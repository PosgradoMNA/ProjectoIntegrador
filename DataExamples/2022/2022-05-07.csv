“This case is now certified as a class action meaning that the named plaintiffs are representatives for the much broader class of consumers” said Michael Galpern partner at Javerbaum Wurgaft Hicks Kahn Wikstrom and Sinins P.C. Voorhees Camden County. “There are four subclasses also certified in this case so every consumer who ingested the tainted water and received notice whether they have an injury or are just obtaining medical monitoring is now part of the case. This ruling significantly expands the group of people who are now part of the case and who will benefit from any settlement in the case.”

Middlesex County Superior Court Judge Michael A. Toto certified the class action lawsuit on April 21.

Tomas Vera of Avenel who suffers from specific health concerns and a severely compromised immune system filed the class action lawsuit in Middlesex County Superior Court on Oct. 29 2021 seeking reimbursement for expenses incurred following the company’s drinking water notice which was sent to customers on Oct. 22. Another notice went out on Nov. 1 expanding the notification.

Vera is joined by residents Joel Velez Margaret Kennedy Donna Zielinski Michael Zielinski Marco L. Nead and Renee Williams as plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

Attorneys Stephen P. DeNittis Joseph A. Osefchen and Shane T. Prince of DeNittis Osefchen Prince P.C. Marlton Burlington County had filed the initial 17-page complaint on behalf of Vera.

Galpern and Zachary M. Green filed the complaint on behalf of a proposed class similar to Vera.

When Vera receiving Middlesex Water Company’s notice on or about Oct. 22 he did “exactly what the notice urged him to do.”

He followed the notice’s “written directives to consult with his doctor and buy bottled water as a substitute for his contaminated tap water. Vera “incurred out-of-pocket expenses including a co-pay for that doctor’s consultation and the cost of bottled water costs which were fully foreseeable to [the water company] at the time of the notice” according to the complaint.

The notice included all residential and retail customers served by the water company’s Park Avenue treatment plant in South Plainfield. Residential and retail customers are in South Plainfield Clark Edison Metuchen Woodbridge and Carteret.

New Jersey is one of seven states that have enforceable regulation drinking water standards for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA).

Jay L. Kooper vice president general counsel and secretary for Middlesex Water Company in a press release on May 4 said the Vera plaintiffs “have sued the wrong party and all efforts should be made to hold the actual polluter of Middlesex Water’s Park Avenue facility the 3M Company accountable for their actions.”

Middlesex Water which has served as a trusted water provider in the area for 125 years has evidence to believe PFOA has been put into the ground by the 3M Corporation and has filed a lawsuit against the corporation in U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey to recoup wellfield remediation costs.

Kooper said similar lawsuits have been filed across the country.

“Middlesex Water Company did not pollute its own water supply” he said. “The Vera lawsuit is misguided unnecessary and even detrimental to the interests of the very people whom these class action attorneys represent. Every dollar Middlesex Water directs to this lawsuit is one less dollar realized from the litigation with 3M that could spare the very Middlesex Water customers the Vera attorneys claim to represent from having to pay the cost to remediate the PFAS pollution for the long-term.”

On Dec. 16 2021 Middlesex Water announced in a statement on its website that it implemented an interim plan which enabled them to turn off the wells in question and provides customers with water from alternate sources which complies with all drinking water standards including the new PFOA standard.

In addition Middlesex Water is in the process of engineering an expanded temporary solution intended to keep the water supply below New Jersey’s maximum contaminant levels while the company completes construction of a water treatment facility to ensure the regulatory standard can be met for the long-term.

“At every step Middlesex Water Company has proactively acted to protect the interests of its customers and to ensure the continued provision of safe and reliable water service” Kooper said. “Part of these actions has been to ensure that the party that caused the exceedance of PFAS in Middlesex’s water supply 3M Company is the party held responsible for the remediation of the water supply. We call upon these class action attorneys in the Vera matter to do the same.”

PFOA/PFAS

PFOA is a member of the group of chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) used as a processing aid in the manufacture of fluoropolymers used in non-stick cookware and other products by 3M as well as other commercial and industrial uses based on its resistance to harsh chemicals and high temperatures.

PFOA has also been used in aqueous film-forming foams for firefighting and training and it is found in consumer products such as stain-resistant coatings for upholstery and carpets water-resistant outdoor clothing and greaseproof food packaging according to the water company.

Current scientific research suggests exposure to high levels of certain PFAS over many years may lead to adverse health outcomes. They are referred to as “forever chemicals” because they do not break down and last in the environment for thousands of years according to the water company.

Following the initial notice municipalities held meetings with their respective residents with representatives from the water company explaining the notice of the exceedance of the PFOA drinking water standard which officials said was a Tier 2 violation.

Municipalities affected by the water company’s drinking water notice banded together to retain Vlasac and Shmaruk LLC Iselin and Berger Montague PC Philadelphia to investigate the actions implemented by 3M and Middlesex Water Company to comply with federal and state safe drinking water standards.

With the notifications Middlesex Water provided literature on PFOA treatment on its website as well as its notice to residents.

The notice stated people with specific health concerns a severely compromised immune system have an infant are pregnant or are elderly may be at higher risk than other individuals and should seek advice from health care providers about drinking the water.

Dennis Doll president and chief executive officer of Middlesex Water noted at the meetings “because the science and research regarding PFOAs in drinking water is not yet mature the medical field does not have any information.”

The New Jersey Department of Health advises that infant formula and other beverages for infants such as juice should be prepared with bottled water when PFOA is elevated in drinking water the notice further stated noting boiling water will not remove PFOA.

Women who are pregnant nursing or considering having children may choose to use bottled water for drinking and cooking to reduce exposure to PFOA. Residents can consider installing in-home water treatment (filters) that are certified to lower the levels of PFAS in the water according to information provided during one of the presentations the water company held.

______

When it comes to compounding wealth we feel that buying high-quality dividend stocks and reinvesting dividends over time is the best path. This allows for not only the capital appreciation that great dividend stocks tend to provide over time but the ability to achieve the double compounding of reinvesting dividends. When executing this strategy however it is paramount to find the best dividend stocks that can stand the test of time.

The Dividend Kings are the best-of-the-best when it comes to dividend longevity. They are a group of 44 companies that have paid rising dividends for at least 50 consecutive years. In this article we’ll highlight why investors would find the Dividend Kings attractive and note the five best Dividend Kings available in the market today.

Why Dividend Kings?

The reason that an investor would want to consider the Dividend Kings is quite simple; they are the best stocks in the world in terms of dividend longevity and safety. Companies that have been able to raise their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years have withstood competitive threats recessions technological changes and more. That’s why the Dividend Kings are the gold standard for dividend investing and while the yields the Dividend Kings offer aren’t always the highest available investors can count on rising income over time very reliably.

Below we’ll take a brief look at the five best Dividend Kings available in the market today.

The Top 5 Dividend Kings Now

Our first Dividend King is Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) the ubiquitous tool and storage maker based in the US. Stanley makes a wide variety of tools and accessories under brands such as BLACK+DECKER Stanley Dewalt Craftsman Porter Cable and more. The company was founded in 1843 and has chosen a growth-by-acquisition strategy to augment its robust organic growth over time. We see the company producing 8% annualized earnings-per-share growth in the years to come meaning it should have plenty of capital to continue raising its dividend.

The current yield is 2.6% which is very high by historical standards for this stock and is about double that of the S&P 500. The dividend increase streak stands at 54 years and the payout ratio is only about one-third of earnings for this year so there is a huge runway for future dividend growth as well as a high level of safety.

Our next stock is Tennant Company (TNC) which designs manufactures and markets floor cleaning equipment globally. Tennant offers a huge array of cleaning equipment to suit a variety of needs as well as financing rental and leasing programs. Tennant was founded in 1870 and recently became an addition to the Dividend Kings club with its 50th consecutive dividend increase.

We expect Tennant to be able to produce 8% annual earnings-per-share growth so combined with its 21% payout ratio for this year the stock sports exemplary dividend safety as well as growth potential. The current yield is 1.6% which is better than the broader market but somewhat lower than more traditional high-yield dividend stocks. However the stock is trading for a decade-low valuation at the moment so we see strong capital appreciation potential over time as well for buyers of the stock today.

Our next stock is 3M Company (MMM) a diversified technology company that operates globally in a variety of industries. The company competes in Safety and Industrial Transportation and Electronics Health Care and Consumer segments spanning thousands of products and countless end markets. 3M has made a name for itself in the past 120 years for innovation and quality and it is constantly revamping its product portfolio to position it well for the coming years.

We see 5% annual growth ahead for 3M and its current yield is exceptional at 4%. That’s high not only for 3M but it is also about three times that of the S&P 500. The payout ratio is just over half of earnings but keep in mind that 3M’s earnings are generally highly predictable so it can carry a higher payout ratio. We like 3M for its exceptional yield its 64-year dividend increase streak and its predictable income streams.

Our fourth Dividend King is Lowe’s Companies (LOW) half of the home improvement duopoly in the US. Lowe’s has about 2000 home improvement super centers in the US offering tens of thousands of products to professionals and property owners. Lowe’s has a 59-year streak of boosting its dividend but despite this the payout ratio is just 24% on this year’s earnings. That means Lowe’s will continue to have enough capital to keep raising the payout particularly in light of estimate growth of 6% annually.

The yield is on the lower end at 1.6% but that is still in excess of the broader market. Lowe’s has managed one of the best dividend growth rates anywhere in the market in the past decade coming in at more than 17%.

Our final stock is Parker-Hannifin (PH) a manufacturer of motion and control systems for mobile industrial and aerospace markets worldwide. The company has more than a century of brand name recognition and expertise which have helped it boost its dividend for a staggering 65 consecutive years. The yield is currently at 1.9% following some weakness in the stock. That has also made the valuation attractive given we expect 9% annual earnings-per-share growth in the coming years. Parker-Hannifin’s payout ratio is just 22% for this year meaning that its projected growth and low payout ratio should provide plenty of fuel for higher dividends in the years to come. The company’s average annual increase in the dividend is just over 10% for the past decade putting the stock is rare company on that measure.

Final Thoughts

When searching for a great dividend stock to buy we believe it is prudent to start the search with the Dividend Kings. They are the class of the field when it comes to dividend safety and longevity and many of them offer either high current yields – like 3M – or high rates of dividend growth – like Lowe’s. We’ve highlighted five names we believe rise to the top of the highly prestigious Dividend Kings and we like all of them as buy-rated stocks in today’s market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdHJpYnVuZS5jb20ucGsvc3RvcnkvMjM1NTY3Ny8zbS13aWxsLW92ZXJjb21lLWFsbC1odXJkbGVzLXRvLXJlYWNoLWNhcGl0YWwtc2F5cy1pbXJhbtIBY2h0dHBzOi8vdHJpYnVuZS5jb20ucGsvc3RvcnkvMjM1NTY3Ny8zbS13aWxsLW92ZXJjb21lLWFsbC1odXJkbGVzLXRvLXJlYWNoLWNhcGl0YWwtc2F5cy1pbXJhbj9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3m will overcome all hurdles to reach capital says Imran,"Focused on motivating the people for a long march on Islamabad later this month former prime minister Imran Khan said on Sunday three million people would overcome all barricades put up by the government and reach the federal capital on his call.

Addressing a public rally in Abbottabad the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chairman told his supporters to wait for his call which could come on any day after May 20. He emphasised that his long march was aimed at “achieving real independence and democracy”.

“I firmly believe that no matter how many containers they will erect more than 3 million people will reach Islamabad. The PTI supporters will reach Islamabad against the ‘imported government’” the former prime minister said.

“This nation will never accept the robbers who came to power through an American conspiracy” he said adding that he could give the call for the march on any day after May 20. “Despite all barricades or hurdles they [the government] will not be able to stop the people from coming to Islamabad.”

In his speech the PTI chief repeatedly accused the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led government particularly Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif of becoming part of a ‘foreign conspiracy’ hatched by the US to bring down his government last month.

He claimed that he was ousted from power because he was pursuing an independent foreign policy and visited Moscow in the larger national interest. “America did not need governments like ours rather it always supports puppets like [former military ruler] Pervez Musharraf and Shehbaz Sharif” he said.

“We’re the followers of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and we don’t bow to any superpower. The entire nation stands on one point today that we will be friends with everyone but will not be slaves of anyone” the former prime minister told a charged crowd.

However he added that he was happy to say that he had never seen the Pakistani nation coming together in this way. “The nation took to the streets people are angry at the imposition of corrupt people and the overthrow of the [PTI] government through [foreign] intervention.”

Imran alleged that Prime Minister Shehbaz accepted the slavery of foreign power just to save his illegal business empire made through illegal means. He asked the prime minister to return the “looted money back to Pakistan”.

The PTI chairman bitterly criticised the PML-N leaders and the top leadership of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). “Asif Zardari Hamza Sharif and Rana Sanaullah – 60% of the present rulers are on bail in various cases they have no future” he added.

Imran said that the PML-N had been trying to escape from the general elections adding that the party had left no place even in central Punjab. He also mentioned that state institutions were neutral but added: “If you are neutral you are supporting falsehood”.

TOTTENHAM are emerging as favourites to sign Blackburn's England youth centre-back Ashley Phillips - in a deal worth up to £3million.

The 16-year-old has been a stand-out for the Rovers' youth sides impressing particularly in the Premier League 2 this season.

Manchester United and Chelsea have also been tracking the young defender.

Phillips' contract expires in 2023 however it is believed Spurs are ready to get the deal done as quickly as possible.

The North London side are looking to get the deal done for around £3m.

Phillips- who is 6ft4in tall - has received plaudits for his dominant PL2 performances earning himself regular training time with the Blackburn first team.

This time training alongside established club stars such as Ben Brereton Diaz and Bradley Dack has also caught the eye of former manager Tony Mowbray.

Mowbray said to Lancs Live: ""Ash is just a phenomenal young boy.

""If you were to create a defender in the mould of how you would want one this kid has got every attribute.

""But he is still just a young boy. He needs time which is why he's training with the first-team so that he gets confident and used to the level of intensity.""

Spurs' interest in acquiring a promising centre-back may be a sign of confidence in current manager Antonio Conte who often operates with three central defenders.

With Conte squads built on strong foundations at the back acquiring young stars who have already drawn comparisons to Virgil van Dijk could be the sign of very smart business in North London.

On Saturday night his Spurs side defended resolutely as they earned a point against quadruple-chasing Liverpool at Anfield."

ABT,Abbott,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vdGhld2Vlay5jb20vYnJpZWZpbmcvMTAxMzA3Ni9hYmJvdHQtYW5kLXRoZS1ib3JkZXItYnVzaW5nLWV0Y9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What is Texas Gov. Greg Abbott doing with the southern border?,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has made waves with his aggressive southern-border policies as of late. Here's everything you need to know:

Is Gov. Abbott busing migrants out of Texas?

Yes. In response to the Biden administration's decision to suspend a COVID-era public health order at the U.S.-Mexico border (note: that annulment is now currently up in the air) Abbott began busing migrants from Texas to Washington D.C. where he claims they'll be better taken care of. The caravans are largely understood as an Abbot-led rebuke of the federal government's immigration policies though critics claim the effort turns migrants into ""political pawns.""

The governor's first migrant bus pulled into D.C. on April 13 right where he said it would: blocks from the U.S. Capitol. ""Biden refuses to come see the mess he made at the border"" Abbott tweeted that day. ""So Texas is bringing the border to him.""

Meanwhile the White House has appeared unphased by the unconventional move. In one particularly buzzworthy moment Press Secretary Jen Psaki dismissed the whole maneuver as a ""publicity stunt"" but other than that it's been left mostly unaddressed.

Though Title 42 — the public health order in question and object of Abbott's ire — was never meant to be permanent it's become almost a de facto piece of U.S. immigration law in the minds of its supporters especially once officials predicted a surge in migration as a result of its revocation. Critics however have argued that the measure — which allows the U.S. to quickly expel migrants for reasons related to COVID-19 — was never actually that helpful to public health and has ultimately done more harm than good.

Is Abbott's plan working?

The migrants are making their way to D.C. sure but it's unclear if anyone is as rattled as Abbott was perhaps hoping. At least for the time being the arrangements might even sound like a sweet deal to some.

That's because the long bus rides are paid for by the state of Texas and migrants aren't actually required to make the journey — the decision is voluntary. Once they disembark in D.C. they're then greeted by volunteers who will ""help them reach their desired destinations around the country to await their day in immigration court"" The New York Times reports. One passenger — Chadrack Mboyo-Bola — outright thanked Abbott upon arrival. Another Cuban migrant Reydel Grau told the Times he is ""very thankful to the governor. His help is very much welcomed.""

""In a way it's actually perfect"" Bilal Askaryar spokesperson for Welcome With Dignity a migrant assistance collective told the Times. ""Unintentionally Governor Abbott sent them to one of the best places in the nation to welcome people … It might not have been the governor's intention — I think he clearly wanted to create some kind of chaos — but the reality is that we're really well prepared and really excited to welcome these people.""

Notably those traveling to D.C. from the border are ""only a fraction"" of the thousands crossing daily the Times notes. If the number of D.C.-bound passengers grows Washington would certainly have a problem — as would the vulnerable migrants dropped in an unfamiliar city. For now however totals have remained manageable.

What about other controversial border policies of Abbott's?

The same day he announced his bus plan Abbott also ordered state troopers to conduct secondary inspections of vehicles crossing into Texas from Mexico a controversial directive that only served to back up border traffic snarl supply chains anger Mexican truckers and send business to a more-welcoming New Mexico. Abbott rescinded the policy on April 15 just nine days after enacting it but not before it cost the U.S. almost $9 billion.

The additional inspections which were intended to root out drug and migrant smuggling seemingly failed. Per The Houston Chronicle the extra searches despite having cost Texas a purported $4.3 billion amounted to zero migrant detentions and zero illegal drug seizures. The governor simultaneously however ""persuaded Mexico states to enhance security on their side of the border"" added an email from Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller the Chronicle reports.

Abbott previously made headlines with his Operation Lone Star a March 2021-launched initiative aimed at bolstering security along the Texas-Mexico border due to ""insufficient policies from the federal government"" The Texas Tribune reports. But the entire endeavor has proven controversial; ""National Guard troops have called it a disaster and migrants arrested on state trespassing charges have gotten caught in [confusing] legal proceedings their lawyers citing due-process violations"" the Tribune writes. The governor's office meanwhile maintains that the operation has been a success.

The leader is also said to be weighing invoking actual war powers so he could ""seize much broader state authority on the border"" the Times writes noting Abbott could do so by declaring an ""invasion."" But such a move is risky and would ""put the state in a head-on collision with the federal government by allowing state police to arrest and deport migrants"" the Times reports.

What's the political angle here?

Well it's an election year and Abbott's now-famous border policies are perhaps intended to establish him as ""President Biden's most visible adversary on immigration and the staunchest border hawk in his party"" writes The Washington Post.

Especially given the incumbent governor's rumored 2024 presidential ambitions ""[p]icking a fight on immigration keeps him on the news"" claimed one Republican donor who has organized fundraisers for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) another reported presidential hopeful.

Dana Milbank a columnist for the Post agreed: ""The stunt is part of a fortune in Texas taxpayer money that Abbott is spending for the benefit of his gubernatorial re-election campaign and potential presidential bid."" He's using the border as an ""expensive campaign prop"" added the El Paso Times' editorial board.

""It's clear that in Abbott's view of politics nothing matters more than winning"" continued James Moore for CNN. ""Not even Texas.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb2xpdGljby5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA1LzA3L2ktZG9udC1rbm93LWhvdy1teS1zb24td2lsbC1zdXJ2aXZlLWluc2lkZS10aGUtZGFuZ2Vyb3VzLXNob3J0YWdlLW9mLXNwZWNpYWx0eS1mb3JtdWxhcy0wMDAzMDc4N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'I don't know how my son will survive': Inside the dangerous shortage of specialty formulas,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/07/i-dont-know-how-my-son-will-survive-inside-the-dangerous-shortage-of-specialty-formulas-00030787 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb2xpdGljby5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA1LzA3L2ktZG9udC1rbm93LWhvdy1teS1zb24td2lsbC1zdXJ2aXZlLWluc2lkZS10aGUtZGFuZ2Vyb3VzLXNob3J0YWdlLW9mLXNwZWNpYWx0eS1mb3JtdWxhcy0wMDAzMDc4N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vdGhlLWNpcmNsZS1wYXJrZXItYWJib3R0LXdvcnN0LWNhdGZpc2gtZWxpbWluYXRlZC1kYWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Circle: Why Parker Abbott Was The Worst Catfish So Far,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vdGhlLWNpcmNsZS1wYXJrZXItYWJib3R0LXdvcnN0LWNhdGZpc2gtZWxpbWluYXRlZC1kYWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA1LzA3L3RleGFzLWdvdi1ncmVnLWFiYm90dC1tYXktZmlnaHQtbGF3LWFsbG93aW5nLWlsbGVnYWwtaW1taWdyYW50LWtpZHMtZnJlZS1wdWJsaWMtc2Nob29saW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas gov may fight law allowing illegal immigrant kids free public schooling,"Texas Gov.

In 1982 the Supreme Court ruled that illegal immigrant children have the constitutional right to attend public school for free in a decision known as Plyer v. Doe. The high court made the ruling after schools in Tyler Texas tried to charge such children a $1000 tuition.

“Plyer is a 40-year-old decision that dealt with immigration in the state of Texas that was extremely different than it is now” Abbott said at a press conference in Houston.

Abbott said Texas was mostly seeing Mexican immigration then and there was only the need to teach the Spanish language at schools in the state.

Now Abbott said Texas is seeing immigrants from 105 different countries who speak dozens of languages and the cost to hire teachers would present a burden on state taxpayers.

The governor said it costs the state of Texas about $7500 per child annually but the cost would be greater for immigrant children who need special instruction.

“That leads to education obligations as well as other obligations that are simply unsustainable and unaffordable. It should be the federal government not the state of Texas footing this bill” said Abbott.

In the Plyler case four immigrant families were represented by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund who had a swift reaction to Abbott’s intent to challenge the law.

“Greg Abbott has once more distinguished himself as one of our most irresponsible and desperate politicians. The Plyler decision he said is firmly established by the court and has also been endorsed by Congress” Thomas A. Saenz president and general counsel of MALDEF said in a statement.

But since the Supreme Court is seemingly willing to overturn established legal precedent by ending federal protection for Roe v. Wade according to a leaked memo Abbott signaled the court could be taking a fresh look at other legal precedents.

Of the Supreme Court’s upcoming decision on abortion Abbott said the court should not wait to get its ruling out.

“I strongly urge the court to get that decision out this week. Don’t wait around and don’t allow the bullying to occur on the streets whether it be in front of the Supreme Court or around the United States. Get the decision out now. The public has seen it. Get it out” said Abbott.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRheS5jb20vbG9jYWwtbmV3cy8yMDIyMDUwOC9hYmJvdHRzLWxvYnN0ZXItaW4tdGhlLXJvdWdoLWNlbGVicmF0aW5nLTc1dGgteWVhci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Abbott's Lobster in the Rough celebrating 75th year,"Jennifer McGrail left laughs as her father Michael Turner both of Massachusetts watches her carry the tray of food to their table at Abbott´s Lobster in the Rough in Noank on Sunday May 8 2022.

Groton — Nestled along the Noank shoreline the critically acclaimed Abbott's Lobster in the Rough has been a staple for seafood lovers for three-quarters of a century.

Celebrating its 75th year of operation at 117 Pearl St. Abbott's opened for the season last Friday and on Sunday people bundled up in winter coats celebrated Mother's Day by sitting at one of the waterside picnic tables and enjoying a lobster roll steamers and other seafood.

One of those choosing to sit inside Sunday was Rosemary Coggeshall of Glastonbury who along with her family was also celebrating her son Michael's 21st birthday in a few days.

Coggeshall is a big Abbott's fan. She said her family has come to Abbott's every year for Mother's Day except for the past two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic. She said her husband Jim has been going to Abbott's for decades.

""You got the water views and the salt in the air which somehow increases your appettite for seafood"" Coggeshall said. ""You can't be a Connecticut person and not come to Abbott's. They're synonymous.""

Established by the late Ernest Abbott in 1947 Abbott's operated for a time as a lobster wholesaler and cannery and since the 1950s as a seasonal restaurant.

Chelsea Leonard said her grandparents Jerry and Ruth Mears bought the restaurant from the Abbott family in 1981 keeping and honoring the already well-known Abbott's name. Chelsea the daughter of operator Deirdre Mears transitioned into a leadership position at the restaurant in 2016. She has since helped her mother operate the business and expand it opening an Abbott's outpost in downtown Mystic last year.

To be celebrating 75 years is a milestone said Leonard.

""We're really proud of the restaurant and what we do here"" she said. ""Seventy-five years speaks to the loyalty and dedication we've had to the business and it is certainly not easy.""

Leonard said it's not getting any easier for restaurants and the COVID-19 pandemic made things more challenging. While Abbott's was still busy amid COVID-19 restrictions Leonard said the pandemic exacerbated supply chain issues and increased labor costs and shortages.

""Lobster prices and costs in general are going up"" she said. ""We're doing our best to keep prices down.""

The rising prices did not appear to affect business Sunday as a number of visitors filled up Abbott's parking lot. Many of the visitors were celebrating Mother's Day with their families.

Abbott's was what Nicole Arciszweski of Clinton said she wanted to eat after hiking at nearby Bluff Point State Park earlier in the day with her family. Arciszweski sat on a blue blanket laid across Abbott's green lawn as she watched Tobias her nearly 1-year-old son walk and play with his toys.

Arciszweski said she was celebrating her first Mother's Day as her son due last Mother's Day came into the world a week later. She said she has been to Abbott's a couple of times including when she was younger. Arciszweski had ordered her favorite steamers.

""They remind me of when I was a kid and my mom used to get them"" she said.

Accenture’s Seabury air cargo consultancy in the Netherlands appears to have experienced a mass walkout after five former managers set up a new company Rotate.

Rotate’s website explains that its aim is to help airlines turn data into action.

“We target all domains that drive the commercial performance of airlines: from sales optimisation and dynamic pricing to revenue management contract management and revenue leakage.”

The company added modestly: “We don’t have the ambition to disrupt the entire industry we simply would like to help airlines do 3 to 7% better.

“With our unique mix of cargo strategy consulting and tech experts we help airlines to create workable solutions to monetise earlier investments in data and systems and bring a fresh point of view to topics that have proved frustratingly tough to crack.”

It is unclear who remains at the Dutch arm of Seabury which was bought by Accenture in 2017 with many key names now at Rotate including Ryan Keyrouse Jonathan Mellink Lars Meijs and Ronald Veldman.

Gert-Jan Jansen Rotate’s founder (pictured above) left Seabury in 2020. Only Rotate’s tech entrepreneur and engineer Lauren ten Hoor was not formerly at Seabury.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN1bHRhbmN5LmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzLzU0MTQvc3BlbmRpbmctc21hcnRlci1ub3QtbW9yZS1vbi1jeWJlcnNlY3VyaXR5LXJlc2lsaWVuY2XSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb25zdWx0YW5jeS5jb20uYXUvbmV3cy9hbXAvNTQxNC9zcGVuZGluZy1zbWFydGVyLW5vdC1tb3JlLW9uLWN5YmVyc2VjdXJpdHktcmVzaWxpZW5jZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Spending smarter not more on cybersecurity resilience,"Profile Accenture

Cybersecurity budgets in Australia are rising fast. But according to new research by Accenture the key to cybersecurity success lies not just in total spend – but also how wisely budgets are spent. Mark Sayer APAC Cyber Defence Lead at Accenture explains why.

Cybersecurity budgets in Australia are up. Accenture new report State of Cybersecurity Resilience revealed that 84% of companies are spending more money to combat cyber threats and 20% have expanded their budget by more than 10%.

While most organisations today invest hard work and real money to protect their organisation our experience shows only a handful of control failures can undo it. And because 76% of respondents said staying ahead of threats is a battle they can't afford long term effective – not just expensive – security investment is key.

Good cybersecurity resilience can often be seen as a blocker. However the research found some security leaders are working closely with their businesses to strike a workable balance – we call these organisations ‘Cyber Champions’.

Although Cyber Champions demonstrate strong security resilience they’re not necessarily the companies that spend the most. The secret is that when compared to other organisations Cyber Champions view cybersecurity in a fundamentally different way – more as a risk of doing business as opposed to a compliance issue.

Closer together

The alternate view started when the CISO was made a critical part of the business conversation not a departmental buried deep within the technology practice. Those that did it best had a closer relationship with the CFO CEO and board. They were more trusted and had more autonomy.

Only 19% of Cyber Champions said their cybersecurity expenditure had to be approved from higher up than their direct reporting line. Those closer relationships help align the security strategy to the broader business goals.

On the other hand companies that took a more traditional approach with stricter security mandates but weaker alignment with business strategies didn't perform quite as well as Cyber Champions when it came to the number and impact of cyber incidents despite often investing more.

Our research also found that understanding and perceptions about organisational cyber resilience tended to differ between cybersecurity executives and non-cybersecurity executives. Cybersecurity executives felt that they had a much better handle on security threats than their non-security executive counterparts. Conversely the non-security executives felt that security was better funded than the security executives.

This disparity suggests a lack of shared understanding about the security mission across the leadership spectrum and further supports the idea that security leaders can be more effective when they are more closely aligned with their business.

Establishing a company as a ‘Security Champion’ is certainly not a simple undertaking but the results speak for themselves. Companies that do cybersecurity well take a holistic view aligning security at every point along with the transaction with customers suppliers and beyond. Simply spending more on cybersecurity will be like throwing good money after bad. There’s no evidence that you will get a better result and it's not sustainable in the long term.

As the threat landscape continues to deteriorate and the cybersecurity industry matures security leaders need to evolve beyond IT operations and take a seat at the table with the business leadership.

Like a CFO CEO or CIO security leaders need to be clear on their business objectives; they need to educate their business listen carefully to their colleagues and establish a security strategy based on business outcomes not the latest technology widgets or following what everyone else is doing.

Proven results

According to our research Cyber Champions stopped more attacks found and fixed breaches faster and experienced less damaging impacts. Those at the top of their game spent an average of $294000 less per cyberattack – around half what the next best performers did.

Cybersecurity resilience requires continued investment that much is certain. But the Cyber Champions of our industry show us that wiser investment and a closer working relationship with business leaders can deliver better outcomes more cost-effectively than taking a compliance-led or policy-based approach.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2RldGFpbC8wMDAwNDI0ODQ0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary for Kelly Elizabeth Winston,"Kelly Elizabeth Winston

DHgate a Chinese cross-border business-to-business e-commerce platform is doubling down on the fast-growing social commerce sector which means a person's entire shopping experience－from product discovery to the check-out process－takes place on a social media platform as part of its broader push to accelerate the digital transformation of traditional global trade.

China's Generation Z consumers those born between the mid-1990s and the early 2010s have shown a rising demand for personalized niche and intelligent products said Diane Wang founder chairperson and CEO of DHgate adding the company attaches great importance to the purchasing power of the younger generation.

According to her the sales of intelligent equipment such as robot vacuum cleaners scooters and wearable devices via the online platform of DHgate surged more than 200 percent year-on-year in 2021.

Gen Z accounts for one-third of the global population becoming the largest generation group in the world said a survey conducted by data.ai a US-based mobile analytics company. Their strong willingness to consume is leading the global consumption trend and bringing great changes to global trade.

""As for the booming social commerce segment we aim to help Chinese manufacturers brands and small and medium-sized enterprises access global private domain channels as well as empower Gen-Zers and content creators including internet celebrities key opinion consumers and brand owners""Wang said.

The global social commerce industry is expected to grow three times as fast as traditional e-commerce to $1.2 trillion by 2025 said global consultancy Accenture. The growth is predicted to be driven primarily by Gen Z and millennial social media users accounting for 62 percent of global social commerce spending by 2025.

DHgate is exploring new possibilities in the cross-border e-commerce industry driven by social media. It launched MyyShop a social commerce software-as-a-service or SaaS platform in 2020 which connects Chinese supply chains with people owning substantial private domain traffic or influencers on social networking platforms worldwide.

Myyshop also provides social media-based services such as artificial intelligence-powered smart product selection and smart logistics services and helps micro small and medium-sized enterprises especially entry-level merchants and individuals with social influence run their online stores as direct sellers.

Wang said the relationship between production and consumption in the global trade and the global supply chain is being reshaped in the social commerce era. ""Everyone can participate with a much lower entrance level including small and micro-entrepreneurs and social media creators.""

She added the number of active users on MyyShop increased 76.3 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of this year while the number of paying users rose 65.6 percent year-on-year with the gross merchandise value or GMV skyrocketing by 845.5 percent on a yearly basis.

""Currently MyyShop works with more than 50 000 influencers and content creators worldwide. Our goal is to reach 500000 influencers and content creators across the globe this year"" Wang said.

Social commerce empowers smaller brands and individuals and makes big brands reevaluate their relevance for a marketplace of millions of individuals said Oliver Wright global consumer goods and services lead at Accenture.

Being engaged in the social commerce sector means working together within a dynamic ecosystem of platforms marketplaces social media and influencers to share data insights and capabilities to deliver the right incentives and best consumer experience across an integrated digital marketplace Wright added.

Founded in 2004 DHgate serves more than 2.4 million registered suppliers and over 46.6 million registered buyers covering 223 countries and regions around the world with more than 100 international logistics routes and over 10 overseas warehouses.

""China's young generation is emerging as mainstream consumers and becoming the driving force in the growth of homegrown brands due to their higher disposable income as well as personalized and diversified demand"" said Bai Ming deputy director of the international market research department at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.",,,

Try these fixes

In most cases the broken or outdated graphics driver is the main culprit behind the Premiere Pro crashing issues.

If you haven’t updated your graphics driver for a long time or if the graphics driver file is broken or corrupted you may suffer from the program crashing stuttering and even screen flickering issues.

Graphics card manufacturers like Nvidia AMD and Intel keeps updating their graphics drivers. By doing that they’ll fix bugs in the last version of graphics driver and enhance the graphics card performance. Sometimes they also provides support for the new features in creative applications. For example:

The March NVIDIA Studio Driver provides optimal support for the latest AI-powered features in creative applications including Adobe Camera Raw Adobe Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve 17.

In other words the latest graphics driver will unlock the full potential of your graphics card and give you a better experience for creating and gaming.

There’re mainly two ways you can update your graphics drivers:

Option 1: Manually

You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right the driver online download it and install it step by step.

Your graphics card manufacturer keeps updating drivers. To get them  you need to go to the website of your graphics card manufacturer:

Then find the graphics driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example Windows 64 bit) and download the driver manually.

Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

Or

Option 2: Automatically (Recommended)

This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

If you don’t have the time patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.

Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

If the latest graphics driver fails to stop the crash just read on to try the next fix below.

Fix 2: Reset your preferences

According to Adobe resetting your preferences is a useful fix to stop Premiere Pro from crashing. If you haven’t tried this fix yet just give it a shot.

It’s quite easy to reset your preferences. Here’s how:

Hold the Alt key when you click to launch Premiere Pro. This will invoke a popup asking if you want to reset your preferences.

Click OK to confirm.

See if the Premiere Pro crashing issue persists. If this fix doesn’t stop the crashing don’t worry. Try the next fix below.

Fix 3: Turn off GPU acceleration

GPU acceleration is one of the common causes of Premiere Pro crashing. If you’ve turned on GPU acceleration temporarily disable it to see if you can fix Premiere Pro crashing. Here is how to do it:

Launch Premiere Pro and go to File > Project Settings > General.

In the Video Rendering and Playback part set Renderer option to Mercury Playback Engine Software Only. Click OK to save the change.



See if Premiere Pro crashes after you switched GPU acceleration to Software Only. Usually Premiere Pro may take more time to finish rendering after you disabled GPU acceleration but it would reduce the frequency of random crashes.

If this fix doesn’t work try the next fix below.

Fix 4: Remove media cache files

Some corrupted media cache files may also trigger Premiere Por crashing issue. If it’s the case you need to remove media cache files. Here is how to do it:

Launch Premiere Pro and go to Edit > Preferences > Media Cache.

Click the Delete… button to remove media cache files.



See if this fix stops the crashing. If not try the next fix below.

Fix 5: Close CPU / memory hogging applications

Premiere Pro is a resource intensive application. If you’re running lots of applications at the same time in the background your computer may run out of RAM and causes Premiere Pro to crash. If it’s the case closing those CPU / memory hogging applications may get Premiere Pro work again Here is how to do it:

On your keyboard press Ctrl Shift and Esc at the same time to open Task Manager. You will be prompted for permission. Click Yes to open Task Manager. Select any other applications and programs that take up a large amount of CPU or memory then click End task to close it.



If Premiere Pro works well after you closed those CPU / memory hogging applications congratulations!

To prevent Premiere Pro from crashing due to insufficient memory in the future you may need to consider upgrading the memory (RAM) on your computer.

Fix 6: Check for overheating components

Premiere Pro utilizes both CPU and GPU to perform heavy computations. If Premiere Pro runs on your computer for a long time your computer may get overheated especially when its cooling system is not working properly. Once your computer got overheated Premiere Pro may crash without warning. If it’s the case you need to cool your computer down.

To cool down your computer you may need to

Clean the dust from the fans and vents of your computer.

from the fans and vents of your computer. Make sure your computer is in a cool environment.

Use a better cooling system for your computer if yours is not powerful enough.

If none of the fixes works try updating / reinstalling Premier Pro. Normally after updating Premier Pro to the latest version or reinstalling it you’ll fix the crashing issue.

Conclusion

In most cases keeping Premier Pro Windows OS and drivers up to date would get rid of most program crashing issues. If these common fixes on this article didn’t help you fix the Premiere crashing issue you can also try investigating Windows crash logs to analyze and troubleshoot the causes of the crash.

Titled BlobGAN the method involves creating a grid of ‘blobs' – mathematical constructs that map directly to content within the latent space of the GAN.

By moving the blobs you can move the ‘objects' in a scene representation in an intuitive manner that's nearer to CGI and CAD methods than many of the current attempts to map and control the GAN's latent space:

Since blobs correspond to ‘objects' in the scene mapped out in the GAN's latent space all the objects are disentangled a priori making it possible to alter them individually:

As with any object in photo editing (or even text-editing) software a blob can be duplicated and subsequently manipulated:

BlobGAN can also parse novel user-selected images into its latent space:

More results can be seen here and in the accompanying YouTube video (embedded at the end of this article). There is also an interactive Colab demo* and a GitHub repo**.

This kind of instrumentality and scope may seem naïve in the post-Photoshop age and parametric software packages such as Cinema4D and Blender have been allowing users to create and customize 3D worlds for decades; but it represents a promising approach to taming the eccentricities and the arcane nature of the latent space in a Generative Adversarial Network by the use of proxy entities that are mapped to latent codes.

The authors assert:

‘On a challenging multi-category dataset of indoor scenes BlobGAN outperforms Style-GAN2 in image quality as measured by FID.'

The paper is titled BlobGAN: Spatially Disentangled Scene Representations and is written by two researchers from UC Berkeley together with three from Adobe Research.

Middle-man

BlobGAN brings a new paradigm to GAN image synthesis. Prior approaches to addressing discrete entities in the latent space the new paper points out have either been ‘top-down' or ‘bottom up'.

A top-down method in a GAN or image classifier treats images of scenes as classes such as ‘bedroom' ‘church' ‘face' etc. This kind of text/image pairing powers a new generation of multimodal image synthesis frameworks such as the recent DALL-E 2 from OpenAI.

Bottom-up approaches instead map each pixel in an image into a class label or category. Such approaches use diverse techniques though semantic segmentation is a popular current research strand.

The authors comment:

‘Both paths seem unsatisfactory because neither can provide easy ways of reasoning about parts of the scene as entities. The scene parts are either baked into a single entangled latent vector (top-down) or need to be grouped together from individual pixel labels (bottom-up).'

Rather BlobGAN proffers an unsupervised mid-level representation or proxy framework for generative models.

The Gaussian (i.e. noise-based) blobs are depth-ordered and represent a bottleneck in the architecture that assigns a mapping to each entity solving the biggest hurdle there is to GAN content manipulation: disentanglement (also a problem for autoencoder-based architectures). The resulting ‘blob map' is used to manipulate BlobGAN's decoder.

The authors note with some surprise that the system learns to decompose scenes into layouts and entities through an off-the-shelf discriminator which does not use explicit labels.

Architecture and Data

Entities in the blob map are converted into images via a revised StyleGAN2-derived network in an approach that takes inspiration from prior NVIDIA research.

StyleGAN 2 is modified in BlobGAN to accept input from the blob map instead of a single global vector as is usually the case.

By analogy instead of bringing a vast and complex building (the latent space) into existence all at once and then having to explore its endless byways BlobGAN sends in the component blocks at the start and always knows where they are. This disentanglement of content and location is the major innovation of the work.

AMD,Advanced Micro Devices,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA1LzA3L2JldHRlci1idXktYW1kLXZzLWludGVsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Buy: AMD vs. Intel,"How do these companies compare and which stock can better serve investors right now?

The rivalry between Intel (INTC -0.94%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.87%) is nearly as old as the semiconductor industry itself. As the larger company Intel led the way for most of that time.

However since Lisa Su assumed the CEO position at AMD in 2014 AMD's stock has bounced back from penny-stock status delivering returns of nearly 30-fold during her tenure. Meanwhile Intel stock floundered for several years. Still Intel has begun to stage a revival of its own in the past year raising the question of if it's time to consider Intel or does AMD stock remain the better investment? Let's see if we can find an answer.

The case for AMD

When Su became CEO the declining market for PCs had decimated AMD. And with its stock trading well below $5 per share many investors had given up on the chip design company.

However Su changed AMD's emphasis turning its focus to high-performance computing. She also set the company on a plan to catch up to Nvidia and surpass Intel. Consequently AMD has challenged Nvidia in many niches and released its first 7nm chip in 2019 a feat Intel has still not met.

Today its enterprise embedded and semi-custom segment (EESC) has become AMD's growth driver. This includes its EPYC CPUs the server businesses and gaming console chips. The computing and graphics segment consists of the Ryzen and Radeon GPUs notebook and desktop CPUs and data center chips. Also with the Xilinx acquisition complete AMD has gained a segment focused on the supercomputing market.

The main segments have kept growth at impressive levels. In Q1 AMD reported $5.9 billion in revenue a year-over-year increase of 71%. This includes 88% more revenue in the EESC segment and a 33% increase in computing and graphics.

Non-GAAP net income also shot 148% higher over the same period to almost $1.6 billion as the company limited the growth of its expenses to 44%. This growth should also continue as the company forecasts about $26.3 billion in revenue for 2022 60% more than in 2021.

Unfortunately these increases have not helped it escape the recent sell-off in tech stocks and AMD stock has dropped 40% from its 52-week high. But that decline helped take its P/E ratio down to 39 a multiple that remains well under Nvidia's 53 P/E ratio. When comparing that valuation with revenue growth many investors may consider AMD stock a buy now.

The Intel comeback plan

Long an industry leader Intel has struggled amid management turmoil and the loss of its technological edge. So significant were its woes that the chipmaker that long manufactured its chips began outsourcing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -1.20%) better known as TSMC

However the company changed direction when the current CEO took the top position in February 2021. He founded Intel Foundry Services making the company a competitor of TSMC and Samsung. To support this business he has began an aggressive building campaign investing $40 billion in the U.S. and 80 billion euros in Europe to add capacity.

Gelsinger also wants to reclaim the technical lead for Intel. He has set a goal of producing 7nm chips by next year and surpassing TSMC as early as late 2024. Nonetheless chip development cycles take three to five years. So Intel has much to prove before investors know whether it will meet its development goals.

Moreover these objectives could pressure its struggling financials. Q1 2022 revenue came in at $18.4 billion. While that still makes Intel the second-largest chipmaker behind Samsung revenue fell 7% from year-ago levels. It also reported non-GAAP income of $3.6 billion 35% less than one year ago. The rising cost of sales and higher expenses cut deeply into profits.

Additionally since 2022 revenue forecasts of $76 billion amount to only about 1% growth it will probably not surprise investors that the stock price fell by more than 20% over the last year.

However these conditions have taken Intel's P/E ratio to just eight the lowest earnings multiple among major industry players. If Intel can meet most of its goals it appears positioned for an eventual comeback.

So AMD or Intel?

As conditions stand now AMD looks like the better buy. Yes it is considerably more expensive but unlike Intel it has massive growth to push it higher.

Still investors should consider revisiting this question in future quarters. Chip development cycles take much longer than the 15 months Gelsinger has served as Intel's CEO so the jury is still out on his strategy. But if Intel can show it's meeting revenue and technological goals it could turn into the semiconductor stock of choice.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vaW52ZXN0b3JwbGFjZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8zLWNvbXBhbmllcy1qdW1waW5nLW9uLXRoZS13ZWItMy0wLXRyYWluLW52ZGEtYW1kLXUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Companies Jumping on the Web 3.0 Train,On May 8 a 25-year trading veteran reveals the “market maker” strategy that’s pinpointing gains as high as 197% 317% even 1147% in 30 days or less.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9hbWQtcmFkZW9uLXJ4LTY5NTB4dC1mZWF0dXJlcy1uYXZpLTIxLWt4dHgtZ3B1LXN1cHBvcnRzLWh5bml4LWFuZC1zYW1zdW5nLTE4Z2Jwcy1tZW1vcnnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD Radeon RX 6950XT features Navi 21 KXTX GPU supports Hynix and Samsung 18Gbps memory,"AMD Navi 21 KXTX

Chiphell community was quick to find BIOSes in TechPowerUP database. Although they were already removed they confirm high TGP ranges for RX 6950XT SKU their power limits and what memory they support.

Two of the cards listed there were MSI RX 6950XT GAMING X TRIO and SAPPHIRE RX 6950XT NITRO+ Pure. Although the latter has power limit set to 325W it can further be adjusted by 20% which means as much as 390W of power. The power limit for MSI card is 332W and up to +12% increase which is 372W. Do note that those are TGP (GPU+memory) not TBP. This means that full graphics card power will easily be beyond 400W.

The RX 6950XT model will ship with Navi 21 KXTX GPU not XTXH as previously rumored. This means that AMD now has a fourth variant of Navi 21 GPU for its consumer Radeon series. Although this is just a codename that could ‘theoretically’ be flashed over XT or XTXH variants.

However there is a reason why one should not do it. The BIOS only supports 18 Gbps memory from HYNIX and Samsung. The latter appears to be the same variant as RX 6500XT memory uses (designated as HC18).

Between 1968 and 1989 Gilley posted 46 entries on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart which included 17 No. 1s among 34 top 10s. He also posted 27 entries on Top Country Albums encompassing 10 top 10s. Two LPs hit No. 1: 1974’s Room Full of Roses and City Lights which reached the pinnacle in 1975.

More from Billboard

Gilley who was born in Natchez Miss. on March 9 1936 hit the top of Hot Country Songs with his first of 17 leaders in June 1974 when “Room Full of Roses” led for a week. His final trip to the penthouse was also his only collaboration to hit No. 1: 1983’s “Paradise Tonight” with Charley McClain.

Gilley was at the peak of his career in 1980 when the film Urban Cowboy was released. Much of the movie starring John Travolta and Debra Winger and featuring Gilley was shot at Gilley’s the gigantic honky-tonk in Pasadena Texas which the singer opened in 1972. The club’s prized possession was the mechanical bull which Travolta’s character “Bud” rode numerous times. (Sadly the club burned down in an arson fire in 1990.)

The Urban Cowboy soundtrack remained at No. 1 on Top Country Albums for eight weeks beginning in August 1980 and peaked at No. 3 on the all-genre Billboard 200 in September 1980 during a 53-week run.

Also from the movie soundtrack was Gilley’s version of Sam Cooke’s “Stand by Me” which topped Hot Country Songs. It climbed to No. 22 on the Hot 100 in August 1980 becoming Gilley’s lone hit on the all-format survey.

Gilley’s last appearance on Hot Country Songs was in 1989 when “There I Said It Again” reached No. 53 that August.

Due to changes in chart methodology over the years eras are weighted differently to account for chart turnover rates over various periods.

Armstrong spoke to press in London on Sunday (8 May) after he collected Matthew MacFadyen’s Bafta for Best Supporting Actor for his role on Succession.

“We’re almost done with the writing for season four here in London with the American writers coming over” Armstrong said according to Variety. “They’re a really great group of people to talk about the nuances of character and the world and what we’re doing on the show.”

He also told members of the press he was excited to share the script with the show’s cast members because “it’s useful” since they “think things about their characters”.

Commending Macfadyen’s win at the Bafta TV awards Armstrong also said the actor who plays Tom Wambsgans on Succession always has a “delicate response” to the script.

“He can do anything as an actor” he added.

When asked about the show’s future and how long it might run for Armstrong said that while he doesn’t think Succession should go on forever he confirmed everyone associated with the wildly popular HBO drama is “still having fun at the moment”.

The first three seasons of Succession are available for streaming on HBO Max in the US and NOW in the UK.

The Bafta TV awards took place at London’s Royal Albert Hall on Sunday with comedian and actor Richard Ayoade presenting. You can find a full list of winners here."

Among products checked were clothing pillow protectors bedding and furniture.

“It’s definitely a concern because these toxic chemicals can make their way into children’s bodies” said Laurel Schaider one of the study’s authors.

PFAS or per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances are a class of more than 9000 compounds typically used across dozens of industries to make products water- stain- or heat-resistant. They’re in thousands of everyday consumer products such as stain guards cookware food packaging and waterproof clothing.

The chemicals are linked to cancer birth defects liver disease thyroid disease decreased immunity hormone disruption and a range of other serious health problems. They’re dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down and they accumulate in humans.

The peer-reviewed study was conducted by the environmental health research group Silent Spring Institute and published in the Environmental Science and Technology journal. It aimed to provide a sense of the chemicals’ use in products that come with labeling suggesting it’s environmentally friendly or protective from stains and water. The study is not intended to provide a representative sample of children’s textiles.

It detected PFAS in 54 of 93 products including 21 with labels such as “eco” “green” or “non-toxic”. The chemicals were most widely used in products labeled “water-” or “stain-” resistant.

PFAS in clothing can get in the body via several routes. The chemicals are volatile meaning they can break off from the products to which they’re applied then move through the air and be breathed in. They can also attach to dust that’s breathed in or ingested or they can be absorbed through the skin.

Silent Spring most frequently detected the chemicals in upholstered furniture clothing and pillow protectors and the latter two generally contained the highest PFAS levels.

Nearly 20 products contained multiple kinds of PFAS including PFOA a highly toxic compound that regulators and industry claim has been phased out because of its danger but which is still regularly detected in the US. Products that contained PFOA were made in China.

It’s difficult for consumers to avoid the chemicals because they aren’t listed on tags but the study provides some helpful hints Schaider noted. Products labeled “stain resistant” most commonly contained the chemicals as PFAS are often the main ingredient in stain guards like Scotchgard.

“That might mean making a lifestyle decision to live with stains” Schaider said.

Products labeled “waterproof” also frequently contained the chemicals. Navigating “eco” and “green” labels is also difficult because there’s no legal definition for the terms and they can be “meaningless” marketing Schaider said.

Third party companies will certify products as environmentally safe but there’s no uniform standard and some companies don’t consider PFAS in their certification. That’s partly because PFAS are a newer chemical than toxins like lead but Schaider said certifiers “could do a better job”.

The best solution she added is a ban on PFAS outside of essential uses such as medical devices where there isn’t a substitute chemical.

“Where it is just a nice-to-have feature but we don’t really need it – all of these textile products fall into that category – it’s not worth it to introduce these forever chemicals into the home” Schaider said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZnN0b3BwZXJzLmNvbS9nZWFyL2RpcnR5LXNlY3JldHMteW91ci1jYW1lcmFzLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJlci02MDMxODjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Dirty Secrets of Your Camera's Manufacturer,"Hey camera manufacturers! Stop lying to us.

We photographers are environmentally aware. Camera and equipment producers however are failing us. Most are only protecting their bottom lines while causing significant damage to the environment.

So how environmentally friendly is your camera manufacturer? How much CO2 do they produce? Do they use mostly recycled materials? Are their products recyclable? Do you know? If you can’t find this information without difficulty if it isn’t highlighted in an easy-to-understand format and if they are making a big noise over small projects then they are guilty of greenwashing.

Let’s start with the good by celebrating the filter and accessory company Urth formerly known as Gobe. They produce exceptional filters at far more affordable prices than many of their competitors. Significantly they more than offset their carbon footprint by actively planting trees in rainforests. Each time we buy a filter from them they plant five trees. Their website has clear information about what they are doing now and where they are placing effort to improve.

When exploring options to offset our impact we quickly realized tree planting was the best way to do that because trees sequester carbon purify water and rejuvenate ecosystems. We fund tree planting projects run by Eden Reforestation Projects – our tree planting partner – to plant five trees with every Urth product and provide employment for people affected by deforestation.

So far they have planted over five million trees offsetting more than 1.6 million tons of CO2. Their ambitious target is to reach a billion trees by 2032. They are also committed to using low-impact materials. The longevity of their products that results from their quality keeps them out of landfills. All their packaging is recyclable too. What’s evident is their honesty and openness about their products. They give easy to find precise understandable data about what impact their products have and what they do to address that.

Consequently the business is thriving.

Sadly most other photographic companies are not so open hiding what little they are doing by greenwashing. These companies do one of two things. They either produce enormous inaccessible documents that are impressive to look at boring to read but have little substance or they don’t publish data at all.

Let’s take Canon as an example. They provide a mass of documentation that requires someone with lots of time on their hands and a significant understanding of environmental data to find the relevant information. You do have to search hard for the report but when you find it and scroll through to page 47 of 133 pages it says that in 2020 the production of their raw materials resulted in an estimated 3147000 tons of CO2. The development production and sales generated a further 940100 tons. Transport of their products to their sales and other outlets 304000 tons. This amounts to just under 4.4 million tonnes of CO2. That’s before adding on a further 2.264 million tons resulting from their products’ use. They say their total product lifecycle of CO2 is higher than that at 7.72 million tonnes.



How much does the production of a Canon camera impact our planet? More than many realize.

To put this into context the average American produces 19.8 tons of CO2 per year.

On top of that their production process releases 0.8 tons of sulfur oxides which can dissolve in water to form sulfuric acid. 47.9 tons of nitrogen oxides which can dissolve to form nitric acid. They also emit 372 tons of controlled chemical substances as well as discharge 6.755 million cubic meters of wastewater.

In a bold headline of a flowchart is the word “Recycling.” They used 1248 tons of reused parts and 2303 tons of recycled materials. Great! Yet this is a drop in the ocean compared to the 616000 tons of new resources used to produce their goods.

They claim they have good news and they make a big noise about their CO2 production has dropped significantly over the years. But it is still huge and that reduction seems painfully slow.

They also shout about their Bird Branch project which involves “bird centered activities.” That includes surveying migratory birds adding nesting boxes to their site cleaning nests and encouraging people to photograph birds. Does this sound like a significant contribution to the environment? To me it doesn’t.

Does photographing birds do much to to help protect them?

Compared to some other big businesses Canon is doing better but when you contrast it to the effort put in by the relatively small company Urth then they don’t sound so impressive do they?

It should also be noted that they also help with humanitarian aid to the tune of 8 million yen ($62462 USD) as part of a total social contribution of 2.2 billion yen (approximately $17 million). That sounds notable too but with net sales at 5.51 trillion yen ($30.55 billion) it represents about 1/1800th of that. Meh!

Sony’s Road to Zero webpage has impressive infographics that talk about curbing climate change promoting biodiversity controlling chemical substances and conserving resources. But the webpage contains no real substance. Their “aim to provide environmentally conscious products” and “minimizing consumption and maximizing recycled materials” or their declaration to “establish our own chemical substance management standards” and saying “we are aware that our operations may affect the natural environment in various ways” are all typically vague statements used in greenwashing.

Their global environmental plan says Sony is “striving to achieve a zero environmental footprint” throughout the life cycle of their products and businesses by 2050. Yet this is just a target not a measurement of success.

You must tap on the small hamburger menu to find their data and their performance results. Even then they are only shown in percentages. Their highlighted 5% drop of energy consumption doesn’t reveal they are in fact still using a massive 25000 terajoules (25000000000000000 joules.)

Delving deep into Sony’s corporate website you can download a PDF document that reveals their true environmental impact. On page 131 and 132 of a 199-page document you can discover that in 2020 their sites alone produced over 1.2 million tons of CO2. But there are another 17-million tons produced from other factors such as purchased goods and services transport and distribution waste employment commuting and mostly the use of their sold products accounts for 11403000 tons alone. Note that Sony doesn’t use the metric ton so the numbers appear smaller.

Like Canon Sony hides its true environmental impact deep within its website.

They also produced 15.45 million cubic meters of wastewater. However they have one notable success: of their 51000 tons of other waste they recycle all except 1000 tons of it.

Like Canon Sony is gradually getting better but are they doing it quickly enough? To me it seems like they are not.

Nikon too is aiming for zero carbon emissions by 2050. Exceeding its target of an 18.2% reduction from 2014 to 2021 achieving a 25.9% reduction still averages out at just 3.7% per year. Also as we saw earlier a 25.9% reduction of an enormous number still leaves an enormous number.

They too hide their actual CO2 production figures on page 47 of their sustainability report: 182625 tons. The also emit 3297 cubic meters of wastewater 27 tons of Dichloropentafluropropane (stratospheric ozone depletion global warming and health impacts) 10 tons of toluene (membrane damage to the leaves in plants toxicity to marine life harmful to human health) and so on.

Nikon highlights their participation in Earth Hour. That’s just one hour out of 8760 hours per year.

Of course these are just the three biggest companies and I am sure most other businesses are performing similarly poorly and hiding their results in similar ways. Furthermore the problem won’t just be limited to the photographic industry but most manufacturers in most industries. Indeed Canon Sony and Nikon all produce more than just cameras.

So let’s start pressuring the manufacturers all of them to tidy up their acts and let them give us these ten reasons to buy from them.

1. Publish and highlight clear and understandable environmental data that your consumers can easily access and understand.

2. Own up to your failings and address them quickly.

3. Demonstrate your commitment by making ambitious year-on-year targets for reductions in CO2 that reach zero far sooner than 2050.

4. Stop fobbing us off by spinning your data and greenwashing your performance.

5. Offset your entire current CO2 production and more with tree planting in areas that have suffered deforestation and like Urth join the global network of 1% for the Planet.

6. Switch to renewable energy at all manufacturing plants.

7. Change your production processes to reduce hazardous and environmentally harmful chemicals and prevent them from entering the environment.

8. Make your products recyclable and use recycled materials in their manufacturing.

9. Encourage and help your customers to do the same.

10. Reduce your wastewater. In the meantime let us photographers shame these big rich corporations shouting about the minute actions they take. We should also encourage them to do much better by using the power of our wallets. When possible let’s buy products that are demonstrably better for the planet.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyZ2FhbS5jb20vZW4vYXJ0aWNsZS9hcnRpY2xlZGV0YWlsL2lkLzE1NTc2NDLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NEOM Green Hydrogen names David Edmondson as CEO,"Logo of Neom

Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky recently announced that the company’s employees will be able to work from anywhere including (for up to three months) overseas. He also abolished location -based pay at least within the U.S. In the days following the announcement Airbnb’s recruiting page received a million visitors. The company which laid off a quarter of its staff during the pandemic also released first quarter earnings that closely matched pre-pandemic levels.

Chesky who has decamped from San Francisco and has been living entirely in Airbnbs this year sat down with TIME in an Airbnb above a cosmetics store in downtown Manhattan to talk about the future of the office corporate culture how to redesign working spaces (he’s a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design) and how he steered the company through its darkest days.

This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

Is it your belief that the office is over?

I think that the office as we know it is over. It’s kind of like an anachronistic form. It’s from a pre-digital age. If the office didn’t exist I like to ask would we invent it? And if we invented it what would it be invented for? Obviously people are going to still go to hospitals and work people are going to still go to coffee shops and work—those spaces make complete sense. But I think that for somebody whose job is on a laptop the question is well what is an office meant to do?

I do think people are going to need space and people aren’t going to all want to work from home. I think a number of things are going to happen though; the office has to do something a home can’t do. So maybe private offices will come back in vogue where people can’t work from home and they need a space and the company will have a space available. But will they need to work around other co-workers? I think you’re going to see a lot of people not even living in the same area; the only place you’ll have to be for the most part is the internet. The past two years I’ve worked in all different cities—people probably didn’t even know— I was in Atlanta Nashville Charleston Miami Colorado and it didn’t make any difference. People will still go to offices but it’ll be for different purposes for collaboration spaces. And if people go into an office for collaboration do they need to go to New York City or can they go to a retreat in upstate New York?

You’re going to see a lot more flexibility. I think the talent pool is going to be much more distributed. Not everyone’s going to limit themselves to a community radius around their office. The way to see the future is not to look at the big banks and the old companies. If you want to know what the workplace future looks like look at young companies because young companies basically don’t have any legacy. And young companies are flexible they’re mobile they’re kind of more nomadic. I think that’s probably what the workplace of the future will look like in 10 years.

So what happens then to something like corporate culture it just goes out the window?

Will there still be corporate cultures? Of course. I would argue our culture [at Airbnb] is pretty strong and we’re going to get together one week a quarter. If it turns out a week a quarter is not enough we’ll get together more. But my suspicion is a week per quarter is probably going to be enough human connection for the average person to come together and bond.

You go to those big skyscrapers and all those CEOs telling you that they have to come back to the office… First of all most CEOs are from a different generation. Young leaders are going to think quite differently. Of course young people also like community. It’s hard to make friends on Zoom there’s a lot of limitations: people become invisible your bubbles become smaller. Zoom can have some pernicious effects on diversity on young people on minorities I think there’s a lot of negative potential ramifications for zooming. I’m not trying to paint a rosy picture of the future; there’s going to be a lot to work out. All I’m saying is you can’t fight the future we can’t try to hold on to 2019 any more than 1950. We have to move forward.

The solution is going to be a true hybrid not three days in the office. It’s going to be total flexibility and then gathering in an immersive way when you need. This is going to be how most technology companies will operate. And I believe almost every company will be a technology company in 10 years. Technology will proliferate so much that every company will just feel more like a technology company. There will be some analog companies—there will still be coffee shops. But even media companies are becoming tech companies; it’s all converging.

You’re speaking of this as something that you think will happen but not something you necessarily endorse?

No no I endorse it. But I do think it can be really bad. I don’t want to paint an overly simplistic view. On balance it’s good for diversity. Why is it good for diversity? Let’s take Airbnb: Before the pandemic we had to mostly hire from San Francisco. How diverse is San Francisco? Not very. So we decided let’s open offices in Atlanta because Atlanta is more diverse and we can hire more people from a more diverse background. But the truth is that the solution for diversity should be truly being able to hire people from everywhere. That’s the upside. The downside is a world of too much Zoom and too much remote work is a world where people can feel lonely and disconnected. Pure Zoom is not going to work. You’ve got to do something in between. The in-between has been what people call hybrid—two to three days a week. My prediction is three days a week becomes two days a week and two days a week becomes one day a week and pretty soon are you really in a hybrid world or are you mostly a remote world? People don’t realize this two-three days a week thing is not super sustainable. People are going to realize “O.K. let’s be more intentional about when people gather. And let’s gather for a week or two at a time.”

Another downside is that with remote work employees don’t get subjected to the same social influences to people with wildly different views and to having to collaborate with people they didn’t choose. Do you worry about that?

Yeah. I agree with the concern. If we were to abstract it at a larger level physical communities are getting digitized. The mall became Amazon—and there’s some great things about that. But the problem is you go to the mall and you see people different than you and you’ve got to look people in the eye and bump up to people you have to wait in line and wait for the person be courteous and you don’t get to pick everyone around you. On the internet you could create a hermetically sealed bubble of people just like you. Suddenly you can live in your own reality.

I am concerned about physical communities getting completely digitized with no physical substitutes. I don’t know if that means that we should bring malls back. And I don’t know if that necessarily means that we should bring back the office culture of the past.

I do think it means that we are going to need to design physical ways for people to come together. The thing about human connection is it’s inefficient. Technology is like gravity; it wants to find the fastest point between point A and point B. If we’re not careful in the name of efficiency we will try to remove all human connection. And if we do that we live in a world with no community where people are lonely where everyone’s got a mental health crisis and you can see where this starts to go. I’m an optimist. We don’t have to go down that road. We can design meaningful moments where people come together but it’s going to require us to actually be creative and think: How will people come together in the future? What will they do?

You are by training a designer one of the few CEOS who went to the Rhode Island School of Design. Have you thought about what the physical spaces might be?

Yes but let me preface this by saying that if we talk in a year or two I will be much more intelligent because we’re basically all at the beginning of an experiment. These are like theories in my head right? I might change my answer once I test it—designers like to prototype something and then say “Yeah I guess that doesn’t really work.” But here’s my theory: I think that we need to move from multi-use spaces to more single-use spaces. An analogy would be that before the iPhone there was a Blackberry and the problem with the BlackBerry as Steve Jobs pointed out was that the keyboard was there whether you needed it or not. If you want to watch a video you don’t need the keyboard there. The great thing about a touchscreen is it could become whatever it needed to become— a calculator a screen a photo album. I’d like to see something like that with the office.

Let’s say for example you want to do a giant gathering of everyone together. What creative people really want is a lot of pin-up space and tables in the center of a room kind of standing tables where you don’t have to sit. Engineers are going to want a totally different thing. I think we need to move toward fewer multi-use spaces. Historically pre-pandemic tech offices were an open sea of desks with a perimeter of meeting rooms with no private offices. There wasn’t a lot of privacy. There were some good things about it but there were some bad things.

If retail investors bought your stock on the close of the first day of your IPO in December 2020 they wouldn’t have made any money on it by today. If they bought Marriott they would have made a lot. Does this worry you?

I saw some comments on Twitter yesterday saying this is the worst that the stock market has been—at least for high tech companies—since the dotcom crash. To say it’s a correction is probably an understatement. I’m not going to speculate on whether or not we’re on the verge of recession. Big tech companies have basically held their value but everyone else is like a third or half. I’m not bothered by the stock price because I’ve made the decision that I need to focus on what I can control. And the stock price is a mood. And the mood by the way is not even really associated with our company. Two or three days ago we [announced] $1.2 billion in free cash flow [for the first quarter of 2022]. I would encourage people to buy our stock if they want to hold it long term.

Early in the pandemic you had a billion dollars in cancellations; either the hosts were going to lose money or the guests were going to lose money. You decided it would be the hosts. Was that the darkest day for you?

Late March to May 5 2020 were dark. The saddest day was definitely May 5 the day of the layoff. The layoff was like a combination of darkness upon darkness upon darkness. There was the layoff there was the fact that it wasn’t the easiest to raise money you know and we ended up raising debt. The walls were kind of caving in in every direction. In a crisis it’s all about optimism. You have to have optimism that’s rooted in reality that’s believable so people will follow you up a mountain. And I felt like if we could just not quit just keep going we could preserve what’s special about our service and our best days would be ahead of us. I never lost faith. It was very dark but it wasn’t existential to me in the same way it was to others. I never had doubts that we’d make it but I wouldn’t have begrudged people if they had questions because it didn’t look good from the outside.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjN2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL21hcnJpb3R0LWFpcmJuYi1yZW50YWwtcHJvcGVydGllcy1uZXctYnVzaW5lc3MvMTE4MjkwMTkv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly9hYmM3Y2hpY2Fnby5jb20vYW1wL21hcnJpb3R0LWFpcmJuYi1yZW50YWwtcHJvcGVydGllcy1uZXctYnVzaW5lc3MvMTE4MjkwMTkv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marriott International takes on Airbnb by offering private home rentals,"The hotel chain said it created its homes and villas offering to meet the growing demand for short-term rentals.

As a mum of two Airbnb is my source of income however it is rewarding to know that hosting my guests contributes to the renewal of the economy and city at large. I love hosting and meeting new people from all parts of Australia and the world. I enjoy sharing tips on what’s happening in my own city and events like Vivid Sydney always create memorable experiences for my guests. For anyone considering being a Host I would highly encourage other Sydneysiders to give it a go and take advantage of this beautiful event. Felicity Stevens Airbnb Superhost

Susan Wheeldon Airbnb’s Country Manager for Australia and New Zealand said as creatives families and visitors prepare to stay in Sydney for the renowned festival of lights there’s never been a better time to host on Airbnb.

“Hosts on Airbnb play a valuable role in making guests feel extremely welcome and our Sydney-based Hosts are no exception. Our Hosts are very passionate about showing off the patch they call home – we know our local Hosts will point guests in the best direction to experience the city as it comes alive during Vivid Sydney.

“Airbnb wants to make it as easy as possible to sign up to be a Host by offsetting the $65 short-term rental accommodation registration fee with the NSW government by giving new Hosts a coupon to that value.

“Hosting allows people to take typically their most significant asset – their own home – and turn it into an income engine.

“Many New South Wales Hosts on Airbnb share their own home to help combat rising costs of living and meet mortgage repayments. In turn these Hosts help drive economic growth and job creation in the Sydney area and many local businesses rely on the valuable tourism dollars spent by Airbnb guests.

“It’s easy to become a Host on Airbnb – in fact we last year announced a new simplified process for becoming a Host in just 10 easy steps. You’re in full control of your availability prices house rules and how you interact with guests and each and every reservation is covered for free by our Million Dollar Host Guarantee and our Host Protection Insurance.

Minister for Enterprise Investment and Trade Minister for Tourism and Sport and Minister for Western Sydney Stuart Ayres said Vivid Sydney would showcase the harbour city to the world.

Each year Vivid Sydney transforms the city into a vibrant fusion of creativity innovation and technology and is a major celebration of our creative industries. After two years it is exciting to bring back Vivid Sydney and welcome visitors to our incredible city for the best festival of light in the world. Every visit every stay every meal at a restaurant or drink in a bar is a welcome boost for businesses and ensures the state’s economic recovery.

It is often credited with popularizing the modern version of the can-can.

The Moulin Rouge has attracted visitors from all over the world for over 130 years. Unbeknownst to most is a secret space inside the windmill on top of the theater that has never been accessible to the public — until now.

The theater was opened by Joseph Oller and Charles Zidler in 1889 and is located at the foot of Paris' Montmarte Hill. It's considered one of Paris' historical landmarks. It is also a cultural icon — it was used as the setting of the 2001 Baz Luhrmann film ""Moulin Rouge!"" starring Nicole Kidman.

Oller was a Spanish entrepreneur while Zidler was a showman who managed the cabaret. They wanted to create an entertainment venue for people from all walks of life including both the rich and the poor.

The theater had to be rebuilt when the original building burnt down in 1915. The fire razed everything to the ground leaving ""only the façade and a portion of the stage"" standing per the International Herald Tribune.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb2tlc21hbi5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyL21heS8wOC90aGUtZnVsbC1zdWJ1cmJhbi1zdGF5aW5nLWluLWFtaXNoLWFuZC1oYXVudGVkLWFpci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Full Suburban: Staying in Amish and haunted Airbnbs,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2022/may/08/the-full-suburban-staying-in-amish-and-haunted-air/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb2tlc21hbi5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyL21heS8wOC90aGUtZnVsbC1zdWJ1cmJhbi1zdGF5aW5nLWluLWFtaXNoLWFuZC1oYXVudGVkLWFpci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The institute is a result of the amalgamation of the Ethiopian Space Science and Technology Institute (ESSTI) and the Ethiopian Geospatial Information Institute (EGII). The amalgamation represents the implementation of a 10-year strategic plan by the Ethiopian government to operate a competitive space and geospatial program under a central Space Technology and Geospatial Institute (STGI).

The amalgamation was made into law via an enactment by the Ethiopian House of People’s Representatives of proclamation 1263/2021 to re-establish a new institutional arrangement for the Federal Democratic Republic Government of Ethiopia. As a result the STGI will become operational this year with core technical centres and technical directorates that will align with national priorities and global trends in the geospatial and space industries.

While the importance and value of the geospatial information and space program have been well recognised by the Government of Ethiopia since the early 1950s. In 1954 the Ethiopian Mapping and Geography Institute was established under the Ministry of Education and Arts to produce fundamental geospatial datasets to support national development agendas. The institute has gone through several restructuring and was renamed several times. In 1998 it was renamed the Ethiopian Mapping Agency (EMA) and migrated to the Ministry of Finance and Cooperation to manage cartographic and digital mapping and remote sensing in the country. In 2018 the agency was renamed the Ethiopian Geospatial Information Institute (EGII) as a way of restructuring. With about 400 employees EGII engages in aerial photography photogrammetry geodetic surveying and spatial data infrastructure among other things for planning infrastructure monitoring irrigation elevation maps urban planning and structural and regional planning.",,,,,,,,,,,,

""This is a special day for Iowa and for the renewable fuels industry"" Gov. Kim Reynolds said at the German-owned Verbio Nevada Biorefinery which is making renewable natural gas from corn cobs husks and other crop residue it buys from central Iowa farmers.

The plant occupying the site of the former DuPont cellulosic ethanol facility between Nevada and Ames on Lincolnway Highway is expected when fully operation to make renewable natural gas that contains the energy equivalent of 19 million gallons of ethanol each year. It also will produce 60 million gallons of corn-based ethanol annually.

Reynolds said she was impressed with Verbio's vision and innovation when she first heard about the project in 2019. She said she also was impressed with the ""opportunities to continue to lead and grow an industry that is very important to Iowa.""

The state is the leading U.S. producer of ethanol and the corn that's used to make it.

No other company in the U.S. is making renewable natural gas using farm residue at an industrial scale said Claus Sauter CEO of Verbio AG the publicly traded German company that is the parent of Verbio Nevada.

""But it will not be the last"" Sauter adding that Verbio AG plans to open new renewable natural gas facilities potentially one each year in the U.S. The company said in a statement it could open up to 10 plants within five years.

""We are committed to the U.S. particularly in Iowa as evidenced with the $150 million investment we are making here. And our plans are bigger much bigger"" Sauter said. ""With the right biofuels policies in place we believe Iowa and the U.S. have immense potential.""

Carbon dioxide byproduct also will be put to work

Sauter told a couple hundred people attending the event that the company envisions using carbon dioxide a byproduct of the plant's production to eventually make synthetic natural gas and chemicals in partnership ""with a big German chemical company.""

""We see CO2 as a product not a waste. It's a new business line"" he said telling Reynolds the company will need ""government's help.""

Sauter said the company will buy 100000 tons of the crop residue known as corn stover annually from central Iowa farmers as well as 20 million bushels of corn to make ethanol.

Ron DeJongh Verbio North America's president said the company will spend close to $1 million buying stover from about 100 area farmers.

Verbio employees providing tours of the facility said the stover is ground up then pumped into massive silos that serve as anaerobic digesters. Bacteria breaks down the plant material and biomethane rising to the top of the digesters is captured and refined. Solid digestate pressed to reduce moisture is the basis for a soil conditioner similar to compost that farmers can use to add nutrients to their soil.

More:What we know about three carbon capture pipelines proposed in Iowa

DeJongh said the digesters are fed with distillers grain left over from ethanol production. Eventually he said the plant will use byproducts to make fertilizers for organic crop production.

Officials said the renewable natural gas is pumped directly into an Alliant Energy pipeline which distributes it to customers in Iowa and across the country.

The utility helped the company meet renewable natural gas standards and regulations so the energy could be sold in other states they said.

Sauter said the nation has room to expand renewable natural gas production under the Renewable Fuel Standard a federal mandate that calls for production of ethanol biodiesel and other advanced renewable fuels. Almost all U.S. gas is blended with at least 10% ethanol.

More:The internet says a bird pooped on Joe Biden in Iowa. Here's what really happened.

Federal officials expected the nation by this year to be producing 16 billion gallons annually of advanced biofuel the category under which renewable natural gas falls. But the country has met less than 4% of that goal Sauter said.

Reynolds said that at a time when Russia's assault on Ukraine ""threatens our food and energy supply chains restoring our energy independence has never been more important.""

Sauter said the plant has about 50 employees and will employ another 50 when it completes its second phase of construction next year.

Verbio which fully funded the project received about $3.9 million in tax incentives from the Iowa Economic Development Authority.

The company also received county property tax breaks officials said.

ALL,Allstate,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA1LzA4L2RvZXMtYmVya3NoaXJlLWhhdGhhd2F5LXRoaW5rLXByb2dyZXNzaXZlLWlzLWEtYmV0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Does Berkshire Hathaway Think Progressive Is a Better Auto Insurer Than GEICO?,"Here's what Warren Buffett had to say.

The past few years have seen companies like Tesla and General Motors looking to enter the automobile insurance market. These manufacturers see an opportunity to offer insurance to customers because of the amount of data collected from their vehicles.

However Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Warren Buffett said he has no worries about auto manufacturers entering the insurance market. Instead Warren Buffett is more concerned about Progressive's (PGR -0.02%) edge regarding insurance. Here's why.

A two-horse race for the leading auto insurer

GEICO has been around since 1936 but was purchased by Berkshire Hathaway in 1996. According to Forbes GEICO is the fourth-largest auto insurance company with a 9.5% market share. Only State Farm Allstate and Progressive have higher market shares.

However when it comes to future leaders Warren Buffett sees two companies that could become the top auto insurer -- GEICO or Progressive.

Buffett went on to say that ""I have always thought for a very long time [that] Progressive has been very well run. They have an appetite for growth. Sometimes they copy us. Sometimes we copy them. And I think that will be true five years from now ten years from now.""

Risk management is key to running a successful insurance business

Ajit Jain is Berkshire Hathaway's vice chair of Insurance Operations and is on Berkshire Hathaway's board of directors. Jain has a deep knowledge of the insurance business and ran Berkshire's reinsurance business before stepping up to his current position. Jain noted that Progressive had a significant advantage over GEICO with regard to the loss ratio.

The loss ratio is a crucial metric insurance companies use; it's the ratio of losses to premiums earned. This ratio can give you an idea of how much of your earned premiums are used to resolve claims made by clients. Good companies can control losses and keep loss ratios in check. This is something that Progressive has done exceptionally well.

According to Jain Progressive has a 12-point advantage over GEICO when it comes to the loss ratio -- a significant margin in the industry when competition is so high. According to Jain ""There are a number of causes for that but I think the biggest culprit is as far as Geico is concerned...is telematics.""

Progressive has a nearly 10-year head start on this technology

Progressive's telematics or pricing insurance policies based on driving habits is a huge advantage. Progressive was the first in the industry to use telematics when it rolled out the technology in 2010 -- giving it a considerable advantage.

Telematics works like this: Driving data is collected from devices installed on cars or through a cellphone app. This app enables Progressive to collect mileage speed braking time and when you drive during the day.

Progressive can develop personalized rates from this data and give drivers discounts for safe driving. When it comes to pricing models the more data the better. And since Progressive has over 10 years of driver data it has better models to manage risks and keep loss ratios low.

Investor takeaway

GEICO is working to catch up to Progressive. In 2019 the insurer joined other auto insurers that began to use telematics. Jain noted ""My hope is that in the next year or two Geico will be positioned to catch up with Progressive.""

Progressive has an incredible advantage over other insurers because of its built-up knowledge of telematics. As an investor in Progressive it gives me added confidence that this is a stellar stock to hold for the long haul.

Even Charlie Munger vice chair of Berkshire Hathaway admitted ""In the nature of things every once in a while somebody is a little better at something than we are.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbG9ubWFya3MuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy8yMDIyLzA1LzA4L21hdHQtY29ycmFsLXRoZS1iaWdnZXN0LXN0ZWFsLWluLXRoZS1kcmFmdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Matt Corral: The biggest steal in the draft,"Unlike past drafts the 2022 NFL draft was not a big draft on quarterbacks. Only one quarterback Kenny Pickett out of Pitt was drafted in the first round.

Matt Corral perhaps the most talented quarterback in the draft fell to the third round at pick number 94.

Corral was once considered a first-round pick but fell due to an injury in the 2022 Sugar Bowl and off-field issues.

Corral entered 2021 as a heavy Heisman candidate after a fantastic sophomore season and started the season off hot. Production declined as the year went on for Corral but the California native still put up solid numbers.

Corral finished his junior year throwing over 3300 yards with a 68 completion percentage. He threw 20 touchdowns with only five interceptions.

Corral also rushed for 600 yards and 11 touchdowns. Corral’s running ability is one of his more underrated attributes. His mobility will help him well in the league.

Corral led the Ole Miss Rebels to a 10-2 record and a Sugar Bowl appearance. This was the Rebel’s first ten-win season in school history.

Unfortunately Ole Miss fell to Baylor in the Sugar Bowl largely in part because Corral went down in the first half with an ankle injury and did not return.

The injury was luckily nothing too serious. With no breaks or tears Corral only suffered a high ankle sprain.

Fully recovering from the injury was one of the reasons he did not participate in the NFL combine. Despite dealing with the setback Corral has repeatedly stated multiple times that he does not regret playing in the bowl game.

His consistent display of leadership on and off the field is the biggest reason he is such a steal. Unlike other top-notch draft picks Corral decided not to opt-out of the bowl game.

He stated that he would not be where he was without his teammates and couldn’t leave them behind. Corral has repeatedly been described as a “locker room” guy that is great with his teammates.

This is the type of player fans would want to lead a team.

Regardless of his ankle the other main reasons Corral fell so low were due to his battles with alcoholism and depression. Corral has been very open about his issues regarding his mental health.

It has also been stated that his behavior is unreliable which most likely stems from these issues. Corral also reportedly struggled a lot in meetings that he had with some NFL teams.

Corral has stated that these issues are behind him. It also shows a lot about his character that he opened up to the media about his battles.

A lot more athletes than people think deal with mental health issues and it is rare to see them open up about it.

Even though Corral has had some trials and tribulations he is easily one of the most talented players in the draft. His 6-foot-2 frame and outstanding arm talent will be a problem for many teams in the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL2RrbmV0d29yay5kcmFmdGtpbmdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzUvOC8yMzA2Mjc4Ni9nZXJyeS1ib2hhbm9uLXRyYW5zZmVyLXJ1bW9ycy1iYXlsb3ItcWItY29tbWl0cy11c2Ytc291dGgtZmxvcmlkYS1kZXB0aC1jaGFydC1zY2hlZHVsZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gerry Bohanon transfer rumors: Former Baylor QB commits to South Florida,"Former Baylor Bears quarterback Gerry Bohanon has committed to South Florida according to his social media. This is a big get for USF as Bohanon put up major numbers for the Bears en route to a Big 12 championship a season ago.

Baylor transfer QB Gerry Bohanon has committed to USF.



No. 4 in our best available transfer ranks: https://t.co/Zsgo8McEeQ pic.twitter.com/UYi24cV7Rp — Max Olson (@max_olson) May 8 2022

Bohanon isn’t going to generate Heisman buzz initially but the dual-threat quarterback was certainly considered a darkhorse contender for the 2022 season. Bohanon finished last season with 2200 passing yards 18 passing touchdowns and seven interceptions. He also added 323 rushing yards and nine rushing touchdowns. While he’s unlikely to elevate USF into College Football Playoff contention Bohanon could put up big numbers here.

For now Bohanon will be competing with incumbent Timmy McClain for the starting job. McClain was electric in his freshman season for the Bulls throwing for 1888 yards and five touchdowns. He did struggle with interceptions so that’s an area Bohanon could have the edge. Other quarterbacks on USF’s depth chart include Katravis Marsh and Cade Fortin.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vb250YXBzcG9ydHNuZXQuY29tL2JsYWNraGF3a3Mvcm9ja2ZvcmQtaWNlaG9ncy1zd2VlcC10ZXhhcy1zdGFycy1hZHZhbmNpbmctdG8tZGl2aXNpb24tc2VtaWZpbmFsc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rockford IceHogs Sweep Texas Stars Advancing To Division Semifinals,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://ontapsportsnet.com/blackhawks/rockford-icehogs-sweep-texas-stars-advancing-to-division-semifinals on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vb250YXBzcG9ydHNuZXQuY29tL2JsYWNraGF3a3Mvcm9ja2ZvcmQtaWNlaG9ncy1zd2VlcC10ZXhhcy1zdGFycy1hZHZhbmNpbmctdG8tZGl2aXNpb24tc2VtaWZpbmFsc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZmFuc2lkZWQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvMDgvbmV4dC13d2UtcHB2LWFmdGVyLXdyZXN0bGVtYW5pYS1iYWNrbGFzaC1oZWxsLWluLWEtY2VsbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,When is the next WWE PPV after WrestleMania Backlash?,Next.

Huawei spent $22 billion on R&D 2021 to tackle the US sanctions

Few companies can afford to invest to overcome US sanctions on a scale that Huawei can afford. One of China’s largest tech giants had to spend $22.1 billion in research and development in 2021. This is significantly more than most companies around the world. Huawei simply had no other choice amid US sanctions.

Over the past five years Huawei has almost doubled its R&D investment accounting for 22.4% of its revenue in 2021—nearly twice as much as a percentage of revenue than Amazon or Alphabet spent and more than three times as much as Apple. According to Bloomberg only Meta allowed itself to spend 20.9% of its income on similar purposes. Rising costs demonstrate Huawei’s determination to survive at all costs by developing chips. It is also developing networking equipment and even smartphones amid sanctions without US technology. Restrictions on the company have been in place since 2019 when Washington accused it of endangering US national security. Due to sanctions Huawei‘s revenue in 2021 fell by about a third.

China’s largest tech giant almost doubled its R&D budget over the past half-decade to $22.1 billion in 2021 — more than any company in the world outside America. That’s 22.4% of its sales that year: nearly double Amazon.com Inc.’s and Google-owner Alphabet Inc.’s proportions. It is more than triple iPhone-maker Apple Inc.’s. Only Meta Platforms Inc. came close among the so-called Faang contingent with 20.9% data compiled by Bloomberg shows.

Bernie Sanders took Amazon to task Thursday at a congressional hearing bashing the online giant’s leadership for fighting union drives and questioning whether the federal government should continue contracting with the multibillion-dollar company.

Amazon executives didn’t attend the hearing but U.S. senators did hear from labor unions and the U.S. Government Accountability Office.

Sanders who chairs the Senate Budget Committee used the panel’s broad jurisdiction to highlight Amazon’s high turnover rate in its warehouses located throughout the country National Labor Relations Board rulings against the company for anti-union activities and “inadequate” workplace safety policies.

“I think the taxpayers in this country want to know that when their tax dollars are going to contracts with companies that those companies obey the law” Sanders said. “I don’t think that’s asking terribly much.”

Sanders an independent who ran in the Democratic presidential primary in 2016 and again in 2020 called on President Joe Biden to fulfill a promise he made while campaigning “to institute a multiyear federal debarment for all employers who illegally oppose unions” and to “ensure federal contracts only go to employers who sign neutrality agreements committing not to run anti-union campaigns.”

Sanders said he believed Biden to be sincere when making those pledges adding that “the time for talk is over the time for action is now.”

Graham sees ‘dangerous turn’

South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham vehemently disagreed with Sanders’ characterizations of Amazon saying that while the company is subject to federal laws it shouldn’t have to be subjected to the hearing.

“This committee is taking a very dangerous turn under your leadership to be honest with you” said Graham the top Republican on the committee. “You’re singling out a single company because of your political agenda to socialize this country.”

Christian Smalls president of the Amazon Labor Union which won a vote in Staten Island New York last month criticized Graham for what he viewed as being more on the side of the employer than employees.

“It sounds like you were talking about more of the companies and the businesses in your speech but you forgot that the people are the ones who make these companies operate” Smalls said. “Yet we’re not protected and the process for when we hold these companies accountable is not working for us. And that’s the reason why we’re here today.”

Smalls argued that union protections and employee safety shouldn’t be a Democratic or a Republican issue but an issue that affects workers throughout the country.

He also rebuked Amazon for working against union organizers and for not meeting union representatives for the Staten Island warehouse at the bargaining table after employees voted to form a union.

“The corporations have the control … they break the law they get away with it” Smalls said.

Smalls met with Biden later in the day tweeting “he said I got him in trouble” before an emoji and “gooooooooooood.”

The meeting wasn’t on Biden’s public schedule. But Vice President Kamala Harris and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh were slated to hold a meeting at the White House Thursday afternoon with “grassroots worker organizers to discuss their extraordinary efforts to organize unions in their workplaces” according to Harris’ schedule.

Workers at a second Amazon warehouse in Staten Island rejected the union in a vote earlier this week.

Service Contract Act violators

Thomas Costa director of the Education Workforce and Income Security branch of the Government Accountability Office testified later in the hearing that 622 contractors with Service Contract Act violations were still able to get contracts with the federal government worth $35 billion.

That act addresses federal contractors with wage violations or misclassifying someone in a lower position and those that deny people so-called fringe benefits like paid leave or vacation time.

During the five-year period from fiscal 2014-2019 the U.S. Department of Labor looked at 5000 cases and found violations of the federal law in 68 percent of those cases. Employers in 94 percent of those cases complied with the law and paid back $204 million in back wages. A total of 60 were debarred meaning they couldn’t get federal contracts for three years.

Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine took an approach somewhere in between his two colleagues’ positions noting that officials and residents in the Northern Virginia suburbs just outside of Washington D.C. are excited for Amazon to bring 35000 jobs to the region with its new headquarters.

Not all of Amazon’s 1 million employees hate their jobs said Kaine a Democrat.

But he added that management and executives should exemplify the approach to working with unions that Kaine’s father had when he managed a union ironworkers shop.

“He just taught us growing up unions and management shouldn’t be fighting it should be a team” Kaine said adding he hopes managers and employees will aim “to be a team without owners kicking workers around and without employers being demonized.”

Kaine admonished management for how long it typically takes after employees vote to form a union for there to be a contract noting most unions cannot get a contract in the first three years “because the employer just stonewalls.”

Democrats have legislation known as the Pro Act that would overhaul how the unionization process works though the bill doesn’t have the necessary Republican support to get past the Senate’s legislative filibuster.

Sean O’Brien general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union told committee members that non-union companies tend to have a “significant competitive advantage” in securing federal contracts compared to companies with unions.

He testified that Amazon workers should have the chance to choose the type of union protections that other companies like UPS have.

“Amazon needs to be held accountable” O’Brien said. “And how you hold them accountable is taking back some of these contracts until they are a responsible employer.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL2hvbWUvc21hcnQtaG9tZS83LXN1cnByaXNpbmctYW1hem9uLWVjaG8tZmVhdHVyZXMteW91LWRpZG50LWtub3ctYWJvdXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Surprising Amazon Echo Features You Didn't Know About,"You use your Amazon Echo for all sorts of things around the house -- from playing music and replacing an old alarm clock to using it as a base for all your smart home devices. Or maybe you wanted it to make you laugh or you wanted more than one Echo speaker for whole-home audio. Whatever the case Alexa has so many other surprising features that you may not know about.

For example did you know you can turn your Echo into a TV speaker? Keep reading to learn how these surprising tips can be an asset to your day-to-day schedule.

You can stream sound from your TV to your Echo speaker

Instead of spending money on a new soundbar you can just stream sound to your Echo device from your TV. This is useful for when you'd like the sound to be louder (and closer) without waking up the entire house.

To do so you'll need to connect your Echo devices to a smart TV with Bluetooth capabilities or a Fire TV. Saying ""Alexa connect"" can help you get started. When you're ready to unpair the two just say ""Alexa disconnect.""

Echo can help you care for a loved one

If you've been worried about an older loved one during the pandemic Amazon now has a feature that gives you some ease of mind. It's called the Alexa Care Hub and it allows you to monitor their activity and receive alerts if they haven't been active for some time.

To start using the Care Hub open the Alexa app and tap More > See More > Care Hub. Select Get Started and follow the instructions. Your loved one will need to accept the request in their email and then set up a four-digit code to complete the setup.

Alexa can find your keys that always go missing

When you get home it's easy to just plop your keys down somewhere without thinking. However all that time spent searching for your keys can become tiresome. Fortunately you can use Alexa to help you find your keys when you're in a hurry. You'll need to attach an RFID device like a Tile tracker to your keychain and then pair it with Alexa.

Another option is to set your keys down somewhere and immediately activate your Echo to let it know where you've placed them. For example say ""Alexa remember that I placed my keys in the basket by the TV.""

Alexa can talk to your cats and dogs

Your pets get into everything so keep them entertained with your Amazon Echo. Alina Bradford/CNET

Worried about your furry best friends when you're at work all day? They're probably missing you too so why not have Alexa entertain them while you're gone? You'll need to download a skill in the Alexa app like Meow! for cat lovers and Woof! for dog lovers.

The way it works is Alexa acts as a virtual cat or dog and converses with your pet by meowing or barking. Alexa can start the ""conversation"" and once your pet responds the virtual assistant will continue mimicking the animal sounds. Just say ""Alexa enable Meow or Bark"" and your pets will be entertained all day.

If you prefer talking to your pets you can always use the drop-in feature to get your dog's tail wagging. You'll need to turn that function on in the Alexa app in the Communicate tab. Once it's enabled you can say ""Alexa drop in on the Echo Plus .""

Medication reminders



Much like the keys you always misplace Alexa can remind you to take your medication and which medication to take. You can set a reminder to say take your blood pressure medicine at 4 p.m. and Alexa will remind you. You can also tell Alexa that you took your medicine and if you later can't remember if you took it Alexa will let you know you already did.

Donate to a charity



If you'd like to give back to your community but you don't have time to volunteer you can always donate to the cause. To get started say ""Alexa I want to make a donation."" Alexa will ask which charity you want to donate to -- there are nearly 400 options. Alexa will ask how much you want to donate. Make sure you have Amazon Pay set up before you donate.

Hey Alexa what should I wear today? Tyler Lizenby/CNET

Alexa what should I wear today?

Not everyone has time to check the weather in the morning. If you're pressed for time ask Alexa if you should wear rain boots or sandals pants or shorts a jacket or T-shirt so you can get the wardrobe info that you need.

Start by saying ""Alexa what should I wear today?"" It will then give you the weather forecast and an outfit based on the weather. For example on a hot day Alexa may tell you to consider a white dress or gray shirt and linen shorts.

However if you also pay for a membership at Costco it’s to your advantage to comparison shop before you click the “Place Your Order” button on Amazon.

See: 6 Bad Habits That Hike Up Your Grocery Bill

While Costco doesn’t have the mind-blowing variety of items that Amazon does it does have competitive delivery options. You also might be surprised at how much you can save on daily-use items — savings that can add up month after month. To help you see the savings potential here are 11 items to buy at Costco instead of Amazon including current price comparisons.

Huggies Diapers

“Prices will range at both stores but a 180-count package of diapers at Amazon will run around $53 which is about 29 cents per diaper” said consumer analyst Julie Ramhold with DealNews. “That’s not terrible but you can get a pack of 192 Huggies diapers from Costco for around $45 which is about 24 cents per diaper. When you’re having to buy a ton of these items that 4-5 cents savings per diaper can really add up; plus you’re getting more in one package which should help to reduce how often you have to buy them when you shop at Costco.”

Alive! Women’s Multi-Vitamin

At Costco you can purchase a bottle of 200 tablets for $22.97 or 12 cents per tablet. However the catch is that the price is only available if you purchase the item at Costco.com so you won’t be able to pick up the item on your regular Costco runs.

But when you compare the Costco price to what you’ll pay for the item at Amazon — only 130 tablets for $24.67 or almost 19 cents per pill — it’s a no-brainer to buy a larger quantity of these multi-vitamins at a lower price from Costco.

Baby Wipes

“This is another thing that new parents will likely be buying a lot of and if you shop at Amazon you can expect to find packages of around 336 wipes for about $12” Ramhold said.

“That’s about 4 cents per wipe which definitely isn’t bad. But if you shop at Costco you can find boxes of 900 wipes for around $22 — that’s about 2 cents per wipe. In addition to those savings you’re also buying a large amount and as with the diapers it helps to reduce the amount of times you have to purchase them.”

Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Microwavable Cups 12-Count

You’ll pay a premium to get these mac-and-cheese cups from Amazon — $19.23 for 12 cups which equals $1.60 per cup. However if you opt to buy them at Costco you’ll pay just $11.09 for the same item which equals 93 cents per cup and a savings of $8.14 overall.

Story continues

Note that this is an online-only item at Costco that’s eligible for two-day delivery so if you don’t order at least $75 worth of two-day delivery items you’ll pay an additional $3 delivery fee which will bring your total to $15.09. Still you’ll save over $5 on this item at Costco as compared to purchasing from Amazon.

Charmin Toilet Paper

“At Amazon you can expect to pay around $33 for 24 rolls but at Costco you can buy a pack of 30 rolls for around $31” said Ramhold. “While the outright savings don’t seem like that much — especially if you get free shipping via a Prime membership — the price per roll works out to be much better at Costco. You’ll pay $1.03 per roll at the warehouse club versus $1.38 per roll (or more) at Amazon.”

K. Bell No-Show Sock

You can get 20 pairs of K. Bell No-Show Socks for $19.99 at Costco. Plus Costco’s website states that you might be able to get these socks at an even lower price in your local warehouse. At Amazon however the pack only contains nine pairs of socks and you’ll pay $2.44 per pair — over double the cost you’ll pay at Costco.

Dixie Ultra Paper Plates

“If you prefer to use paper plates whether for crafts or meals Costco is the way to go” Ramhold said. “At Amazon a 172-count package of the Dixie Ultra plates will cost around $36 which is about 21 cents per plate. But at Costco you can get a package of 186 for $24 which is a much more affordable 13 cents per plate. Getting more for less makes this a no-brainer. These are specifically the 10 1/6 inch plates but you can also buy 8 1/2 inch Dixie Ultra plates at Costco for an even better deal — $25 for 285 plates or about 9 cents per plate.”

San Francisco Bay French Roast Coffee Pods

“Sure Amazon offers more flavors overall and you can get a 120-count box of the pods there for around $50 but that comes out to about 42 cents per cup” said Ramhold. “At Costco you’ll be restricted to a 100-count box but it’ll only set you back $36 or 36 cents per cup. And if you wait for them to go on sale at Costco you’ll get an even better deal — prices can drop to $30 or less when they’re on sale at the warehouse club which means you can get this excellent coffee for about 31 cents a cup or less depending on the sale.”

Skippy Peanut Butter

If you or someone in your family is a peanut butter fan Costco has two 48-ounce jars of Skippy SuperChunk Peanut Butter for $10.49 which is about $5.24 per jar. At Amazon you’ll pay $11.98 or almost $1.50 more if you order the same two-pack.

Tide Pods

If Tide Pods are your go-to laundry solution Costco definitely has a better deal. You can get 168 HE Laundry Detergent Pods in Spring Meadow scent for $35.49 which equals 21 cents per pod. At Amazon you’ll pay $21.24 for 81 pods which is around 26 cents per pod or a 5-cent savings per laundry load.

Quaker Instant Oatmeal

“Costco only has a couple of varieties available — Fruit & Cream or another variety pack — but they’re both much better at the warehouse club than what you’ll find at Amazon” said Ramhold.

“The online retailer offers a 44-pack box of the Fruit & Cream variety pack for around $16 which works out to 36 cents per pack. At Costco the same variety is $10.49 although that’s for a 40 count box; still that comes to 26 cents per pack which beats Amazon. If you prefer the other variety pack — with classic flavors like apples & cinnamon maple & brown sugar and cinnamon & spice — Costco will cost you $14.49 for 52 packs or about 28 cents per pack. At Amazon the exact same product will cost you around $15 or 29 cents per pack.”

That’s why Amazon is thrilled to be able to invest in the health and well-being of young people in Boston and beyond” said Jerome Smith Amazon’s Head of Community Engagement for New England. “The pandemic took so much from all of us especially young people. We hope this donation will get young athletes back in the game.”

The company made the announcement at the South End Baseball’s Opening Day Parade and festivities. Amazon is investing in eight communities across the Commonwealth. The resources from Amazon come as many local youth sports organizations throughout the nation are struggling to recover from the economic effects of the pandemic. Survey data from last year suggests the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on youth sports participation. National research by the Aspen Institute found thirteen percent of youth sports parents said their community-based sports provider closed due to COVID-19 and another 12% noted it had merged with another organization. In total 44% of families said their community-based program has either closed merged or returned with limited capacity.

“South End Baseball is incredibly grateful for the support being given to us from Amazon with this year’s and last year’s grants” said Pete Shults president of SEB’s board of directors and a longtime coach. “With the pandemic essentially shutting down our fundraising efforts over the last two years the company’s generosity is making a world of difference in our ability to keep the league’s operations running and funding our Hugh Chambers/Paul Rinkulis college scholarship program which helps deserving players pursue their educational goals.”

“All Dorchester Sports and Leadership takes our mission of fostering healthy lifestyles and leadership skills very seriously. As we emerge from the past two years of near isolation we recognize that participating in team sports helps address the stress our youth have been experiencing” said Candice Gartley Executive Director of All Dorchester Sports & Leadership. “Active bodies go hand in hand with good mental health. The generous support that Amazon provides ADSL allows us to work to re-engage our youth in healthy athletic activities.”

“To say this support from Amazon is game-changing is an understatement. This investment is just the spark needed after being sidelined by the pandemic to ensure sports in Lawrence come back with better quality opportunities that reach more deserving kids” said Stephanie McArdle Executive Director of Beyond Soccer & Beyond Volley. “In addition to helping Beyond Soccer and Beyond Volley advance its mission providing affordable year-round sports and recreational programs to thousands of kids Amazon’s impact will be magnified through its simultaneous investment in the Lawrence Sports Alliance and the dozens of Lawrence sports groups involved like Suenos Basketball Lawrence Pop Warner and Serving Stars who like Amazon believe in the power of sports to strengthen communities and make sure young people reap sports’ awesome life-long benefits.”

“On behalf of the Revere Youth Baseball and Softball League it is a pleasure to thank Amazon for their generous donation to our league” said Shawn Vetere coach and board member of Revere Youth Baseball and Softball. “It has been a struggle to operate the league since early 2020 without the benefit of being able to fundraise because of the then COVID-19 Restrictions. The funds you are donating will help our league to operate under normal conditions once again. These funds will also enable us to provide better equipment and uniforms for the children. Additionally the funds will help fund the two new batting cages we will be installing at our complex.”

“Milford Youth Baseball would like to extend a sincere thank you to Amazon for their generous donation” said Paul Pellegrini President Milford Youth Baseball. “Amazon’s continued commitment to the Milford Community is evident through this donation which will assist in the renovation of the Rosenfeld Field Project. This grant will also allow Milford Youth Baseball to purchase much needed equipment which in turns defrays the costs associated with participation. Youth sports is an integral part of developing key skills such as healthy physical activity personal relationships teamwork competition and building confidence. These skills are building blocks for the future. We are grateful that Amazon has decided to support our league as a part of their significant investment in the youth of New England.”

“As our state turns the corner on the pandemic we need to ensure our young people have access to equitable affordable and local recreational activities” Smith added. “Investing in these programs is an investment in our youth and in helping them lead healthier happier lives.”

Over the last year Amazon has supported local communities across the Commonwealth through monetary and in-kind donations to nonprofit organizations and public schools. Some examples include donations to King Boston The Greater Boston Food Bank The United Way of Massachusetts Bay and Merrimack Valley local chapters of the Boys & Girls Club local public schools and other area nonprofits. Last spring Amazon announced a donation of one million dollars to the arts and cultural institutions in and around Boston. There are also more than 28000 organizations in Massachusetts that Amazon customers can support simply by shopping on Amazon smile. As of the fourth quarter of 2021 the company was employing more than 21000 full- and part-time employees across its Massachusetts operations and is continuing to hire.

He assumed it was the regular delivery boat bringing gasoline for generators and outboard motors to remote settlements like his. Instead what Kuruaya found was a barge dredging his people’s pristine river in search of gold.

Kuruaya had never seen a dredge operating in this area of the Xipaia people’s territory let alone one this massive; it resembled a floating factory.

Kuruaya 47 motored out to the barge boarded it and confronted the gold miners. They responded in harsh voices and he retreated for fear they were armed. But so was he — with a phone — the first he’d ever had. Back in his village Karimaa his son Thaylewa Xipaia forwarded the photos of the mining boat to the tribe’s WhatsApp chat groups.

“Guys this is urgent!” he said to fellow members of his tribe in an audio message The Associated Press has reviewed. “There’s a barge here at Pigeons Island. It’s huge and it’s destroying the whole island. My dad just went there and they almost took his phone.”

Several days’ voyage away in the nearest city of Altamira Kuruaya’s daugher Juma Xipaia received the frantic messages. She recorded her own video with choked voice and watery eyes warning that armed conflict was imminent -- then uploaded it to social media.

In a matter of hours word was out to the world.

The episode illustrates the advance of the internet into vast remote rainforest areas that until recently had no means of quickly sharing visual evidence of environmental crime. A fast-expanding network of antennae is empowering Indigenous groups to use phones video cameras and social media to galvanize the public and pressure authorities to respond swiftly to threats from gold miners landgrabbers and loggers.

Until now Indigenous communities have relied on radio to transmit their distress calls. Environmental and Indigenous rights groups then relayed these to the media and the public. But the non-profits have been maligned by Brazil’s far-right President Jair Bolsonaro who advocates legalizing mining and land leasing in protected Indigenous territories. He has castigated the organizations as unreliable actors out of touch with Indigenous people’s true desires and on the payroll of global environmental do-gooders.

Video and photos coming directly from Indigenous people are harder to dismiss and this is forcing authorities as well as the public to reckon with the reality on the ground.

“When used properly technology helps a lot in real-time monitoring and denouncing” said Nara Baré head of the group Coordination of Indigenous Organizations of the Brazilian Amazon in a telephone interview. “The external pressure to make the federal government act in the Xipaia territory was very important. Technology has been the main tool for that.”

Connectivity is not only enabling whistle-blowing on social media. Brazil’s Federal Prosecutor’s Office has set up a website to register reported crimes and receive uploaded visual material. Previously people in remote communities have had to make the long and expensive trip to the nearest city that has a federal prosecutor’s office.

Xipaia territory is part of a pristine rainforest area known as Terra do Meio (Middle Earth) that is dotted with dozens of Indigenous and traditional river communities. Internet connection there was rare until mid-2020 when a group of non-profits including Health in Harmony and the Socio-Environmental Institute financed installation of 17 antennae throughout the vast region.

Priority was given to communities with either health centers or market hubs for the production and sale of forest products such as Brazil nuts. Signal can be painfully slow especially on rainy days yet it has connected people who were previously off the grid and is enough for photos and videos to trickle out of the forest.

“The strategy was to improve communication and avoid unnecessary trips to the city” said Marcelo Salazar Health in Harmony’s Brazil program coordinator. “The internet makes it easier for health education and forest economy issues.” Fighting environmental crime was an added benefit he added.

Four out of five Xipaia communities are now connected. Karimaa the village where the barge was first spotted has had internet since July 2020. Just three days after installation when a teenager injured his head a city doctor was able to assess his condition using photos sent over WhatsApp. That avoided a costly complicated medevac during the COVID-19 pandemic.

But the case of the mining dredge marked the first time the Xipaia used the internet to protect their territory. In addition to sounding the alarm four villages used WhatsApp to quickly organize a party of warriors to confront the miners. Painted with urucum a local fruit that produces a red ink and armed with bows arrows and hunting rifles they crammed into a small boat according to Juma Xipaia. By the time they reached the location where the barge had been however it was gone.

Some 1300 kilometers (800 miles) to the west in the Amazonian state of Rondonia internet access enabled the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau people to take classes in photography and video online so they could chronicle deforestation by landgrabbers. The three-day training in 2020 was held via Zoom.

That effort produced the documentary “The Territory” which won awards at this year’s Sundance Film Festival Copenhagen International Documentary Film Festival and others. Throughout its production American director Alex Pritz relied on WhatsApp to communicate with his newly trained camera operators.

Tangaãi Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau is a teacher-turned-cameraman who traveled to the Danish festival and later spoke with the AP via WhatsApp from his remote village. He said the film is changing people’s perception of Brazil’s indigenous people. “In Copenhagen... I received many questions. They knew about Brazil’s natural wonders but didn’t know about Indigenous peoples who fight for their territories.”

Elsewhere in the Amazon the internet has yet to arrive. So when illegal gold miners killed two Yanomami tribe members in June 2020 news of the crime took two weeks to arrive due to the area’s remoteness. To avoid a repeat of that Yanomami organizations have been seeking better connectivity. After Palimiu village along the Uraricoera River suffered a series of attacks committed by miners in May 2021 the Yanomami managed to install an antenna there. Since then the violence has eased.

Bolsonaro’s repeated promises to legalize mining and other activities on Indigenous lands have fueled invasions of territories which are often islands of forest amid sprawling ranches. Indigenous and environmental groups estimate there are some 20000 illegal miners in Yanomami territory which is roughly the size of Portugal. Bolsonaro’s government claims that there are 3500.

Deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon surged 76% in 2021 compared to 2018 the year before Bolsonaro took office according to official data from Brazil’s space agency which uses satellites to monitor forest loss.

Most internet connections in the Amazon remain slow even in mid-sized cities. That may soon change. Last November Brazil’s Communications Minister Fábio Faria held a meeting with billionaire Elon Musk to discuss a partnership to improve connectivity in rural areas of the world’s largest tropical rainforest.

The communications ministry however says the talks have not evolved and no progress has been made. Musk’s company SpaceX did not respond to emailed requests for comment.

Some worry that Indigenous groups like the Xipaia won’t be the only beneficiaries of greater internet penetration in the Amazon region. Illegal miners often co-opt local Indigenous leaders communicating surreptitiously on messaging apps. The conversations sometimes aided by clandestine networks can enable miners to hide heavy machinery or tip them off to impending raids by authorities allowing them to flee.

In Roraima state which is where most of the Yanomami territory lies the AP contacted one internet provider that offers wifi to an illegal gold mine for $2600 plus $690 per month. Clandestine small craft fly the equipment in for installation.

“It’s a double-edged sword” said Salazar of Health in Harmony speaking of increased connectivity.

But for Juma Xipaia the new connection means added protection and visibility for her people. After she posted her tearful video it racked up views and was picked up by local and international media. Within two days an airborne operation involving the Federal Police the national guard and environmental agencies swooped in. They located the dredge hidden behind vegetation on the banks of the Iriri River with seven miners aboard.

In a country where environmental crime in the Amazon usually goes unchecked the speedy successful response underscored the power of Indigenous networks.

“After making a lot of calls for help I decided to do the video. Then it worked. The telephone didn’t stop ringing” Juma Xipaia said by phone. “It was very fast after the video.”

Our return trip was on Air France. I booked (3) seats Paris – Houston for 66500 Air France KLM Flying Blue miles + $383.17 apiece.

These were miles I already had sitting in my account from a cancelled trip Austin – Amsterdam roundtrip at the start of the pandemic. Originally I’d booked BA Paris – London – Austin. I like the idea of the long overwater flight originating and ending in my home city. But a couple of schedule changes left me with a 5 hour layover at Heathrow and no good way to improve on that. With a 3 year old in tow I decided that was a non-starter.

May I begin by mentioning how much I hate Charles de Gaulle airport? It’s far from the city and even without traffic is a schlepp. But getting through the airport was time-consuming too. First we queued in the Sky Priority check-in area to show proof of negative Covid-19 test (or prior infection). Then we were allowed to queue for baggage drop off.

Both of these took some time so that even though we’d arrived at the airport more than two hours in advance by the time we made it by train to our remote concourse and had cleared passport control and security our flight was set to board in just 10 minutes. And we’d still have to deposit our Covid-19 attestation in the gate before boarding.

Still we made a brief stop in the lounge for a bathroom break before continuing to the gate.





Air France business class uses the same seats as Cathay Pacific and as American Airlines on its Boeing 777-300ER. This isn’t a new seat by any stretch but it’s still a very good one.

The seat dates back 14 years to its first install on US Airways Airbus A330s. The Cirrus seat then was produced by Sicma then Zodiac and eventual Safran. For an airline that’s generally stylish though I find the color scheme to be fairly sterile in the Air France cabin.

Still they’re fully flat seats with direct aisle access and for a time this was probably the best business class across the Atlantic. I prefer it over United’s Polaris seat and indeed over any Star Alliance business class across the Pond.







Waiting at my seat was a blanket and a pillow. The pillow was fine but the blanket not nearly as good as the one provided by British Airways and there was no mattress pad. To be sure it was a day time flight but one that lasted 11 hours.

There was also a Covid Kit with medical-style mask and other items inside. Air France requests these masks or better and avoids use of cloth masks.

I appreciate a pen in an amenity kit for filling out forms though for US flights I don’t need to do that. Still it should definitely be a standard until the world goes all-electronic and Air France flies to many destinations that are not. Here’s the amenity kit:





Before takeoff I decided to change into pajamas. On my overnight BA flight from Austin to London I wore a pair of American Airlines pajamas. For this flight I brought out a pair of United Polaris pajamas. On overnights and day flights over 8 hours I definitely want to get comfortable and the pair of jeans and button shirt I’d worn to the airport weren’t going to cut it.

Where Air France stands out most I think besides the basic seat is in its catering. It’s certainly possible to provide a nice multi-course meal in business class and other airlines should take lessons.

Here’s the menu for the flight:

After takeoff which was delayed by about half an hour for baggage loading drinks were served along with a box of packaged nuts. The nuts were rather plain heated or not. Fine but a lost opportunity for something more interesting.

The actual meal service though is an area where Air France shines. First it was served in proper courses – a tray with salad and appetizer followed by an entree and then dessert. The shrimp appetizer was fantastic. I had the beef for me main and it was quite good. The cheese was fine (maybe my standards were too high after spending time in Paris) but I really enjoyed the selection of treats and sorbets afterward.

Now I wasn’t nearly as impressed by the midflight snacks. There was a bar service setup in the galley and self-service chocolates and chips neither of which were especially to my taste. They would make a hot sandwich for you however of meat and cheese. It was fine and nice to have on an 11 hour flight but something you could definitely give a miss and not regret.

Maybe I was most impressed by the second meal service not because it was better than the main meal (it wasn’t) but because it’s so much better than I expect for a second meal which is usually quite bad on U.S. airlines.

the cod dish was downright delicious a comfort food that perfectly hit the spot and a nice cake for dessert as well.

Flight attendants were both friendly and efficient throughout always available and I was proud of my three year old daughter who ate food watched shows played games and never got fussy at all on the journey.

When we flew home from Houston to Austin on United though after two long haul business class flights in a week we boarded the regional jet and she asked where her bed was?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hbG9oYS1oYXdhaWktdGhlLWJlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtc2VydmluZy10aGUtcGFjaWZpYy1wYXJhZGlzZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aloha Hawaii: The Best Airlines Serving The Pacific Paradise,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9hbG9oYS1oYXdhaWktdGhlLWJlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtc2VydmluZy10aGUtcGFjaWZpYy1wYXJhZGlzZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9sdWZ0aGFuc2EtdnVlbGluZy1hZGQtZmxpZ2h0cy10by1hY2NvbW1vZGF0ZS1mb290YmFsbC1mYW5zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,European Finals: Lufthansa & Vueling Add Special Flights To Accommodate Football Fans,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9sdWZ0aGFuc2EtdnVlbGluZy1hZGQtZmxpZ2h0cy10by1hY2NvbW1vZGF0ZS1mb290YmFsbC1mYW5zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Sometimes Mother Nature and modern technology just don't mix -- especially when it comes to the nation's power grids.

Gusty winds knock down power lines and spark wildfires. Vegetation surrounding the substations catch fire. Severe winter storms cause mayhem at substations bringing freezing conditions to regions with infrastructure not built to withstand frigid temperatures. And these threats are expected to worsen as the number of severe weather events continue to climb due to climate change.

But the risks posed by nature don't end with natural disasters. Wildlife also poses a significant threat to power grids experts told ABC News.

""Animals also play a role in the reliability of the overall power system"" Drew McGuire the director of substations distribution and environment research at the Electric Power Research Institute a non-profit energy research and development organization told ABC News. ""We typically see this in distribution in the lower voltages that you would typically see in neighborhoods and things like that in in substations.""

One of the biggest ways animals disrupt the flow of electricity to households is by breaking into electrical substations Luis Puigcerver a senior product manager for wildlife and asset protection at TE Connectivity a technology company that designs and manufactures connectors and sensors told ABC News.

Once critters such as squirrels rats raccoons and even snakes get into the substation all they have to do is touch two pieces of bare metal to conduct a surge Puigcerver said. Just the slightest touch could cause a flashover which is involves electricity running through the animal from one electrical bare connection to another or to a grounded position he added.

""They're sitting on a piece of metal that that's either grounded or electrified and then they touch their pop of their nose"" Puigcerver said. ""And sometimes they don't even have to touch and get very close to it and it'll bridge the gap -- literally cause that electricity to jump from the metal through the body of the creature and then short itself out.""

What results is a small explosion that leaves the animal burned electrocuted and causes damage to the substation and outages to sometimes thousands of households Puigcerver said. Sometimes the animal can even catch fire he said.

""It could be catastrophic"" he said. ""In some areas I've seen a small little 12-inch squirrel blow up a $2 million-plus transformer.""'

Birds especially birds of prey with large wingspans pose the second more significant threat to power grids Alex Mackewich Power Line Sentry a company that designs power protection solutions to prevent power outages and wildlife deaths told ABC News.

Power poles in the U.S. typically are made with wooden poles and three wires as conductors. While it's a common sight to see flocks of smaller birds sitting safely on one wire the danger is present when the birds are able to touch two different charges as once.

Squirrels and sometimes snakes can also climb onto the wires and cause this damage but in North America birds are typically the culprits Puigcerver said. Bald eagles especially love to perch on top of the poles to hunt for prey but when it takes off with its 6-foot wingspan and touches multiple bare wires that electric surge will then flow right through it he said.

Then if it falls to the ground onto dry vegetation it could spark a wildfire Mackewich said.

Animals have proven problematic in the past.

In March a bird that flew into an electrical substation was blamed for taking out power for nearly 10000 customers in New Orleans.

A slug was blamed for cutting power for nearly 10000 riders of two dozen high-speed trains in Japan in 2019. A weasel was the cause of a similar shutdown of Europe's Large Hadron Collider in 2016.

Squirrels which have been such a problem in the past that the American Public Power Association tracks squirrel-caused blackouts with its Squirrel Index are thought to be more dangerous to power grids than Russian hackers. In 1987 a stray squirrel was blamed for shutting down the NASDAQ for 82 minutes thwarting the trade of an estimated 20 million shares.

The data about the number of outages in the past caused by wildlife is likely underrepresented as technology advances and tracking methods improve Mackewich said.

Sometimes turning the power back on is as simple as resetting some of the lines so the power can be redirected. Other times customers can be without power for hours or even days as crews work to repair the damage Puigcerver said.

Officials will need to ensure the infrastructure is sound as the world begins to rely less on fossil fuels and more on electricity Mackewich said. Most of the structures in the U.S. are at least 50 years old and there are many that are more than 100 years old she said. Power grids are not only subject to a demand they likely were not built for but climate change continues to threaten the grids.

The ultimate ""failsafe"" is to create underground lines that are protected from the elements Puigcerver said. But burying the power lines underground is expensive and requires extensive planning around the topography of the land.

Utility companies spend a lot of time thinking about how to mitigate potential impacts and how to do so in a cost-effective way McGuire said.

Three types of technology are used to prevent outages he said. Insulation products covers that companies would use to cover power lines and transformer metal connectors act to prevent an animal such as a squirrel or a bird from making contact with an energized component. Isolation products something like a fence or spikes are installed to prevent birds from perching and discs are used in similar ways at substations. And hazing products products that are meant to discourage animals from from entering the general area include flight diverters or a plastic owl and in some cases noise machines McGuire said.

TE Connectivity has created plastic materials designed to withstand the rigors of pollution ultraviolet rays and electrical activity some which cover critical areas such as bare wires and transformer metal connectors to prevent accidents on power lines and substations Puigcerver said.

""And that's why these devices that you put up from a maintenance standpoint and from a reliability standpoint come into play afterwards"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2J1c2luZXNzLWVudmlyb25tZW50LXVuaXRlZC1zdGF0ZXMtZ2VvcmdpYS1hdGxhbnRhLTc1NTVmOGQ3M2M0NmYwZTU1MTNjMTVkMzkxNDA5YWEz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Georgia nuclear plant's cost now forecast to top $30 billion,"ATLANTA (AP) — A nuclear power plant being built in Georgia is now projected to cost its owners more than $30 billion.

A financial report from one of the owners on Friday clearly pushed the cost of Plant Vogtle near Augusta past that milestone bringing its total cost to $30.34 billion

That amount doesn’t count the $3.68 billion that original contractor Westinghouse paid to the owners after going bankrupt which would bring total spending to more than $34 billion.

Vogtle is the only nuclear plant under construction in the United States and its costs could deter other utilities from building such plants even though they generate electricity without releasing climate-changing carbon emissions.

The latest increase in the budget by the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia wasn’t a surprise after lead owner Georgia Power Co. announced delays and $920 million in overruns on March 3. Georgia Power’s costs only cover the 45.7% of the plant it owns meaning that the cooperatives and municipal utilities that own the majority of the two-reactor project later update their financial projections as well.

MEAG which owns 22.7% of Vogtle and provides power to city-owned utilities raised its total cost forecast including capital spending and borrowing costs to $7.8 billion from the previous level of $7.5 billion.

Oglethorpe Power Corp. which provides power to 38 cooperatives in Georgia owns 30% of Vogtle. In March bumped up its cost projects by $250 million to $8.5 billion.

The city of Dalton which owns 1.6% estimated its cost at $240 million in 2021. It hasn’t released a public update.

The municipal utility in Jacksonville Florida as well as some other municipal utilities and cooperatives in Florida and Alabama are obligated to buy power from the plant.

When approved in 2012 the third and fourth reactors were estimated to cost $14 billion with the first electricity being generated in 2016. Now the third reactor is set to begin operation in March 2023 and the fourth reactor is set to begin operation in December 2023.

Atlanta-based Southern Co. which owns Georgia Power has been charging increasing shares of its cost overruns as shareholder losses saying it’s unlikely that the Georgia Public Service Commission will approve adding amounts to the bills of Georgia Power’s 2.6 million customers. But Oglethorpe MEAG and Dalton don’t have shareholders meaning customers are fully exposed to overruns.

Georgia Power’s customers as well as some Oglethorpe customers are already paying the costs of Vogtle.

To protect themselves the other owners signed an agreement with Georgia Power in 2018 specifying that if costs reach a certain point the other owners can choose to freeze their costs at that level. In exchange for paying more of the costs Georgia Power would own a larger share of the reactors.

Oglethorpe wants to freeze its costs at $8.1 billion selling 2% of the reactor to Georgia Power in exchange for Georgia Power paying $400 million more in costs. MEAG also said Friday it wants to freeze its costs but didn’t say how much it sought to shift to Georgia Power.

Southern has acknowledged it will have to pay at least $440 million more to cover what would have been other owners’ costs and has said another $460 million is in dispute.

Georgia Power is disputing the cost threshold at which it must shoulder more of the burden and saying it shouldn’t have to pay the other owners’ share of extra costs stemming from COVID-19. The owners are in talks aimed at resolving their disagreements.

“Cost sharing is imminent however until the parties reach agreement Oglethorpe will continue to pay its full share of the construction costs as billed by Georgia Power but will do so under contractual protest” Oglethorpe CEO Mike Smith said in March.

All the owners did vote to continue construction on Feb. 25. Also the owners report that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission in March completed a follow-up inspection of wiring problems at the third reactor and signed off that problems it identified in November had been fixed returning the reactor to its less intensive baseline inspection regime.

It’s a Priority Pass restaurant so if you have your Priority Pass card from Chase Citibank or Capital One you get a $28 credit there ($56 for two people).

Bobby Van’s is one of the better airport restaurants in the Priority Pass program. While you’re supposed to have a same day boarding pass to enter that still lets you eat there both on arrival in New York and on departure as well.

In my experience they don’t actually check boarding passes just swipe your card. If I were an American Airlines crewmember based in New York I’d definitely get a credit card that offers unlimited Priority Pass visits (not from American Express which doesn’t cover restaurant visits).

Since the American Airlines terminal is underutilized throughout much of the day Bobby Van’s is quiet. Eventually British Airways will move in the terminal will pick up a bit and of course the terminal’s concessions program is turning over. But for now there’s a vast restaurant with staff just waiting for you to swipe your Priority Pass card. Everyone that was there during my most recent visit had one.

Some people do order steaks here. I’ve had the tuna burger and I’ve had the chili (which is excellent) and several other items. They may have the best airport restaurant burger you can buy in the United States. It’s actually delicious – from a nicely cooked piece of beef to excellent bun. And it’s even better when the basic burger is $25 on the menu plus tax meaning you’re really just going to pay for the tip and anything else you might add or drink.

If you have enough time to kill it’s certainly better to have a meal at Spicy Lanka in Jamaica near the airport.

Sample flights

We found flights in September from New York City (JFK) to Cairo (CAI) on Royal Air Maroc for only $567 round-trip. This fare does include a long layover during the outbound flight in Casablanca so be aware of that before you book. In fact most of the best prices out of New York City to Egypt we found included a long layover.

On the plus side Royal Air Maroc a Oneworld member allows passengers to check up to two bags and bring a small carry-on.

The same NYC-Cairo route in January on Royal Air Maroc is a bit more expensive but has a much more reasonable layover.

We found a few truly spectacular deals out of Chicago. This itinerary from O'Hare International Airport (ORD) to Cairo in late September on Air Canada is only $575 round-trip. That's more than $600 less than what you would normally expect to pay for this route. It does have an 18-hour layover in Montreal on the return flight but that's a great city to find yourself with a day to enjoy. Also Air Canada's Standard fare comes with a free carry-on and your first checked bag is free.

If you prefer to visit the Pyramids in December we found this epic deal from Swiss Air Lines from O'Hare to Cairo for only $608 round-trip. The layovers in Zurich aren't quite as bad on this route and the savings are incredible. And like the Air Canada ticket we mentioned earlier this Swiss itinerary comes with a free carry-on and your first checked bag for free.

September and October are the months to fly to Egypt if you live in Texas. We found great availability in those months.

You can book a ticket through Delta to fly from Dallas (DFW) to Cairo for $644 round-trip a really nice discount from normal prices. This fare comes with a free carry-on and two free checked bags.

The same route is available at the same great price in January too.

We didn't forget about Oakland. You can save a lot of money on flights from Oakland International Airport (OAK) to Cairo. We found some fares in December and January that are more than 50% off normal prices. The caveat is that the discounted flights all had two stops. Here's one example on Delta we liked that comes with a free carry-on and two free checked bags.

It’s been nearly four years since China put tariffs on American-grown soybeans during a tit-for-tat trade war with then-President Donald Trump – and they remain in place despite the change in administrations.

President Joe Biden has chosen to leave US tariffs imposed by his predecessor in 2018 in place on $350 billion in Chinese goods. In turn Beijing has left its retaliatory tariffs on some agricultural products including soybeans and some American-made goods.

The Chinese tariffs hurt US farmers by making American-grown soybeans more expensive for Chinese buyers who bought a majority of US exports prior to the trade war.

“We’ve lived with tariffs for so long it’s just the way we do business now” said Iowa farmer Dave Walton who saw prices for his soybeans plummet after the tariffs were put in place in 2018.

His farm is near the Mississippi River where his soybeans are usually loaded onto a barge and then sent overseas after reaching the Gulf of Mexico. This location made it easy to export his crop.

But this year Walton is trying to rely less on foreign buyers. Instead of exporting his soybeans he is selling them to a domestic company that will use the crop for seed.

Walton remains frustrated with the Biden administration for leaving US tariffs in place. If trade tensions eased Beijing may lift the tariffs on US soybeans too. He’s also frustrated that the administration has so far failed to successfully appoint people to two key agricultural trade positions: The chief agricultural negotiator role at the Office of the US Trade Representative and the undersecretary for foreign trade position at the US Department of Agriculture remain open.

“It signals to me that trade is not a priority for the administration. If it was a priority for them they’d have those trade positions filled and they’d be working on updating trade agreements with China and other countries” he said.

Biden leaves tariffs in place

Earlier this month the Biden administration took a first step toward conducting a statutory four-year review of the US tariffs on Chinese goods – but officials have given no indication that the review will result in removing the tariffs.

So far the Biden administration has resisted the pressure from the American business community to lift the tariffs which has ramped up as inflation increases. In an interview last Monday at the Milken Institute Global Conference US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said all tools are on the table to address inflation but stopped short of saying whether lifting tariffs should be one of them.

In 2020 a truce was reached between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Both sides stopped adding new tariffs as part of what’s known as the Phase One deal. Beijing also agreed to increase its purchases of US goods and agricultural products.

But China fell well short of its goal buying only 57% of the US exports it had committed to purchasing by the end of 2021. While agricultural exports to China returned to 2017 levels they fell short of China’s commitment. Soybean exports fell more than 30% short of the target.

Biden suggested earlier this year that China’s failure to meet its commitments is the reason he’s leaving the tariffs in place.

“It’s uncertain” the President said in January when asked if it’s time to begin lifting some of the tariffs.

“I’d like to be able to be in a position where I can say they’re meeting the commitments or more of their commitments and be able to lift some of it. But we’re not there yet” he added.

Impact on US soybeans

US exports of soybeans declined sharply immediately after China put the tariffs in place in 2018. Soybeans lost more than 75% of their export value to China between 2018 and 2019 according to a report from the USDA.

But soybean sales to China have nearly rebounded to their pre-trade-war levels. Soybean exports to China were just 1% lower in the year after the Phase One deal had been signed than they were in 2017 the USDA report found.

Still it’s hard to know what would have happened without the tariffs in place.

“The overall impact the tariffs have had on trade is a much harder thing to sort through ever since the ceasefire” said Joseph Glauber a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute and former chief economist at the USDA.

Still he thinks it’s a “no-brainer” for the US to lift the tariffs. “It would help normalize trade” Glauber added.

Some farmers fear they may have permanently lost some of their Chinese buyers who turned to other countries for soybeans over the last four years.

As US exports to China increased after the Phase One agreement was reached exports from other countries grew at even faster. As a result the US market share of China’s agricultural imports is now smaller than it was before the trade war: 17% in approximately the first year of Phase One compared with 20% in calendar year 2017 according to the USDA.

There are non-tariff barriers to trade imposed by China as well. Commercial Chinese buyers need government approval to import US soybeans.

“Importers in China have to jump through hoops to get access to US soybeans. There’s clearly a cost to doing business” Glauber said.

But trade issues have taken a back seat to other more pressing worries for farmers according to the Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer. In April 42% of producers said higher input costs are their top concern.

While Walton remains frustrated with the Biden administration’s lack of action on trade he also said he is worried about rising costs especially for herbicide.

“I’ve seen some instances where the price of herbicide has doubled or tripled. … We didn’t get our first choice but we finally got an herbicide we can use to protect our crop” Walton said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vMjMwNTY1MzAvYWlkLWFjY2Vzcy1hYm9ydGlvbi1yb2Utd2FkZS1waWxscy1taWZlcHJpc3RvbmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This European nonprofit provides abortion pills to women in states where US doctors can’t,"In 2018 more than two decades after Dutch physician Rebecca Gomperts first became an activist to deliver abortion pills around the world she turned to the United States. For years she had dedicated her life to working in countries where the procedure was illegal and was firm in her refusal to avoid the US where safe legalized access was still available. “I think this is a problem the US has to solve itself” she explained in 2014.

But following the election of President Donald Trump the desperate requests she received from Americans went up and the cost barriers in the US were glaring.

So Gomperts launched a new nonprofit organization based in Austria — Aid Access — with the goal of providing affordable and accessible abortion services to people in the US.

Over the past four years Aid Access says it has delivered abortion medication — mifepristone and misoprostol — to more than 30000 Americans across all 50 states including the 19 conservative states that currently ban telemedicine abortion.

The organization plays a unique role in the US reproductive rights ecosystem by successfully exploiting legal loopholes that make it easier for an overseas doctor to care for American patients in restrictive states — a role that could become even more key if Roe v. Wade is struck down.

If the right to an abortion does get overturned Aid Access staff say they feel confident their services could continue in the same way they’ve been able to operate in red states that have barred other abortion groups.

So what’s the catch?

For now the biggest one may be the big tech platforms. Aid Access needs to spread awareness about its services and quickly. The pills when shipped from overseas can take two to three weeks to arrive and Aid Access prescribes the two medications up to the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. But because it operates outside the formal US health care system Aid Access says it has been penalized by search engines and social media giants that have tried to tackle the spread of Covid-19 misinformation.

Aid Access still pops up on Google if you search the organization’s name but most users had come to the site while searching for terms like “abortion by mail” and “abortion pills.” Following a series of algorithm updates beginning in May 2020 Aid Access says it no longer shows up in top results for general medication abortion searches — and that ads from its sister organization Women on Web which serves countries all over the world are frequently removed or rejected from Facebook and Instagram for dubious reasons like “language ... that is likely to offend users.”

Republicans might not be able to stop Aid Access right now but it appears that Silicon Valley can.

How Aid Access works

The Aid Access model goes like this: If you need an abortion you fill out an online consultation form. If you’re early enough in your pregnancy and deemed eligible then you’re referred to a provider. People living in the country’s more liberal states and Washington DC are referred to a US-based provider who fills prescriptions that ship typically in two or three days. For women living in the 31 states that Aid Access counts as having tighter abortion restrictions Gomperts sends the prescriptions to a pharmacist in India who then mails the pills directly to patients in the US. (Aid Access chooses India in part because the country produces regulated high-quality generics Gomperts has said.)

Gomperts and the women she prescribes pills for operate in something of a legal gray area. As a result of being registered to practice medicine in Austria she is subject to Austrian law and therefore exempt from specific rules and regulations affecting doctors in the US like state requirements for ultrasounds or 72-hour waiting periods. And while personal imports of drugs from other countries are usually against US law the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has said it generally avoids going after individuals who bring medicines in for personal use.

It’s a model Gomperts developed first in 2005 with Aid Access’s older sister organization. Since its founding Women on Web says it has delivered abortion pills to more than 100000 women across the world reaching pregnant patients in countries with restrictive laws like Sudan Hungary and Brazil. In 2018 Gomperts set up Aid Access under a separate corporate structure to serve the US while protecting Women on Web from the aggressive US anti-abortion movement.

Activists note that medication abortion is far safer than many painkillers easily purchased over the counter and the World Health Organization maintains that individuals can self-administer the drugs without direct supervision of a health care provider during their first trimester. New Lancet research published in February affirmed the safety of the Aid Access model which also provides the medication at significantly lower cost than in-person surgical abortions or even the new crop of US startups like Hey Jane Abortion on Demand and Carafem.

Aid Access says its work will continue in a post-Roe environment and that requests for pills and information tripled in the wake of Monday’s leaked Roe opinion draft.

Christie Pitney a midwife who fills prescriptions for Aid Access patients in California Massachusetts Oregon and DC said that while patients in some states with trigger bans may have to switch from US-based providers like Pitney to Gomperts Aid Access will keep serving them. “We’ll still be here” she said.

“We’re pretty nonplussed to be honest” Pitney told Vox. “I don’t see a route [to stopping us]. It’s not to say that it’s impossible I just don’t see a route for politicians to eliminate access to Aid Access; they just don’t have the jurisdiction to criminalize an international doctor.”

Other international doctors could also join Aid Access if Roe were struck down to help Gomperts prescribe the abortion pills though she told Vox that thus far she has not been approached by any physicians.

A struggle for internet traffic

Despite the unique strategy Aid Access and Women on Web deploy over the past two years the organizations say they have been fighting against search engine algorithms that deprioritize their services and opaque social media policies that limit or block their posts.

Earlier this year in an interview with the New York Review of Books Gomperts said that “the algorithms of Google are suddenly becoming the de facto gatekeeper to access to safe abortion services in the US.” When Google set out to correct Covid-19 misinformation and started elevating more health sites that were officially government-sanctioned Gomperts said it had the side effect of demoting sites like hers.

Searches like “abortion by mail” and “online abortion” no longer led users to Gomperts’s groups she says. Women on Web for example says it saw a 90 percent drop in daily global traffic after Google rolled out a new update on May 4 2020. A subsequent update brought back some of what had disappeared doubling its now-minuscule traffic but then a third algorithmic update six months later took 40 percent of what remained. “We’re back to pretty low” said Venny Ala-Siurua the executive director.

Ala-Siurua told Vox that deprioritization in internet search results remains one of their biggest barriers. Google “keep[s] pushing up traditional health providers brick-and-mortar clinics but they’re missing what’s happening in the digital world today” she said. “The algorithm is not neutral. It was built and written usually by white men in the Bay Area who might not really be in tune with what the needs are here.”

Aid Access isn’t alleging Google is intentionally restricting access to its site specifically but Gomperts told the New York Review of Books that they might eventually launch a lawsuit over this. “The algorithms are making it much harder to find the places where you can obtain these medicines” she said. “That is what people don’t realize: It’s Google that is filtering people’s access to information.”

Lara Levin a Google spokesperson told Vox that their search ranking systems “are designed to return relevant results from the most reliable sources and on critical topics related to health matters we place an even greater emphasis on signals of reliability.” Levin added that no update is made to benefit or penalize any one site. “We give site owners and content producers ample notice of relevant updates along with actionable guidance” she said.

The Facebook and Instagram accounts for Women on Web have had spending restrictions placed on them for more than a year after their ads were flagged or hidden by other users who oppose their work or who found their content “to be offensive ... violent [or] about a sensitive topic.” Some of their ads for medication abortion have also been rejected with rationales like “Ads must not promote the sale or use of unsafe supplements as determined by Facebook in its sole discretion.” One Women on Web Instagram post that read “You can now order abortion pills BEFORE you are pregnant” and included a link for advanced provision was taken down for not following “community guidelines.”

Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the Women on Web ads specifically but pointed Vox to company policies from Meta (Facebook and Instagram’s parent company) including ad prohibitions for direct sales of prescription drugs and for ads promoting reproductive health products or services to people under age 18. In November 2021 Facebook also announced it would remove ad targeting options for topics people may perceive as “sensitive” — including health-related causes.

But at least one of the examples Women on Web showed Vox — the one about ordering pills before you’re pregnant — wasn’t an ad. It was a regular post to the group’s Instagram profile that they didn’t pay to amplify or target.

The algorithmic battles playing out reflect broader challenges faced by tech companies which are under pressure to crack down on misinformation and propaganda and to take clearer stands on polarized political issues that users may be researching. The last few years have also brought greater attention to the ways in which machine learning and AI more broadly can reflect bias and discrimination even while purporting to be objective and neutral.

“We have to be careful not to frame questions as one of adapting to technology” said David Broniatowski a professor at George Washington University who has studied anti-vaccination communities online. “The technology is out in the world so we should ask how to remake technology so we can achieve goals that are of best benefit to society.”

Aid Access has withstood legal challenges so far

Aid Access has faced one regulatory challenge in 2019 when the FDA sent the group a cease-and-desist letter claiming that its generic mifepristone drug represented a “misbranded and unapproved” drug that posed risk to consumers. (The FDA approved one brand of mifepristone Mifeprex in 2000 and in 2019 approved a generic version.)

Aid Access in turn sued the FDA alleging the agency was impeding Americans’ constitutional right to an abortion and that its drugs were in fact approved. Aid Access also maintained that the FDA had no legal jurisdiction over Gomperts. The case was dismissed in part because the FDA never took action following its letter.

The Biden administration has taken a friendly stance toward medication abortion but a change in the White House in 2024 or beyond could mean new challenges from the FDA or other agencies. Legal threats against Aid Access without the constitutional protection of Roe might make things even more complicated.

Anti-abortion activists and lawmakers have been ramping up their efforts to crack down on abortion pills an unsurprising development given that medication abortion accounted for 54 percent of all US abortions in 2020. In 2022 alone according to the Guttmacher Institute lawmakers in 22 states have introduced new legislation to restrict the drugs.

Rather than punish those who seek abortions the slew of anti-abortion laws introduced over the past decade has targeted physicians clinics and anyone else who helps to “aid and abet” someone who has an abortion as Texas’s recent ban put it. Abortion activists have worried about the criminalization of patients but so far efforts have been limited and largely unsuccessful.

Whether any of these new laws could affect Aid Access’s operations or the patients who seek out its services remains an outstanding question. It’s hard to know what abortion access in the US will look like in a year or five.

But for Americans seeking to end their pregnancies now — whether they live in red states with heavy abortion restrictions or in blue states with more liberal laws but heavy financial barriers — Aid Access represents a lifeline. If they can find it.",,,,,,

LOUIS — The vacant former AT&T tower that occupies an entire city block in downtown St. Louis has sold for $4.1 million less than half of what it is appraised for and just one-50th of what it sold for more than a decade ago.

The sale offers a glimmer of hope for a revitalization of the 46-story building at 909 Pine Street — one of four prominent buildings in the downtown area that are vacant. But it’s also a reminder of how weak the downtown office market is. Bondholders appraised the building at $9.2 million last year according to documents provided by data analytics firm Trepp.

New York-based SomeraRoad Inc. bought the 1.4 million-square-foot tower in late April according to records filed with the city. Ian Ross founder of SomeraRoad declined to comment.

SomeraRoad has a pattern of turning around troubled properties. In 2018 it bought and renovated Hazelwood’s Village Square Center at Interstate 270 and Dunn Road. At the time the retail center was 60% vacant. It is now less than 30% vacant with Washington University Physicians anchoring the property.

Before SomeraRoad’s acquisition the AT&T building last sold for $205 million in 2006.

That’s when owner MB REIT a subsidiary of Minto Holdings of Florida and Chicago-based Inland American Real Estate Trust bought it from AT&T. The deal was financed by investment bank Bear Stearns which failed two years later amid banking turmoil during the Great Recession.

When AT&T’s lease ended in 2017 about 2000 employees relocated to nearby buildings. That same year U.S. Bank sued the owner and foreclosed on the building. The building has been in receivership ever since. Bondholders hold some $107 million in debt on the building.

Bondholders have made a half-dozen attempts to sell the building — rejecting a 2018 offer for about $20 million from Bob Clark executive chairman and founder of the construction company Clayco and his development partner Larry Chapman.

Bondholders with few offers to entertain put the building up for auction last year with bids starting at $2.85 million.

Correspondent

Historian David Nolan spoke to an audience of nearly 100 people on May 5 in the historic St. Augustine Water Works building recently renovated by the city and leased a few months ago by the St. Johns Cultural Council.

Nolan’s “Cultural Lights of St. Augustine” a lecture in partnership with the Friends of the Main Library and the cultural council highlighted famous authors artists and musicians who have lived or visited St. Augustine over the years — and have left their mark in the cultural landscape of the nation’s oldest city.

He recalled having attended other cultural events in the Water Works building when it served as a space for the St. Augustine Garden Club such as a Tom Paxston concert in the 1960s. The singer-songwriter had well-known songs such as “The Last Thing on My Mind” “Bottle of Wine” “Whose Garden was This” and “Ramblin' Boy.”

“I always think of him when I pass by this way along San Marco Avenue” Nolan said.

Nolan also spoke on the same stage 30 years ago for a garden club event celebrating the 200th anniversary of William Bartram’s “Travels” published in 1779 which highlights his travels in the American South including St. Augustine and St. Johns County and his encounters with Native Americans between 1773 and 1777. The sites he visited here are part of the Bartram Trail with historical markers in those areas along with schools parks and neighborhoods named after William Bartram.

Nolan said that author Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings was an admirer of Bartram. Rawlings moved to the St. Augustine area when she purchased a house in Crescent Beach that was originally built in the 1930s.

“But not only did Marjorie live there she bought it with money made from ‘The Yearling’ which was the No. 1 best-selling novel of 1938 and the No. 6 best-selling novel of 1939 and which won her the Pulitzer Prize for fiction” Nolan said.

“She was living over in Cross Creek which is in the proverbial ‘middle of nowhere’ and when she got a little money she did the first thing that Floridians do she bought herself a beach house. It was a simple cottage at Crescent Beach.”

Rawlings had previously rented the cottage and wrote one of her favorite stories there “The Pelican’s Shadow” which was published on Jan. 6 1940 in The New Yorker.

“She was visited there by a kind of who’s who of international literature … Robert Frost Ernest Hemingway Zora Neale Hurston Dylan Thomas.”

A friendship blooms

Author Hurston was born in Alabama but grew up in Eatonville Florida. She visited and lived in St. Augustine several times during the 1920s through the 1940s. She portrayed racial struggles in the early-1900s American South. The most popular of her four novels is “Their Eyes Were Watching God” published in 1937.

Her autobiography “Dust Tracks on a Road” was completed just before the attack on Pearl Harbor and revised in St. Augustine. The book won the 1942 Anisfield-Wolf Book Award sponsored by Saturday Review magazine for its contribution to race relations. It was typed by the wife of a local dentist in St. Augustine.

“Zora had many skills but typing wasn’t necessarily one of them” Nolan explained. “So one day at a sporting event at Florida Memorial (a St. Augustine college where she taught briefly) she leaned over to a man next to her and said she was looking for someone who could type. That man was Dr. Rudolph Gordan a local Black dentist and he told her that his wife could type.”

So Rosie Gordon Mills who lived to about 100 years old was visited by many authors over the years who wanted to talk to her about Hurston. More than 30 books have been written about her since her death in 1960.

Nolan talked of Hurston’s well-known friendship with Rawlings which was documented in a play called “A Tea With Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings and Zora Neale Hurston” written by Florida A&M English professor and playwright Barbara Speisman in 1986.

Nolan told the story of Rawlings inviting Hurston to tea at the Warden Castle (now Ripley’s Believe it or Not! Museum) which was owned by Norton Baskin who became Rawlings' husband in 1941.

“Norton had been running a hotel in Ocala and Rawlings became an investor of Castle Warden” Nolan said. “They opened it up and got married in St. Augustine at the old St. Johns County Courthouse which is now a parking lot at the corner of Charlotte and Treasury streets.”

Hurston had invited Rawlings to speak to her class during summer school at Florida Memorial. As a thank you Rawlings invited Hurston to tea.

“And then Marjorie went back and said ‘Whoops’ because the Castle Warden was a segregated hotel and one of the regulars at happy hour was the daughter of Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith” Nolan explained.

“So she went to her husband and said ‘I may have created a little problem’ but Norton said he would have someone whisk Hurston to the elevator and away before the Confederate General’s daughter comes in …”

That plan was changed when Hurston went around to the kitchen of the hotel and was taken up to Rawlings’ apartment where they chatted and became fast friends.

St. Augustine notables

Nolan’s lecture also included insight and history about artist Martin Johnson Heade who lived in St. Augustine before Henry Flagler arrived and continued in Flagler’s artist colony. His paintings now sell for more than $1 million at auctions.

He spoke about illustrator Randolph Caldecott who is buried in St. Augustine’s Evergreen Cemetery. The British author and illustrator came to Florida because of his poor health and died at age 40. The Caldecott Medal was created in 1937 by the American Library Association and honors children’s book illustrators each year.

Nolan also talked about black artist Jacob Lawrence who was in St. Augustine at the World War II Training Center at Flagler College and became famous for his War Series artwork.

St. Augustine musical figures included composer Frederick Delius who came to St. Augustine in 1884 to run an orange grove and was influenced by the African American music of the farm workers then became a famous composer in Paris.

Performer Ray Charles was a student at Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind from 1937 to 1946 often in trouble for leaving campus and playing in bars in the Lincolnville area of downtown St. Augustine. A piano he played during that time is on view at the Lincolnville Cultural Center and Museum.

Nolan lectures on historic architectural and literary subjects. He received the annual author’s award from the Council of Florida Libraries for his first book “Fifty Feet in Paradise.” In 1995 he collaborated with artist Jean Ellen Fitzpatrick and photographer Ken Barrett to produce “The Houses of St. Augustine” a bestselling book about the Ancient City and its historic buildings.

He was a founder of ACCORD a group designed to honor the participants in St. Augustine during the civil rights movement and in 2009 he was awarded both the Governor’s Points of Light Award for outstanding community service and the President’s Volunteer Service Award awarded by then-President Barack Obama on the 45th anniversary of the passage of the Civil Rights Act.

The Water Works building was originally built in 1898 as a pumping station and used until 1926 for that purpose. After that it was converted to a community center which housed the Little Theatre of St. Augustine the St. Augustine Art Association the St. Augustine Garden Club and the Fire Camp Girls over the years.

Community and arts events will be held in the space coordinated by the SJCC. Upcoming events include A Classic Theatre’s “The Immigrant on stage May 6-8 and May 13-15.

The US Environmental Protection Agency reports that on average 14 percent of treated water in the United States leaks out. In some water systems as much as 60% of water is lost.

Leaks can spring up anywhere along water’s piped journey from reservoirs or desalination centers to water mains to indoor plumbing.

It’s never been more critical to conserve water. The UN estimates 2.3 billion people already live in water-stressed countries and water use has been growing globally at more than twice the rate of population increase in the last century.

Here’s how five Israeli companies are helping to locate and fix water leaks that waste an increasingly scarce resource.

Seeing underground

Headquartered in Rosh Ha’Ayin with offices in San Diego Tokyo and London Asterra (formerly Utilis) monitors water infrastructure for leaks using satellite imagery taken from microwave sensors embedded in the satellites from which Asterra rents airtime.

“Microwaves can penetrate 5 to 6 feet below ground which is the depth of water pipes” Asterra CTO and founder Lauren Guy tells ISRAEL21c.

Because microwaves are sensitive to conductivity Asterra can differentiate between drinking water and other kinds of water such as rain.

“If there’s drinking water in the ground it has to be coming from a pipe. We point that out to the utility” Guy explains.

Between 2017 and 2021 Asterra found more than 46000 leaks in 59 countries saving about 170000 million gallons of potable water.

“That’s equivalent to the amount used per year in a city of 3 million people” says Guy.

Asterra’s leak-detection success also has reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 108339 metric tons and saved 423200 megawatt hours of energy.

“That’s because 17% of the energy used in most developed countries is pushing water from the reservoir or desalination plant. And 25-30% of that is lost through leakages so it’s a huge waste of energy” Guy explains.

Asterra can see through the entire distribution system but its primary contribution is detecting leaks in the small service lines leading from water mains to each house Guy says.

Some 70% of leaks happen in these smaller pipes. They’re less obvious because the pressure is lower than in the water main.

“They can leak for years before anyone will know about it” Guy says. “Using satellite images manipulated with our algorithm we show utilities where we think the leakages are and they go and fix them.”

Asterra’s system – which requires no hardware or capital expenditure — also has helped in humanitarian projects.

When Hurricane Dorian in 2019 destroyed much of the water infrastructure of the Grand Bahama Utility Company Israeli humanitarian organization IsraAID helped devise an emergency water strategy and introduced Asterra’s technology to reduce leakage and energy consumption.

The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has used Asterra’s system to improve water resource management in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Residential water waste

The EPA estimates that household leaks waste nearly 1 trillion gallons of water annually across the United States.

The FlowDX micrometer from DrizzleX shows residents of multifamily buildings exactly how much water they’re using and alerts property managers about abnormal patterns that may indicate leaks.

Founded in 2019 by Israeli mathematician and software engineer Esther Altura DrizzleX has more than 3000 installations in 700 apartment houses across California Connecticut Massachusetts Georgia and New York.

“Often when we install our system we discover ongoing leaks right away and when they fix them water consumption can go down 30% or more” Altura tells ISRAEL21c.

“At the beginning of last year our micrometers were installed in a building in Huntington Beach California. One toilet in this building was leaking 3 gallons a minute” she says.

“We sent an alert but the owner ignored it because he couldn’t believe I can sit in Jerusalem and tell him there is a leak in the toilet tank in apartment 21 in Huntington Beach.”

The owner finally fixed the toilet after two months of alerts during which time that one toilet wasted 150000 gallons of water.

“His water bill for a 31-unit building was doubled because of that leaky toilet” Altura says. “Now he believes me right away. I have other landlords who see the leaks on our dashboard and 10 minutes later it’s fixed.”

Altura explains that DrizzleX’s alerts are based on data not motion sensors. Data collected from the micrometers goes into a proprietary database in the cloud where it’s monitored by AI and analyzed for abnormal usage patterns.

“We can associate the information we have with a particular building apartment and appliance” she says.

Acoustic sensing

Aquarius Spectrum uses advanced acoustic sensors for early detection of aboveground and underground water leaks in municipal water distribution networks on five continents.

Protected by 21 patents Aquarius Spectrum’s technology automatically correlates data between each pair of sensors analyzes the data with AI to verify and pinpoint the exact location of the leak(s) and presents operators with an estimation of their size and intensity on a user dashboard.

According to Aquarius Spectrum CEO Naama Zeldis “many large utilities are looking to adopt innovative solutions that enable continuous and remote monitoring of their water network.”

One US water utility located and fixed 11 leaks within the first month of installing 150 of the company’s newest AQSense-Edge sensors in a major city.

“In another US-based project where the customer recently upgraded to the new AQSense-Edge sensors more than 20 leaks were found and fixed of which several leaks were simultaneously detected on the same section of pipe by only two sensors.”

Zeldis said Aquarius has deployed more than 10000 acoustic sensors over the past 12 years “that address all types of water infrastructure.”

The Netanya-based company is now increasing its foothold in the US market with the addition of another waterworks distributor Everett J. Prescott (EJP) https://www.ejprescott.com/ which does business in 10 states.

Self-detection and repair

Curapipe offers a no-dig in-pipe leak self-detection and repair solution for defects in joints pinholes or cracks in water mains and service pipes.

Co-CEO Peter Paz says these problems are responsible for “the lion’s share of drinking water losses.”

The company’s Trenchless Automated Leakage Repair (TALR) technology uses water pressure to send a “train” containing a composite sealant through the pipes. The technology automatically finds and plugs defects as it passes over them.

“Ideally TALR is applied in networks that suffer from extreme water losses — even up to 60% of the total supply” Paz tells ISRAEL21c.

“Our solution is far superior to manually excavating and repairing leaks when it comes to bulk reduction of leakage levels” he says.

There’s minimal service disruption as the utility doesn’t have to drain or clean the pipes first; the operation can be finished in less than a day. The system also measures and maintains a database of the exact level of leakage repaired.

TALR was invented in 2007 by four hydraulics and materials experts and was developed in pilot projects with London’s Thames Water Utility and the Jerusalem Water Utility.

Paz says that field data from Curapipe projects in Israel Italy South Africa Brazil Mexico and the UK indicate that TALR reduces over 90% of leakage levels.

In one case Curapipe repaired every leak in a kilometer-long cast iron water pipe in Brescia Italy which was leaking some 10 cubic meters every hour. This effectively saved 89.8 million liters of water that would have leaked from that one pipe over the course of a year.

Based in Kiryat Malachi Curapipe operates in several countries and is now poised to enter the US market with the launch of its Customer Side Leakage Repair (CSLR) system that applies TALR technology to swimming pools.

CSLR’s digital layer provides real-time operating instructions and insights about the nature of the leak and its approximate location in addition to a before-and-after repair report.

Water intelligence

Based in Rosh Ha’Ayin with offices in the UK Boston and New York WINT uses artificial intelligence to detect and stop leaks at the source.

Its IoT water-flow analysis devices for construction commercial and industrial applications alert managers when water is leaking and can automatically shut it off.

“Buildings are a major source of water waste and carbon emissions: a single leaking toilet will typically lose water at the rate of 1 million gallons a year which result in 4.5 tons of greenhouse emissions — similar to the total annual emissions from a passenger car” said Yaron Dycian chief strategy officer for WINT.

WINT was named to Fast Company’s inaugural Next Big Things in Tech https://www.fastcompany.com/next-big-things-in-tech list last November on the basis of a pilot program with PepsiCo that cut water consumption at a Belgian snack facility by 10%. PepsiCo is now rolling out Wint’s tech to five European sites.

The company completed a $15 million Series B funding round in January from investors including Insight Partners Israeli serial entrepreneur Marius Nacht and several global construction and real-estate companies.

ELIZABETH Pa. (KDKA) - Crews were called to another water main break in Elizabeth borough.

The water main break happened on Second Avenue Sunday morning the same street where a main broke and then burst again Friday.

Photos from the scene show a large hole in the road and water going into some buildings.

The largest indoor waterpark in the United States right now is at Kalahari Resorts in Round Rock Texas.

Kalahari Resort just northeast of Austin Texas is a 1.5 million square foot property which includes the largest indoor waterpark in the United States an indoor amusement space 20 dining options a spa hotel convention space and other cool stuff.

A plan is in the works now to build a 320000 square-foot waterpark next to the Mall of America in Bloomington Minnesota.

The proposed giant water structure is called Mystery Cove. Construction on Mystery Cove could start this summer with an opening date sometime in 2024.

This new soon-to-be largest indoor waterpark in America would have water slides beaches a giant wave pool a food hall and more cool stuff and there are plans for an attached hotel.

The plan is to build this monster waterpark next to the IKEA store across the street from the Mall of America with a skywalk to connect the two.

The total price tag on the 335000 square feet waterpark project would be approximately $422 million with public and private financing.

When open full-price admission to Mystery Cove would be from $60 - $70 per person.

The company behind the project is Triple Five which also owns The West Edmonton Mall in Canada which is very similar to the Mystery Cove project at the Mall of America.

The company accumulated $6.2 billion in total revenues a 6% increase compared with Q1 2021 resulting from 2% growth in global product sales and increased revenue from Amgen’s manufacturing collaboration for COVID-19 drugs.

Biosimilar Performance

According to the report Amgevita (adalimumab-atto) was the most prescribed adalimumab biosimilar throughout Europe. From Q1 2021 to Q1 2022 the biosimilar had increased year-over-year sales of 2% caused by 16% volume growth. The increase in net sales was partially offset by foreign exchange impact and lower net selling price resulting from increased competition from other adalimumab biosimilars. In the European Union there are 10 adalimumab biosimilars competing with the reference product (Humira).

Net sales for Mvasi (bevacizumab-awwb) decreased 17% year-over-year which the company attributed to lower net selling price partially offset by 13% volume growth. Mvasi is 1 of 3 bevacizumab biosimilars in the United States. The European Union has 7 bevacizumab biosimilars referencing Avastin including Mvasi. Amgen said that it expects that Mvasi’s net selling price and volume declines driven by increased competition will continue to erode.

Kanjinti (trastuzumab-anns) was the highest selling trastuzumab biosimilar in the United States where it is 1 of 5 FDA-approved biosimilars for Herceptin. However the global sales for the drug decreased 40% year-over-year due to the same reasons that sales for Mvasi decreased. In the European Union there are 6 trastuzumab biosimilars approved for marketing.

Amgen combined the sales for Avsola (infliximab-axxq) and Riabni (rituximab-arrx) with Gensenta Imlygic Corlanor and Bergamo into the “other products” category. The sales for this group increased by 18% between Q1 2021 and Q2 2022.

Reference Product Performance

Amgen reported that year-over-year net sales decreased by 7% and the year-over-year volume remained flat during Q1 2022 for Enbrel (etanercept). The company said this was due to declines in net price and inventory levels. Although Enbrel will not face any biosimilar competition in the United States until 2029 the drug is competing against 3 etanercept biosimilars in the European Union.

In the report Amgen combined the sales for Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) Neupogen (filgrastim) and Epogen (epoetin alfa) with other “established products” including Aranesp Parsabiv and Sensipar/Mimpara. The sales for these products amounted to $970 million during Q1 2022 representing a 12% year-over-year decrease. Neulasta Neupogen and Epogen all face biosimilar competition in the United States and European Union and Amgen said that it expects that net price and volume erosion will continue.

Amgen’s Biosimilar Pipeline

Amgen updated investors on its 4 biosimilars in development including Amgevita. Although the drug is marketed in Europe and approved by the FDA the company is conducting a phase 3 study that will provide data to support an interchangeability designation in the United States.

If granted pharmacists will be able to automatically switch out Humira for the biosimilars without needing to seek provider permission. Amgevita is anticipated to be the first adalimumab biosimilar to enter the US market in January 2023 where it will be marketed as Amjevita.

Additionally phase 3 studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of biosimilars referencing Stelara (ustekinumab) Eylea (aflibercept) and Soliris (eculizumab) are in progress. The company is also conducted a phase 3 analysis to support interchangeability for its ustekinumab biosimilar (ABP 654). Data for the studies assessing ABP 938 (aflibercept biosimilar) and ABP 959 (eculizumab biosimilar) are expected to be completed in 2022.",,,,,,,,,,,,

If you use these you support the website. Thanks!

Chinese low-budget guitar pedal and music tech manufacturer Donner has launched B1 it’s first 303-style analog bassline Synthesizer with sequencer.

If you start playing the guitar as a young musician you often don’t have the big budget to buy the high-end pedals from Strymon Eventide or others. The first click then usually goes to Amazon or other international retailers where you can get affordable pedals.

Here you can also find the Chinese brand Donner which has released many very affordable effect pedals in recent years. Already for less than 20€. I also took a closer look at some of them with synths (Yellow Fall Wave Tutti Love Vintaverb). Today came the news that Donner now also builds affordable synthesizers.I t’s not a hot SB news but a synth news worth reporting.

Donner B1 Analog Bass Synthesizer

B1 is Donner’s first Synthesizer. It is an analog bass Synthesizer with a single oscillator. The alarm bells are going off: single oscillator design could this be a 303 clone? It could be because: you can choose two wavefroms either sawtooth or square and modify the pitch. Like on the original Roland TB-303.

Then the signal flows into a filter with cutoff resonance and depth controls. On the modulation side you get a simple decay envelope. Also similar.

It also a built-in distortion/saturation to add spice to your sounds and a tape delay effect. Each effect can be turn on and off individually with a switch. The effects circuits are probably from their pedal series.

Step Sequencer

The B1 analog bass Synthesizer can be played in various ways. Either with 26 silicone keys with colored backlights with an sequencer or via MIDI. Yes there is a step sequencer. It looks like it has 16 steps (bottom key row) with 128 factory sequence presets and 128 user programmable presets. The sequencer controls are located on the right side. You can find here: tap tempo pattern gate length slide play/stop save accent with a dedicated amount knob rec/edit clear/rest and ratcheting.

In the same field you can find additional keyboard controls including octave up/down an arpeggiator and a hold function.

Connectivity

The synth has front panel and rear panel connections. On the front you have an aux in headphone sync in and syc out. At first I thought “oh cool modular patch points” but I was wrong.

On the backside you have a USB-C socket for USB-MIDI so you can use it as a MIDI keyboard as well. There is a MIDI in/out interface on 2.5mm TRS allowing you to send MIDI data to other synths. Thus the B1 is also a MIDI sequencer.

Audio side you get an 1/8” audio input for routing external audio in the synth as well as a 1/4″ TS mono main output. And almost forgot there is also a big master output knob on the interface.

First Impression & Availability

Donner one of the best-known companies for low-budget guitar pedals is now making synthesizers. That’s interesting news. There is currently no sound demo of the B1 analog bass Synthesizer in the wild. Even without a demo I’m pretty sure the sound journey is going in the corner of the Roland TB-303/Behringer TD-3.

The features are almost the same (single oscillator decay envelope accent control…). Only with a different interface and operation. And that looks not bad at all. I’m very curious to see if it can keep up with other current bassline synthesizers. In terms of price it nearly aligns on the well-known 303 clones from China. Or is it even just a repackaged 303 clone?

Donner B1 Analog Bass Synthesizer is available now for $168.99 USD from the Donner US webshop. It looks like it’s currently only available from the US warehouse. Use the code K8 to save an additional 8% OFF and get it for $15548 USD plus shipping.

REUTERS

Several Nigerian airlines want to ground domestic flights from Monday due to high jet fuel costs.

On Friday the Airline Operators of Nigeria issued a statement which was seen by BBC News.

An umbrella body representing the airlines said the cost of jet fuel has soared nearly fourfold this year.

Nigeria's biggest airlines are threatening to stop domestic flights from Monday as a result of the rise in jet fuel prices according to the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON).

In a statement issued on Friday the AON which represents nine of the country's domestic carriers said that the cost of imported jet fuel had increased nearly fourfold as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The statement was seen by BBC News and Reuters and widely circulated on social media.

As a result airline operating costs had risen from about 40% to nearly 95% and operators had already subsidized their services to passengers over the past four months the AON said.

""No airline in the world can absorb this kind of sudden shock from such an astronomical rise over a short period"" the AON's president Dr. Abdulmunaf Yunusa Sarina said in its statement.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine created a disruption in the global distribution of crude oil. This combined with high demand for travel has caused the cost of airline tickets to soar.

AON said that its airline members had previously engaged with the Nigerian government its state-owned oil company and fuel marketers in an effort to bring down the cost of jet fuel. It said the cost can not be passed on to passengers as it was ""unsustainable"" for airlines who can ""no longer absorb the pressure"" per the statement.

One signatory to the statement Azman Air confirmed on Twitter that it plans to suspend domestic flights from Monday until further notice. Similarly United Nigeria Airlines appeared to make a statement by posting a screenshot of the news to its own Twitter account.

However at least one airline is not on board with this plan. Ibom Air which flies to seven cities in Nigeria is listed as a signatory on the statement. But it said on Saturday it will not halt its domestic flights from Monday as such a move would affect revenues and impact its commitments to suppliers and financiers per a Reuters report.

Nigeria's competition watchdog – the Federal Competition & Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) – urged the AON to reconsider its plans saying in a statement posted on Saturday on its Twitter account that they could create a ""magnitude of difficulties"" for passengers.

It also appeared to warn airlines not to sell tickets for flights it does not plan to go ahead with.

""The Commission is concerned with rising consumer feedback that airlines have continued to sell tickets beyond the date announced for proposed service shutdown"" FCCPC chief executive said in the statement.



""It will be egregious exploitation of consumers and a violation of law to purport to sell a service that the service provider knows it will not or does not intend to provide or deliver"" it added.

The AON and FCCPC did not immediately respond to Insider's request for further comment.

An AoN is accorded by the Defence Ministry for a particular weapon system or equipment at the beginning of the procurement process.

Over 150 Indian companies participated in the symposium showcasing the technologies they have on offer to the Indian armed forces.

Addressing the participants Raju said “Hereafter the Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) will only be given to indigenous defence manufacturers. We will come more than half a distance to meet your aspirations. We will give you all the facilities that are required whether it is equipment testing facilities and most importantly our time.”

Raju told the industry members that the Army will “not ask you the moon” and the Preliminary Service Quality Requirements (PSQRs) the requirements that an equipment or weapon needs to meet “that we are going to give are going to be reasonable so that you are able to produce”. He said if the industry can meet 80 per cent of “our aspirations then we will go ahead and issue orders”.

He later told journalists that the Army is working on making the PSQRs simpler. Army’s strict PSQRs have been a cause of lament by many industry members.

Speaking about the kind of technology the Army is looking for Raju said “We need drones of all kinds which are able to do persistent surveillance carry payload carry ammunition to the place of choice secure communication medical equipment troops on ground need good habitat and so on.”

Explained Made-in-India push The move is part of the government push to encourage the country's nascent defence industry and to wean off dependence on foreign weapons as India is one of the top importers in the world in this segment. Indian Army has entered into contracts worth Rs 40000 crore with the Indian industry in the last two years. Army's immediate requirement is equipment of surveillance especially drones and mountaineering gear and clothing for high-altitude.

Speaking to a few journalists Northern Army Commander Lt Gen Upendra Dwivedi later said there are two immediate requirements that the Army is looking for. “The immediate requirements are what we were exporting from outside. And where we feel that the enemy has a technology which we need to counter. These are the two major criteria” he said.

Lt Gen Dwivedi said the Army is looking for domestic alternatives to Special Clothing and Mountaineering Equipment (SCME) and surveillance equipment such as drones. He said “because this technology is evolving every day so whatever we are doing the adversary is able to find a counter to it. We have to again look for a counter”.

Dwivedi said that these technologies are being developed internationally but “by the time they come here they are obsolete if I can say. Therefore it is imperative for us to develop these technologies in India so that we are also able to evolve and graduate to a higher level in conjunction with what the adversary is doing or even better than that”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vYWZhYW5vcm9tb28vb2R1dS02MTM2OTIxMdIBMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vYWZhYW5vcm9tb28vb2R1dS02MTM2OTIxMS5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Naayijeeriyaan sababa gatiin boba'aa dabaleef balalii xiyyaaraa adda kutuuf turte dhiiste,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYW5uZWxzdHYuY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvMDcvaWJvbS1haXJsaW5lcy1yZWplY3RzLW1vbmRheS1zaHV0ZG93bi10by1jb250aW51ZS1vcGVyYXRpb25zL9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYW5uZWxzdHYuY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvMDcvaWJvbS1haXJsaW5lcy1yZWplY3RzLW1vbmRheS1zaHV0ZG93bi10by1jb250aW51ZS1vcGVyYXRpb25zL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ibom Airlines Rejects Monday Shutdown To Continue Operations,"Ibom Airlines says it will not join the planned shutdown of flights announced by the Airlines Operators of Nigeria (AON).

The AON had on Friday said its members would suspend flight services on Monday due to the unbearable high cost of aviation fuel (JetA1) and other associated costs.

But in a statement Ibom Airlines said obligations to its customers suppliers and staff would not allow it participate in the shutdown.

“Apart from the above factors Ibom Air is currently the only airline serving Akwa Ibom State directly and as such any voluntary stoppage of operations would completely cut off access by air into and out of the State” the statement added.

“Such action would be directly in conflict with and detrimental to the interest of our shareholder.”

The Ministry of Aviation had on Saturday appealed to the local airline operators to reconsider their decision to suspend services.

Meanwhille the Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to intervene and avert the imminent shutdown which it believes will cripple the nation’s economy.

Mr. Kingsley Ezenwa Manager Communications and Marketing Dana Airlines confirmed this in a statement on Sunday in Lagos.

Dana is the second airline to pull out of the suspension after Ibom Air said it would not be joining the action initiated by the airline body.

“Following the recent press statement by the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) it has become necessary for us to take a stand in the overall interest of our guests corporate partners staff and the industry at large.

“While Dana Air agrees with the AON on all the challenges facing domestic airlines in Nigeria and has on many occasions actively participated in the collective and ongoing engagement of relevant authorities on the urgent need to tackle the many issues domestic airlines have been grappling with which includes the skyrocketing cost of Jet A1 we have taken a decision not to join the suspension of flights on May 9 2022.

“We acknowledge that the present cost of jet A1 is unsustainable and should not be passed to the flying public.

“We therefore call on the government to act urgently to resolve these unending operational challenges while Dana Air will continue to support every effort by the AON to achieve a quick and peaceful resolution in the interest of our dear country Nigeria.

“We appreciate and thank our customers once again for choosing to fly with us” he stated."

I posted this in the 6800XT/6900XT thread  but I feel like it's not getting the visibility it deserves so I'm posting in the main forum so that people can see that the cMP isgoing strong now with the addition of AMD's 6k series cards all thanks to Syncretic I am more than happy to report that @Syncretic 's patch does work 100% to install an RX-6800XT on a cMP 41>51 running OpenCore 0.8.0 Big Sur 11.6.5 the rest of my specs are in my sig. (@Greggant if you wanna mention this confirmation on the DMUG youtube gimme a shoutout!As soon as Syncretic made his post I returned my RX-5700XT and acquired a brand new RX-6800XT.Whilte I waited for the 6800XT to arrive I went back to my XFX RX-580 so you will see before and after pics below. Since I had previously already done the Pixlas mod for the 5700XT it was a simple plug and play.Here you go folks as promised the excitement!:The day I installed it (May 1st) I ran some quick benchmarks:As you can see from the various benchmarks the cMP now easily DECIMATES the 20-core Ultra Mac Studio in terms of graphics processing power. Just had to put that out there as I'm tired of reading BS posts from iSheep around that.I ran a bunch of different benchmarks in the 6800XT thread  so if you're interested in that take a look beginning on page 39.Again just wanted to put this here so that it gets the visibility that it deserves. This proves that thanks to the brilliant work by members of this community our cMP's are STILL very powerful and capable machines even 12 years down the line. I want to thank you guys especially Syncretic and the OpenCore team for keeping this very capable machine still purring like a kitten!Cheers!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9maXJzdC11cy1hcHBsZS1zdG9yZS11bmlvbi1lbGVjdGlvbi1pcy1zZXQtZm9yLWVhcmx5LWp1bmUtMTQzNTE3MjYzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First U.S. Apple store union election is set for early June,"The first-ever U.S. union election at an Apple (AAPL) retail store is slated for early June.

Apple retail workers in Atlanta released a statement in the aftermath of filing for a union election. Those workers who are all at Apple’s Cumberland Mall location in Atlanta are situated in the wake of the Amazon (AMZN) Labor Union’s historic victory about a month ago – and they’ve been inspired by that said Sydney Rhodes a worker and union member.

“Last year there weren’t many people who were talking about creating a union or anything of that nature” said Rhodes. “So to see what we’ve been working on that other people are working on it and that their efforts are being recognized it’s inspiring. It’s given us hope that something’s possible.”

There are 107 workers at Apple's Cumberland Mall location in Atlanta who are eligible to vote in the election. The election will take place on June 3 4 and 5 according to Beth Allen communications director at Communications Workers of America (CWA).

CWA is representing the Atlanta Apple workers who are asking for things like fair and transparent compensation practices career development opportunities diversity commitments and parity with corporate employees when it comes to things like compensation

“The people that work in our store can't even afford to live within a 10 to 15 mile radius of where we work” said Rhodes. “Apple’s about decreasing its carbon footprint but employees have to either take a bus or drive a half-hour to an hour to get to work.”

“We want to sit across the table and help make decisions because ultimately there are people making calls for retail who’ve just never worked in retail” she added.

The Amazon-Starbucks effect

Though the Amazon Labor Union recently lost its second election in Staten Island workers across the country are still charging forward. Workers in Rhodes' store have been discussing unionizing for about a year. She's noticed a massive sea change in public opinion that's tied to not only Amazon but union efforts at Starbucks (SBUX).

Though Apple and Amazon are intuitively connected as tech giants Apple retail workers as a whole (including those who are organizing in Atlanta) ultimately have a lot in common with Starbucks employees Allen told Yahoo Finance.

""I think [the union and Apple] were generally in agreement on who should be in the bargaining unit though often employers contest that"" she said. ""We've seen that happening a lot at Activision Blizzard (ATVI) where we're also organizing but at this retail store it's pretty clear cut who's the supervisor and who's not.""

Story continues

Ultimately for Rhodes and her colleagues unionizing reflects their commitment to Apple she said.

“We love our jobs and we love our company” Rhodes told Yahoo Finance. “We love everything about it but we also know that Apple is a company that’s about being progressive and being a leader.”

Videos show workers at an Apple and Tesla plant in Shanghai clashing with quarantine officials.

The workers were said to be frustrated with onsite COVID-19 measures.

The clash underscores the frailty of Shanghai's plans to reopen its factories amid strict lockdowns.

More than a hundred workers at a major Apple and Tesla production plant in Shanghai clashed with quarantine officials and security guards in a stunning altercation on Thursday videos on Twitter and YouTube show.

Workers at Quanta Shanghai Manufacturing City were filmed jumping over turnstiles as officials in white protective gear tried to prevent them from breaching the building.

Some workers exchanged physical blows with the guards. At one point a female worker appeared to smack someone in protective gear so that a male worker who was locked in a struggle with the person in protective gear could get away.

The skirmish happened when officials prevented workers from heading back to their dormitories after completing their shifts Bloomberg and Reuters reported. Anonymous interviewees said the workers were frustrated with onsite Covid restrictions per Bloomberg.

Some said that they were concerned about getting infected by workers who returned from quarantine centers according to told Taiwanese news outlets USTV and UDN. They also feared that a spread of the virus on the factory floor would result in the campus going into a strict lockdown again per the Taiwanese news reports.

Quanta Apple and Tesla did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comments.

The altercation underscores the fragility of Shanghai's attempts to get its factories up and running even as large swathes of the 25-million-strong city have remained under strict lockdown for more than a month.

In an attempt to minimize the lockdown's impact on Shanghai's economy authorities have allowed some factories including Tesla's gigafactory to continue operating under a ""closed loop"" system where workers work live eat and sleep onsite and at nearby dormitories.

Taiwanese-owned Quanta produces three-quarters of Apple's MacBooks globally and assembles computer circuit boards for Tesla's cars. The Shanghai factory accounts for about 20% of Quanta's output for Apple USTV reported. It also produces computer circuit boards for Tesla.

On April 13 Quanta temporarily suspended operations in Shanghai to comply with local COVID-19 prevention measures. That prompted TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo to say that delivery of MacBook Pros would be delayed by three to five weeks.

The factory gradually resumed operations starting April 18 with about 2000 of its 40000-person workforce returning to the plant China's state media Xinhua reported.







While news of the clash at Quanta's Shanghai factory spread on Twitter and YouTube and was widely reported by Taiwanese media outlets there was barely any mention of it on Chinese social media platforms and in Chinese media.

According to the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission the city reported 3625 asymptomatic Covid cases 322 symptomatic cases and 11 deaths on Sunday. Some of these patients worked at factories operating under a closed-loop system.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy9jb21wYW5pZXMtcGF5LXRyYXZlbC1jb3N0cy1hYm9ydGlvbnPSAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vcG9saXRpY3MvY29tcGFuaWVzLXBheS10cmF2ZWwtY29zdHMtYWJvcnRpb25zLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The companies paying travel costs for abortions: Tesla Amazon Citi on small but growing list,"Texas-based Tesla Inc. is among a small but growing number of U.S. companies offering to cover travel costs for employees who need to cross state lines for medical care including an abortion.

Companies are offering these benefits as the landscape of state and federal abortion policy in America is shifting. Texas implemented the country’s strictest abortion law last November when it banned abortion after six weeks of pregnancy and deputized citizens to enforce the rule. Other states including Idaho Florida and Oklahoma have passed laws in recent months tightening access to the procedure.

Earlier this week a leaked Supreme Court draft opinion indicated the court may be preparing to overturn Roe v. Wade the 1973 precedent that established a constitutional right to an abortion.

The 67-page draft first reported on Monday by Politico declared that Roe was ""egregiously wrong and deeply damaging.""

Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement Tuesday that the draft written in February wasn’t necessarily the final resolution in the case. The court is expected to issue its opinion by the end of June or early July.

FTC TO REVIEW MUSK'S $44B TWITTER BUY UNDER ANTI-TRUST: REPORT

If Roe v. Wade is overturned it would open the door to stronger state restrictions including bans on the procedure.

Companies offering to help employees travel to get an abortion may be on safe legal ground for the moment but that could change.

Texas’s abortion law extends liability to abortion clinics and doctors as well as those who aid an abortion. Oklahoma and Idaho have passed similar legislation. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt enacted the law this week and Idaho’s law was temporarily blocked in court. Some lawmakers meanwhile have pushed back on the new company policies.

Here a look at some of the companies who have expanded benefits:

Tesla

Tesla TSLA -0.87%▼ which announced the relocation of its headquarters last October to Austin Texas said in its 2021 ""Impact Report"" that the company has an expanded ""health insurance offering that includes travel and lodging support for those who may need to seek healthcare services that are unavailable in their home state."" Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment Friday.

Amazon

Amazon.com Inc. headquartered in Seattle told employees it would reimburse up to $4000 annually for travel expenses for medical treatments including abortions that employees can’t access within 100 miles of their homes.

Citigroup

Citigroup Inc. in a proxy filing for its April shareholder meeting said that starting this year it is offering travel benefits for employees to seek resources due to changes in reproductive healthcare laws. More than 10000 full- and part-time Citi employees live in Texas.

Yelp

Yelp Inc. based in San Francisco is offering employees and their dependents financial assistance through insurance if they need to travel out of state for abortion care. Yelp’s YELP -4.34%▼ health insurance currently covers abortion care.

Apple

Tech giant Apple Inc. which is expanding its presence in Austin with a new $1 billion 3-million-square-foot campus also said its health-insurance policies cover abortion services and travel fees if necessary.

Levi Strauss

California-based Levi Strauss & Co. has said it would reimburse medical travel expenses for full-time and part-time employees.

AMAT,Applied Materials,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vZmxhdGhlYWRiZWFjb24uY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvMDgvYXBwbGllZC1tYXRlcmlhbHMtZXhwYW5zaW9uLWJyaW5ncy0yMDAtam9icy10by1ldmVyZ3JlZW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Applied Materials Expansion Brings 200 Jobs to Evergreen,"After purchasing the former Shopko building in Evergreen that sat vacant for four years Applied Materials will begin full semiconductor-plating manufacturing production in the 100000-square-foot building next month to meet the demand of the growing industry.

As the third Applied Materials location in the Flathead Valley the new facility will bring 200 new jobs to the region. Job positions range from manufacturers to engineers to managers and the company already employs 600 people in the Flathead Valley alone. The expansion will bring the total square footage to 350000 among three buildings.

The semiconductor-plating manufacturer has seen significant growth over the last two years adding thousands of employees to all branches which includes facilities in Austin Texas and Singapore.

“The demand has never been greater (for microchips)” Dennis McHaffie the vice president of business operations for Applied Materials said at a ribbon cutting ceremony in Evergreen on May 4. “We can’t ship them fast enough – we’re having all of the right problems.”

Applied Materials’ expansion will bring hundreds of more jobs to the valley and the company’s officials have already been busy recruiting employees for their other locations.

Montana Site General Manager Brian Aegerter says there are currently 50 job openings for Kalispell’s two established campuses and recruitment teams will phase in 200 more for the new location in Evergreen over the next year and a half.

Aegerter says the company has been hosting weekly job fairs and recruitment efforts have been gaining strides in the last few weeks.

Most job openings are for manufacturing positions Aegerter said which include benefits and range from $17 per hour to almost $30 per hour depending on experience.

While the valley continues to struggle to recruit and retain employees Kalispell Mayor Mark Johnson spoke at the ceremony and reassured the audience that local government agencies are doing what they can to bring more housing to the region for potential employees which remains a recruitment challenge.

“As we grow as a community we have a lot of challenges” Johnson said. “We have to hire 200 new people for this building and that is the next challenge. We are doing what we can to deliver housing.”

In addition to staffing shortages Applied Materials also continues to struggle with supply chain constraints as shutdowns in China and the war in Ukraine disrupt production.

“Supply chain issues are getting worse actually” Aegerter said. “The interdependency on the supply chain has become a problem. When one area has a problem the ripple effect is amplified.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vYXUubGlmZXN0eWxlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvYXBwbGllZC1tYXRlcmlhbHMtbmFzZGFxLWFtYXQtYW5ub3VuY2VkLTEyMzIwMDQwOS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) Has Announced That It Will Be Increasing Its Dividend To US$0.26,"The board of Applied Materials Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend on the 16th of June to US$0.26. Despite this raise the dividend yield of 0.9% is only a modest boost to shareholder returns.

See our latest analysis for Applied Materials

Applied Materials' Payment Has Solid Earnings Coverage

While yield is important another factor to consider about a company's dividend is whether the current payout levels are feasible. However Applied Materials' earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow.

The next year is set to see EPS grow by 16.1%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends we think the payout ratio could be 13% by next year which is in a pretty sustainable range.

Applied Materials Has A Solid Track Record

The company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from US$0.32 in 2012 to the most recent annual payment of US$1.04. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 13% per annum over that time. Rapidly growing dividends for a long time is a very valuable feature for an income stock.

The Dividend Looks Likely To Grow

The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. We are encouraged to see that Applied Materials has grown earnings per share at 30% per year over the past five years. Earnings have been growing rapidly and with a low payout ratio we think that the company could turn out to be a great dividend stock.

We Really Like Applied Materials' Dividend

In summary it is always positive to see the dividend being increased and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Earnings are easily covering distributions and the company is generating plenty of cash. All in all this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.

Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

Apple retail workers in Atlanta released a statement in the aftermath of filing for a union election. Those workers who are all at Apple’s Cumberland Mall location in Atlanta are situated in the wake of the Amazon (AMZN) Labor Union’s historic victory about a month ago – and they’ve been inspired by that said Sydney Rhodes a worker and union member.

“Last year there weren’t many people who were talking about creating a union or anything of that nature” said Rhodes. “So to see what we’ve been working on that other people are working on it and that their efforts are being recognized it’s inspiring. It’s given us hope that something’s possible.”

There are 107 workers at Apple's Cumberland Mall location in Atlanta who are eligible to vote in the election. The election will take place on June 3 4 and 5 according to Beth Allen communications director at Communications Workers of America (CWA).

CWA is representing the Atlanta Apple workers who are asking for things like fair and transparent compensation practices career development opportunities diversity commitments and parity with corporate employees when it comes to things like compensation

“The people that work in our store can't even afford to live within a 10 to 15 mile radius of where we work” said Rhodes. “Apple’s about decreasing its carbon footprint but employees have to either take a bus or drive a half-hour to an hour to get to work.”

“We want to sit across the table and help make decisions because ultimately there are people making calls for retail who’ve just never worked in retail” she added.

The Amazon-Starbucks effect

Though the Amazon Labor Union recently lost its second election in Staten Island workers across the country are still charging forward. Workers in Rhodes' store have been discussing unionizing for about a year. She's noticed a massive sea change in public opinion that's tied to not only Amazon but union efforts at Starbucks (SBUX).

Though Apple and Amazon are intuitively connected as tech giants Apple retail workers as a whole (including those who are organizing in Atlanta) ultimately have a lot in common with Starbucks employees Allen told Yahoo Finance.

""I think [the union and Apple] were generally in agreement on who should be in the bargaining unit though often employers contest that"" she said. ""We've seen that happening a lot at Activision Blizzard (ATVI) where we're also organizing but at this retail store it's pretty clear cut who's the supervisor and who's not.""

Story continues

Ultimately for Rhodes and her colleagues unionizing reflects their commitment to Apple she said.

“We love our jobs and we love our company” Rhodes told Yahoo Finance. “We love everything about it but we also know that Apple is a company that’s about being progressive and being a leader.”

According to a statement the company gave to Automotive News Europe BMW has changed suppliers and begun using a chip that does not fully support Android Auto or CarPlay. As a result the company continued in its statement affected vehicles will receive an over-the-air software update by ""the end of June at the latest.""

As 9to5Google notes you can check if your recently purchased vehicle is affected by checking for ""6P1"" in the car's production code. It also seems that all of the vehicles in question were manufactured in the first four months of 2022 and have final destinations in the US France Italy Spain and the UK.

This is not the first time that BMW has delivered cars missing certain non-essential features in order to avoid shipping delays. Last fall the company omitted touchscreen features from some vehicles also due to the global chip shortage. And BMW is hardly the only automaker to take this tack either. Last fall around the same time BMW was grappling with the touchscreen issue Tesla decided to ship some cars without USB ports. Then earlier this year Ford shipped some Explorer SUVs without rear climate controls.

In the case of BMW's missing Android Auto and CarPlay support it could be worse. As Automotive News Europe notes when Mercedes-Benz was faced with a similar dilemma it chose not to include the requisite chips in some vehicles at which point customers would be forced to bring their cars into a ship to have them installed later.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9wcmlzY2lsbGEtcHJlc2xleS1zYXlzLXNlZWluZy1tdWNoLTE0NTIwNDUyMy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Priscilla Presley Says Seeing How Much Daughter Lisa Marie 'Loved' Elvis Movie Brought Her to Tears,"NEW YORK NEW YORK - MAY 02: (Exclusive Coverage) Priscilla Presley arrives at The 2022 Met Gala Celebrating ""In America: An Anthology of Fashion"" at The Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 02 2022 in New York City.

""The story as we all know does not have a happy ending. But I think you will understand a little bit more of Elvis' journey penned by a directer [sic] who put his heart and soul and many hours into this film"" she concluded.

Gallagher's Recent Short Interest - Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG),"Loading... Loading...

Arthur J. Gallagher's AJG short percent of float has risen 5.71% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.11 million shares sold short which is 1.11% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume it would take traders 2.65 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Gallagher & Co.'s (NYSE:AJG) Stock?,"Most readers would already be aware that Arthur J. Gallagher's (NYSE:AJG) stock increased significantly by 11% over the past three months. Given the company's impressive performance we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Specifically we decided to study Arthur J. Gallagher's ROE in this article.

Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.

See our latest analysis for Arthur J. Gallagher

How To Calculate Return On Equity?

The formula for ROE is:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So based on the above formula the ROE for Arthur J. Gallagher is:

12% = US$987m ÷ US$8.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2021).

The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has the company made $0.12 in profit.

Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?

So far we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"" we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged the higher the ROE and profit retention the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.

Arthur J. Gallagher's Earnings Growth And 12% ROE

To begin with Arthur J. Gallagher seems to have a respectable ROE. Further the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 11%. Consequently this likely laid the ground for the decent growth of 15% seen over the past five years by Arthur J. Gallagher.

As a next step we compared Arthur J. Gallagher's net income growth with the industry and pleasingly we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 12%.

Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is AJG worth today?

Is Arthur J. Gallagher Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?

Arthur J. Gallagher has a three-year median payout ratio of 45% which implies that it retains the remaining 55% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered and given the decent growth seen by the company it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.

Besides Arthur J. Gallagher has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 31% over the next three years. As a result the expected drop in Arthur J. Gallagher's payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 15% over the same period.

Summary

In total we are pretty happy with Arthur J. Gallagher's performance. Particularly we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings.

La Russie prépare les célébrations du Jour de la Victoire

(Severodonetsk) Moscou exhibe lundi son armée pour célébrer la victoire sur l’Allemagne nazie en 1945 une démonstration de force afin de galvaniser ses troupes à la peine en Ukraine où soixante civils ont péri selon Kyiv dans le bombardement d’une école.

Dmitry ZAKS avec Joshua MELVIN à Zaporijjia Agence France-Presse

Le président russe Vladimir Poutine qui doit prononcer un discours très attendu aura l’occasion d’envoyer de nouveaux avertissements après avoir plusieurs fois brandi la menace nucléaire.

Selon le ministère russe de la Défense l’« avion de l’Apocalypse » un Iliouchine Il-80 conçu pour permettre au président russe de continuer à piloter le pays depuis les airs en cas de guerre nucléaire survolera la place Rouge et plusieurs armes pouvant tirer des missiles nucléaires défileront également. Des parachutistes ayant participé à l’offensive en Ukraine devraient également être présents selon l’agence d’État TASS.

Vladmir Poutine a multiplié dimanche les comparaisons entre la Seconde Guerre mondiale et le conflit en Ukraine dans ses vœux du 8 mai assurant notamment que « comme en 1945 la victoire sera à nous ».

De son côté le président ukrainien Volodymyr Zelensky a accusé son homologue russe d’avoir « oublié tout ce qui était important pour les vainqueurs » de 1945.

Le « mal est de retour » en Europe « dans un uniforme différent sous des slogans différents mais avec le même objectif » a déclaré M. Zelensky dans un discours de commémoration de la fin du conflit mondial en Europe comparant l’invasion de son pays par la Russie à l’agression des États européens par l’Allemagne nazie.

Il a fustigé dans un message vidéo dimanche soir « de violents bombardements » dans plusieurs régions ukrainiennes dont un ayant entraîné la mort de « 60 civils » samedi dans une école de Bilogorivka dans la région de Louhansk « comme si ce n’était pas le 8 mai aujourd’hui comme si demain n’était pas le 9 alors que le maître mot devrait être la paix pour tous les gens normaux ».

PHOTO MINISTÈRE UKRAINIEN DES SITUATIONS D’URGENCE VIA REUTERS Une école du village de Bilogorivka a été la cible d’une frappe russe samedi.

Le secrétaire général de l’ONU Antonio Guterres s’est dit « horrifié » par le bombardement selon son porte-parole.

Le gouverneur de la région de Louhansk Serguiï Gaïdaï avait expliqué dimanche matin à la télévision en langue russe Current Time TV qu’« il y avait au total 90 personnes » sur place au moment de la frappe. « 27 ont été sauvées » avait-il ajouté précisant que la température avait été très élevée après l’explosion qui a « complètement soufflé » l’école.

Déconvenues

La Russie n’a toutefois jusqu’à présent pu revendiquer le contrôle complet que d’une ville d’importance Kherson (sud) et l’offensive militaire que nombre d’experts prédisaient comme fulgurante a été marquée par des déconvenues notamment logistiques.

Après avoir échoué aux portes de Kyiv face à des forces ukrainiennes plus motivées que prévu et armées par les Occidentaux l’état-major russe a dû revoir ses objectifs à la baisse en resserrant l’offensive sur l’est et le sud du pays.

« L’ennemi ne cesse pas ses opérations offensives […] afin d’établir un contrôle total sur les régions de Donetsk de Louhansk et de Kherson et de maintenir le couloir terrestre entre ces territoires et la Crimée occupée » par la Russie depuis 2014 a averti l’état-major de l’armée ukrainienne.

Il a précisé que dans la région de Donetsk les troupes russes avaient poursuivi leurs attaques autour de Lyman Popasniansky Severodonetsk et Avdiivka et que les militaires ukrainiens se sont retirés de la ville de Popasna désormais en ruines pour occuper de « meilleures positions ».

Le ministère russe de la Défense a par ailleurs revendiqué dimanche la destruction du « poste de commandement d’une brigade mécanisée » ukrainienne dans la région de Kharkiv (nord-est) de même que du « centre de communication de l’aérodrome militaire de Chervonoglinskoye » dans le sud-ouest.

À Marioupol port du sud-est ukrainien quasi entièrement sous contrôle russe les militaires ukrainiens qui résistent toujours dans l’immense aciérie Azovstal ont exclu de se rendre. « Capituler n’est pas une option car notre vie n’intéresse pas la Russie. Nous laisser en vie ne lui importe pas » a déclaré Ilya Samoïlenko un officier du renseignement.

« Plus de civils dans l’aciérie »

À Zaporijjia (sud-est) 174 civils certains avec de jeunes enfants sont arrivés dimanche soir à bord de huit bus « depuis l’enfer de Marioupol » a écrit sur Twitter la coordinatrice humanitaire des Nations unies pour l’Ukraine Osnat Lubrani. Une quarantaine d’évacués provenaient de l’aciérie Azovstal.

PHOTO ALEXEI ALEXANDROV ASSOCIATED PRESS Les galeries de l’aciérie d’Azovstal abritent les derniers défenseurs de Marioupol.

Selon ses dernières informations « il n’y a plus de civils » dans l’aciérie a-t-elle indiqué à l’AFP ajoutant cependant ne pas « être en mesure de le vérifier ».

Des travailleurs humanitaires ont escorté des personnes âgées y compris une vieille dame en fauteuil roulant vers un centre d’accueil.

« Nous espérions tous les jours une évacuation » a déclaré Vladymyr Babeush 41 ans un évacué d’Azovstal qui travaillait dans l’usine. « Et maintenant nous avons fini d’attendre. Nous sommes tellement reconnaissants envers toutes les personnes impliquées ».

Un autre évacué Dmytro 17 ans s’est dit « très fatigué » après dix-sept heures de bus. « Mais je suis heureux parce qu’il y a de l’air frais et que je suis en Ukraine » a-t-il ajouté.

Samedi déjà M. Zelensky avait lancé : « Nous avons évacué les civils d’Azovstal » citant le chiffre de 300 personnes exfiltrées. « Nous préparons désormais la seconde phase […] : les blessés et le personnel médical. »

Selon Ievguenia Tytarenko une infirmière militaire dont le mari membre du régiment Azov est toujours dans l’usine Azovstal « de nombreux soldats sont dans un état grave. Ils sont blessés et n’ont pas de médicaments ». « La nourriture et l’eau manquent aussi ».

« Nos unités dans la zone de l’usine d’Azovstal continuent d’être bloquées » a relevé dimanche l’état-major ukrainien évoquant des « opérations d’assaut russes » avec « le soutien de l’artillerie et des tirs de chars ».

Sevrage du pétrole russe

Les puissances occidentales ont par ailleurs renouvelé leur soutien à l’Ukraine.

Le Royaume-Uni a annoncé dimanche soir des interdictions d’exportation visant l’industrie russe et la hausse de tarifs douaniers notamment sur le palladium et le platine.

Le G7 réuni virtuellement dimanche a décidé un sevrage « progressif » du pétrole russe. « Le G7 tout entier s’est engagé aujourd’hui à interdire ou supprimer progressivement les importations de pétrole russe » a annoncé la Maison-Blanche dans un communiqué. Cette décision « va porter un coup dur à la principale artère irriguant l’économie de Poutine et le priver des revenus dont il a besoin pour financer sa guerre ».

Au niveau de l’Union européenne des négociations se poursuivront en début de semaine entre États membres pour lever les obstacles au projet d’embargo européen sur le pétrole russe freiné par la Hongrie.

The Met Gala Vogue's annual celebration of fearless fashion was held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York on Monday night. It's a big night for fashion and celebrities which include a number of athletes. Tom Brady Steph Curry Russell Westbrook Simone Biles Carmelo Anthony and other major sports stars have been invited in the past.

The theme for 2024 was ""Garden of Time"" to celebrate the opening of the ""Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion"" exhibit at the Met. Let's see how this year's chosen athlete-stars (the gala is by invitation only) interpreted that theme.

It seems fitting to start with Angel Reese the college basketball star who was drafted by the Chicago Sky in late April and is currently one of the biggest stars on the planet. She celebrated her 22nd birthday on Monday by making her Met Gala debut in a stunning low-cut seafoam green gown adorned with an ostrich feather tutu and embroidered tulle.

The most talked-about look of the night came from Ben Simmons. He's still playing for the Brooklyn Nets (though you're forgiven if you hadn't noticed) but since they're not in the playoffs he was free to attend. He came solo wearing a black suit and black coat with panels of plaid fabric at the top and a vine down the side. The outfit wasn't bad but his literal interpretation of the ""Garden of Time"" theme involved a clock briefcase.

The entrepreneur and reality TV star was one of the celebrities who roasted the NFL legend on the Netflix special but was greeted with boos from the audience in attendance Sunday at the Kia Forum near Los Angeles.

Host Kevin Hart introduced Kardashian and as the Kardashians star took the podium she thanked the comedian and paused after the initial cheers. The cheers then turned to boos prompting Kardashian to say “All right all right all right.”

To ease the audience Hart is then heard saying “Whoa! Whoa!”

In the edited version Kardashian takes the stage and thanks Hart for introducing her. Netflix then cuts to a wide shot where Kardashian starts her bit taking a jab at Hart.

Kardashian concentrated her jokes on Brady who she was once rumored to be dating.

“I’m really here tonight for Tom. I wasn’t going to come tonight but since I’m not here as Tom’s date there’s still a good chance I might” she joked.

Kardashian delivered another joke likening Brady’s appearance to her stepdad Caitlyn Jenner.

“I do know it would’ve never worked out” Kardashian said of a relationship with Brady. “An ex-athlete high cheekbones silky hair. … You remind me too much of my stepdad now.”

A meme showing “the evolution of Tom Brady” appeared on screen showing the transformation of Brady’s physical appearance and ending up looking like Jenner.

Kardashian continued: “Part of me thinks you would want to entrust me just to try on my clothes. I know the transition from the NFL must’ve been really hard but I think my stepdad is a great example for you. She’s one of the best athletes in the world who proved you could do anything in this next chapter in your life.

Are We Not Aroused?,"Watching the red carpet at Monday night’s Met Gala I couldn’t help but recall a prediction I’d heard from Emily Kirkpatrick who writes the Substack newsletter “I <3 Mess.” She’d told me recently that before the end of 2024 it’s possible that “someone is going to show up fully nude on a red carpet.”

That didn’t happen at this year’s gala but it got very close as Doja Cat — who appeared earlier this year at the Grammy Awards in what was called “the most naked dress ever” — presented at the Met Gala in a long clinging soaking wet transparent and entirely revealing white T-shirt by the label Vetements.

Near-nudity is everywhere at least on celebrities and the celebrity adjacent. Bianca Censori Kanye West’s 29 year-old partner wandered around Paris wearing a cropped jacket with sheer pantyhose and seemingly nothing on underneath her modesty preserved only by the stockings’ single center seam. Julia Fox attended a fashion launch with three silver medallions covering her private parts under a long — and frequently parted — trench coat.

Josu Cuesta a former pupil at Amor Misericordioso is standing in the gravel car park that used to be his playground.

The school name has changed since but in 1992 it was the place he started hearing whispers about an exceptional talent on the other side at the neighbouring Jakintza primary.

The plaster obscured their view but it fuelled the imagination of what existed in this other world. Cuesta then 10 years old was regaled by tales of the boy’s majesty with a football to the extent he and his friends would climb to catch a glimpse of the action on the unusual green cement pitch.

A few months later Cuesta received a knock on the door from his neighbour the president of the local youth team Antiguoko inviting him to join training.

“There he was” Cuesta tells The Athletic recalling that moment with the same boyish thrill 32 years later.

“I saw for the first time that boy who was talked about so much: Mikel Arteta.

“The things he did with the ball were already so advanced while the rest of us still had a hard time.

“After that first day I didn’t want to return to the level I saw in that training. They only convinced me to come back by telling me that everyone was a year older than me including Mikel.”

Arteta fifth left back row and Cuesta sixth left back row (Josu Cuesta/Antiguoko)

His old school Amor Misericordioso translates as “merciful love” but there was little of that when it came to competition with Arteta.

On the other side of Heriz Pasealekua lies the next reference point in Arteta’s footballing journey. Elizbarrutiko Seminarioa a catholic church which tended to the sick and looks over the entire western bank of the city was the backdrop of Arteta’s first experiences of structured football.

A hilly road leads to a group of kids playing football on two pitches inside a cage underneath a Soviet-like building in its brutalist granite design.

Ten 20-metre-high concrete cylinders support a panoramic wall of windows that look out over San Sebastian the coast shaped like a horseshoe.

“This was where we first played for Antiguoko” says Mikel Yanguas who is taking The Athletic on a tour of Arteta’s childhood.

Yanguas spent five years with Arteta at their local team before signing for Barcelona with him at 15 along with Jon Alvarez who is now a first-team physiotherapist at the Catalan club.

Yanguas works in finance now and lives in a rural town further down the coast but his face lights up as he stands in the car park which used to house another two pitches.

“I was from a school in the old town but Antiguoko did not have its own ground and decided to collaborate with other schools so six or seven schools travelled here to train” Yanguas says.

“It is my first time coming back here but I can still picture Mikel with the exact same hair. He was small but very agile and technical and he always knew which pass to play rather than dribbling.

“We used to play another popular sport here which is Basque pelota. Rather than using a racquet we used only our hand to hit this really hard ball against the big wall. Your hands would be red by the end!

“Mikel was good at every sport. He was good at ping pong too!”

Arteta’s sporting prowess led to him attending Real Club Tenis de San Sebastian the city’s main tennis club situated at the very end of the Ondarreta strip — the area that lies below Antiguo.

Next door there is a Wimbledon-themed pub packed with artefacts but it was not Arteta’s first taste of London as it was only built in 1998.

Jon Castellano and Jose Luis Jimenez are still coaching at the club which now boasts 500 members from the age of four upwards but they remember a 10-year-old Arteta starting what could have been a fruitful tennis journey.

“At his age group he was at a high level. There were about 12 or 13 boys in each age group and he was in the top few” says Castellano.

“He had great coordination in everything he did. He had all the shots and was a tactical player because he was small.

“But he did not play in the competition groups as he only trained on Monday and Friday. The weekends were for football.”

The club produced Lara Arruabarrena who reached No 52 in the world in 2017 and also developed Ane Mintegi Del Olmo who became the girls’ singles champion at Wimbledon in 2021.

Could they have had another professional on their books with Arteta?

“When he was 13 he had to choose tennis or football — I think he made the right decision!” says Castellano laughing.

“His temperament is better for team sports. When he was young his personality could be difficult. When he made a mistake he would get very angry with himself as he was very competitive.”

Cuesta remembers the same spirit bubbling under when playing with Antiguoko — or when they used to tease Arteta that he looked like a famous Spanish bullfighter Fran Rivera.

“I was surprised by how competitive it was” says Cuesta. “From a very young age he was a born winner. He didn’t like losing — not even when we were riding a bike.

“One day we were racing up the hill to the Igueldo lighthouse and I cheated. I said ‘My bike has broken’ and when everyone stopped I started climbing like crazy to the finish line.

“Just to see Mikel angry behind me was worth it.”

Cuesta remembers their first game against Real Sociedad the club ubiquitous throughout the city with flags hanging out of windows on virtually every block of flats.

Antiguoko hosted the professional club at their home ground in Berio. It is a very different complex now with its kempt gardens seven-a-side astroturf cage and 11-a-side pitch underneath the mountains behind the far goal.

When Arteta was involved in that famous game for Antiguoko he played where the flower beds now lie. Back then it was gravel.

“He was by far the best player of all that day even though he did not score” says Cuesta.

“I think Yanguas scored two goals that day but we played a 3-4-1-2 with Mikel as the No 10. He could step on the ball and do anything even though it was a gravel field.

“There is a videotape I have seen 100 times of the game. I remember he did a roulette on the left wing controlled the ball and passed it between the defence. Mikel was different from the rest.”

His coach Roberto Montiel recalls another story from that day which helped put Antiguoko on the map as a talent hub for Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao.

Arteta “slalomed” past the entire team and if he slotted home he would finish as top goalscorer. Instead he squared the ball to his team-mate to tap it in.

“I coached (Andoni) Iraola and (Xabi) Alonso’s team who were a year older but I watched Arteta from the very first day” says Oscar Landa.

“As soon as he arrived we moved him up to play with Alonso. We finished the competition in first position ahead of Bilbao and Sociedad — and Mikel was clearly the best.

“He was very intelligent. When you were thinking ‘do that’ he did it.”

Arteta became close friends with his team-mates Yosu Martinez Alvaro Parra Alvaro Vazquez Jaime Sobrino and Cuesta. They had their first parties together as teenagers and attended the San Sebastian festival together as one of their first outings.

They travelled all across Europe playing tournaments against professional teams and invariably came out on top. The parents including the Artetas also travelled which helped forge a lasting bond.

Cuesta treasures a picture from a tournament in France where Arteta can be seen in the thick of a pre-match war cry.

“We used to make: ‘Aupa Antiguiko aupa!’ which was led by the captain Aitor Esnaola.

“Mikel did not have the armband but he was already a coach when he was 12 years old. He directed and saw holes where no one saw them. He gesticulated to the rest of us how and where to stand.”

Now members of that Antiguo team have a WhatsApp group called ‘Legends’ in which they regularly discuss Arteta’s achievements with Arsenal. He is not part of it but Cuesta’s last contact with his old friend had special significance.

“Mikel and I lost contact due to distance but the day my father (Jesus Mari) died he wrote to me 20 years after not having contact” says Cuesta.

“I would like to thank him again as I was very excited to see his message. Our years together were wonderful.”

Yanguas was a very different character to Arteta. He was tall angular the goalscorer; Arteta was slight wily the conductor.

Both attracted the attention of Bilbao when they were 14 though.

“For a whole year I used to have lunch in his house with his mother and then we would be picked up in a taxi to go to Bilbao training” says Yanguas.

“We did that four days a week leaving after school and getting back late at night. We had a fantastic coach in (Jose Luis) Mendilibar (current Olympiakos manager) who was very close to the players.”

But it got to April of that season and they had not signed with Bilbao. Yanguas and Arteta were picked to play for the Gipuzkoa select team in a tournament against Real Madrid and Barcelona.

Barcelona contacted their parents and soon the boys found themselves in an office seeking agent representation to help make their dream move a reality.

Barca made a professional pitch to the parents about La Masia and how they would nurture their sons but had Arteta chosen Bilbao it is felt by those involved at the time the deal for the other two players may have fallen through.

Arteta was the gem and he excelled in Barcelona. Yanguas meanwhile desperately struggled.

“It was really difficult for me. I couldn’t sleep so I was going to school the next day very tired and then had to try to play” says Yanguas.

“I was so homesick I cried a lot in my room. I only stayed there for one year because it was a really bad experience for me. I never told Mikel about how upset I was as I am quite closed with my feelings.

“It was different for Mikel. He was very open and spoke a lot with everyone. He had a better ability to form relationships. His mentality was very strong. You could see even then that he was 100 per cent convinced about his capacity to play and succeed.”

Yanguas also spent hours with Arteta at a packed La Concha beach — where Arteta’s uncle was a keen surfer — when the tide was out.

His father still lives in Antiguo but Arteta’s only time playing senior football in Spain came during an ill-fated six months at his boyhood club Sociedad in 2004.

He felt at odds with the manager and his role within the team and quickly took control of his career asking for a way out. Perhaps it is why players like Alonso and Iraola seem more present in the minds of locals as they rose into the first teams of Bilbao and Sociedad spending a significant part of their careers there.

Arteta visits Antiguoko every so often to help inspire the next generation but his transfer was the first building block in helping Antiguoko establish the facility they now have.

Since their foundation in 1982 40 players have become professionals with Ander Barrenetxea and Sociedad captain Martin Zubimendi another two of their alumni.

Thoughts of creating a senior team still linger but Bilbao and Sociedad remain in a tug-of-war over Antiguoko’s pipeline with the former currently enjoying a 10-year agreement for first refusal on the best talents.

Bilbao have already agreed deals for four players to join next season and their regional youth scout Aitor Ayerza is in attendance at Antiguoko’s training as part of their deal gives them unlimited access to track the players closely.

There are high hopes for 15-year-old Inigo Sainz De Lecinana another skilful midfielder who committed to Bilbao in January.

He is playing two years above his age group at times but will there ever be a talent that caught the imagination of Landa and Montiel quite like Arteta? They simply laugh and shake their heads.

Very little is known about the history of the dancing baby but according to Know Your Meme the baby’s source file was released in 1996 as part of a Character Studio package. Character Studio was 3D rendering software within Autodesk’s 3DS Max software.

In a recent video for BuzzFeed Michael Girard explained that he wrote the code for Dancing Baby as a sample file and LucasArts’ Ron Lussier played around with different variations of the baby.

While the baby began to spread via email Girard cites the Ally McBeal show for popularizing animation.

The Dancing Baby has now been remastered in stunning HD to become NFT. The original creators of the GIF joined forces with Vienna-based design studio HFA-Studio to further cement the meme in Internet history.

“Over 25 years after Dancing Baby first went viral we’re releasing a digitally restored 1/1 high-definition softcore artwork by the original creators like NFT so Dancing Baby can shake their hips forever.” 

said HFA-Studio

The original Dancing Baby NFT is part of the larger “Dancing Baby Collection” which features six additional versions of the artwork created by other artists.

NFTs are no longer popular

The popularity of NFTs has decreased somewhat in recent months. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the NFT bubble could be about to burst as NFT sales fell 92% from their peak in September 2021 while the number of active wallets fell 88% from their peak. peak in November 2021.

Fortune reported similar volatility in March 2022: the average price of an NFT fell by around $4800 and total cumulative daily sales fell by $134 million in just a few weeks.

The Dancing Baby is not the first internet meme to appear on the blockchain: the creator of Nyan Cat remastered the colorful feline for coin early last year.

In a world where nostalgia is becoming an increasingly valuable commodity to cash in on it seems the creators of some of the most memorable early internet memes are now trying to do the same with NFTs.",,,,,,

Institutional ethical committee approval was obtained from the Ethical Review Board of the University Hospitals Leuven (reference number: S57587). Informed consent was not required as patient-specific information was anonymized. The study plan and report followed the recommendations of Schwendicke et al.23 for reporting on artificial intelligence in dental research.

Dataset

A sample of 132 CBCT scans (264 sinuses75 females and 57 males mean age 40 years) from 2013 to 2021 with different scanning parameters was collected (Table 1). Inclusion criteria were patients with permanent dentition and maxillary sinus with/without mucosal thickening (shallow > 2 mm moderate > 4 mm) and/or with semi-spherical membrane in one of the walls24. Scans having dental restorations orthodontic brackets and implants were also included. The exclusion criteria were patients with a history of trauma sinus surgery and presence of pathologies affecting its contour.

Table 1 CBCT scanning parameters. Full size table

The Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) files of the CBCT images were exported anonymously. Dataset was further randomly divided into three subsets: (1) training set (n = 83 scans) for training of the CNN model based on the ground truth; (2) validation set (n = 19 scans) for evaluation and selection of the best model; (3) testing set (n = 30 scans) for testing the model performance by comparison with ground truth.

Ground truth labelling

The ground truth datasets for training and testing of the CNN model were labelled by semi-automatic segmentation of the sinus using Mimics Innovation Suite (version 23.0 Materialise N.V. Leuven Belgium). Initially a custom threshold leveling was adjusted between [− 1024 to − 200 Hounsfield units (HU)] to create a mask of the air (Fig. 1a). Subsequently the region of interest (ROI) was isolated from the rest of the surrounding structures. A manual delineation of the bony contours was performed using eclipse and livewire function and all contours were checked in coronal axial and sagittal orthogonal planes (Fig. 1b). To avoid any inconsistencies in the ROI of different images the segmentation region was limited to the early start of the sinus ostium from the sinus side before continuation into the infundibulum (Fig. 1b). Finally the edited mask of each sinus was exported separately as a standard tessellation language (STL) file. The segmentation was performed by a dentomaxillofacial radiologist (NM) with seven years of experience and subsequently re-assessed by two other radiologists (KFV&RJ) with 15 and 25 years of experience respectively.

CNN model architecture and training

Two 3D U-Net architecture were used25 both of which consisted of 4 encoder and 3 decoder blocks 2 convolutions with a kernel size of 3 × 3 × 3 followed by a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation and group normalization with 8 feature maps26. Thereafter max pooling with kernel size 2 × 2 × 2 by strides of two was applied after each encoder allowing reduction of the resolution with a factor 2 in all dimensions. Both networks were trained as a binary classifier (0 or 1) with a weighted Binary Cross Entropy Loss:

$${L}_{BCE}={y}_{n}*log\left({p}_{n}\right)+\left(1-{y}_{n}\right)*log\left(1-{p}_{n}\right)$$

for each voxel n with ground truth value \({y}_{n}\) = 0 or 1 and the predicted probability of the network = \({p}_{n}\)

A two-step pre-processing of the training dataset was applied. First all scans were resampled at the same voxel size. Thereafter to overcome the graphics processing unit (GPU) memory limitations the full-size scan was down sampled to a fixed size.

The first 3D U-Net was used to provide roughly low-resolution segmentation for proposing 3D patches and cropped only those which belonged to the sinus. Later those relevant patches were transferred to the second 3D U-Net where they were individually segmented and combined to create the full resolution segmentation map. Finally binarization was applied and only the largest connected part was kept followed by application of a marching cubes algorithm on the binary image. The resultant mesh was smoothed to generate a 3D model (Fig. 2).

The model parameters were optimized with ADAM27 (an optimization algorithm for training deep learning models) having an initial learning rate of 1.25e−4. During training random spatial augmentations (rotation scaling and elastic deformation) were applied. The validation dataset was used to define the early stopping which indicates a saturation point of the model where no further improvement can be noticed by the training set and more cases will lead to data overfitting. The CNN model was deployed to an online cloud-based platform called virtual patient creator (creator.relu.eu Relu BV Version October 2021) where users could upload DICOM dataset and obtain an automatic segmentation of the desired structure.

Testing of AI pipeline

The testing of the CNN model was performed by uploading DICOM files from the test set to the virtual patient creator platform. The resulting automatic segmentation (Fig. 3) could be later downloaded in DICOM or STL file format. For clinical evaluation of the automatic segmentation the authors developed the following classification criteria: A—perfect segmentation (no refinement was needed) B—very good segmentation (refinements without clinical relevance slight over or under segmentation in regions other than the maxillary sinus floor) C—good segmentation (refinements that have some clinical relevance slight over or under segmentation in the maxillary sinus floor region) D—deficient segmentation (considerable over or under segmentation independent of the sinus region with necessary repetition) and E—negative (the CNN model could not predict anything). Two observers (NM and KFV) evaluated all the cases followed by an expert consensus (RJ). In cases where refinements were required the STL file was imported into Mimics software and edited using the 3D tools tab. The resulting segmentation was denoted as refined segmentation.

Evaluation metrics

The evaluation metrics2829 are outlined in Table 2. The comparison of outcome amongst the ground truth and automatic and refined segmentation was performed by the main observer on the whole testing set. A pilot of 10 scans were tested at first which showed a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.985 ± 004 Intersection over union (IoU) of 0.969 ± 0.007 and 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD) of 0.204 ± 0.018 mm. Based on these findings the sample size of the testing set was increased up to 30 scans according to the central limit theorem (CLT)30.

Table 2 Metrics used for assessing accuracy and consistency. Full size table

Time efficiency

The time required for the semi-automatic segmentation was calculated starting from opening the DICOM files in Mimics software till export of the STL file. For automatic segmentation the algorithm automatically calculated the time required to have a full resolution segmentation. The time for the refined segmentation was calculated similarly to that of semi-automatic segmentation and later added to the initial automatic segmentation time. The average time for each method was calculated based on the testing set sample.

Accuracy

A voxel-wise comparison amongst ground truth automatic and refined segmentation of the testing set was performed by applying a confusion matrix with four variables: true positive (TP) true negative (TN) false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) voxels. Based on the aforementioned variables the accuracy of the CNN model was assessed according to the metrics mentioned in Table 2.

Consistency

Once the CNN model is trained it is deterministic; hence it was not evaluated for consistency. For illustration one scan was uploaded twice on the platform and the resultant STLs were compared. Intra- and inter-observer consistency were calculated for the semi-automatic and refined segmentation. The intra-observer reliability of the main observer was calculated by re-segmenting 10 scans from the testing set with different protocols. For the inter-observer reliability two observers (NM and KFV) performed the needed refinements then the STL files were compared with each other.

Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed with RStudio: Integrated Development Environment for R version 1.3.1093 (RStudio PBC Boston MA). Mean and standard deviation was calculated for all evaluation metrics. A paired-sample t-test was performed with a significance level (p < 0.05) to compare timing required for semi-automatic and automatic segmentation of the testing set.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvd3RvZ2Vlay5jb20vMTE3MTkxL2dvb2dsZS1jaHJvbWUtd2lsbC1hdXRvbWF0aWNhbGx5LWNoYW5nZS15b3VyLXN0b2xlbi1wYXNzd29yZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google Chrome Will Automatically Change Your Stolen Passwords,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvd3RvZ2Vlay5jb20vMTE3MTkxL2dvb2dsZS1jaHJvbWUtd2lsbC1hdXRvbWF0aWNhbGx5LWNoYW5nZS15b3VyLXN0b2xlbi1wYXNzd29yZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdG93YXJkc2RhdGFzY2llbmNlLmNvbS9jYW4td2Vhay1sYWJlbGluZy1yZXBsYWNlLWh1bWFuLWxhYmVsZWQtZGF0YS1iZmQwNjc2NmE4MTbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Can Weak Labeling Replace Human-Labeled Data? | by Walid Amamou,"Can Weak Labeling Replace Human-Labeled Data?

Liddell averaged 12 points a game for the Lady Eagles in her senior season helping get Horn Lake to the state 6A quarterfinals before dropping a 57-44 decision to Clinton ending a 21-4 season under coach Darryl Partee. Liddell had seven points for the Lady Eagles in that contest.

Partee told LIddell she grew the past year into a strong leader for the team.

“You became a true floor general and a soldier” Partee said. “More and more I saw you become the coach on the floor and become more like your coach.”

Liddell was also part of the first Magnolia State All-Star Series game played this spring at the conclusion of the regular season.

SAU Tech was this year’s NJCAA Region 2 Women’s Basketball champions with a 17-8 record. The Lady Rockets defeated North Arkansas 67-52 in the region finals. They are coached by Aramie Brooks who was the school’s interim coach after a coaching change in the 2019-20 season. He was later elevated to be the permanent head coach and has been there since.

New analysis has revealed that Lee On The Solent in Hampshire has the highest driving test pass rate among women whilst Aberdeen South (Cove) has the highest for men.

The study by A-Plan Insurance examined the pass rate percentage of major driving test centres in the UK – those that have conducted at least 1000 tests since April 2020 – to determine the one with the highest pass rate for women and men.

Lee On The Solent comes out on top for women as the test centre with the highest female pass rate. This test centre has an average pass rate of 67% when analysing the passes of all tests from April 2020 to June 2021 – of 1649 tests for women taken 1107 were passed.

In comparison Aberdeen South (Cove) has the highest pass rate for males out of all test centres in the UK. The average pass rate is 69%.

Placing second is Llantrisant Wales with a female pass rate of 66% - out of 762 tests conducted for women 507 were passed. Lee On The Solent has the second-highest pass rate for males at 68%. 1667 tests were taken in this area for men and 1147 of these passed.

Newbury (Hambridge Lane) has the third-highest pass rates for female driving tests out of all test centres in the UK. 814 tests were conducted for women with 527 being passed making the average pass rate 64.7%. Dorchester has seen a 68% pass rate for male tests making this area the UK test centre with the third highest pass rate for men.

Chichester’s average driving test pass rate for women is 64.5% placing it just below Newbury (Hambridge Lane). Yeovil comes in as the test centre with the fourth-highest driving test pass rate for men at 68.5%.

Aberdeen South (Cove) at 64.2% pass rate for women comes in as having the fifth-highest overall in the UK. Chichester has an average pass rate for males of 66.8%.

Yeovil Somerset has the sixth-highest pass rate for female driving tests with a rate of 63.5%. 1145 tests were conducted here and 728 passed. Llantrisant in Wales has a pass rate of 66.7% for males and out of 608 tests taken 406 passed.

Winchester ranks as the UK test centre with the seventh-highest pass rate for women at 63.5% whilst Darlington has the highest rate for males at 66.7%.

Sevenoaks in Kent has a pass rate of 63.5% for women; out of 838 tests taken 532 were passes putting it eighth. Durham has an average pass rate of 66% for male driving tests and out of 1037 tests taken 684 were passes.

Northwich places as the ninth area with the highest female pass rate for driving tests in the UK at 63.2% while Hereford ranks for male pass rates with an average of 65.9%.

The areas with the tenth highest pass rates are Dorchester with 62.5% for females and Livingston with 65.7% for males.

In total between April 2020 and June 2021 there were 355348 male tests taken and 337161 female tests conducted.

Commenting on the figures a spokesperson for A-Plan Insurance said: “This analysis highlights the geographical disparity of pass rates for men and women in the UK.

""A driving test is often a stressful time in someone’s life and can be both exciting and daunting.

""The considerable difference for men and women at some of the UK’s major test centres is fascinating. It will be interesting to see if these differences become wider stay consistent or balance out in the future.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vbW9uZXltdW5jaC5jb20vZ29sZC1wcmljZS1wcmVkaWN0aW9ucy1mb3ItMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gold Price Predictions for 2022,"In the previous trading session MCX Gold made a high of 51538 and closed at 51343 (+444). A question is is it moving upward?

To identify uptrend:

There are two hurdles to continuing the uptrend. It should break out the 5th May high or settle above the control line.

According to the above chart Gold is forming a bullish flag pattern. And we’re waiting for a breakout of the flag pattern. This breakout will skyrocket the gold price and we can see 6400+ points of bullish movement here. Long-term target for gold 58000 – 60000.

Gold downtrend confirmation:



But if gold breaks the support trendline (invalidation) then a downtrend may start. And if it happens I will update you asap.

At present intraday traders can keep buying for targets of 51500 – 51800+ levels.

The Reconstruction Finance Corp. (RFC) was an agency authorized by the U.S. government to loan money to assist the nation's ailing banks after the stock market crash of 1929 and during the Great Depression that followed.

Congress created the RFC in 1932 with a limited mandate to issue emergency loans to banks railroads and farmers threatened with insolvency. Its scope quickly expanded and it soon began lending money to state and local governments to finance public infrastructure projects. It outlived the Great Depression and later helped finance industries that were key to the nation's role in World War II.

The RFC was not fully abolished until 1957.

Key Takeaways The Reconstruction Finance Corp. was created to stabilize the nation's banks railroad industry and farms during the economic turmoil that marked the early years of the Great Depression.

Its role expanded greatly especially during the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt as it began funding local infrastructure projects and lending money to small businesses.

Later the RFC had an important role in funding the nation's preparation for its entrance into World War II.

The RFC's unusual status as a quasi-independent agency made it useful to President Roosevelt who could funnel money to public projects through it without Congressional oversight.

The RFC was scaled down and finally abolished in the years after World War II.

Understanding the Reconstruction Finance Corp. (RFC)

Congress created the RFC primarily to shore up the nation's banks which were collapsing under the strain of panic withdrawals from their customers as the Great Depression took hold.



It was intended to stay in business for only 10 years but the RFC continued and even expanded throughout the 1930s and the 1940s.

Soon after its creation the RFC expanded its lending activities beyond the nation's banks railroads and farms. It ultimately made loans to state and local governments as well as small businesses. When World War II broke out the RFC developed eight subsidiaries to focus on financing industrial production related to the nation's wartime needs.

History of the Reconstruction Finance Corp. (RFC)

The Emergency Relief Act created in the summer of 1932 broadened the agency's scope and power. It allowed the RFC to extend loans to local and state public works as well as farmers and small businesses.

In its initial years under President Herbert Hoover the RFC made little use of its expanded powers. After Franklin D. Roosevelt took office and the New Deal went into effect the agency sought more vigorously to support the recovery effort.

The RFC expanded even further during World War II to provide financing for the construction and operation of war plants and even loans to Allied foreign governments.

The original concept was that the RFC would be a non-political autonomous agency. During its earliest years the concept held.

However as the RFC continually expanded and assumed the hefty responsibility of doling out massive sums of money it became more subject to accusations of political favoritism in its decisions on loans.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) which protects bank deposits and the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) which regulates the financial markets are both products of Roosevelt-era reforms.

Beginnings

The bank panic was one of the symptoms of the Great Depression which began with the collapse of the stock market in 1929 and would continue until 1939. At the time America had more than 24000 independent banks most of them serving small communities and rural areas.

One bank after another collapsed as their customers lined up and withdrew their savings until the vaults were empty and the banks closed. The remaining customers lost their life savings. The panic spread from town to town.

The Federal Reserve had been created in 1913 specifically to prevent this type of crisis by providing emergency loans to banks. But only nationally-chartered banks were required to be Fed members. State-chartered banks including most of those small local banks were not members.

The Hoover Administration

In 1932 the Reconstruction Finance Corp. was created by Congress with the backing of President Herbert Hoover. Its mission was to provide emergency loans to three key sectors of the economy: banks railroads and farm crops.

The U.S. Treasury initially provided $500 million in funds to be distributed by the RFC.

The New Deal

The scope of the RFC and its funding expanded enormously after the election of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Its independence was a key benefit of the RFC from the politician's viewpoint: Its spending did not require Congressional authorization and did not appear in the federal budget.

The agency began to loan money to state and local governments to fund state and local public projects and to pay for relief programs for the unemployed. Assistance to cash-strapped farmers was greatly increased.

As the Great Depression continued many homeowners defaulted on their mortgages. The banks fearing more defaults made it even more difficult to obtain a mortgage. In yet another expansion of RFC powers it was empowered to create the Federal National Mortgage Association to guarantee mortgages. That association still exists and is known as Fannie Mae.

The Small Business Administration was created to fill a gap left by the dissolution of the RFC. Its creation acknowledged the importance of small businesses to the U.S. economy and the difficulty of their owners in getting financing through the private banking system.

World War II

By 1940 U.S. involvement in World War II appeared inevitable. No fewer than eight subsidiaries were added to the RFC to finance the development of materials necessary to the war and to replace imported materials that had become unobtainable.

End of the Reconstruction Finance Corp.

Post-depression and post-war the work of the RFC began to wind down.

In 1948 Congress began a series of investigations of political corruption within the RFC. One accusation was that the RFC had granted a loan to a customer of Boeing Corp. in return for Boeing's support of President Harry S. Truman.

The Senate Committee on Banking and Currency mandated an immediate reorganization leading to a restructuring of the RFC in 1952.

Despite the effort to revamp the agency accusations of mismanagement continued to surround the RFC. Just one year after the restructuring Congress passed the RFC Liquidation Act.

The agency was defunded and its remaining functions were slowly transferred to other agencies. The Small Business Administration was created in part to fill a void in government lending to small businesses that the RFC's disappearance created.

In 1957 the all-but-defunct RFC was dismantled entirely.

Economic Review of the Reconstruction Finance Corp.

The Reconstruction Finance Corp. filled the role of lender of last resort that in later years has been held by the Federal Reserve. Although it had been created in 1913 the Federal Reserve did not have the ability to lend to state-chartered banks. Nor did banks then have federal insurance to guarantee their deposits.

It was those state-chartered banks that served America's small businesses farms and consumers. And about 9000 of them failed between 1930 and 1933 taking their depositors' money with them.

The RFC must get some credit for stopping that spiral of destruction and preventing the U.S. from an economic collapse. Its record however is still debated:

A near-fatal decision to publish the names of banks seeking loans from the RFC may have caused some to shun the agency's help for fear of causing panic withdrawals.

A requirement for collateral for some RFC loans may have deprived banks of much of the liquidity they could have used to stabilize and expand their operations.



What Was the Main Purpose of the Reconstruction Finance Corp.? The original mandate of the Reconstruction Finance Corp. was to make emergency loans to keep American banks railroads and farms afloat through the worst of the Great Depression. The scope of its activities expanded greatly over the years. During the Depression it lent money to state and local governments to fund public works projects. During World War II it took a key role in funding the expansion of U.S. military capability and even loaned money to foreign governments.



How Did the Reconstruction Finance Corp. Impact the Great Depression? You think the 2008-2009 financial crisis was bad? The unemployment rate hit 24.9% during the Great Depression. Nearly half of the nation's banks failed. Industrial production dropped by half. The downturn lasted for 10 years. The Reconstruction Finance Corp. seems to have kept some banks up and running through the worst years of the depression. It took on a far more substantial role after 1932 when President Roosevelt used it to funnel much-needed money into state and local government projects and ailing small businesses.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjkwbWluLmNvbS9wb3N0cy9jaGFybG90dGUtZmMtMS0wLWludGVyLW1pYW1pLXBsYXllci1yYXRpbmdzLWFuZHJlLXNoaW55YXNoaWtpLWRlYnV0LWdvYWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Charlotte FC 1-0 Inter Miami player ratings: Andre Shinyashiki debut goal delivers home win,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNvaW5yZXB1YmxpYy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8wNy9iYW5rLW9mLWFtZXJpY2EtYml0Y29pbi1pcy1ub3QtYS1wb3J0Zm9saW8tdmFyaWVnYXRvci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bank Of America: Bitcoin Is Not A Portfolio Variegator,"Bank of America has recently signified that Bitcoin might not prove to be the best choice for the folks.

Western sanctions on Russia were designed to isolate the country from the international financial system but the economic offensive has also left international traders who hold shares in Russian companies cut off from their assets.

As Russian forces pushed into Ukraine the US and the EU unleashed waves of measures against companies and individuals they alleged had close ties to Vladimir Putin’s regime.

Among the first moves were measures to stop Russian companies from raising money on overseas markets like London or New York.

These prompted an equally forceful response from Putin: capital controls that banned Russia-based institutions from transferring foreign currency abroad. This in effect froze their assets inside Russia.

With the opposing nations at what amounts to economic war foreign investors with investments in Russia seem “caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place” says Steven Hill a partner at law firm K&L Gates.

At the end of 2021 foreign investors held Russian equities worth $86bn according to data from the Moscow Exchange. But the introduction of sanctions left them with an uneasy choice: divest from the Russian market as some of the measures required; or — where permitted — hold on to their assets but face uncertainty over whether they could take control of them again.

Investors are already counting the cost to their portfolios. Russia’s biggest corporate names such as Gazprom VTB and TCS Group have been left holding assets worth a fraction of what they were in early February.

Moreover the war in Ukraine is a huge blow to the integration in recent years of Russian companies with western stock exchanges — mostly the London Stock Exchange but also the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.

Shares in the companies are often traded on overseas markets as depositary receipts a type of bank certificate that securitises the ownership of shares.

During the past two decades London has been the predominant market for Russian companies to raise money outside Moscow. Thirty-nine Russian companies have listed in London and raised $44bn since 2005 according to financial data researcher FactSet.

This trend slowed in 2014 after the peak of the commodities boom and the imposition of initial sanctions against Russia in response to its annexation of Crimea that year. Now though the war in Ukraine has dealt an all but terminal blow to the relationship.

When Ukraine was invaded. shares in Russian companies became immediately toxic and western sanctions give international shareholders little time to divest. Meanwhile banks were not only wary of breaking sanctions but also worried that counterparts would not be able to settle their deals or would be badly hit by volatile foreign exchange rates.

Faced with uncertainty and regulatory requirements to maintain an orderly market many exchanges suspended the shares of Russian-incorporated companies.

London home to the biggest cluster of Russian companies suspended 28 companies. Index compilers like FTSE Russell S&P Dow Jones and MSCI whose benchmarks are widely followed by fund managers removed affected stocks from their indices at a price of zero.

At the same time the Moscow Exchange shut for nearly a month when the war began.

When it reopened investors found a very different market. Foreign investors’ access was restricted. Activity had greatly declined making it harder to sell large blocks of shares. On the day the exchange restarted operations private investors accounted for nearly 60 per cent of the total volume of trades according to an exchange statement reported by Russian news agency Interfax.

The few other windows open to western investors have continued to close.

For example depositary receipts had been able to represent shares listed in Russia as their receipt issuers held the underlying shares in the local market. As banks worked through the implications of the sanctions some including BNY Mellon then allowed holders of Russian receipts to convert them into local shares in nearly 20 Russian firms. That would at least allow fund managers to hold the shares locally even if they were difficult to trade.

However Russia moved swiftly to clamp down on the practice passing laws to formally delist and terminate most overseas depositary receipts. To prevent a rush the central bank of Russia then limited the number of shares that depositary banks could convert defending its move as in the interests of financial stability.

Or as the central bank put it: “Such practice may result in a disproportionate increase in the supply of local stocks in the market which may have a significant impact on price and provoke a drop in stock prices.”

Russian companies could apply to the central bank for permission to keep their depositary receipt programmes but only a few have been successful. Gazprom once among the most actively traded shares on the LSE is terminating its London and Singapore receipts in May after its application was rejected.

The restrictions may not be permanent. At the end of April Russia’s deputy central bank governor Alexey Zabotkin indicated in a news conference that Russia will slowly ease capital controls when the market stabilises.

And the shares and the associated cash have not disappeared.

Euroclear the Belgium-based central securities depository has said its balance sheet increased by 80 per cent in the first quarter year-on-year to nearly €23bn. This it says is because it has been accumulating coupons dividends and redemptions from Russian companies but has been unable to pass them on to sanctioned parties.

Even so few are taking many chances with what’s left.

K&L Gates for example advises clients to take urgent steps to preserve information about their investments in case sanctions result in a devalued or even lost investment — and the matter goes to arbitration.

“Protecting foreign investment in Russia is likely to be a challenging exercise for the foreseeable future” it warns.",,,,,,,,,

It’ll hang there until the next time you need to towel off—unless it needs to be washed that is. But how often should you really change out your bath towel for a fresh one?

There’s a certain number of days to be mindful of before your towel becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. Plus using a fresh clean bath towel is not only good for your personal hygiene but for your overall health. Ahead find what experts have to say when it comes to how often you should change your bath towel.

This Is How Often You Should Change Out Your Bath Towel

According to Annie Chiu MD a board-certified dermatologist and founder of The Derm Institute there's a clear guidance on when to make the swap.

“Generally you should change your towels every three to four uses” she says. “This helps prevent the buildup of bacteria and odors.”

It’s important to stick to this clean towel schedule for a few reasons Chiu notes. Bacteria dead skin cells and excess oils from your skin can build up on wet towels. So when a dirty towel is used you run the risk of creating skin infections or exacerbating existing skin conditions like acne.

Factors That Affect When You Should Swap Out Your Towel

That said several factors can impact the length of time you keep a towel in your rotation.

How Smelly It Is

If a towel looks unclean or starts to smell before three uses you should change it sooner Chiu says.

How Often You Shower

On the flip side if you shower every day you might be able to use your towel a few more times before changing it.

How Much You Sweat

“However if your workout or job causes you to sweat a lot you should change your towel more frequently” she adds. “The same applies to those who live in humid climates—because towels may take longer to dry increasing the risk of bacterial growth and odor.”

Your Towel's Material

Your towel’s material can also come into play. Waffle weave towels for example tend to dry more quickly than typical terrycloth towels.

“Thanks to the waffle weave construction of our towels we have found that they do generally dry faster than a traditional cotton terry towel” explains Jason Gutierrez cofounder of textile company Geometry. “In our experience a quicker-drying towel lends itself to more uses between washes.”

Gutierrez estimates swapping out a waffle weave towel every seven to 10 days while also considering how often the towel is being used where and how it is stored in between uses and the humidity and temperature of the area where the towel is hung.

Pollutants in the Environment

“Factors such as exposure to pet dander smoke or outdoor pollutants can also affect towel cleanliness and may necessitate more frequent changes” say the product experts at bedding and linens company Cozy Earth.

When Should You Throw Away Towels?

After swapping towels in and out over a few years your bath towel may start to lose its softness fluff and absorbency. “If your towels no longer absorb water effectively and feel less soft and plush than they used to it may be time for replacements” say the experts at Cozy Earth. “Over time towels can lose their absorbency due to wear and tear or the buildup of detergent residue.”

Similarly if your towels are exposed to chlorine and sunlight that makes a difference in their longevity as do washing habits and how often you use them.

When properly cared for a typical towel's lifespan is about two years (less if they're heavily used more if they're mainly for display).

“Personally once my towel starts to show signs of wear such as fraying I know it has lived its life and it's time for a new one” says Gutierrez. “I have several Geometry waffle bath towels that have been in my towel rotation for years and are still going strong. They’re quite durable in terms of construction and functionality but like all textiles they do eventually wear out.”

Don't throw your towels away though! There's plenty you can do with them like donating them to animal shelters or turning them into cleaning rags.

The redeveloped complex at the corner of Front and Summer streets called The Uptown after a movie theater that was once there will be reserved for residents who are 55 and older. In total it will add 50 rental units to 10 that were in the structure before it was redeveloped.

Forty-two of them will be for low-income renters according to the project’s developer The Szanton Company.

The housing shortage that’s affecting all Maine communities is particularly serious in the midcoast making it harder for workers in the region to find places to live. Among other communities trying to build more housing is St. George where voters will decide next week whether to give away town-owned land to build new homes.

The new development in Bath which will have a grand opening on Wednesday joins another project that Bath Housing has been working to develop at 520 Centre St. in recent years.

The first phase of the Bath Housing project will bring 18 rental units for low-income residents and the second phase is expected to include an additional 24 units of single-bedroom rentals for a range of incomes according to Executive Director Debora Keller.

Any additional housing will go a long way to easing the crisis Keller said.

She noted that The Uptown will help preserve the historic Moses and Columbia Block buildings which were constructed in 1893 and redeveloped for the project after Bath Housing acquired the properties in 2019 and sold them in 2022 to The Szanton Company.

The buildings have also hosted shops the movie theater and a YMCA over the years and they will continue to maintain six retail spaces now that they’ve been redeveloped. Keller says the new housing option will make it easier for residents to live within walking distance of a number of downtown amenities.

“I just think this is one of the neatest housing projects I’ve seen in years” Keller said.

Rental prices on the apartments will range from $794 to $1495 per month depending on residents’ income according to The Szanton Company. Most of the units are one-bedroom apartments while six of them are two-bedrooms.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocmlzdGlhbml0eXRvZGF5LmNvbS9jdC8yMDI0L2FwcmlsLXdlYi1vbmx5L2phenptZW4tbG91aXMtYXJtc3Ryb25nLWR1a2UtZWxsaW5ndG9uLWNvdW50LWJhc2llLXR5ZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Duke Ellington Read His Bible in the Bath,"“Does Jazz Put the Sin in Syncopation?” asked a 1921 Ladies Home Journal article. Whimsical wordplay aside the question would become a serious one for mid-century America as parsons and priests blamed jazz for soaring juvenile crime rates drugs and extramarital sex. A 1960 poll found that among Black preachers just 1 in 5 wanted to let jazz or blues into their services. Decades before a religion editor at the Pittsburgh Courier had denounced Louis Armstrong’s “sacrilegious desecration of Spirituals.” Duke Ellington’s music was “considered worldly” counseled the Rev. John D. Bussey explaining why the local 1966 Baptist Ministers Conference had unanimously passed his resolution opposing a performance.

But whatever commandments they were breaking—and there were plenty from slighting the Sabbath to serial adultery—Duke Louis and king of swing Count Basie all seemed to take the Christian faith they’d been raised in seriously. And that faith found its way into their music.

For Louis Armstrong the connection was there from the very beginning when he learned to sing in his mother’s Sanctified church. “The ‘whole ‘Congregation would be “Wailing—‘Singing like ‘mad and ‘sound so ‘beautiful” he wrote with his characteristic expressive idiosyncratic punctuation. “I’d have myself a ‘Ball in ‘Church especially when those ‘Sisters ‘would get ‘So ‘Carried away while ‘Rev’ would be ‘right in the ‘Middle of his ‘Sermon. ‘Man those ‘Church ‘Sisters would ‘begin ‘Shouting ‘So—until their ‘petticoats would ‘fall off. … My heart went into every hymn I sang” he added. “I am still a great believer and I go to church whenever I get the chance.”

With Saturday night performances that stretched into Sundays that wasn’t often. But nearly half a century later Armstrong released an album the church sisters would have loved Louis and the Good Book with gassed-up versions of spirituals including “Go Down Moses” and “Nobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen.” He recorded “When the Saints” the anthem of the Big Easy more than 100 times.

Count Basie was raised in the Black church too. Two of his uncles were ministers; his father was a founder and pillar of Pilgrim Baptist Church in Red Bank New Jersey. In oral histories and writings fellow musicians and friends use the word spiritual to describe what Basie brought to the band. Sideman Harry “Sweets” Edison compared their group to church organists and singers who inspire congregants to “get up to shout.” Basie was a spiritual presence offstage too. “Prior to eating he would do this elaborate silent prayer” recalls tenor saxophonist Eric Schneider. If the food came before he was finished “it was understood that we should go ahead and eat.”

Duke Ellington was perhaps the most pious of the three maestros. Growing up he attended two services each Sunday: African Methodist Episcopal Zion with his father Baptist with his mother. As a young man he consulted the Bible twice a day sometimes taking the book into the bathtub and reading until the water got cold. Though he shunned most jewelry he wore a gold crucifix around his neck and carried a St. Christopher medal in his hip pocket. His Christmas card bore a simple message in gold lettering: LOVE GOD.

In the last ten years of his life Ellington devoted himself to a series of sacred concerts performances that brought together jazz and classical music spirituals gospel and the blues. Suddenly he was getting more invitations to play in churches than in dance halls. Synagogues too. “These are things people don’t know about him” said singer-songwriter Herb Jeffries. “He had a great ministry. It was hidden in his music. … He was practicing his ministry moving about here and there making people happy!” When a reporter asked how he “as a religious man” could “play in dark dingy places where depravity and drunkenness reign” Ellington whispered “Isn’t that exactly what Christ did—went into the places where people were bringing light into darkness?”

He also pushed back against preachers who accused him of defiling their churches with his concerts. “Some people ask me what prompted me to write the music for the sacred concerts. I have done so not as a matter of career but in response to a growing understanding of my own vocation” Ellington wrote in his memoir. “I think of myself as a messenger boy one who tries to bring messages to people not people who have never heard of God but those who were more or less raised with the guidance of the church.” The sacred concerts this most accomplished of composers and bandleaders added were “the most important thing I have ever done.” They were important to audiences too. Take the girl who approached Ellington after one performance telling him “You know Duke you made me put my cross back on!”

Sacrilegious then isn’t the word to describe these jazzmen. Yes their faith was unorthodox and imperfect. But it also was warmly ecumenical and personally sustaining. You can hear it not just in their Christmas tunes but in all of their jazz music rooted in the gospels and Negro spirituals they grew up with. Their abiding belief in God all three maestros made clear is what emboldened and empowered them to write the soundtrack to the Civil Rights revolution to shape the soul of America.

According to his son Mercer Duke Ellington “was quite taken with the story of the ‘Juggler of Notre Dame.’” It’s a parable that applies to Armstrong and Basie too. “The man was a great juggler who would sneak into the church and juggle before the altar. As the story goes the priests found out about it and kicked him out. God intervened and told the priests to leave him alone. The man was celebrating His presence by using the gifts that He gave him.”

Crusaders boss Stephen Baxter says a fire still burns brightly inside him to continue delivering major success at Seaview.

Baxter who was appointed in 2005 initially in a caretaker capacity recently marked his 850th game in charge of the North Belfast club.

Saturday’s Samuel Gelston’s Whiskey Irish Cup final with David Jeffrey’s Ballymena United at Windsor Park will be his 854th game at the helm.

“Someone told me recently that it was my 850th game and I was shocked” said Baxter a dramatic look of disbelief rolling across his face.

A lot of memories and achievements - three league titles two Irish Cups and a Setanta Cup included - have been pocketed over the course of the past 17 years.

But at 56 Baxter insists he’s still “fired up” to continue skippering the Shore Road ship as he targets his eleventh senior trophy as Crues boss in South Belfast.

“I had never really thought about the milestones and I never sit back and think ‘oh I’ve done all this’ or ‘I’ve done all that’” he said.

“It’s all about the here and now. On a Friday night my wife would say to me ‘you’ve 20 teams written down on that bit of paper’. That focus and preparation never leaves you.

“Maybe when I’m bored and wrap it all up I’ll sit back and reflect but every part of me is fired up to continue and drive on to do exceptionally well for Crusaders.

“And why not? We’re still riding the crest of a wave. Milestones are lovely but what worries me more is making sure we remain competitive. That keeps me awake at night.”

Baxter’s place in Seaview folklore was secure a long time ago and lifting the Irish Cup as Crusaders manager in 2009 and 2019 holds a special place in his heart.

The trophy eluded revered former managers Roy Walker who won two league titles with the Crues and Billy Johnston who delivered the club’s first Gibson Cup in 1973.

“When you look at the history of our football club you’ll hopefully look back on it in years to come and say you played your part” said Baxter.

“The Irish Cup eluded me as a player. I reached one final with Linfield and we lost it to Glenavon. I also lost what felt like a dozen semi-finals.

“Those experiences allow me to say that some players don’t ever get to a final or get the chance to lift the Irish Cup. To do that is a huge thing.”

While the winners of today’s final will qualify for Europe and pocket the associated riches Baxter insists his only focus is on silverware.

He also expects a “50-50” game with Ballymena United who are bidding to lift the blue riband trophy for the first time in 33 years.

“Let European qualification and the money side of it look after itself” said Baxter.

“The two teams are evenly matched. Ballymena are well organised and on their day they were ultra competitive. Whoever produces on the day will win the cup.”

Saturday's showpiece has a 2.30pm kick-off.

The past few years have seen companies like Tesla and General Motors looking to enter the automobile insurance market. These manufacturers see an opportunity to offer insurance to customers because of the amount of data collected from their vehicles.

However Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Warren Buffett said he has no worries about auto manufacturers entering the insurance market. Instead Warren Buffett is more concerned about Progressive's (PGR -0.02%) edge regarding insurance. Here's why.

A two-horse race for the leading auto insurer

GEICO has been around since 1936 but was purchased by Berkshire Hathaway in 1996. According to Forbes GEICO is the fourth-largest auto insurance company with a 9.5% market share. Only State Farm Allstate and Progressive have higher market shares.

However when it comes to future leaders Warren Buffett sees two companies that could become the top auto insurer -- GEICO or Progressive.

Buffett went on to say that ""I have always thought for a very long time [that] Progressive has been very well run. They have an appetite for growth. Sometimes they copy us. Sometimes we copy them. And I think that will be true five years from now ten years from now.""

Risk management is key to running a successful insurance business

Ajit Jain is Berkshire Hathaway's vice chair of Insurance Operations and is on Berkshire Hathaway's board of directors. Jain has a deep knowledge of the insurance business and ran Berkshire's reinsurance business before stepping up to his current position. Jain noted that Progressive had a significant advantage over GEICO with regard to the loss ratio.

The loss ratio is a crucial metric insurance companies use; it's the ratio of losses to premiums earned. This ratio can give you an idea of how much of your earned premiums are used to resolve claims made by clients. Good companies can control losses and keep loss ratios in check. This is something that Progressive has done exceptionally well.

According to Jain Progressive has a 12-point advantage over GEICO when it comes to the loss ratio -- a significant margin in the industry when competition is so high. According to Jain ""There are a number of causes for that but I think the biggest culprit is as far as Geico is concerned...is telematics.""

Progressive has a nearly 10-year head start on this technology

Progressive's telematics or pricing insurance policies based on driving habits is a huge advantage. Progressive was the first in the industry to use telematics when it rolled out the technology in 2010 -- giving it a considerable advantage.

Telematics works like this: Driving data is collected from devices installed on cars or through a cellphone app. This app enables Progressive to collect mileage speed braking time and when you drive during the day.

Progressive can develop personalized rates from this data and give drivers discounts for safe driving. When it comes to pricing models the more data the better. And since Progressive has over 10 years of driver data it has better models to manage risks and keep loss ratios low.

Investor takeaway

GEICO is working to catch up to Progressive. In 2019 the insurer joined other auto insurers that began to use telematics. Jain noted ""My hope is that in the next year or two Geico will be positioned to catch up with Progressive.""

Progressive has an incredible advantage over other insurers because of its built-up knowledge of telematics. As an investor in Progressive it gives me added confidence that this is a stellar stock to hold for the long haul.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway counts Brooks Running among its best-known businesses. Jim Weber the running-shoe-and-apparel brand's CEO spoke to Insider about navigating the pandemic inflation and his personal battle with cancer during Berkshire's annual-meeting weekend.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Inside the machine

Buffett famously trusts the bosses of Berkshire's dozens of subsidiaries to operate them as they see fit and doesn't push his lieutenants to collaborate with one another.

""There is nothing like Berkshire Hathaway in the business world"" Weber said. ""They invest in businesses for what they are and then truly want them to continue running as they were.""

Weber — who recently published ""Running with Purpose: How Brooks Outpaced Goliath Competitors to Lead the Pack"" — recalled how Buffett reacted when the investor spotted the heads of Berkshire's furniture businesses chatting at an event.

""Warren saw all three CEOs talking and connecting and he came over and said 'You guys better not be working on synergies; I bought three good companies I don't want one'"" Weber said.

Weathering the pandemic

Brooks was selling about 90% of its units through physical stores when the COVID-19 pandemic struck in early 2020 forcing retail outlets to shutter around the world.

Demand plummeted overnight but Weber refrained from cutting costs as he suspected people might embrace running as a safe way to exercise. Indeed by May 2020 Brooks was selling more shoes than it had been a year earlier when stores were open.

""We backed up the truck"" Weber said. He didn't lay off a single person and boosted digital-marketing spend driving sales up 27% in 2020.

Brooks suffered a fresh headache in 2021 when sweeping lockdowns in Vietnam stopped 45% of the company's production facilities from making a single shoe for three months. ""It was like a crop failure"" Weber said.

Regardless Brooks' revenue surged 31% last year to north of $1 billion and Weber expects to hit $1.3 billion this year. That figure would be $1.5 billion if his company could only catch up with demand he added.

Navigating inflation

Brooks has partly offset cost inflation in recent months by raising the prices of some products but key price points in the running category will limit further hikes Weber said.

However the executive argued that bottlenecks in ports and other parts of the global supply chain have led to artificially high prices. He expects those to fall as demand recedes to normal levels and supply disruptions and blockages dissipate.

On the other hand Weber expects more upward pressure on wages and energy prices — which feed into the costs of the synthetic materials used in Brooks' clothing and shoes.

Weber called on the Federal Reserve to cool inflation by reducing the money supply in the US economy arguing a surfeit of capital is driving up prices.

Surviving cancer

Weber was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in 2017 and had only a 20% chance of living another five years he said.

The executive called Buffett three days after receiving the devastating news. The Berkshire chief — who had survived prostate cancer a few years earlier — urged Weber to put everything he had into getting healthy again and advised him to be open about his condition with his employees and other stakeholders.

""Don't worry about Brooks get healthy and it'll be there when you come back"" Buffett said in Weber's recollection.

Weber is now cancer-free but surgical complications have left him essentially reliant on one lung preventing him from going on the long runs he previously enjoyed. Still the Brooks boss said he feels very fortunate to be alive and he's doing much better now than he was a few years ago.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL3RoZS1hc2NlbnQvcGVyc29uYWwtZmluYW5jZS9hcnRpY2xlcy93YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dC1zYXlzLXRoaXMtaXMtdGhlLWJlc3QtaW52ZXN0bWVudC15b3UtY2FuLW1ha2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett Says This Is the Best Investment You Can Make,"Making sound investments is always important but that's the case now more than ever as inflation surges and Americans cope with rising prices.

Unfortunately it can be difficult to know where to put your money and effort during times of economic uncertainty -- but listening to experts can provide helpful insight. And there's perhaps no greater expert than Warren Buffett. Often called the Oracle of Omaha Buffett is considered one of the best investors of all time as he's made billions through his strategic and successful asset purchases.

Buffett recently provided some helpful tips on what to invest in right now at the annual shareholder meeting of Berkshire Hathaway his holding company. Here's what he suggests.

Buffett's investing tip may surprise you

At the 2022 Berkshire Hathaway shareholder's meeting Buffett urged listeners to invest in themselves arguing this is the best course of action when inflation is surging. “The best investment by far is anything that develops yourself and it’s not taxed at all” Buffett said.

Buffett suggests developing your skills for a simple reason. ""Whatever abilities you have can’t be taken away from you. They can’t actually be inflated away from you."" He provided the example of a doctor or lawyer who will almost always be able to find someone willing to offer some of what they've produced in exchange for the professional services these experts provide.

This advice may be surprising from someone who has spent decades investing in companies as you might expect he'd suggest putting as much cash into your brokerage account as you can and buying up stocks. But it's a suggestion Buffett has made repeatedly over the years.

Buffett has followed his own advice

In a 2017 interview Buffett made a similar suggestion stating ""Ultimately there’s one investment that supersedes all others: Invest in yourself. Nobody can take away what you’ve got in yourself and everybody has potential they haven’t used yet.""

Buffett has also given examples of how he put this advice into practice spending $100 early in his life for a public speaking course to overcome his fear of talking in front of others. The investment he made in himself enabled him to both propose to his wife and to sell stocks thanks to his newfound skills.

How can you follow Buffett's advice?

Investing in yourself may seem like a daunting prospect but Buffett has also provided tips on how to put his advice into practice. ""Address whatever you feel your weaknesses are and do it now. Whatever you want to learn more start doing it today. Don’t put it off to your old age” Buffett suggested.

The good news is it's easier than ever to find online courses certificate programs or professional development groups that can help you develop your skills and turn weaknesses into talents. If you want to follow the advice of one of the greatest investors of all time you may want to consider looking into some of these options ASAP."

Welcome to Thrifty. A weekly column where nutrition editor and registered dietitian Jessica Ball keeps it real on how to grocery shop on a budget make healthy meals for one or two and make earth-friendly choices without overhauling your entire life.

Grocery shopping can be challenging for many especially these days with inflation increasing food prices across the U.S. For me this means I need to be more mindful of the foods I buy so that I can stay within my budget. However this doesn't mean I have to skip out on the healthy foods I love; it just takes some planning and know-how.

There are several ways to save money on your overall grocery bill like opting for frozen or canned when you can and shopping the sales. There are specific healthy ingredients that are particularly budget-friendly like bananas beans and eggs. But there is one vegetable that is always in my kitchen and part of almost everything I cook: onions. To me onions are the No. 1 vegetable to buy when you're on a budget—here's why.

Onions are overlooked when it comes to vegetables but they pack an impressive nutritional punch. One half-cup of raw onions contains 32 calories 1 gram of protein 0 grams of fat 7 grams of carbs 117 milligrams of potassium (about 4% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance) 6 milligrams of vitamin C (about 8% of the RDA) and 15 micrograms of folate (4% of the RDA). While these nutrient amounts aren't as high as some other vegetables eating onions regularly can have a significant positive impact on your overall nutrition.

Onions boast some health benefits as well. They contain the antioxidant quercetin that has been associated with decreasing risk of heart disease and helping regulate blood sugar levels. Other research suggests that pairing onions with garlic may help lower risk of certain cancers including breast cancer. Onions also have antibacterial properties that can help fight off bacteria that can cause foodborne illness. And the best part is that you can get all of this benefit for $0.97 per pound. Be sure to keep them in a cool dark and dry place like your pantry and they should last for several weeks.

My favorite thing about onions is how versatile they are. They are the base for almost every dish I cook and I notice if they're not there. Their rich earthy allium flavor lends itself to everything from pastas to stir-fries soups tacos and curries. And if you cook them low and slow long enough to caramelize them it's like they become a whole new ingredient. You can even enjoy onions on their own with our braised Melting Onions and Grilled Blooming Onion recipes.

There are so many reasons to love onions and if you're on a budget they are definitely a vegetable to add to your list. They're nutritious versatile and last a long time in your pantry so it's easy to always have some on hand. If you enjoy them regularly they can help you up your vegetable intake in a way that fits your budget.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbWVzYW5kZ2FyZGVucy5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9icmF1bi1tdWx0aW1peC01LWhhbmQtbWl4ZXItcmV2aWV30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Braun MultiMix 5 Hand Mixer HM5100 review,"The Braun MultiMix 5 Hand Mixer has an extensive range of power levels to use when baking or mixing at home but do you need them and do they deliver the power they promise?

In a market packed full of aesthetically pleasing hand mixers the Braun MultiMix 5 does almost everything a little differently. It has two whisks and two dough hook attachments an ergonomic lightweight design and an emphasis on ease of use whilst other competitors focus on style.

It has a markedly different approach to corded convenience too. Whilst a flurry of hand mixers are opting to go completely cord free this Braun mixer has an extra-long cord instead to promote 'freedom of movement'. We put this mixer to the test in various conditions to see just how it performed so that you have the most informed view of this product before you buy it.

If you want to use one of the best hand mixers for a wide variety of baking tasks including whipping and dough-making a suitable amount of power is likely to be high on your agenda. Here we take the Braun MultiMix 5 Hand Mixer through its paces to see how it performs.

First impressions of Braun MultiMix 5

In a market packed full of sleek pretty hand mixers the Braun MultiMix 5 is attempting to do something else entirely. The first marker of its difference is that whilst competitors are pushing cordless models the Braun MultiMix 5 is in fact a model with an extra-long cord instead which is said to be for maximum convenience.

The design of this mixer is also visually standout with a more practical ergonomic design to promote ease of holding alongside controls that I hadn't personally seen before which operate on a dial system. We tested this mixer in the white colorway which has green accents. Compared to the pastels of KitchenAid mixers this certainly makes this mixer a recognizable choice and focusing a little more on pragmatism over prettiness.

There's no complication with charging this mixer which was a welcome surprise after needing to power up other models. It also came with two interesting-looking whisks which are more angular than regular beaters and two dough hooks. To start up the mixer you push the button up to the 'on' position and then you use the dial to amp up to whatever level you want. The choice of nine speeds is one of the most far-ranging we've seen and the design is incredibly easy to use. You can then slip your hand into the grooves of the mixer and have a tighter grip than you might get with other models which would be great for anyone with dexterity issues. You can also place the mixer on the table solidly without the risk of it toppling over which is always reassuring.

Making whipped cream with the Braun MultiMix 5 hand mixer

First on the agenda with putting the Braun MultiMix 5 through its paces was a test to see how it contended with making whipped cream. Due to the rather interesting (read weird) shape of the beaters I was intrigued to see how the Braun performed especially since it also doesn't have a dedicated whisk attachment. As I got to work with the mixer I found that you could feel the power running through the mixer and that it felt extremely easy to hold. It doesn't have the dedicated 'soft start' programming like the Oster HeatSoft model but you can begin it at the lowest speed of one and still feel in control.

(Image credit: Future/Molly Cleary)

There was no doubt that the Braun MultiMix 5 performed the best out of any of the mixers we tested when it came to the whipped cream test producing the best consistency of cream in the fastest time. The mixer also just felt effortless to use. It's fair to say that we might have judged this mixer as a little clunky straight out of the box but in the first test it really impressed.

Making cake batter with the Braun MultiMix 5 hand mixer

Next it was time to see how those uniquely shaped beaters contended with whipping up a cake batter. We used a simple recipe to not get caught in any complications and found that once again it put on a stellar performance. It was very quick to combine the components of the batter and yielded a fluffy desirable cake batter at the end.

(Image credit: Future/Molly Cleary)

Though the batter came out excellently it has to be said that the Braun mixer was also the loudest model we had used. It was not too extreme but it was more noticeable at around 80 decibels. If you're in a sound-sensitive environment that might be something to bear in mind.

Making cookie dough with the Braun MultiMix 5 hand mixer

The Braun MultiMix 5 was the only mixer we tested that came with two dough hooks which we put to the test in creating a cookie dough mix at our testing facility. For the first step we stuck with the beaters to cream the butter and sugar and found that the process was effortless as the other tests had been.

(Image credit: Future/Molly Cleary)

Then we moved over to test the dough hooks which was a smooth transition thanks to the large ejector button within the middle of the mixer. This might look to some like a supercharge speed button but instead will allow your mixers to pop out with ease.

(Image credit: Future/Molly Cleary)

We put the dough hooks to the test to see how it helped the mix come into a more solid shape which then made it easier to get the dough onto our baking trays. Another important test was how it combined chocolate chips as it's essential with cookies like this that there is a good even distribution. The cookie dough mix as with the other tests came out excellently with this mixer surprising with its power and prowess when it comes to power and efficiency.

Cleaning

Another standout feature of the Braun MultiMix 5 is that an effort has been made to keep clean-up to an absolute minimum. The mixer has a completely sealed body making it so that none of your mixture can seep inside the housing and effectively wreak havoc inside. Instead you'll have no trouble with wiping down the exterior of your mixer and popping the attachments into your dishwasher (or washing them in soapy water if you prefer).

How it compares

When it comes to performance as evidenced in our tests the Braun MultiMix 5 is really up there with the finest hand mixers you can buy. To directly compare it to what is arguably the market leader the KitchenAid Cordless Hand Mixer the results of our tests were hugely similar with the Braun also having the advantage of the extra dough hooks if you love making bread or cookies.

The KitchenAid Cordless Mixer and the Braun MultiMix 5 also have the same number of speeds with both having a great range. The Braun certainly feels more powerful but the results are mostly the same. In terms of ease of use the Braun was slightly easier to hold onto thanks to the ergonomic grip.

There's room for debate when it comes to the aesthetics of these mixers if you put them head to head. In my opinion the KitchenAid Cordless mixer absolutely cleans up when it comes to matters of style and would be a mixer I would absolutely love to have on my countertop. With the Braun mixer this feeling is a lot less so though this will all depend on personal tastes. The Braun MultiMix 5 is also more affordable with an RRP of $84.95 so if you're stuck between the two make your decision based on which one you like the look of more and where your price point is as on matters on performance they are very much the same.

Should you buy the Braun MultiMix 5 hand mixer?

I was extremely pleasantly surprised by the Braun MultiMix 5 Hand Mixer and found that it could perform alongside the most prestigious models out there. It has plenty of worthwhile features to keep your attention from the easy-clean design to the extra bonus of those dough hook attachments.

The controls of the MultiMix5 are very intuitive and the design that includes an ergonomic groove for your hand means you can put everything into action with one touch. It's a great show of how hand mixers can provide power without needing to rely on a stand mixer. On all grounds of performance I would recommend this mixer for your home. If you want a mixer to adorn your countertop then things might be different and the allure of the KitchenAid styling might just win out. The decision will depend totally on your preferences with this mixer coming through as a real contender.

However budgets are tighter than usual this year. So Verizon is making it somewhat more affordable to treat mom with a Mother's Day gift she's bound to love.

Currently at Verizon you can get an iPhone 13 for free when you trade-in your old device and open a new line with unlimited data. That's one of the best iPhone 13 deals we've seen. If you don't have an old phone to trade in Verizon is also offering a free iPhone SE 2022 when you open a new line with select unlimited data plan. Remember you can opt to buy these online and pickup in-store.

iPhone 13: free w/ trade-in + unlimited @ Verizon

Get mom one of the best phones on the market. For a limited time at Verizon you can get a free iPhone 13 when you trade-in your old device and open a new unlimited line. Plus you'll get an additional $200 if you switch from a competing carrier. Make sure you check our Verizon promo codes for the latest discounts.

iPhone SE 2022: free w/ unlimited + new line @ Verizon

Don't have an old or damaged phone to trade in? New and existing members can get a new iPhone SE 2022 for free when you open a new unlimited line. That's $429 off and one of the best deals we've seen from Verizon. No trade-in is required for this deal.

The iPhone 13 is one of the best phones you can buy. Naturally it comes with a high price tag. The base iPhone 13 costs $799 whereas the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max cost $999 and $1099 respectively. Meanwhile the iPhone 13 mini is the smallest and least-expensive model in the lineup coming in at $699.

In our iPhone 13 review we called the Editor's Choice phone the best iPhone for most people. We like that Apple has finally bumped the base model's storage to 128GB so you don't have to jump to the next storage tier just to fit everything on your phone. The A15 processor — the same one found in the iPhone 13 Pro models — continues to set the pace for mobile processors allowing the iPhone 13 to outperform any Android device.

However the real story is the cameras. The iPhone 13 still features two rear lenses but they have bigger sensors which translates to improved low-light photography. What’s more Apple includes a number of computational-powered features like Cinematic mode to automatically shift focus when you’re shooting video.

Alternatively the iPhone SE 2022 is the perfect phone for any mom. In our iPhone SE 2022 review we called the new phone the fastest phone you can buy for under $500. It's very similar to its predecessor. The main difference is the addition of a new A15 Bionic CPU which is the same chip found in the iPhone 13 lineup. The new CPU brings better battery life (up to 15 hours vs. up to 13 hours) and advanced camera features like Photographic Styles and Deep Fusion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRwb2xpY2UuY29tL2hwLWNocm9tZWJvb2steDItZGVhbC1iZXN0LWJ1eS0yOTkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Grab this 2-in-1 HP Chromebook with keyboard pen and LTE capability for $299 right now,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRwb2xpY2UuY29tL2hwLWNocm9tZWJvb2steDItZGVhbC1iZXN0LWJ1eS0yOTkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

The antigen-binding properties determine both the sensitivity and selectivity of the immunoassay. The high specificity of antibody is fundamental to their natural function51. The generated earlier anti-MAGE antibody specifically binds MAGE antigen synthesized on various carrier proteins (Supplementary Fig. S1). We have previously reported no cross-reactivity of the anti-MAGE antibody with other known AGEs4. The specificity was also confirmed in competitive ELISA with model MAGE generated on MB and protein-fee lysine (Supplementary Fig. S2). Using the anti-MAGE monoclonal antibody we have identified some proteins (~ 25 and 75 kDa) in human blood from the healthy donor that were clearly separated on a 2D electrophoresis and contained MAGE antigen (Fig. 1). This encouraged us to attempt extraction of the in vivo MAGE antigen from human blood. MAGE was isolated from the diabetic serum (pooled from several patients) and from the donors’ plasma (healthy individuals). The extracted proteins were analyzed by WB (Fig. 2B) and mass spectrometry showing the presence of 59.4 kDa (1S) and 50.0 kDa (2S) proteins in the blood of diabetic patients in contrast to 61.7 kDa (1P) and 49.3 kDa (2P) proteins in the blood of healthy donors. In both samples the proteins with mass over 25 kDa were identified. We suspect these are the light chains of the secreted immunoglobulins52 however it needs further confirmation.

In the next step several types of antibodies specific for different proteins and mass spectrometry analysis were employed for identity verification of the proteins (extracted from human blood) modified with MAGE antigen. In sample 1S (59.4 kDa) the human serum albumin (HSA) showed the best score and 38.8% sequence coverage. This protein was confirmed by WB with the specific anti-HSA antibody (Fig. 3A). Albumin is the most abundant plasma protein and accounts for over 50% of serum proteins in healthy subjects. It plays a key role in maintaining oncotic pressure and is known to be a versatile protein carrier for the transport of various endogenous and exogenous ligands53. HSA has a half-life of approximate 3 weeks sufficient for significant glycation progressing to AGE formation54. The structure of HSA consists of a single polypeptide chain of 585 amino acids with a theoretical molecular mass of 66.438 kDa55. The molecular mass calculated from spectrometric analysis shows 71.317 kDa (Table 1) and the difference might result from the protein in vivo modifications56. It has been proven that this protein is subject to several chemical modifications including acetylation oxidation glycosylation glycation carbonylation and phosphorylation affecting its binding and antigenic properties57. After sample separation by SDS-PAGE the protein molecular mass was calculated to be 59.4 kDa (Fig. 3). Migration of proteins in a polyacrylamide gel in the presence of SDS which does not correlate with the molecular mass formula is called “gel shift” and appears to be fairly common but has not yet been fully clarified58. This effect is explained by differences in the secondary and tertiary structure of the protein the intrinsic net charge of the protein and the amount of bound SDS58596061. The literature shows that post-translational modifications of albumin cause changes in the secondary and tertiary structure of HSA causing e.g. reduced content of α-helices in the structure of polypeptide62. It may affect the degree of detergent loading and result in a difference between the actual mass of the protein and the mass calculated from the electrophoretic migration in a gel. The difference in theoretical and observed molecular mass however does not challenge the identity of HSA as the in vivo MAGE-carrier since it has been confirmed by mass spectrometry (Table 2).

In the sample 1S (Fig. 2B; Table 1) apart from albumin the α-1-antitrypsin and heavy chains of IgA and IgG were also identified with high scores. Water-soluble and tissue-diffusing α-1-antitrypsin is a circulating glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 52 kDa63. Its primary function is to protect tissues from enzymes such as neutrophil elastase and proteinase 3 released during inflammation64. The half-life in the blood of α-1-antitrypsin is 4–5 days thus is not sufficient for generation of AGEs and only allows the formation of Amadori products5463. However the presence of other MAGE-analogous structures on this protein that result from other modifications cannot be ruled out especially that the origin of the in vivo MAGE has not been elucidated so far. The presence of immunoglobulins G and A in the 1S sample was also excluded by the WB analysis (Fig. 3; Table 2) based on the reaction with specific antibodies showing bands of different molecular mass in comparison to the result of WB with the anti-MAGE antibodies (Fig. 2B).

The sample 1P corresponding to the proteins with a mass of about 61.7 kDa (Fig. 3B) showed presence of fibrinogen α (highest score) and IgA heavy chain (highest sequence coverage) (Table 2). Fibrinogen is a multifunctional acute-phase plasma protein playing a key role in hemostasis and the coagulation cascade. It occurs in the blood plasma of healthy people at concentrations of 1.5–4 mg/ml. This protein consists of two identical subunits containing three polypeptide chains referred to as Aα Bβ and γ chains with a total mass of approximately 340 kDa65. According to the literature the molecular mass of the fibrinogen α chain is ~ 95 kDa66 which significantly exceeds the value of the mass determined by SDS-PAGE and WB (Fig. 3). Moreover fibrinogen has a short blood half-life of 3–5 days67 and its glycation seems unlikely. Thus it was not considered in our further studies but other MAGE analogous structures (different in vivo origin) might mediate binding to the anti-MAGE antibody. The mass spectrometry (Table 2) and immunoblotting analysis provided evidence that sample 1P consists of immunoglobulins (Fig. 3D). The protein band with a mass of 61.5 kDa evidenced with the anti-IgA antibody correlated with the mass of the band evidenced with the anti-MAGE antibody (Fig. 3B band 1P). Theoretical mass of the IgA heavy chain constant region (38.49 kDa) reflects the specific peptide identified by mass spectrometry without considering the variable domain of the whole heavy chain molecule. In electrophoresis we observed the entire heavy chain of IgA migrating around 60 kDa as it is found in literature6869. Immunoglobulin A is the second most abundant antibody in human blood. It neutralizes toxins and prevents from microbial invasion through the mucosa epithelial barrier. Although this protein has a fairly short half-life of 5–7 days 70 there are disease states in which the elimination of IgA is impaired and the protein is deposited in the tissues71 allowing for its glycation.

In the sample 2S (serum of diabetic patients) and in the sample 2P (plasma of healthy donors) heavy chain IgG1 (sequence coverage 30 and 28.7% respectively) was identified by mass spectrometry as the protein with the highest identification score (Table 2). The theoretical molecular mass of this protein is 49.93 kDa and it is consistent with the protein band observed in WB with anti-MAGE antibody (50.0 and 49.3 kDa for 2S and 2P bands respectively) (Fig. 3 Table 2). In addition the same size proteins were revealed upon membrane staining with anti-IgG antibody (50.0 kDa for band 7 and 49.2 kDa for band 8 (Fig. 3C Table 2). Literature describes the human IgG heavy chain as a protein of about 50 kDa72 which is in agreement with our observation in WB for both the positive control and test samples (Fig. 3). Slightly lower mass of IgG in the sample 2P (healthy donor) may indicate a lower degree of modification of this protein compared to the IgG in diabetic patient sera. Constant regions of IgG3 and IgG2 heavy chains were also identified in sample 2S and constant regions of IgG2 and IgG4 heavy chains in sample 2P. The antibodies used in immunoblotting to verify the presence of IgG in the sample are directed to the Fc region of human IgG which did not allow for the precise determination of the subclass of the identified protein. IgG accounts for about 75% of human serum immunoglobulins and is the primary antibody of the secondary immune response. It has a half-life of 23 days which is sufficient to generate AGEs through the glycation process73.

In the same sample 2P the other proteins i.e. β and γ chains of fibrinogen have been identified (Table 2) that theoretical mass was calculated as 56.58 kDa and 52.11 kDa. In the studies by Repetto et al. fibrinogen β chain migrated at about 50 40 and 37 kDa74 while in the studies of Luo et al. the mass of the β chain was determined at 52 kDa and the γ chain at 46 kDa75. The observed masses only slightly differ from the mass of the band determined by us (49.3 kDa Fig. 3B) on a membrane probed with the anti-MAGE antibody. The short half-life of this protein makes it less attractive target for glycation therefore we focused on IgG identified with a higher score.

Our data suggest that MAGE antigen is present in vivo on several proteins mainly albumin IgG and IgA—the main components of blood plasma accounting for over 70% of all plasma proteins (mainly HSA and IgG)54. This is the first report showing specific proteins modified with MAGE found in serum of the diabetic patients (albumin and IgG) and in plasma of the healthy people (IgG and IgA). Results suggest that the MAGE antigen is physiologically present on immunoglobulins for which glycation is a common post-translational modification76 but in pathology and oxidative stress formation of MAGE antigen can also occur on other proteins like albumin. These observations require further confirmation in a larger sample cohort. We assume that IgA modified with MAGE identified in the plasma sample from the healthy donor and not isolated from the serum sample of the diabetic patients may be explained by abundance of MAGE-modified albumin and IgG under hyperglycemic conditions that saturated the Sepharose-anti-MAGE resin preventing from binding the proteins of a lower abundance. Further studies to identify additional MAGE-modified proteins in human blood should consider the changes in the immunoprecipitation protocol i.e. higher concentration of the anti-MAGE antibody and sample re-precipitation.

Significance of our study refers to the glycation-induced change in function of the circulating natural antibodies and potentially some therapeutic antibodies used recently more often in clinics. AGEs increase immunogenicity of immunoglobulins and cause production of antibodies against this modified protein77 as reported in type 2 diabetes78 atherosclerosis79 and rheumatoid arthritis (RA)808182. Glycation is also a suspected cause of decreased elimination of IgA by the liver and the protein accumulation in blood83. Serum IgA levels are significantly higher in diabetic patients than in healthy subjects848586. High levels of IgA is a sign of diabetic nephropathy86 the most commonly recognized type of glomerular disease in the world and manifested by the formation of mesangial IgA deposits87. Glycation of HSA have also serious impact on its function in defense against oxidative stress88 transport of various ligands and regulating of an oncotic pressure due to changes in the secondary and tertiary structure89. HSA glycation status is associated with development of autoantibodies in diabetic patients9091 and progression of cardiovascular disease92. In this paper we present for the first time that several MAGE-modified proteins are present not only in blood but also in a peritoneal fluid collected from the GC patients (Fig. 4). Similarly Deng et al. reported an accumulation of the glucose-derived AGEs in tumor and blood of the GC patients49 suggesting a potential role of MAGE in cancer. Therefore some proteins with molecular mass about 25 kDa and 60 kDa modified by MAGE found in our study in peritoneal fluid (suggesting immunoglobulin protein and HSA) will be further investigated to determine the protein identity and relevance to disease pathology and progression. The interesting direction will be also further studies on plasma from diabetic patients to verify the presence of MAGE on fibrinogen in this pathological state.

In summary the presented data add to the knowledge on protein modifications in vivo and their potential role in diabetes cancer and adaptive immune response associated with modification of the circulating antibodies.",,,,,,,,,,,,

With an elevation well above 3000ft this park is home to fantastic mountain vistas beautiful flowers and even a small fishing lake. It’s cool summer days make it a hot destination for many making it one of Georgia’s most popular and highly visited state parks. This hardly qualifies it as a “road less traveled” but it is nevertheless a wonderful destination for the entire family.

The highlights of the park are the numerous overlooks from which between them all you can see for a hundred miles in any direction. When you first arrive at the park visitor center you are immediately greeted by a parking area and arguably the park’s best view: the Black Rock Overlook. It’s elevation is at 3446 feet and looks to the south/southeast. A large picturesque wooden fence lines the edge of the large rock face keeping it safe for children.

(click photos to enlarge)

The Blue Ridge overlook sits at 3388 feet and looks east off a “boardwalk” jetting out off the mountainside.

The Cowee Overlook sits a bit lower at 3195 feet and looks to the northeast towards Mountain City though the city is not visible from the overlook.

The Tennessee Overlook is located on the Tennessee Rock trail which is a 2.2 mile long loop trail that runs along the side of Black Rock Mountain then climbs to the summit and eventually to the Tennessee Rock Overlook. Since this is a loop trail you can access the rock from one of two directions. You park in a well-marked lot and follow the signs to a point where the trail forks. The left fork takes you directly to Tennessee Rock but the right fork takes you on the loop through the forest. If you start on the right you initially go through the numerous hollows that run down the side of the mountain where many wildflowers can be seen blooming.

Once the trail makes a hard left you will head into a pine and mountain laurel/rhododendron thicket.

The trail eventually turns significantly steeper and heads to the summit of Black Rock Mountain.

After you reach the summit the trail parallels the road and runs right into Tennessee Rock just a few hundred yards down the trail. This overlook has a terrific and hard-to-find view north.

The trail runs downhill quite steeply and back to the parking lot from this point ending the 2.2 mile loop.

Another much shorter trail runs from the campground to Ada-hi Falls which is a fairly unimpressive flow-wise but nice falls viewed from a viewing platform at the end of the trail.

Black Rock Lake is located down a dirt road and features a .85 mile loop trail that runs around the excellent fishing lake (a dock is included on one side of the lake).

Besides fishing there are picnic tables located near a feeder creek at the parking area as well.

Overall Black Rock Mountain offers something for everyone whether you want to hike fish camp or even sunbathe on a rock. It is open all spring summer and fall so go check it out and enjoy some time in the outdoors!

I’ll see you on the road (or the trail)!

(Reuters) Claims online that billionaire Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates owns the majority of U.S. farmland and that BlackRock the world’s largest asset manager owns the majority of U.S. single-family houses are factually inaccurate according to industry data and spokespeople for Gates and BlackRock.

“Bill Gates is buying up the majority of American farmland and BlackRock is buying the majority of single-family houses but I m supposed to believe the biggest threat to us is Elon Musk buying Twitter?” one Twitter user wrote. The tweet had gathered over 215000 likes at the time of writing. An archived version of the tweet can be found (archive.ph/8Tq36).

Another meme circulating online reads: “Bill Gates is buying all the farmland. Recently Bill Gates has purchased 300000 acres of farmland you would think that buying all of the farmland would be bigger news than Elon Musk buying all of Twitter (here) (here).

BILL GATES AND U.S. FARMLAND

Gates does not own the majority of U.S. farmland.

Reuters traced the figure cited by social media posts as the number of acres owned by Bill Gates to ‘The Land Report’ which reports on major land ownership in the United States. The figure cited by The Land Report was subsequently reported by major news outlets including Business Insider and Forbes.

According to a January 2021 article by ‘The Land Report’ Gates owned 242000 acres of farmland through two investment management firms - Cottonwood Ag Management and Cascade Investment.

The figure is far below the total area of U.S. farmland. A 2021 report published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said there were 895300000 acres of farmland in the United States. Using those figures Gates would own about 0.027% of U.S. farmland.

A spokesperson for Gates also told Reuters the claim that Gates owns the majority of U.S. farmland was false pointing to the USDA figures.

In a statement to Reuters editor of ‘The Land Report’ and author of the article published by the outlet on farmland owned by Gates Eric O’ Keefe called the claim “absurd.”

While Gates does not own the majority of U.S. farmland he is the largest private farmland owner according to ‘The Land Report’.

BLACKROCK AND SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES

While BlackRock does not directly own single-family houses as the world’s largest asset manager (here) it owns stock in companies that do. But these companies do not own a majority of U.S. single-family homes.

Invitation Homes for example has approximately 80000 homes for lease across the country and is the largest landlord for single-family homes in the United States. American Homes 4 Rent holds around 57024 single-family properties. BlackRock is a shareholder in both companies.

There are 94.6 million single-family houses in the United States according to the latest data available from the U.S. Census Bureau American Housing Survey (2019) (bit.ly/3seI7kV). As of the latest Rental Housing Finance Survey (2018) there were 19.955 million rental properties in the United States (bit.ly/3FdPtKZ) 17.16 million of them single unit rental properties (bit.ly/3KLCjWH). Just over 70% of these were owned by individual investors. For context Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent’s combined homes would be less than 1% of the 17.16 million homes if total housing numbers stayed the same in the last three years.

Contacted by Reuters a BlackRock spokesperson said: “BlackRock is not buying single-family homes and is not competing with individuals to purchase houses in America.”

Business entities have however been increasing their presence as owners of rental properties. According to the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies (JCHS) using data of the Rental Housing Finance Survey between 2001 and 2018 the proportion of rental properties owned by non-individual investors which include partnerships trustees for estate real estate corporations real estate investment trusts and other entities increased from 18% to 26%.

Real estate investors overall have also been increasingly targeting single-family homes. According to Redfin single-family housing represented over 70% of the properties purchased by investors in the third quarter of 2021.

VERDICT

False. Bill Gates does not own the majority of U.S. farmland. As of 2020 industry reports show he owned about 0.027% of U.S. farmland. While private companies and corporations are increasing their ownership of U.S. homes BlackRock through its investments does not own a majority of single-family homes."
BX,Blackstone,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN1cnJlbnRhZmZhaXJzLm9yZy8yMDIyLzA1L3RoZS1hdHJvY2lvdXMtcmVhc29uaW5nLW9mLXNhbXVlbC1hbGl0b9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Atrocious Reasoning of Samuel Alito Current Affairs,"According to a leaked majority opinion written by Republican justice Samuel Alito the Supreme Court “has voted to strike down” 1973’s Roe v. Wade eliminating women’s constitutional right to an abortion and permitting states to criminalize the medical procedure. The opinion is not final but it has been confirmed to be authentic meaning that Roe is almost certain to be gone and abortion will soon be illegal in many parts of the country.

Some of the coverage of the decision has focused on the leak itself. SCOTUSblog called it “the gravest most unforgivable sin.” Conservatives are up in arms. The Federalist went with the headline “The SCOTUS Abortion Decision Leak Is What Actual Treasonous Insurrection Looks Like.” Right-wing writer Matt Walsh called it “an attempt to completely upend and delegitimize the rule of law incite violence and chaos and potentially plunge the nation into civil war.” Cool kid’s philosopher Ben Shapiro called for the leaker to be “prosecut[ed] to the full extent of the law” because “there is little question that this leak is designed to create threat to the life and limb of any justice who signs onto the majority opinion.”

The outrage over the leak is a little odd; if conservatives think the decision is reasonable and good and if it or something like it will soon be the law of the land anyway they should be pleased. If the news had come out a month before Brown v. Board of Education that the Court intended to strike down segregation in public schools it’s hard to think anyone would have called the disclosure an act of “treason.” Instead we must suspect that conservatives would rather discuss the leak than a decision that will be unpopular (fewer than 1 in 3 Americans want Roe overturned) and that makes the Supreme Court look like a nakedly “political” institution imposing the Republican agenda on the country.

But we should keep our focus on what matters: the overturning of Roe is an authoritarian elimination of women’s rights. It is illegitimate and will have terrible human consequences. The Supreme Court justifies its decisions by saying that they are compelled by logic and reason and if we are to object to the Court’s decision it is worth not just showing that the right to an abortion is an important social good (something easily proven) but also demonstrating what’s wrong with the explanation Alito gives for striking this constitutional right from the books.

The PDF of the opinion is 98 pages long but Alito’s reasoning is simple and easy to grasp. Roe v. Wade he says was wrongly decided. This is because “the Constitution makes no reference to abortion and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision.” Alito admits that some rights unmentioned in the Constitution may still be protected by it but such rights must be “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition” and “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” The right to an abortion Alito says has no roots in “tradition” because “until the latter part of the 20th century such a right was entirely unknown in American law” and the procedure was criminalized in many parts of the country. In fact he says for hundreds of years “great common-law authorities like [Henry de] Bracton [Sir Edward] Coke [Sir Matthew] Hale and [Sir William] Blackstone all wrote that a post-quickening abortion was a crime—and a serious one at that.” In fact in both English and American law there was “an unbroken tradition of prohibiting abortion on pain of criminal punishment.”

Alito insists that the decision is “not based on any view about when a state should regard prenatal life as having rights or legally cognizable interests.” Instead he says that the Court in Roe “short-circuited the democratic process by closing it to the large number of Americans who dissented in any respect from Roe.” It is simply not the place of the Supreme Court he says to “decide how abortion may be regulated in the States.” Nor can the principle of “stare decisis” which countenances leaving settled decisions alone save Roe because its “reasoning was exceptionally weak” and an “abuse of judicial authority.”

In analyzing Alito’s opinion the first thing we should dwell on is his phrase “until the latter part of the 20th century.” For Alito it is very important that “traditionally” there was no fixed right to an abortion and that the right does not appear in the Constitution. It is a recent right and for Alito it is therefore suspect because as an “originalist” he believes his job as a justice is to uphold the Founding Fathers’ vision for the constitutional order.

There has already been criticism of Alito’s history here with historians and legal scholars arguing that Alito is wrong to say that there was an unbroken tradition of abortion criminalization. More importantly however none of this history should matter at all for a very simple reason: until 1920 the United States was officially a patriarchy. The Supreme Court’s decisions about rights were made entirely by men until Sandra Day O’Connor joined the Court in 1981. It’s still the case that only 27 percent of federal lawmakers are women which itself is a 50 percent increase compared to how many there were just a decade ago. Women had no input into the writing of the Constitution—John Adams literally laughed off his wife Abigail’s plea to “remember the ladies” when drafting the nation’s founding charter. (“I cannot but laugh. … We know better than to repeal our masculine systems” he wrote to her.) The great legal scholars Alito cites for their authority on natural rights are men named Henry Edward William and Matthew who likely spent their entire careers without once wondering whether women might have valuable things to say on the topic of their own rights.

The implication of this should be obvious although it entirely escapes Alito: Unless we are still to live in a patriarchy we can give absolutely no weight to conceptions of women’s rights that came before women were allowed to participate in politics and law. Let us assume that Alito is entirely correct about his history and that abortions were widely criminalized in the 19th century and that the idea of a basic right to abortion does come from the “latter part of the 20th century.” What of it? The laws were being made by men i.e. they were undemocratic and illegitimate. A court that uses the 19th century definition of women’s rights to decide which rights the Court is bound to protect today is explicitly imposing the past’s patriarchy on the present. It’s a shocking act of turning back the clock and yet Alito seems unaware that there’s even an issue with citing “traditional” (i.e. patriarchal) rights to decide which rights women have in 2022.

Alito doesn’t actually discuss why all of a sudden in the “latter part of the 20th century” the idea of a right to abortion sprang into being but a little something happened in the 1960s and 1970s called the women’s liberation movement. Abortion rights did not come from a spontaneous whim by Roe’s opinion author Justice Harry Blackmun. They were the culmination of a social movement that arose because women were horrified that laws written by men were causing women horrific suffering and death and being forced to give birth against one’s will was considered a grotesque violation of women’s rights.

The stories of pre-Roe America are easily found and very disturbing. Underground feminist groups worked to help women procure illegal abortions though they faced both the possibility of prosecution and serious medical risks. Leslie J. Reagan in When Abortion Was a Crime describes the situation:

“Public-health statistics revealed an appalling picture of death and discrimination. Health-care workers and public-health officers observed women dying and thousands more hospitalized as a result of a procedure that could be safe but was not because it was illegal. The illegality of abortion had produced a public-health disaster—especially for low-income and minority women. … The risk of dying from an abortion was closely linked to race and class. Nearly four times as many women of color as white women died as a result of an abortion. … The story of Doris B. a twenty-six-year-old black woman in Chicago underlines the inherent limitations of legalization in one faraway state and of local efforts to provide abortions for low-income women who sought them. Even though the referral service and [the Jane Collective] tried to help all Chicago women who needed abortions some low-income women never found either organization. The “tragic event” was her friend later wrote “well-etched in my memory.” Doris B. had four children and depended on welfare to care for them. “It was a constant struggle to provide for these children” her friend recalled “and she felt that another child was more than she could endure.” Doris B. considered going to New York but poverty “made that impossible. Doris chose the ‘cheaper’ illegal alternative in Chicago.” She died from septicemia following her illegal abortion in 1972 and her children became orphans.

So Roe came about in part because feminist legal scholars made the compelling argument that criminalizing abortion was an unconstitutional deprivation of a basic liberty. The state did not have the right to impose these kinds of horrors on its citizens.

The legal reasoning of Roe has been criticized since the decision was announced in 1973. Indeed the reasoning of the opinion is a mess and its critics are right that it essentially invents a right and creates arbitrary legal distinctions (the right varies by trimester of pregnancy). But it’s important to understand why the decision is a mess: Conservatives are certainly correct that the Supreme Court in Roe decided that there ought to be a constitutional right to abortion and then declared that therefore there was one even though the Constitution itself is silent on the question. But conservatives miss why this is a legitimate way for the Court to operate. Conservatives typically believe that the job of a judge in constitutional law cases is to apply the Constitution as written and so they see efforts to grant new rights as a form of “judicial activism.” They do not reckon with the fact that the Constitution has almost no democratic legitimacy because the Founding Fathers chose not to have it ratified by most of the people who would be ruled by it. This causes a very serious problem when members of the groups excluded from the document’s drafting (such as women Native Americans and Black people) seek to assert claims of having fundamental rights and to block the state from violating those rights. To apply the Founders’ Constitution is to impose the vision of a small group of 18th century property owners on people who never consented to be ruled by that group.

Roe v. Wade then was part of the attempt to save the Constitution by ensuring that judges interpret it to contain an unwritten provision that reads something like “Do not commit any especially egregious infringements on people’s liberties.” Other cases from Brown v. Board of Education (barring racial segregation in public schools) to Obergefell v. Hodges (barring the prohibition of same-sex marriages) are part of this tradition which tries to ensure that the law does not get too out of step with the basic principles of justice and the demands of previously-excluded groups to have their rights respected. For an “originalist” committed to enforcing the vision of the white men who ruled the country for centuries it would be difficult to justify striking down segregated schools. But the judges of the Warren court understood that if people are to have any respect for a legal system grounded in illegitimacy and unfairness (the Warren court was after all 9 white men until Thurgood Marshall was appointed in 1967) it is necessary for the institution to attempt to avoid the appearance of upholding a repressive social order.1

What Samuel Alito doesn’t understand then is that by making it clear that he wishes to enforce “traditional” conceptions of rights he eliminates any reason why people who hold different conceptions of rights should respect the Supreme Court. Alito’s opinion includes an outright “fuck you” to members of the public who might be outraged at having a basic constitutional right stripped away: “We cannot allow our decisions to be affected by extraneous influences such as concern about the public’s reaction to our work.” Clarence Thomas said something similar about the decision commenting that the public is “becoming addicted to wanting particular outcomes” from the Supreme Court but “we can’t be an institution that can be bullied into giving you just the outcomes you want.” Alito and Thomas are determined to enforce their understanding of the Constitutional order by overturning Roe even if less than a third of Americans are with them. But the question they don’t seem to have asked themselves is: why should the rest of us then respect their decisions? If the Supreme Court consists of a group of right-wing idealogues who pretend not to be enforcing their political preferences even though that’s exactly what they’re doing enforcing a document that was never ratified by the populace what allegiance is such an institution owed? Why should people be content to have the absolute power to determine basic rights vested in this tiny group of unelected unaccountable ignorant reactionaries? Many women will not see any reason why the scope of their own bodily autonomy should be decided by Clarence Thomas (an alleged sexual harasser) and Samuel Alito (who once joined a group devoted to keeping women and people of color out of Princeton). If Alito and Thomas take their “originalism” seriously and are determined to impose it on the rest of us there is no reason for us not to try to strip the Supreme Court of its power or pack it with those we can better trust to enforce the liberties we value.

There is something tyrannical about Alito’s imposition of The Traditional Conception of Rights which he says did not include abortion on a public that overwhelmingly did not wish to see the constitutional right to abortion taken away. Today the people of the country possess a guaranteed liberty against criminalization by the state that may be taken away from them in a matter of months by unelected jurists who do not think women’s bodily autonomy is valuable enough to protect. Alito protests that his decision does not weigh in on whether banning abortion is good or bad—it merely leaves it up to the states to decide.2 But this is dishonest: one of the reasons Alito gives for overturning Roe but not overturning same-sex marriage or the right to birth control (which are also not explicit in the Constitution and had to be made up after the fact) is that the government has a greater interest in regulating abortion because of the value of fetal life. (“What sharply distinguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on which Roe and Casey rely is something that both those decisions acknowledge: Abortion destroys what those decisions call ‘potential life’ and what the law at issue in this case regards as the life of an ‘unborn human being.’”) In other words it’s precisely by taking a position on the philosophical question of how important unborn “life” is relative to the right of bodily autonomy that Alito justifies overturning Roe. (Of course even though Alito draws this distinction his emphasis on Traditional Rights still means same-sex marriage and even the right to birth control are under threat. These rights are based on reasoning that is just as shaky from an originalist perspective.)

But even though having a small group of unelected Republicans taking away an important constitutional right in violation of the wishes of the majority of Americans would seem plainly undemocratic there are those who say that it’s actually the defenders of Roe v. Wade who are opposed to democracy. Glenn Greenwald for instance says that many defenders of Roe are confused about democracy and that while they think they oppose “unelected judges” making laws asking for courts to protect the right to abortion means asking unelected judges to overturn democratically-promulgated laws. He explains:

Like the U.S. Constitution itself the Court is designed to be an anti-majoritarian check against the excesses of majoritarian sentiment. … [T]he purpose of the Bill of Rights is fundamentally anti-democratic and anti-majoritarian. It bars majorities from enacting laws that infringe on the fundamental rights of minorities. … The mere judicial act of invalidating a law supported by a majority of citizens—though frequently condemned as “undemocratic”—is in fact a fulfillment of one of the Court’s prime functions in a republic. … Unless one believes that the will of the majority should always prevail—that laws restricting or abolishing free speech due process and the free exercise of religion should be permitted as long as enough citizens support it—then one must favor the Supreme Court’s anti-democratic and anti-majoritarian powers. … [The argument that] unelected Supreme Court Justices have no business mucking around in abortion rights—is supremely ironic given that it was unelected judges who issued Roe back in 1973 in the process striking down numerous democratically elected laws. … Roe was the classic expression of the above-described anti-majoritarian and anti-democratic values: seven unelected men (for those who believe such demographic attributes matter) struck down laws that had been supported by majorities and enacted by many states which heavily restricted or outright banned abortion procedures. The sole purpose of Roe was to deny citizens the right to enact the anti-abortion laws no matter how much popular support they commanded. … The right of the people to decide rather than judges is the primary value which Alito repeatedly invokes in defending the overruling of Roe and once again empowering citizens through their elected representatives to make these decisions. … [W]hether Roe’s anti-democratic ruling was an affirmation of fundamental rights or a form of judicial tyranny depends solely on whether one believes that the Constitution bars the enactment of laws which restrict abortion or whether it is silent on that question. … [T]he only way to defend Roe is to acknowledge that your view is that the will of the majority is irrelevant to this conflict that elected representatives have no power to decide these questions and that all debates about abortion must be entrusted solely to unelected judges to authoritatively decide them without regard to what majorities believe or want.

Greenwald is being quite dishonest here by accepting the conservative view that abortion restrictions are desired by a “majority” and pretending that the Supreme Court is merely allowing that majority to have its way and declining to step in the way of “democracy.” Greenwald doesn’t mention the fact that less than a third of Americans wanted Roe overturned which undercuts his assertion that “the only way” to defend Roe is to say that “the will of the majority is irrelevant.” In fact a Court that simply deferred to majority opinion would not have overturned Roe and this is not one of those cases in which the Court is being asked to thwart public opinion. Even when Roe came out polling suggested it had more public support than opposition although the decision was less popular then than it is today. Nor is Greenwald correct that the laws Roe overturned in 1973 were “democratically elected.” [sic] Most had been on the books for a century and they were made by a patriarchy. It is wrong to assume that “what state governments do” and “democracy” are synonymous in a political system like that of the United States and that’s especially the case when we talk about the laws on women’s rights that were in place at the time of Roe.

But even though Greenwald is wrong in characterizing pro-Roe sentiment as anti-majoritarian he does raise an important issue for critics of the Supreme Court. Those of us who think popular opinion should be deferred to on Roe still need to have an answer for when we think it’s acceptable for the Supreme Court to go against popular opinion. If the majority of the public wants to throw leftist dissidents in jail or eliminate the procedural rights of criminal defendants presumably in those cases we like it when “unelected judges” are standing in the way of “democracy.” In fact if public opinion was more strongly against abortion those now arguing for deferring to the pro-Roe majority would be making the case that minority rights need to be protected against majority attempts to curtail those rights. Does the selective desire for judges to respect democracy make one an unprincipled hypocrite?

I don’t think so because I think one can have a pretty consistent view of how judges should interact with public opinion. As a civil libertarian suspicious of expansions in the state’s power to criminalize and punish behavior I generally believe that judges should be deferential to public opinion when the public wants to limit the state’s right to criminalize but be willing to buck public opinion when the public is supporting the abridgment of basic liberties and the expansion of criminal punishment. So I think democracy should be deferred to most of the time and the cases where it shouldn’t are those where the democratic process is being used to create authoritarianism. This means that the court should not strip away a constitutional right and give the state a new criminalization power if the public doesn’t want the court to do this. But if the public does want the court to do that the court should be willing to slow down or place obstacles in the public’s way because criminalization powers are very dangerous. The point is that to the extent the court acts in a “countermajoritarian” way it should be in those cases where it needs to step in to safeguard individual liberties. It should certainly not be as in Alito’s opinion in a case where the court is actually stripping the public of a constitutional protection that the public would like to retain.

Samuel Alito’s leaked opinion is an atrocious piece of work both morally and logically. It is logically atrocious because it doesn’t engage with the arguments that were actually made by those who fought for the right to abortion showing why the state cannot legitimately hold the right to force someone to give birth on pain of criminal punishment. He does not appear to have read much feminist legal scholarship and contents himself with simpleminded invocations of Tradition. He seems to take it for granted that women in 2022 will give great weight to the opinions of Sir William Blackstone as to state regulation of uteruses. I cannot see how this opinion will persuade anyone who is not already a committed originalist—a position that cannot be held by any person who believes laws require the consent of the governed.

But while legal scholars tend to object more strongly to errors of logic than errors of morality Alito’s opinion is also atrocious because of the kind of unconscionable governmental repression it will enable. Criminalized abortion is a horror. Regardless of where one comes down on the philosophical question about the beginning of life the use of police and prisons to control birth is inevitably dystopian. Alito does not even discuss what this world will look like because legal originalists exempt themselves from having to think about the real consequences of their horrible decisions but nobody should want to return to the pre-Roe world which can be glimpsed in countries where abortion is presently illegal. We may indeed soon see the conservative assault widen with birth control vulnerable next. If Alito Thomas and company are serious about enforcing only those rights spelled out explicitly in the Constitution it will rapidly become clear just how inadequate a document the Constitution truly is and we will find that in order to have a livable country we need to replace both our founding document and our judges.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tZXRyb3dlc3RkYWlseW5ld3MuY29tL3N0b3J5L3Nwb3J0cy9oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC9sYWNyb3NzZS8yMDIyLzA1LzA4L2Ftc2EtYm95cy1sYWNyb3NzZS1iZWF0cy1idnQtYWR2YW5jZS1jb2xvbmlhbC1hdGhsZXRpYy1sZWFndWUtY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwLzk2NDQ3ODIwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMSA boys lacrosse beats BVT in playoffs to get closer to league title,"No commitment required.

The assets comprise workshops 1 to 23 on the fourth floor of Block A at Shatin Industrial Centre and car parking spaces V49 and V55 on the second floor of the building Hanison said Tuesday in a filing with the Hong Kong stock exchange.

Market sources tell Mingtiandi that Brookfield plans to convert the Shatin industrial units into a self-storage facility under the RedBox portfolio tapping a hot sector that has also seen a series of conversion-led acquisitions by rival investor Blackstone. RedBox executives declined to comment.

Toronto-based Brookfield quietly bought RedBox Storage from InfraRed NF in a deal that closed in March sources said. InfraRed NF is a joint venture of Hong Kong developer Nan Fung Group and British investment firm InfraRed Capital Partners which is exiting the real estate business to focus strictly on infrastructure. Brookfield representatives also declined to comment on the Shatin acquisition or on the takeover of RedBox.

Struggling for Sheds

Situated at 5-7 Yuen Shun Circuit near the City One residential precinct the partly leased Shatin property generated an annual rental income of HK$3180000 and HK$3485000 in the financial years ended 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2022 Hanison said. The developer controlled by the Cha family of Hong Kong Resorts International expects to book a gain on the disposal of HK$66.2 million.

Upon completion of the transaction Brookfield will take possession of the 34525 square foot (3207 square metre) industrial space paying roughly HK$6120 ($780) per square foot for the conversion opportunity.

The limited supply of industrial stock for sale in the market means that investors buying into strata-titled floors can still enjoy a decent return from the assets said Antonio Wu head of capital markets for Greater China at Knight Frank which did not broker the Shatin deal.

“The mini-storage business seems to be quite active in the last year and in particular Blackstone and Storefriendly have been buying en-bloc properties to convert into mini-storage” Wu told Mingtiandi. “This sector will continue to grow despite the fact that there are quite a number of players and operators in the market which offer the similar service and product hence the growth should be slower depending on the locations.”

Blackstone’s trio of acquisitions in 2021 included the Elegance Printing Centre a Shau Kei Wan property picked up from the family of late “Shop King” Tang Shing-bor for HK$500 million. That November deal followed the US private equity giant’s HK$282.6 million September purchase of Yip’s Chemical Building in the Fanling area and the HK$508 million April buy of the New Media Tower in Kwun Tong the latter property having already opened as a Storefriendly location through a joint venture with the local self-storage operator.

Self-Storage Heats Up

InfraRed NF acquired a 90 percent stake in RedBox in 2018 on the heels of a 2017 investment of $28 million in China Mini Storage a mainland-based self-storage provider.

RedBox was founded in 2014 by E3 Capital Partners a property investment firm led by Simon Tyrrell and now owns and operates five self-storage facilities in Shatin Chai Wan Yau Tong Tuen Mun and Tsuen Wan spanning more than 400000 square feet of space.

Tyrrell stepped down as RedBox CEO in early 2021 to become a board member and executive chairman focusing on the company’s strategic initiatives. His successor Tim Alpe previously served as chief operating officer of the Ovolo boutique hotel group in Hong Kong and Indonesia.

The New Territories contains the lion’s share of Hong Kong’s 690 self-storage locations with 39 percent according to data compiled by Savills followed by Hong Kong Island with 32 percent and Kowloon with 29 percent. Of the total 249 buildings are considered old with 88 percent of them having been built in 1987 or earlier presenting a potential flight-to-quality opportunity the property services firm said.",,,

The aerospace and defense firm’s employees in the region support various corporate functions and specialize in advanced airplane development and autonomous systems. In addition to designating Northern Virginia as its new headquarters Boeing plans to develop a research & technology hub in the area to harness and attract engineering and technical capabilities.

“We are excited to build on our foundation here in Northern Virginia. The region makes strategic sense for our global headquarters given its proximity to our customers and stakeholders and its access to world-class engineering and technical talent” said Boeing President and Chief Executive Officer Dave Calhoun adding “We greatly appreciate our continuing relationships in Chicago and throughout Illinois. We look forward to maintaining a strong presence in the city and the state. We also want to especially thank Governor Youngkin for his partnership and Senator Warner for his support as we worked through the process.”

Over the past two years Boeing has implemented flexible and virtual solutions that have enabled the company to reduce its office space needs. At its Chicago office less office space will be required for the employees who will continue to be based there. Boeing will adapt and modernize the workspace to better support future work requirements.

“In today’s business environment we have adopted a flexible work strategy in parts of our company and are taking steps to be more efficient within a reduced footprint. This helps us channel investments toward our critical manufacturing and engineering facilities and training resources” said Calhoun.

As part of the company’s effort to tap into engineering and technology talent across the U.S and around the world Boeing plans to establish a research and technology hub in Northern Virginia. The hub will focus on developing innovations in the areas of cyber security autonomous operations quantum sciences and software and systems engineering.

“The future of Boeing is digital” said Greg Hyslop Boeing’s chief engineer and executive vice president of Engineering Test and Technology. “Focusing our R&D and talent development in areas that support digital innovation will fuel the introduction of cutting-edge capabilities. This new hub in Northern Virginia will follow the successful implementation of this technology strategy in other regions.”

As the nation’s largest exporter Boeing employs more than 140000 people and is hiring as the commercial market recovers and the company invests in production innovation and product development. The company’s three business units will continue to be based at their current headquarters which include:

Boeing Commercial Airplanes in Seattle Washington

Boeing Global Services in Plano Texas

Boeing Defense Space and Security in Arlington Virginia

For the record Boeing won a $43 million contract for the fabrication test and delivery of four Orca Extra Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (XLUUVs) and associated support elements back in February 2019.

According to the U.S. Department of Defense contract award notice the Orca XLUUV will be an open architecture reconfigurable Unmanned Undersea Vehicle. The Orca XLUUV will be modular in construction with the core vehicle providing guidance and control navigation autonomy situational awareness core communications power distribution energy and power propulsion and maneuvering and mission sensors.

During a briefing held during SNA 2019 CAPT Pete Small former Program Manager Unmanned Maritime Systems (PMS 406) showed that the Orca program will focus initially on Concept of Operations (CONOPS) development payload integration work and mine warfare (MIW). XLUUV future capabilities may include mine countermeasures (MCM) anti-submarine warfare (ASW) electronic warfare (EW) anti-surface warfare (ASUW) intelligence surveillance reconnaissance (ISR) and even strike capabilities.

According to Covert Shores: Orca will keep the US at the forefront of XLUUV technology although Russia China and Japan are also working on XLUUV projects. Although no specifications are available one graphic used by the US Navy to represent an armed future XLUUV is particularly revealing. It shows a craft with generally the same layout as the interim Orca class with a payload module with bomb-bay like doors along the bottom. The payload bay contains three rows of four heavyweight torpedo tubes angled to fire down through the bomb bay doors. This makes the length of the payload bay about 10 meters giving an indication of the overall size.

LOUIS COUNTY — One of the biggest wins for Boeing’s St. Louis operations in a while could soon be on the chopping block.

Just a few years after kickstarting a new generation of St. Louis-made F-15 fighter jets the U.S. Air Force is outlining plans to cut its order nearly in half to 80 from 144 as they scramble to pay for next-generation priorities.

If left unchecked the proposal would cost Boeing billions of dollars in contracts and years of work for more than 1500 of its employees at a time it can hardly afford it. It’s already fighting the Navy’s push to shut down the F/A-18 Super Hornet program Boeing’s other big fighter line here by mid-decade.

“They’ve got big second-half-of-decade issues across the board” said Richard Aboulafia an analyst at AeroDynamic Advisory. “Not good for St. Louis.”

Boeing brushed off the proposal in a statement Friday calling the new F-15EX a “game changer” for the Air Force that’s already proving itself essential. “We’ll continue to engage with Congress and our Air Force customer in the years ahead to deliver on this program” the company said.

Analysts noted that Air Force priorities can change and could yet move in back Boeing’s direction.

The service has done it before. A decade ago the F-15’s days looked numbered as the U.S. and other allies shifted to Lockheed Martin’s newer stealthier F-35 built in Texas. News reports then suggested the F-15 line which began full production in 1972 could shut down by 2020.

Then in 2017 Qatar reached out with a $6.2 billion order that led to work on the updated version of the plane the EX. And the U.S. Air Force liked what it saw.

By 2019 it was announcing plans to start buying EXs to replace its 1980s-era models alleviate a fighter shortage and carry larger payloads the F-35 couldn’t. And in 2020 the service said it expected to purchase a minimum of 144 jets enough to keep the line running through the end of the decade. Boeing officials noted the contract could go as high as 200.

But not everyone in the Pentagon was on board. Some saw the plane as a spiffed-up relic of the Cold War taking away resources from more modern aircraft said Loren Thompson a longtime defense industry consultant and executive with the Lexington Institute.

This year’s budget proposal calls for an end to purchases after 2024.

“It appears they’re looking to close out the F-15 in favor of the next generation” Thompson said.

In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee last week Air Force officials said the planes were simply a casualty of competing priorities. The service has to modernize its nuclear missiles pay for a new long-range bomber and develop the successor to the F-35.

But the decision is not the Air Force’s alone. Congress will have the final say and Boeing still has plenty of supporters there.

“The F-15EX supports good-paying jobs in St. Louis and plays a vital role in meeting U.S. Air Force air superiority needs” U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt a Republican said in a statement on Friday. “As a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee I will continue working to secure robust funding for the F-15EX program.”

Boeing officials have said the new-look EX model has also attracted interest from several other countries. Earlier this year the Pentagon cleared the way for the company to pursue a deal in Indonesia. And in March a U.S. general predicted F-15s would soon be offered to Egypt.

But those would be band-aids in the grand scheme of things. The company needs a new fighter to replace its decades-old programs said Thompson the consultant.

“I hope they have some bright ideas” he said. “It may be their last shot.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9ob3ctaWNlbGFuZGFpci1pcy1ncm93aW5nLW5vcnRoLWFtZXJpY2FuLW9wcG9ydHVuaXRpZXMtd2l0aC1ib2VpbmctNzM3LW1heC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Icelandair Is Growing North American Opportunities With The Boeing 737 MAX,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9ob3ctaWNlbGFuZGFpci1pcy1ncm93aW5nLW5vcnRoLWFtZXJpY2FuLW9wcG9ydHVuaXRpZXMtd2l0aC1ib2VpbmctNzM3LW1heC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vamFsb3BuaWsuY29tL3VuaXRlZC1haXJsaW5lcy1wYXNzZW5nZXItanVtcHMtZnJvbS10YXhpaW5nLWJvZWluZy03MzctMTg0ODg5NjA3MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,United Airlines Passenger Jumps From Taxiing Boeing 737,"No matter how long a flight actually is it just feels like the time between landing and being able to step off the plane to the lengthiest part of any flight.

However I’ve never thought that the wait was long enough to consider jumping off the plane and running across the tarmac to the terminal.



At 4:30 am on Thursday morning a United Airlines Flight 2478 landed at O’Hare Airport in Chicago after departing from San Diego California. As the Boeing 737-900ER approached its gate Randy Frank Davila decided for some odd reason to open the emergency exit door. The passenger then climbed out onto the aircraft’s wing and dropped down to the O’Hare apron. The ground crew apprehended the 57-year-old Californian and also contacted local law enforcement.

A statement from United Airlines didn’t expand upon the widely reported series of events:

“This morning United flight 2478 was taxiing toward the gate at Chicago O’Hare when a passenger opened an aircraft door and exited the plane. Our ground crew stopped the individual outside of the aircraft and the person is now with law enforcement. The plane then arrived at the gate and all passengers deplaned safely. The safety of our customers and crew is our highest priority.”

His fellow passengers and even the 911 dispatcher were both stunned by what took place. I just want to know what this guy’s gameplay was when he opened that door. Did he think he could walk across the tarmac into the terminal and leave the airport? Did he only have carry-on luggage or did he plan on picking up baggage at the carousel? Well he now has to plan on appearing in court at the end of June."

The tenants association at the Bradlee Road building says all of the residents who were month-to-month — more than half the building — were given 30 days to leave.

""You're in immediate crisis mode"" said resident Liza Maloney. ""And start looking for apartments.""

Maloney who heads up the tenants association says it's impossible to find affordable housing in the area.

""I made up my mind I was going to dig in"" said Maloney.

So she's fighting to stay put.

Friday evening tenants and allies rallied in front of the building.

""Tenants should not have to do this to stay in their homes and in their community"" said Medford City Councilor Kit Collins.

City leaders have worked with management to extend the 30-day window to 60 days and longer in some cases.

But they say this is another example of property owners wanting to drive up rents and drive out people who need affordable housing.

""We're at a landscape of unprecedentedly high housing cost increases extreme housing scarcity so they had this incredibly short window to move out and nowhere to move to"" said Collins.

Atlas Group Management which owns the property says those who do have leases will likely also have to move out when their leases are up as major renovations are needed.

""We have gone through the process of removing asbestos from the property and now have moved on to upgrading all kitchens and bathrooms"" management said in a statement. ""Tenants received notice that their leases would not be renewed in order to do the work.""

Stack says she was so frightened by the termination notice she immediately started looking.

She feels lucky she's found a place but it's more expensive and 15 miles away.

""Everybody kept saying we need more time"" said Stack. ""We need more time to digest.""

Tenants who are fighting this say they hope they can negotiate a deal with management and they say they're prepared to fight this in court if they have to.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc2hlbHRlci9ob21lcy1mb3Itc2FsZS90aWZmYW55LWF5ZXItbWFuc2lvbi1ib3N0b24tc2FsZS0xNy1taWxsaW9uLTEyMzQ2Nzg0MzQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Designed by Tiffany Boston's Ayer Mansion Has Listed for $17 Million,"If you’ve already got enough Tiffany jewelry why not a Tiffany house?

The Ayer Mansion the only home in the world completely designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany the son of Tiffany & Co. founder Charles Lewis Tiffany just went on sale for $17 million in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston.

Unveiled in 1902 the five-story Gilded Age mansion spans a whopping 15600 square feet. Developers are hoping to restore it to its origins as a single-family home that features six bedrooms 13 bathrooms 10 fireplaces and a roof deck among other luxe amenities.

Despite the renovations many of the home’s original details will ideally remain in place. Tiffany took inspiration for the mansion from ancient Greece the Far East and even the Chicago World’s Fair. The impressive foyer’s white marble staircase showcases Tiffany mosaic tiles and a trompe l’oeil Greek temple is seen through the proscenium arch. Stained-glass windows and skylights beautiful plasterwork and elaborate mantels are just a few additional highlights.

“The character of the home is what really makes it special” David J. Hacin the principal and creative director of Hacin + Associates the architecture firm tasked with updating the Ayer Mansion said in a statement. “It immediately struck me as both modern and rooted in the construct of the Back Bay at the same time and that is really unique.”

The home was originally designed for the businessman Frederick Ayer and his wife Ellen who commissioned Tiffany for the design. While better known for his leaded-glass lamps Tiffany had a hand in everything from the exterior of the house to the decorative objects and wallpaper. In 2005 the property was designated a National Historic Landmark.

The Ayer Mansion is being marketed by Ruth Kennedy Sudduth and Greta Gustafson of LandVest. The current sellers are the developers Charles Reed of CNW Capital Partners and Jean Abouhamad of Sea-Dar Real Estate. The two men had initially planned to convert the property into condos but after seeing the extraordinary home and all of its historic details they thought otherwise.

“It’s a piece of art” Abouhamad told The Wall Street Journal.

And who wouldn’t want to live in this particular artwork?

BRO,Brown & Brown,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vaGVjaGluZ2VycmVwb3J0Lm9yZy9wcm9vZi1wb2ludHMtNS10YWtlYXdheXMtc2VncmVnYXRpb24tNzAteWVhcnMtYWZ0ZXItYnJvd24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PROOF POINTS: 5 takeaways about segregation 70 years after the Brown decision,"It was one of the most significant days in the history of the U.S. Supreme Court. On May 17 1954 the nine justices unanimously ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that schools segregated by race did not provide an equal education. Students could no longer be barred from a school because of the color of their skin. To commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Brown decision I wanted to look at how far we’ve come in integrating our schools and how far we still have to go.

Two sociologists Sean Reardon at Stanford University and Ann Owens at the University of Southern California have teamed up to analyze both historical and recent trends. Reardon and Owens were slated to present their analysis at a Stanford University conference on May 6 and they shared their presentation with me in advance. They also expect to launch a new website to display segregation trends for individual school districts around the country.

Here are five takeaways from their work:

The long view shows progress but a worrying uptick especially in big cities

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

Not much changed for almost 15 years after the Brown decision. Although Black students had the right to attend another school the onus was on their families to demand a seat and figure out how to get their child to the school. Many schools remained entirely Black or entirely white.

Desegregation began in earnest in 1968 with a series of court orders beginning with Virginia’s New Kent County schools. That year the Supreme Court required the county to abolish its separate Black and white schools and students were reassigned to different schools to integrate them.

This graph above produced by Reardon and Owens shows how segregation plummeted across the country between 1968 and 1973. The researchers focused on roughly 500 larger school districts where there were at least 2500 Black students. That captures nearly two-thirds of all Black students in the nation and avoids clouding the analysis with thousands of small districts of mostly white residents.

Reardon’s and Owens’s measurement of segregation compares classmates of the average white student with the classmates of the average Black student. For example in North Carolina’s Charlotte-Mecklenburg district the average white student in 1968 attended a school where 90 percent of his peers were white and only 10 percent were Black. The average Black student attended a school where 76 percent of his peers were Black and 24 percent were white. Reardon and Owens then calculated the gap in exposure to each race. White students had 90 percent white classmates while Black students had 24 percent white classmates. The difference was 66 percentage points. On the flip side Black students had 76 percent Black classmates while white students had 10 percent Black classmates. Again the difference was 66 percentage points which translates to 0.66 on the segregation index.

But in 1973 after court-ordered desegregation went into effect the average white student attended a school that was 69 percent white and 31 percent Black. The average Black student attended a school that was 34 percent Black and 66 percent white. In five short years the racial exposure gap fell from 66 percentage points to 3 percentage points. Schools reflected Charlotte-Mecklenberg’s demographics. In the graph above Reardon and Owens averaged the segregation index figures for all 533 districts with substantial Black populations. That’s what each dot represents.

In the early 1990s this measure of segregation began to creep up again as depicted by the red tail in the graph above. Owens calls it a “slow and steady uptick” in contrast to the drastic decline in segregation after 1968. Segregation has not bounced back or returned to pre-Brown levels. “There’s a misconception that segregation is worse than ever” Reardon said.

Although the red line from 1990 to the present looks nearly flat when you zoom in on it you can see that Black-white segregation grew by 25 percent between 1991 and 2019. During the pandemic segregation declined slightly again.

Detailed view of the red line segment in the chart above “Average White-Black Segregation 1968-2022.” Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

It’s important to emphasize that these Black-white segregation levels are tiny compared with the degree of segregation in the late 1960s. A 25 percent increase can seem like a lot but it’s less than 4 percentage points.

“It’s big enough that it makes me worried” said Owens. “Now is the moment to keep an eye on this. If it continues in this direction it would take a long time to get back up to Brown. But let’s not let it keep going up.”

Even more troubling is the fact that segregation increased substantially if you zero in on the nation’s biggest cities. White-Black segregation in the largest 100 school districts increased by 64 percent from 1988 to 2019 Owens and Reardon calculated.

School choice plays a role in recent segregation

Why is segregation creeping back up again?

The expiration of court orders that mandated school integration and the expansion of school choice policies including the rapid growth of charter schools explains all of the increase in segregation from 2000 onward said Reardon. Over 200 medium-sized and large districts were released from desegregation court orders from 1991 to 2009 and racial school segregation in these districts gradually increased in the years afterward.

School choice however appears to be the dominant force. More than half of the increase in segregation in the 2000s can be attributed to the rise of charter schools whose numbers began to increase rapidly in the late 1990s. In many cases either white or Black families flocked to different charter schools leaving behind a less diverse student body in traditional public schools.

The reason for the rise in segregation in the 1990s before the number of charter schools soared is harder to understand. Owens speculates that other school choice policies such as the option to attend any public school within a district or the creation of new magnet schools may have played a role but she doesn’t have the data to prove that. White gentrification of cities in the 1990s could also be a factor she said as the white newcomers favored a small set of schools or sent their children to private schools.

“We might just be catching a moment where there’s been an influx of one group before the other group leaves” said Owens. “It’s hard to say how the numbers will look 10 years from now.”

It’s important to disentangle demographic shifts from segregation increases

There’s a popular narrative that segregation has increased because Black students are more likely to attend school with other students who are not white especially Hispanic students. But Reardon and Owens say this analysis conflates demographic shifts in the U.S. population with segregation. The share of Hispanic students in U.S. schools now approaches 30 percent and everyone is attending schools with more Hispanic classmates. White students who used to represent 85 percent of the U.S. student population in 1970 now make up less than half.

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

The blue line in the graph above shows how the classmates of the average Black Hispanic or Native American student have increased from about 55 percent Black Hispanic and Native American students in the early 1970s to nearly 80 percent Black Hispanic and Native American students today. That means that the average student who is not white is attending a school that is overwhelmingly made up of students who are not white.

But look at how the red line which depicts white students is following the same path. The average white student is attending a school that moved from 35 percent students who are not white in the 1970s to nearly 70 percent students who are not white today. “It’s entirely driven by Hispanic students” said Owens. “Even the ‘white’ schools in L.A. are 40 percent Hispanic.”

I dug into U.S. Department of Education data to show how extremely segregated schools have become less common. The percentage of Black students attending a school that is 90 percent or more Black fell from 23 percent in 2000 to 10 percent in 2022. Only 1 in 10 Black students attends an all-Black or a nearly all-Black school. Meanwhile the percentage of white students attending a school that is 90 percent or more white fell from 44 percent to 14 percent during this same time period. That’s 1 in 7. Far fewer Black or white students are learning in schools that are almost entirely made up of students of their same race.

At the same time the percentage of Black students attending a school where 90 percent of students are not white grew from 37 percent in 2000 to 40 percent in 2022. But notice the sharp growth of Hispanic students during this period. They went from 7.6 million (fewer than the number of Black students) to more than 13.9 million (almost double the number of Black students).

Most segregation falls across school district boundaries

Source: Owens and Reardon “The state of segregation: 70 years after Brown” 2024 presentation at Stanford University.

This bar chart shows how schools are segregated for two reasons. One is that people of different races live on opposite sides of school district lines. Detroit is an extreme example. The city schools are dominated by Black students. Meanwhile the Detroit suburbs which operate independent school systems are dominated by white students. Almost all the segregation is because people of different races live in different districts. Meanwhile in the Charlotte North Carolina metropolitan area over half of the segregation reflects the uneven distribution of students within school districts.

Nationally 60 percent of the segregation occurs because of the Detroit scenario: people live across administrative borders Reardon and Owens calculated. Still 40 percent of current segregation is within administrative borders that policymakers can control.

Residential segregation is decreasing

People often say there’s little that can be done about school segregation until we integrate neighborhoods. I was surprised to learn that residential segregation has been declining over the past 30 years according to Reardon’s and Owens’s analysis of census tracts. More Black and white people live in proximity to each other. And yet at the same time school segregation is getting worse.

All this matters Reardon said because kids are learning at different rates in more segregated systems. “We know that more integrated schools provide more equal educational opportunities” he said. “The things we’re doing with our school systems are making segregation worse.”

Reardon recommends more reforms to housing policy to integrate neighborhoods and more “guard rails” on school choice systems so that they cannot be allowed to produce highly segregated schools.

Mandy Moore Sterling K. Brown and Chris Sullivan are ready to get in touch with their Pearson and Pittsburgh roots!

The trio is just one week away from launching their This Is Us rewatch podcast aptly titled That Was Us — and Moore Brown and Sullivan tell PEOPLE they can't contain their excitement!

""I’m very much looking forward to a Pearson family reunion"" says Moore 40 noting that they're ""excited to get everybody in the studio with us.""

""I don’t think any one of us was ready for the show to end"" continues the actress who played matriarch Rebecca Pearson. ""This show will forever hold a special place in my heart and I think a lot of people feel the same way.""

Brown who played Randall Pearson says he was in London promoting his film American Fiction when he realized the widespread impact of This Is Us.

""I realized that folks over there were kinda just discovering the show and it was moving them the same way folks in America were moved when we were on the air"" he recalls. ""And I just realized whenever folks come to it wherever they’re from they are impacted. And it made me want to revisit it again.""

Sullivan who played Toby Damon adds: ""We missed each other! Nobody was ready for the show to end when it did even though it was wrapped up to perfection. And fans were telling us that they had started rewatching and so we figured why not watch along with them? I’m excited to see everybody again and share in our love for the show.""

This Is Us aired on NBC from Sept. 2016 to May 2022. The family drama centered on the lives of siblings Kevin (Justin Hartley) Kate (Chrissy Metz) and Randall (Brown) and their parents Rebecca (Moore) and Jack (Milo Ventimiglia). The series used multiple timelines showing stories that took place in the present as well as flashbacks to the siblings’ childhood and flash-forwards to later years.

The NBC drama earned numerous accolades throughout its run. It received 39 Emmy nominations winning four. Additionally it also received the Television Academy Honors Award in 2017.

The trio tells PEOPLE they've already recorded episodes with show creator Dan Fogelman as well as Susan Kelechi Watson who played Randall's wife Beth Pearson. They also have plans to welcome Hartley and Jon Huertas (Miguel Rivas) as guests on the podcast.

The podcast — which PEOPLE can exclusively debut its new trailer — will also feature an emotional support hotline for fans to call and share their thoughts about the show and its impact.

Brown 48 says knowing how much the show has meant to people and continues to resonate is ""incredibly gratifying.""

""While the show was incredibly timely when it was on the air it also has a certain sense of timelessness. So whenever folks come to it it can’t help but move you"" he says.

Sullivan 43 echoes his costar noting ""The themes of this show are eternal and they are presented in a way that allows the audience to explore these subjects within themselves and gives them the context to discuss these topics with the people they love. The show is about connection providing its audience with the opportunity to connect.""

Moore who has since welcomed two little boys of her own says she's particularly excited to now rewatch the series from a mother's perspective.

""It’s been such a thrill to rewatch this series. The cast and the writers are just so incredibly talented that each episode has copious amounts of takeaways"" she explains. ""There’s obviously a lot of excitement in reigniting conversations that meant a lot to fans as well as excitement in reuniting and reminiscing.""

""But what I’m seeing as we rewatch is that my viewing perspective has shifted and it’s like watching it all unfold for the first time"" she notes. ""It’s been eight years since This Is Us premiered and I’ve lived a lot of life since then. I’m now a mom with two little boys and so I’m excited to rewatch all the episodes and rediscover the stories from a new perspective.""

Another special moment for the cast has been revisiting episodes of their costars who are no longer alive and honoring their legacy. (Ron Cephas Jones who played Randall's biological father William Hill died in August 2023 at age 66.)

""We try to honor Ron at every turn. Rewatching his performance is an education on acting and humanity. He is one of the most self-realized people I have ever had the pleasure of knowing"" says Sullivan.

""Oh boy it’s gonna hit hard! I can’t tell you exactly how I’ll react but it’ll be powerful. It was powerful shooting it and powerful watching it the first time"" adds Brown. ""I don’t anticipate it being any different.""

Ron Cephas Jones as William Hill on 'This Is Us'.

Ultimately the cast is just looking forward to fans finally being able to hear their new project and reigniting the bond they had for so long during the NBC hit's six-season run.

""It’s human nature for us as a society to seek connection and This Is Us connects people all around the world with the storylines themes and topics that are presented in every episode"" says Moore. ""Fans continue to watch and rewatch sharing what This Is Us means to them how it helped them navigate life differently not feel alone and even heal from trauma. Revisiting the Pearson’s stories can help us all do a bit of collective healing I think.""

""A little red faced from working in the garden"" the TLC star wrote noting that the cake -- which her daughter Madison Brush made -- was mouth watering.

On Monday Janelle shared a video of herself with her new garden and planters boxes writing ""I'll be spending a lot of the summer in NC with Maddie Caleb and the kids so Maddie and I have made big plans for a garden. I am looking forward to learning how to grow veggies in a climate that has such a long season and way more moisture than I'm used to.""

It's been a challenging few months for Janelle whose son Garrison Brown died of suicide in March at the age of 25. Garrison was one of Janelle and her ex Kody Brown's six biological children.

Last month Janelle took to Instagram to honor what would have been Garrison's 26th birthday with a touching tribute video.

""Happy Birthday Sweetheart"" she wrote at the time. ""We are missing you terribly today. It’s hard to believe you aren’t here anymore.""

The Brown family has been estranged in recent years in the wake of Christine Janelle and Meri Brown's splits from Kody. Kody's relationship with his only remaining wife Robyn Brown and his presumed favoritism toward her has also caused friction between the former polygamist and his older children.

This was thoroughly documented on Sister Wives particularly his fractured relationship with his sons Garrison and Gabriel.

ET spoke with Janelle and Christine in November 2023 about Kody's estrangement from some of his family members. Janelle said that Kody wanted to have a better relationship with his kids.

""I think that's probably the goal right? He will eventually figure out how to have a relationship with his children. I mean I hope it will over time"" she told ET at the time.

But it didn’t take Brown too long after forcing his way off the team in 2019 to start thinking differently. Even in February 2020 he already acknowledged he didn’t realize how good he had it. He discussed Roethlisberger among many topics in a recent interview with Jason Whitlock.

“Ben Roethlisberger is the best quarterback I ever played with as far as the skill level and the skill set and the intangibles of what we was able to do” Brown told Whitlock. “Like sometimes I did some stuff and Ben just he already knew what I was gonna do and he just threw the ball and laughed because he knew”.

Of course Roethlisberger and Brown had nine years to forge a connection. He never had anywhere near that length of time to build the nuances with Tom Brady that he had elsewhere. But Roethlisberger is a Hall of Fame quarterback in his own right and the numbers with Brown speak for themselves. What’s notable however is that Brown also spoke glowingly about his off-field relationship with Roethlisberger.

“We had Big Ben house playing basketball cookouts in the pool” he noted going back to his rookie season. Brown also referenced the many workouts Roethlisberger organized at Georgia University. Recalling that Roethlisberger was under great scrutiny in 2010 during Brown’s rookie season he recalled his rare relationship he built. “I was one of those players that was able to get open with him” he said.

Brown also referenced a wide variety of experiences he and Roethlisberger shared including flights on the quarterback’s private jet. This is a very different tone than the one he took while attempting to orchestrate a trade. He painted a picture of a soulless organization that didn’t care about him as a person. Today’s equivalent I suppose is unfollowing your team on social media.

Roethlisberger’s relationship with Brown though is unquestionably on the field and Brown understands what that means in terms of his legacy. “Ben is one of my best teammates. That’s one of the quarterbacks and one of the teammates I had the most fun [with] and being able to have the most success of becoming who I was because of him” he said.

But more than that he seems to regret the deterioration of the relationship they had off the field. He admits that in hindsight perhaps he “should have opened up and expressed more” during his schism from the team. Brown said that Roethlisberger is the last person he spoke to before the trade. Roethlisberger offered him very thoughtful advice he suggested.

“Big Ben was always a bright spot for me at the Steelers and somebody that always uplifted me and was there for me as a big brother” Brown said of Roethlisberger. One wonders what kind of presence he has influencing his life today. I’m sure he would like to redo many things over the past five years but life doesn’t work that way."

Caesars Entertainment spinoff VICI Properties said April 29 that it completed its $17.2 billion buyout of MGM Growth Properties the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. The deal was first announced last August and included the assumption of about $5.7 billion of debt.

As part of the sale VICI acquired several MGM Resorts-operated properties along Las Vegas Boulevard including Mandalay Bay MGM Grand The Mirage Park MGM New York-New York Luxor and Excalibur.

It also picked up several other casino properties outside Nevada including MGM Grand Detroit and MGM National Harbor near Washington D.C.

All told VICI is slated to receive more than $1 billion in initial annual rent from the newly acquired properties the firm indicated.

The buyout likely won’t result in noticeable changes at the resorts anytime soon as VICI does not operate the properties but rather collects rent from the companies that do.

Still it easily ranks among the largest real estate sales the Strip has ever seen and significantly expands VICI’s holdings in the famed casino corridor making the New York company one of the biggest property owners on Las Vegas Boulevard.

VICI now owns 10 resorts on the Strip totaling almost 41000 hotel rooms 1.2 million square feet of casino space and 5.9 million square feet of meeting and convention space company President and Chief Operating Officer John Payne said in a news release.

Company CEO Ed Pitoniak said the deal makes VICI the largest owner of hotel and conference real estate in America.

MGM Resorts which spun off MGM Growth in 2016 and was its controlling shareholder received about $4.4 billion in cash as part of the VICI buyout according to a company news release.

Operations at MGM Resorts-run properties now owned by VICI ""will continue as before for guests and employees"" MGM spokesman Brian Ahern told the Review-Journal.

NEVADA REGULATORS OK COMPANY BUYING CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT

MGM will use proceeds from the deal to invest in its ""core business"" President and CEO Bill Hornbuckle said in a May 2 earnings call adding the company would also ""continue to seek meaningful growth opportunities.""

MGM announced it is offering $607 million to buy LeoVegas a Swedish online gaming firm. It also is in the process of buying the operations side of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas for more than $1.6 billion; will begin spending on a new resort in Osaka Japan later this year; and plans to build a 1000-room resort in the United Arab Emirates.

VICI was spun off from Caesars Entertainment in 2017 as the casino chain’s main operating unit emerged from bankruptcy. By the end of that year VICI’s real estate holdings on the Strip consisted of Caesars Palace and Harrah’s a securities filing shows.

VICI was already in the process of growing its portfolio on Las Vegas Boulevard before the MGM Growth buyout was unveiled.

Casino operator Las Vegas Sands Corp. announced in March 2021 that it was selling its properties on the Strip — The Venetian Palazzo and former Sands Expo and Convention Center — for about $6.25 billion to VICI and investment giant Apollo Global Management.

Under the transaction which closed in February VICI acquired the real estate for $4 billion. Apollo acquired the operations side for $2.25 billion and leased the former Sands sites from VICI.

Since its formation VICI has completed about $29.5 billion of mergers and acquisitions and other investment activity general counsel Samantha Sacks Gallagher said in a recent news release.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGljYWdvdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8wNy9jaGljYWdvLXJvbGxzLXRoZS1kaWNlLW9uLWJhbGx5cy1oZWRnZS1mdW5kLW93bmVyLXNvby1raW0tc2F5cy10aGUtcmVicmFuZGVkLWNhc2luby1jb21wYW55LXdpbGwtZGVsaXZlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chicago rolls the dice on Bally's. Hedge fund owner Soo Kim says the rebranded casino company will deliver.,"When Mayor Lori Lightfoot named Bally’s the winner of a yearlong vetting process Thursday it ended an intense competition that saw five proposals from four development teams narrowed down to one Chicago casino.

The Bally’s proposal to build a $1.74 billion casino complex in River West is expected to generate $200 million in annual tax revenue for the city transform a 30-acre industrial site into a bustling entertainment destination and send the Chicago Tribune printing plant packing from its longtime home along the Chicago River.

For Soo Kim the 47-year-old chairman of Bally’s and founding partner of New York hedge fund Standard General the casino company’s largest shareholder staking turf in Chicago will be no less transformative.

“This matters to our company” Kim said Friday. “This is something that will be our most important property by far.”

Once a Chicago-based casino operator the Bally’s name was purchased in 2020 by Twin River Holdings a publicly traded Rhode Island company which owns and manages 14 casinos across 10 states. In June 2021 Bally’s made its entree into Illinois with the $120 million acquisition of Jumer’s Casino & Hotel in Rock Island which it renamed Bally’s Quad Cities.

Bally’s CEO Soo Kim listens May 5 2022 during a news conference announcing Bally’s Casino in River West is the pick for Chicago’s gambling complex.

Kim is looking to make Chicago the flagship of Bally’s 2.0 a hodgepodge of properties from Nevada to Atlantic City New Jersey assembled in large part during the darkest days of the pandemic.

“During COVID we went shopping and we bought 10 casinos” said Kim. “We bought the brand name as part of one of the purchases and that really changed our company in a big way.”

Born in Korea and raised in Queens New York Kim has been placing increasingly big bets on investment opportunities since graduating from Princeton. He started his career as an analyst at Bankers Trust in 1997 before working at several large hedge funds. In 2007 he launched Standard General a New York-based hedge fund that has focused on TV stations casinos and other distressed properties.

Standard General bought into the predecessor casino company Twin River after it emerged from bankruptcy in 2011. Kim joined the board in 2016 and became chairman in late 2019 as the hedge fund built up a 22% stake. A January bid by Standard General to buy out the other shareholders at $38 per share which valued Bally’s at $2.07 billion was rejected by a special committee of the board Thursday.

“It’s over” Kim said. “We made a bid. We thought that the stock was cheap. They said they don’t want to sell at that price.”

During the pandemic the casino company went on an opportunistic buying spree as casinos temporarily shuttered and valuations plummeted. In 2020 Twin River bought the aging Bally’s casino in Atlantic City from Caesars Entertainment for $25 million and also acquired the rights to the Bally’s name. The rebranded Bally’s has since invested $100 million in renovating the Atlantic City property but developing the proposed Chicago casino represents a much bigger commitment — and opportunity.

Bally’s reported $548.3 million in revenue and a net income of $1.9 million during the first quarter according to financial results announced Thursday. The company projected revenue between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion for the year.

In 2021 Bally’s generated $1.32 billion in revenue and a net loss of nearly $72 million.

The city and its casino consultant Las Vegas-based Union Gaming projected that Bally’s Chicago casino would generate $816 million in annual adjusted gross receipts — the money kept after winnings are paid out — by year six or roughly a third of the chain’s entire current gaming revenue.

Rivers Casino Des Plaines the state’s highest-grossing casino generated $458 million in adjusted gross receipts last year according to the Illinois Gaming Board.

The Chicago casino would be the largest in the state with a capacity of 4000 gaming positions — twice those allowed at any other casino in Illinois. It would also carry with it the highest casino tax rate in the state at about 40% of adjusted gross revenue.

Kim is confident Bally’s will hit its targets but some analysts are skeptical.

“I don’t think those projections will be met” said Alan Woinski president of Gaming USA a Florida-based industry analyst.

Woinski said city casinos have had a rough track record in recent years and that locations on the outskirts of cities often do better. He cited “ease of access” as the main factor in a casino’s success.

Chris Grove a partner with Eilers & Krejcik Gaming a California-based research and consulting firm said the potential market in Chicago justified the city’s revenue projections. But Grove a River North resident likewise cautioned that the Bally’s location may limit the upside.

“I think there are some serious questions that still need to be answered about how you move people in and out of that area efficiently in a way that feels like a positive experience to them” Grove said. “And as a local I don’t see obvious answers to that challenge with infrastructure as it is.”

The dog park in A. Montgomery Ward Park in the River North neighborhood sits opposite the projected casino site divided by the Chicago River May 4 2022.

The city is planning extensive roadwork improvements at the site including widening the Chicago Avenue bridge to alleviate the existing traffic bottleneck. The need to get a jump on that project derailed Bally’s plans to use a former Tribune Publishing warehouse at 700 W. Chicago Ave. as its temporary casino while Freedom Center is demolished and the permanent facility is built.

At the city’s urging Bally’s signed a letter of intent to use the landmark Medinah Temple building in River North as its temporary casino. Kim said Friday he would prefer the Chicago Avenue site and was “not crazy” about switching to Medinah Temple. Bally’s will continue to look for alternatives for its temporary casino he said.

In March Lightfoot narrowed down five proposals to three finalists: Bally’s at the Chicago Tribune Publishing Center Rivers at The 78 in the South Loop and Hard Rock at the proposed One Central development on the Near South Side.

In addition to an upfront payment of $40 million the city cited Bally’s as the only bidder that does not already have a casino property in the Chicago area making it more likely to operate independently and maximize revenues for the Chicago casino.

Florida-based Hard Rock International operates more than a dozen casinos including a Hard Rock Casino in Gary and a recently opened casino in Rockford. Chicago-based Rush Street Gaming owns four casinos including Rivers Casino Des Plaines.

The city projects that the Chicago casino will “repatriate” up to $331 million in gaming revenue that crosses the border into Indiana each year. The Chicago casino may also siphon some dollars from the competing suburban casinos.

Rivers Casino Des Plaines does not expect to lose any ground to Bally’s Chicago.

“Rivers Des Plaines is the most successful casino in the state and the vast majority of its business comes from within 20 miles of the property” Tim Drehkoff CEO of Rush Street Gaming said in an emailed statement. “Rush Street’s bid for the Chicago opportunity recognized the tremendous opportunity for the City and its selected partner to capture gaming customers heading to Indiana.”

A spokesperson for Hard Rock declined to comment Friday.

Kim said Bally’s may have “some impact” on the suburban casinos but he expects to grow the gaming market by drawing tourists to a Chicago casino.

Despite his concerns about access Grove said having a casino in the city will open the door to significant new tourism and entertainment dollars at Bally’s.

“I don’t know that a trip out to Des Plaines or a trip over to Hammond is really in the itinerary of someone coming to Chicago for a weekend or coming in for a convention for a couple of days” Grove said. “But you put a casino in the city and all of a sudden that becomes a lot easier to make.”

The Bally’s complex will include an exhibition hall a 500-room hotel a 3000-seat theater an outdoor music venue six restaurants and a casino with 3400 slots and 170 game tables. It will also feature a name with a colorful history in Chicago.

Founded in 1932 as a Chicago-based pinball manufacturer Bally’s is a storied company that diversified into everything from casinos to health clubs over the years before selling off its parts and fading into corporate obscurity in the new millennium.

Chicago-based Bally Entertainment spun off its fitness division Bally’s Health & Tennis ? then the nation’s largest chain of health clubs — in 1995. Bally Total Fitness filed for bankruptcy protection twice during the Great Recession and is now defunct.

In 1996 Bally Entertainment — the casino parent company that had properties in Las Vegas and Atlantic City — was acquired by Hilton Hotels Corp. for $3 billion including the assumption of $1 billion in Bally’s debt. The gaming division of Hilton evolved into Caesars Entertainment the largest casino company in the world.

Bally’s CEO Soo Kim right arrives May 5 2022 for the announcement that Bally’s Casino in River West is the pick for Chicago’s gambling complex.

When Kim acquired the rights to the Bally’s name in 2020 Caesars retained the name for its Las Vegas casino. But Caesars is expected to rebrand it as a Horseshoe property when Bally’s closes on its $150 million acquisition of the Tropicana in Las Vegas which it agreed to buy more than a year ago.

Kim said the Tropicana will join the fold and take the Bally’s name in the late second or early third quarter.

Bally’s still has some business to take care of before launching in Chicago including finding a new home for the Chicago Tribune printing plant.

The casino company has an option to buy the 30-acre site Freedom Center from Dallas-based Nexstar Media Group which acquired it in 2019 as part of its $4.1 billion purchase of Tribune Media — the former broadcast parent of Tribune Publishing. The Bally’s plan requires demolishing the 41-year-old plant and relocating the Tribune printing operations to make way for building the permanent casino.

Bally’s also needs to win over a majority of aldermen at the City Council and then win approval from the Illinois Gaming Board.

If approved Bally’s aims to open a temporary casino by the second quarter of 2023 with the permanent casino slated to open in the first quarter of 2026.

Kim said Bally’s is up to the challenge of building the ambitious casino complex. And he discounted suggestions that Bally’s was given a glide path to the project by the city noting the scope of the proposal doubled at the city’s behest.

“We believe very firmly that we’ve won on the merits that the city has driven a hard bargain” Kim said.

People come to Las Vegas for a lot of reasons. Some come for conventions. Some come for the magic shows Cirque du Soleil or Celine Dion. A lot of people come to gamble. Some come purely for the spectacle of it all. But everyone who comes to Las Vegas knows about the buffets.

Those legendary Las Vegas buffets — with everything from salad to sirloin — fuel the trips of more than 42 million visitors per year. Caesars Palace’s Bacchanal Buffet alone offers more than 500 food items serving more than 3500 visitors daily. The buffets are “all you can eat” but not all is eaten. Inevitably some of that food goes to waste.

And that is a microcosm of what happens at the national level. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture about 30 percent to 40 percent of the U.S. food supply is wasted. Some of that waste is caused by food spoiling but the vast majority of it is food that was purchased but not eaten like the food presented on display at Las Vegas buffets.

Food waste creates myriad economic challenges including the expense and labor involved in producing the food in the first place the fuel and transportation costs of getting it from farm to market the costs of handling and selling the food and finally the value of the food product itself. The USDA estimates the true cost of food waste at about $218 billion per year.

Simply put: Food waste as a category is a large and growing contributor to the detrimental impacts of waste on the environment and the economy. It also impacts world hunger.

Although the United States currently produces twice as much food as it needs to serve its 330 million citizens according to analytics firm SAS roughly 54 million people in the U.S. are food-insecure. In Nevada alone there are more than 373000 people experiencing food insecurity many of them children.

Las Vegas produces more than 5 billion pounds of waste per year. Most of that waste — food and all — ends up at the landfill. If all of that wasted food made its way to food pantries or shelters there would not be any hunger. The food exists to solve that problem but instead of going to good use it goes to landfills.

Given the vast amounts of food produced in Las Vegas at its more than 40 buffets and more than 4000 restaurants it is without a doubt one of the leading contributors to the abundance of food waste in the United States. The Strip alone has more than 30 resorts each with restaurants and many with buffets. Each produces food waste.

One novel method of diverting this waste from landfills in Las Vegas is the pig farm. Resorts such as Aria Bellagio Luxor and The Venetian send mountains of food waste to Las Vegas Livestock about 30 miles northeast of the city. There the farm’s 4000 or so pigs eat roughly 20 tons of food waste per day — all from the Strip. But that 20 tons is only part of the problem.

The true magnitude of the food waste epidemic in Las Vegas is likely unknowable. But given that Las Vegas consumes nearly 30 tons of shrimp per day alone the total amount of food consumed — and wasted — is colossal.

Pigs alone will not solve this problem. Las Vegas as a global leader in hospitality must commit to a more sustainable solution for dealing with food waste. More of it must be diverted from landfills and less of it must be created in the first place.

Food waste is a problem with economic societal environmental and moral implications. We must come together to resolve this crisis.

Caesars Entertainment is investing $400 million into its Atlantic City properties and Tropicana is using a portion of that to roll out eight new dining and entertainment concepts some of which will open this summer.

“I’ve spent my life many years in this business begging for capital. And this was the first time in my life I have not had to beg for capital” said John Koster Eastern regional president of Caesars Entertainment.

The pandemic as it did with most businesses forced the management at Tropicana to think differently about how they operated over the past two years and the new concepts are a byproduct of that explained Jacqueline Grace Senior Vice President and General Manager for Tropicana Atlantic City. It was also an opportunity to take a reset of “who are we and who do we want to be.”

“It’s always great to invigorate the property by introducing new concepts” Grace told NJ Advance Media during a tour of the property.

Staying is Il Verdi the Italian restaurant that has been a staple in Tropicana for 40 years. But guests looking for it at its usual location will find it in the former space that Olon once occupied. The South American restaurant with one of the best views on the property closed when the pandemic began.

“Moving it over to Olon allows us to expand it so that we can offer it to more people and then also just take advantage of the beautiful view” Grace explained.

The same large bar will still greet visitors when they enter the restauran and inside will be redesigned with a more coastal Italian feel throughout said Chris Rippy vice president of food and beverage.

Just inside the dining room where an oyster bar used to be now becomes a charcuterie and antipasti station with counter space and where people can order takeout.

The selling point will be the sweeping views of the beach ocean and boardwalk. But the food is what will keep the people coming back with its Northern Italian cuisine that will now incorporate more fresh fish into the menu Rippy said.

The bigger dining space will seat 340 people compared to approximately 100 in the old location and will open sometime this fall.

Right next to Il Verdi will be the Japanese Tavern Ossu taking the place of Okatshe which was hidden behind the back wall of a Japanese candy store.

“The concept was what’s behind the door; it was a speakeasy. And I just don’t think it translated well to our guests” said Rippy.

The plan is to take the former candy store off the front so guests can see inside “and that will give us an opportunity to expose them to what we believe is some of the best sushi in the city” Rippy explained.

Ossu will offer a unique Saki program and focus on Japanese whiskeys. When Okatshe closed in March of 2020 it had the state’s largest whiskey collection with approximately 30 to choose from said Rippy. Now the selection will expand to more than 50.

A disc jockey will set the tone Friday and Saturday nights.

Okatshe was a popular spot for happy hour and a starting point for the “Trop Hop” — where a trip to more than one of the casino’s nightclubs would follow. Rippy said they are hoping to recapture the popularity of Okatshe when Ossu opens in June.

Once Il Verdi moves its old location will become a craft cocktail bar called Hawthorne & Cork that will have bespoke cocktails fine wines and spirits.

“It’s going to be a bar lounge focused on the art of the cocktail” explained Grace.

Downstairs in Tropicana right off the Boardwalk will be two new concepts that will open sometime this summer.

Taking over the old buffet space will be Hash House A Go Go known for its twisted farm food and crafted cocktails.

The Midwest inspired food will offer a spin on comfort food that ranges from pancakes and meatloaf to burgers.

“We have Hash House A Go Go locations in Las Vegas that do really well and so we’re bringing that concept here” said Grace.

Right next door to Hash House in the space that used to be the Seaside Cafe will now be the Purple Zebra a frozen daiquiri bar that will easily allow people on the Boardwalk to pop in grab a drink and continue on their way.

Inside The Quarter will be the remaining three concepts all of which will open this summer.

Wild Honey Smokehouse and Tavern will be the first of the eight concepts to open on May 10 and will focus on barbecue traditions across the country. It takes over the former Rí Rá Irish Pub on the second floor.

“It’s classic barbecue tried and true with the twist of fun” said Tom Recine Wild Honey managing partner.

The drink program will be especially fun explained Recine with shareable drinks — the 100-ounce celebration pitchers for starters — and the visual wow effect he hopes people will get with the food and drink presentations.

Live music will fill the 5000-square-foot restaurant to help bring up the party.

“It’s meant to be a party. It’s meant to be a fun time” Recine said.

A little different atmosphere can be had right next to Wild Honey in the 10000-square-foot beer hall meets adult rec entertainment destination — Royce Social Hall which is taking over the old Providence nightclub space.

Ping pong shuffleboard bowling and cornhole will complement the large drinks and shareable food.

Downstairs where the Old Farmer’s Almanac was located will be Gin Rickey’s a live music sing-along bar with dueling pianos.

While the variety of food and beverage options will increase this year so will the spacing on the reconfigured casino floor.

“We’re creating a casino floor of the future so it’s meant to be more open and more comfortable for guests” explained Grace.

The revamped floor will include new carpet in addition to new slot machines which will be configured in pods — rather than a straight line — to create more spacing so the guests feel like they have adequate room.

Of the three Caesars properties Tropicana will be receiving the most new machines more than 280 said Koster.

“Between all of the new gaming product and then reconfiguring the floor to showcase the gaming product differently and to improve the customer experience. It’s going to be a home run” said Grace.

Unilever is the latest major company to rename the Chief Marketing Officer. Having added the word “Digital” in 2019 as “Chief Digital and Marketing Officer” they got rid of the word “Marketing” altogether last month to announce the role as “Chief Digital and Commercial Officer.”

Announcing her new role Unilever CDCO Connie Braams said:

“And no before you ask we’re not dropping marketing we’re adding sales.”

These semantic twists and turns have been happening in lots of organizations including Johnson & Johnson Lyft Beam Suntory Taco Bell and Hyatt. Other organizations like McDonalds and Coca-Cola dropped the Chief Marketing Officer title only to later bring it back.

In many of these moves new words are being adopted to signal new priorities: growth experience purpose commercial etc. Sometimes the title change reflects an org chart change sometimes not.

I think the CMO identity crisis partly reflects the nature of an historically problematic role with the lowest tenure rates across the C-suite. Some of the curse of the CMO has been the classic “Accountability without Authority” conundrum. The CMO is held responsible for results that are sometimes led by other functions in an organization.

But I think it also reflects a lack of faith in what marketing means particularly as the marketing remit continues to evolve. Some of the wording changes are more of a Band-Aid solution.

I like this insight from Rebecca Messina former Uber CMO:

“When new words are invented or others are used differently than they were used in the past it’s because new meaning is being sought. One way to get new meaning is to give it a new name. But I would argue to create the meaning then name it later.”

And this perspective from Sarah Hofstetter board member at Campbell Soup Co:

“Even if it’s just semantics changing the title may lead to removing the marketing skill set from the C-suite at a time when businesses can least afford it.”

It’s a Priority Pass restaurant so if you have your Priority Pass card from Chase Citibank or Capital One you get a $28 credit there ($56 for two people).

Bobby Van’s is one of the better airport restaurants in the Priority Pass program. While you’re supposed to have a same day boarding pass to enter that still lets you eat there both on arrival in New York and on departure as well.

In my experience they don’t actually check boarding passes just swipe your card. If I were an American Airlines crewmember based in New York I’d definitely get a credit card that offers unlimited Priority Pass visits (not from American Express which doesn’t cover restaurant visits).

Since the American Airlines terminal is underutilized throughout much of the day Bobby Van’s is quiet. Eventually British Airways will move in the terminal will pick up a bit and of course the terminal’s concessions program is turning over. But for now there’s a vast restaurant with staff just waiting for you to swipe your Priority Pass card. Everyone that was there during my most recent visit had one.

Some people do order steaks here. I’ve had the tuna burger and I’ve had the chili (which is excellent) and several other items. They may have the best airport restaurant burger you can buy in the United States. It’s actually delicious – from a nicely cooked piece of beef to excellent bun. And it’s even better when the basic burger is $25 on the menu plus tax meaning you’re really just going to pay for the tip and anything else you might add or drink.

If you have enough time to kill it’s certainly better to have a meal at Spicy Lanka in Jamaica near the airport.

It's the travel document equivalent of the new car smell — that crisp cover and unmarked pages feel like the first steps to exploring the world as a family.

However before you start planning your next great family adventure with your kids take a good look at their passports. You most likely know that kids under 16 are issued five-year passports as opposed to the 10-year ones that U.S. citizens 16 and older receive.

What you might not realize is that you most likely need to renew those five-year passports at the four-year mark. (A lesson I'm embarrassed to admit as a full-time travel journalist that I learned the hard way during spring break this year when I realized my son's passport was expiring in a month and our long-haul travel plans would no longer work.)

Why you may ask with the myriad other considerations for family travel to juggle would you need to start this process so early? Let me break it down for you month by month.

Passport validity rule — 6 months minimum

Here's something that may come as a surprise if you haven't experienced it before: Many countries require that you have a passport that will be valid for six months after entry. That means if your child's passport is set to expire six months or less from when you arrive at your destination you can be denied entry or even prohibited from boarding your flight although the airlines rarely alert you to this when you're booking.

This six-month rule is not the case for every country but it's applicable to the 26 European nations in the Schengen Treaty as well as most of South America Africa and Asia.

So if you're traveling abroad you've already lost six months from that five-year passport since you'll need it to be valid for six months past your travel date. Also you a parent who knows to expect the unexpected have probably already realized that you don't want to have exactly six months from your precise travel date so let's say seven months to be safe.

In person appointments — 2 to 4 weeks

Here's another bump in the renewal road: Children's passports need to be applied for in person — no exception — and each passport is treated as new so you can't simply renew. Additionally both parents must be present (although if one parent can't appear in person they can print out the Statement of Consent and have it notarized for the attending parent to bring along with copies of their photo ID).

Can you manage that in a week or two weeks? Nope me neither. Even if you can find a passport facility that allows walk-in appointments and your kids don't have after-school activities and you and your spouse are free you'll still need some flexibility and wiggle room to make a plan since you'll also need to get passport photos of your child before you apply at that in-person appointment. Depending on how quickly you can move this step can take anywhere from a week to a month. (Note that some passport application sites will take a photo for an additional fee.)

Processing time — 8 to 11 weeks

Passports (Photo by Clint Henderson/The Points Guy)

Let's move on. You now know you need to have your child's passport renewed before the six-month validity window and that you'll need to apply in person. So you head to the U.S. passports page of the Department of State website and discover that regular processing time is currently ... eight to 11 weeks plus mailing time on either end (the processing time starts when the agency receives your passport). Yes two to three months. If you choose you can pay an additional $60 on top of the $110 for standard processing to receive expedited service. In that case you can cut that timing to five to eight weeks. However you're still looking at possibly two months for processing in many cases even with expedited service.

Bottom line

There you have it: Start with having a seven-month validity on the passport almost three months for a renewal then another month to gather photos information and make that in-person appointment. You'll need to start the renewal process almost a full year before you thought you needed a new passport for your kiddo. The good news is you now know this in advance so you can get started well ahead of your next trip.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating a recent Covid-19 outbreak on a Carnival cruise ship that docked in Seattle after a two-week voyage.

The Carnival Spirit which sailed through the Panama Canal departed Miami on April 17 and arrived in Seattle on May 3 according to a statement from the cruise line. The ship holds 2124 guests and 930 crew members Carnival said.

The CDC says it’s not permitted to publicly share the number of passengers and crew members who quarantined or tested positive. But the ship is labeled as orange status per the agency’s cruise ship Covid-19 threshold indicating that 0.3% or more of total passengers and or crew members tested positive according to CDC’s guidelines.

The ship’s color status helps the CDC determine the scope of investigation the agency said.

Carnival Spirit is one of 62 cruise ships currently sailing at orange status the CDC said in a statement to CNN.

Both the cruise line and CDC said there were no severe outcomes or serious health issues among those who tested positive and Carnival said most guests were asymptomatic.

“Our health and safety protocols exceed CDC guidelines and were closely followed including vaccination requirements and pre-cruise testing of all guests. Our crew are also vaccinated and wear masks” Carnival said in a statement to CNN.

“Our protocols are designed to flex up as needed and additional measures were implemented during the voyage” the statement added. “In addition all guests who were scheduled to continue on with the ship’s next cruise to Alaska were tested and any guests and their traveling companions who tested positive were disembarked.”

The ship departed Seattle for Alaska later on May 3 according to Carnival’s statement.

The CDC is working with the cruise line as well as state and local health agencies to “enact existing Covid-19 agreements and protocols” the statement added.

Passengers say cruise ship was “overwhelmed”

Some passengers who were on board the Carnival Spirit alleged that crew members mishandled the Covid-19 outbreak on the ship.

Darren Siefertson who is from Las Vegas Nevada told CNN he boarded the ship on April 17 from Miami and was informed by April 26 that there was a Covid-19 outbreak on the ship.

After testing positive Siefertson said he was promised to be moved to an isolation cabin but ended up being forced to stay in the same room as his roommate.

Siefertson said when he called the medical center for an update the center had already closed before its scheduled closing time and no one was picking up the phone.

When Siefertson’s cabin mate went to guest services to ask what they should do he was told there were no more isolation cabins available and he would have to stay in the same room as Siefertson.

Ship guests also complained that room service took “hours to get food to those who were in quarantine” Siefertson said.

“There were times we ordered our food at 1 p.m. and it didn’t show up until 7 p.m.” Walter Babij who was on the cruise with his wife told CNN. Both Babij and his wife tested positive for Covid-19 while aboard the ship and quarantined in an isolation cabin.

“There were also a few times we didn’t get our complete orders. We would have to call several times to track down our food. We were completely dependent on them” Babij said.

Siefertson also complained that a few days after testing positive his cabin and two other cabins near him began to reek of sewage.

“You couldn’t even call to ask someone to fix the problem because no one would pick up the phone and we couldn’t leave our room so I had to stay in this room that smelled like a toilet. It was terrible” Siefertson said. “Carnival said they managed the situation but that is so not true. They were so overwhelmed.”

Both Siefertson and Babij told CNN they felt the cruise line was “overwhelmed.”

“I don’t think they expected that level of cases and when it got to a certain level they didn’t know what to do. It was a perfect storm” Babij said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDIxbmV3cy5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvd2UtYXJlLWNhbm9uLWNpdHkvd2UtYXJlLWNhbm9uLWNpdHktYmxvc3NvbS1mZXN0aXZhbC1mdW4tYXQtdGhlLWNhcm5pdmFsLXJvZGVvL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDIxbmV3cy5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvd2UtYXJlLWNhbm9uLWNpdHkvd2UtYXJlLWNhbm9uLWNpdHktYmxvc3NvbS1mZXN0aXZhbC1mdW4tYXQtdGhlLWNhcm5pdmFsLXJvZGVvL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,We are Cañon City: Blossom Festival fun at the Carnival & Rodeo,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.fox21news.com/features/we-are-canon-city/we-are-canon-city-blossom-festival-fun-at-the-carnival-rodeo/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDIxbmV3cy5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvd2UtYXJlLWNhbm9uLWNpdHkvd2UtYXJlLWNhbm9uLWNpdHktYmxvc3NvbS1mZXN0aXZhbC1mdW4tYXQtdGhlLWNhcm5pdmFsLXJvZGVvL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDIxbmV3cy5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvd2UtYXJlLWNhbm9uLWNpdHkvd2UtYXJlLWNhbm9uLWNpdHktYmxvc3NvbS1mZXN0aXZhbC1mdW4tYXQtdGhlLWNhcm5pdmFsLXJvZGVvL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd2ppbWFtLmNvbS9tZXJpZGlhbi1tYWxsLWNhcm5pdmFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Did You See This?

But about an hour before it all kicked off April 26 2022 the only thing everyone was talking about was news out of Carnival Corporation: Its beloved president and CEO Arnold Donald would step down August 1.

Luckily the man who helped steer his company's nine cruise lines through perhaps the toughest two-year period in its history was slated to join that vaunted panel and he didn't flinch when moderator Lucy Hockings asked him about the announcement. Instead he responded with what has become his trademark style of leadership: He calmly spoke of the excitement behind his replacement Josh Weinstein a man whom Donald has long been grooming for the position.

""I'm really excited for Josh and even more excited for me"" he said.

It's difficult to imagine Carnival Corp. without Donald 67 at the helm a position he held for nine years that saw tremendous growth and change both for the company and the industry. With Donald in charge Carnival Corp. which includes Carnival Cruise Line Holland America Line Princess Cruises Cunard [Seabourn]/cruiseto/cruiseitineraries.cfm?cl=34) P&O P&O Australia Costa and AIDA the company saw 27% growth in passengers from 2013-2019. He also brought in strong leaders with diverse backgrounds for his brands including Christine Duffy as president of Carnival Cruise Line and Orlando Ashford as president of Holland America.

Donald who will take on the role of vice chair at Carnival Corp. sat down with Cruise Critic for an exclusive interview about his time with Carnival what's next for him and what we should expect for the future of the industry.

Donald's Focus on Diversity as a Business Imperative Shaped Cruising with Carnival Corp.

Spend any time with Arnold Donald and you'll find yourself enraptured by the conversation. The man who never worked in the cruise industry before joining Carnival (though he was on the board) has an easygoing manner a deep laugh and a way of making even the most complex topics accessible to anyone.

You feel like he's listening to you. And he is. It's a strategy that long has served him well. Listening to -- and responding to -- his employees has been part of his makeup from the beginning. The former chairman of Merisant and a longtime executive with Monsanto places a high value on building community and communities.

To that end Donald has prioritized building a team of people -- a community -- that offers a variety of backgrounds and ideas.

""For businesses to thrive over time they have to innovate either in their processes or their products and services"" Donald said. ""If they don't they disappear.""

In late 2014 Donald brought in Ashford (pictured speaking) who is Black and had never worked in the cruise industry to head Holland America Line. Under Ashford HAL saw a new branding campaign that included a logo change launched two new ships wholly refurbished its fleet upped its culinary game and enhanced its entertainment offerings thanks to partnerships with the likes of Lincoln Center. Those who worked for Ashford during his tenure which ended in 2020 often talked about his ability to lead by example encourage discussions and break the rules of office politics.

Duffy (seen here with Shaquille O'Neal above) also joined in 2014 bringing with her a long tenure in travel including a stint as president of CLIA the cruising industry's largest advocacy group. Duffy's people-first approach fit in perfectly with Carnival Cruise Line's emphasis on fun and she made it her mission out of the gate to meet as many employees and guests as possible spending time on every ship in the fleet. Under Duffy the first female president of CCL the line's fleet of ships has grown to 24. Carnival also introduced the world's first roller coaster at sea and fleetwide biodigesters aimed to reduce food waste.

But Donald insists it's not just important to have a diversity of voices among leaders; it's important across all teams throughout the company -- shoreside and onboard ships. Employees represent more than 150 countries fitting as guests of the line come from more than 200 countries.

He says this can't be simply lip service.

""It's not just the diversity; it's gotta be inclusion"" he said. ""The diverse people have to have a real voice and be heard and listened to and able to influence and impact. ... When they do they have a greater probability of sustained success.""

Innovation Expanded Under Donald

Donald's approach has paid off with a number of innovations for the brands under Carnival Corp.

Perhaps the best-known is Princess's Medallion a concept Donald himself introduced to the world as keynote speaker at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2017. Along with then-Princess President Jan Swartz (now head of Holland America Group) and the man largely behind the technology John Padgett now president of Princess Donald talked about how Medallion would change the industry.

Medallion has since been rolled out on every ship in the Princess fleet and its footprint just keeps increasing. It's taking the friction out of cruising making embarkation and disembarkation easier giving passengers faster internet easing pain-points and even allowing cruisers to use their Medallion disk to make purchases in ports.

While Medallion might be the splashiest innovation Donald also points to Fathom as an example of outside-the-box thinking. Launched in 2015 and now defunct Fathom was a one-ship cruise line devoted to the concept of voluntourism and exploration. Donald appointed Tara Russell who has deep roots in social enterprise and nonprofit organizations as its president. The line was devoted to travel in two places: the Dominican Republic and Cuba previously off-limits to American travelers because of the United States' embargo against the country.

""We attempted and successfully launched but weren't able to sustain a completely different concept and brands with Fathom"" Donald said. ""What that did as an example of diversity of thinking: It gave the corporation a different image which was positive at the time but also it was the catalyst for entry into Cuba. Because we had Fathom we were able to accelerate access to Cuba when things began to open up.

""It's why we were the first company in Cuba. If we hadn't done the Fathom thing that probably wouldn't have happened.""

While talk of innovation might get Donald excited when pressed to talk about the achievement of which he is most proud he humbly pointed to making his employees happy.

""What would make me happy and make me feel like I accomplished something is if our employees said 'This is a company I'm proud to work for; this is a company whose future I believe in. It is a company that's given me the opportunity to achieve my aspirations' "" he said.

Donald said he believes this kind of achievement -- happy fulfilled employees -- ultimately is what leads to company success from creating joyful vacation experiences to exceeding guest expectations and delivering for shareholders.

It seems like his approach has worked.

Carnival Corp. was named a Glassdoor Employees' Choice Award winner as one of the Best Places to Work in 2021. The awards are given annually based on employee feedback shared anonymously on Glassdoor.

""Arnold makes the work fun and he sets the bar high but he sets the bar high for himself and then he helps you achieve it"" said Roger Frizzell Carnival Corp.'s senior vice president and chief communications officer. ""He thinks outside the box. He's got the biggest engine of any individual I've ever seen. He just goes and goes and goes but all the time he's having a good time with the people around him. He's been the best CEO I've ever worked for. And I worked for a number in my career.""

Carnival Corp. is in Safe Hands Under Josh Weinstein

That Donald and his successor Weinstein (far left) have a great relationship is clear: The two put together a video distributed to employees announcing the change. In it Donald is effusive in his praise of Weinstein expressing confidence in his leadership style and even joking about Donald's love for open-faced PB&J sandwiches.

""I am very excited to share that our boards of directors has enthusiastically accepted my recommendation that at that time Josh Weinstein our current chief operations officer will assume my current role as president and CEO of Carnival Corporation & PLC"" Donald tells employees.

Weinstein 48 has spent the past two decades with Carnival working as assistant general counsel treasurer president of Carnival U.K. and COO. Donald saw his talent early on and identified him as someone who could have a great impact on the business.

""I along with several others in our organization I purposefully intentionally did things to develop him"" he said. ""He was treasurer. I sent him over to the U.K. and he was shocked when I did it. When I first proposed that people were like 'Why? Why would you want to do that?' But then they got it and look what's happened in terms of his development and evolution.""

That the company would be in good hands as it approaches the next phase played into Donald's decision to step down August 1. Donald says there's no perfect time to do it but he feels comfortable because the fundamentals are in place.

""Things are lined up in a positive way and the team is ready"" he said.

So what does Weinstein bring to the role?

Donald calls him ""very bright"" and says people naturally like him in part because he ""remembers we're all human beings"" adding that people value his openness and transparency.

Weinstein also was an integral part of the company's approach to the COVID-19 pandemic proving he can pull people together even under the most intense of circumstances. While Donald and he have worked together closely Donald says Weinstein will bring his own flavor to the role.

""At the same time he's different than me which is important and good"" Donald said. ""That's the diversity. He's going to come at things a little bit differently.""

Future of the Company and Industry is Strong

With his replacement firmly in place Donald believes the future is bright. While the pandemic which shuttered the industry for more than a year has been an unprecedented challenge Donald thinks that some good has come out of it.

For starters he believes a long-held industry myth -- that cruise ships are ""floating petri dishes"" -- could well be dispelled thanks to the way the industry took on its return to sailing. The cruise industry has been the most stringent of all among travel and hospitality when it comes to safety protocols requiring testing vaccinations physical distancing and masks along the way.

""It's clear"" Donald said. ""We have all the data in the world that show that incidents of COVID on cruise ships ended up being far less than what you saw on land.""

As cruising has returned confidence that cruising is a worry-free form of travel is high; in a recent Cruise Critic survey 96% of people who had cruised during the pandemic said they felt safe onboard and 74% gave cruising a perfect ""5 out of 5"" saying they felt ""very safe."" This dovetails with another recent survey in which 61% of people said they felt safe on a cruise ship. This was more favorable than eating at a restaurant (57%) taking a commercial flight (44%) or attending an indoor wedding (29%).

As cruising continues to return the positive story around health and safety onboard cruise ships could finally put to an end the ""petri dish"" talk.

Donald also points to the way the industry came together to address keeping guests crew and people in ports safe and healthy as something he believes will last. Within Carnival Corp. meetings across brands happened regularly as everyone aimed for the goal of a return. But this type of communication also took place across the industry.

""If it had been a two-month crisis or a three-month crisis it would be done and over but because it's gone on for a couple of years that muscle memory is starting to take place where people are getting used to collaborating getting used to communicating ..."" Donald said. ""And so that real-time collaboration communication I think has been enhanced dramatically.""

When it comes to what he'll miss the most Donald a self-described nerd talks about tables and algorithms but also about people: He'll miss the frequent interactions he has with his team and his connection to what he calls the ""human spirit.""

Still with more time on his hands Donald is excited about one thing: He actually might get a chance to spend more time on cruise ships meeting with crew and passengers.

""I am looking forward to that"" he said. ""I can't just run around having fun all the time but the bottom line is I'll be able to spend a little bit more time onboard ships.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL2Z1bGwtY2Fybml2YWwtY3J1aXNlLWxpbmUtZmxlZXQtYmFjay1pbi1zZXJ2aWNlLzcxMTA00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Full Carnival Cruise Line Fleet Back in Service,"As Carnival Splendor welcomes her first guests in over two years today the full Carnival Cruise Line fleet has now returned to service for the first time since the industry-wide shutdown began in March 2020.

This is a momentous day for cruising and marks the successful and safe return of vacation options loved by millions of cruise travelers worldwide.

Carnival Splendor Starts Alaska Season

The Concordia-class Carnival Splendor is beginning its Alaska season on May 2 from Smith Cove Cruise Terminal 91 in Seattle Washington.

This initial cruise is an 8-day roundtrip sailing that will visit top Alaskan ports of call – Skagway Juneau Icy Strait Point and Ketchikan – as well as Victoria British Columbia.

The itinerary also includes two at sea cruising days one of which will be in Tracy Arm Fjord near Juneau where guests will have spectacular opportunities to see glaciers and wildlife including sea otters seals and whales.

“With Carnival Splendor beginning operations today from Seattle Carnival Cruise Line is thrilled to have our entire fleet of 23 ships back in service providing more opportunities for our guests to enjoy our signature fun while traveling to beautiful vacation destinations” said Christine Duffy president of Carnival Cruise Line.

“We are especially excited to expand our Alaska program this season with three ships bringing more than 100000 guests – including more than 6000 this week – from Seattle and San Francisco to awe-inspiring Alaska ports.“

Carnival Splendor will continue offering Alaska sailings from Seattle through the end of August though only this first sailing is an 8-night itinerary. The rest of the ship’s itineraries will be 7-night sailings.

Depending on the sailing date Carnival Splendor will visit either Skagway or Sitka as well as Juneau Ketchikan and Victoria and all sailings will include cruising the Tracy Arm Fjord. No other itinerary aboard Carnival Splendor will visit Icy Strait Point.

After the Alaska season Carnival Splendor is scheduled to reposition to Australia for the southern hemisphere’s summer season. The 113300-gross-ton cruise ship can accommodate 3012 passengers at double occupancy with 1150 international crew members providing fantastic service.

Full Fun Ship Fleet in Service

With Carnival Splendor‘s official restart today the full Carnival fleet is back in service. This has been a long time coming since the first Fun Ship restarted after the global pandemic shutdown of cruising.

Carnival Vista was the very first Carnival cruise ship to restart passenger operations when she set sail on July 3 2021 from Galveston Texas.

Over the past 10 months Carnival Cruise Line has operated a gradual phased restart bringing ships back into service one at a time as various ports of call have reopened for travelers.

While there have been challenges along the way with different COVID-19 variants and shifting travel guidelines the cruise line has worked closely with different destinations to restart safely not only for passengers but also to keep crew members and port communities safe.

Onboard protocols and policies have been continually updated to meet current guidance and the cruise line continues to monitor health and safety policies and recommendations to set sail safely.

Guests booked aboard any Carnival ship in the coming weeks and months should keep in touch with the cruise line to stay updated on any changes that may impact their sailing.

Ships Gone But Not Forgotten

While today is a day to celebrate the full return of Carnival Cruise Line there are ships that will be missed. During the pandemic the cruise line retired several older more outdated vessels and today’s fleet is smaller than the one that initially ceased operations in March 2020.

Five Fantasy-class vessels – Fantasy Fascination Imagination Inspiration and Sensation – were sold or scrapped during the pandemic both as a measure to modernize the fleet as well as to cut operational costs at a time when revenue was at a standstill.

A sixth Fantasy-class vessel Carnival Ecstasy is scheduled to be retired in October 2022.

At the same time Carnival Cruise Line has also welcomed new vessels during the pandemic. The award-winning Mardi Gras debuted as the fleet’s new flagship in July 2021 and her sister ship Carnival Celebration will join the fleet in November 2022."

The formation which is on a ""cross-sea area"" training exercise involved J-15 fighter jets as well as several ship-borne helicopters. Photo: Navy.81.cn

Starting a routine realistic combat training mission in the West Pacific about a week ago the Liaoning aircraft carrier group of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy has reportedly been practicing intensively over the past few days in the Philippine Sea to the east of the island of Taiwan and south of Japan a location that experts said is a vital place to stop potential external interference in event of a reunification-by-force operation in the Taiwan Straits.With the carrier group to Taiwan's east the PLA also reportedly dispatched an increased number of different types of warplanes and additional warships from the Chinese mainland west of the island of Taiwan effectively surrounding and enclosing the island under the watch of US and Japanese aircraft carriers which are serving as ""perfect practice partners"" for the PLA drills analysts said.After reporting a PLA Navy flotilla consisting of the aircraft carrier Liaoning a Type 055 large destroyer three Type 052D destroyers a Type 052C destroyer a Type 054A frigate and a Type 901 comprehensive supply ship sailed from the East China Sea through the Miyako Strait to the Pacific Ocean on May 2 Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff released monitoring reports for five consecutive days from Wednesday to Sunday. It said the carrier group conducted intensive cross-day-and-night carrier-based aircraft training with live munitions in the Philippine Sea east of the island of Taiwan and south of Japan from Tuesday to Saturday.The Liaoning carrier group was sailing slowly closer to the island of Taiwan as its drills went on the Japanese releases show.The Philippine Sea where the Liaoning carrier group is holding drills is a vital sea region should a reunification-by-force operation take place Shi Hong executive chief editor of Chinese mainland magazine Shipborne Weapons told the Global Times on Sunday.By moving in tandem with aerial and maritime forces from the Chinese mainland the carrier group could completely cut off the routes foreign forces may take if they militarily interfere with the Taiwan question and this will bring significant advantages to the PLA Shi said.Just as the Liaoning carrier group was practicing to the east of Taiwan Taiwan's defense authority reported significant increases of PLA warplane activities to the island's southwest and southeast in terms of both aircraft types and sortie numbers from Thursday to Sunday.A total of 31 PLA aircraft sorties featuring H-6 bombers J-11 and J-16 fighter jets KJ-500 early warning aircraft Y-8 anti-submarine warfare aircraft and electronic warfare aircraft as well as Ka-28 anti-submarine warfare helicopters were spotted by Taiwan's defense authority during those days.Since the Ka-28 is a vessel-based helicopter it is almost certain that there were PLA warships sailing to the west of the island of Taiwan in addition to the Liaoning carrier group in the east observers said.By featuring many powerful vessels the Liaoning carrier group is already mighty by itself. It is possible that the carrier group and the forces from the mainland were having a joint exercise testing different combinations of forces practicing and enhancing all kinds of tactics Shi said.PLA aircraft and vessels are not alone in the Philippine Sea as Japanese and US forces are also present in the region.Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff said that the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force dispatched the Izumo a de facto aircraft carrier to monitor the PLA carrier group. According to the Fleet and Marine Tracker by the news website of the US Naval Institute US Navy's Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group was also operating in the Philippine Sea at least as of May 2.They are the most realistic practice partners for the PLA because they could be the real opponents the PLA one day might have to face in the region Shi said noting that their presence could serve as excellent grindstones that can help enhance the combat capabilities of the Liaoning carrier group.While Senior Captain Gao Xiucheng a spokesperson of the PLA Navy said on Tuesday that the Liaoning carrier group's drills are not targeted at another party it is always one of the PLA's greatest goals to liberate Taiwan and achieve national reunification and all secessionists and external interferences are by default potential targets of the PLA a Beijing-based military expert told the Global Times requesting anonymity.With some of the most influential Japanese politicians making wrong remarks on the Taiwan question recently claiming that ""Taiwan's concerns are Japan's concerns"" and that ""Ukraine may be East Asia tomorrow"" and with US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi only ""postponing"" her visit to Taiwan after her alleged COVID-19 infection it is important that the PLA releases a powerful deterrent with the drills and pragmatically enhances its combat capabilities the expert said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9idXp6L3VwZ3JhZGUtdGltZS1jaGluYSVFMiU4MCU5OXMtc2hhbmRvbmctYWlyY3JhZnQtY2Fycmllci1nZXR0aW5nLW5ldy1lbmhhbmNlbWVudHMtMjAyMjg10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Upgrade Time: China's Shandong Aircraft Carrier Is Getting New Enhancements,"As China seeks to expand its power projection capabilities the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is taking major steps to upgrade its first indigenously-built aircraft carrier.

The Global Times a Chinese government-backed newspaper says that the Shandong is undergoing “maintenance and refurbishment” suggesting that the carrier will be more combat capable following the procedures. The Global Times reports that some of the carrier’s sub-systems including its arresting gear power systems pipelines and electronics have been subject to wear and tear.

However an interesting less emphasized aspect of this maintenance program is the plan to refresh the non-skid coating on the ship’s flight deck. Significantly the U.S. Navy has in recent years added non-skid coating to the decks of its America-class amphibious assault ships in order to support F-35B vertical landings. This material reinforces the desk allowing it to better withstand the heat caused by a vertical landing. In addition to applying the non-skid coating the Navy reinforced the structures below the flight deck.

Non-skid technology could help with most kinds of fighter jet landings but this development raises the question as to whether China is working on developing a copycat of the F-35B vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) fighter. China is known to be building the carrier-launched J-31 stealth aircraft but it is not known to have any fifth-generation VTOL aircraft. This could put the Chinese Navy at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to projecting fifth-generation airpower in maritime warfare environments. VTOL technology would enable fifth-generation aircraft to operate from ships with less deck space and expand China’s target envelope for maritime attacks.

Attempting to copy a U.S. platform would not be out of character for the Chinese military as the Pentagon has long reported curious similarities between some of the visible configurations and technologies in the F-35 and the Chinese J-20 and J-31 aircraft. Many public reports and Congressional papers have raised major concerns about Chinese cyber espionage.

Outside of any potential copying of U.S. strategies and technologies any enhancements to China’s aircraft carriers will be of great significance to the United States’ interests and deterrence posture in the Indo-Pacific. For example not long after the U.S. Navy conducted dual-carrier attack preparation exercises in the Pacific China used two carriers to perform the exact same exercises. China’s growing and modernizing carrier fleet presents a substantial threat to the United States Taiwan Japan and other Indo-Pacific partners and allies as it will allow China to conduct massive air-attack operations across the region.

The carrier is one of two home-ported in Bremerton.

The ship at 47 years old is nearing the end of its Naval career.

BREMERTON — The USS Nimitz departed Bremerton on Saturday for the waters of the Pacific where the ship's crew will continue training toward the aircraft carrier's next deployment.

The Nimitz's Bremerton-based crew of nearly 3000 will be joined by the ship's air wing in San Diego for preparations that include a number of assessments and inspections that ensure the 1092-foot-long warship is ready for many months at sea. Nimitz's previous deployment which wrapped up in March 2021 was nearly a year long.

And for the first time since its last deployment the ship will also reunite with its strike group a powerful flotilla of ships that includes Navy destroyers and cruisers that will sail with the ship on its next deployment.

Earlier this year the Nimitz conducted two months of training in the Pacific a journey that included 1677 landings of aircraft on its flight deck more than 26000 rounds of ammo used in live-fire exercises and saw the crew perform around 400 hundred drills.

The warship's 99000-mile deployment from April 2020 to March 2021 was hailed by Navy leaders as historic and among the longest since World War II for a carrier. After work this past year at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard the ship hit a snag in December on its first trek back at sea when the crew ""identified a minor material deficiency"" in the propulsion plant. The Nimitz is powered by dual nuclear reactors. But with repairs completed the ship got back on schedule for a deployment that's expected in the coming months

The Nimitz is one of two aircraft carriers based in Bremerton. The USS Theodore Roosevelt is currently being overhauled in dry dock 6 at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. The two are among 11 aircraft carriers in the Navy's fleet.

The Nimitz's time as one of America's mightiest warships may soon come to an end. The 1975-commissioned ship is due to be retired in 2025 though there have been discussions to extend its service life.

Q: The attached pic shows the front of a garden covered with weed fabric and decorative rock. All three Althea starting in the left foreground were luscious till mid-late last summer when the first two (left and middle) started looking bad: branches losing leaves and drying up. I watered and fertilized (sparingly) all three to no visible effect. The left-most one my pride and joy for years has completely failed to come back this spring and one of the two main trunks of the second one is also bare and dry while its other trunk is leafing out (though not nearly as early nor vigorously as the one more distant on the right ... that one is trying to conquer the world). Unsure as to No. 1's demise I scraped the bark bent stems and branches for rigidity looking hard for signs of viability. Just can't tell. I'm prepared to dig up and replace No. 1 but want to be sure it won't come back (especially since all three were treated the same in virtually identical growing conditions). Advice?

A: Rose of Sharon or Althea is usually a tough plant. It can suffer from several root diseases especially in poorly drained soils. Without seeing it in person I can't say for certain but I do not think it is going to survive. I talked with the University of Arkansas plant pathologist and she would like a sample of the roots and some of the wood. If you are cutting it down see if there is any brown streaking in the stems especially near the base. If you can take the samples in to your local county extension office she can test for disease and tell you what to do for the other plants and whether you should replace them with something else.

Happy memories of violet flowers

Q: When I was younger my mother and I would walk around the woods of Hall High campus in Little Rock. There was a wildflower -- I am thinking a type of violet -- that grew around the trees. They were purple with 5-6 petals. Randomly one petal on a flower would be dark velvety purple. My mom would tell me that an angel had kissed that flower. Do you know what this flower would be?

A: What a sweet memory. I would guess the plant is a wild violet Viola sororia. Depending on where it is growing it can be a wildflower or a weed. It is in full bloom now in many lawns and gardens and while it is pretty it can be highly invasive.

Selective pruning could help lopsided Japanese maple

Q: This Japanese maple was damaged when the tree trimmers came through our neighborhood for Entergy a couple of years ago. They dropped a large branch on the tree and it sliced all the branches off down one side. I've been watching for new growth on that side and there isn't any. Is there anything I can do to promote growth on the side without any branches? I am worried that as it matures it may be more susceptible to wind damage because it will be heavier on one side. The tree is finally getting some height and I would hate to lose it.

A: With selective pruning you can direct branches to grow in the direction you want them to. If you prune a branch back to a node that faces in the direction you want new growth the resulting new growth should grow in that direction. While you don't want to cut it down and start over you can see a few branches are starting to head in that direction now from other limbs. It will take time but you can also head it back a bit from the top again pruning to a node that grows in the direction you want. It will take time but you can help to shape it.

Woolly caterpillars aren't long for these parts

Q: We are being invaded by woolly caterpillars all over Hot Springs. I'm assuming they come from those small white webs on the trees. Are they harmful and what are they?

A: Yes they are associated with the white webs in the trees. They are Eastern tent caterpillars. Luckily they are short lived. They can eat a lot while they are active but they should be gone in about two weeks and the trees will recover. Very young small trees can be damaged but most trees are not significantly harmed.

But there are reasons for optimism. Rainy conditions in May and June could support a fungus that kills browntail moth caterpillars and researchers this summer will test several other ways to control the insect.

Still Mainers shouldn’t count on a reprieve this year said Tom Schmeelk an entomologist with the Maine Forest Service.

“I’m hoping that the rain will be prevalent and plentiful in May and June to collapse the population but I’m expecting the worst” Schmeelk said. “And people should plan for it to be the same as last year.”

Maine is in the middle of a browntail moth outbreak that began in 2015. Experts say it likely will take multiple years of rainy spring weather to end it.

However this year brought some surprising news. The Maine Forest Service found dead caterpillars outside the winter nests indicating the nests were infected with the fungal disease last fall said Angela Mech assistant professor of forest entomology at the University of Maine. Neither Schmeelk nor Mech had seen that before.

Experts previously thought the fungal disease only affected spring caterpillars but now believe a rainy fall can help knock back the browntail moth populations.

The brown caterpillars which have white stripes on their sides and two orange spots on their hind end sparked national interest last year. Their tiny hairs can cause a skin rash similar to poison ivy and remain toxic for up to three years.

They pose the greatest risk between April and July when the larger caterpillars are active.

The Maine Forest Service conducts spring and fall aerial surveys to estimate tree foliage damage from the moths. And in the winter Forest Service teams drive around and estimate the number of winter webs per tree in a given stretch of road. (Click here to view the 2022 winter survey.)

These surveys indicate that last year’s hotspots — such as Lewiston Auburn Turner and Manchester — likely will have it rough again this year Schmeelk said.

Last summer the moths damaged an estimated 200000 acres of forest although Schmeelk said it likely was more than that. Bad outbreaks in the early 2000s rarely reached 20000 acres.

“The changing climate and us having more of a tendency for drier springs and longer summers that extend into fall are both conditions that favor browntail” Schmeelk said. “Who knows what that might mean for the next outbreak after this but this outbreak is definitely a few orders of magnitude greater than we’ve seen in the past few decades.”

Mainers do have options for addressing browntail moths in their area. The preferred option is to remove winter webs from trees but it’s already too late for that this year. Trees also can be injected or sprayed with pesticides. It’s currently the right time for injections but spraying will have to wait a few weeks until more leaves on trees. More information can be found on the Maine Forest Service website.

Portland will spray its trees between May 16-20. The city said a winter survey found “results that were improved from last year but still concerning.”

Researchers are studying other ways to control the pest including testing a variety of targeted biopesticides that could have fewer harmful impacts on other species said Mech the UMaine professor. Many current options are considered “broad spectrum” which means they can harm beneficial insects as well as browntail moths.

Her students also are helping her test which types of lightbulbs are least attractive to browntail moths at night by releasing the moths in a dark tunnel and recording which light they flock to. The results will lead to recommendations for homeowners who see the moths cluster around their outdoor lights.

Last summer Mech and her colleagues tested different types of traps using pheromones chemicals that alter sexual and other behaviors. This summer at about 20 sites around the state they will use those traps to begin monitoring population density which will eventually create a model that can predict outbreaks. In collaboration with the University of New Hampshire additional traps in New Hampshire Massachusetts and some Maine islands will give an idea of populations across the region.

Also a field trial this year will test different concentrations of the female pheromone to create a “plume” at various distances to confuse the male moth. The theory is that releasing a cloud of the female pheromone in the air will make it difficult for a male moth to find a female mate to reproduce.

Mech said she feels optimistic about all these projects but they are still in the early days and it could be a while before they become large-scale trials.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYWRpbGxhY25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvZXhwZXJ0cy1zYXktc3Bvbmd5LW1vdGgtYWN0aXZpdHktbWF5LWJlLW9uLXRoZS1kZWNsaW5lLXRoaXMteWVhci1hZnRlci12ZXJ5LXJvdWdoL2FydGljbGVfNWJkNTVkNzYtY2IwNS0xMWVjLTk0OWItODc3MWE0ZTgzY2Q2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Experts say 'spongy moth' activity may be on the decline this year after very rough 2021,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

Pictures from a hedge near Underhill Lane Clayton show the webbing coating an entire bush.

Similar sights have been spotted across the country over the years with a species of very hungry caterpillar previously said to have been the culprit. Small ermine moth caterpillars have been attributed to the phenomenon as a method of protecting themselves from predators.

Whilst readers who are squeamish about bugs may not wish to look too closely within the webbing you can see hundreds of tiny caterpillars nestled together. After time spent within the webs the caterpillars will grow into nocturnal moths and last from July to August.

Last year the same occurrence was witnessed along almost 100ft of a Yorkshire hedgerow. At the time Dr Phil Sterling from the Butterfly Conservation charity told the BBC that the webbing was ""a very impressive infestation"".

He added that the numbers of caterpillars ""get enormous every now and then"" with tens of thousands living in a hedge. However Dr Phil added there was ""no danger no threat"" and it was merely done ""to avoid predation"".

Small ermine moths are known to have a creamy white body with black spots. Looking at the webbing In Clayton this appears to fit the bill.

They can affect a number of plants including hawthorn apple trees sedum and most commonly bird cherry. The caterpillars will feed under the thick silk webbing of these plants eating their leaves and stripping them almost bare - though the trees and bushes should survive.

(Image: Martin Burton/SussexLive)

Over the summer months of July and August the adult moths will emerge and mate before laying eggs from which larvae hatch usually taking place in late August and over the winter. They begin feeding again in spring which is where the silk webbing comes from.

As they begin their journey into adult moths the hundreds of caterpillars will pupate within the webbing and continue to feed and strip the plants of their vegetation. They then emerge as adult moths and the cycle continues into the next year.

The webs are said to be created for the protection of the caterpillars although they are not thought to have too many predators. This webbing thus allows them to devour almost an entire bush with little hindrance."

Accenture’s Seabury air cargo consultancy in the Netherlands appears to have experienced a mass walkout after five former managers set up a new company Rotate.

Rotate’s website explains that its aim is to help airlines turn data into action.

“We target all domains that drive the commercial performance of airlines: from sales optimisation and dynamic pricing to revenue management contract management and revenue leakage.”

The company added modestly: “We don’t have the ambition to disrupt the entire industry we simply would like to help airlines do 3 to 7% better.

“With our unique mix of cargo strategy consulting and tech experts we help airlines to create workable solutions to monetise earlier investments in data and systems and bring a fresh point of view to topics that have proved frustratingly tough to crack.”

It is unclear who remains at the Dutch arm of Seabury which was bought by Accenture in 2017 with many key names now at Rotate including Ryan Keyrouse Jonathan Mellink Lars Meijs and Ronald Veldman.

Gert-Jan Jansen Rotate’s founder (pictured above) left Seabury in 2020. Only Rotate’s tech entrepreneur and engineer Lauren ten Hoor was not formerly at Seabury.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Almost as soon as the last putt drops at the 2023 Charles Schwab Invitational work will begin on a major renovation of the Colonial Country Club course. Hanse calls it a historic restoration.

Greens will be torn up. Bermuda grass in the fairways and rough will be killed and eventually replaced with sod. Trees will be removed and others trimmed. New irrigation and drainage lines will be dug. Much of what exists now will be replaced.

If the golf course were a house it would be like tearing everything down to the studs.

“The hardest part of the project is that we can’t start — give or take — until June 1” said Hanse one of the hottest names in golf course architecture. “It’s a very tight timeline.

“It’s a very very tight window and we hope that Mother Nature is kind to us.”

Hanse spoke by phone last week from Frisco where he was on a site visit to the PGA Frisco course he designed that is scheduled to host the 2027 PGA Championship. Among his other recent work is the course in Rio de Janeiro Brazil that hosted the 2016 Olympics a renovation of Tulsa’s Southern Hill Country Club which will host next week’s PGA Championship and a renovation of The Country Club in Brookline Mass. which will host the U.S. Open in June.

“Even though we have a year” he said “we really only have six months of good growing weather.”

The restoration which was announced on the eve of the 2021 Schwab Challenge was to have begun at the end of this year’s tournament which begins May 26. It was pushed back a year when it became clear that supply chain issues could cause disastrous delays.

“We had to ensure that we would have the materials we needed when we needed them” said Frank Cordeiro Colonial Country Club’s COO and general manager. “We have a very well-defined timeline which doesn’t allow for delays.”

The decision to delay the $20-plus million project was the right thing to do he added.

The master plan of Colonial Country Club shows the plans for the 2023 renovation of the golf course. The renovation was originally planned to begin in 2022 but was pushed back one year. (Hanse Golf Course Design)

“Having a defined inflexible plan requires us to do certain things. Our plan is to have the course ready for the event. If you don’t know you can get it done you don’t do it.”

If the Schwab Challenge continues to occupy the Memorial Day weekend dates the 2023 event would end May 28 and the next tournament would begin May 22 2024.

Some of the above-ground changes will be subtle. Tournament regulars over the last three-quarters of a century will recognize Hanse’s touch.

The project required his team to do extensive research on the course that was founded in 1936.

“We did a lot of digging to find the true design of Colonial” Hanse said. “There are so many iterations of Colonial over the years.”

Among the early prominent architects were John Bredemus Ralph Plummer and Perry Maxwell.

In their research Hanse’s team found Nos. 3-5 the Horrible Horseshoe was the primary contribution of Maxwell and did not originally include all the bunkers that currently exist.

Hanse plans to remove a fairway bunker and two greenside bunkers on No. 3. The greenside bunkers on the par-3 No. 4 would also be removed as would the greenside bunkers to the left of the par-4 No. 5. Smaller trees have already been removed on the right side of No. 5 to put the Trinity River in view if not also in play.

“It’s a win-win for members and PGA Tour players” Hanse said of removing bunkers because it makes it more playable for members and the bunkers don’t normally come into play for Tour players.

“We’re trying to get it back to something that looks like it’s been there forever” he said.

The restoration balances the needs of the members with the challenge of testing PGA Tour pros who visit one week every year.

“Because we focus so much on history I think it’s generally members first” Hanse said. “Ultimately we’re working for the members. But the identity of Colonial is tied to the tournament.”

Although work won’t begin for more than a year a timeline has been established for tasks to be completed. First on the list are the green complexes Hanse said. It takes about a week to get the subterranean cooling and heating system in place shape a green and plant the grass for each green. If all goes according to plan that work should be completed by August.

Colonial got a bit of a head start. The pump station for the subterranean system is already installed. The hydronic units control temperature and moisture level and will create ideal conditions for bentgrass greens’ health and growth.

Colonial hired Rich McIntosh as director of agronomy in December 2021. He had been at Torrey Pines in San Diego. He has experience in hosting major professional tournaments and PGA Tour events. And he has been a part of major construction projects.

The most dramatic changes will be to the par-3 holes particularly Nos. 8 and 13. No. 8 originally played with the Trinity River on its right side. Hanse will create a mirror image to the original design by moving the green closer to the creek and barranca on the left. The tee box will be moved forward into a valley creating an uphill hole.

No. 13 originally played with an oxbow of the Trinity River in front. That look will be restored. The green will move farther from the pond. The wall that currently separates the water from the green will be removed. A bunker will be added at the edge of the water.

“The evolution of the golf course was a more formalized landscape” Hanse said of the refinements made over the years. “We’re restoring the rustic patina. We’ll give it more of a sense of place a river’s edge Texas landscape.”

If all goes according to plan it will make its debut in 2024.

Charter Communications Nike and Salesforce.com are the top three companies that paid no taxes despite billions in income in 2020 according to research conducted by Tipalti a global business consulting company with offices in California and Texas.

Each of the top 10 companies ranked by income that paid no taxes actually had negative tax rates because of millions they received in tax rebates Tipalti said.

The following chart shows the corporations with biggest pre-tax income that paid $0 in taxes the amount the companies got back in rebates and other payments and the effective tax rate according to Tipalti.

In other research Tipalti found that the most common tax violation corporations were charged with was failure to pay taxes. For the tax year 2020 286725 penalties were issued for a total in funds to be repaid of $589 million. Only 59 fraud penalties were issued against corporations and only $7.9 million in fines were assessed

Failure to pay taxes that are owed also is the most common offense for individuals and trusts with more than 19 million penalties issues and $7.1 billion in back taxes and fines collected.

“The volume of unpaid taxes is equivalent to about three-quarters of the entire annual federal budget deficit and this is how much the U.S. misses out each and every year through unpaid taxes” Tipalti said in its report “Tax Offenses: The World’s Biggest Tax Offenders.”",,,,,,,,,

(CCI). The remaining 35% of CCI will continue ownership under Bunge and Chevron.

In its Aug. 3 announcement Bayer said this investment delivers on the company’s commitments to sustainability and can help decarbonize agriculture and reduce reliance on nitrogen fertilizer with combined expertise of existing investors Bunge and Chevron. Bayer said that advancing ownership in CCI a Leaps by Bayer portfolio company since 2015 underscores the value of nurturing and supporting breakthrough innovations. CCI will continue to operate as an independent entity.

Founded in 2013 St. Louis Missouri US-based CCI is converting field pennycress a common winter annual using plant breeding to improve yield and maturity combined with advanced gene editing tools to improve fiber and oil composition. CoverCress is a rotational cash crop that combines grain production with the environmental benefits of a cover crop without displacing other harvests such as corn and soybeans.

“CoverCress is exciting because it has the potential to become an important source for biofuel production as a new harvested rotational crop while giving growers an innovative option to continue effective stewardship of their land and improve soil quality by acting as a cover crop” said Rodrigo Santos member of the board of management of Bayer AG and president of the Crop Science Division. “As a global leader in crop science we are committed to decarbonizing agriculture and helping farmers around the world become more sustainable through game-changing products and solutions that can impact climate change. This investment and collaboration between industry leaders is another proof point for our efforts.”

Aligning the combined expertise of Bayer Bunge and Chevron with the potential held by CoverCress will position CCI to further develop and commercialize its namesake winter oilseed into a rotational cash cover crop with potential sustainability and carbon sequestration benefits and bring a new lower carbon fuel feedstock to the renewable diesel industry.

“Since our founding in 2013 we have actively sought – and benefited from – scientific operational and financial support from our academic and strategic partners” said Mike DeCamp chief executive officer and president of CCI. “The progress we have made in converting pennycress into our novel lower carbon intensity oilseed technology CoverCress would have been much slower without this critical support. Our long-standing strategic partnership with Bayer and our more recent strategic partnerships with Bunge and Chevron have provided us with access to expertise and capital that positions CCI very well for future success.”

By leveraging expertise and backing from leaders in fuels soybean crushing logistics and crop sciences CCI will be positioned to deliver on its full potential via a supply chain that understands its crop’s production growth processing and delivery needs from the ground up.

Under a commercial partnership between CCI and Bunge announced in April CCI will supply CoverCress grain produced under contract with farmers to Bunge for processing. The strategic partnership among Chevron Bunge and CCI will create a dedicated farm-to-fuel supply chain for the low-carbon intensity oil feedstock produced from CoverCress grain.

“Connecting the full value chain – from seed development to end consumer – is an important step to bringing this crop to market at scale” said Greg Heckman chief executive officer of Bunge. “We look forward to helping meet the growing demand for renewable fuels with this next generation lower carbon feedstock.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA1LTA3L2JpZy1vaWwtc3BlbmRzLW9uLWludmVzdG9ycy1ub3Qtb3V0cHV0LXByb2xvbmdpbmctY3J1ZGUtY3J1bmNo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Big Oil Spends on Investors Not Output Prolonging Crude Crunch,"Why did this happen?

Shell's adjusted earnings for example rose to $9.1 billion while Exxon Mobil reported $5.48 billion in profits.

Rising prices have boosted the profits of major energy companies further contributing to global inflation and the cost-of-living crisis.

As households around the globe struggle with rising energy bills some of the world's leading oil giants reported record profits for the first three months of this year.

Profits for Exxon Mobil Shell and more also rose by billions despite significant costs of exiting operations and/or investments in Russia amid war in Ukraine.

After Russia invaded Ukraine in February the price of oil climbed in 2022's first quarter – as countries that rely heavily on Russia for energy scrambled for alternative fuel sources amid uncertainty.

The benchmark for global oil prices Brent crude averaged at $102.23 a barrel during the first quarter – 67% higher than during the same period last year according to the Associated Press. In the United States for example drivers have consequently found increasingly expensive gas prices at the pump.

Home heating bills and electricity prices also inflated worldwide – as natural gas prices climbed from $3.50 per million British thermal units to about $5.60.

High oil and gas prices have boosted the profits of major energy companies further contributing to global inflation and the cost-of-living crisis.

The net profit margin of S&P 500 companies which include energy giants such as Chevron and Exxon Mobil in the first quarter has been running at 12.3% based on estimates and earnings reported so far according to FactSet. That’s down from a peak of 13.1% in the second quarter of last year but above the pre-COVID-19 level of about 11%.

“Profit margins should be coming down” Lindsay Owens executive director of Groundwork Collaborative a progressive economic policy research group previously told USA TODAY.

Instead she noted “they’re actually growing.”

Here's a breakdown of the profits and earnings some of the world's oil giants made in the first three months of 2022:

►Price gouging:Critics say corporate greed is making inflation worse citing record profits despite rising costs

Shell earnings rise to $9.1 billion

In the first quarter Shell's adjusted earnings rose to $9.1 billion from $3.2 billion in the same period last year. Net income rose to $7.3 billion from $5.8 billion in last year's first quarter.

Shell said that it would also take a $3.9 billion charge to cover the cost of exiting investments in Russia which the London-based energy giant pledged to do after the invasion of Ukraine.

BP records $6.2 billion profit

BP posted its highest quarterly profit in over a decade – with the British energy company announcing on Tuesday that its underlying replacement cost profit rose to $6.2 billion in the first three months of this year more than doubling the $2.6 billion from the same period last year.

BP PLC also said its net loss in the first quarter totaled $23 billion after accounting for a write-off of its nearly 20% stake in Russian oil producer Rosneft in response to the Ukraine war.

Both BP and Shell's recent profit reports have contributed to calls in Britain for the government to impose a tax on energy companies’ windfall earnings in hopes of helping consumers struggling with rising energy prices. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has rejected the idea  saying the tax would reduce investment in Britain during efforts to diversify the country's energy industry.

The British government’s “refusal to tax the super-profits of energy companies is completely unforgivable when people are too terrified to heat their homes” Ed Davey leader of the Liberal Democrats told the Associated Press.

Exxon doubles profits from last year to $5.48 billion

For the second time in less than two months Latter-day Saint women have taken to social media to push back against an address delivered by a top female church leader.

Speaking on Friday at Brigham Young University’s Women’s Conference President Camille Johnson leader of the global Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encouraged women to rely on the words of President Russell M. Nelson and emphasized the need for women to prioritize motherhood.

“My primary orientation — that is my focus passion and calling as a woman — is toward motherhood” Johnson a former corporate lawyer said. “That is our primary orientation our sacred calling as daughters of Heavenly Parents.”

The Salt Lake Tribune submitted questions to a church spokesperson for the 60-year-old Johnson including how she and her husband managed child care while they both worked and her advice for Latter-day Saint women interested in pursuing a career but who feel guilty for doing so. No responses were provided.

“I had babies and my husband and I loved and nurtured them while we were both working” Johnson told her worldwide audience Friday. “It was busy sometimes hectic. We were stretched and sometimes tired. I supported him and he supported me. Family was and still is our top priority.”

Senior apostle Dallin Oaks Nelson’s top counselor in the governing First Presidency and next in line to lead the 17.2 million-member faith spoke on similar themes in a 2023 devotional. The 91-year-old father of six warned young single adults against delaying marriage and childbearing even for financial reasons.

He was among the first to comment on the church’s Instagram post quoting Johnson’s talk calling the Relief Society president a “wonderful role model.”

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and wife Kristen speak to young adults at a worldwide devotional broadcast in May 2023. The couple urged young adults to stop delaying marriage and parenthood.

Some commenters however worried the call to prioritize motherhood could leave women particularly vulnerable to financial insecurity.

“Approaching 40 I have seen enough faithful LDS women abandoned by their husbands and left to care for their children — all with weak educational degrees starting from scratch and barely scraping by” wrote @anniemangelson. “Too many women and children end up in absolute crisis having simply ‘followed the prophet.’ We have to quit teaching like this and setting some women up for failure.”

And as many commenters pointed out Johnson’s own decision to pursue a career conflicted with previous prophetic counsel discouraging women from work that took them away from their husbands and children.

“I’m grateful for this message and example” said user @jsmileybug. “However I’m 25 and this is the very first time I’ve EVER heard a church leader suggest it’s acceptable for [mothers] to work outside the home.”

What Kimball and Benson said

(The Salt Lake Tribune_ President Spencer W Kimball of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sits with apostle Ezra Taft Benson. Both leaders urged women to put motherhood ahead of careers.

Some of the more than 2000 comments pointed to the words of former President Spencer W. Kimball spoken in 1977 and shared a decade later during a Brigham Young University fireside by then-President Ezra Taft Benson as the kind of clear direction Johnson would have heard — and not heeded.

“No career approaches in importance that of wife homemaker mother — cooking meals washing dishes making beds for one’s precious husband and children” Benson quoted Kimball as saying. “Come home wives to your husbands. Make home a heaven for them. Come home wives to your children born and unborn.

Several Instagram commenters cited rhetoric like this as their own reason for forfeiting careers and instead having children sooner than they otherwise would have — decisions some said they now regretted. To have Johnson who chose otherwise now lauded as a role model they said was painful to watch.

One user @oils4us wrote that she was in the audience when Benson delivered his dramatic address. Taking the message to heart she said she proceeded to give birth to three children in three years.

“I used to get the BYU alumni magazine and every time I’d cry and feel sad because where was my paragraph?” she wrote. “Where were my accolades for having done what” Benson instructed?

Seeing Johnson praised now she said brought back that same ache.

“The women” she said “who went against the prophet’s very direct counsel get their paragraphs and fulfillment of becoming something else and a mom.”

Neither was the impact of such rhetoric constrained to a single generation.

“I’m sobbing reading this” commented the 35-year-old Linda Hamilton who in an interview with The Tribune said she gave up her dream of becoming a writer to devote herself to her family.

These days she mourns “for younger me. She gave up all her dreams and ambitions because she truly thought God would only accept her if she obeyed the prophets exactly.”

It’s not that Hamilton who lives in Southern California doesn’t want the church to celebrate working women. Rather she wishes Johnson and other church leaders would acknowledge that doing so represents a major break from the past.

Hamilton is hardly alone.

The ‘right thing to do’

(The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Relief Society General President Camille Johnson speaks at the European Union Parliament in Brussels in March 2024 on religious liberty for women.

“This would have been an even more beautiful message if it was coupled with an apology” wrote @ariabethards “to all the women who listened to President Benson and other prophets who pressured women into letting go of education and career dreams to stay home as housewives.”

Others meanwhile didn’t seem to know what to think in response to the talk.

“I’m starting to feel so confused” wrote @jameeandelin. “On the one hand I’m so happy that Camille Johnson listened to her own intuition and authority to make decisions for her life. …But I know someone who was not given a temple recommend because they chose to work instead of stay at home at the time. It’s so unfair. I don’t get it.”

Still others saw in the sermon an opportunity to emphasize the importance of following Johnson’s example and carving one’s own path.

“Let this celebratory post of a woman in the church choosing to go against the brethren” @edge_of_inside wrote “stand as a shining example to the rest of us that following our own personal revelation and authority will always be the right thing to do.”

The comments are reminiscent of the more than 13000 responses engendered by a church Instagram post from late March quoting a sermon by Johnson’s first counselor J. Anette Dennis.

In her speech and the associated post Dennis stated “There is no other religious organization in the world that I know of that has so broadly given power and authority to women.”

The women represented in the comments were less convinced arguing that their experience in the patriarchal faith did not align with Dennis’ description.

Last year Guardian Australia revealed the widespread use of stay applications to permanently halt civil cases brought by survivors where perpetrators had died.

The Catholic church and other institutions effectively used the passage of time to block survivors from having their cases heard by arguing a fair trial was no longer possible.

The tactic was adopted despite clear evidence before the royal commission that significant barriers meant survivors took on average 22 years to come forward and that institutions had themselves hindered justice by concealing abuse from law enforcement and destroying records.

The high court delivered a significant blow to the use of stays in November finding they must only be allowed in rare and exceptional circumstances or risk bringing “the administration of justice into disrepute”.

Legalise Cannabis Party upper house MLC Jeremy Buckingham is preparing to introduce a bill to state parliament to enshrine the high court findings into statute law and remove any uncertainty around the way stay applications can be used.

It introduces changes that would limit the ability for a defendant to argue for a permanent stay simply because of the passage of time. The bill would also allow survivors who had a stay granted against them since 2016 the ability to have their cases reconsidered.

Buckingham said he was aware of about a dozen cases that had been permanently halted due to stays in that time period.

“We want justice for victims of child sexual assault” Buckingham said. “That’s what we want.”

“We want to ensure that they get their day in court in the civil court and that what I think [of as] this cunning ‘lawfare’ is removed as a tactic from institutions.”

Survivor Matt Barker said the legislation would be “enormously beneficial” for those who were still pursuing justice through the courts.

Barker’s own case against Scouts NSW was stayed last year despite the fact that his abuser was alive had been convicted of criminal offences against Barker and was willing to give evidence.

Barker appealed and has since settled but said he was “aware of other organisations still using the threats of permanent stays” against other survivors.

“[The legislation] would be enormously beneficial for anyone who has a live case and it also has provisions for anyone whose case was closed due to a stay or because of the threat of a stay to allow them to re-litigate their case” he said.

“From that point alone it’s super important legislation because there will be so many people out there who have accepted minute settlements.”

The government has previously indicated support for amending the law to enshrine the high court’s findings.

In November Buckingham moved a motion recognising the court ruling and to “consider enacting legislation to amend the Limitation Act 1969 to remove this roadblock to justice once and for all”.

The government said at the time that it “supports the motion as it asks for the government to consider mechanisms and changing statute law which we will do”.

Buckingham said the government was yet to act so he was introducing the bill to force change.

A spokesperson for the attorney-general Michael Daley said the government had not yet seen Buckingham’s bill and had not been able to consider its contents.

(KSLA) - Daniel Wimberly said he’s glad he took a chance after noticing social media posts that rapper Torence “Boosie” Hatch had been seen in Shreveport.

Wimberly and his wife Shantina were at a concert in Frisco Texas when they heard that the Louisiana rapper had been spotted. Not knowing whether he would respond Daniel sent Boosie a message inviting him to attend service at Greater Pleasant Grove Baptist Church.

“Daniel my husband always invites everyone to attend church with us. To us it was all about the ministry” Shantina said.

That Sunday Daniel was setting up when he spotted Boosie and his fiancée entering the church.

“While I was playing drums I was shocked because we are a small neighborhood church and here is this national recording artist who doesn’t even know me walking in to visit.”

Wimberly said he revealed at the end of the sermon that he was the one who invited Boosie. Wimberly thanked Boosie for coming and invited him to prayer.

“I told him ‘God bless him.’ Boosie smiled and you can see he was overjoyed. Then our pastor called him up to the front and asked him if he would like to say anything and Mr. Hatch asked for prayer” Wimberly recalled.

He said will never forget the conversation he had with Boosie after church.

“This means a lot to me he is one of my favorite artists and I grew up on his music. You never know what a person is going through so that’s why it’s good to reach out and invite someone to God’s house.”

“We love having our space open almost recklessly open for the neighborhood” the Rev. Kevin Deal St. John’s vicar told Episcopal News Service. Serving its community “has been part of the DNA of St. John’s almost since its inception 164 years ago.”

St. John’s provides space for more than just sleeping through its partnership with the Gubbio Project a nonprofit organization that serves unhoused people with “safe compassionate respite during the day” according to its website.

The project takes its name from an Italian town where according to legend St. Francis of Assisi brokered a truce between a hungry wolf and frightened townspeople. The nonprofit was founded in 2004 and moved into space at St. John’s in 2017.

Lydia Bransten Gubbio’s executive director since 2021 told ENS that the legend embodies what her organization is about. “When people come together with mutual need we find commonality and can work together” she said.

Their response shines a light not only on homelessness in general but on how communities across the country seek to address it. Homelessness has been on the rise across the United States since 2017 and cities have grappled with how where and even if to provide shelters or housing. A lawsuit against Grants Pass Oregon for its decision to fine homeless people for sleeping outside on public property made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court for oral arguments on April 22.

According to the Associated Press one-third of the country’s unhoused population live in western states like Oregon and California. The San Francisco Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing’s 2022 Point-in-Time count found more than 7700 unhoused people in the city with more than 4000 of them unsheltered. The 2024 count is due out this summer.

While unhoused people have existed in America since the 17th century their needs have grown more acute than ever since the COVID-19 pandemic Bransten said. Homeless people in San Francisco who weren’t gravely disabled or seniors “were basically left out on the street” and with shelters closed encampments sprang up so people could find some safety in being together. There were few services available and many people watched others die of an overdose. “There was a lot of trauma in those years” she said.

“The result is a community of people who are distrusting who are more ill and fentanyl addiction collided with COVID in a way that has been debilitating for that community” she said.

A recent assessment of homeless people living in the Mission District found that before COVID 68% of them were employed and had housing she said. Immigrants make up a large portion of the area’s population and many lost their jobs as office building cleaners or restaurant workers during the pandemic. Loss of a job often meant loss of housing.

Now when St. John’s opens its doors each weekday about 35 people come to sleep and over 100 more arrive for the supportive services Gubbio offers. With no pews in the nave it’s easy to set up cots with blankets and people are welcome to bring their belongings and their dogs inside with them. Couples can arrange their cots to be near each other which usually isn’t permitted in shelters Bransten said. “The only rule is to just stay peaceful” she said.

In other parts of the building people can get a cup of coffee or see one of the nurses who provide foot and wound care. The city’s Department of Public Health’s street medicine team provides health screenings and follow-up appointments. Gubbio’s harm reduction specialist who also is a treatment counselor provides clean needles and other paraphernalia so those using drugs can do so safely.

“That provides an entrée to a conversation with a person who is struggling with drug use” Bransten said. Recovery from addiction always is the end goal but “we need to keep them alive long enough and love them enough until they are ready to love themselves into recovery.”

Bransten said that St. John’s offers a space for Gubbio’s clients that is both sacred and safe. “Not all sacred spaces feel safe” she added. “A lot of people have experienced a level of spiritual violence and St. John’s is an incredibly healing community.”

Deal and some of his parishioners provide pastoral care to those who come to the church for Gubbio’s services and many of them now attend worship services at St. John’s something Deal says he loves. “We don’t think of them as people from Gubbio” he said “they are just folks in the St. John’s community.” He said that because people are familiar with the church and think of it as their space they feel comfortable coming back on Sunday.

Bransten said St. John’s building itself helps the people Gubbio serves. “The beauty of the space is key to the way we’re able to create an environment where people feel welcomed where they feel like it’s peaceful it’s beautiful and it’s for them.”

“This is exactly who the beauty of God’s house is intended” Deal said. “It’s not for the people who have everything. The beauty of God’s house is for the people who are down and out.”

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) -- From Irwin to North Braddock to Ross Township multiple types of disruptions impacting church services have taken place throughout the Pittsburgh area within the last several weeks.

One of the incidents involved a gun pulled on a pastor during a sermon while another consisted of vandalism impacting an organ and sound equipment.

New federal funding has been approved to help increase security for places of worship and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says that all types of churches are welcome to apply.

Places of worship can apply for funding through the Nonprofit Security Grant Program and can use the funds for whatever they would like as long as it helps add security. The deadline to apply for funding is May 21.

""I thank God because only God stopped and jammed this gun.""

A man was arrested in North Braddock on Sunday after pulling a gun on a pastor during his sermon at the Jesus' Dwelling Place Church -- and it was all caught on camera.

Bernard Polite is facing attempted homicide and aggravated assault charges and is accused of trying to shoot and kill the pastor.

As the pastor ducked out of the way Polite was tackled by a deacon and held down on the ground until police arrived.

Police are also investigating after a man was found shot to death in Polite's home near the church. It's unclear if he is responsible for that shooting.

""All churches are sacred places which should be treated with respect.""

A church in Westmoreland County fell victim to vandalism late last week and is looking for help identifying the teenagers responsible for the damage.

As a result of the vandalism the church was unable to use the organ for the first two Holy Communion masses the following morning.

""It was an important sacramental day for our parish and the children and their families were affected by the two teenager's actions"" Father John Moineau. ""All churches are sacred places which should be treated with respect.""

The church is now asking for help identifying the two teenagers and say that information will be turned over to Irwin Police.

""It would be nice if people could just practice their religions in peace.""

Last month a man was reported to be walking into nearly a dozen area churches includes St. Sebastian Church in Ross Township and yelling at a priest that he was the devil.

Parishioners said that these type of incidents are especially disturbing because the man's intentions weren't clear.

The Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh is working with multiple law enforcement agencies to track down the man."

The senior more than made up for it Friday in another winner-take-all game.

Roewe’s two-run home run snapped a 7-7 tie in the fourth inning and she went 4-for-5 with five RBIs as the Maidens blasted McCamey 17-7 in six innings in the Region I-2A one-game area playoff.

“I did awful last game but I had more confidence today and I knew I needed to hit for us to win” Roewe said. “So I tried to do that.”

Roewe tripled in a run and scored for a 2-0 Haskell lead in the first inning and her two-run single sparked a five-run fifth. Yet it was the go-ahead homer that really got the Maidens rolling.

“We finally came alive in the dugout a little bit” Haskell coach Toby Allen said about Roewe’s homer. “They started bringing a little bit of energy and we fed off it. We had been waiting for something big to happen there. We let them hang around with us and we finally got a big hit to get us going.”

Roewe got plenty of help from her teammates.

Olivia Camacho had two hits including a double and three RBIs while Laney Hanson went 4-for-5 with two RBIs and four runs. She had a double and triple. Alyssa Stocks went 3-for-4 including two doubles and drove in a run while scoring twice. Mia Williams (2-for-4 double two RBIs) Savanna Camacho (3-for-4 RBI run) and Harley Medford (2-for-4 two runs) also contributed to the Maidens’ 21-hit effort.

Nyla Baeza led McCamey with four hits and three RBIs and Piper Day had three hits an RBI and a run. The Lady Badgers had 13 hits.

“All credit to McCamey” Allen said. “They came out ready to play. They put the ball in play. We hadn’t seen anyone hit the ball like that against in quite a while.”

Williams won the game in relief of starter Savanna Camacho. After giving up three runs in the third inning Williams settled down to throw three scoreless innings. She gave up six hits struck out five and walked two in four innings.

“She’s been the one that’s pitched the most of our innings this year” Allen said of Williams. “Savanna the one I started she pitched all eight innings of our extra-inning win last week. Did a great job. So did Mia today.”

Savanna Camacho allowed four runs on seven hits in two innings. She struck out one and walked one.

Dallas Jaramillo went the distance for McCamey giving up 17 runs on 21 hits. She struck out seven and walked none.

After Haskell scored two runs in the first inning McCamey scored four in the second inning. The lead didn’t last long. Haskell scored five runs in the bottom of the seventh before McCamey tied the game with a three-run third.

It stayed that way until Roewe’s blast to center field. Hanson tripled in a run and scored in the fifth before Haskell ended the game with a six-run sixth. Roewe ended it with an RBI single.

“She did a good job” Allen said of Roewe. “She was 0-for-4 last week. Played a great game in the outfield on defense but she was due for a big game this week. She did a great job of seeing the ball and picking out the pitches she wanted.”

Haskell advances to play defending state champion Stamford in the region quarterfinals next week.

Stamford beat Haskell twice in district play this season – 15-0 in three innings in the first meeting April 1 in Stamford and 9-0 on April 22 in Haskell.

Stamford won the District 7-2A title while Haskell was fourth. The Maidens have two hits off Stamford ace Citlaly Gutierrez a University of Texas signee this season.

“Citlaly does a great job of throwing strikes and really battling pressing batters to put the ball in play” Allen said.

While the Maidens face a daunting task next week Allen hopes they enjoy getting to play another week.

“I keep telling the girls every day in practice that we’re living on borrowed time right now” Allen said. “Every practice we get is extra lives for us. We’ve got to keep making things happen every week.”

Mute is not what you think

Most of us use the Mute button to mute the surrounding sound while making video calls with others but it seems that everything we believe is correct as a new study indicated that pressing the mute button in popular video conferencing applications such as Zoom Google Mate Slack Skype and others may not work in Reality is as you think and these apps continue to listen to what you have to say in flagrant violation of privacy.

According to the study users and I first believe that the Mute button when activated cuts the audio permanently but pressing Mute does not mute the audio or prevent the transmission of audio to the application servers. That is the application continues to capture your voice and transmits it to the servers but does not send it to the other party.

How does the mute system work?

We have to understand how the mute or mute system works so that we are aware of everything. At first for video conferencing applications to work you need to get permissions to access the microphone but at the same time they can listen to what you say when the Mute button is active and the reason is not known and may do so in order to collect data improve the service and to notify the user that the audio is muted.

Results

Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Loyola University at Chicago conducted a comprehensive binary analysis of the uptime of a given number of video calling apps to determine what kind of data each app collects and whether that data poses a privacy risk.

The apps tested in the study were Zoom Slack Skype Google Mate Discord Cisco WebEx Blue Jeans Werbie GoGoMeeting and JitsiMate. Click on the ""Mute"" button.

The researchers found that if the mute button is activated all apps collect audio data from time to time except for people who use the service through a web browser. In all cases the apps sample audio intermittently for various or unclear reasons.

As for the famous Zoom video calling application the most widely used in the world it was found that it listens to what the user says even when the mute button is turned on but the worst was the Cisco WebEx program which continued to transmit sounds from the user’s microphone to its servers despite the activation of the mute button in the same way that It works out when the mute button is not activated.

Serious security problem?

Even if we accept that these apps collect limited random audio data when the audio is muted the researchers note that this data can be used to decode what the user is doing 82% of the time via a simple machine learning algorithm.

Even if video conferencing applications secure their servers encrypt data transmissions and are committed to protecting that audio data any external attack could leak those audio files and only us would be the victim.

Also keep in mind that video calling applications are not limited to us but are used by important personalities such as company managers politicians and employees of sensitive positions in the country so if this data is leaked it will be disastrous for everyone.

How to protect yourself and your privacy

Of course we press the Agree button on any policy without reading how these programs deal with our data. However there are some steps that you need to take in order to protect privacy such as:

Don't read everything just the information about the Privacy Policy in order to better understand how to manage your data and the risks involved in using that service.

If the microphone is connected to your computer via a USB cable or jack you need to disconnect it even after pressing the mute button.

You can use your operating system's audio control settings to mute the microphone input channel in order to prevent apps from getting any sound.

Do you use video calling apps and what will you do to protect your privacy tell us in the comments

Companies are offering these benefits as the landscape of state and federal abortion policy in America is shifting. Texas implemented the country’s strictest abortion law last November when it banned abortion after six weeks of pregnancy and deputized citizens to enforce the rule. Other states including Idaho Florida and Oklahoma have passed laws in recent months tightening access to the procedure.

Earlier this week a leaked Supreme Court draft opinion indicated the court may be preparing to overturn Roe v. Wade the 1973 precedent that established a constitutional right to an abortion.

The 67-page draft first reported on Monday by Politico declared that Roe was ""egregiously wrong and deeply damaging.""

Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement Tuesday that the draft written in February wasn’t necessarily the final resolution in the case. The court is expected to issue its opinion by the end of June or early July.

FTC TO REVIEW MUSK'S $44B TWITTER BUY UNDER ANTI-TRUST: REPORT

If Roe v. Wade is overturned it would open the door to stronger state restrictions including bans on the procedure.

Companies offering to help employees travel to get an abortion may be on safe legal ground for the moment but that could change.

Texas’s abortion law extends liability to abortion clinics and doctors as well as those who aid an abortion. Oklahoma and Idaho have passed similar legislation. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt enacted the law this week and Idaho’s law was temporarily blocked in court. Some lawmakers meanwhile have pushed back on the new company policies.

Here a look at some of the companies who have expanded benefits:

Tesla

Tesla TSLA -0.87%▼ which announced the relocation of its headquarters last October to Austin Texas said in its 2021 ""Impact Report"" that the company has an expanded ""health insurance offering that includes travel and lodging support for those who may need to seek healthcare services that are unavailable in their home state."" Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment Friday.

Amazon

Amazon.com Inc. headquartered in Seattle told employees it would reimburse up to $4000 annually for travel expenses for medical treatments including abortions that employees can’t access within 100 miles of their homes.

Citigroup

Citigroup Inc. in a proxy filing for its April shareholder meeting said that starting this year it is offering travel benefits for employees to seek resources due to changes in reproductive healthcare laws. More than 10000 full- and part-time Citi employees live in Texas.

Yelp

Yelp Inc. based in San Francisco is offering employees and their dependents financial assistance through insurance if they need to travel out of state for abortion care. Yelp’s YELP -4.34%▼ health insurance currently covers abortion care.

Apple

Tech giant Apple Inc. which is expanding its presence in Austin with a new $1 billion 3-million-square-foot campus also said its health-insurance policies cover abortion services and travel fees if necessary.

Levi Strauss

California-based Levi Strauss & Co. has said it would reimburse medical travel expenses for full-time and part-time employees.

Russia supplies a quarter of Brazil’s fertilizers and sanctions meant to punish Moscow for its invasion threatened to trap the crucial commodity from being exported. That posed a danger not only to the Brazilian economy but also to the world’s ability to feed itself.

Within days Brazilian officials warned farmers to cut back on a critical fertilizer and experts forecast that the country — one of the largest exporters of corn soybeans sugar and coffee — had just three months before it ran out.

Now two months later Brazil is replenishing its fertilizer stockpiles — with help from Russia. Much like the Russian gas that has been flowing through pipelines into Europe hundreds of thousands of tons of Russian fertilizer have arrived in Brazil since the invasion.

Wade big companies already have a precedent for effective action,"Abortion rights campaigners march through downtown after demonstrating outside of Evo A. DeConcini U.S. Federal Courthouse in Tucson Arizona U.S. May 3 2022 after the leak of a draft majority opinion written by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito preparing for a majority of the court to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade abortion rights decision later this year. Picture taken May 3 2022.

The corporate world is being monitored for what it is saying — or not saying publicly. Among corporate giants who have been mum on the issue  some may be concerned about stepping into a political landmine or angering certain constituents. But experts in corporate social responsibility say that despite these concerns it's important for companies to address the issue of reproductive rights head on.

As the abortion debate intensifies some corporate activists are urging companies to take prompt action to adopt more favorable reproductive rights policies ahead of any action by the Supreme Court. ""Right now it's a ripple but it will become a wave and once Roe is overturned it will become a tsunami"" said Andrew Behar CEO of As You Sow a non-profit shareholder organization.

With the Supreme Court draft decision leak increasing the likelihood of Roe v. Wade's demise companies are under pressure to adopt more favorable employee policies with respect to women's reproductive rights.

""Public companies whether they like it or not are in the spotlight for this debate"" said Carla Bevins assistant teaching professor of business communication at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business. ""They will continue to set the example for other businesses"" she said.

Some companies have publicly urged other businesses to take a stand. ""Given what is at stake business leaders need to make their voices heard and act to protect the health and well-being of our employees. That means protecting reproductive rights"" Levi Strauss & Co. said in a May 4 statement.

To be sure taking a stand on a polarized issue such as abortion presents challenges for companies who are dealing with multiple constituents with differing opinions. That said the message companies send doesn't have to be ""overtly political"" said Martin Whittaker CEO of Just Capital a research nonprofit which measures and seeks to improve corporate performance on environmental social and governance factors. ""If you're focusing on it as a health benefit issue that's probably the safest ground"" he said.

That's what Citigroup did for example and its CEO explained the company's stance in response to a question posed at its annual shareholders' meeting on April 26 about its policy of paying for employee travel related to seeking an abortion. ""We know this is a subject that people feel passionate about. I want to be clear that this benefit isn't intended to be a statement about a very sensitive issue"" CEO Jane Fraser said at the time.

Companies for years have been insuring abortion and changing their policies now is consistent with that said Shelley Alpern director of corporate engagement at Rhia Ventures which invests in reproductive health-care solutions that empower women. ""They should take action now to mitigate what's coming"" she said.

Yelp in a statement provided to CNBC called on Congress to codify the rights of women to make decisions over their own bodies. Yelp also said companies should ""step up to safeguard their employees and provide equal access to the health services they need no matter where they live.""

Furthermore company policies that pay for travel when it is required to receive health care are not limited to abortion with Amazon among those noting coverage for travel related to many conditions from cancer care to mental health and substance abuse in cases where there is no medical option within a 100-mile radius of an employee's home.

For many years Citi has offered a travel benefit that typically enables employees to access specific health-care services such as transplant bariatric or orthopedic procedures outside their local area.

""What we did here was follow our past practices"" Fraser told shareholders. ""We've covered reproductive healthcare benefits for over 20 years. And our practice has also been to make sure our employees have the same health coverage no matter where in the U.S. they live. So to that end we've had a practice of reimbursing travel for many years. We respect everyone's views on this subject"" she said.

This approach to employee health benefits has been used by Walmart for years which has partnered with ""centers of excellence"" around the country to provide health-care services and travel and lodging expenses to employees for conditions including bariatric surgery spine and heart health cancer care and other conditions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdGhld2Vlay5jb20vZmVhdHVyZS8xMDEzMjg3L3doZXJlLW1ham9yLWNvbXBhbmllcy1zdGFuZC1vbi1hYm9ydGlvbi1yaWdodHMtdGhlLXNjb3R1cy1sZWFr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where major companies stand on reproductive health care policies,"It's becoming increasingly difficult for companies to remain silent on controversial social issues — take the bitter LGBTQ-related standoff between The Walt Disney Company and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) as a recent example.

The latest blurring of the lines between business and politics however was sparked by the leaked draft majority opinion suggesting the Supreme Court is poised to overturn federal abortion rights as protected under 1973's Roe v. Wade. Here's where tech giants and leading businesses stand so far:

Airbnb: 'We will work to make sure our employees have the resources they need'

In a request for comment regarding the leaked opinion and its resulting expected effect on employee healthcare vacation rental company Airbnb told The San Francisco Standard that the company's ""healthcare coverage supports reproductive rights and we will work to make sure our employees have the resources they need to make choices about their reproductive rights as we committed to last fall"" in the wake of Texas' extreme six-week abortion ban.

Amazon: Up to $4000 a year in travel expenses

Amazon the nation's second-largest private employer has offered to cover up to $4000 a year in travel expenses for employees seeking non-threatening medical care including abortions if said care is unavailable within 100 miles of their residence and virtual care is not possible.

Apple: 'Actively monitoring the legal proceedings'

Tech giant Apple which has a large presence in Texas has said its health insurance covers both abortions and related travel fees. It appears Apple's policy has been in place since at least September 2021 when it confirmed to TechCrunch that it was keeping an eye on the legal challenges surrounding the Texas ban.

""We are actively monitoring the legal proceedings challenging the uniquely restrictive abortion law in Texas"" Apple wrote in an employee memo. ""In the meantime we want to remind you that our benefits at Apple are comprehensive and that they allow our employees to travel out-of-state for medical care if it is unavailable in their home state.""

Bumble and Match Group: 'We believe strongly in women's right to choose'

Online dating app Bumble commented on Monday's draft leak the following evening. ""The headlines today regarding the leaked draft opinion to overturn abortion rights in the United States are profoundly unsettling"" the company wrote on Twitter. ""At Bumble we believe strongly in women's right to choose and exercise complete control over their bodies.""

In September both Bumble and fellow dating app service Match Group separately announced they would each be launching relief funds for Texas employees in need of out-of-state abortion care. ""As I have said before the company generally does not take political stands unless it is relevant to our business"" Match Group CEO Shar Dubey said in a memo at the time. ""But in this instance I personally as a woman in Texas could not keep silent.""

Citigroup: A target of House Republicans

In March Citigroup became the first major bank to announce it would pay travel costs for employees affected by the abortion ban in Texas where it employs over 8000 workers. ""In response to changes in reproductive health care laws in certain states in the U.S. beginning in 2022 we provide travel benefits to facilitate access to adequate resources"" the bank said in a filing.

Citigroup subsequently came under fire for its decision; House Republicans urged the U.S. to cancel government contracts with the bank and a Texas lawmaker threatened to introduce a bill preventing Citigroup from underwriting municipal bonds.

CVS Health: 'We've made out-of-state care accessible and affordable'

In response to a request for comment on the draft opinion from Fortune CVS offered the following: ""We're monitoring the situation closely and evaluating how we can best support the coverage needs of our colleagues clients and consumers. We've made out-of-state care accessible and affordable for employees in states that have instituted more restrictive laws.""

Levi Strauss: 'Business leaders need to make their voices heard'

""Given what is at stake business leaders need to make their voices heard and act to protect the health and well-being of our employees"" Levi Strauss wrote in a statement released Wednesday. ""That means protecting reproductive rights."" The clothing brand is also reimbursing employees for travel expenses incurred while seeking health-care services unavailable in their state including abortions. Part-time hourly workers are able to seek reimbursement as well.

Salesforce: Helping employee families relocate out of Texas

Software company Salesforce offered in September to help employees and their families relocate out of Texas following the passage of its abortion law.

Salesforce did not take an explicit stance on the Texas law in its statement CNN noted at the time.

Uber and Lyft: Creating legal defense funds

Both Uber and Lyft each announced in September they'd be creating legal defense funds to help drivers sued under the Texas law which financially incentivizes and deputizes private citizens to sue anyone who aids or abets an abortion (including ride-sharing drives) after six weeks of pregnancy. Both companies recently extended the same coverage to drivers in Oklahoma.

Lyft also previously pledged to donate $1 million to Planned Parenthood. ""We've made our perspective on this quite clear"" Lyft co-founder and President John Zimmer told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday after the leak. ""So we will continue to look for ways to make a difference to speak out and to most importantly take action.""

UTA: 'The right to choose … has been a bedrock'

Hollywood's United Talent Agency also responded to the draft ruling by notifying its employees it would reimburse travel expenses related to reproductive health services unable to be accessed within their state. ""We're doing this to support the right to choose that has been a bedrock of settled law for almost half a century"" CEO Jeremy Zimmer said in a memo to employees. ""Several states have already introduced restrictive legislation and the draft Supreme Court ruling leaked yesterday if it comes to pass could make abortion illegal in more than half of the country.""

Yelp: 'Turning back the clock … will have a seismic impact'

Online review website Yelp has been outspoken in its opposition to an overruling of Roe warning such a decision from the court would have a ""seismic impact on our society and economy.""

""Turning back the clock on the progress women have made over the past 50 years will have a seismic impact on our society and economy"" Yelp continued in its statement on the matter. ""This goes against the will of the vast majority of Americans who agree that decisions around reproductive care should be made by women and their doctors."" The company also called on Congress to codify Roe into law.

Prior to the Monday evening leak Yelp had announced it would be covering expenses for employees and their spouses who must travel out of state for abortion care. The policy arrived in response to a restrictive six-week ban out of Texas but the benefit extends to employees in other states as well. Mirian Warren the company's chief diversity officer has said Yelp is not concerned about backlash.

Per a Wednesday report from The New York Times businesses who appear yet to directly comment on the draft ruling include PricewaterhouseCoopers Oracle JP Morgan Chase Walmart Disney ThirdLove Patagonia Kroger and Meta (though Sheryl Sandberg did post on Facebook writing that ""this is a scary day for women all across our country"").

It seems Microsoft has also stayed silent on an expected Roe reversal though company co-founder and billionaire Bill Gates weighed in on Twitter:"

The Phillies are looking to bounce back after an embarrassing collapse during Thursday’s game against the Mets. The Phils were three outs away from a win but instead gave up seven unanswered runs in the 9th inning to throw away what had looked like a certain victory.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9waGlsbGllcy9waGlsbGllcy1tZXRzLWJyeWNlLWhhcnBlci0yMDIyMDUwNy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'We all needed to hear that': Inside Bryce Harper's speech to the Phillies after their historic loss to the Mets,"Phillies Bryce Harper rounds third base as he celebrates his solo home run against the Mets during the 4th inning at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia Thursday May 5 2022 Read more

Bryce Harper walked into the Phillies clubhouse Thursday night not long after his team’s bullpen had blown a 7-1 lead to the Mets in the ninth inning. It was one of their worst losses in recent memory and his teammates were still reeling from it. So Harper decided to hold a players-only meeting.

The meeting lasted no longer than a minute but the 2021 NL MVP got to his point quickly.

“He basically said this doesn’t define us” third baseman Alec Bohm said. “Obviously nobody wants that to happen. This sucks right now but we can’t let it affect tomorrow or the next day or the next day. We play 162 games. If we waste a couple of games because we’re feeling bad about how Thursday went that’s not a good recipe for success.

“It was one of those situations where we needed to hear something. I think we all needed to hear that.”

Thursday’s night loss to their division rivals marked the Phillies’ fourth straight defeat and their fifth loss in their past six games. The Phillies are now 11-15 and seven games behind the first-place Mets in the NL East standings. According to Elias Sports Bureau the Phillies’ loss Thursday was only the fifth time in their 140-season history in which they’d lost after leading by at least six runs in the ninth inning or later.

Outfielder Matt Vierling described the team as “in shock” after Thursday’s loss but said Harper’s words resonated with them especially since they came from a team leader. Harper through a team PR representative declined to comment on his postgame speech.

“He believes in this team” Vierling said. “He knows how good we are. This kind of stuff happens. He said it’s time for us to put it behind us and move on.”

It’s likely that no one felt Thursday’s ninth inning collapse more than reliever James Norwood who allowed four hits and four earned runs (including one home run) in just one-third of an inning pitched. Norwood struggled to locate his pitches in that outing. He was trying to hit the corners but instead found his pitches crossing over the middle of the plate and low in the zone.

“Instead of throwing to my strengths I was focusing on hitting the glove” he said of his outing Thursday. “Next time I’m going to approach it just using my strengths. I know where I need to throw my stuff for it to work well. The way my fastball works I have to get it up in the zone and instead of just focusing over the middle of my the plate maybe up in the zone and on the corners more. With my splitter to lefties it works better where it’s arm side and low and to righties it would be glove side and low.

“Harper said stuff like this is going to happen and it’s true. It’s about how we take it and how we move forward. Just use it to build and not go backwards.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1jYWxsLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA1LzA3L2Jhc2ViYWxsLW5vdGVib29rLWxlaGlnaC12YWxsZXktY2FycGVudGVyLWN1cC10ZWFtLXNldC10by10YWtlLXNoYXBlLWZvci1hbm90aGVyLXRpdGxlLXJ1bi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Baseball notebook: Lehigh Valley Carpenter Cup team set to take shape for another title run,"The Eastern Pennsylvania Conference and Colonial League baseball tournaments begin next week and if you wanted a breakdown of the top players to watch for in the postseason Ted Plessl is your man.

The former Palmerton High baseball coach has been out watching scholastic games since the first allowed playing date on March 25.

Plessl goes to the games because he loves baseball and because he wants to see the talented kids who may want to play for the Lehigh Valley Carpenter Cup team.

Each year Plessl serves as field manager and he joins forces with general manager and founder Joe Pirro in assembling a competitive roster that has won the tournament sponsored by the Phillies three times (1998 2001 and 2011) and has reached the semifinals five times including last June when the locals lost a 6-5 heartbreaker to Mercer County.

Tryouts will begin at 8:15 a.m. on May 15 at Limeport Stadium.

Other tryouts are planned for 8:30 a.m. on May 22 and 29 also at Limeport with the team set to be finalized on June 7. All tryouts will be held rain or shine.

“We’re asking for some cooperation from our high school coaches to distribute the Lehigh Valley Cup information they received about a week ago and to try to alter any Sunday practices to the late morning or early afternoons on those dates” Plessl said. “Besides the paperwork profile waiver and fee we’re also asking all players to bring their own helmets and bats and for catchers to bring their gear.”

Plessl said that in addition to Pirro and himself the staff features Joe Candelmo Jeremy Gigliotti Tom Plessl Ken Serfass and Cody Weiss.

“The staff and I have been to 30 high school games and have seen directly or indirectly every team in the Lehigh Valley area” Plessl said. “We have found a lot of really good players and are looking forward to the first tryout.”

By Carpenter Cup rules the roster will consist of 25 players — 18 position players a designated hitter and seven pitchers.

In addition to guys who will be back at the high school level in 2023 each team will be allowed to roster 15 seniors.

The opportunity to play at Citizens Bank Park is always an enticement for the players.

A team must win its first two games set for Richie Ashburn Field at FDR Park and reach the semis to get to play at the home of the Phillies.

“I look at the Carpenter Cup as one of the best amateur baseball tournaments around” Plessl said. “There are nearly 100 college and MLB scouts that attend these games and the skills day is a scouting combine for 64 underclassmen. Over the years Joe Pirro and I have often received phone calls in the dugout about players the scouts have noticed.”

Plessl proudly notes that the Lehigh Valley entry has had numerous alumni go on to sign professional contracts and three players — Northampton’s Brian Schneider Catasauqua’s Anthony Recker and Liberty’s Matt McBride — have played in the big leagues. All three were catchers and Mike Piazza another catcher recently became the first Carpenter Cup alum to be inducted into the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.

Plessl noted that in 2008 Lehigh Valley played against future MLB stars Mike Trout and Joey Wendle.

“Last year we faced eight pitchers who at the time were Division I prospects and we were being talked about as players who would be drafted” Plessl said. “Two of the pitchers were drafted in the first round and signed.”

Pirro said it’s a great opportunity for local players to experience the best of what’s out there.

“What’s always significant is stressing what makes Carpenter Cup what it is — the opposing talent and the opportunity to play on a team [Lehigh Valley] that has more talent than any other team any of our individuals will have played on and against better individuals and teams [than] they will have ever faced” Pirro said. “It is the best talent you can gather up in the tri-state — bar none. It is every year and has always been.

“What kids need to understand is the difference in the level of play and in the speed of the game in helping to both show them the difference and also help them to determine their own readiness to play at the next level” Pirro said. “Even Carpenter Cup tryouts may represent the first time an individual has had to compete for a spot.”

Pirro added the importance of the players staying committed.

“What we need is a full sustained commitment once players have made the team not just for a game or two or an appearance at Citizens Bank Park but throughout the entire tournament” he said. “You have to finish what you start. We can’t have players play the first game then disappear to another state for another showcase when we’ve moved on to the quarterfinals. That hurts everyone and then we aren’t the team we selected.”

With that in mind a mandatory practice is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. on June 12. The skills day with select players receiving an invitation is on June 13 and Lehigh Valley opens the tournament at 4 p.m. June 14 against Burlington. The quarterfinals are slated for June 17 the semis on June 19 and the championship game on June 20.

Tigers on the prowl

After a 1-4 start defending Colonial League champ Northwestern Lehigh has been on a roll as the regular season heads toward the finish line. A 12-inning win over Southern Lehigh on Thursday night was the Tigers’ seventh in a row a streak that started after a 10-6 loss to Saucon Valley on April 22.

“It has just been the growth factor” said first-year coach Chad Cooperman. “At any given time we start two freshmen and five sophomores. Them just getting used to the pace of varsity baseball and having guys step up with big performances has been the difference. The biggest factor is that we’ve started to play team baseball. That’s been the turning point after the Saucon Valley loss because we had been playing selfish baseball to that point. Since then the guys have flipped the switch.”

Cooperman said he has also developed a tighter bond with the players as the season has progressed.

“We’ve had a good relationship from the beginning and now they’re finally starting to see the results” the former Salisbury High and Bloomsburg University standout said. “The trust level has magnified tremendously. But the kids have really been great. They show up every day and work hard at practice and they bring the energy on game days. They’re playing really good team baseball and as a coach that’s your dream.”

As for the upcoming six-team tournament set to begin with a pair of games on May 13 Cooperman said it’s wide open.

“It’s going to be the most competitive tournament the Colonial League has seen in a while” he said. “It’s going to be very interesting to see how the final standings turn out and how the matchups align. You have two teams with two league losses and two teams with three losses with others right behind. It’s really tight.”

Northwestern Lehigh senior Ben Boyer has played a big role in the Tigers’ 7-game winning streak.

Player of the Week

BEN BOYER NORTHWESTERN LEHIGH

While Cooperman has emphasized it has been a team effort for the Tigers during their winning streak several individuals have been instrumental in the team’s rise. One of them is Ben Boyer a senior.

“He has been a tremendous leader for us” Cooperman said. “He’s had great success on the mound and at the dish and has done a really good job of late of pulling up the younger guys and getting them to play at a really high level which has been awesome to watch as a coach.”

Boyer is hitting .450 with nine doubles and hasn’t struck out.

“He hits well in the clutch and has a lot of success when we need him to and has been a staple in our lineup all year” Cooperman said. “He’s also our main guy on the mound. He’s got 51.2 innings and an ERA of 1.35 with 53 strikeouts. He’s 7-1 and he takes the ball every fifth day and when he does we have a lot of confidence he’s going to pitch deep into the game and have success. He has been monumental for us.”

On a 2-1 swing in the eighth inning Belt came up empty and grimacing appearing to gesture at his neck. Manager Gabe Kapler and head athletic trainer Dave Groeschner immediately came out of the dugout to check on him and after a brief discussion at home plate walked him back to the dugout. LaMonte Wade Jr. finished the at-bat by drawing a walk.

After the game Kapler said Belt was dealing with stiffness in his neck and was considered day-to-day.

“It was a little stiff earlier in the game and he felt it on the swing so we got him out of there” Kapler said. “We’ll just wait until he comes in tomorrow and we’ll see.”

A long layoff can increase any kind of injury risk and Belt was playing his first game since last Wednesday a span of 10 days.

Belt was activated from the COVID IL prior to first pitch though he wasn’t made available to the media before the game and left the clubhouse afterward without addressing reporters.

Before the game Kapler declined to explain the work Belt had been able to do while in quarantine to remain in game condition.

“I’m not going to get into specifics” Kapler said.

In four trips to the plate prior exiting the game Belt had walked three times and grounded out to first.

He had been 5-for-16 at the plate prior to testing positive for COVID last week.

The COVID infection was the second time Belt has dealt with the virus after first contracting it January 2021.",,,

ICE is a Fortune 500 company that offers financial technology data and market infrastructure services. It operates exchanges like the NYSE and clearing houses to help people invest raise capital and manage risk across asset classes.

ICE created its first nature-based futures contract called NBS future. It trades under the contract code NBT which delivers verified carbon unit (VCU) credits.

ICE NBT futures have several certifications. These include Verra VCS Agriculture and Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) Projects. It also has certifications from the Climate Community and Biodiversity (CCB) Standard.

ICE Nature-Based Solutions Futures Contract

An entity can produce NBS carbon credits through various schemes like planting trees or protecting forests.

Each ICE NBS futures contract equals 1000 carbon credits. And each credit equals one metric ton of emissions removed or reduced by projects that preserve natural ecosystems.

It has vintages covering January 1 2016 to December 31 2020.

ICE has listed NBS futures expiries in December 2022 December 2023 and December 2024.

They traded at $11.25 per tonne by 1109 GMT according to data from the ICE website.

As per Gordon Bennett Managing Director of Utility Markets at ICE

“The NBS future is our first contract specifically designed to measure the carbon sequestration and storage capabilities of nature… we hope it to be an important valuation tool to conserve and grow the world’s natural capital base.”

The decision to launch this contract will help bring price signals to the carbon market. The firm also believes that it will incentivize efficient capital allocation to balance the world’s carbon budget and hit net zero goals.

ICE has worked with environmental markets for about 20 years now. Over this period it has traded over 100 billion tons of carbon allowances and over 250 million renewable energy certificates.

Moreover ICE traded about 3 billion carbon credits which is equal to over 1.4 billion Renewable Identification Numbers.

In 2021 alone ICE traded around $1 trillion in the notional value of carbon allowances. This is equal to more than half the estimated global annual energy-related emissions.

ICE Futures Contract Supporters

A lot of large companies are supporting the futures contract. These are Shell Chevron Vitol Trafigura EDF Trading Elbow River Marketing Ltd. (a fully owned Parkland Fuel subsidiary) the Macquarie Group and Vertree Partners.

For instance according to Bill McGrath from Shell

“The launch of ICE NBS futures is a crucial milestone to scale the voluntary carbon market… In particular it will help boost the flow of capital for developing nature-based projects.”

Last year Shell partnered with PetroChina to supply it with carbon-neutral LNG cargos. Their goal is to offset CO2 emissions generated across the LNG value chain with carbon credits from nature-based projects.

For Vitol quality assurance and transparency of carbon credits are also vital. Michael Curran from Vitol said that the launch will grow investment in verified carbon mitigating projects. Plus it will raise standards and price transparency across the carbon credit industry.

Whereas Hannah Hauman from Trafigura finds the launch of ICE nature-based solutions futures a crucial development in global carbon markets. And that it will help deliver transparency and liquidity for quality nature-based solutions.

Likewise Elbow River Marketing thinks that it will also bring liquidity to the booming voluntary carbon market.

In August last year CME Group launched its CBL Nature-based Global Emissions Offset (N-GEO) futures contract. It’s also one of the top nature-based solutions (NBS) contracts available in the market.

CME’s CBL N-GEO contracts consist of offsets from agriculture forestry and other land-use projects. They’re verified to have additional climate community and biodiversity accreditation.

CBL N-GEO futures contract has the same rigorous certifications as ICE NBS futures. They are also both created to help create a more transparent and efficient voluntary carbon market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzQwZTUxNjIwLTNkYTYtNGJjNi05ZDQzLTA1MjM2YzdkYWE5M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cloud computing powers the world's financial exchanges,"Print this page

Simply sign up to the Technology sector myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.

Many of the world’s largest financial exchanges are transforming the way they run global capital markets through the adoption of cloud computing technologies.

In November financial derivatives exchange CME Group entered a 10-year partnership with Google that will move CME’s IT infrastructure and markets to the cloud. CME says this will enable it to launch new products and services much more quickly.

A few weeks later Nasdaq and Amazon Web Services announced a similar collaboration. Through a several-year partnership AWS will work with Nasdaq to transfer the latter’s North America-based markets to a cloud computing environment.

Traditional institutions such as financial exchanges are drawn to cloud infrastructure because they want to “increase market access” and “streamline operations” according to Adrian Poole head of financial services at Google Cloud UK.

He explains that they can achieve these goals due to the flexible and scalable nature of cloud technology which enables organisations to scale capacity up or down at any time.

But Poole adds that cloud adoption isn’t just a case of improving infrastructure. He points out that multinational companies like CME Group are using the greater processing power of cloud computing to “meet customer expectations in new ways” and “drive transformation”.

“The vast amount of computing power that the cloud offers means that data analysis can happen at lightning speed” he explains. “This means that when it comes to firms wanting to do things like risk management it can be done in real time — adjusting by the minute to factors such as legal liability and financial uncertainty.

“Organisations can use these capabilities to their advantage — for example using this data analysis to create automated tools that can help mitigate risk.”

Cloud computing also provides a range of security and privacy benefits for financial institutions that hold vast amounts of sensitive data — and have become prime targets for cybercriminals.

Poole says cloud providers are able to meet the need for continuous risk monitoring and regulatory compliance by adopting practices such zero-trust models. These ensure that all user identities — in or out of a network — are verified.

In addition customer data are protected by the engineering principle of ‘redundant design’ where critical system components are duplicated to provide back-up and increased reliability.

Spectrum Markets a pan-European trading venue for securitised derivatives uses cloud computing for storing and analysing data. The company’s chief executive Nicky Maan says the most significant benefit of cloud systems is how they allow digital infrastructure to be used for accelerating business growth.

“It is really easy to extend the cloud resources you use as and when required because the storage and processing of data are not dependent on traditional in-house hardware capabilities. You can simply rent the additional capacity you need.

“This can even run automatically where your system detects it needs more capacity and immediately acquires additional resources” Maan notes. “So if the number of financial products listed on your venue grows from say 2500 to 100000 you don’t need to install new systems to store all the data or scale up your analysis capacity to handle the additional volume of information.”

Financial institutions outsourcing their technical infrastructure to a cloud provider like Amazon Google or Microsoft however must ensure systems comply with industry regulations such as those set by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority and the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

“That includes having full control on latency — or the speed of information transmission required for accurately pricing financial products — as well as the ability to transfer any outsourced part of your infrastructure to another provider in the event something goes wrong” Maan explains.

“Saying ‘my supplier went down’ isn’t a valid excuse to the regulator” he emphasises. “So you need to be able to switch your supplier to another one if they continually let you down.”

But because switching between two cloud platforms is an arduous task he recommends that financial exchanges keep “complex integrated and time-sensitive systems” on hardware-based infrastructure instead.

An example of such a system is the matching engine of a digital exchange — “the heart of any marketplace as it determines the prices at which buyers and sellers transact”.

A single cloud provider may not be enough to manage all risks though suggests Conor Colleary group vice-president of financial services at US computing giant Oracle.

He warns: “With service availability and security being the main priorities stock exchanges need to be aware that the stakes of a service interruption at a single cloud service provider are higher as organisations need to make sure they are using the best cloud for each particular function or workload.” This is to avoid “putting all your eggs in one basket”.

Colleary says firms can avoid system outages cyber security breaches and internet traffic problems by adopting a multi-cloud approach — whereby they use a variety of cloud services from several providers instead of just one. This means stock exchanges can “play to the different strengths of different clouds” and “have a Plan B if their cloud service goes down”.

“Resilience and trust are crucial as capital markets companies rely on their customers being confident in their ability to stay online 24/7 in order to deliver data to customers as fast as technically possible” Colleary adds.

Furthermore cloud technology enables a move away from outdated networking equipment and servers which are often expensive and time-consuming to maintain.

Chris Weston principal of client advisory at analyst firm IDC believes emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing will transform cloud capabilities in the foreseeable future.

For example he envisages that businesses making lots of transactions and storing large volumes of data will be able to use quantum computing platforms to perform “calculations that until now have been impossible or way too lengthy with traditional computers”.

Meanwhile powerful AI tools will let securities exchanges perform “real-time analysis of trading to highlight and mitigate compliance and conduct issues as they arise”.

Weston says he has no doubt that AI and quantum computing “will form part of the technology road maps of these organisations over the next five to 10 years”.",,,,,,

Difficult but possible,"

The recently released report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC ) in February 2022 has made it clear that the future lies in climate resilient development or nothing. Following on the heels of COP26 it has suggested serious and urgent attention to adaptation of climate risk management and mitigation policies so that the goal of 1.5 degree temperature is met. One might think this means substantial investment in renewable energy  clean technology infrastructure and linked sectors perhaps at the expense of others and sacrificing competitiveness.Given the abundance of traditional energy sources like coal and their dependence on linked industries some of our states like UP MP and Odisha may not be naturally competitive in these areas. They may lose out in this race of attracting investment. This may exacerbate inequalities unemployment and poverty while simultaneously compromising their revenue generating capacity and competitiveness. Moreover employment generation due to this shift might also be concentrated in the more developed states of India resulting in regional disparities and also livelihood losses. Thus the question is can competitiveness and our jobs agenda and climate resilient investment go hand in hand?The IPCC report also cautions about risks of mal-adaptations in design and implementation of policies. This can have adverse consequences for the society particularly for the vulnerable groups. It suggests some enabling conditions to ensure optimal design and implementation of such policies. In a recently released White Paper on Improving India’s Competitiveness for Inclusive Economic Growth jointly curated by CUTS International Institute for Competitiveness and Institute for Studies in Industrial Development we review the enabling conditions for improving and sustaining India’s competitiveness and found substantial similarity with the conditions mentioned in the IPCC report. These are:Competitiveness for inclusive growth is underlined by strengthening of social and economic infrastructures in education and health. The IPCC report also highlights that the feasibility and effectiveness of climate mitigation policies is dependent not just on physical infrastructure development but also on social infrastructure. This would enhance the adaptive capacity of the vulnerable groups through their livelihood diversification and employment as well as access to basic services and infrastructure. Thus investment in health and education will be critical for building competitiveness and human capital as well as climate resilient development.For competitiveness it is essential to ensure convergence among different policies and actors both within and outside government and at various levels. As per the IPCC report if policies focus on sectors in isolation it would lead to mal-adaptation. It emphasises on multi-sectoral multi-actor approach and inclusive planning to minimise adaptation failures. This means that public sector firms private players trade unions as well as civil society organisations all must participate in policy designing as it would ensure that all interests of stakeholders especially the vulnerable like local and poorer communities are taken into account.Building institutional ability strength and credibility is the backbone for competitiveness of an economy. The IPCC report also acknowledges that effective adaptation may be constrained by institutional and technological capacity. It notes that effective implementation of adaptations through financial and technological resources is possible only when supported by institutions with capacity to understand the requirements.This principle is at the core of all the factors. Notably the IPCC report in multiple instances highlights the importance of coordinated action at all governance levels. Our White Paper on competitiveness also lays sufficient emphasis on coordination among three levels of governance and between departments. This is especially relevant in a country like India with existing inertia and economic disparity which adversely impacts competitiveness.India is already on a clear policy pathway towards climate resilient development as evidenced by its ambitious commitments at COP26. This would require infrastructure development for which the government is promoting foreign and domestic investments through schemes such as Production Linked Incentives. The private sector is also making sufficient strides by investing heavily in renewable energy electric mobility and non-fossil fuel sources towards its own decarbonisation goals. These investments will propel India’s competitive growth generate employment and contribute to climate change mitigation.However such transition for climate change adaptations need to happen in a just fair and equitable manner taking into account existing competencies and competitiveness of different regions. Investments must serve both developmental and adaptation objectives. Only when climate resilient development occurs with inclusive growth and equity and justice are prioritised can it lead to sustainable outcomes.India must seek to achieve the dual objectives of economic growth and achieving its own climate goals  through carefully curated and implemented policies for attracting public and private sector investments. Given the extreme inequalities in India the policies for achieving these objectives must prioritise sustainability (for future generations) inclusivity (for vulnerable groups) and equity (to reduce economic disparity). This can only happen when the fundamental building blocks of a competitive climate resilient economy as discussed above are in place. The future of India as a competitive economy contributing to global climate change goals with equitable domestic growth lies in this integration.The authors work for CUTS International a global public policy research and advocacy group.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL3dvcmxkLW5ld3MvZGVsYXktaW4tY3BlYy1wcm9qZWN0cy1zb3dpbmctZnJ1c3RyYXRpb24taW4tcGFraXN0YW4tY2hpbmEtcmVwb3J0L2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkxNDAyNjk4LmNtc9IBmQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL3dvcmxkLW5ld3MvZGVsYXktaW4tY3BlYy1wcm9qZWN0cy1zb3dpbmctZnJ1c3RyYXRpb24taW4tcGFraXN0YW4tY2hpbmEtcmVwb3J0L2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MTQwMjY5OC5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delay in CPEC projects sowing frustration in Pakistan China: Report,"

Amid long delays in the completion of projects and building up arrears the once much celebrated China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) from China's Xinjiang province running up to Gwadar in Balochistan is increasingly becoming dysfunctional leading to increasing frustration in both the countries a media report said.The big projects under the project are having problems raising the required funds and the completed projects are being shut down a media portal reported adding that the government of Pakistan has now also abolished the CPEC authority which was set up for smooth and rapid development.Beijing is reluctant to release the pledged funds for infrastructure projects. Meanwhile Chinese companies have also stopped generating electricity in CPEC projects demanding payment of arrears. High-interest rates on CPEC loans rising project costs weak projects and attacks on CPEC infrastructure are major issues in what has become a white elephant dream.The CPEC was launched as part of the bigger Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) introduced by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013 drawing worldwide attention.But things did not go as planned and as Pakistan's economic situation deteriorated the country was pushed into debt. Seeing that many of the USD 62 billion CPEC mega projects have not even started after all these years.This has led to growing frustration in Pakistan with the Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal recently expressing dissatisfaction over the slow progress of important projects.Many Pakistani politicians and experts were concerned about its potential as the CPEC projects and its tough loan terms were a matter of concern since the beginning the report said.Pakistan has also been considering abandoning the CPEC altogether if the US provides similar financial assistance.The energy crisis has given Islamabad a strong reason to cut the size of the CPEC as Chinese companies have decided to cut off power generation. The shortage was more than 6000 MW when 15500 MW of energy was produced the report said.Chinese companies have decided to cut power generation by 1980 MW. Due to the non-payment of PKR 300 billion the installed capacity has increased by only 37 percent and a new wave of power crisis has emerged in Pakistan.Islamabad's response to the removal of the CPEC has given a clear signal that it does not want China's influence in Pakistan to continue the report said adding that Pakistan has spent a large portion of its revenue on repaying loans for the CPEC project. However many CPEC projects have been delayed or failed.China has stopped paying for the final stages of major projects putting even more pressure on Pakistan and a new wave of energy crisis has gripped Pakistan as Chinese companies will not generate electricity until their payments are made the report said.Thus there is no doubt that CPEC would be a huge responsibility and a source of huge costs for Pakistan if Pakistan delays in paying Chinese companies the report further said adding that Pakistan's current account deficit has already reached USD13.2 billion and is expected to be 5-6 percent of the country's GDP in the first nine months of the current fiscal year.Every average Pakistani believed that CPEC would bring development and prosperity the report said adding that however the rift between Islamabad and Beijing in the CPEC is widening every day.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L29pbC1nYXMvZG9tZXN0aWMtbHBnLWN5bGluZGVyLXByaWNlLWhpa2VkLWJ5LXJzLTUwLW5vdy1qdXN0LTUwLXBhaXNlLXNob3J0LW9mLXJzLTEwMDAtbWFyay9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85MTM5MDUwNy5jbXPSAaMBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5L2VuZXJneS9vaWwtZ2FzL2RvbWVzdGljLWxwZy1jeWxpbmRlci1wcmljZS1oaWtlZC1ieS1ycy01MC1ub3ctanVzdC01MC1wYWlzZS1zaG9ydC1vZi1ycy0xMDAwLW1hcmsvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkxMzkwNTA3LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Domestic LPG cylinder price hiked by Rs 50 now just 50 paise short of Rs 1000 mark,"

Date 08.05.2022 Read time 3 Min Ahead of the inaugural Miami Grand Prix Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant Formula One™ Team driver Sebastian Vettel swapped the cockpit for the classroom to inspire local school children at Carol City Middle School.

Together with Cognizant as part of the Make a Mark arm of our I / AM programme Seb led an assembly for 500 students where he talked about career opportunities in motorsport within the fields of science technology engineering and mathematics (STEM).

Our visit to Carol City Middle School is set to have a lasting positive impact that goes beyond the Miami Grand Prix as Cognizant will provide students at the school with additional online STEM learning. The extra resource is tailored to complement the students' existing curriculum encouraging them to pursue careers in motorsport.

""I knew what I wanted from a very young age and I did all that I could to go after it"" said Sebastian. ""Life can turn out in so many different ways but ultimately it’s about finding that passion believing in yourself and going after it.""

#IAMMIAMI Inspiring future generations Together with Cognizant as part of our Make A Mark programme our team and Sebastian Vettel met with local school children in Miami to discuss experiences of an F1 driver STEM subjects and future career opportunities in motorsport.

Tanjim Hossain a teacher at Carol City Middle School added ""We're really excited that Aston Martin Formula One Team and their title partner Cognizant are here to help our children learn about all the different opportunities available through motorsport and STEM.""

While 7th grade student Za’niyah Rhim said  ""Today was super fun meeting him [Sebastian Vettel]. It was a big opportunity and it inspired me to follow my dreams no matter what.""

Janet Woods from Cognizant Outreach shared: ""It's been a remarkable day at Carol City Middle School in Miami. Working alongside Aston Martin F1 we watched the students' minds open up while they listened to Sebastian. At Cognizant we're committed to creating equal opportunity and diversity both in and out of the workplace. It's our hope that our partnership with Aston Martin F1 will continue to inspire future generations.""

You. Us. Together. Our mantra. Our pledge. Everywhere we go we make a mark that leaves a legacy: broadening horizons; breaking down barriers; driving diversity and equality of opportunity. Thank you to Carol City Middle School for your warm welcome we hope to have inspired the pupils that we met – the next generation – to study STEM subjects and helped fuel their passionate pursuit of a career in motorsport. #IAMMIAMI.

Mindtree became one of the movers and shakers of the stock market in the last three years -- its stock price rose 377% to Rs 3374 apiece as of Friday’s close from Rs 700 apiece when he took charge.Before he became Mindtree’s CEO Chatterjee spent 23 years in Nasdaq-listed Cognizant including his last stint as the president of global delivery where he led the digital systems and technology practice its largest service line that accounted for nearly 70% of its revenue back then.Popularly called DC he was employee no.1 at Cognizant’s development centre in Kolkata that was incubated at his home office there. In fact a candid conversation among senior leaders in Cognizant was that DC hired his first boss -- Siddhartha Mukherjee who was previously the head of the Kolkata development centre. Later DC became the head of Cognizant's Pune and Kolkata centres that grew to over 25000 and 20000 employees respectively.He was instrumental in growing Cognizant’s banking and financial services (BFS) practice. Chatterjee led BFS as SVP and global head until 2007. Under his watch some of the key BFS accounts including JPMorgan AmEx and Credit Suisse grew in size sources told TOI. DC is also credited with growing Cognizant’s infrastructure services practice to $1 billion.Ramkumar Ramamoorthy  former Cognizant India CMD and partner at Catalincs “DC has the unique distinction of building as well as running large businesses across industries service lines and geographies. I can think of only a bunch of people in the IT services industry globally who have run $8 billion or more businesses that too very successfully.”Ramamoorthy said DC is both a rainmaker and a pied piper. “Although based out of India DC built strong networks and deep relationships with client CXOs across the globe and helped grow many strategic accounts to over a hundred million dollars in revenue annually.

A 2020 analysis by the Health Policy Institute confirms Mahmoud’s observation finding that the racial and ethnic composition of the U.S. dental workforce doesn’t reflect that of the U.S. population. According to the study the U.S. dental workforce is over 70 percent white and 18 percent Asian with all other groups of color making up less than 12 percent—even though these groups compose more than a third of the U.S. population. Increasing diversity in dentistry can lead to more equitable and higher-quality oral health care for communities of color whose limited access to dental care contributes to higher rates of periodontal disease diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

Mahmoud is the inaugural recipient of the Freeman Grant Franklin Scholarship at HSDM established to support predoctoral students from underrepresented backgrounds. Activated with a capstone gift from the Colgate-Palmolive Company the scholarship pays tribute to prominent figures in HSDM’s history: Robert Tanner Freeman DMD 1869 the first African American in the country to graduate from a dental school; George Grant DMD 1884 Harvard’s first African American faculty member; and Dolores Mercedes Franklin DMD ’74 PD ’76 the first African American woman to graduate from HSDM.

HODA MAHMOUD DMD ’25 THE INAUGURAL RECIPIENT OF THE FREEMAN GRANT FRANKLIN SCHOLARSHIP AT HSDM

The scholarship which will be awarded annually is also funded by gifts from HSDM alumni and community members who are dedicated to expanding diversity in dentistry. These include scholarship namesake Dolores Mercedes Franklin who went on to achieve many other firsts such as becoming the first woman and the first person of color to hold the top-ranking dentist executive position in a Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company. Through her trailblazing career and her financial support Franklin is helping to pave the way for future dentists to increase equity in oral health care for all Americans.

“Our students are entering a profession when there still exists an underserved population—a dire separation of those who have oral health needs and those who have access to care” Franklin says. “This scholarship holds the promise of attracting highly qualified students with financial need and preparing them to be global leaders in their fields dedicated to improving human health and in doing so addressing health disparities.”

Throughout her career Franklin has advocated for oral health as integral to systemic health including through her work leading Oral Health Programs and Policy as assistant health commissioner for New York City with a dual reporting line to the NYC Health and Hospitals Corporation the nation’s largest public health care system.

“The Harvard School of Dental Medicine has a long legacy of embracing diversity. Our donors’ generous support will help further our ethos to promote greater diversity inclusion and belonging in dental education and in oral health research.”

— HSDM DEAN WILLIAM GIANNOBILE DMSC ’96 PD ’96

Much like Franklin Mahmoud is focused on oral health as fundamental to overall well-being. As she embarks on her academic journey at HSDM she hopes to become involved in public health research with the goal of minimizing the negative effects that socioeconomic status can have on patient care. She’s also interested in exploring the connections between mental health systemic health and oral health.

“As the daughter of immigrants I have witnessed the difference in care and empathy between providers that are well-rounded in their experiences with diverse cultures and those that have limited encounters with their patient pool” Mahmoud says. “Empathy comes with experience and it is an essential trait that is needed in the health care field. This scholarship has increased my interest in providing better care for minority groups. With this scholarship I hope to be a part of the solution.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcHBpLmNvbS9jb250ZW50cy92aWV3X2JyZWFraW5nLW5ld3MvMjAyMi0wNy0wNS9wY2Etc2tpbi1pbnRyb2R1Y2VzLW5ldy1waWdtZW50LWdlbC1wcm8tZGFyay1zcG90LXRyZWF0bWVudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PCA Skin Introduces New Pigment Gel Pro Dark Spot Treatment,"Breaking News

By early next year they could have increased choices for high-speed internet services including up to three fiber-optic providers.

Underline Infrastructure MetroNet and Colorado Springs Utilities all have announced plans since October to build fiber-optic networks across the city that will provide internet (both upload and download) speeds of up to 10 gigabits-per-second or about 10 times the top speed now available from the area's two current providers.

At the same time those providers Comcast and Lumen Technologies' CenturyLink unit also are expanding and upgrading their local networks to provide ""multi-gigabit"" download and upload speeds.

""It is a gold rush — if one gas station builds on a corner a competitor wants to build across the street on another corner. The competitive threat is a big motivator"" for fiber operators said Gary Bolton CEO of the Fiber Broadband Association which represents more than 400 fiber network operators vendors and suppliers. ""Broadband (high-speed internet service) is critical to everyone.""

While other cities have multiple providers offering internet access networks that use fiber extensively Colorado Springs would be the nation's first metro area with three competing fiber networks under construction at the same time along with two existing broadband networks.

But a wealth of choices won't necessarily guarantee success for fiber-optic providers. In fact it could lead to financial disaster for one or more of them industry analysts say.

Jonathan Chaplin who heads the U.S. communications industry team for London-based New Street Research said two providers offering 1 gigabit or more per second internet speeds can operate profitably.

""Two providers makes a good market"" Chaplin said. ""If there is a third provider no one will make money.

""Each network has a substantial cost to build and operate"" he said. ""It sounds fantastic for consumers — both households and businesses will benefit in the short term. But it could be very bad in the long term if no one makes money. They will either go out of business or service will suffer. It is insanity.""

Ray Gifford managing partner in the Denver office of law firm Wilkinson Bauer Knauer and former chairman of the Colorado Public Utilities Commission said that two broadband providers in a market ""is a party three is a crowd and four or five is unbelievable.""

A five-way competition he added will lead to ""cutthroat competition and eventually to failure of multiple networks.""

Comcast and Lumen can upgrade their networks to speeds rivaling fiber networks at a fraction of the cost of building a new network Gifford said. That means they will have networks offering similar speeds to the fiber networks at much less cost giving them a major competitive advantage.

Gifford added that telecommunications giants AT&T and Verizon both tried to build fiber networks in several cities with limited success — later halting those plans amid mounting losses.

Elliot Noss CEO of Ting Internet and its Canadian parent company Tucows isn't convinced all three networks will be built. Ting signed a 25-year lease in January valued at $593 million to become the ""anchor"" tenant on the Colorado Springs Utilities fiber network.

""I am not aware of any other city with three (competing) fiber networks"" Noss said. ""But let's see — a lot of things have been announced all over the country. When I see houses in Colorado Springs that can order services from all three networks I'll believe it. If and when that happens you will see more competition better pricing and sharper (more reliable and faster) service from all three. If that is the case the whole country will be watching.""

Noss doesn't know whether Colorado Springs can support all three networks as well as existing providers Comcast Lumen and others who serve parts of the city and surrounding area.

The battle for customers he said won't be waged citywide but block-by-block and neighborhood-by-neighborhood with providers likely targeting different parts of the city when they begin construction.

Underline CEO Bob Thompson said he isn't worried about other providers building competing networks in Colorado Springs.

""None of this (plans for other networks) changes the excitement we have about what is going on in this city although it is always good to be first (into a market)"" he said. ""All of this just confirms what we have been saying about this market all along. There is room (in the market) for more than one of us.""

Kris Smith a Monument resident and MetroNet's government affairs director said the company welcomes competition and often vies with two other broadband providers for customers. MetroNet's network also will be completed four years before the Colorado Springs Utilities network is finished she said.

""Anytime you increase competition you bring better prices and service. That is what we want to bring to Colorado Springs"" Smith said. ""We are building our network in two years versus six for Utilities.""

Ben Kley president of StratusIQ which provides fiber-optic service in parts of Colorado Springs and El Paso County and will offer service on Underline's network said local demand for broadband service is strong.

""No one buys more than one internet"" connection he said. ""We feel we have been successful in our niche market for some time (providing local fiber-optic service since 2007). It costs a lot of money and it is very difficult to build reach and serve customers on a fiber network. It will be very interesting to see how everyone else (competitors) executes"" their plans in Colorado Springs.

Fiber-based networks are available to about 40% of the nation's households with that percentage expected to nearly double during the next five years according to the fiber trade group.

Some of the growth in fiber coverage will come from a record $65 billion in federal spending to improve internet speeds in rural and other areas without service that provides at least 25 megabits per second download speeds and 3 megabits per second upload speeds.

Fiber providers are unveiling plans to build networks in cities across the nation fueled by demand for faster internet access and a flood of investment in such networks by private equity firms venture capital funds and others seeking to cash in on that demand said Noss the Tucows and Ting Internet CEO.

Those investors see much of the U.S. as ripe for such investment since fiber networks already serve major industrialized parts of Asia Europe and Canada he said.

Fiber providers began looking to expand to Colorado Springs during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when internet usage surged and existing networks were strained by many residents suddenly working learning shopping and getting entertained from home through their internet connection.

Underline and Colorado Springs Utilities began making plans at that time to build citywide fiber networks — with far different goals in mind.

Underline began construction of its $100 million network in October and formed partnerships with four internet service providers including StratusIQ to sell access to that network to consumers and businesses. Stratus formerly known as Falcon Broadband also operates is a separate network with 4000 customers in northeast Colorado Springs and areas north and east of the city.

Underline a startup funded by America Online founder Steve Case and Laurene Powell Jobs widow of Apple founder Steve Jobs also is building a $35 million network in Fountain for consumers and its city-owned utility.

The company hopes to connect the first customers in or near downtown to its network next month and finish the first phase of construction in central Colorado Springs by late this year with two more phases of construction planned in 2023 and 2024.

Company spokeswoman Eva Arevou said Underline hopes 40% of the 28000 homes and businesses in neighborhoods served by the initial phase of its network will sign up for its service.

""This market is underserved for internet access. In this country access to the internet needs to be fast affordable and fair. None of those three exist today in Colorado Springs"" said Thompson the Underline CEO.

Utilities is building a 2000-mile network over six years that will pass every home the city-owned enterprise serves to better control its electric natural gas water and wastewater systems.

The network will include excess capacity that Utilities will lease to Ting and possibly other providers — Google Fiber said in March it wants to also lease space from Utilities but hasn't yet reached an agreement — who will offer internet access to residential and business customers. Construction is expected to begin this summer on the Utilities network.

MetroNet began discussions with city officials last summer and announced plans March 31 to spend $130 million building a citywide fiber network during the next 2 to 2½ years.

The company funded by private equity giant KKR will operate the network and sell internet access directly to customers unlike Underline and Utilities. MetroNet plans on starting construction on the network in early summer and connect its first customers early next year.

""Colorado Springs is an underserved market and we are bringing a new and better choice with fiber"" said Smith the MetroNet executive.

""Fiber gives you a dedicated connection"" she said. ""Five years ago most people had one or two devices connected to the internet. Now we have 20-plus so the issue is not only speed but bandwidth and reliability. With all the connected devices you experience a degradation in service. That is the key piece Colorado Springs is missing.""

Fiber networks won't be limited to just Colorado Springs or Fountain residents.

Mountain View Electric Association plans to spend $190 million during the next five years to extend fiber-optic internet service capability to all 51000 members in its eight-county service area which includes parts of El Paso County. The Limon-based rural electric cooperative is working with Kansas City Mo-based Conexon to build the 5800-mile network.

Both Comcast and Lumen are investing heavily to upgrade their networks in Colorado Springs along the Front Range and in other parts of Colorado.

Comcast has spent $1.3 billion since 2019 to upgrade its network across the state which serves 2.2 million customers including 254000 in Colorado Springs that have access to download speeds of more than 1 gigabit per second. Much of that funding has been spent installing fiber-optic lines to neighborhood connection boxes or nodes that are then connected to individual homes with traditional coaxial cable.

""We have had fiber in our Colorado Springs network for 10 years and we continue to push fiber closer to the customer"" said Bryan Thomas Comcast's vice president of engineering for its Mountain West region.

The company is in the early stages of upgrading its Colorado network to the newest cable internet technology that will deliver download speeds of 10 gigabits per second which is available in some areas in or near downtown Colorado Springs and Denver.

Lumen spokesman Mark Molzen said the Louisiana-based company is making ""significant investments in our network to bring broadband access to every coroner of our service territory where it is economically feasible.""

He said Lumen provides its fastest internet access — nearly 1 gigabit per second — to nearly 40000 Colorado Springs customers with expansion planned to more than 10000 more by year's end. The company also plans to launch ""multi-gigabit per second"" internet service in Colorado Springs later this year.

Cell phone giant T-Mobile also offers home internet service through its wireless network to about 25% of the Colorado Springs though that service offers speeds of 35-115 megabits per second. Verizon offers a similar service offering much faster speeds in Denver and 67 other cities but its 5G Home service is not yet available in Colorado Springs according to the company's news releases.

A company spokeswoman said Verizon is ""rapidly expanding"" the service but declined to say when it would be available locally.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwcC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA1LzA3L3RpbnRvbi1mYWxscy1uai1tdXJkZXItd29tYW4tZ2V0cy1saWZlLXByaXNvbi1sb3Zlci1kZWF0aC85NjQ2MjkxMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,She tried to kill her lover twice. Now Tinton Falls woman gets life in prison for murder,"FREEHOLD - When Tyrita Julius rebuffed lover Jennifer Sweeney Sweeney tried to kill her not once but twice a judge said.

The first attempt didn’t work; the second attempt did said Superior Court Judge David F. Bauman.

Bauman on Friday sentenced Sweeney 38 of Tinton Falls to 20 years in prison for the failed attempt on Julius’ life. He sentenced Sweeney to life in prison for the murder of the 41-year-old Linden woman.

Bauman ordered that the two prison terms run consecutively and that Sweeney serve 85% of them before she can be considered for release on parole under the state’s No Early Release Act. As a result Sweeney will be in prison for at least 80 and 3/4 years.

How we got here

After Julius lost interest in Sweeney Sweeney enlisted a high school friend to kill Julius in November 2015 and provided the gun with which to shoot her Bauman said.

Bauman on Friday also sentenced the gunman Andre Harris 38 of Long Branch to 16 years in prison for the failed murder attempt.

When the victim survived the shooting Sweeney took on the role of Julius’ protector in an attempt to rekindle their relationship Bauman said.

Months later Sweeney took advantage of Julius’ physical condition weakened from being shot and strangled her to death with an electrical cord on March 8 2016 for again rebuffing her Bauman said.

When Julius’ mother reported her daughter missing to police Sweeney told authorities she dropped off Julius at the Long Branch train station and never saw her again all along knowing Julius would never be found alive the judge said. She later joined Julius’ friends and relatives in searching for the missing woman the judge said.

“It is difficult to imagine a more heinous scheme of manipulation and cold-hearted depravity over four months than that orchestrated by Jennifer Sweeney’’ Bauman said.

“Evidence at trial then revealed that the defendant denied Miss Julius a proper burial and dumped her in a hole dug by Mr. Harris on his own property’’ Bauman said.

Julius’ family suffered for months not knowing her fate until her body was found five months later in Harris’ backyard said Christopher Decker assistant Monmouth County prosecutor.

Harris admitted his role in the crimes and testified against Sweeney at a trial before Bauman last year.

The jury in September convicted Sweeney of murder attempted murder conspiracy to commit murder desecrating human remains tampering with evidence and weapons offenses.

Maintaining innocence

Sweeney who was employed as a Comcast executive and previously worked as a teacher’s assistant and as a 911 operator for the Monmouth County Sheriff’s Office declined to speak before she was sentenced.

“She loved the victim very much and maintains her innocence’’ said her defense attorney Robin K. Lord. “She did not commit these crimes.’’

Bauman rejected Lord’s request to sentence Sweeney to 30 years in prison.

The judge sentenced Harris under terms of a plea bargain and ordered him to serve 85 percent of the 16-year prison term before he can be considered for release on parole.

Harris pleaded guilty in 2019 to two counts of attempted murder conspiracy to commit murder possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose desecrating human remains and tampering with evidence as well as an unrelated charge of obtaining a controlled dangerous substance by fraud.

Harris testified that Sweeney threatened to kill his children if he didn’t shoot Julius a stranger to him.

“The threats that were made to him he truly believed’’ said Harris’ attorney Allison Friedman. “Those threats involved causing harm to his son and that scared him it scared him to his core because he believed that they would be real that they would be carried out and he loved his family and he wanted to protect his son.’’

Asking for forgiveness

Harris asked Julius’ family for forgiveness.

“I’m so sorry for what I’ve done’’ Harris said turning to the victim’s family and friends gathered in the courtroom some wearing black T-shirts with the words “Team Tyrita” emblazoned on them.

“I don’t know what to say’’ Harris told them. “I’m asking for you to forgive me.’’

Bauman noted that Harris fired eight bullets at close range at Julius as she sat in a car with her teenage daughter near their home in Linden on Nov. 24 2015 as they were about to go watch her son’s basketball game.

Julius seriously injured was hospitalized for 39 days and continued to suffer arm and leg injuries Decker said. Her daughter was grazed by a bullet.

“Miss Julius and her daughter miraculously survived that shooting’’ Bauman said.

“Having first tried to kill Miss Julius in November 2015 defendant Harris four months later committed wholly new acts of criminal depravity by burying Miss Julius in his backyard thereby hiding evidence of Sweeney’s murder on his property’’ the judge said.

Julius’ relatives didn’t speak at Harris’ sentencing hearing on Friday afternoon but they did at Sweeney’s sentencing hearing Friday morning.

“Tyrita’s gone’’ said Queen Julius the victim’s mother crying. “I will forever be heartbroken. She was my child my only daughter.’’

The grieving mother said her daughter “left this world by nightmarish circumstances’’ that she plays out daily in her her mind.

Overcome with emotion the mother handed a written statement she had prepared to recite to the judge to a friend who was at her side who continued to read the statement for her.

“In her last hours she was faced with betrayal brutality and terror at the hands of someone she trusted’’ the friend YoLanda Robinson read from Queen Julius’ statement about the victim. “Her life and future were stolen by a thief disguised as a friend.’’

Those who view science and technology positively trust agricultural biotech companies and possess a good understanding of gene editing technology also are less likely to avoid gene-edited foods.

Consumers more likely to avoid gene-edited foods include older consumers consumers who are more religious women and consumers who are more conservative politically. Consumers who have food beliefs including ethical ones and wondering where food comes from were more likely to say they avoid gene-edited foods too as were consumers who highly trust environmental organizations to monitor gene-edited food technology.

The study involved 2000 US adults drawn from the YouGov’s National Omnibus Panel and appeared online June 1 in Frontiers in Food Science and Technology. The US Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture funded the study.

About 60% of women said they would be unwilling to eat gene-edited foods. About 40% of consumers over age 60 said they would avoid eating and buying gene-edited foods which compared to 22% among millennials and Gen Z. Among consumers earning $40000 to $45000 annually 25% said they would be willing to eat gene-edited foods which compared to 42% for those earning between $125000 and $149000 and nearly 70% among those making over $250000.

“This study highlights a need for better consumer-focused communication and offers a scientific baseline of current US public opinion regarding people’s willingness to eat and purposeful avoidance of GE foods” the study’s authors concluded. “Moving forward we expect that the US public’s willingness to eat and purposeful avoidance of gene edited food will change as they are engaged more readily on the developmental process and products in this area.”

The future of gene-edited foods (GEFs) will be related to the history of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) according to the study. Many non-governmental organizations and consumer advocacy groups regard GEFs as an extension of GMOs according to the study.

Gene-edited foods differ from GMOS. Gene-edited foods involve cisgenic engineering in which scientists use tools like CRISPR Cas ZFN or TALEN to tweak a specific section of DNA in a plant or animal or replace it with genetic material from a sexually compatible species. The genetic change is passed on to its offspring like traditional breeding.

GMOs involve transgenic engineering in which scientists insert genes from another species or genes that were made synthetically into the genome of a plant or animal. The US Food and Drug Administration the US Environmental Protection Agency and the USDA all regulate GMOs.

“Current regulations say gene-edited foods are analogous to traditional selective breeding and therefore do not fall under the same review process as GMOs but some consumer groups trade organizations and environmental groups disagree” said Christopher Cummings PhD senior research fellow at Iowa State University.

Dr. Cummings co-authored the study with David Peters PhD a professor of sociology and a rural sociologist with the ISU Extension and Outreach.

Gene-edited foods may be produced quickly and more cost-effectively than traditional selective breeding or transgenic modification according to the study.

“Right now there are a lot of people in the middle” Dr. Cummings said. “They have not fully made up their mind about gene-edited foods but as they learn more about the technologies and products they will likely move to one side of the issue. I think it will depend on their consumer experience what kind of messaging they trust and who sends it as well as what products they encounter.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

It wasn’t long after 5pm that early November evening. New York WABC radio DJ Dan Ingram was playing Jonathan King’s Everyone’s Gone To The Moon but the recording was playing far below normal speed.

“That was in the key of R” quipped Ingram. The ads sounded weird too and an attempt to play the Si Zentner hit Up A Lazy River as a follow-up resulted in total seize-up. “I don’t know what’s going on in the studio” said Ingram noticing that the studio lights were dimming. Moments later the building was in complete darkness.

Up in Canada at the Sir Adam Beck power station on the Ontario side of Niagara Falls a 230-volt power line had been tripped. So began The Great Blackout a power failure that would plunge the whole of New York State several neighbouring states and parts of eastern Canada into darkness.

“It was the biggest pop happening of the ‘60s really.” Andy Warhol

Rush hour had just got underway and millions of commuters were making their way home. Many were trapped in office buildings elevators and trains airplanes circled the skies unable to land.

One major record store Record Hunter usually stayed open until midnight but the chief buyer recalled: “We asked customers to leave when the lights went out. It was disastrous economically. Many of the employees stayed in the store all night.”

New York’s major R&B radio station WWRL went to auxiliary power and taped music with general manager Frank Ward reporting: “We spent the night trying to keep people calm and cool.”

The Rolling Stones were in town one week into their fourth US tour. They’d booked into the Sheraton City Squire Hotel where female fans caused chaos in their efforts to get within clutching distance of the band. The management politely suggested that the Stones should move elsewhere. They relocated to the Sheraton Lincoln Square where at the height of the blackout Bob Dylan Robbie Robertson and other members of his band paid Brian Jones a visit.

Dylan and The Stones smoke drink and jam by candlelight...

Arriving at the Stone’s suite Dylan declared “It’s an invasion from Mars let’s turn on what better time? The little green men have landed.” And turn on they did smoking drinking and jamming by candlelight until someone knocked a candle on its side setting fire to the nearest bed. According to Greil Marcus “the story goes that the song Visions Of Johanna was written during the Great East Coast Blackout.” It certainly emerged during this period and Dylan would first record it with The Hawks at CBS’s New York studio on November 30.

Another Dylan admirer was in town that night: Andy Warhol star Edie Sedgwick who had a considerable crush on the singer. As the blackout took hold Sedgwick and Warhol were heading back from Philadelphia.

“There was a power cut and we were missing it” Warhol recalled in his book Popism. “All the way back to New York we were hoping that the power cut would be going on when we got there. When we got to the bridge we couldn’t see any lights on the whole Manhattan skyline just car headlights. The moon was full and it was like a big party somehow. We drove through the Village and everyone was dancing around lighting candles.”

The blackout affected 30 million people and remained the biggest disaster of its kind until the Northeast Blackout of August 2003 hit 50 million. Even so the 1965 event was hailed as a time for togetherness. There was little looting and the crime figures for that night hit an all-time low. Tom Paxton wrote a song about the event titled Where Were You When The Lights Went Out? in which one answer ran “Down at Con Edison all through the night where they kept on saying things would be all right.”

Con Edison the power company responsible for the outage did get it right eventually and power returned to the various areas by morning.",,,,,,,,,

Officials said a $5 million one-to-one matching pledge along with additional matching gifts created the Sands Family Foundation Initiative for Creativity Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Skidmore College.

A century ago Lucy Skidmore Scribner founded Skidmore College with the vision that it would help students connect the power of their minds and their hands in a new model of liberal education college officials said. That ambition takes a dramatic step forward with the new initiative said college President Marc C. Conner.

“This extraordinary gift celebrates what Skidmore has always done—nurture creativity and prepare students for life after graduation—and moves us forward in our ability to offer the very model for a 21st liberal arts education” Conner said.

“The essence of innovation and entrepreneurship is an eagerness to be bold take risks look at tough problems with fresh eyes and be unafraid to fail—the hallmarks of a great liberal arts education. This gift from the Sands Family Foundation emphasizes the incredible impact that our commitment to developing exceptional creative and critical skills can have on students” said Conner.

Rob Sands a Skidmore business major graduate who is executive chairman of the board of directors of Constellation Brands explained his personal commitment to this gift.

“At Skidmore I gained the fundamental knowledge to become a successful attorney and businessman along with an invaluable set of life skills” he said. “The Sands Family Foundation Initiative promises to support and grow these aspects of the education I experienced at Skidmore—exactly the kind of education I believe our world needs. We are so excited to spearhead the expansion of entrepreneurial thinking for all Skidmore students and my hope is that through this support students will use their talents upon graduation to create or grow new ventures from the Capital District to Rochester and beyond.”

Sands Family Foundation member Bill Caleo a Skidmore business major who went on to attain his master’s degree in theater and is now a member of the college’s board of trustees stressed the promise of the gift to build on Skidmore’s creative inclusive and interdisciplinary education.

“I’m so proud to be able to support my alma mater with this gift” he said. “I want the world to see that a Skidmore education is truly the best preparation for the 21st century. Our gift is going to provide programmatic support for the kind of entrepreneurial thinking that is a natural and fundamental part of the college. This will literally enable students to learn how to shape their own future.”

College officials said that at Skidmore entrepreneurship is an ethos and commitment to helping students think and make with the creativity that the global marketplace demands. The college offers existing programs such as the Entrepreneurial Artist Initiative the Skidmore-Saratoga Consulting Partnership and the Kenneth A. Freirich ’90 Entrepreneurship Competition. It offers collaborative spaces for innovative practice such as the nascent Schupf Family IdeaLab the newly created Center for Integrated Sciences and the Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery.

“The Sands Family Foundation Initiative for Creativity Innovation and Entrepreneurship will channel support to these programs and to similar initiatives in the coming years further establishing Skidmore as a model liberal arts college for the skills experiences and abilities that will help our students thrive in the 21st century” Conner said.

Founded in 1903 Skidmore College is a private coeducational liberal arts college of about 2500 students.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL2NyYWZ0LWJlZXItYnJld2Vycy1zZWNyZXRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,11 Secrets Craft Beer Brewers Don't Want You to Know,"If you've grabbed a six-pack of beer or a cold one at a bar lately chances are you've had a craft beer–that is a beer brewed by a smaller often local brewery. According to the Brewers Association there are 7450 craft brewers in the United States alone like Fargo Brewing in North Dakota Bells in Michigan and Shipyard in Maine. With the craft beer craze showing no signs of slowing down we dug into what you might not know about your local brewery–and the secrets craft beer brewers don't want you to know! Plus check out: These Are the 25 Worst Beers in the World New Data Says

Surprise some of your favorite craft brews are owned by big beer.

With more people picking up craft beer as their beverage of choice it's not really surprising that deep-pocketed brewers like Anheuser-Busch are buying out some of your favorite local brews. Take Chicago-based Goose Island for example Anheuser-Busch bought Goose Island in 2011 in 2014 Grand Rapids Michigan's beloved Founders sold 30 percent of its organization to Mahou San Miguel Spain's largest brewing company and Constellation Brands added Florida's Funky Buddha Brewing to its portfolio which includes Ballast Point and Corona in 2017.

Craft brewers aren't beer snobs.

Despite what you may think about micro brewers being precious about what they'll drink they appreciate the classics as well. Shaun O'Sullivan co-founder and brewmaster of 21st Amendment Brewery admitted to VinePair that Coors Light is his guilty pleasure and Augie Carton Founder Carton Brewing loves a cold Guinness.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

REALTED: This Is the World's Most Favorite Beer New Data Says

Quality assurance can be an issue.

Another slightly scary thing the brewing insider told Thrillist is that smaller breweries just don't have the resources and staff to make sure every beer is perfectly brewed. ""Some breweries package on a small scale and their beers will have diacetyl and off-flavors because they do mobile–they haven't invested in infrastructure and quality assurance"" the insider said. ""They don't have labs to test to make sure that if there's an infection they can track it.""

Craft beers can cost over $200!

Okay so most brews are in the five to ten dollar range but Utopias a limited-release dark ale blend from Sam Adams also happens to be America's most expensive craft beer with a suggested retail price of $210 per bottle. The ruby-black Utopias are aged in used spirits barrels and have a 28% ABV Barron's reports.

4 Major Effects Drinking Beer Has on Your Health New Study Says

You can get a craft beer made with an interesting cow body part.

If you're into craft beer you're probably used to some unusual flavors and styles–the first time you have a sour beer it can be pretty interesting. But there are some super experimental styles that you might want to skip like Wynkoop Brewing Co.'s Rocky Mountain Oyster Stout. Yep each barrel of this beer contains three bull testicles and was originally created as an April Fool's Day joke.

Many brews are high-calorie.

Just because craft brewers are small and often locally owned doesn't mean some of them aren't packed with calories. Sierra Nevada Hoptimum is a whopping 314 calories and 24 grams of carbs per serving and the brand's Torpedo brew comes in at 236 calories and 20.6 grams of carbs. Enjoy these in moderation if you're watching your waistline.

The Worst Drinks on the Planet

Intense rivalries have sprung up between brewers.

These businesses are more than just hobbies and there's a lot of money to be made. An anonymous brewery insider told Thrillist ""There are breweries much bigger than us that don't have as much growth as we do. As wonderful as it is to go to festivals and see other breweries there's that feeling of 'Oh God we're not a big happy loving family anymore. We're competitors.'""

However Sam Adams helps small businesses.

Breweries like Boston Beer Co. which is the company behind Sam Adams beers have a program to offer loans to other small businesses. ""We've provided startup loans to over 30 craft brewers"" Jim Koch Boston Beer Co.'s founder told CNBC. ""This is counterintuitive to most people. Why would you help your competition? Craft brewers help craft brewers because we believe.""

This Major Beer Brand's New Product Is So Strong It's Outlawed in 15 States

Craft brewers create products they like.

While you may associate craft beers with hoppy heady IPAs one of the secrets to their success is finding a niche and filling it. One example? Hard seltzer. ""I wanted to create this product for moms like me"" Amy Wahlberg founder of PRESS Premium Hard Seltzer told Forbes. ""Taking inspiration from my favorite pre-kids cocktail of choice a vodka press I turned my kitchen into a mixology lab.""

You won't make a ton of money working for a craft brewery.

If you love craft beers tried your hand at home brewing and dream of one day working for your favorite local brewery be warned it will be a labor of love. ​​Head brewers working in small brewpubs on average earn a yearly salary of $46000 and in larger brewpubs they average around $51000 per year. Brewers who work in small breweries make an average of $42500 a year according to JustBeer.

Craft breweries have a 'white dudes with beards' problem

Unfortunately the perception that women don't work in brewing is somewhat true according to Civil Eats. In 2019 a survey by the Brewers Association of the 9000 narrowly defined independently owned craft breweries (those brewing fewer than six million barrels a year) showed that gender demographics within the industry skew heavily male with women making up only 22.6 percent of craft brewery owners.

Victoria Coates who served as senior advisor to the energy secretary in the Trump administration said in a tweet on Saturday that if Musk can provide internet via satellite constellation Starlink for the Ukrainians “why can't we blast it into Khuzestan and let these brave Iranians communicate?”

Since Friday morning internet connection was shut off or significantly slowed down in oil-rich province of Khuzestan a development usually signaling protests in Iran.

Authorities disrupt the Internet to prevent news of unrest reaching the rest of the country and abroad. It is also done to prevent protesters from galvanizing support in nearby regions.

Operated by Elon Musk’s company SpaceX Starlink provides internet access coverage to most of the Earth. As Ukraine's internet service has been disrupted by Russia's invasion Musk made internet available in the country in February.

Following the move by Musk Iran’s former communication minister Mohammad-Javad Azari-Jahromi warned Iran’s parliament against plans to restrict Internet access saying that “if you do not provide people with the right service others will”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvMDcvc2NpZW5jZS9zcGFjZS9hc3Ryb25vbXktYmxhY2staG9sZS1zb3VuZC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hear the Weird Sounds of a Black Hole Singing (Published 2022),"In space you can’t hear a black hole scream but apparently you can hear it sing.

In 2003 astrophysicists working with NASA’s orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory detected a pattern of ripples in the X-ray glow of a giant cluster of galaxies in the constellation Perseus. They were pressure waves — that is to say sound waves — 30000 light-years across and radiating outward through the thin ultrahot gas that suffuses galaxy clusters. They were caused by periodic explosions from a supermassive black hole at the center of the cluster which is 250 million light-years away and contains thousands of galaxies.

With a period of oscillation of 10 million years the sound waves were acoustically equivalent to a B-flat 57 octaves below middle C a tone that the black hole has apparently been holding for the last two billion years. Astronomers suspect that these waves act as a brake on star formation keeping the gas in the cluster too hot to condense into new stars.

The Chandra astronomers recently “sonified” these ripples by speeding up the signals to 57 or 58 octaves above their original pitch boosting their frequency quadrillions of times to make them audible to the human ear. As a result the rest of us can now hear the intergalactic sirens singing.

Through these new cosmic headphones the Perseus black hole makes eerie moans and rumbles that reminded this listener of the galumphing tones marking an alien radio signal that Jodie Foster hears through headphones in the science fiction film “Contact.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaXZlcnNldG9kYXkuY29tLzE1NTc4NS9hLWdpYW50LWdhbGF4eS1oYXMtYmVlbi11bndpbmRpbmctaXRzLW5laWdoYm9yLWZvci00MDAtbWlsbGlvbi15ZWFycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Giant Galaxy has been Unwinding its Neighbor for 400 Million Years,"The interacting galaxy pair NGC 1512 and NGC 1510 take center stage in this image from the Dark Energy Camera a state-of-the art wide-field imager on the Víctor M. Blanco 4-meter Telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. Courtesy NOIRLab.

Sometimes you have to just sit back and marvel at a particularly gorgeous view of a galaxy interaction. When these giant space cities merge with each other wild and crazy things happen—a sort of “Galaxies Gone Wild” scenario. Take this pair for example. We see them locked together in a cosmic dance that has lasted for not quite a half-billion years. With each turn on the intergalactic dance floor they change each other permanently. Eventually they’ll combine to make one giant galaxy.

NGC 1512 (left) is the larger of the two galaxies. It’s a barred spiral that looks like it’s unwinding as the interaction plays out. Its smaller companion is a dwarf lenticular galaxy (to its lower right) called NGC 1510. They both lie in the direction of the constellation Horologium and are about 60 million light-years away from us. The Victor M. Blanco 4-meter telescope in Chile caught this view of the pair’s galaxy interaction.

What Happens in a Galaxy Merger?

Galaxies lie far apart in space but they interact with each other throughout cosmic time. The dances they do are how they grow and change. This includes our own Milky Way. In fact our galaxy is currently gobbling up some smaller dwarf galaxies adding their distinctive stars to the larger population of the Milky Way.

The galaxy interaction of NGC 1510 and NGC 1512 is a good example of what happens during the merger process. Their gravitational attraction to each other spurred great waves of star formation particularly in the outer spiral arms of the larger galaxy. That created what astronomers call “starbursts” and splashed long blue strings of hot young stars out to space. Galaxy mergers often spur bouts of star formation. Someday these massive stars will explode as supernovae and add a bit of a fireworks display to the long galactic dance.

In addition NGC 1512’s smaller gravitational pull has pulled gas dust and stars away from its larger neighbor creating wispy tendrils extending out through space. It also looks like it’s “unwinding” the spiral arms on the more-massive neighbor.

A cropped view of the main image shows the tendrils of hot young stars created during the starburst phase of the galaxy interaction. Courtesy NOIRLab.

NGC 1510 affects its small companion pulling tendrils of gas and dust away. The interaction is also distorting the shapes of both galaxies. Things will only get worse for both of them as time goes by. Ultimately they’ll merge completely with each other to form a giant galaxy probably an elliptical one. But that’s way far in the future.

Capturing the View

This galactic dance scene is part of a larger image captured by the Blanco Telescope outfitted with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). The DECam was built for use by the Dark Energy Survey. That’s a project to map hundreds of millions of galaxies and detect supernovae. Ultimately the idea is to look for patterns in cosmic structure that give clues to the nature of dark energy. That’s a mysterious “something” that is accelerating the expansion of the universe. The survey lasted six years. During that time the DECam recorded information about 300 million galaxies across 5000 square degrees of the southern skies.

While we can’t see dark energy directly we can appreciate the survey’s incredibly detailed images of galaxies like this one and the results of such a fantastic galaxy interaction. If you look closely at this wide-field view you can see even more distant galaxies forming a backdrop to the two interacting ones.

Copart UK's new operation centre will take over the former Motorola and Jeyes factory sites doubling their operational capabilities in Scotland.

Originally announced last year work is now due to start on the new centre supporting Copart’s continued growth alongside their existing centre in Whitburn and recycling centre in Inverkeithing.

The venture is expected to bring many new job opportunities to the local area including drivers yard operatives and customer service representatives and will be fully operational in 2023.

Regeneration of the derelict site is sure to be welcomed locally following East Kilbride's long line of lost industry over the last decade.

In 2013 cleaning product firm Jeyes confirmed they were closing their factory with the loss of 110 jobs. The Kelvin factory had operated since 1970.

And semi-conductor maker Freescale who had a research and development base in Kelvin Industrial Estate – a facility established by Motorola in 1969 – ceased manufacturing in 2009 which led to the loss of around 850 jobs.

Phil Briggs from Copart UK told Lanarkshire Live : “We’re passionate about continuously growing and improving our services to customers so we’re very excited to secure final planning permission for our new operation centre in East Kilbride which will provide annual storage capacity for over 49000 vehicles.

“Alongside our existing 30-acre site in Whitburn it offers the potential for Copart to handle around 100000 cars per year across Scotland doubling our operational capabilities in this part of the UK.

""With extreme weather events increasing in Scotland the provision of latent storage capacity is more important than ever.”

This expansion in Scotland is part of Copart’s ambitious growth and investment programme to meet continued demand from their customers including most of the UK’s major insurance companies and thousands of nationwide automotive customers.

The company’s extensive reinvestment strategy combines a programme of land acquisition with continuous improvement at existing sites and reinvestment in transport services and technology.

East Kilbride is a strategic location close to Glasgow with good transport links which gives Copart and its customers a significant northern hub.

The provision of further storage capacity and scale will also increase the geographical reach of their fast and efficient surge management services in response to an increasing number of extreme weather events in Scotland.

As part of Copart’s ongoing sustainability refurbishment programme facilities at the new site will be constructed responsibly and designed to be inclusive energy efficient and eco-friendly.

In addition to her cemetery committee role she was also an Election Site Lead to secure accurate voting and area BINGO Inspector.

However if you also pay for a membership at Costco it’s to your advantage to comparison shop before you click the “Place Your Order” button on Amazon.

Find Out: 50 Ways You’re Throwing Money Away

See: 6 Bad Habits That Hike Up Your Grocery Bill

While Costco doesn’t have the mind-blowing variety of items that Amazon does it does have competitive delivery options. You also might be surprised at how much you can save on daily-use items — savings that can add up month after month. To help you see the savings potential here are 11 items to buy at Costco instead of Amazon including current price comparisons.

Huggies Diapers

“Prices will range at both stores but a 180-count package of diapers at Amazon will run around $53 which is about 29 cents per diaper” said consumer analyst Julie Ramhold with DealNews. “That’s not terrible but you can get a pack of 192 Huggies diapers from Costco for around $45 which is about 24 cents per diaper. When you’re having to buy a ton of these items that 4-5 cents savings per diaper can really add up; plus you’re getting more in one package which should help to reduce how often you have to buy them when you shop at Costco.”

Alive! Women’s Multi-Vitamin

At Costco you can purchase a bottle of 200 tablets for $22.97 or 12 cents per tablet. However the catch is that the price is only available if you purchase the item at Costco.com so you won’t be able to pick up the item on your regular Costco runs.

But when you compare the Costco price to what you’ll pay for the item at Amazon — only 130 tablets for $24.67 or almost 19 cents per pill — it’s a no-brainer to buy a larger quantity of these multi-vitamins at a lower price from Costco.

Baby Wipes

“This is another thing that new parents will likely be buying a lot of and if you shop at Amazon you can expect to find packages of around 336 wipes for about $12” Ramhold said.

“That’s about 4 cents per wipe which definitely isn’t bad. But if you shop at Costco you can find boxes of 900 wipes for around $22 — that’s about 2 cents per wipe. In addition to those savings you’re also buying a large amount and as with the diapers it helps to reduce the amount of times you have to purchase them.”

POLL: Do You Think Student Loan Debt Should Be Forgiven?

Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Microwavable Cups 12-Count

You’ll pay a premium to get these mac-and-cheese cups from Amazon — $19.23 for 12 cups which equals $1.60 per cup. However if you opt to buy them at Costco you’ll pay just $11.09 for the same item which equals 93 cents per cup and a savings of $8.14 overall.

Story continues

Note that this is an online-only item at Costco that’s eligible for two-day delivery so if you don’t order at least $75 worth of two-day delivery items you’ll pay an additional $3 delivery fee which will bring your total to $15.09. Still you’ll save over $5 on this item at Costco as compared to purchasing from Amazon.

Charmin Toilet Paper

“At Amazon you can expect to pay around $33 for 24 rolls but at Costco you can buy a pack of 30 rolls for around $31” said Ramhold. “While the outright savings don’t seem like that much — especially if you get free shipping via a Prime membership — the price per roll works out to be much better at Costco. You’ll pay $1.03 per roll at the warehouse club versus $1.38 per roll (or more) at Amazon.”

K. Bell No-Show Sock

You can get 20 pairs of K. Bell No-Show Socks for $19.99 at Costco. Plus Costco’s website states that you might be able to get these socks at an even lower price in your local warehouse. At Amazon however the pack only contains nine pairs of socks and you’ll pay $2.44 per pair — over double the cost you’ll pay at Costco.

Dixie Ultra Paper Plates

“If you prefer to use paper plates whether for crafts or meals Costco is the way to go” Ramhold said. “At Amazon a 172-count package of the Dixie Ultra plates will cost around $36 which is about 21 cents per plate. But at Costco you can get a package of 186 for $24 which is a much more affordable 13 cents per plate. Getting more for less makes this a no-brainer. These are specifically the 10 1/6 inch plates but you can also buy 8 1/2 inch Dixie Ultra plates at Costco for an even better deal — $25 for 285 plates or about 9 cents per plate.”

San Francisco Bay French Roast Coffee Pods

“Sure Amazon offers more flavors overall and you can get a 120-count box of the pods there for around $50 but that comes out to about 42 cents per cup” said Ramhold. “At Costco you’ll be restricted to a 100-count box but it’ll only set you back $36 or 36 cents per cup. And if you wait for them to go on sale at Costco you’ll get an even better deal — prices can drop to $30 or less when they’re on sale at the warehouse club which means you can get this excellent coffee for about 31 cents a cup or less depending on the sale.”

Skippy Peanut Butter

If you or someone in your family is a peanut butter fan Costco has two 48-ounce jars of Skippy SuperChunk Peanut Butter for $10.49 which is about $5.24 per jar. At Amazon you’ll pay $11.98 or almost $1.50 more if you order the same two-pack.

Tide Pods

If Tide Pods are your go-to laundry solution Costco definitely has a better deal. You can get 168 HE Laundry Detergent Pods in Spring Meadow scent for $35.49 which equals 21 cents per pod. At Amazon you’ll pay $21.24 for 81 pods which is around 26 cents per pod or a 5-cent savings per laundry load.

Quaker Instant Oatmeal

“Costco only has a couple of varieties available — Fruit & Cream or another variety pack — but they’re both much better at the warehouse club than what you’ll find at Amazon” said Ramhold.

“The online retailer offers a 44-pack box of the Fruit & Cream variety pack for around $16 which works out to 36 cents per pack. At Costco the same variety is $10.49 although that’s for a 40 count box; still that comes to 26 cents per pack which beats Amazon. If you prefer the other variety pack — with classic flavors like apples & cinnamon maple & brown sugar and cinnamon & spice — Costco will cost you $14.49 for 52 packs or about 28 cents per pack. At Amazon the exact same product will cost you around $15 or 29 cents per pack.”

Whether you're stocking up for breakfast dinnertime snack time or dessert there's something to discover in the frozen aisle at your favorite Costco warehouse.

While all the stores are a little bit different from each other shoppers know what to look for thanks to social media and especially Reddit. The community of Costco fans is widespread and chatty — they're always happy to share their finds and help their fellow Costco-lovers do the same.

We poked around the internet to see what Costco shoppers are loving from the freezer section right now and this is what we found. (And when you're at the warehouse next These Are Costco's Most Popular Items Right Now.)

Heavenfull Stroopwafel Ice Cream Sandwich

Costco shoppers spotted these sweet treats popping up in the freezer section at their local warehouses and they can't get enough. In early May One Redditor said they'd bought a box at the beginning of the year and at them ""all in a week"" adding ""These are AMAZING.""

Plenty of other commenters on the original Reddit post about the dessert sandwiches raved over trying to get their hands on a box for themselves. With stroopwafel outsides a caramel filling and ice cream in the middle you really can't go wrong here. According to the post a box of 12 sandwiches is $13.49 in the warehouse.

Cuisine Adventures Cubano Inspired Bites

Perfect for snack time or dinner time these handheld frozen bites are filled with ham mozzarella swiss pulled pork and a little bit of dill pickle for flavor.

Popular Costco Instagram account @CostcoGuide found these recently for $8.99 and a few commenters said they thought they were seasonal. One commenter said they make a great little nibble if you have guests over and another pointed out how tasty they are!

Kirkland Signature Ready to Freeze Lime Drop Popsicles

Perfect for the warmer weather ahead these Kirkland Signature alcoholic popsicles found in the frozen section at Costco are drawing plenty of attention recently on Reddit with a post highlighting an empty tube. While the original poster inquired about how many it would take to feel a buzz from these commenters chimed in with that answer as well as their affinity for these cooling treats. Many people pointed out the sugar content which is certainly fairly high but for a treat now and then during the summer it's not so bad.

Just Bare Chicken Nuggets

Just Bare's nuggets aren't new by any means but they're a perennial favorite among Costco shoppers. They're always being talked about and raved about by fans on Reddit including someone who just discovered them. In a Reddit post in early May the new fan wrote ""Im upset about how much I love them half of my paycheck is now going to go to nuggets. I'm going to have to start a chicken nugget fund instead of a boat fund.""

We're also fans of Just Bare's chicken — and even think they stack up to Chick-fil-A like people say — but like many Redditors who pointed it out we're also bummed that the price on these just went up. They're worth the spend though for a good source of protein and a yummy meal.

When legendary investor Warren Buffett looks for stocks to own he emphasizes businesses that possess some sort of competitive advantage. This key characteristic is important for long-term investors because it signifies a company does things better than its rivals resulting in improved financials faster growth and hopefully a rising stock price.

Taking a look at Costco (COST 1.96%) we'll see a successful business that has gotten even stronger over time. The operator of warehouse clubs has one critical advantage that has allowed it to thrive throughout its history: its scale.

Let's take a closer look at what makes this company so special.

Costco is a massive business

For the second quarter of fiscal 2022 (ended Feb. 13) Costco posted net revenue of $50.9 billion. This is a gargantuan amount and it makes the business which today has 829 warehouses worldwide the third-largest retailer in the world. Costco's sheer scale is why it has been such an outstanding investment.

Because a Costco location carries fewer than 4000 stock-keeping units (SKUs) -- compared to tens of thousands at typical general retailers -- it is able to place bigger orders with its vendors. This bargaining power results in favorable inventory costs. A smaller retailer that sells toilet paper for example would pay more to its supplier on a per-unit basis than Costco does. This is a huge advantage.

""Costco is able to offer lower prices and better values by eliminating virtually all the frills and costs historically associated with conventional wholesalers and retailers including salespeople fancy buildings delivery billing and accounts receivable"" said CEO Craig Jelinek. ""We run a tight operation with extremely low overhead which enables us to pass dramatic savings to our members.""

In summary higher revenue translates to greater buying power with suppliers. And these savings attract more members which ultimately results in higher sales. This virtuous cycle is unstoppable and it's what makes Costco a one-of-a-kind business.

Focusing on the customer

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos built his company with a focus on customer obsession. I think Costco operates with the same playbook. The mentality is to always be trying to find ways to add more value.

As of Feb. 13 Costco counted 114.8 million memberships. In the U.S. and Canada the renewal rate of 92% last fiscal quarter is excellent. This underscores the unquestionable value that consumers see in being a Costco shopper. Especially throughout the past couple years having a membership during the pandemic has been a no-brainer as people could purchase all of their necessities like cleaning products and groceries in one stop.

The company offers up a treasure-hunt atmosphere where shoppers can find rare unique deals on items that encourages visiting frequently walking the entire store and purchasing urgency. Costco is also known for its superb customer service helping to drive more revenue.

Costco's relentless focus on the customer is clear by the fact that the average markup on merchandise is just 11% far lower than 24% at Walmart and 35% at Home Depot. Because most of the profit comes from membership fees which totaled $4 billion over the trailing 12 months the business is able to keep a lid on prices. Again it all goes back to Costco's colossal size.

This scenario has resulted in an unmatched customer value proposition. And when shoppers form habits around a business and what it offers it's hard for that momentum to stop. Costco's massive scale has allowed the company to take care of its employees customers and shareholders. This powerful situation is why the stock has climbed 500% over the past decade.

While I think Costco shares are currently on the expensive side with a price-to-earnings ratio of 40 it still remains one of the most outstanding businesses out there. Investors should keep the stock on their watch lists for now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL2RhaWx5dm9pY2UuY29tL25ldy15b3JrL2NhcGl0YWwtZGlzdHJpY3QvYnVzaW5lc3MvcGxhbnMtZm9yLWNhcGl0YWwtZGlzdHJpY3RzLWZpcnN0LWNvc3Rjby1tb3ZlLWZvcndhcmQtYWZ0ZXItY291cnQtcnVsaW5nLXJlcG9ydC1zYXlzLzgzMTc5OS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Plans For Capital District's First Costco Move Forward After Court Ruling Report Says,"The 160000-square-foot membership-only store is slated to go up on Western Avenue near Crossgates Mall in Albany.

Kayla is one of 30 Indian Lake/Ohio Hi-Point Career Center FFA students who attended the two-day convention in Columbus. She also serves as president of the ILHS-OHP FFA.

A few weeks ago Cummins attended the Sunrise Cooperative Career Day and applied for the Sunrise University job training program.

She went through a series of interviews with Sunrise and the FFA Council. They offered her a spot in their four-year job placement program which she accepted.

This process put her in the running as one of five finalists for the 2021 Jeep Gladiator which the State FFA President has been using to travel this school year.

During a ceremony on stage at Thursday’s convention Cummins was announced as the winner of the vehicle.

Belleville IL. (5/7/22) Kyle Cummins would use late-race dramatics at Macon Speedway to seal his first career Lucas Oil POWRi National & West Midget League presented by Realty Connect feature victory after an intense thirty-lap thriller.

Early Lucas Oil POWRi National Midget League competition of the twenty-four entries would find Joe B Miller clock the quickest hot-lap time with an 11.036-second lap. Cannon McIntosh Jade Avedisian and Chase McDermand would all notch heat racing victories with Kyle Cummins earning the high-point qualifier award after racing from starting seventh to finishing second to earn the feature’s first starting spot.

Launching the field on the initial green flag launch would find Kyle Cummins and Cannon McIntosh battling intently into turns one and two with McIntosh gaining the early running advantage over the field of hungry POWRi National Midget League competitors.

Leading for the majority of the feature event McIntosh would appear to be well on his way to capturing the feature victory until late-race restarts would bunch the field back together and give Kyle Cummins a chance at high-side hustling to the front.

Using the final few laps of diamond-driving the corners Kyle Cummins would snatch the victory away from McIntosh and hold the front for the final laps of the thirty-lap feature event.

“I simply don’t like running the bottom” said a victorious Kyle Cummins in the Macon Speedway victory lane. Adding “This means a lot for this whole team I have never been here before and the crew really won this for me this car was awesome tonight”.

Macon Speedway event would witness Cummins securing his initial career POWRi National Midget League victory as one-time leader McIntosh placed a close runner-up and with Chase McDermand finishing in a hard-fought third position. Taylor Reimer and Maria Cofer would battle late with Reimer gaining the advantage to earn fourth and leaving Cofer to round out the Lucas Oil POWRi National Midget League top-five in the fantastic feature finale.

KKR pacer Pat Cummins had the time of his life when he tasted Mumbai's popular street food pav bhaji for the first time in his life. The Australian cricketer who has been visiting India for the last eleven years hadn't tried the dish ever. Pat Cummins recently asked his Mumbaikar fans and followers on Twitter to suggest to him some local delicacy that he must try for dinner. From several recommendations he narrowed it down to pav bhaji vada pav and misal pav.

And finally the cricketer tried pav bhaji and took to Twitter to share a glimpse of his dinner as he posted a pic of Pav Bhaji. His fans who were curious to know his feedback after trying the dish asked him to share his reactions online. Cummins then expressed that he was amazed and delighted after trying Pav Bhaji.

His team Kolkata Knight Riders also replied to his post and hoped that he had put ""extra butter"" in his bhaji.

The shortage has led retailers including CVS Target and Walgreens to limit purchases of infant formula.

Shortages are even worse in some states: Tennessee Texas Missouri Iowa South Dakota and North Dakota face supply shortages higher than 50%.

The ongoing infant formula shortage isn't over yet – and appears to be getting worse.

Nearly 40% of popular baby formula brands were sold out at retailers across the U.S. during the week starting April 24 according to an analysis by Datasembly which assessed supplies at more than 11000 stores.

That's up from an already-high out-of-stock percentage of 31% two weeks ago Datasembly said.

Major retailers including CVS Target and Walgreens are limiting the amount of formula shoppers can purchase.

Walgreens continues to limit shoppers to three infant and toddler formula products per transaction Walgreens Boots Alliance spokesman Steve Cohen said. ""Due to increased demand and various supplier challenges infant and toddler formulas are seeing constraint across the country"" he said.

'Back at square one':Alabama police find abandoned SUV but escaped inmate officer still missing

The situation is the same at CVS which limits three baby formula products per purchase in its stores and online according to a statement to USA TODAY from CVS Health which owns the pharmacy chain. ""We’re continuing to work with our baby formula vendors to address this issue and we regret any inconvenience this causes our customers"" the statement continued.

Target is also limiting shoppers to up to four formula products at a time the retailer told CBS News.

After recently visiting three different stores in one day last month Elyssa Schmier the vice president of government relations for advocacy group MomsRising""all of a sudden realized my formula was nowhere to be found"" she told USA TODAY. ""It's almost a full-time job trying to find Similac.""

Infant formula recalls worsen situation

Exacerbating the problem has been a voluntary recall Abbott Nutrition issued in mid-February recalling select batches of Similac Alimentum and EleCare formulas made in Sturgis Michigan. That recall was expanded in late February to include one lot of Similac PM 60/40.

Subsequently the Food and Drug Administration in March issued preliminary findings about the formula maker's failure to maintain sanitary conditions and procedures at that plant.

The FDA continues to investigate the situation at Abbott and is ""working with Abbott on safe resumption of production at the Sturgis Michigan facility"" it says in a notice about the recall on its website.

""We are aware the recall has created new concerns about the availability of certain types of infant formula particularly given the overall strains on supply chains experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic"" the FDA said. ""We will continue discussion with Abbott Nutrition and other infant formula manufacturers and consider all tools available to support the supply of infant formula products.""

An Abbott spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal on Friday the company found that the formula made at that plant ""is not likely the source of infection in the reported cases and that there was not an outbreak caused by products from the facility.""

As it awaits the reopening of that plant Abbott is trying to increase Similac production at its other plants and is shipping formula from Europe the Journal reported.

Similarly the maker of Enfamil has its factories running constantly to increase supply the Reckitt Benckiser Group told the Journal.

The company has ""ample supply"" but baby formula sales in the U.S. are up 18% which is ""more than double"" birth rates Reckitt told CBS News.

Reckitt has ""taken a number of measures – including shipping over 30% more product in Q1 running our factories 24/7 with 3 shifts per day and rationalizing our portfolio to focus on those sizes that allow us to provide the most formula"" the company said in a statement to USA TODAY. ""We have also significantly increased our quality assurance resources to make sure our rigorous safety standards are maintained.""

Where the formula shortage is worst

Baby formula shortages began to emerge near the end of November 2021 when about 11% of popular brands were out of stock Datasembly said. Prior to that during most of 2021 supply was ""relatively stable and (shortages) fluctuated between 2%-8%"" the research firm said in its most recent report.

The recalls supply chain shortages and inflation have affected the baby formula supply said Datasembly CEO and founder Ben Reich in the report.

“Unfortunately baby formula out-of-stock levels have continued to soar since the beginning of April and we see no indication of a slow down"" he said. Baby formula continues ""demonstrating higher out-of-stock levels than other categories"" Reich said/in an email exchange with USA TODAY.

Shortages are even worse in some states and cities.

Six states – Tennessee Texas Missouri Iowa South Dakota and North Dakota – faced supply shortages higher than 50% the week starting April 24 Datasembly said. The metro area with the highest out-of-supply rate was San Antonio with 57% followed by Memphis & Nashville (52%) and Des Moines & Houston (50%).

Ron DeSantis (R) as a recent example.

The latest blurring of the lines between business and politics however was sparked by the leaked draft majority opinion suggesting the Supreme Court is poised to overturn federal abortion rights as protected under 1973's Roe v. Wade. Here's where tech giants and leading businesses stand so far:

Airbnb: 'We will work to make sure our employees have the resources they need'

In a request for comment regarding the leaked opinion and its resulting expected effect on employee healthcare vacation rental company Airbnb told The San Francisco Standard that the company's ""healthcare coverage supports reproductive rights and we will work to make sure our employees have the resources they need to make choices about their reproductive rights as we committed to last fall"" in the wake of Texas' extreme six-week abortion ban.

Amazon: Up to $4000 a year in travel expenses

Amazon the nation's second-largest private employer has offered to cover up to $4000 a year in travel expenses for employees seeking non-threatening medical care including abortions if said care is unavailable within 100 miles of their residence and virtual care is not possible.

Apple: 'Actively monitoring the legal proceedings'

Tech giant Apple which has a large presence in Texas has said its health insurance covers both abortions and related travel fees. It appears Apple's policy has been in place since at least September 2021 when it confirmed to TechCrunch that it was keeping an eye on the legal challenges surrounding the Texas ban.

""We are actively monitoring the legal proceedings challenging the uniquely restrictive abortion law in Texas"" Apple wrote in an employee memo. ""In the meantime we want to remind you that our benefits at Apple are comprehensive and that they allow our employees to travel out-of-state for medical care if it is unavailable in their home state.""

Bumble and Match Group: 'We believe strongly in women's right to choose'

Online dating app Bumble commented on Monday's draft leak the following evening. ""The headlines today regarding the leaked draft opinion to overturn abortion rights in the United States are profoundly unsettling"" the company wrote on Twitter. ""At Bumble we believe strongly in women's right to choose and exercise complete control over their bodies.""

In September both Bumble and fellow dating app service Match Group separately announced they would each be launching relief funds for Texas employees in need of out-of-state abortion care. ""As I have said before the company generally does not take political stands unless it is relevant to our business"" Match Group CEO Shar Dubey said in a memo at the time. ""But in this instance I personally as a woman in Texas could not keep silent.""

Citigroup: A target of House Republicans

In March Citigroup became the first major bank to announce it would pay travel costs for employees affected by the abortion ban in Texas where it employs over 8000 workers. ""In response to changes in reproductive health care laws in certain states in the U.S. beginning in 2022 we provide travel benefits to facilitate access to adequate resources"" the bank said in a filing.

Citigroup subsequently came under fire for its decision; House Republicans urged the U.S. to cancel government contracts with the bank and a Texas lawmaker threatened to introduce a bill preventing Citigroup from underwriting municipal bonds.

CVS Health: 'We've made out-of-state care accessible and affordable'

In response to a request for comment on the draft opinion from Fortune CVS offered the following: ""We're monitoring the situation closely and evaluating how we can best support the coverage needs of our colleagues clients and consumers. We've made out-of-state care accessible and affordable for employees in states that have instituted more restrictive laws.""

Levi Strauss: 'Business leaders need to make their voices heard'

""Given what is at stake business leaders need to make their voices heard and act to protect the health and well-being of our employees"" Levi Strauss wrote in a statement released Wednesday. ""That means protecting reproductive rights."" The clothing brand is also reimbursing employees for travel expenses incurred while seeking health-care services unavailable in their state including abortions. Part-time hourly workers are able to seek reimbursement as well.

Salesforce: Helping employee families relocate out of Texas

Software company Salesforce offered in September to help employees and their families relocate out of Texas following the passage of its abortion law.

Salesforce did not take an explicit stance on the Texas law in its statement CNN noted at the time.

Uber and Lyft: Creating legal defense funds

Both Uber and Lyft each announced in September they'd be creating legal defense funds to help drivers sued under the Texas law which financially incentivizes and deputizes private citizens to sue anyone who aids or abets an abortion (including ride-sharing drives) after six weeks of pregnancy. Both companies recently extended the same coverage to drivers in Oklahoma.

Lyft also previously pledged to donate $1 million to Planned Parenthood. ""We've made our perspective on this quite clear"" Lyft co-founder and President John Zimmer told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday after the leak. ""So we will continue to look for ways to make a difference to speak out and to most importantly take action.""

UTA: 'The right to choose … has been a bedrock'

Hollywood's United Talent Agency also responded to the draft ruling by notifying its employees it would reimburse travel expenses related to reproductive health services unable to be accessed within their state. ""We're doing this to support the right to choose that has been a bedrock of settled law for almost half a century"" CEO Jeremy Zimmer said in a memo to employees. ""Several states have already introduced restrictive legislation and the draft Supreme Court ruling leaked yesterday if it comes to pass could make abortion illegal in more than half of the country.""

Yelp: 'Turning back the clock … will have a seismic impact'

Online review website Yelp has been outspoken in its opposition to an overruling of Roe warning such a decision from the court would have a ""seismic impact on our society and economy.""

""Turning back the clock on the progress women have made over the past 50 years will have a seismic impact on our society and economy"" Yelp continued in its statement on the matter. ""This goes against the will of the vast majority of Americans who agree that decisions around reproductive care should be made by women and their doctors."" The company also called on Congress to codify Roe into law.

Prior to the Monday evening leak Yelp had announced it would be covering expenses for employees and their spouses who must travel out of state for abortion care. The policy arrived in response to a restrictive six-week ban out of Texas but the benefit extends to employees in other states as well. Mirian Warren the company's chief diversity officer has said Yelp is not concerned about backlash.

Per a Wednesday report from The New York Times businesses who appear yet to directly comment on the draft ruling include PricewaterhouseCoopers Oracle JP Morgan Chase Walmart Disney ThirdLove Patagonia Kroger and Meta (though Sheryl Sandberg did post on Facebook writing that ""this is a scary day for women all across our country"").

Esparza became a two-time strawweight champion after winning a split decision against Rose Namajunas on Saturday at Footprint Center in Phoenix. The fight was mostly dull with both women hesitant to engage over the course of 25 minutes. In the end Esparza did enough to win the rematch by scores of 47-48 49-46 and 48-47 much to the chagrin of Namajunas.

The fight was so lackluster that UFC president Dana White said he was “zoning out” halfway through.

Andrade was more blunt in her assessment calling the Esparza-Namajunas fight “the worst in strawweight history.”

Andrade a former UFC strawweight champ returned to the division two weeks ago after a three-fight stint at flyweight that included a title-fight loss to Valentina Shevchenko. After her historic standing arm-triangle submission of Amanda Lemos at UFC Fight Night 205 Andrade made it clear she’s on a quest to reclaim 115-pound gold.

Andrade reentered the official UFC strawweight rankings at No. 5 after defeating Lemos. It might be too soon for her to get a title shot as White said after UFC 274 that next month’s UFC 275 rematch between ex-champs Joanna Jedrzejczyk and Zhang Weili could be a No. 1 contender fight."

They dominated pro No-Gi Jiu Jitsu throughout most of the 2010s and won every major No-Gi title multiple times.

DDS seemed prime to dominate the sport for another decade but then the team abruptly broke up. Here is the complete story of the Danaher Death Squad.

Detailing their rise dominating sport Jiu Jitsu to breaking up and the members going on to form their own teams.

John Danaher

To detail the full history of the Danaher Death Squad you have to start with the team’s coach. The mastermind John Danaher.

Danaher is a native of New Zealand that moved to New York in the 1990s to attend grad school. While attending Columbia University studying for his PhD in philosophy John would work as a bouncer at a nightclub.

One of his co-workers invited him to come train Jiu Jitsu with him at Renzo Gracie’s academy. He was skeptical of Jiu Jitsu at first but once he began training Danaher saw it was beneficial to learn.

John would train alongside the likes of Matt Serra and Ricardo Almeida and became one of Renzo’s top students. Since a catastrophic leg injury prevented Danaher from competing he invested his time becoming the best coach he could be.

His methodical approach would help him become one of the most respected coaches in all of Jiu Jitsu and MMA.

The formation of DDS

In 2011 Danaher took over one of the morning classes in the blue basement at Renzo’s school. Around the same time he started teaching this class Eddie Cummings had just started training at Renzo’s school.

Cummings liked Danaher’s approach to Jiu Jitsu and would attend all of his morning classes. John would also begin teaching Eddie his infamous leg lock system that the team would become known for.

Garry Tonon

A short time after Eddie began learning from Danaher Garry Tonon would begin taking his classes. He would make the trip to New York with his instructor Tom DeBlass multiple times every month.

Garry would become one of Danaher’s pupils and his game would improve drastically under John. He would win the No-Gi World Championship at brown belt two times before competing at ADCC.

There he would have his epic match with Kron Gracie that many consider the greatest match of all time.

EBI

Eddie Cummings and Garry Tonon would compete at the early Eddie Bravo Invitationals. At these events they would wipe out the competition.

Winning multiple tournaments using Danaher’s patented leg lock system. Even though the two were dominating the pro No-Gi circuit this would just be the beginning.

Tonon would continually tell people the best was yet to come.

Gordon Ryan’s debut

Garry’s statement would be a prophetic one as his teammate and best friend Gordon Ryan would make his EBI debut. Just like his teammates Ryan would dominate the higher weight classes and win multiple EBI titles.

Danaher’s students had begun their takeover of the sport.

Who came up with the team Danaher Death Squad?

The person that is credited with coming up with the Danaher Death Squad name is their former teammate Ryan Quinn. He posted it on Reddit one day in 2016 describing what it was like to train with them.

The name caught on and everyone within the Jiu Jitsu world would begin calling the group the Danaher Death Squad.

Notable DDS members

The Danaher Death Squad consisted of some of the best No-Gi grapplers in the world. Here is a list of the most notable members.

Eddie Cummings

Eddie Cummings was one of the original members of the Danaher Death Squad along with Garry Tonon. He would go on to win two EBI tournament titles and one of the early Polaris super fights.

Cummings would have a falling out with the team and leave to coach at another school in New York. To this day Eddie and the other DDS members are still not on the best of terms.

Garry Tonon

Garry Tonon was one of the original DDS members and one of the most prominent members of the group. He would win 4 EBI championships which really made the squad’s presence known in the Jiu Jitsu world.

Tonon has now transitioned to MMA and currently has a 6-1 record and is currently signed with One FC.

Gordon Ryan

“King” Gordon Ryan is considered to be one the great Jiu Jitsu athletes of all time. At just 26 years old Ryan is one of the most decorated athletes in the history of the sport.

Winning 3 ADCC championships 2 No-Gi world titles and 4 EBI tournaments. Gordon will most likely be considered the greatest of all time once he calls it a career.

Nicky Ryan

Gordon’s younger brother Nicky Ryan made waves in the sport as a young prodigy. Beating numerous world champions all before he turned 18. Nicky no longer lives in his brother’s shadow and has carved his own path within Jiu Jitsu.

Nicky Rodriguez

Nicky Rod took the Jiu Jitsu world by storm in 2019 at that year’s ADCC championship. He had barely been training Jiu Jitsu for a year and took second at the tournament and beat two former champions. As Rodriguez develops his game many expect great things from this special athlete.

Craig Jones

Craig Jones was one of the last big name members of the Danaher Death Squad. After competing against them for a few years Jones decided to settle in the US and join them. He was already considered one of the best Jiu Jitsu athletes in the world but elevated his game training with DDS.

Jake Shields

Jake Shields the former Strikeforce champion and UFC vet started training with DDS late into his career. Shields made the transition to compete in pro grappling and chose to train with the Danaher Death Squad. He still competes frequently in pro Jiu Jitsu events throughout the world.

DDS goes to Puerto Rico

In 2020 the Jiu Jitsu world was shocked to learn that the Danaher Death Squad was leaving Renzo’s school. They decided to part ways and leave the famed blue basement to start their own school.

DDS wanted to make a training hub where the best athletes from all over the world would come train with them. The place they decided to open their school was on the tropical island of Puerto Rico.

The idea was that putting their gym within a tropical paradise would help attract more athletes to train with them.

The Danaher Death Squad breaks up

After just a few months the DDS project in Puerto Rico would come to an end. A lot of unfortunate events would lead to the termination of the project.

Everything from the Covid-19 outbreak and the death of Gordon and Nicky’s beloved father Gordon Sr. It was also difficult for people to travel to the island due to Covid which really hurt the gym.

Gordon Ryan would announce on Instagram that he was moving to Austin to start a new gym. John Danaher would then follow up with a post of his own announcing that the Danaher Death Squad was parting ways.

While they were in Puerto Rico there were some conflicts between members of the team that were reported. Things such as differences in training philosophies and the failure of the new school caused some friction.

After meeting together the team decided the best thing for everyone to do was go their own ways. With that the era of the Danaher Death Squad dominating the Jiu Jitsu world was over.

New Wave Jiu Jitsu & The B Team

From the break up there would be two new teams formed that are ironically enough both in Austin Texas. John Danaher Gordon Ryan and Garry Tonon would go on to form their team New Wave Jiu Jitsu.

Then other members consisting of Nicky Ryan Ethan Crelenstin Craig Jones and Nicky Rod would form the B Team. A name that is a bit of a joke since they were considered the B team of the Danaher Death Squad.

The two schools are actually only a less than 15 minute drive from one another. Although neither team interacts with the other and have no plans on doing anything together.

ADCC 2022

At this year’s ADCC championship event both Gordon Ryan and Nick Rodriguez are in the same division. We could very well see a match of two former DDS members take place at the event. We might even see former DDS teammates compete against each other in the absolute division.

The Legacy of the Danaher Death Squad

During their time the Danaher Death Squad were the most dominant team of their era. Members of DDS won multiple major titles and helped put more eyes on pro grappling. They will forever be known as one of the greatest Jiu Jitsu teams that had ever been assembled.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL3VrLWVuZ2xhbmQtZXNzZXgtNjEzNDk1ODfSAThodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY28udWsvbmV3cy91ay1lbmdsYW5kLWVzc2V4LTYxMzQ5NTg3LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Braintree: RSPCA's Danaher Animal Home warns of waiting list,"""There were a lot of animals bought during that time because it was the right time for everyone"" she said.",,,,,,,,,

Miller

Special to the Columbus Dispatch

My daughters grew up playing a video game called Tetris and we recently used the skills they learned from that game to build a wall.

The Wikipedia definition of the game is this: “In Tetris players complete lines by moving differently shaped pieces (tetrominoes) which descend onto the playing field. The completed lines disappear and grant the player points and the player can proceed to fill the vacated spaces. The game ends when the playing field is filled.”

Two weeks ago Daughter No. 3 and I played Tetris with 200-pound sandstone blocks.

I should say that she played Tetris. I followed her directions and helped find lift and carry — with the help of John Deere — the stones we needed to build a retaining wall at the entrance to our family farm.

It was in a sense a final Mother’s Day gift to my stepmom who talked before her death by cancer two years ago about how nice the entrance would look with a retaining wall.

My dad had similar thoughts but for different reasons. He wanted a wall to help hold soil around the mighty oak tree next to the driveway. He calls it the Indian Tree because it is one of the many oaks that Native Americans bent over and tied down with a leather thong to show the direction of a particular path.

The tree was among the earliest Ohio road signs. It marked the trail. It showed the way. It pointed toward the next stop on the path.

And it is very big and very old. Dad says 200 years. Maybe older.

Seeking to preserve the oak tree

My daughter lives in the shadow of that tree. She watches and listens to the red-winged blackbirds the piliated woodpeckers the blue birds the hawks and the American bald eagles that fly through or above its majestic crown. She wants to make sure it is there for generations to come.

So she said that we needed to build the wall that her Grandma and Grandpa had talked about. And we needed to get it done before Grandpa got back to Ohio after his winter trip to Arizona.

He had told us he’d be home the first week of May. I told my daughter that we better count on him returning a week earlier because it’s spring in Ohio and no one who had experienced the beauty of this place at this time of year wants to miss it. And plus the wedding of our Amish neighbor’s daughter was April 27 and I couldn’t imagine him missing that.

So we raced.

We raced as quickly as a 62-year-old man and a 32-year-old woman can race while carrying 200-pound rocks.

We worked from a pile of stones that has been sitting in the corner of our pasture for 35 years. They had been the foundation stones put in place by my great-great-grandfather when he built the barn on our farm. When my dad hired a crew to levitate the barn and put a new foundation under it to save it from sliding down a significant slope they unceremoniously hauled the stones to a corner of the pasture and dumped them in a heap.

Storm doors:Old House Handyman: Shopping for new storm doors a perfect way to spend a winter's day

It's no small thing to paw through a pile of sandstones each the size of a concrete block or two — but solid.

And we had to find just the right ones.

Finding the right stones to use

My daughter had done her research. She had read up on the best ways to build a dry (no mortar) sandstone wall. She had watched YouTube videos. She knew what she was looking for.

So we looked and she rejected a lot of stones. Those she liked best often were beneath some other stones. Big ones. Heavy ones.

I did not complain (too much). I bent my 62-year-old legs to save my back — and I employed an ample pry bar — and I worked with her to lift and roll and move perfectly good stones to get to just the right stones. And she was not wrong. They were right and good and they ended up making a very fine wall.

I was grateful that the temperatures were in the 40s on the first day of wall-building. Snakes don’t move much when it’s that chilly and I’m confident there are snakes in that pile of rocks. I know that poison ivy lives there. I ripped out plenty of it on the way to the perfect stones. I also still have a few spots of “poison” as my Grandma Miller matriarch of the family farm called that evil weed.

We loaded the perfect stones into the John Deere tractor’s bucket and hauled them to the Indian Tree. One by one trip after trip we assembled the pieces she needed to play Tetris. With 200-pound stones.

Garage door:Old House Handyman: Garage door project opens a portal to the past

A few were in the “wrong” place and required repositioning. I said little and let the Tetris master work her magic. I listened and lifted (and groaned in perfect “old-man” fashion) as we built the wall.

It rained and snowed rained and snowed and the sun shined brightly at times as we worked over a couple of weekends.

By the time Dad arrived home from Arizona the wall was done and my daughter had dumped loads of topsoil behind it in which she had started to plant ferns and flowers that will hold the soil tight around the Indian Tree.

Happy Mother’s Day Nola.

By March 27 193 vehicles had been reported stolen since the start of 2022 according to the Bellingham Police Department’s daily activity logs.

“During the same 86 days time frame in 2021 there were only 45” the log reads. By March 28 of 2022 this number increased to 195 reported stolen vehicles.

The Bellingham Police Department did not respond to The Front’s request to comment.

Fourth-year Western Washington University student Laura Raufi has experience with stolen vehicles. Her 1996 Honda Accord was stolen overnight in the winter of 2021 only six months after she got it.

“I was like ‘No. There’s no way my fears are actually true’ because usually I just get really overly anxious about that stuff” Raufi said. “I walked up and down my street like ten times and I was like ‘Nope my car is gone.’” Her car had been parked on High Street a place densely populated with Western students and where many cars have been reported stolen.

Raufi called the police and filed a police report soon after realizing it was stolen. Her car was found later that night in the parking lot of the Pizza Hut on Samish Way.

Along with car thefts certain parts of cars are commonly stolen as well and can be expensive to replace.

“When I turned it on it smelled like a John Deere lawnmower” said Zoe Johnson a recent Western graduate. Her catalytic converter had been stolen from under her car the night before.

“Catalytic converters pretty much scrubs your exhaust gasses so all your exhaust gasses have to go through this type of honeycomb” Seth Peterson a machinist at Specialty Metal Works in Blaine said. Peterson also used to work for Jiffy Lube and fixes cars recreationally. “Where the honeycomb is there's a bunch of precious metals that help react with the exhaust that helps clean it as it comes through.”

Replacing a car is expensive but buying a new catalytic converter also costs a lot of money because of the expensive metals that they contain Peterson said. Repairing a catalytic converter can cost anywhere from $900 to about $2500.

“I called seven different car places and honestly got the same feedback from all of them: that this has been really common” Johnson said. “That response that I got was ‘Oh another Toyota Prius there's been so many this month.’”

Johnson ultimately decided that filing an insurance claim would be the cheapest route to fixing her car.

There are many different methods perpetrators of auto theft take including; looking for easy opportunities actively searching force manipulation and master keys According to a study on car theft in the British Journal of Criminology.

To prevent catalytic converter theft protective shields are available. “It's expensive to install one of those. But if it prevents somebody from doing this type of thing it’s definitely worth it” Johnson said.

Car owners can protect their vehicles by installing preventive devices such as steering wheel locks. The most common lock is The Club designed to halt the steering wheel from moving.

“The primary method of preventing auto thefts in North America and Great Britain has been the reduction of opportunities for theft through target hardening” the British Journal of Criminology’s study said.

Target hardening refers to the preventative measures taken by car companies and car owners to make vehicles less susceptible to theft. Unfortunately target hardening from the driver’s end is hard to accomplish especially with older cars."

There are times when it’s nice to check out early and sit and watch planes but for most frequent travelers experience means efficiency and efficiency means spending as little time waiting around as possible.

There are deals to close beautiful hotel pools to enjoy and lovely fresh croissants to purchase most of which don’t take place at the airport.

After years of relaxed entry rules Delta is tightening current SkyClub lounge access rules to limit overstayers — and is rapidly launching exciting new ‘Delta One’ lounges to offer an even higher level of service to premium customers.

Delta’s New SkyClub Entry Limits

Delta has been trying to push lounges in premium directions in recent years with upgraded food and beverage options to match more refined spaces.

For those who travel regularly to Europe Asia or the Middle East it was easy to see that room for improvement in the US lounge market was aplenty and Delta has been working aggressively to fill that gap.

Delta now thinks another way to create a more premium lounge experience is to weed out excessive lounge behaviors. Lounge access after arrival is now over — and a new 3 hour time limit before flight will be in place for most passengers.

Beginning June 1 2022 guests will be able to access Clubs anytime within 3 hours of their scheduled departure time† (and connecting customers can continue to access Clubs at any time prior to departure). All departing and connecting customers will have access to Clubs. With the exception of arriving Delta One customers Club access will be unavailable for arriving customers without a connection†. Note that a same-day round-trip does not qualify as a connection. Customers will be able to access Clubs within 3 hours of their scheduled departure flight and within 3 hours of their return flight. Delta Airlines

After all these are airport lounges not WeWork spaces. Some Delta SkyClub members were rampantly abusing lounge access using lounges before flights but then also after arrival at their final destination to drink the night away rather than going out to bars.

If you have a connecting flight these limits don’t apply and Delta One passengers on international tickets also have exemptions as do top tier Delta360 members.

Delta is clearly trying to weed out certain passenger groups and behaviors to reduce crowding. Whether it works or not remains to be seen. Maybe some travelers won’t renew their memberships?

Delta Launching New Premium Customer Lounges

Delta SkyClubs will remain accessible for people who pay the yearly fee or hold select credit cards in addition to traveling on certain tickets. But for passengers who fly Delta One a new class of lounge is coming.

Delta will soon offer its own version of American’s Flagship Lounge or United’s Polaris Lounge concepts with Delta One Lounges. These premium airport lounges will not be available to Delta SkyClub members or people accessing the spaces with credit cards.

Only ticketed Delta One passengers or ultra-top tier status holders will likely be able to use these lounges. Accordingly significant refinement of amenities including top shelf drinks full meals and personalized service is expected.

""You are never really off duty; you are never really unguarded"" Sheriff Tommie Johnson III said Friday during a news conference.

Deputies Lynwood Smith and Bryan Cornelius said they had just finished dining at the Devon Energy Center when they were alerted by security to a man who had jumped over the turnstile and was heading toward the employee elevators. Authorities said the man whom The Oklahoman has chosen not to identify expressed an intent to commit suicide by jumping from the tower's top floor.

""We tried to engage him in dialogue and it became pretty clear that he was suffering from some sort of mental health crisis"" Smith said.

The deputies said the man refused to engage with them at all simply ""staring through them"" in a ""stoic"" manner. Smith said the man then darted for one of the elevators as they were waiting for additional deputies to arrive and Cornelius attempted to stop him.

The man struck Cornelius in the face and a struggle ensued. Smith said he was bitten and his Taser was ripped from his vest. Eventually with the help of Devon Energy security the man was handcuffed and detained.

The man passed out from what authorities identified as a drug overdose at the Oklahoma County jail and was revived with naloxone and taken to the hospital.

""In the jail he did disclose to me that he was suicidal and he did want to kill himself and he also repeated that while we were in the hospital"" Cornelius said. ""He was very adamant that he was going to commit suicide and I kept reassuring him that we weren't going to let that happen to him.""

Smith said deputies later learned the man's family had reported him missing to the Oklahoma City Police Department but did not know how long he had been missing.

""It shows a lot that he has people out there that love him that care about him and hopefully he gets the help that he needs and then gets back to his family"" Smith said.

Deputies said the man was charged in connection with the incident and it will be up to the district attorney's office to decide how to proceed on those charges.

The deputies said that the incident was another reminder during May which is Mental Health Awareness Month that responding to mental health calls is a part of their daily duties.

""It's not an uncommon thing for us to deal with it"" Smith said. ""It's an unfortunate thing.""

Johnson said it is important for all law enforcement officers to receive crisis intervention training so they can appropriately respond to mental health situations.

What does that money buy?,"Oil and gas companies put thousands of dollars every year into New Mexico’s political campaigns on both sides of the aisle seeking to influence policy to protect continued growth in the industry that represents about a third of the state’s budget.

That amounted to about $1.1 million in political contributions between Oct. 5 2021 and April 4 per a report from New Mexico Ethics Watch leading up to the 2022 Mid-term Election.

The latest chunk of change came in a year when New Mexicans could choose a new governor and the three top candidates in that race were the state’s biggest recipients of oil and gas’ dollars.

Mark Ronchetti a former weatherman seeking the GOP nomination for governor got the most with $300000 coming to his campaign from oil and gas during the latest six-month reporting period read the report followed by Republican State Rep. Rebecca Dow with $122000.

While Republicans are typically viewed as the party with more support for oil and gas Democrat incumbent Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham was the third-highest recipient of oil and gas money in the state the report read with about $60000.

That means gubernatorial candidates got about $500000 almost half of the $1.1 million provide by oil and gas as the industry sought a seat at the table in the race for New Mexico’s highest-ranking political office.

""The oil and gas industry plays an outsized role in the economic fortunes of New Mexico and we believe citizens need to be aware of the industry's continuing influence upon our public officials” said Ethics Watch Executive Director Kathleen Sabo.

Spokesperson for Lujan Grisham's campaign Kendall Witmer denied that campaign donations from the oil and gas industry impacted the governor's decision making touting Lujan Grisham's record on environmental policy and

""Governor Lujan Grisham’s commitment to New Mexico is evidenced by her tireless work to make New Mexico a leader in economic growth by supporting legacy industries and investing in new ones leading the nation in tackling climate and clean energy technologies and investing resources in local communities"" Witmer said.

""Campaign donations have no effect on policy and to imply otherwise is a disservice to the groundbreaking work made by the Governor local public officials industry leaders and communities.""

Overall about 70 percent of oil and gas contributions went to Republicans per the report compared with 60 percent paid to the party in 2020.

That money came from some of the biggest oil companies in the world records show as they focus on the prolific Permian Basin in the southeast corner of New Mexico amid global supply shortfalls on the heels of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and growing demand as the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to subside.

Chevron led with $71000 in campaign contributions between October 2021 and April 2022 followed Artesia-based Santo Petroleum with $66000.

Occidental Petroleum was third with $60413 in contributions the report read and ExxonMobil was fourth with $60000.

Other top contributions from the oil and gas industry were JR Water Transfer’s $50000 NextEra Energy Resources’ $41500 and $37850 from ConocoPhillips.

Another $36200 came from Devon Energy followed by $35800 from the Trust of John A. Yates founder of Yates Petroleum and Marathon Oil Company with $30000 per the report.

Political Action Committees associated with oil and gas contributed another $51000 to the state’s political campaigns per the report while receiving about $260000 from the industry.

About $135000 of that was donated the report read to the New Mexico House Republican Campaign Committee.

Oil county Republicans support oil and gas' role in state politics

State Sen. David Gallegos of Eunice along New Mexico’s eastern border to Texas in Lea County of the oil-rich Permian Basin region said the industry deserves the influence it pays for as a major driver of the state’s economy.

“They’re a large donor to the state as a whole. What we do to oil and gas hurts everyone” he said. “I think it’s fair. We determine the fate of their industry or their demise. They’re a major player in the room and they deserve a major seat in the room.”

Gallegos said he was concerned the industry’s backing of Democrat candidates might not get the return he said oil and gas hoped for.

“If you butter both sides of the bread someone’s hands get dirty” he said. “I think they (oil and gas) are trying to put an investment in to protect themselves. I don’t think it’s really worked. On the Republican side we know the value of oil and gas.”

Artesia State Rep. Jim Townsend of Eddy County also in the Permian pointed to economic prosperity and jobs created by oil and gas in New Mexico arguing it's interests should represented as they mirror those of many New Mexicans.

""You’re talking about an industry that provides almost half to the state gross domestic product. It is a significant industry"" Townsend said. ""Oil and gas is a significant employer. The jobs of representatives and employers are to represent their districts.

""We are very fortunate to live in an area that is blessed with bountiful resources. We don’t have anything else that back-fill that.""

Is oil and gas threatened by government policy?

Critics of the industry questioned if the value oil and gas brought into New Mexico’s economy would truly be harmed by recent policy decisions.

More:COVID-19 recovery meant more oil spills in New Mexico study says. What can the State do?

A report authored by New Mexico economist Kelly O’Donnell analyzed the impact recently proposed reforms on federal oil and gas policy would have on the state’ revenue.

When he took office in 2019 the administration of President Joe Biden placed a moratorium on new federal oil and gas leases nationwide as the Department of the Interior conducted a review of its fossil fuel programs.

In the years since the DOI implemented policy shifts to account more for environmental and climate change impacts of extraction on public land.

More:Oil and gas flowing from Permian Basin on heels of COVID-19 Russia-Ukraine conflict

About half of New Mexico’s oil and gas operations occur on federal land and industry leaders were widely critical of the federal policy as threatening the state’s economy and its role in the nation’s energy security.

But O’Donnell in the report argued such policy shifts would have no bearing on oil and gas prices which drive production and revenue to the state.

Most of the provisions only apply to new leases the report read and 90 percent of New Mexico’s federal leases or already in production meaning any changes were unlikely to impact present operations.

An increase of federal royalties companies pay on their operations from 12.5 percent to 16.67 percent O’Donnell said would also only apply to new leases and have a “negligible” effect on production costs.

“Congress and the Department of Interior are weighing a variety of reforms that could impact operators on federal land in New Mexico however my analysis shows these impacts would be minimal to state revenue” O’Donnell said.

“Despite claims by the industry and its allies these reforms will have no impact on gas prices and pose little threat to oil and gas production in New Mexico which is expected to continue rising in the coming decade.”

But beyond the handful of momentous events and prominent figures taught in schools the city’s past is actually filled with countless lesser-known tales and unsung heroes.

To bring attention to Hong Kong’s less prominent stories two history buffs Godfrey Lai Sin-hang and Haidee Or Hoi-yee founded a local history group We Toast HK six years ago.

Website preserves one of Hong Kong’s oldest public housing estates

“I was mainly taught the history of [mainland] China and the Western world – but not much about the city” said Lai a 29-year-old Chinese University history graduate.

Or who studied humanities at Baptist University also lamented how local history was neglected: “When we travel to another place we are always curious about the local history. But when it comes to Hong Kong why do we take its history and existence for granted?”

According to the 27-year-old the city’s history is everywhere if you pay attention to your surroundings. For example the replica plane hanging at the Hong Kong International Airport entrance commemorates the Spirit of Sha Tin which was the first-ever plane to fly in the city when it took to the air in 1911.

“We often see this plane model at the airport but we never think about the story behind it” Or said.

Over the years We Toast HK has published three books and numerous online articles covering topics such as food culture slang and everyday stories and they host history workshops for schools and the public. The group’s Facebook page has amassed more than 44700 followers.

Their readers often enjoyed discussing their life stories Or noted. Once a senior in his 70s read their article about Tai Po’s Greenville Amusement Park which opened in 1949 and closed in the 70s and he wanted to share about his visits to the park that now no longer exists.

“He told us he had been there as a kid and he even sent us a scan of his diary entry and a picture of him visiting the park. It was heart-warming” recalled Or.

To create We Toast HK’s content Lai and Or work with two other active members and two university student interns to conduct extensive research.

“When I read something interesting in a book I dig deeper into the topic and compile the information into an article” said Lai adding that the group’s writing was backed by primary or secondary sources.

Exploring Hong Kong history is full of surprises as sources sometimes contradict each other – showing the importance of thorough fact-checking.

When the group was writing an article about the City of Victoria – a name used during the colonial period to refer to Hong Kong Island’s northern coast – they found conflicting information about one of its districts Ha Wan.

Swinging from past to future – the evolution of Hong Kong play areas

Many official documents say Wan Chai is where Ha Wan was located but Or and Lai’s research revealed it was closer to Admiralty.

“We took half a year checking maps and tons of documents to figure out the truth” explained the historians.

After the group added this information to their Google Form quiz which launched in March some participants questioned why the answers were different from what they had seen in a museum. We Toast HK responded with supporting evidence and reminded their audience to cultivate a spirit of curiosity and a desire to find the truth.

“Even an authority and organisation could be wrong – don’t blindly trust them or rely on only one source” said Or.

Historian reveals the truth behind ghost stories on MTR’s Island line

In recent years the group has seen its reach extend beyond history buffs as current events have made Hongkongers want to learn more about their city.

After the mass protests in 2019 and the implementation of the national security law Lai said more people were asking fundamental questions about the city and its identity such as “How did Hong Kong become what it is today?” and “What does it mean to be a Hongkonger?”

To respond to these queries the group published 36 HongKongers Not Covered by Your History Textbook last year and another book this March Founding Hong Kong: 25 Modern Developments that Influence Your Lives.

“We are not aiming to provide [readers] with a model answer” Or explained. “Maybe everyone will come to different answers or there will never be a common answer. But what we have in common is that we have thought about these questions and grown together.”

The founders emphasised that understanding history should not be about memorising knowledge from a textbook but exploring what interests you and seeking the truth. It is important to learn slowly to develop a deeper relationship with the city and its stories.

“[Learning history] should not come from a sense of obligation but from a love for the place” the pair said.

Court records show Samantha Ann Carlson was ordered to serve three years in prison followed by three years probation on a charge of strong armed robbery as part of a plea agreement between the woman's lawyer and prosecutors. She has 461 days of credit time served while at the Marion County Jail according to court documents.

Carlson can't have any contact with the victim or victims of the incident and is forbidden from returning to any Dollar General stores.

Officials said the 31-year-old woman entered a no contest plea and was adjudicated guilty by Circuit Judge Peter Brigham on Tuesday. She was labeled a habitual felony offender.

In January 2021 Carlson told Marion County Sheriff's Office detectives she and her husband needed money to pay bills. She said she was unemployed and wanted ""to take some stress away from her husband"" her arrest report states adding she's addicted to crack cocaine.

Deputies said Carlson robbed the Dollar General at 16085 E. State Road 40. Employees thought Carlson had a gun and gave her cash.

When you think of Dollar Tree or any other dollar store you're probably thinking of purchasing bags of candy birthday supplies and maybe a few plain t-shirts for a relatively low cost. You can do some grocery shopping there of course since most of the foodstuffs the Dollar Tree sells are pre-packaged or frozen foods. While you may be getting a grocery order for cheap however sometimes it's pretty obvious that you get what you pay for — and not in a good way.

Now this isn't meant to say that Dollar Tree is a shifty business unloading junk onto an unsuspecting customer. Most Dollar Trees strive to be clean family-friendly and reputable places to purchase goods. Taste of Home for example suggests pasta frozen fruit coffee and bags of snacks as pretty safe buys for a low cost. But dollar stores for all their efforts to have a trustworthy reputation have had some poor publicity regarding this. Green America's expose revealed that a majority of products from dollar stores — such as Dollar Tree Dollar General and Family Dollar — contained one or more hazardous toxins. YouTube reviewer TheWolfePit also has multiple videos criticizing the low-quality processed foods sold at the Dollar Tree from ribs made of ""fake meat"" to chicken made from meat slurry.

It’s been a year since you left us Mother’s Day morning. I still hate that you’re gone just as much as I did this time last year. When we had to call the nurse. To tell her you had taken your last breath.

That hospital was so gray. I tried to make it more cheerful for you with photos of the kids. Bible verses on the mirror. Notes to your nurses making sure they knew you were a “warrior” who had beat cancer before. And the balloon arch. Sorry if I kept you up trying to figure out how to use that manual air pump from the dollar store. You know I’ve always struggled sitting still.

I’m still busy. Busy job. Busy family. I did take time off around the funeral. Dad and I made sure you had a nice casket. Casket shopping isn’t exactly like picking out a new dress. Oh and that was weird – picking out your clothes. Mom I had to provide underwear. Do you know how awkward it is to hand some funeral director your dead mother’s bra and panties? I offered options which apparently is not something you do because the seconds were handed back and I was just left there with Dad talking about your arrangements while holding your underwear.

You have to find reasons to laugh right? We always did.

Anyway I picked out that black leather-looking blazer with a black dress I liked. Remember I have a blazer that looks nearly identical and we showed up to dinner one night matching? Maybe that’s why I chose it. Another way to keep us connected.

We’ll always be connected I know but the past year hasn’t been the same. I’ve wanted to call you every day. I can’t. I’ve needed to vent to get advice to find inspiration to ask how to make your spelt waffles to ask you to come over. To tell you I miss you. Telling a therapist isn’t the same.

Ashley Judd:On my first Mother’s Day without my mama I want you to honor her legacy

I missed you at birthdays I felt overwhelmed planning. I missed you at Thanksgiving when I exploded a glass baking dish in the oven and Christmas when there wasn’t a tree at your house and Easter when you weren’t there to see the kids’ egg hunt. I missed you yesterday. I miss you today. I’ll miss you tomorrow.

The kids miss you. They ask about you and Heaven and have asked when they’ll see you again.

I hope there’s a window up there you can look through to see how much they’ve grown.

Dad misses you. I know I told you I’d take care of him but I’m not sure I’m doing a good job. We did convince him to go on that beach trip we had planned before you went into the hospital. We went around his birthday and it was good to be together. Then we came home and it was strange to fall back into a schedule. A drive to pick up the kids when I’d usually call you. A look at our text message thread full of photos back and forth punctuated by your replies (“Getting so big darling girl” / “Awww love him” / “Love you!”) is still there. Your number is still in my phone.

Columnist Connie Schultz:This is for single moms and the families they're building

Visiting the house is different. Dad has arranged everything very “practically.” All the plants are clustered around windows and that long side table in the family room is poking out into the sitting area so he can get to the window. He has photos of you everywhere.

Moving on is such a strange term. It seems like this moment when you pack away feelings about loss and go on with your life. But I don’t want to pack you away. I don’t want to forget you. I feel like I need to remember you now more than ever.

Columnist Rex Huppke:On a college visit with my son it hit me: He's leaving. He's ready. And I'm not.

I need to remember how you made motherhood look so easy. I need to remember how even when I would loudly disagree with you I never once doubted your unfailing love for me. And I never doubted my love for you.

Even though you’re missing this Mother’s Day you’re still my mom. You’re still teaching me.

You always will.

Miss you Mom.

Love

Ashley

Then she did the same for herself.,"Syrita Powers smiles outside of her new home before taking her kids to the playground in West Philadelphia on Thursday May 5 2022. Read more

Two months ago Syrita Powers was facing eviction unsure if she’d have to move her family — including three daughters with disabilities — into a homeless shelter.

On Thursday she sat in her new living room and shook her head in wonder. Exactly a week before Powers had signed a mountain of paperwork and received the keys to her very first home. She insisted her oldest 13-year-old Madison sit at the closing table with her because she wanted her daughter to witness what felt like a miracle.

“Every morning I wake up and pinch myself — this belongs to me” said Powers 43 motioning to the West Philadelphia rowhouse so bare it echoed and so full of promise she already has detailed plans for every room. “I feel like we hit the lottery.”

On Sunday Mother’s Day Powers will be recognized by an Olney church as a “mother who overcame” which feels like both honor and understatement.

“I feel like God has sent me to tell someone else ‘Please keep going’” Powers said. “People know if I did this they can definitely do it too.”

In 2015 Powers found herself in the stroke unit of Lankenau Hospital unable to lift her own arms. Her husband Aaron had just lost his job of 15 years. Their three girls had significant special needs and their son Aaron Jr. died a few hours after his premature birth. Powers thought she might need to use a wheelchair to get around and the question of where the family would live and how they would move forward plagued her. Powers used to work as a nursing assistant and her husband Aaron in a factory but their medical conditions and their kids’ needs precluded them from full-time work and so they rely on disability payments.

But Powers prides herself on being a “point of light” for others no matter the darkness of her own room. She pushed through physical therapy and figured out ways to cope with fibromyalgia and other medical conditions. She and her husband who struggles with kidney disease are a strong team caring for Madison Georgia 11 and Logan 9. (Maddie and Logan have autism; Georgia has intellectual disabilities. The younger two girls are nonverbal.)

The pandemic challenged the family; Georgia and Logan had especially regressed without access to in-person education for a full year. And the Powers family rental became untenable. A compromised roof rendered one bedroom unusable and a sewage leak ruined most of the family’s possessions and drew rodents.

The landlord refused to fix the issues Powers said; eventually the family put resources toward addressing the problem themselves which left them without rent. Public records show both multiple Licenses and Inspections violations against the landlord and an eviction order against the Powers family.

“Madison said to me ‘Mom we do not deserve to live in these conditions’” Powers said. “I said ‘God if you just get me over this threshold I’m going to make it.’”

Powers’ free time is typically devoted to two things: reading and helping people. She runs an online support group helping other parents of kids with special needs advocate for them passing along information about programs that help families with energy costs food and diapers. She had helped teach others how to buy homes but that felt impossible for her family.

But with their backs against the wall something clicked for Powers.

“I said to myself ‘Girl you can do that too’” Powers said. “I didn’t take all those classes to not become a homeowner.”

Powers fixed her credit. She took the Urban League of Philadelphia’s class for first-time home buyers. She got preapproved for a mortgage looked at 20 houses and bid on one where she sees her family living for decades a beauty with hardwood floors and walls painted gleaming white a finished basement three bedrooms two full bathrooms and a powder room.

“I’m very proud; I’m not bragging but we did this on less than $40000 a year” she said. It took careful budgeting. To show she could manage the house payments Powers had virtually no cash for 90 days. There was no money for extras or even school uniforms but the girls were always clean and no one missed a meal.

Powers matched a bright blue dress with pearls and high heels to wear at closing. When she turned the key on the house for the first time it was officially hers her mother shouted prayed sang and danced in the empty living room. Powers beamed and the girls raced around.

These days Powers has no car and the new house has exactly three pieces of furniture: two air mattresses and a lime green chair Georgia likes to sit in. They have a houseplant and some kitchen basics but there’s no washing machine or dryer; the budget doesn’t stretch to fit those yet. But Powers has a plan: Save six months of mortgage payments ($1431.36 per month a number Powers rattles off from memory) then buy furniture. The family will make do until then.

“I felt like I was failing at first because I can’t give the girls this perfect life” Powers said. “But you know what? We blow up balloons from the Dollar Tree every day. We play cards and we go outside. They’re happy. We’re happy.”

People on the block have smiled and introduced themselves. Maddie has designs on play dates in the basement; Logan loves the little backyard a concrete square where Powers envisions putting down fake grass. Georgia has already learned to climb the front steps herself thanks to a secure railing. She never managed that at the old house. Toilet training the younger two is more within reach now that the family doesn’t have to share a single bathroom.

The house has given Powers more room to dream. She sees herself as a business owner Madison in college. She wants to figure out a way to pay off the house in 10 years.

“It’s important for me to secure something for Georgia and Madison and Logan” Powers said. “We’ve had setbacks and shortcomings but we made up for it in the last lap. We defied gravity.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseWdhemV0dGUuY29tL25ld3MvZ2xlYW5pbmdzLWZyb20tdGhlLWNvcm4tZmxhdHMtdHJhY2luZy1uaXNrYXl1bmEtcy1ub3Rld29ydGh5LWJyb3duc2V5LWZhbWlseS9hcnRpY2xlX2VhMzY1ZGJmLWE3ZWUtNTI2Zi1hOWZhLWNjNzBhZWEwMTFhNy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GLEANINGS FROM THE CORN FLATS: Tracing Niskayuna's noteworthy Brownsey family,Success!

He was 13 years old.

“There have been a bunch of Bevos and white squirrels” wrote Patrick Parker one of Domino’s caretakers “But there is only one Domino.”

Domino was diagnosed with feline immunodeficiency virus and an upper respiratory disease in late 2021. After antibiotics failed to treat him a vet discovered a cancerous growth in his throat Parker said. Domino was moved from campus to a foster home where he lived until health complications caused him to have trouble eating. A vet visited his home to help him die peacefully Tuesday.

Nearly 100 people came to a memorial service hosted by the Cats of West Campus group on Wednesday. During the service the tower bells played songs such as “Amazing Grace” and “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.” Students faculty members and employees wrote messages on one of Domino’s two houses and left treats and flowers for him during the service.

“I loved seeing students interacting with him” said Renee Babcock who used to care for Domino. “We loved this silly little cat with the grumpy face. He was a real rock star.”

Babcock an academic advising coordinator noticed a black-and-white cat claiming the West Mall as his own in 2009. Although initially timid Domino grew into a spunky personality that earned him the love of the UT community. For 10 years Domino greeted Babcock each morning.

After his arrival the tuxedo cat’s popularity skyrocketed partially due to a Reddit post that received nearly 80000 upvotes in 2019. Following this The Daily Texan made a video about him and since then he’s gotten his own social media pages been a part of graduation photos and had multiple articles written about him. But more importantly “The King of Campus” as he was nicknamed was a friend to many in the UT community.

“I feel like I’ve lost one of my own cats” Babcock said. “I think there was something about his presence that we all counted on.”

University employees formed the Domino Council to feed and care for him during his early days on campus.

Parker a research engineering/scientist associate said he would sometimes find Domino in West Campus around dinner time.

“We had this funny race to get to the FAC so he could be fed” Parker said. “It was so funny that we saw him so far away and he would recognize me.”

A petition calling for a Domino memorial statue has gained over 4200 signatures in the past two months with a spike in support after his death.

Parker said the best way to celebrate Domino’s life is to advocate for stray cats on campus.

Graduate student Muneeb Aslam said when he came to the University as an undergraduate in 2014 Domino reminded him of his cat back home.

“Domino approached me and it really made my day” Aslam said. “(Domino) showed me love and affection and it gave me a glimpse of what it felt like to be at home.”

Used to the bustling campus life Domino got lonely during the early days of the pandemic. He followed Parker around after being fed one night in 2020.

“He just kept following us” Parker said. “We’d go and he’d cry at us again. … That’s how I feel now. I just keep crying and crying and I’m not ready for him to leave us so soon.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vYXBwYWR2aWNlLmNvbS9hcHAvZG9taW5vLWdvLWRvbWlub2VzLWJvYXJkLWdhbWUvMTU3NDE1NjE2ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Domino Go: Dominoes Board Game by Beach Bum Ltd,"Come and play Domino Go!

“If you are West Indian you just can’t play dominoes without making a bit of noise” says Ernest Theophile 73 who has been playing dominoes cards and backgammon with his friends in Maida Hill market square in north London for 12 years.

He is unhappy about an injunction relating to behaviour in the square after Westminster council received 200 noise complaints. He argues it prohibited their board game revelry.

That order was tweaked last year but still those who breach it are threatened with jail if they are caught “playing loud amplified music drinking alcohol and shouting and swearing”. The council says they were never the target.

Still Theophile is fighting the order saying it amounts to “racial discrimination” against the board game players.

Inevitably the case is being portrayed as another “woke row” but any child of Caribbean origin who grew up in Britain will understand his insistence that dominoes played the West Indian way cannot be played quietly.

Growing up I remember huddles of men – including my dad uncles family friends –hunched over tables talking laughing and remonstrating loudly in smoke-filled rooms usually with a Red Stripe or Jamaican white rum in hand with reggae music blaring out of the speakers – and the dramatic thud of the dominoes as they crashed on to the table.

The banging down of the tiles would get louder and louder especially if a player was on a roll and looked like they were going to win. Sometimes there would be fallouts even near-punch-ups – dominoes is a serious thing in the Caribbean community. The game is still so popular in Jamaica that in 2010 the country expressed hopes of it becoming an Olympic sport.

My cousins and I would play and look on often wondering how long these games which could last for many hours would go on for. For me it meant seeing a more relaxed and fun side to my usually quite strict and serious father. It is one of the most enduring memories of my youth – as it probably is for a lot of Caribbean children who grew up in the UK.

The fact is this case is not about wokery or being deliberately antisocial – it is about cultural nuances. Dominoes is not played in Caribbean communities like chess or draughts – it is more like a very rambunctious game of Monopoly. It’s loud it has energy – it’s a social gathering as Theophile alluded to when he said he and his friends started playing in the square because “we were kind of lonely”.

If they make a bit of noise they are not the only ones. Football fans have their chants; pubs are noisy places; children playing outside wrenched away from their screens make a glorious racket.

No one has the right to be deliberately antisocial but isn’t reasonable accommodation of our different foibles how a diverse society works? Lighten up. Let the old men gather. Let the games begin.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3c2FudGFhbmEuY29tL3RoaXMtd2Vla3MtY29jaGluby1saXN0LWluY2x1ZGVzLWRvbWlub3MtcGl6emEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This week's Cochino List includes Domino's Pizza – New Santa Ana,"The O.C.

Reading up on Domino’s shopping guides is like having your own personal product concierge. We do the tedious part—deep-dive research hands-on testing and tapping experts for advice—so all you have to do is hit “add to cart.” That’s why we call them Simply the Best.

There is a universal truth among pool designers: The best in-ground pool slides are custom. But perhaps your budget is modest or maybe the house you bought during the pandemic came with a pool and no slide or you’re having regrets (womp) about not putting one in when you had the chance. With warmth and sun-filled days on the horizon—at least in the Northern Hemisphere—and your mini oasis in need of a little more playfulness it’s time to take the plunge.

And you’re in luck: We’ve given you a head start on the search. We tapped Brad Holley associate designer at Randy Angell Designs for tips on shopping for in-ground pool slides (for adults and kids alike!) from design and materials to safety features and more.

Our Favorites

Best Versatile: SRS Turbo Twister Pool Slide

Shop

Material: Roto-molded polyethylene | Weight capacity: 275 pounds | Design: Elephant leg corkscrew | Height: 8 feet 7 inches

What we like: Enclosed ladder

Molded-in handrails

Salt water–friendly Worth noting: Available in left or right curves

For in-ground residential pools only

Why we chose it: A space-conscious slide that lets you choose the direction of its curve.

Holley likes this brand’s reputation for its quality and reasonable price points. Compatible with in-ground pools only the slide’s sturdy construction (including a closed-in ladder to help with fall prevention) makes it safe for everyone regardless of daredevil status. Molded-in handrails make for easy slip-free gripping and an enclosed eight-step ladder makes climbing less like you’re scaling a slippery slope and more like a wobble-free casual walk-up. The flume measures more than 14 feet long so there’s plenty of runway for a big splash but the curved silhouette smartly takes up less deck or patio space. Use the pool’s return line or even a garden hose to run water down the slide (with a 25 gallons-per-minute [GPM] capacity at that). The slide is available in gray granite and sandstone two natural tones that keep it from leaning toward water-park vibes. A simple deck-mounted installation (that anchors the main section with steel studs) simplifies the process of assembling the slide; just make sure you have a couple of extra hands to give you an assist.

Best for Kids: FibroPool Slide

Shop

Material: Fiberglass stainless steel | Weight capacity: 200–275 pounds | Design: Straight | Height: 6 feet

What we like: Stainless steel weather-resistant hardware

Simple installation Worth noting: Curves right

Gel-coat surface

Only available in white

Why we chose it: This glimmering slide offers full-size fun with kiddos’ safety in mind.

While parents kick back on the deck and soak up the sun kids can get their share of splashes with this eye-catching slide. A gel-coat surface gives the luminous white fiberglass a glossy high-shine finish. And installation is supersimple: The slide comes with surface-mount hardware so all you have to do is drill holes in the appropriate spots screw the slide in place hook it up to your water hose—and voilà it’s ready. Accompanying anchors and pedestal feet offer added stability plus the steps are slip-resistant (clutch when wet feet will be running up it constantly). Oh and rust shouldn’t be an issue; the handrails are designed to withstand the weather so no need to worry if you occasionally forget to cover it at night.

Best Semi-Custom: Dolphin Slides

Material: Roto-molded polyethylene | Weight capacity: 275 pounds | Design: Elephant leg corkscrew | Height: 8 feet 7 inches

What we like: Enclosed or open flume

UV-protectant

Semi- and fully customizable Worth noting: Coated in fiberglass layers and 100 percent resin

Why we chose it: A selection of semi-customized slides made with resin for extra sturdiness.

Holley recommends this company due to its partial customization process: Slides are assembled based on the single or modular pieces you choose so there’s more that goes into it than just clicking “add to cart.” Out of the three options there is something for every type of pool-slide seeker: a simple single-piece water slide; a what-you-see-is-what-you-get slide; a predesigned model slide or a 100 percent custom-designed slide for those who want as many personalized specs as possible.

Best Add-Ons: Global Pool Tidal Wave Pool Slide

Shop

Material: Roto-molded polyethylene | Weight capacity: 275 pounds | Design: Straight leg | Height: 7–8 feet

What we like: Optional LED lighting

2 widths

Enclosed plumbing Worth noting: 3-year limited warranty

Limited color palette

Why we chose it: A sleek poolside pick that comes with a few stylish accessories.

Gliding down a poolside water slide sounds like our kind of fun but we also love that this particular model comes with optional LED lighting. You can choose from a couple of slide chute widths in the event that you prefer a little more space on your way down the flume which will be covered with water at 25 GPM. The enclosed plumbing design conceals the water connections making for a polished pool slide setup.

How We Chose These Products

Since custom in-ground pool slides tend to require a bigger budget we focused our search on reasonably priced semi-custom options that can be easily installed at home without professional help. Along with Holley’s suggestions and expertise we scoured the available offerings for the sturdiest of slides keeping in mind how well their designs cater to the safety of small children (re: enclosed ladders and easy-to-grip stair handles). We also zeroed in on the versatility of the materials—could they withstand saltwater pools or be easily wiped down with common household cleaners? The size was also an essential factor because the larger more extravagant slides shouldn’t have all the fun right? As for the design we searched for both open and enclosed and whether it could be moved or was more of a permanent fixture.

Our Shopping Checklist

Design and Materials

When it comes to the design of an in-ground pool slide consider materials durability height safety features slide type and how much poolside area it can safely take up. In-ground pool slides come in three categories: elephant leg (between 9 and 14 feet) which is generally the tallest type with a steep drop near the top making it more suitable for deeper pools; molded slide leg (8 feet high) which starts out straight and has a medium curve near the drop; and straight leg (between 8 and 12 feet) which is straight at the top and has a very slight curve at the bottom. In some cases your town or local homeowners association may have stipulations on slide height so check with them or government safety regulations before purchasing. Holley says how well your slide blends in (or doesn’t) with your poolside surroundings is a factor in whether you should consider custom or prefabricated.

“We will often try to come up with creative ways of screening like masonry or a stone wall” he says of the customization process. “This way all you’re seeing is the end of the wrapping around the wall or maybe popping through a little window.” If you purchase a prefab slide there likely will be less opportunity for creativity concealing it as the options are limited to the manufacturer’s specifications.

Prefabricated plastic slides and fiberglass options are extremely popular notes Holley although he advises paying close attention to the latter’s construction quality. “If those aren’t made really really well the resins can fade [over time] or even start to degrade out in the sunlight” he says. Solid plastics contain UV-resistant pigments and dyes which reduce the likelihood of fading from sun exposure and other forms of exterior wear and tear. “Since it’s just plastic through and through you’re not worried about the exterior layer wearing down to some dangerous or brittle material on the inside” he adds.

Installation

Most prefab slides come with detailed installation instructions that allow you (and a friend or two) to easily erect them on your own—in fact that’s one of their advantages. They are designed to be stand-alone positioned on the pool deck so placement and space allowances are tailored to each one. If you’re looking to purchase a custom slide there are fewer limitations on all fronts; however expect to call in the pros to do the job. “These slides can be built into hillsides or in a way that follows a yard that slopes downward” Holley explains. “Or some people with flat yards choose to build up creating a landscaped mountain with a slide attached.”

Safety

As Holley notes each slide comes with strict installation guidelines that ensure a safe setup. Before hitting “add to cart” you can also check with the Consumer Protection Safety Commission to make sure the slide you’re considering is in compliance with federal regulations.

Ask Domino

Q: What’s the average cost of a pool slide?

Depending on the size and whether you purchase it prefabricated or customized an in-ground pool slide can cost anywhere from $900 to $20000.

Q: How deep should an in-ground pool be for a slide?

A pool with an in-ground pool slide should be at least 3 to 4 feet deep but at certain points it depends on the drop or the distance between the end of the slide and the water. Holley recommends checking the manufacturer’s guidelines for each slide.

“The envelope that accompanies each slide tells you how much clearance you need for a person coming off of the slide” he explains. Different states and even cities may have different requirements on what that threshold is Holley adds so be sure to check the manufacturer’s instructions for related questions.

Q: How much deck space do I need for an in-ground pool slide?

Most slides need a minimum clearance of 7-by-15 feet but smaller ones may only require 5-by-5 feet. Check the manufacturer’s requirements for specific measurements.

Q: Can I use an aboveground slide for an in-ground pool?

Yes and there are even certain models that can float in the water if you don’t want to attach them to your deck. But because every pool slide has to meet federal safety standards make sure the model you like satisfies all the requirements.

The Last Word

There’s no doubt that an in-ground pool slide can liven up your outdoor chill spot. Make sure the slide you choose is best for your needs by considering the size materials durability stability customization options and price. But above all the best in-ground pool slide is a safe one. Let the splashy backyard bash begin!"

“Tony has been diagnosed with pneumonia but is in good spirits and is doing well. He was up walking around yesterday and his doctors think he should be able to return home within the week.”

Does Tony Dow have children?

Tony Dow tied the knot with Carol Marie Theresa Marlow on June 14 1969 and had a son Christopher Dow. However the pair divorced in 1980.

Christopher Dow has mostly gained recognition as the son of Tony Dow. The former does not have a Wikipedia page because of which details related to his early life and career remain unknown.

Born on March 26 1973 the 48-year-old is an actor. He appeared in a spin-off of Leave It to Beaver and The New Leave It to Beaver in 1985 making three appearances on the show.

He then portrayed a 1963 version of his father’s character Wally Cleaver in 1988 and played a 16-year-old Wally in 1989. He did not make any more appearances on the screen and has been inactive in the entertainment industry since 1991.

Christopher lost his mother’s 1971 Porsche in September 1991. According to reports he left the car in the ignition and forgot to put the top down owing to which the car was lost near Taft High School in Woodland Hills Los Angeles.

However Dow found a 16-year-old kid pushing the Porsche down the street the next day. He kept the kid in a headlock until the cops arrived at the site. While Tony agreed with his son's actions he added that he personally or his on-screen character might have acted differently.

Christopher has not revealed much about his personal life and prefers to stay away from the limelight.

Pensacola News Journal

The citizens of Pensacola strongly support the pledge from NAS Pensacola Commander Capt. Terrence Shashaty to reopen public access to the base and its world-class historic sites and National Naval Aviation Museum.

The base has been closed to the public ever since the terrorist attack by a Saudi flight student on Dec. 6 2019. Despite the fact that the murderous attack did not come from civilians outside the base taxpayers local residents and hundreds of thousands of tourists have remained shut out from accessing the public assets. It's unnecessary unproductive and harmful for the economy tourism and local quality of life.

Along with Pensacola Beach and the renaissance of downtown Pensacola the museum lighthouse and historic sites at NAS Pensacola complete the crown jewels for a tourism experience unlike anywhere else in Florida or the U.S. Visits to the base were treasured by visitors and locals alike before access become locked off.

And:NAS Pensacola FDOT partnering on public access road to Barrancas Cemetery Aviation Museum

Local leaders and base officials have all spoken out for the need to reopen the base. It's time for leaders at the federal level including President Joe Biden Florida Senators Marco Rubio and Rick Scott and Congressman Matt Gaetz to focus on Pensacola for a moment and expedite the process of restoring public access.

If quality of life in the Cradle of Aviation isn't enough of an argument the sheer impact on the economy should open politicians' eyes. The closure of NAS Pensacola to the public is responsible for the loss of 342 jobs and $11 million in labor income.

The National Naval Aviation Museum is the second largest aviation museum in the nation and a top 10 attraction in Florida. Tens of millions of citizens from across the country have made the journey to the 350000-square-foot museum that features 150 fully restored military aircraft thousands of artifacts and an Apollo 11 moon landing virtual reality simulator.

That immersive world-class museum experience came to a crashing halt on Dec. 6 2019.

Pensacola area industry sectors lost an estimated $31.5 in gross sales between 2019 and 2020 alone due to the enhanced security measures at NAS Pensacola. Hotels and motels lost nearly $10.6 million restaurants are estimated to have lost $5.2 million.

PNJ reporter Jim Little explained there is a long-term solution in the works that involves the Florida Department of Transportation taking ownership of a road through the base and reconfiguring the base's security perimeter around it. But that solution is years away.

Capt. Shashaty said that base officials are looking for a short-term solution but that it will require a decision from the Department of the Navy in Washington. It surely comes as no surprise to our local veterans that action from the federal military bureaucracy would potentially pose a major delay to an otherwise straightforward reopening.

Shashaty also said that as of now the official plan is for NAS Pensacola to host the Blue Angels Homecoming Air Show in November. Although he acknowledged that specific solutions for public access are still up in the air.

With all the time our federal elected officials waste tweeting talking to donors and posing for television cameras it seems like a small thing to ask that they take some time away from the nonsense to simply expedite a solution that would mean so much to local citizens here in Northwest Florida.

The closure of NAS Pensacola is a perfect opportunity for these politicians to use their access in Washington to accomplish something tangible for this community and every taxpayer who comes to visit Pensacola.

There's no reason why this can't happen. But local civilian and military leaders need a shortcut through federal red tape. Biden Rubio Scott or Gaetz should find the time to stop yapping put in the work and make the reopening happen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wbmouY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvZXNjYW1iaWEtY291bnR5LzIwMjIvMDUvMDgvZXNjYW1iaWEtY291bnR5cy1ncmFuZHZpZXctZmxvcmlzdC1tYXJrcy0xMDAteWVhcnMtZmxvd2Vycy85NjMxODk2MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Escambia County's Grandview Florist marks 100 years of flowers,"Bright mums pink Gerber daises white hydrangeas green stems sprouting half-bloomed yellow gladioli and much more than just a lily or two line the walls of Grandview Florist.

For the last century the storied flower shop has been selling Escambia County residents flowers to give to the most important people in their lives.

As one of the greater Pensacola area's oldest and longest continually operating local businesses Grandview Florist celebrated its 100-year anniversary earlier this month.

This weekend's Mother's Day will mark the 100th in a row that the small flower shop currently located north of Pensacola in the small community of Gonzalez has sold its flowers to hopeful gift givers.

""We're doing well"" said Carolyn Brewton. ""We're still doing real well.""

Roots of Grandview Florist in Florida

Brewton 78 of Gonzalez is the current and latest member of her family to own and operate Grandview Florist.

Her grandmother Elizabeth Krebs originally opened the Florida-based iteration of the flower business May 1 1922 and ownership has stayed in the family ever since.

Before then Krebs lived in Dayton Ohio. She moved out of the state after a divorce from her second husband.

""Grandma was a very smart lady"" Brewton said. ""But she had a poor choice in men. Very very very smart businesswise and could grow anything — anything. But she was not good with men.""

The family legend is Krebs' decision to move to Pensacola was based on seeing an advertisement for Florida in an Ohio magazine.

Regardless of the reason behind her choice when Krebs did move to the Gulf Coast she brought her two daughters and already well-established Dayton flower business with her.

""We assume it'd been in Dayton for about 40 years prior to the move. But we don't know because the courthouse burned and everybody has passed"" Brewton said. ""So we can't say that we are 140. We can only truly say that we're 100.""

Business blossoms over the decades

The business was originally situated on Old Palafox Street. Over the years it switched locations to Pauline Street in Gonzalez and then to its current address at 1370 South U.S. 29 where it's remained for the last 60 years.

The original name wasn't Grandview Florist but Grandview Gardens because florists use to grow their own flowers.

Krebs purchased 104 acres of land when she arrived in Escambia County and built vast greenhouses in which she grew her shop's flowers. She also planted fruit trees on the property.

At one time Krebs even had enough homegrown plants to act as a type of wholesaler sending bushels of cut flowers back to Ohio for her old contacts to sell in their own stores.

""There was a post office down here and we us kids use to take them and go down there and watch them put them on the train"" Brewton recalled about her grandma's flowers.

The out-of-town letters packages Krebs' packed flowers and any and all other cargo would be gently tossed onto the slow rolling train.

""It just had an open thing and they just threw it on. That's when I was little. That's a long time ago. But oh if he ever missed one"" Brewton remembered about the post office worker. ""Oh that was wonderful if he missed getting it on there.""

Brewton cherishes an old black-and-white photograph of herself at age 4 working in her grandmother's garden. The old snapshot is worn and on the back it's dated Jan. 22 1948.

""They would cut the hoe and shovel handles off so I could use them because I was short. I was little"" Brewton said. ""So I've been at it 74 years.""

'It definitely has a legacy to it'

Eventually the florist industry changed. It became more cost-efficient for local businesses like Grandview Florist to purchase their products instead of cultivating them.

But despite how the industry has changed over the last century the little flower shop in Gonzalez is a solid profitable business with a dedicated staff.

Rick Brooks started working at Grandview Florist 35 years ago.

""I was a delivery driver when I started and then one thing just kind of led to another"" Brooks said Wednesday while unpacking new merchandise in preparation for crafting a flower arraignment.

The store's other longtime employees include Kathy Elliott Jean Huff and Mary Robbins.

""It definitely has a legacy to it"" Robbins said of the business.

Brewton said the shop's customers were key in helping the business survive during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Our customers bought everything they could from us"" Brewton said. ""All my employees I had to cut hours a little bit and they stayed with me. And that was the last couple years but even then we were able to stay afloat.""

Henry Arnold walked into Grandview Florist just as Brooks was about to begin work on his newest flower arraignment.

Arnold the pastor of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church has been purchasing flowers for both his church and his own personal purposes from Grandview Florist for at least the past 25 years.

""They're great. They're the best"" he said later adding ""They do wreathes and everything for death and I like to use them for myself personally.""

Another longtime costumer Laura Cook said the florist was a special place.

""They've done a lot of proms and funerals and Mother's Days and a lot for the community"" Cook said. ""They consider what the customer wants and have tried their best over the years to keep their prices down as best as they could.

""They are just a really loving group of people there that know what their business means for the community.""

Kristen DiMera (Stacey Haiduk) drugged and kidnapped her the night before she was to marry Xander Cook (Paul Tefler) transporting the young woman in a chest halfway around the world. Sarah went willingly at the time because of the drug that she had been given but she was almost childlike. Once Kristen got Sarah to the island Sarah slowly began to improve. But Kristen couldn’t take Sarah home or she would be charged with kidnapping on top of her other crimes.

Days of Our Lives Spoilers – The Diary Of Renee DuMonde!

Since Kristen still had unfinished business in Salem she gave Sarah something to read to pass the time. The book she selected was the diary of Renee DuMonde (the late Philece Sampler). Somehow the combination of the drugs and her isolation caused Sarah to believe she actually was Renee. Renee was murdered decades ago but the was Stefano DiMera’s (the late Joe Mascolo) oldest daughter. She was in love with Tony DiMera (Thaao Penghlis) at the time of her death so when Sarah saw Tony she jumped in his arms believing her true love had come to rescue her. As viewers know Tony is married to Anna DiMera (LeAnn Hunley). Renee’s sworn enemy.

DOOL Spoilers – Dr. Wilhelm Rolf Created An Antidote!

Eventually Sarah returned to Salem with Tony. She still believed she was Renee which broke Xander’s heart. The drug that caused Sarah’s delusions was created by Dr. Wilhelm Rolf (William Utay). Rolf agreed to create an antidote and gave it to Chad DiMera (Billy Flynn). The drug was tested and deemed to be safe. But a jealous Gwen Rizczech (Emily O’Brien) swapped the antidote for another dose of the drug. Anna took it upon herself to inject Sarah thinking it was the cure. After the drug made its way through her system Sarah no longer believed she was someone else. Unfortunately she believed she was a young child with no memory of her adult life.

Days Of Our Lives Spoilers – Sarah Horton Will Get The Real Antidote!

Since Sarah had never been given the antidote Xander realized that it could still work. He convinced Gwen to tell him where the drug was located and soon Sarah will be given the antidote! And at first it will seem to have worked like a charm. Sarah will remember Xander and even kiss him. But soon Xander will realize all of Sarah memories haven’t returned and she still believes that she and Eric Brady (Greg Vaughn) are parents. But the baby that Sarah believed to be hers was actually Kristen’s little girl. Xander and Victor Kiriakis (John Aniston) switched Sarah’s baby who died right after childbirth with Kristen’s. Sarah won’t remember any of this and Xander won’t want to tell her for fear it will cause a setback. Xander and Sarah finally made their way back to each other but now it seems as though Sarah will have to relive that nightmare and this time; she may not forgive Xander so easily!

DOOL Spoilers – What Do You Think?

Will the antidote work on Sarah? Could she finally be herself again? Or will she and Xander have to relive their worst nightmare?

The answer lies in the past,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.

New York CNN Business —

The Federal Reserve’s favorite inflation-related adjective used to be transitory as in: Inflation is transitory and price increases should be temporary.

That is no longer the case. Inflation rates have been increasing sharply since August 2021 and have been out of the normal 2%-to-4% range for a full year. The Consumer Price Index rose 8.5% for the year ending in March a rate that hadn’t been seen since December of 1981.

So the central bank has broken up with “transitory” and set its eyes on a new inflation-modifying term: entrenched.

“It’s our job to make sure that inflation of that unpleasant high nature doesn’t get entrenched in the economy” said Fed Chair Jerome Powell last Wednesday just after he announced a half-point interest rate hike to combat inflation.

It’s unclear what exactly entrenched inflation looks like or how we’ll know if we’ve reached it. The Fed has given very little guidance in general on how long they predict it will take for their interest hikes to lower inflation. “It’s a very difficult environment to try to give forward guidance 60 90 days in advance” said Powell last week. “There are just so many things that can happen in the economy and around the world.”

There’s nothing investors hate more than uncertainty and as increasing rates pummel US markets they want more guidance. Americans who have been hard-hit by rising gas and food prices also want to know when they can finally feel some relief especially if the Fed’s rate hikes risk dragging the economy into a recession.

Looking back: Looking to the past could offer some insight: Although prices have been relatively stable over the past four decades large swings were not uncommon before the early 1980s.

History (and Fed data) show that the driver of inflation is important in predicting when rates will finally decrease: Prices grew at very rapid rates during World War I and World War II as a result of war-time constraints but fell again when peacetime resumed.

In the 1970s the US experienced its longest stretch of heightened inflation. President Richard Nixon removed the dollar from the gold standard and two surges in oil prices pushed inflation rates to 12.3% by late 1974. The Fed began practicing “stop-go” monetary policy raising benchmark rates as high as 16% and then quickly dropped them again leading to a cycle in which increased interest rates weren’t sustained for long enough to end inflation or increase growth.

By the late 1970s Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker took over and ended that policy. He raised rates and kept them high until inflation came down throwing the US into recession (its second of the decade) but finally permanently lowering inflation rates where they remained for the next 40 years.

“I have tremendous admiration for [Volcker].” said Powell last week when asked about his policy changes. “He had the courage to do what he thought was the right thing.”

Looking ahead: So will it take nearly 20 years and two recessions to get us back to normal? Powell certainly doesn’t think so. The economy is strong and the unemployment data looks nothing like it did in the 1970s Powell said. Many believe that we’ve already reached an inflationary peak and numbers are beginning to flatten.

Analysts often speak of the fears of 1970s stagflation and compare our current situations but today’s inflation is caused by a mixture of global crisis supply chain disruptions and growth in consumer demand after Covid-lockdowns shut down the economy.

“The inflationary period after World War II is likely a better comparison for the current economic situation than the 1970s and suggests that inflation could quickly decline once supply chains are fully online and pent-up demand levels off” wrote the White House Council of Economic Advisers in a recent white paper.

Still as growth slows and markets drop the two S phrases — stagflation and sticky inflation — get thrown around with increasing frequency.

Some investors think the answer is in the middle.

“We expect US inflation to slow over the next two years but the progress will be very uneven” wrote Bank Of America analysts in a recent note. “There is tentative evidence of an easing of supply chain challenges and we expect ‘two steps forward one step back’ process in the next year.” But this won’t be a decade-long struggle they predict. Prices should begin to ease by 2023.

Is Google an oasis of green in the great tech wreck?

It’s been a bad few weeks for tech stocks but analysts are still keen on at least one name: Google parent company Alphabet (GOOGL).

Tech titans have fallen victim to rising rates and lackluster earnings this spring. PayPal Amazon Facebook parent company Meta Platforms and Netflix all took nasty spills in April and the Nasdaq had its worst month in nearly 14 years.

The forward-thinking tech sector is particularly vulnerable to higher rates: investors expect tech companies to post electric growth but inflation and higher interest payments will take a big bite out of those profits.

But not all companies will be hurt equally by the great tech wreck of 2022 say analysts. Many see Google as a green oasis in a desert of red.

“Google has withstood a few recessions already and held up pretty well” said Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler. “Typically the last thing advertisers cut is their Google spend.”

The numbers add up: Google Search growth remained solid at 24% in the first quarter and Google Cloud revenues increased 44% during the same period. YouTube advertising revenue fell below expectations as advertisers in Europe pulled back at the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but YouTube’s scale remains unmatched with over 2 billion monthly active users. More than a third of YouTube viewers are not reached by any other ad-supported streaming service.

Alphabet has a more stable business than its peers do wrote Bank of America analysts in a recent note. It also outperforms in artificial intelligence and machine learning products has significant expense flexibility and a management team that is doing more for shareholders than other companies are.

About those shareholder perks: Alphabet doesn’t mind scratching its shareholders’ backs the company repurchased $52 billion of shares over the last 12 months and the board has authorized the repurchase of an additional $70 billion.

Management also announced earlier this year that Alphabet stock will be split 20-for-1 in early July.

Cheaper shares mean smaller retail investors can flood into the stock further raising prices. More liquidity usually means more protection from extreme swings and a split signals to investors that a company is thriving and in demand by shareholders.

Kessler warned that Google isn’t immune to the headwinds harming other companies. “We do expect slower growth this year than we saw last year” he said.

But in the long run said Kessler “we think Google probably has the strongest fundamentals in large cap internet names.”

But when a group of 200 people settled down on the grass to enjoy sandwiches and slices of Victoria sponge next to the publicly funded woodland they were actually breaking the law.

This is because the Duke of Somerset owns much of the area’s woodlands and they remain largely off limits to the public because they are used for a large pheasant shoot.

The duke owns 1100 hectares (2800 acres) of land in some of the most beautiful areas of Devon but the vast majority of it is inaccessible to the public. This is despite the fact he has received funds for the woodland the protesters picnicked in under the English woodland grant scheme which comes from taxpayer money.

The Guardian joined protesters on Sunday as they walked for a few hours in the sunshine and had a quiet litter-free picnic in a field next to a conifer plantation. But by doing so those assembled were falling foul of trespass laws.

The group cheered as they passed a sign that said “no right of way” which indicated they were officially trespassing on the duke’s land.

This walk in the woods was illegal because there is no right to roam in England’s countryside. In Scotland visitors have a right to visit green spaces and it is agreed they should pass through respectfully and not leave a mess.

Harry a young Totnes resident and one of the organisers of the protest told those assembled: “We’re here for a peaceful demonstration ready to fight for a right to access the land. This not about a protest or a big march this is about a peaceful walk in the woods where we should all have access when it’s so important to our health and wellbeing. We want to be careful we want to be respectful and we will be litter-picking.”

Those on the protest made a point of picking up litter in the woods which are used chiefly for pheasant breeding and shooting. Plastic cartridges littered the floor and in a valley visible from the field where the protesters picnicked there was a “pheasant graveyard” with at least 100 bird carcasses dumped alongside an old washing machine and a pile of wire fence.

Sienna 25 an environment worker from Totnes said: “It just shows the excess these people don’t even eat them. They shoot them for fun and disrespectfully dump them.”

She moved to Totnes with her partner Ross 29 two years ago and the pair were here today on their first mass trespass. “There’s a lack of connectedness to nature” Sienna said adding: “More children know the names of Pokémon than they do wildlife species. We need to have access to the countryside so we can teach the next generation of environmentalists and have a wilder future.”

Ross added: “I think people need to be able to get in amongst the environment to tackle climate change. If they can’t get in it it will be a lot harder to show people what they need to protect. The duke of Somerset should open his land at least when there isn’t a shoot going on so people can experience nature.”

The law of trespass stops people from walking around freely. Last year the Treasury commissioned the Tory peer Theodore Agnew to lead a review into access to nature asking respondents for “radical joined-up thinking” to achieve a “quantum shift in how our society supports people to access and engage with the outdoors”. But as the Guardian recently revealed the review was quietly shelved and there are currently no plans to reveal the results to the public.

Totnesians involved in today’s event asked for more of England’s countryside to be made publicly accessible. Currently members of the public have a right to roam over just 8% of England; over the other 92% the law of trespass still applies.

Large swathes of private woodlands remain out of bounds to walkers with estate owners using them instead for releasing and shooting pheasants a non-native species of game bird. An estimated 50 million pheasants are released into the British countryside every year – equivalent in weight to the total biomass of wild birds in Britain.

The Devon locals shouted: “Less room for pheasants! More room for peasants!” as they entered the forbidden territory which was empty but for a couple of estate managers who kept a suspicious eye on the protesters.

Though they did not want to speak to the Guardian the estate managers seemed amused by the peaceful group who were chanting about pheasants as they strolled through the bluebell woods.

Guy Shrubsole is an author and one of the leading voices in the right to roam campaign who lives near Totnes.

On the march he said: “Regular access to nature is vital to people’s physical and mental health yet so much of England’s countryside is shut off behind fences and intimidating signs.

“Many woodlands – like those owned by the Duke – are off limits to the public because they’re brimming with pheasants put there for a few days’ shooting with hugely detrimental impacts on the environment.”

He said he had invited the duke to join the protesters but he did not receive a reply.

“We are a very non-confrontational event today. We reached out to him at his estate address and his House of Lords address. We wanted to say if you go down to the woods today you might be a bit surprised by the numbers there. But you’re also very welcome to come and join us for a picnic and have a discussion about perhaps negotiating better access in the future.”

The Duke of Somerset did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.

Frankie Gould another local resident involved in the event said: “Since our local group started trespassing last year we’ve visited many woods that are off limits to the public shut away behind barbed wire fences and ‘keep out’ signs.

“Yet the landowners of all the woods we’ve visited have benefited from publicly funded woodland grants. Public money but no public access – how is that right?

“The Forestry Commission and Woodland Trust give the public full access to their woods – why shouldn’t big private landowners do the same?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9mcmFua2xpbmNvdW50eS1uZXdzL25hbWUvbWFyay1tb3Nlcy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNDY1ODcxN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mark Moses Obituary (2022) - Port Saint Joe FL - Apalachicola Times,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/franklincounty-news/name/mark-moses-obituary?id=34658717 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9mcmFua2xpbmNvdW50eS1uZXdzL25hbWUvbWFyay1tb3Nlcy1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNDY1ODcxN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

Traditionalists out there won’t want to hear it but the view here approaching a half-century of covering the NHL is that the time has come to give the working help some relief — particularly in the early playoff rounds — and modify the league’s century-plus practice of overtime marathons.

The game ended at 11:48 p.m. some five hours from puck drop and the sides were back on Broadway Thursday less than 48 hours later for Game 2 (Rangers 5-2). The magic number stood at 15 for both when they squared off Saturday night in Pittsburgh for Game 3.

Anyone who cares to be honest about it and not buy into the kneejerk narrative that multiple OTs separates Stanley Cup play from the rest of the sports world will admit that quality of play falls off by about midway through the first OT. Bad only gets worse as the minutes pile up — the two partners left to drag each other around the floor like half-dead marathon dancers in the 1920s and ‘30s. Yowza.

Energy drains. Quality of play suffers. Ice conditions deteriorate. Risk of injury increases. Now there’s a gripping confluence of conditions.

But yeah tradition baby!

Starting Penguins goalie Casey DeSmith by the way left Game 1 at 9:18 of the second OT and will be out for the rest of the playoffs because of a core muscle surgery. DeSmith was named the starter because No. 1 Tristan Jarry was nursing a lower-body injury. It’s that time of year folks. These guys are beat.

“That’s what we want to see other teams going the distance playing way more than they have to beating each other up” Bruins forward Charlie Coyle said the next morning. “Overtime hockey is great in the playoffs but it takes a toll on you it does you wake up the next day sore and tired and then you’re back at it two days later.”

The captivating drama of it all well it’s just not there at least not in the first round with another 6-7 weeks to go before someone is left standing with win No. 16. And it’s not yet there in the second round.

Remember this to-infinity-and-beyond overtime meat grinder dates back decades to an era when it took only eight wins to clinch the Cup. Into the early ‘40s clubs played a 48-game regular season November through mid-March then faced the prospect of no more than 14 playoff games. Sixty-two games total.

In today’s 82-game regular season that begins in October game No. 62 brings clubs to the trade deadline usually in late February. The Cup winner in a typical season is crowned in mid-June — possibly in Game No. 110 if a team is stretched the full seven in all four rounds.

Now as unappealing as it can be to watch exhausted players make sloppy plays and goalies struggle to stand up after a save or the ice wear down to the point someone could be expected to yell “Car!” I’d leave the current system in place in Rounds 3 and 4. Even then though only for series-clinching games.

The NHL moved to the 16-win format in 1987 the mighty Edmonton Oilers the first to win four consecutive best-of-seven series. In ‘86 the Cup won that year by the Canadiens Round 1 was still a best-of-five.

For what it’s worth Penguins-Rangers on Tuesday was the 17th time since 1987 that a first-round game reached triple OT. Five of those reached into a fourth or fifth OT. Of the 16 games prior to this spring three of the clubs to participate went on win the Cup: Dallas (1999) Chicago (2015) and Tampa Bay (2020).

OK what to do as the alternative? Shootouts? Uh no they’re dreadful enough in the regular season.

Instead modeled loosely after the regular-season design begin OT games in Rounds 1 and 2 with the sides skating four on four. If it remains tied at the 70-minute mark mark (midway through the first OT) drop down another gear to three on three.

There remains the prospect games will still go to double and triple OT but it’s not a very realistic prospect. All that open ice should lead to quick and no less dramatic endings. Shootouts are a gimmick. But play at four on four and three on three remains part of the game and usually generates more fun and scoring chances.

In fact it’s possible the tension and entertainment factor will be even greater with skaters afforded more room to create plays as the ice opens up because of the change in manpower. Like the regular season the team awarded a power play will be allowed to add a skater. All of it has to be better than exhausted five-on-five play.

Also in the final two rounds including the conference finals and the Cup Final the return to the old format in series-clinching games would bring back just enough touch of the old world to satisfy the traditionalists.

It isn’t the prospect of a midnight or 1 a.m. finish that separates the quality of Stanley Cup play from all the rest. Longer is not more. In fact it is typically less.

Above all what makes Cup play stand out is the intense and physical nature of the play the speed and the hitting of it all. It’s the courage the strength the IQ and conditioning. And it’s the majestic Cup itself big and shiny uniquely covered in the names of its winners and not the time on the clock.

NO NEED TO RUSH

Bruins’ Lysell still developing

Fabian Lysell is showing his potential in Vancouver but still needs time before he's ready for the highest level. Bruce Bennett/Getty

Fabian Lysell is signed and sealed but immediate dreams aside the Swedish sharpshooter is not quite ready for NHL delivery — despite his flashy playoff stats in the Western Hockey League.

Lysell the hype around his varsity arrival growing beyond anything that preceded even David Pastrnak in Boston rolled up a robust 4-11—15 line to pace the Vancouver Giants (No. 8 seed) to an upset 4-2 series win over Everett (No. 1 seed) in Round 1 of the playoffs.

The Giants on Friday opened up Round 2 in Kamloops (Mark Recchi a Blazers co-owner) with a 1-0 loss the same night the Bruins played Game 3 of their series against the Hurricanes.

The goal-challenged sons of Bruce Cassidy sure could use someone with 4-11—15 scoring creds these days but it was the right decision to keep Lysell incubating particularly at this time of season. Look no further than the smack Wednesday night that put 6-foot-4-inch Hampus Lindholm on the express train to Palookaville. Lysell 19 is 5-10 and about 175 pounds his body not yet in lockstep with his game.

“He’s got all kinds of skill a great shot great hockey sense — all that will adapt for sure” said Bruins president Cam Neely a Giants alum. “It’s a matter of whether he can handle the NHL size and pace the rigors of it.”

Lysell signed his entry-level deal with the Bruins last August shortly after they made him the No. 21 pick in the draft. The three-year pact won’t begin until he leaves the amateur ranks which could be next season if he and the Bruins figure it’s time to make the jump be it to AHL Providence or Boston.

Pastrnak now one of the game’s elite goal scorers was slightly bigger and stronger when the Bruins drafted him at No. 25 out of the Swedish Hockey League in 2014. That bit of extra heft helped him to turn pro immediately although he didn’t report to Causeway Street until he put up better than a point per game for his first couple of months with the WannaB’s.

“Look where David was right?” noted Neely. “When he first came in he realized he had to get bigger and stronger. But that happens over time when you mature too. That’ll be the same kind of thing with Fabian.”

Left winger Zack Ostapchuk a Giants teammate and left winger led Round 1 WHL scoring with 3-13—16 just a tick ahead of Lysell. Ostapchuk 6-3 and 200 pounds has a frame already more suited for the NHL but at age 18 even with three years of WHL experience the Senators might prefer that he stays put for next season. A big year there possibly with time on Team Canada in the World Junior Championship could provide a power boost into the NHL.

The Bruins and Lysell will decide about his next steps in the offseason. He could go the pro route which likely would mean starting in Providence or he too could remain with the Giants. He delivered a 22-40—62 line in 53 games in the regular season. The question will be whether his game grows more rapidly there or if say the heavier action in the AHL would set him up for better success in the NHL.

The Bruins view Lysell first and foremost as a scorer something they really haven’t drafted and developed since Pastrnak. Jake DeBrusk drafted in 2015 looked headed that way but his career arc has been inconsistent.

Neely has been impressed by Lysell’s shot his ability to score with it his speed and his overall IQ.

“He skates well enough to be in the NHL” Neely said. “And he sees the ice really well. We are optimistic and excited about his potential. He’ll mature naturally but he’s also going to have to put time in the gym add weight but do it right and smart. It’s not just about bulking up but getting stronger.”

Neely preferred not to draw comparisons between Lysell and other NHLers be it for shooting style or scoring methods.

“I just look can he score goals can he put pucks past goalies?” Neely said. “He’s shown that he can do that. I’ve always felt if you are a goal scorer you generally find ways to score goals. Sometimes even said to myself ‘How’d that go in?’ Scorers usually find a way.”

ETC.

More offense a welcome sight

One significant measure in the NHL’s much-welcomed increased offense in 2021-22 was its huge increase in the number of games in which at least one team scored a minimum of five goals. The total was a record 547 games.

Last season only 296 games ended with at least one team connecting for at least a five-spot which placed the year-over-year increase at 84.8 percent in such games.

More scoring power? Yes please.

Full disclosure: The 84.8 percent is bloated because clubs only played a 56-game regular season is 2020-21. The best 82-game comparison would be 2018-19 with 465 games in the five-or-more category making the jump this season 17.6 percent.

The 2021-22 regular season was comprised of 1312 games so the 547 games of five goals or more represented 41.7 percent. On a percentage basis it was the biggest slice since 1992-93 when 539 of 1008 games (53.5 percent) had at least one team with five-plus goals.

Through the first three nights of the playoffs a team reached the five-goal plateau in 9 of 16 games.

Dating to 1949-50 when the six-team NHL increased its schedule to a total 210 games the biggest lode with one team scoring at least five was 61.7 percent in 1985-86 (518 of 840 games).

The NHL’s top three scorers in that season: Wayne Gretzky (Edmonton) 215 points; Mario Lemieux (Pittsburgh) 141; and Paul Coffey (Edmonton) 138.

The Canadiens with rookie Patrick Roy in net won the Stanley Cup.

Loose pucks

Despite missing the playoffs again Sabres fans have some reason for optimism. Joshua Bessex/Associated Press

Fans in Buffalo where the Sabres just pinned up their 11th straight DNQ season feel optimistic about a squad that played at a 102-point rate over the final two months. There hasn’t been much to be happy about in the Queen City so projections at least offer promise. But not always. The Nordiques of the late 1980s and early ’90s often got on a run once they were eliminated from playoff contention but the promised turnaround never materialized even with an eye-popping string of top-end picks. To wit: 1988: Curtis Leschyshyn (3) and Daniel Dore (5); 1989: Mats Sundin (1); 1990: Owen Nolan (1); and 1991: Eric Lindros (1). Yep three consecutive No. 1 picks and the Nordiques were sold and shipped off to Denver in the summer of 1995. Granted they won the Cup as the Avalanche in the spring of ‘96 but mainly because they were gifted a 30-year-old Roy by the Habs in December of that inaugural season. So tread carefully Buffalo unless someone wants to send along the 2022 version of Dominik Hasek … In Ottawa it’s an increasing fait accompli that the Senators will buy out the remaining three years of Colin White’s deal (cap hit: $4.75 million) leaving the ex-Boston College Eagle with a six-year payout of roughly $9.5 million. Career line to date for the 25-year-old pivot: 224 games 36-62—98. He put up 41 points in 2018-19 then signed his six-year deal off that promising season but in part because of injury hasn’t been able to repeat the touch … Noting a “regression” in play on both sides of the puck Red Wings GM Steve Yzerman last Saturday finally dismissed Jeff Blashill as bench boss. The same day ex-Red Wings great Sergei Fedorov coached CSKA Red Army to the KHL’s Gagarin Cup with a Game 7 win (4-1) over Mettalurg Magnitogorsk — a rally from a 3-1 series deficit. Fedorov who won the Stanley Cup with the Winged Wheels in 1997 ‘98 and 2002 could end up on Yzerman’s candidate list … Ex-Bruin Joakim Nordstrom opened the season on the CSKA roster posted 14 points in 27 games then terminated his deal in protest of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s military invasion of Ukraine … One from the road: With colleague Julian Benbow handling the digital vinyl the playlist on the car ride back to the hotel late Wednesday included “Time” by the Chambers Brothers and Joni Mitchell’s “Woodstock” the rendition by the master herself. The old guy at the wheel was near tears even more when fellow Globe scribe Matt Porter looted Mitchell’s line for his column the next day noting it was time for the Bruins to “get back to the Garden.” While in Raleigh it looked as if the Bruins used sticks made of a billion-year-old carbon.

It was added to the F1 bill last season with eight races. That has been increased to 10 races at eight grand prix weekends for 2022.

The first double header is this weekend in Miami while the second will be on the last circuit on the calendar in Mexico City at the end of October. The series will also head to Japan as well as Silverstone.

Eaton – an on-screen test driver for Amazon Prime’s The Grand Tour and an ambassador for Racing Pride which promotes LGBTQ+ inclusivity within motorsport – made her debut in the competition last year.

The 30-year-old who hails from Hull always wanted to be a racing driver but feels that an emergence of high-profile female talent will get more girls into motorsport.

“It is definitely inspiring a new generation of younger female drivers” she told The Yorkshire Post.

“Because it is on such a big platform alongside F1 there are probably Dads who watch it and their young daughter might run past and see girls racing.

“It is inspiring a new class of driver. I think having a little more publicity on that front is great.

“I am 30 now and I started racing when I was 10-years-old. I didn’t have a female role model at that time but I just wanted to race and nobody was going to tell me or show me otherwise – I was going to race regardless.

“Maybe there are young girls out there who aren’t as confident so it is definitely inspiring a new generation.

“I think the long-term aspect of W Series is yet to be seen.”

Eaton has battled hard to get behind the wheel in Miami.

A back injury sustained at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin USA in October brought her season to a premature end.

At times she struggled to deal with the day-to-day complications of the injury but her desire to get back to the W Series was enough to keep her going.

She continued: “It was super tough really tough in all aspects. I had no other option to get better.

“It was about mind over matter and cracking on with it. There were times when I thought ‘why am I in this situation?’ Why am I still digging deep this long after the crash?

“I was so reliant on other people to look after me in terms of driving me places. If I wanted to get to the shops I had to ask someone to take me. There were times when it was really tough.

“I just thought to myself that I would still be able to get back into a car I wasn’t paralysed and I was very lucky. What is four to five months out of my life? I just needed to use that time as best I could to get back.”

A big boost for the W Series for 2022 is a three-year broadcast deal with Sky Sports. The series had been shown on Channel 4 in 2019 and 2021 but Eaton doesn’t feel going behind a paywall will limit the attraction.

She said: “It opens it up to a different audience again. The die-hard fans that subscribe to Sky Sports will hopefully watch our race and it becomes part of their weekend of viewing.

“I think it is fantastic to have these relationships and deals with W Series and hopefully it brings more partnerships on board.”

Eaton claimed four top-10 finishes from the first six races in 2021 and hopes to build on her debut season this year.

She will compete for the Scuderia W Team alongside fellow Yorkshirewoman Sarah Moore who hails from Harrogate and finished fifth in last season’s W Series championship.

Leclerc finished a fighting second 3.786 seconds behind after starting on pole position with Spanish team mate Carlos Sainz completing the podium at the Miami Dolphins' Hard Rock Stadium.

The victory was the Dutch driver's third of the season and second in a row and he made it happen with a crucial overtake around the outside on Sainz at the start to seize second place before blasting past Leclerc on the ninth of the 57 laps.

Verstappen who also made sure of the bonus point for fastest lap then held off a late attack from Leclerc after a safety car period triggered by McLaren's Lando Norris crashing on lap 41.

""It was an incredible Grand Prix"" said Verstappen who has won every race he has finished so far this season and was handed his winner's trophy by Dolphins NFL quarterback great Dan Marino.

""(It was) very physical but I think we kept it exciting until the end.""

Leclerc was right on Verstappen's tail with five laps remaining with the safety car bunching up the pack after struggling with the medium tyres on his opening stint.

""On the hard (tyres) we were very competitive and towards the end I thought I could get Max at one point but today they had the advantage in terms of pace"" said the Monegasque.

Verstappen's Mexican team mate Sergio Perez finished fourth with Ferrari retaining the lead in the constructors' standings on 157 points to Red Bull's 151.

Perez tried to pass Sainz on lap 52 but overcooked his move with the Spaniard forcing his way back in front and staying there.

George Russell continued his record of finishing every race so far in the top five with Mercedes team mate and seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton sixth.

Valtteri Bottas was seventh for Alfa Romeo with Alpine's Esteban Ocon eighth in a stirring fight back after being unable to take part in Saturday's qualifying due to a practice crash that forced the team to change his car's chassis.

Double world champion team mate Fernando Alonso was ninth and Alex Albon 10th for Williams.

There was heartbreak for Mick Schumacher who had been having his best race to date and looked like taking his first point in Formula One until he collided with Aston Martin's Sebastian Vettel.

Vettel and team mate Lance Stroll both started from the pit lane after a fuel temperature problem stopped them from going to the grid.",,,

And while the pandemic is far from over people feel more comfortable leaving their homes and shopping in person. The turnaround has been a headwind for eBay which is seeing spending on its marketplace fall.

Revenue falls slower than GMV for eBay

In its first quarter which ended March 31 eBay reported that gross merchandise value (GMV) decreased 17% year over year. GMV measures the total dollars spent on eBay's platform and it's a crucial metric since eBay takes a percentage of those sales as revenue. Note that eBay does not own the inventory sold on its platform so it relies on transaction fees from bringing buyers and sellers together.

Fortunately eBay's revenue only fell 5% year over year. The smaller revenue decrease can be attributed to eBay raising the fees it charges sellers. Its transaction take rate has steadily increased for several quarters culminating at 12.1% in the latest quarter up from 10.3% in the prior-year period. While shareholders may be pleased to see eBay capturing more of each transaction as revenue these fee increases may not be sustainable. Undoubtedly sellers on eBay's platform are not happy about paying higher fees just as buyer spending is falling.

Alternatively sellers may pass along the higher fees to their customers by raising prices on their products making the platform overall less attractive when compared to competing e-commerce destinations. Either way the result would not be good for eBay. For that reason GMV is vital to the business. Increasing GMV will attract more sellers who want to capitalize on the volume of activity on eBay's marketplace. The rise in sellers will boost selection for buyers attracting even more shoppers.

Exacerbating the decline in GMV eBay has reduced spending on marketing in recent quarters. As a percentage of revenue sales and marketing decreased to 18.6% in the first quarter down from 19.9% in the same quarter last year. Users accustomed to offers like $15 off a purchase of $75 or more saw those promotions less frequently if at all.

Even then the company saw its adjusted operating margin decline nearly five full percentage points to 32.4% in the first quarter.

eBay stock is not expensive

The faster-than-expected slowdown in spending had eBay lower its revenue target for the rest of 2022. It now expects revenue between $9.6 billion and $9.9 billion. This is down from the previous guidance of revenue between $10.3 billion and $10.5 billion. Unsurprisingly the lower revenue expectation decreased adjusted earnings expectations to $4.00 at the midpoint down from the previous midpoint of $4.30.

The stock was down 11.7% the day following the earnings announcement. That sell-off now has eBay trading at an attractive price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 14.4. Revenue could face continued headwinds as consumer behavior returns closer to pre-pandemic habits. Still eBay has done an excellent job boosting earnings per share despite slow revenue growth for many years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXRvZXZvbHV0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL3ByaWNpZXN0LXVzZWQtY2FyLWZvci1zYWxlLW9uLWViYXktaXMtbm90LWEtYnVnYXR0aS1idXQtYS1wb3JzY2hlLWFuZC1pdC1zLWEtZHJlYW0tcmlkZS0xODgwMzAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Priciest Used Car for Sale on eBay Is Not a Bugatti But a Porsche and It's a Dream Ride,"Shopping for a new set of wheels regardless of how many miles it has on the odo or when it was made is always exciting for us petrolheads.

On one hand there are those of us who would never considering buying a brand-new vehicle. At the opposite end of the spectrum are the ones who would never consider buying used. Each scenario has its own ups and downs from a not-so-perfect overall condition and possibly many sleepless nights if buying used to the obvious depreciation issue if buying new. So where do you fit?Actually don’t answer yet because we have a second question for you that is more on-topic: would you buy the pictured Porsche Carrera GT if money was no issue or would you go for something else? At almost $2.7 million which is the asking price on eBay  this was the most expensive used vehicle for grabs on the quoted website at the time of writing – well unless we completely ignore an undisclosed Bugatti probably a Chiron with images said to be coming soon listed for $3.5 million.That much cash would get you that perfect home in most parts of the western world as well as a variety of vehicles to enjoy on a daily basis. Sure to Porsche fanatics not many cars compare to a barely-driven Carrera GT but then again you could get a low-mileage 911 (991) GT2 RS a high-end 4x4 and a great luxury cruiser to use on a daily basis. Kind of reminds me of my perfect three-car garage story.Made in 2004 which was the model’s second year of production it has only two owners in the papers the first of whom held on to it until 2021. Neither of them truly enjoyed it as it has only 809 miles (1302 km) on the clock but that can only be considered as great news by its future owner. The German supercar is finished in black on top of a black interior and save for the gearshift lever it doesn’t show its age at all. The fact that it doesn’t feature any gigantic screens inside is definitely a plus for this writer.Included with the sale are the original books service documents including the latest performed at 795 miles (1279 km) and the luggage set said to be “in exceptionally well-preserved condition.” The vendor a used car dealer specialized in selling all kinds of luxury and exotic machines  claims to have conducted a thorough inspection when it arrived at its new temporary home. Speaking of which you will have to take a trip to Springfield Illinois unless you live there if you want to admire it in person before transferring the funds and signing your name on the dotted line.This Porsche Carrera GT is more than capable of giving its new owner an adrenalin shot courtesy of its naturally aspirated 5.7-liter V10 mounted behind the seats that develops 603 hp and 435 lb-ft (590 Nm) of torque. The 0 to 62 mph (0-100 kph) takes in the region of 3.5 seconds unofficially and just under 4 seconds officially and it will run out of breath at 205 mph (330 kph).On a final note we should tell you that if it ends up changing hands for $2.7 million then this Porsche Carrera GT will break the record currently held by another copy that sold for $2.2 million two months ago. Jerry Seinfeld’s Porsche Carrera GT  meanwhile fetched $1.86 million at auction earlier this year.",,,,,,,,,

The project proposal includes the redevelopment of several office buildings into a high-end life sciences campus on 100 Marine Parkway 1 Twin Dolphin Drive and 3 Twin Dolphin Drive within the Redwood Shore.

Prince Street Partners and Center Capital Partners are the project developers.

The project site is comprised of three buildings totaling 147000 square feet. 85000 square feet of space will be retained at 100 Marine Parkway while the remaining two buildings originally constructed in 1982 will be redeveloped.

Prince Street Partners and Center Capital Partners acquired the site in March of this year for $82.75 million. The property was sold by Rockpoint Group which had held the asset for seven years prior to the sale.

The campus will be located within proximity of several major employers including Electronic Arts Oracle and others. Facebook and Google both have their campuses just a short drive south of the project site.

The project if approved will add to a growing number of life science and tech-oriented development that has graced the area over the years.

He has affirmed that the Titanfall 3 in German GameStop retail stores are allegedly real. However Titanfall 3 metamorphosed into Apex Legends during development and that is what those placeholders refer towards.

Me: ""I don't know but I think Nintendo might do thi–""

Headlines: ""INSIDER LEAKS NINTENDO RELEASE SCHEDULE"" Me: ""I'm begging you to hear me. Apex Legends was Titanfall 3 and there is no real Titanfall 3 in the works""

Headlines: ""TITANFALL 3 FOR SALE IN SECRET GERMAN BROTHELS!"" — Jeff Grubb (@JeffGrubb) May 9 2022

Titanfall series has established itself as a prominent FPS shooter in the gaming industry. Titanfall games intertwine mechs with the high-octane fast-paced action in the usual FPS fashion to deliver an innovative experience. The series is very beloved by its passionate players and their achievements have been witnessed time and time again. The loyal community has unified together several times to protect itself from hostile threats like cyberpunks and has kept the Titanfall 2 servers up and running through diminishing odds.

The chances of Titanfall 3 happening are pretty bleak; Respawn Entertainment has cited in the past that they are not interested in another installment in the Titanfall series. Moreover Respawn Entertainment has its hands full with multiple Star Wars projects. However not all hope is lost for Titanfall fans; the recent rumor is a ray of hope for this FPS’ future. There have been multiple sightings of Titanfall 3 available for pre-order across GameStop retail stores in Germany. Many players have allegedly spotted the game available for pre-order across certain outlets.

In a recent post in r/titanfall on Reddit u/Va0Ce posted a picture of what appears to be Titanfall 3 available for pre-order at a GameStop retail store in Germany. Players have split into different sides of the spectrum stating other possibilities regarding the phenomenon. However the user has commented further on the situation citing “The employee told me it would probably release around fall but on the box it said “no release date announced” so IDK. I’m still not 100% sure if I just wasn’t scammed out of a 10€ down payment but if others saw it too there must be something??”

The text above the Titanfall 3 packaging “Jetzt vorbestellen” translates to “Pre-order now.” In the image we can see multiple games that can be pre-ordered all of them being confirmed for release in the future. It is quite weird that Titanfall 3 is available to be pre-ordered but this could be a rare mistake. Some players have speculated that this could be a tactic to grab money by GameStop in Germany which is also unlikely because it would affect the enterprise entirely. Others have speculated that the user forged the post for attention but similar sightings have been reported in the past making this post unlikely to be fake either.

This isn’t the first time that GameStop retail stores in Germany have leaked something way before any announcement or release either. In January 2017 an employee revealed the release line-up for the Nintendo Switch and posted it on Reddit. Recently in June 2020 Overwatch 2 began appearing for pre-orders on the GameStop website in Germany which revealed the platforms that the game would be available long before its announcement by Blizzard Entertainment.

Multiple people have claimed to witness Titanfall 3 available for pre-order at GameStop retail store in Germany. One similar post in r/titanfall on Reddit by u/MisterShadow001 about two weeks ago went unnoticed for the most part but it also discussed the same situation alongside the evidence. Around six months ago another post discussed the same sighting although it was without any evidence. This post specifically states that the game ought to be out in the last quarter of 2022 according to one of the employees which is highly far-fetched.

All in all we suggest taking this with a massive grain of salt. There is no concrete or official evidence that indicates that Titanfall 3 is even in development. Although Titanfall 3 is mentioned in the popular NVIDIA GeForce Now leak which has been authentic for the most part we’ve learned that not every title revealed will be confirmed however. The most feasible outcome appears to be a mistake on GameStop’s part in Germany.

As we sailed across the Bay of Naples from Sorrento toward Capri the boat captain pulled me over and pointed to the highest point on the island. ""That's where you're going"" he said. I had been obsessed with the Monte Solaro Chair Lift a single-seat open-air ride to the mountaintop ever since I learned about it from a fellow traveler. But looking up at the 1932-foot peak from sea level it suddenly felt daunting.

Capri has long solidified its reputation as a yacht-filled glamorous getaway a favorite of celebrities from Audrey Hepburn and Grace Kelly to Kourtney Kardashian and Hugh Jackman with its dramatic rocky coastline set against transparent blue waters. Though its most famous landmark is no doubt the Blue Grotto the cave with naturally glowing blue waters its most underrated attraction might just be the unique lift to the top of Monte Solaro.

Located in the commune of Anacapri whose prefix implies its ""above"" the main city of Capri on the island of the same name the trip to the starting point of the chairlift takes a long wait for a crowded bus ride up the mountain and into a bustling Piazza Vittoria. Just off the corner of the piazza is the station at Via Caposcuro. There visitors can grab a €9 one-way ticket (or a €12 round-trip ticket) and hop on the 13-minute ride. The chairlift operates year-round. It begins running at 9:30 a.m. and closes between 3:30 p.m. and 5 p.m. depending on the month.

The Monte Solaro chairlift first opened in 1952 as an effortless shortcut to the mountaintop — even actress Rita Hayworth once grabbed a seat. After a 1998 overhaul the ride reopened a year later with new equipment.

Arriving on an off-peak late April afternoon there were only a handful of people ahead of me so there wasn't any time for hesitation as the chair operator simply pointed me to a marked spot and gestured to sit down as he pulled a single bar down in front of me. Before I could blink I was sailing over the town.

As I looked down at my feet dangling over the city I thought the fear would kick in. Despite the 156 seats just hanging from the cable by a single bar to my surprise it oddly felt solid and secure. Within seconds a sense of calm washed over me. As I got farther from the over-crowded city the only sounds were the chirping birds casting a serene soundtrack to the sights that grew more impressive as I inched closer to the top.

The gorgeous blue waters green spring blooms and rocky shores looked even more vibrant from this height. While some portions between the support poles were steeper than others the ride was surprisingly meditative.

Once at the top the operator instructed me exactly when to lift the bar stand up and walk off to the side. Considering I've been known to stop ski lifts with my inability to get off chairlifts this was surprisingly smooth and simple.

Atop the mountain an even more spectacular sight awaited. Walking around the entire perimeter on the clear day the panoramic views featured the entire island of Capri including its three trademark Faraglioni rock formations in the foreground plus some of Italy's most famous sights — Naples Mount Vesuvius the Amalfi Coast and Ischia island — in the distance. There is also a restaurant at the top but during this time of year only the bistro was open so I grabbed a lemon Italian ice and just sat marveling at the unbelievable postcard-worthy scenery enveloping me from every direction.

While some choose to hike one way and take the chairlift the other the ride back down was almost more breathtaking than the upward one as the entire gulf stretched before me during the slow descent.

As soon as my feet touched back on the ground I was jolted back to reality into the busy noisy Anacapri city center confirming how tranquil the chairlift ride truly was. The solitude of the chairlift along with the sky-high views the ride offers is a truly special way to experience the magic of Capri.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9uZXdzL2hlYWx0aC93ZWlnaHQtbG9zcy13ZWVrbHktamFiLXRyaWNrcy0yNjg3ODkzN9IBT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9uZXdzL2hlYWx0aC93ZWlnaHQtbG9zcy13ZWVrbHktamFiLXRyaWNrcy0yNjg3ODkzNy5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Weight loss: Weekly jab tricks body into feeling full and causes 24kg drop,"Participants in the trial lost an average of 22.5 per cent of their body weight. This is more than twice the normal effectiveness of such treatments and could be an alternative to surgery for people living with obesity.

A weight-loss treatment that tricks your body into feeling full has achieved an average weight drop of 24kg in phase three clinical trials. For the obese participants this was the equivalent of losing almost a quarter of their weight.

Obesity experts hope that this treatment which involves a single weekly injection administered at home by the patient could be an alternative to expensive and invasive bariatric surgeries like gastric bands and bypasses.

In the trial's third phase over 2500 people in nine countries each weighing 105 kilograms on average gave themselves weekly injections of 'tirzepatide' at a range of doses or a placebo for 72 weeks. Participants were not aware of which one they were taking.

Those on the highest doses saw the largest weight losses over the course of the 72 weeks where participants also had to follow a moderate diet and exercise regime.

Those in the study's control group who were receiving a placebo saw an average weight loss of just 2kg buoying the drug's producer pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly.

Jeff Emmick Ph.D. vice president of product development at Lilly said: “Tirzepatide is the first investigational medicine to deliver more than 20 per cent weight loss on average in a phase 3 study reinforcing our confidence in its potential to help people living with obesity.""

Tirzepatide works by creating synthetic copies of the hormones that your stomach produces to tell your brain that you are full. Similar but less effective drugs like Semaglutide have recently hit the weight loss market and been described as the ""holy grail"" of obesity treatment.

When Eli Lilly's ""SURMOUNT-1"" trial began the study's 2539 participants weighed 231 pounds and had a BMI of 38 on average. Most of the participants did not qualify for bariatric surgery which is reserved for people with a BMI higher than 40 or those with a BMI from 35 to 40 who also have sleep apnea or Type 2 diabetes.

“Tirzepatide delivered impressive body weight reductions in SURMOUNT-1 which could represent an important step forward for helping the patient and physician partnership treat this complex disease” said Louis Aronne director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at New York's Cornell Medical Center.

By the end of the trial those on the higher doses of tirzepatide saw their BMIs fall to just 30 - taking them within the ""normal"" range of the BMI weight scale though still overweight.

As obesity is a chronic condition these injections could be a lifelong treatment for many but far easier to manage than the diseases and difficulties associated with being obese; these include musculoskeletal complications Type 2 diabetes heart disease and at least 13 types of cancer.

This new treatment is not without its side effects including constipation diahorrea nausea and vomiting in mild to moderate cases. Though study scientists noted that these ""adverse effects"" were lesser than other similar treatments.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3NkYXkubmcvaGVhbHRoL2FydGljbGUvbmlnZXJpYW4tdHJhdmVsbGVycy10by11cy1mYWNlLXJpc2luZy1tYWxhcmlhLXRyZWF0bWVudC1iaWxsL9IBY2h0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3NkYXkubmcvaGVhbHRoL2FydGljbGUvbmlnZXJpYW4tdHJhdmVsbGVycy10by11cy1mYWNlLXJpc2luZy1tYWxhcmlhLXRyZWF0bWVudC1iaWxsLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nigerian travellers to US face rising malaria treatment bill,"Travelling to the United States with the hope of treating severe malaria could result in a financial nightmare as the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) withdraws from supplying treatment to hospitals.

A returning traveller from a malaria-endemic country like Nigeria will only access Intravenous Artesunate the only approved form of treatment in commercial pharmacies at $60000 Boghuma Titanji a Cameroonian medical doctor and clinical researcher said in a tweet.

Checks on the CDC website show that distribution to hospitals will be discontinued from September 30 2022 as it is available in adequate supply from major drug distributors. According to the centre severe malaria should be treated with intravenous (IV) antimalarial medications as the first-line drug for the treatment of severe malaria in the US.

The drug used to be supplied to patients on request free of charge by the CDC as a better standard for treating severe malaria. It was also a replacement for quinidine a previously used drug produced by Eli Lilly but which production stopped in 2017.

Artesunate made by Amivas LLC. Global health got approved in 2020 with a 150-fold hike in price to $30000 for an average cost of treatment for an adult making malaria treatment costlier to treat in the US than in low and middle-income African countries.

Amivas attributed the price hike to the cost of FDA licensing and production combined with the small market for artesunate in the US according to an advocacy piece written by Anne Frosch assistant professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota; Aileen Ahiskali an infectious diseases pharmacist at Hennepin Healthcare and Chandy John a pediatric infectious diseases physician and professor of pediatrics and medicine at Indiana University School of Medicine.

The cost of the drug this year has doubled to $60000 according to Titanji.

In a separate tweet Stone Doggett an infectious disease physician and scientist at the Oregon Health and Science University said the cost of IV artesunate increases at least 10000 times (over $35000)

“I am very interested in the story behind a company being created to manufacture artesunate in partnership with the US Army receiving exclusive rights and potentially a 100 million dollar transferable priority review voucher and settling on a $35000 to $105000 price tag” Doggett said.

Only about 300 people develop severe malaria in the US yearly and artesunate manufactured outside the US cannot be imported.

Malaria treatment in most African countries costs less than $5. In India it is between $10 and $25 for an intravenous Artesunate course depending on when the patient can be switched to oral treatment.

In their plea for urgent solutions in terms of pricing and availability Frosch Ahiskali and John said the financial crisis facing healthcare and the resulting lean hospital budgets mean that medication for uncommon diseases like malaria may not be stocked by most hospitals.

“When purchased after a case is diagnosed because of its limited availability distributors take anywhere from 12 hours at best to five days to deliver the drug a dangerous delay in care” they said.

According to Titanji a returning traveller from a malaria-endemic region with severe malaria in the US could die before the hospital procures the drug due to cost.

Despite being an off-patent and widely used drug she said the sales right is now owned by a few suppliers who have inflated the price for profit.

“The moral of this story is if you are travelling to a malaria-endemic part of the world from the US obtain and take your malaria prophylaxis diligently because the US is the last place you want to have severe malaria right now. Our health system is broken” she said.",,,,,,

The loss of 800 megawatts of carbon-free energy from the nuclear plant along Lake Michigan near South Haven is likely to result in more greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere as the electric sector pivots to natural gas while more solar and wind generation comes online.

In Michigan the state’s climate plan calls for 60 percent of the state’s power to come from renewable sources within the next eight years. Incremental goals in that plan are seen as a factor in the governor’s attempt to keep Palisades running: the plant’s closure will leave a vacuum in already available emissions-free energy.

“It makes the hill tougher to climb” said Dan Scripps chairman of the Michigan Public Service Commission.

Some suggest that despite the late hour the plant’s closure may be avoided should federal assistance arrive in time and a new buyer can be found to run the plant until its licensing expires in 2031. Officials say high-level talks to achieve that are underway.

Gretchen Whitmer made a last-minute play to keep the 50-year-old nuclear power plant operating past its long-planned closure date at the end of this month after President Joe Biden last month announced a $6 billion program to rescue nuclear plants at risk of closing. Whether it will be in time for the Palisades remains unclear though E&E News reported a top U.S. energy official recently confirmed the Michigan plant remains on schedule to close May 31.

That will mean more carbon emissions – at least in the next several years – from an uptick in natural gas plants that are cheaper to operate by power generation companies.

“Long term they believe that they’ll move towards more renewables but in the short term they’re absolutely putting more carbon into the air” said Todd Allen professor and chairperson of University of Michigan’s nuclear engineering department.

“I don’t think you can argue that it’s good from a climate change perspective because you’re replacing something that produces no emissions with something that does.”

Beyond climate impacts the Palisades power plant closure will come with the loss of 600 jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in annual economic impact.

Palisades is owned by Entergy Corp. of Louisiana which is set to close and sell the plant and the former Big Rock Point shoreline nuclear power site in Charlevoix to Holtec International of Florida which intends to terminate the license perform restoration and accept spent fuel management liabilities at both sites.

Entergy officials confirmed they are on track to shut down Palisades on May 31 with the planned sale to Holtec shortly thereafter. Entergy does not intend to remain in the merchant nuclear business officials said.

Entergy Chief Executive Officer Leo Denault said during last week’s earnings call that the last step in the company’s exit from the nuclear market is nearly complete even should any last-minute money from the federal government arrive.

“We are supportive of federal initiatives to keep nuclear plants operating. However we are five years into the Palisades shutdown process and we are far down the path. There are significant technical and commercial hurdles to changing course at this point” Denault said. “That said alongside Holtec we will work with any qualified party that wants to explore acquiring the plant and obtaining federal funding.”

Officials in Whitmer’s office did not respond to MLive’s requests for comment.

Authorities in both Washington and Michigan said it remains a priority to continue with as much nuclear energy as possible as a carbon-free source of power to combat climate change. That’s why there’s a last-ditch effort to keep Palisades and other nuclear plants across the nation running.

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said U.S. nuclear power plants provide more than half of the nation’s carbon-free electricity and the administration wants to keep them running to reach clean energy goals.

“We’re using every tool available to get this country powered by clean energy by 2035” she said.

Between 20 and 25 percent of Michigan’s overall electricity comes from the three currently operating nuclear power plants in the state what Scripps called a critical “part of the puzzle” to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and meet newly established state climate goals.

“There’s no question that the loss of 812 megawatts of generation is going to have an impact” he said.

Scripps remains confident though that federal Department of Energy financing could swoop in and save the plant from final shutdown. The plant closure is based on business he said not intentional climate action to meet emissions reduction goals.

“It’s a reliable unit; it had its best year of operations last year. There is no reason other than economic pressures to close it before the end of its license. It is fully licensed to operate safely through 2031” he said.

Industry officials confirmed nuclear power from Palisades costs more than other types of generation and that is why they will switch to natural gas plants until more solar and other more cost-effective renewable generation develops.

“Nuclear energy just became not really the best value in the market today. And so Entergy decided that they’re going to exit the wholesale nuclear business completely which is why they have decided to close Palisades” said Josh Paciorek Consumers Energy spokesman.

The utility company currently buys the power Palisades generates he said which amounts to about 10 percent of its peak load. They do have plans to get power for customers elsewhere.

Consumers would purchase the natural gas-fired Covert Generating Station near South Haven and an existing methane plant to offset system reliability concerns. Natural gas and methane plants do generate significant greenhouse gas emissions though not as much as coal-fired plants.

Natural gas currently makes up about 31 percent of the company’s generating capacity. It will increase in coming years to 40 percent before than dropping to 10 percent by 2040 Paciorek said.

Consumers intends to build out 8000 megawatts of solar energy over the next two decades and close all three coal-fired units at the J.H. Campbell power plant in Ottawa County by 2025 according to a proposed settlement with a stakeholder coalition as part of the company’s long-term energy plan.

Not everyone remains eager to see Palisades rescued though.

Critics of nuclear energy are celebrating the expected plant closure arguing the abandonment of Palisades and the future closure of coal plants across Michigan will force the industry to invest in solar more heavily along with wind and energy storage capacity.

An Indigenous activist with Citizens Resistance at Fermi Two in Monroe and board member for the Native American Indian Association of Detroit named Jesse James Deer in Water spoke last week during a state House Energy Committee hearing on a bill to fund a feasibility study for future nuclear energy in Michigan.

He argued nuclear energy supply chains create environmental injustices and the risk of radioactive pollution; he also argued plenty of carbon emissions are generated through uranium mining and processing even if nuclear power plants do not directly generate carbon emissions.

Additionally the binational International Joint Commission recently received a report from its Water Quality Board that raised concerns about long-term storage of nuclear waste along Great Lakes shorelines such as at Palisades and Big Rock Point. The report said nuclear waste will remain a substantial problem as long as there remains no federal long-term storage facility and the hazards of climate change continue to accelerate within the Great Lakes Basin – North America’s most valuable freshwater resource.

Scripps said a decision about whether federal financing will save Palisades is expected in mid-June after Entergy stops running the nuclear power plant but before the sale to Holtec is finalized.

Posted on 05/07/2022

For 2022 private direct deals made by sovereign wealth funds continue to increase according to transaction data from the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute (SWFI). However private cross-border deals remain leveled as domestic and regional direct investment continues to grow. In addition direct deals including public stock purchases were higher in amounts during the “buy the dip” plays made by some sovereign funds during the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of sovereign investors have positioned their deal-making teams to target inflation-resistance assets for 2022. For example from the start of 2020 till March 31 2022 sovereign investors directly invested US$ 5.447 billion in the data center industry according to SWFI transaction data. Some SWFs directed their fixed income portfolios to increase investment in TIPS while attempting to lower exposure in U.S. Treasuries.

The Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute tracks investment activity of sovereign wealth funds pensions endowments and other institutional investors globally. For this analysis SWFI is excluding fund commitments fund platforms and open market transactions as direct deals tend to show an investor’s conviction in a particular theme. In the first quarter of 2022 sovereign wealth funds invested a total of US$ 26.995 billion in 107 private deals up from US$ 20.439 billion in deal amount and 120 deals in the first quarter of 2021. In the first quarter of 2021 real estate and energy investments by sovereign wealth funds were the top choices compared to real estate and healthcare in the first quarter of 2022. It is important to note that most of the healthcare transactions in the 2022 early period were before the Russian invasion of the Ukraine.

Healthcare Investments

Some notable first quarter 2022 sovereign investor deals in the healthcare sector include Abu Dhabi Investment Authority’s investment in AmeriVet Veterinary Partners a consolidator of veterinary practices. Singapore’s GIC Private Limited and ADIA participated as co-investors in Athenahealth.

Sovereign funds continued to invest in data centers and data center developments. GIC parked money with Equinix to build and operate two xScale data centers in Seoul. A major deal in this period is Singapore’s Temasek Holdings deal to buy Element Materials Technology Limited. Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) committed capital to Bodhi Tree a company originated from James Murdoch a son of Rupert Murdoch of News Corporation. QIA was later found to be backing investor of Elon Musk’s buyout of Twitter Inc.

Another interesting deal in the data space is private equity firm Warburg Pincus and Mubadala Investment Company buying Pharma Intelligence a provider of specialist intelligence data and software for clinical trials drug development and regulatory compliance from Informa PLC.

Sovereign wealth funds especially oil-based investors are flushed with more cash after years of conservative inflows. Sovereign wealth funds are poised to make inroads while traditional investors decrease their appetite for risk and cut losses.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In a 2020 Wall Street Journal article a survey detailed how 63% of people said that the “mother and daughter” relationship in the family is flourishing the most. There’s no doubt the relationship between a mother and a daughter can be a close-knit bond. Moms can be teachers healers and guides in times of need. In the same vein daughters are the extension of a new generation paving the way forward to the future. And when mother-daughter duos share a passion for business and creating this dichotomy can prove to be a recipe for success.

Working with a parent or child also transforms the traditional relationship presenting new roles and dynamics that perhaps weren’t there before. And though this in itself may come with its challenges surprisingly enough its benefits can often outweigh the difficult obstacles these duos face.

Proof of these benefits are the powerful mother-daughter duos (and trios!) highlighted ahead. In addition to succeeding in their businesses the five hard-working teams are experts at knowing how to make the most of working with a family member. More importantly they reveal to TZR their successes in the businesses they share and how their relationship as mother and daughter often works in their favor. Of course every business can have its speed bumps but these duos confirm that hurdles might look smaller when you work together with someone you trust and love.

House Of Aama

As one of the recent winners of the 2021 CFDA Vogue Fashion Fund House of Aama is a a rapidly rising star in the fashion industry. The seeds of House of Aama were planted way back when Akua Shabaka was in high school selling upcycled vintage garments on her Etsy shop. Her mother Rebecca Henry (a former attorney) helped with the sewing and cutting of the orders. “That was the start of our partnership” says Shabaka to TZR. “My mother is a craftswoman. House of Aama was very different at the time but the mission remains the same. The brand is an expression of history exploration of stories and identity.”

Moving on from the vintage resale market the mother-daughter business duo started their company by designing timeless garments informed by historical research archival analysis and storytelling. Shabaka adds “We aim to evoke dialogue social commentary and conversations around heritage and remembrance and shed light on nuanced histories specifically in the African content and diaspora.”

When asked about a favorite memory she shares with working with her daughter Henry points to this pivotal time of new growth for House of Aama. “As someone now in their second act in life after being a practicing attorney for years it brings me joy seeing our name and garments in major publications magazines and in the same room with designers I admired for years” Henry explains. There’s also something to be said about reaching a coveted career milestone like a CFDA award with your daughter or mother. “I remember grabbing my mother’s hand tight and doing our first-ever walkout” Shabaka says. “The cheers smiles and applause were so emotional and I was so happy to have her as a partner by my side.”

Bernadette

For Bernadette and daughter Charlotte De Geyter it seems like starting a fashion line together was always in the cards. The duo launched the successful dress label Bernadette in 2019 in Antwerp Belgium where they are both from. Charlotte explains that after she graduated from Antwerp’s fashion academy she realized she wanted to start something with her mother. “I had moved to London and we called each other every day” recalls Charlotte. “We have always had a close relationship and shared the same vision of fashion. We knew we had a special story to tell and couldn’t wait any longer to start”.

Even when it came to creating the brand identity Bernadette and Charlotte both worked together to create the vision. “I had drawn and painted my whole life so I knew we wanted to include this in our brand” says Charlotte. “I started drawing lots of botanical drawings which later I translated into the prints of our first collection. These prints have become one of our brand’s signatures.”

Bernadette’s contribution is embedded in the brand’s hero product: dresses. “We also always knew we loved dresses just the ease of throwing on a dress and not thinking about it for too long” explains Charlotte. “My mum had always gathered a beautiful archive of dresses she took care of for so long. This consisted of pieces from my grandmother vintage nightgowns second-hand designer dresses etc. We had a lot to work with and all these elements have become the foundation of our brand.”

Bernadette who carries the role of co-founder and creative director takes pride in her daughter’s work ethic and ability to take on multiple responsibilities within the business. “Charlotte is hyper-focused and loves to take on new and different challenges” she says. “She can switch from designing and being in her world to meetings with the accountants and talking about finance. She’s a chameleon.” There’s more to come with this eclectic duo as they continue creating more colorful unique and exciting pieces but the special mother-daughter bond will always be the heart of the Bernadette brand.

Dr. Barbara Sturm

“Combating inflammation has been a central target of my entire medical career” says Dr. Barbara Sturm the founder and CEO of her eponymous brand Dr. Barbara Sturm. The German aesthetics doctor is well known for her non-surgical anti-aging skin treatments creating several award-winning beauty products. After she invented her first doctor-issued blood plasma-based cream called MC1 and prescribed it to her patients they started asking her to create an entire skin care regimen. And so Dr. Barbara Sturm the skin care line was born.

Eventually Dr. Sturm’s passion for the company rubbed off on her daughter Charly who is the vice president of brand development for the company. “It ended up being a natural process for me to join full time when I finished school because of how passionate and inspired I was by everything my mom did” says Charly Sturm to TZR.

Dr. Sturm sees her daughter as the next generation of the company. “Her perspectives and insights are invaluable” Dr. Sturm says. “And I trust her great taste and instincts.” When asked how they manage a balance in working together Charly says it’s about ensuring you’re not stepping on each other’s toes. “I think we handle that well by keeping a lot of our working relationship separate — I work in different business areas and on different projects than my mom” Charly adds. “There are of course things we collaborate on too but it feels like that happens organically. Because we want to.” The best part about working with her mom? Spending time with her of course. “When we travel together for work or attend events together we make a powerful team — it’s an amazing feeling” says Charly. “I’m grateful that we get to do this business together.”

Interior Design By S&S

Based out of Atlanta Georgia Sharon Falcher and Sherica Maynard are the mother-daughter team leading interior design firm Interior Design By S&S. The duo focuses on “liveable luxury” and designing a functional yet inviting home their clients can find peace in.

After years of working in the design industry running a window treatment fabrication workroom and interior design franchise Falcher decided to start her own venture. With her daughter Sherica Maynard newly graduated from design school the mother and new business owner saw an opportunity and asked her child to join forces with her. The rest as they say is history. The two now share leadership in a successful firm focused on residential and commercial interior design.

For Maynard (who serves as the company’s creative director) her mother’s attention to detail made the transition from college student to business partner a smoother one. “It's great having someone with so much experience and knowledge in this industry” she says to TZR. “This made the transition super easy because mom is organized so when I moved she already had systems in place that were easily replicated so that I could thrive as well.” Falcher is equally enthusiastic about working alongside her daughter saying she fills in the gaps she’s unable to fill for the brand with the two ultimately complementing each other’s strengths.

“Having someone you can trust and count on is great” says Falcher. “Sherica is very reliable. They say it's important when you hire to hire [someone whose strength is] your weakness and Sherica fills in the gaps where I lack.” When asked about any struggles faced at the beginning of working together Falcher says boundaries were something they struggled with initially. “It's hard to play the role of mom and boss because those are both traditional roles but in different ways” she explains noting the importance of recognizing when it’s appropriate to assume those separate roles. “We understand each other's boundaries which makes our work and personal relationships work so well.”

Monica Rich Kosann

Based out of Connecticut Monica Rich Kosann is a high-end jewelry brand focused on making timeless pieces that are not just beautiful but empowering and inspiring for the consumer. Monica who’s had a 30-year career as a portrait photographer founded the brand in 2003 with her husband. Nearly 20 years later her now-grown daughters Danielle and Laura have joined the team making up the creative side of MRK (Danielle is currently the artistic director and Laura though involved in other projects outside of MRK leads the brand’s video content strategy). “I have so much respect for my daughters” says Monica to TZR. “I barely touch some parts of the business nowadays allowing us to work on projects together while still assuming different roles and responsibilities.”

The mother and jewelry designer was always inspired by her own eclectic collection of vintage accessories and jewelry and the personalization of them all. After initially selling sourced vintage pieces to her photography clients she found a niche market in lockets and charm necklaces that propelled her to go full-time with MRK. More importantly she realized how successful the brand was at identifying with multiple generations including her daughters’ who became quick fans of the brand. “I knew my jewelry was speaking to all generations when my daughters would constantly borrow my jewelry” says Monica.

Working together as a team came naturally to Monica and her daughters given their already close relationship. “My daughters have always been my inspiration for the brand; who’s going to be more honest with you about whether something looks good or not than your own daughters?” says Monica. When Danielle became a mother for the first time Monica wanted to gift her a unique one-of-a-kind locket. But Danielle wanted something more simple than the signature MRK locket. The new mom wanted an everyday piece that was sleek yet still stayed true to the vintage MRK look and feel. Ultimately this initial custom gift from mother to daughter became one of the brand’s best-selling collections The Slim Locket collection.

Danielle herself says collaborating with her mother has always been rewarding and having the ability to be honest is something she values when working with her.

MERRIMACK NH - Merrimack Fire Rescue and police responded to Joppa Road near the corner of Patten for a report of an SUV into a utility pole on Saturday.

Responders arrived at 3:05 p.m. and found a large SUV that had crashed into the pole and snapped it. Merrimack Police shut down the roadway so that firefighters could give medical attention to 3 people. Two ambulances transported victims to a Nashua hospital with what appeared to be non-life-threatening injuries.

It appears the vehicle for unknown reasons left the right side of the roadway and struck the pole. Bailey’s Towing responded to the scene and removed the vehicle so Eversource could begin repairs. Merrimack Police are investigating the accident. Police put out a traffic advisory that stated the road would be blocked near Patten Rd for several hours while repairs are made.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Beauregard Electric Cooperative Inc. has joined with four other electricity providers to create a new power-buying coalition that will begin executing contracts in the year 2025.

BECi joins Claiborne Electric Cooperative Northeast Louisiana Power Cooperative South Louisiana Electric Cooperative Association and Washington – St. Tammany Electric Cooperative Inc. in what is being named the 1803 Electric Cooperative. Combined the cooperatives represent more than 120000 consumers in Louisiana.

According to Beauregard Electric General Manager Kevin Turner the cooperatives “pooled their power supply needs” in creating the new alliance that he said is projected to save the member distribution cooperatives about $40 million a year when compared to existing contracts.

“With the changing face of modern power procurement comes challenges to the way electric cooperatives secure the power their member owners need. BECi chose to meet these challenges by uniting with four other Louisiana cooperatives to form 1803 Electric Cooperative. By uniting the five cooperatives created a larger more attractive power demand to facilitate more participation from large-scale power brokers” Turner said in a release printed in Beauregard Electric’s recent newsletter to members.

Named for the year of the Louisiana Purchase the new cooperative will be comprised of a board of directors consisting of the five cooperative managers and one board member from each of the five cooperatives according to Turner. The move was approved by the Louisiana Public Service Commission in January.

BECi VP of Marketing and Member Services Kay Fox said the move to become part of a larger organization to seek out power suppliers will not change Beauregard Electric’s name or local operations.

“We are still Beauregard Electric; we are not going anywhere. We have been here since 1939 and we are only getting larger and stronger so this doesn’t change anything for us” Fox said.

Fox said that as BECi officials searched for ways to find a better deal at a reduced rate for its members they soon learned that there was strength in size.

By seeking out vendors and contracts as part of a larger organization with more members Fox said BECi was able to obtain more competitive rates.

She said officials are anticipating a 10 to 15 percent rate decrease for members starting in 2025 after the current contract with Cleco Cajun expires and the new contracts are put into action. At that time the 1803 Cooperative will execute six agreements that will include a solar power contract with Bayou Galion that was just approved this month by the Public Service Commission.

Bayou Galion will provide power from its future 98-megawatt solar farm in northeast Louisiana. The solar farm will be located on 1000 acres of land in Morehouse Parish and construction is projected to begin next year. It is expected to power more than 18000 homes annually and offset the equivalent of 170 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year.

Also within its portfolio of vendors will be other solar providers including Bayou Tech Solar LLC in St. Mary Parish and Bayou Chico Solar LLC in Evangeline Parish who will provide 245 megawatts combined.

Another agreement will tap a future highly efficient combined-cycle gas turbine generator to be constructed by Kindle Energy LLC and owned and operated by Magnolia Power in Iberville Parish that is expected to provide around 409 megawatts of power.

Other providers include Exelon for 27 percent of the load established by the new cooperative’s members to provide 270 megawatts and an option for energy during peak periods from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. if needed from Calpine to total 185 megawatts.

The 1803 Electric Cooperative’s portfolio also includes a U.S. government hydro allocation through the Southwest Power Administration for about 36 megawatts.

All contracts are for 20 years except for the Calpine and Exelon agreements which are for five years.

Turner said the 1803 cooperative received nearly 200 vendor offers before selecting the power providers “through complex analysis”.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee L is driving off with a prestigious award. Two of the most respected magazines are singling out the Jeep Grand Cherokee L as the Best Full-Size SUV in the Annual Good Housekeeping Best Family Car Competition. This award carries some serious weight because Good Housekeeping teamed up with Car and Driver to test and rate the vehicles.

Why the Jeep Grand Cherokee L Was Chosen



According to the magazine’s overview editors chose the Jeep Grand Cherokee L for several reasons.

“With legitimate off-road credentials and a three-row interior the 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee L is an adventure mobile with room for the whole family which earned it an Editors' Choice award. While it will likely see more on-road duty than it will trail time Jeep offers several capability enhancing features including an adjustable air suspension a limited-slip rear differential and three different versions of the brand's Quadra-Drive all-wheel-drive system. Even the most spartan models offer a comfortable and well-tailored cabin but high-end versions bring a full luxury experience—as well as a luxury price tag. Tech plays a big role in the Grand Cherokee L with a plethora of displays screens dotting the interior and a host of driver-assistance features offered as standard.”

“The all-new Jeep Grand Cherokee L truly stands out in its segment and continues to raise the bar in capability performance and luxury while also breaking new ground in versatility and functionality. When it comes to full-size SUVs the Grand Cherokee sets the bar extremely high with its legendary 4x4 capability uncompromised third-row capacity and premium amenities” said Jim Morrison senior vice president and head of Jeep brand North America. “The entire Grand Cherokee lineup – including the first electrified two-row 4xe variant – has something to offer every customer including families that may need extra space or those who enjoy a bit more adventure off the beaten path.”

The Growing Grand Cherokee Family of Vehicles



The Grand Cherokee is already the most awarded SUV ever. Now Jeep has expanded the Grand Cherokee family to include the extended L version as well as the electrified 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe PHEV. The plug-in hybrid has been very well-received following in the tracks of the 2022 Jeep Wrangler 4xe.

How Good Housekeeping Rated the Vehicles

The Good Housekeeping Institute (GHI) worked with Car and Driver to test hundreds of new vehicles and to identify the top makes and models for 2022. GHI experts and editors logged thousands of miles on test tracks and roads. Vehicles were rated based on safety value handling interior design comfort and technology. They also looked at how easy it was to put in a child safety seat. Reviewers also rated features like storage and cargo space.

The Grand Cherokee L has more than 110 advanced safety and security features plus available driver-assist systems 360-degree surround view drowsy driver detection and night vision cameras. One of the most popular features is the rear-seat monitoring camera system.

Shell's adjusted earnings for example rose to $9.1 billion while Exxon Mobil reported $5.48 billion in profits.

Rising prices have boosted the profits of major energy companies further contributing to global inflation and the cost-of-living crisis.

As households around the globe struggle with rising energy bills some of the world's leading oil giants reported record profits for the first three months of this year.

Profits for Exxon Mobil Shell and more also rose by billions despite significant costs of exiting operations and/or investments in Russia amid war in Ukraine.

After Russia invaded Ukraine in February the price of oil climbed in 2022's first quarter – as countries that rely heavily on Russia for energy scrambled for alternative fuel sources amid uncertainty.

The benchmark for global oil prices Brent crude averaged at $102.23 a barrel during the first quarter – 67% higher than during the same period last year according to the Associated Press. In the United States for example drivers have consequently found increasingly expensive gas prices at the pump.

Home heating bills and electricity prices also inflated worldwide – as natural gas prices climbed from $3.50 per million British thermal units to about $5.60.

High oil and gas prices have boosted the profits of major energy companies further contributing to global inflation and the cost-of-living crisis.

The net profit margin of S&P 500 companies which include energy giants such as Chevron and Exxon Mobil in the first quarter has been running at 12.3% based on estimates and earnings reported so far according to FactSet. That’s down from a peak of 13.1% in the second quarter of last year but above the pre-COVID-19 level of about 11%.

“Profit margins should be coming down” Lindsay Owens executive director of Groundwork Collaborative a progressive economic policy research group previously told USA TODAY.

Instead she noted “they’re actually growing.”

Here's a breakdown of the profits and earnings some of the world's oil giants made in the first three months of 2022:

►Price gouging:Critics say corporate greed is making inflation worse citing record profits despite rising costs

Shell earnings rise to $9.1 billion

In the first quarter Shell's adjusted earnings rose to $9.1 billion from $3.2 billion in the same period last year. Net income rose to $7.3 billion from $5.8 billion in last year's first quarter.

Shell said that it would also take a $3.9 billion charge to cover the cost of exiting investments in Russia which the London-based energy giant pledged to do after the invasion of Ukraine.

BP records $6.2 billion profit

BP posted its highest quarterly profit in over a decade – with the British energy company announcing on Tuesday that its underlying replacement cost profit rose to $6.2 billion in the first three months of this year more than doubling the $2.6 billion from the same period last year.

BP PLC also said its net loss in the first quarter totaled $23 billion after accounting for a write-off of its nearly 20% stake in Russian oil producer Rosneft in response to the Ukraine war.

Both BP and Shell's recent profit reports have contributed to calls in Britain for the government to impose a tax on energy companies’ windfall earnings in hopes of helping consumers struggling with rising energy prices. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has rejected the idea  saying the tax would reduce investment in Britain during efforts to diversify the country's energy industry.

The British government’s “refusal to tax the super-profits of energy companies is completely unforgivable when people are too terrified to heat their homes” Ed Davey leader of the Liberal Democrats told the Associated Press.

Exxon doubles profits from last year to $5.48 billion

At the end of April Exxon Mobil reported $5.48 billion in profits during the first quarter of 2022 – also more than doubling its profits compared with the same period last year. Revenue for the Irving Texas-based company was $90.5 billion far exceeding the revenue of $59.15 billion during the same quarter in 2021.

But after abandoning Russian operations due to the war Exxon also took a significant hit writing down $3.4 billion.

Chevron reports $6.26 billion profit

Also at the end of April Chevron reported a quarterly profit of $6.26 billion over four times its earnings of $1.4 billion in the first quarter of last year. Revenue for the San Ramon California-based energy producer surged 41% to $54.37 billion.

Sinopec totals $3.45 billion net profit

According to Reuters China Petroleum & Chemical Corp or Sinopec reported 22.61 billion yuan ($3.45 billion) net profit under Chinese accounting standards for the first quarter of 2022 compared to 17.93 billion yuan ($2.69 billion) last year.

Sinopec also saw a 25% surge in net income.

Phillips 66's adjusted earnings of $595 million

For the first quarter of the year Phillips 66 reported first-quarter earnings of $582 million with adjusted earnings of $595 million.

In 2021 Phillips 66 reported a first-quarter loss of $654 million with an adjusted loss of $509 million.

Deane-Hughes in identical letters addressed to Exxon’s Alistair Routledge and the EPA’s Kemraj Parsram highlighted a number of concerns with the proposed consultations for the gas-to-power project.

On April 20 ExxonMobil through its consultant Environmental Resource Management (ERM) submitted the environmental study for the US$1.3b gas-to-shore project which the government hopes will lead to vastly lower energy costs that would enable a spurt in manufacturing. There have been doubts over the country’s execution capacity and whether a feasibility study has been done for this massive project which would be the biggest in the country’s history.

The submission of the environmental study has triggered the 60-day public review process. In accordance with Section 11 (10) of the Environmental Protection Act Cap. 20:05 members of the public can review the EIA and make written submissions to the Environmental Protection Agency as they consider appropriate. All submissions are to be addressed to the Executive Director of the EPA and sent to the Ganges Street Sophia office or emailed to epa@epaguyana.org.

Exxon through public notices in the press advertised that face-to-face sessions will be held with information on the gas-to-energy project the EPA environmental authorization process and the findings from the assessment to “support public awareness.” In total there are 11 such sessions scheduled.

The first session is scheduled for Lachmansingh Primary School West Coast Berbice on Monday May 9 2022 at 10 am with the final session at Patentia Primary West Bank Demerara on May 20.

In a statement Deane-Hughes said that she is seeking a moratorium on the consultations to facilitate the filing of concerns as specified by the Environment Protection Act. She added that citizens should be allowed uninterrupted the time to comb through the voluminous document and then raise their concerns.

“…[the PR campaign] adds nothing to the already submitted EIA&EIS but may act as a distraction factor and even muddy the waters of good intentions. EEPGL and/or ExxonMobil is not in a competitive process for the issuance of permits for the gas-to-energy pipeline so a mere postponement will not affect the decision made. In fact if they chose to conduct their campaign in the June-August 2022 period this can be comprehended as a sign of respect and goodwill for the people of Guyana a country where they are concentrating their current future developments and investments inter alia” her statement said.

Deane-Hughes said though Exxon claims to have conducted consultations in Regions 1-6 none of those was done in Canal #1 WBD – a community that stands to be impacted by the pipelines.

“We also have protection under the ambit of the EP-Act which has been violated. These omissions along with other glaring implementation of plans errors call into question the validity of the entire document as well as question the sincerity of their CSR” she said.

Additionally the attorney argued that if an alternative route with the pipeline landing at Leonora and running along the Boerasirie dam owned by the Government of Guyana is used then there will be no need to acquire private property. She however did not provide a source of this information and efforts to contact her yesterday were futile.

The pipeline is expected to land at Crane/Nouvelle Flanders West Coast Demerara and make its way to Wales on the West Bank of the Demerara. The project will involve capturing associated gas produced from crude oil production operations on the Liza Phase 1 (Destiny) and Liza Phase 2 (Unity) Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessels transporting approximately 50 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscfd; 1.4 million standard cubic meters per day [MMsm3/d]) of gas via a subsea pipeline and then an onshore pipeline to a natural gas liquids (NGL) processing plant (NGL Plant) treating the gas to remove NGLs for sale to third parties and ultimately delivering dry gas meeting government specifications for use at the Power Plant.

The project includes the construction and operation of a natural gas pipeline from the Liza Phase 1 (Destiny) and Liza Phase 2 (Unity) FPSO vessels via a subsea line and then an onshore natural gas pipeline to an onshore NGL Plant. The pipeline will transport up to approximately 50 MMscfd of dry gas to the NGL Plant. The NGL Plant will drop the pressure of the gas; dehydrate the gas; separate out the NGLs (i.e. propane butane and pentanes+) for sale to third parties; and treat the remaining “dry” gas to the specifications appropriate for use as fuel or raw materials by third parties.

In her letters to both Routledge and Parsram Deane-Hughes said that delaying the process would neither add nor take away from Exxon’s position of attainment. She also argued that the EIA document fails to assess the impacts landowners and residents in the direct vicinity will suffer."

Last week F5 disclosed a new critical remote code execution in BIG-IP networking devices tracked as CVE-2022-1388. This vulnerability affects the BIG-IP iControl REST authentication component and allows remote threat actors to bypass authentication and execute commands on the device with elevated privileges.

As F5 BIG-IP devices are commonly used in the enterprise this vulnerability is a significant risk as it would allow threat actors to exploit the bug to gain initial access to networks and then spread laterally to other devices.

These types of attacks could be used to steal corporate data or deploy ransomware on all of the network's devices.

Exploits easily created

This weekend cybersecurity researchers from Horizon3 and Positive Technologies were both able to create exploits for the new F5 BIG-IP vulnerability. They warned that all admins should immediately update their devices as soon as possible due to the trivial nature of the exploit.

Zach Hanley Chief Attack Engineer at Horizon3 told BleepingComputer that it took them only two days to discover the exploit and expect threat actors to begin exploiting devices soon.

""Given that the mitigations released by F5 for CVE-2022-1388 were a very large hint at where to look when reversing the application we expect that threat actors may have also discovered the root cause as well"" Hanley told BleepingComputer via email.

""It took the Horizon3.ai attack team of two security researchers two days to track down the root cause so we fully expect by end of next week that this will be taken advantage of by threat actors.""

Hanley also warned that the impact of this exploit would be significant as it allows threat actors to gain root access to the devices which hackers will use for initial access to the corporate networks.

""The saving grace here is that this vulnerability only affects the management side of the device which should not be exposed to the internet"" continued Hanley.

However Rapid7 researcher Jacob Baines tweeted that there are still 2500 devices exposed to the Internet making this a substantial risk to the enterprise.

Horizon3 says they will be publicly releasing their proof-of-concept exploit this week to push organizations to patch their devices.

Install security updates immediately

The good news is that F5 has already released BIG-IP security updates that admins can apply for the following firmware versions:

BIG-IP versions 16.1.0 to 16.1.2 (Patch released)

BIG-IP versions 15.1.0 to 15.1.5 (Patch released)

BIG-IP versions 14.1.0 to 14.1.4 (Patch released)

BIG-IP versions 13.1.0 to 13.1.4 (Patch released)

BIG-IP versions 12.1.0 to 12.1.6 (End of Support)

BIG-IP versions 11.6.1 to 11.6.5 (End of Support)

Why you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test .

Despite all the benefits that DDR5 brings to the forefront the new memory standard didn't start off on the right foot. The fact is that DDR5 debuted in the middle of a global semiconductor shortage which hindered its adoption rate due to inflated pricing. However pricing for DDR5 memory kits has improved but there is still a long way to go before it's competitive with DDR4 pricing; therefore consumers are reluctant to jump on the bandwagon. Moreover DDR5 is still wet behind the ears and struggles to compete with high-end DDR4. However it's slowly getting there and G.Skill's recent Trident Z5 RGB DDR5-6400 C32 memory kit is a testimony that DDR5 is progressing in the right direction.

G.Skill's Trident Z5 RGB memory is among the best-looking DDR5 kits around. The memory comes in two flavors: metallic silver or matte black. On this occasion we're taking a look at the latter. Unlike the metallic silver variant that features silver and black tones the matte black version sports an all-black aluminum heat spreader.

The heat spreader with the translucent RGB light bar on the Trident Z5 RGB isn't offensively tall; however the memory module has a height of 42mm (1.65 inches) so you should double-check for compatibility issues either way. You can tweak the lighting using G.Skill's lightweight Trident Z Lighting Control software or your motherboard. The compatibility list includes Asus Aura Sync Gigabyte RGB Fusion 2.0 MSI Mystic Light Sync and ASRock Polychrome Sync.

The Trident Z5 RGB DDR5-6400 memory modules incorporate SK hynix's H5CG48MEBDX014 (M-die) integrated circuits (ICs). In addition the power management IC (PMIC) has the ""0D=8M 24A"" marking. After dumping the memory's SPD through the CPU-Z software we found out that Richtek is the maker of this unit.

Like any overclocked DDR5 G.Skill's memory kit will default to DDR5-4800 with 40-40-40-76 timings. The XMP 3.0 profile configures the data rate up to DDR5-6400 timings to 32-39-39-102 and applies 1.4V to the DRAM voltage. See our PC Memory 101 feature and our How to Shop for RAM story for more on timings and frequency considerations.

G.Skill's memory kit boasted excellent performance clinching the top spot in our application performance chart. The Trident Z5 RGB DDR5-6400 C32 excelled in most of the benchmarks except for Cinebench R23 where it came in fourth.

DDR5 speeds don't make a huge difference in gaming performance. Nonetheless the Trident Z5 RGB was only second to G.Skill's own Trident Z5 RGB DDR5-6000 C36.

Overclocking and Latency Tuning

When you run hardware outside of the manufacturer's specifications there's always a potential risk of damage. That's the standard caveat with overclocking any piece of hardware not just memory. We've already reached out to SK hynix to inquire about the maximum safe voltage for its ICs but we haven't received any feedback on safe voltages for overclocking. However after speaking with various memory vendors they've agreed that 1.4V is the maximum voltage you would want to pump into DDR5 for an extended time.

Since the Trident Z5 RGB DDR5-6400 C32 already operates with 1.4V we increased it to 1.45V for some wiggle room. However the SK hynix M-die ICs were easy to overclock and we got the memory kit to DDR5-6600 with the exact advertised timings (32-39-39-102) for DDR5-6400.

The Trident Z5 RGB memory kit has a great CAS Latency (32); however its other timings need some work. Sadly there wasn't a considerable margin for optimization. Even at 1.45V we only reduced the tRCD tRP and tRAS from 39-39-102 to 37-37-97.

Bottom Line

G.Skill's Trident Z5 RGB DDR5-6400 C32 memory kit is speedy there's no doubt about that. The memory would look great in any build and offers some headroom for free performance if you're into overclocking or don't mind running the memory kit at a higher voltage. So the biggest question is whether the memory kit is worth the premium price tag.

The Trident Z5 RGB DDR5-6400 C32 currently retails for $449.99. The Trident Z5 RGB DDR5-6000 C36 which used to sell for $489.99 has dropped to $399.99. So the Trident Z5 RGB DDR5-6400 C32 won't let you down if you're after what is the fastest and greatest DDR5 memory kit for the time being. But if top-tier performance isn't a priority in your book then the Trident Z5 RGB DDR5-6000 C36 is still a more sensible alternative.",,,,,,,,,

MEMPHIS Tenn. — In 2001 having a ""big four"" sports team was relatively new to the Mid-South.

At the time the Memphis area had minor league and college teams in hockey football basketball and football.

After no playoff appearances during their six years as the Vancouver Grizzlies from 1995 to 2001 ESPN reported Seattle billionaire John McCaw Jr. sold the team to businessman Michael Heisley.

Moving from Vancouver to Memphis

At the time the $160 million sale went through Heisley said he expected to keep the team in Vancouver the New York Times reported. With more than $40 million in losses during the 2000-01 season he obtained permission from the NBA to explore a move according to the Times.

ESPN reported there were six cities in which Heisley was considering moving the team—Las Vegas Anaheim St. Louis New Orleans Louisville and ""to a certain extent Memphis.""

According to ESPN a group of investors led by AutoZone founder J.R. Hyde and his wife Barbara helped with corporate efforts in the Memphis area to attract the Grizzlies. FedEx supported the move saying they'd back building what's now the FedExForum which cost $250 million to build.

When the team moved from Vancouver in 2001 (after six seasons north of the border) they played their games at the Pyramid arena. This lasted from 2001 to 2004. In fall 2004 they moved to their current home—the FedExForum.

More new owners

The team returned to the playoffs in 2011 and took down the top-seeded San Antonio Spurs as the 8th seed in the first round before falling to the Oklahoma City Thunder in seven games.

A group led by Robert Pera bought the team in 2012 for $377 million the New York Times reported. Under Pera's ownership the Grizzlies have appeared in the playoffs seven times including a trip to the Western Conference Finals in 2013.

After rebuilding years from 2007 to 2010 and a decline from 2017 to 2019 Pera restructured the team's front office bringing in Jason Wexler as team president and promoting Zach Kleiman to general manager/EVP of Basketball Operations.

The lead-up to this season

Taylor Jenkins was hired as the Grizzlies' head coach in 2019. Weeks later the team picked Ja Morant out of Murray State with the second overall pick in the draft.

After the 2019-20 season was paused due to COVID-19 the team was invited to play in the last eight games of the regular season in the NBA Bubble in Orlando. They finished as the 9th seed in the Western Conference falling in a play-in game against the Portland Trail Blazers.

Morant who averaged 17.8 points and 7.3 assists during his rookie campaign became the first Grizzlies player since Pau Gasol in 2001-02 to win the Rookie of the Year award. He received 99 of the 100 first-place votes with the only other vote going to Zion Williamson the Associated Press reported.

Behind a 38-34 record in the condensed 2020-21 season the Grizzlies qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 2016-17 beating the Golden State Warriors in the play-in round. However the Grizzlies lost to the Utah Jazz in five games.

During the 2021-22 season the Grizzlies hit several franchise records including setting a league record for the largest margin of victory against the Oklahoma City Thunder having Morant be the first Grizzlies player to be named an All-Star Game starter and tying a franchise record for regular-season wins with 56.

Their 56-26 2021-22 regular season record was the second-best in the NBA.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZkaWdlc3QuY29tL3N0b3J5L3ByaXplLW1vbmV5LXBheW91dC1wdXJzZS13ZWxscy1mYXJnby1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAtMjAyMtIBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZkaWdlc3QuY29tL3N0b3J5L3ByaXplLW1vbmV5LXBheW91dC1wdXJzZS13ZWxscy1mYXJnby1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAtMjAyMi9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Prize money payout for each player at the 2022 Wells Fargo Championship,The disappointing finish for Bradley came with one potential perk.

The first Ford E-Transit will be delivered this month and once all enter service the DPD UK fleet will have over 2500 electric vehicles.

According to the press release the company has ordered the 3.5t long-wheelbase version with 12.4 cubic meters of load space and a 135 kW electric motor. The battery pack is 68 kWh (usable).

On top of fleet electrification DPD says that it also invests in a series of innovative recycling and circular economy initiatives to become ""the greenest delivery company on the planet.""

Olly Craughan Head of Sustainability DPD UK commented:

""Getting our hands on the electric Ford Transit feels like a really big moment. 3.5t vans are the workhorse of any delivery fleet and we are no different. We’ve said all along that we need the main commercial van manufacturers to step-up with affordable models and largescale production of right-hand drive vans to really get the EV revolution going in the UK. And Ford have done just that. The E-Transit is well priced has a good range and comes with all the support you would expect from Ford.""

DPD is not the only high-profile customer that placed a volume order for the Ford E-Transit in the UK as DHL Express announced the rollout of 270 units in March (vehicles will enter operation between May and September).

In the case of DHL Express the order includes a 4.25t version with a payload of approximately 1000 kg (2205 lbs) and a range of 140 miles (225 km).

Considering the strong position of Ford in the commercial vehicle segment in Europe its all-electric vehicles soon might be a big counterweight to the comprehensive EV fleet offered by Stellantis' Peugeot/Citroën/Opel/Vauxhall.

The diesel fuel made its way to Long Island Sound where NRFD set up booms to trap the oil. See below for full update on the oil spill with video and photos.

The incident occurred on the New England Thruway between the Center Avenue Bridge and Crescent Avenue behind the Bread Factory on Grove Avenue.

All Southbound lanes were blocked with traffic at a standstill for over an hour. Vehicles were backed up for miles. A heavy smell of diesel permeated the area.

New Rochelle Fire Fighters and New York State Police responded to the major accident scene after a call shortly before 6:30 am.

A passenger in the car a black four-door BMW sedan was injured and taken by ambulance to an area hospital said Sandor.

A tandem FedEx tractor trailer truck that had stopped to assist the jackknifed Fedex tractor trailer had already left the scene by the time this reporter arrived.

UPDATE: 7:38 AM: The right lane has re-opened. Expect delays and consider alternate routes. traffic moving slowly oil still making road surface slippery. Sand truck operating. Firefighters still on scene.

UPDATE: 8:45 AM: All lanes open.

OIL SPILL UPDATE 9:45 AM: The New Rochelle Fire Department located the storm drain outlet where diesel fuel from the crash on I-95 emptied into a channel leading out to Long Island Sound. NRFD set up booms at the outlet near Evans Street and Sutton Manor about three-quarters of a mile from the crash scene. The U.S. Coast Guard was summoned by NRFD. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation was notified.

Talk of the Sound transcript of interview of New Rochelle Fire Chief Andrew Sandor follows:

Interview Transcript

TOTS: Tell me about the truck crash. SANDOR: We got toned out this morning about 6:30 for a tractor trailer that had jackknifed on 95 got involved with one other passenger vehicle. The person in the passenger vehicle did get injured and they were transported by ambulance. The truck driver was not injured. Another truck driver had actually stopped to help him a tandem FedEx truck and was not involved in the accident however because of all the fuel spill from the saddle tanks from the first truck…he couldn’t go anywhere because the surface was slick and so we had to put down SafeStep like kitty litter to help him get traction and get out there. TOTS: And no injuries for your guys or state police? SANDOR: No injuries for fire or state police or anybody. No. TOTS: And then the fuel got into the storm drain and then it makes its way to the Sound? SANDOR: Yeah this has happened to us before where we have incidents on 95 that’s how we knew to come to…first…we checked because it was further along on 95 we thought it might come out by Pelham Road it usually comes out by 666 Pelham Road there’s a low spot right there where it goes out behind Glen Island over there and also check here because this has happened before and sure enough it was coming out down here at Evans Street. TOTS: Any idea how much you’re talking with those tanks? SANDOR: Those tanks are usually about one to two hundred gallons of diesel. TOTS: And then what do you have set up here? What are you trying to accomplish here? SANDOR: Well we have set up here as a boom system and what it does because the oil is lighter than water it stays up on top of the water you can put the booms on top and it’ll contain the oil to a degree and we do have the Coast Guard was summoned and they should be responding. TOTS: They’re going to bring the boats out here on the… SANDOR: Yeah well I would reckon they’d have some kind of response out here. They have been notified. We did notify DEP DEC as per protocol. TOTS: For folks who don’t know the area so this little inlet or outlet here actually goes all the way out to Long Island Sound. SANDOR: Yes it does. There’s a storm drain that comes from all over New Rochelle including from 95 the water washes out into Long Island Sound. This is off Main Street in New Rochelle where we are right now by the intersection of Echo Avenue and Main by Taco Bell and the housing projects by 365 Main. And behind us is Sutton Manor Road as you go along. Pelham the start of Pelham Road right here. That’s where we’re at. TOTS: Okay good. Thank you very much.

EDITOR’S NOTE: This story has been updated. The original report from BNN (Breaking News Network a wire service for scanner radio traffic) was of a major accident involving two tractor trailers and a car. Based on being on scene and our interview (above) with New Rochelle Fire Chief Andrew Sandor the story was corrected to say the incident involved one tractor trailer and a car. The second tractor trailer stopped to assist got stuck in the oil on the roadway and was assisted in leaving the scene. BNN posted an alert at 7:22 am but Sandor said about 6:30 am and 511NY.com sent an alert at 6:21 am.

Kolkata: Power distribution company CESC Ltd on Friday said it has commissioned its first microgrid with floating solar and Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) on a trial basis in South 24 Parganas district a model that will help in crisis management and uninterrupted power supply with green energy. Microgrid is like a small grid within a grid which is connected to a large single customer or a small group of consumers and typically has renewable generation source with a battery backup to support supply when the normal grid fails. This helps in maintaining an uninterrupted and quality power supply for essential services improving the overall resiliency of the grid.""This microgrid plant with 100kW floating solar system and 218kWh with battery storage is in place now for trial and we will study and analyse for a year before deciding to expand the model in other locations within our distribution area"" CESC MD (Distribution) Debasish U Banerjee told PTI.The study and analysis of the performance of this small microgrid trial project will provide valuable insights for scaling up this technology to reap maximum benefits for our consumers in future the official said.During the daytime the microgrid will supply local load of the substation sourcing green power from the floating solar plant covering 6000 sq ft. Any excess generation will be utilized to charge the battery bank and export it to the grid.In case of grid failure (arising out of generation/import failure) natural disasters etc the microgrid will isolate itself from the disturbances and provide uninterrupted power to the local substation load.CESC had installed a 315KW storage battery at Kakurgachi with grid fed power that charges with off-peak power and supports the grid during peak hour.The battery in the microgrid uses the latest Gel type technology propelling a higher level of efficiency and safety.""In our constant endeavour to adopt sustainable technology we have embarked upon installation of microgrid in Kolkata to further enhance reliability of power supply and pursue the journey of decarbonisation decentralization and disaster management. This cutting-edge technology will accelerate powering a sustainable future to create a positive societal impact for a better planet and its people"" Banerjee said.CESC officials declined to speak about microgrid capex and unit power cost.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXBsZXNuZXdzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS8yMDIyLzA1LzA3L3RvbGwtYnJvdGhlcnMtYW5ub3VuY2VzLW5ldy13YXRlcnZpZXctbGFuZGluZy1jb21tdW5pdHktY29taW5nLXNvb24tYmFiY29jay1yYW5jaC85NjI5ODk4MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Toll Brothers Announces New Waterview Landing Community Coming Soon to Babcock Ranch,"Toll Brothers

Over the course of roughly the past week News 5 has covered at least three events that involved balloon releases. And as the weather gets warmer those with FirstEnergy told News 5 they’ll see more events like these popping up and that can mean more power outages.

According to FirstEnergy last year foil balloons caused more than 150 power outages across their service area including two dozen in Northeast Ohio.

“Many people just don’t realize that releasing them outdoors can cause significant damage to our power infrastructure” Lauren Siburkis with FirstEnergy said.

Earlier this year Cleveland City Council passed an ordinance banning the release of ten or more balloons at a time following in the steps of other cities such as Toledo.

Cleveland holds a special place in history when it comes to balloon releases.

News 5 Archives Balloonfest '86

In 1986 a world-record-setting attempt of 1.5 million balloons released lives on in infamy as an event meant to raise awareness that instead caused all sorts of problems including littering the lake temporarily shutting down Burke Airport and making it harder for the Coast Guard in a search for two missing boaters.

And from an environmental standpoint those at local animal rehab facilities told News 5 it can be very difficult if not impossible to save an animal such as a bird when it eats a balloon or gets tied up in it.

“Usually if there has been a very large balloon release it is after that we will see animals having difficulty with balloons” Heather Merritt with Birds in Flight Sanctuary in Trumbull County said. “You would have to do surgery to try to take it out or go in orally to get it out. Usually if you have to do surgery to get them out it usually is not successful.”

Between 2016 and 2018 more than 18000 balloons or balloon pieces were collected during alliance of the Great Lakes beach clean-up events.

Balloon releases have impact on Lake Erie expert says

Instead those looking to do a balloon release are asked to look at alternative ways to celebrate such as planting a tree lighting candles safely or releasing butterflies.

“Do you really want to memorialize someone by taking a life?” said Annette Piechowski with Medina Raptor Center. “There’s so many more viable things you can do that won’t affect the environment. Please don’t release balloons at any cost.”

Hosted by Milwaukee’s 102.9 The Hog Hog Fest 2022 brought their listeners’ favorite acts to Milwaukee for a night of great music featuring performances from Lilith Czar Wage War Asking Alexandria Three Days Grace and Godsmack the evening’s headlining act.

Check out some of our favorite images from Hog Fest 2022 last night at Fiserv Forum:

1. Highway to Hell

Although they were just one of several acts to perform at Hog Fest 2022 the night’s headlining act Godsmack still delivered a big 15-track set for their Milwaukee fans on Friday night. And while they performed a career-spanning set with a number of their biggest hits including “I Stand Alone” and “Voodoo"" they finished the night with an encore performance of AC/DC’s classic 1979 hit ""Highway To Hell.""

2. Ask and you shall receive

Milwaukee has been asking for a massive rock show since concerts have returned and the Danny Worsnop-led Asking Alexandria helped deliver with their supporting performance at Hog Fest. The British metalcore band opened with “Alone Again” and closed with “Alone in a Room” but were far from alone as thousands of rock fans sang along throughout the performance.

3. Blame Canada

If you had the time of your life at the Fiserv Forum last night you can likely blame Canadian rock band Three Days Grace. The Ontario natives have been winning over audiences since even before their 2003 self-titled debut and on Friday they brought unmatched levels of energy to the big stage with a 10-track set which was preceded by an intro featuring a Wisconsin favorite: House of Pain’s “Jump Around.""

4. Czar’s palace

Fiserv Forum was Lilith Czar’s palace as the Bay Area native kicked off Hog Fest 2022 with a few songs to warm up the crowd. Czar who placed second on season two of ""The Voice"" in 2011 of course knows how to perform a killer cover and she did so on Friday night with her version of Stevie Nicks’ classic record “Edge of Seventeen."" Czar closed her six-track performance with her debut album’s lead single ""Anarchy.""

5. Ayyyyyyy!

Godsmack’s Sully Erna clearly loves Milwaukee as much as Milwaukee loves Godsmack as he’s seen here rating Friday night’s crowd while also doing an impression of his favorite Happy Days character.

6. Milwaukee rocks

As evidenced from the fans rocking out at the barricade all night long Milwaukee is a rock city – and fans can’t wait for Hog Fest to hopefully return to Fiserv Forum in 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vYnVja3MvdmlkZW9zL2dpYW5uaXMtYW50ZXRva291bm1wby00Mi1wb2ludHMtdnMtY2VsdGljcy1nYW1lLTMtZWFzdC1zZW1pZmluYWxzLTUtNy0yMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Giannis Antetokounmpo 42 Points vs. Celtics | Game 3 East Semifinals | 5.7.22,"Copyright © 2024 NBA Media Ventures LLC.

He was posing for pictures and shaking hands as people arrived for Garding Against Cancer’s gala Saturday the fifth time the event has been held.

People were decked out in pastels funky hats and seersucker as a bluegrass band played for the Kentucky Derby themed gala. Gard was wearing a seersucker suit lined with pictures of former winning horses. His bow tie had a horse on it too.

It’s an event that’s special to Gard because it brings together many people who have supported the cancer fighting initiative since its inception. Gard and his wife Michelle started the foundation to honor Gard’s father Glen. who died in 2015 after a six-month battle with brain cancer.

This year it holds even more meaning because his mother Connie was diagnosed with breast cancer earlier in the year.

“I think the emotional investment that people have made into it and because everybody that's on our committee has a personal tie to it has been impacted in some way shape or form … then you watch that kind of just grow into the attendees” Gard said. “They're all driven by a personal purpose and have a story and want to help in any way they can.”

This is the first time the gala has been held in person since before the COVID-19 pandemic. Garding Against Cancer has raised almost $6 million in five years. Members of the initiative hoped to surpass that benchmark Saturday.

Attendees watched the Bucks game the actual Kentucky Derby and mingled with each other before heading to the Kohl Center floor. There they had dinner heard from guest speakers such as Charlie Berens an Emmy winning journalist and comedian and finished the night with a concert.

They raised $800000 at the gala to put Garding Against Cancer's total over $6.5 million raised.

Ford is reportedly one of the companies that will be selling part of its stake according to Seeking Alpha quoting a CNBC report.

Ford plans to dump 8 million of its 102 million share stake according to the report.

Rivian Automotive shares have fallen since its successful initial public offering in November.

Rivian went public on Nov. 10 at $78 a share. Shares even rose as high as $179 a few days later.

Shares closed recently at $28.79 down 84% from the high.

Since rolling into showrooms in 1990 the Explorer has been at the vanguard of the movement that took American families out of cars and into sport utility vehicles. Initially modeled on Ford's compact Ranger pickup the Explorer debuted with best-in-class interior volume and up to six seats.

Indeed in many ways Explorer's history is emblematic of how that market has grown and developed. In its first three years Ford sold nearly three-quarters of a million. More power more luxury – an Eddie Bauer version – and more capability such as full-time all-wheel drive followed. Seeing the public's enthusiastic reception Ford quickly developed a larger more powerful version based on the F-150 pickup.

In 2011 Explorer abandoned truck-like body-on-frame construction for a more carlike unibody platform thus putting Explorer dead center in the crossover SUV market that now dominates the American market.

Troubled past

On the plus side the Explorer has been a leader in innovation and family safety. It was the first to offer a center-mounted taillight and standard rear antilock brakes. On the downside Explorer has had a series of embarrassments. Most notable was a finger-pointing fiasco with Firestone over tire failures that killed 148 people and injured 525 in some 3000 rollover accidents.

There also has been a seemingly never-ending list of mechanical failures. Transmission problems paint and body failures and a host of under-the-hood bugaboos continued the give Explorer a lousy reputation for durability. Indeed 253000 2020-2022 models were recalled last week because a design flaw can allow the vehicle to roll away even while in park.

It was the second recall for the latest generation Explorer new in 2020. In February the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recalled 18366 Explorers and Lincoln Aviators because a fuel filler tube could detach and cause a fire.

Critics pan it

Indeed reliability issues are cited by virtually every major rating service none of which puts Explorer in the top tier of a crowded market niche. Consumer Reports for example rates Explorer 13th among 14 midsize SUVs giving it a score of 47. The top-rated Kia Telluride which sells for thousands of dollars less scored 97. The top-selling Toyota Highlander rated an 88.

The Hyundai Palisade (87) Mazda CX-9 (84) and Chevrolet Traverse (83) rounded out the top five. Traverse CR? Seriously? Not the Toyota Venza Honda Pilot or Nissan Murano?

Car and Driver rated the Explorer 12th out of 24 midsize SUVs. In a separate evaluation C&D noted that the Explorer finished at the bottom on the skidpad and in the slalom. There was good news for all those police officers who work in Explorers every day: It has the best brakes.

U.S. News and World Report which combines the reviews of dozens of automotive journalists puts Explorer 16th of 22 vehicles in its class.

You can check them all – I also recommend Kelly Blue Book and Edmunds.com – and you will see some real differences in opinion. Most auto writers are men who tenaciously cling to their teen identities and are smitten with big-block high-output engines; thus the hopelessly outdated fuel-guzzling Dodge Durango occasionally cracks the top 10 and the button-downed conservative Highlander occasionally does not.

No there there

But the Explorer never does and there is widespread agreement about that with everyone but buyers.

When first I drove our tester an XLT with a premium options group and sport appearance package I took note of the chintzy interior materials (been a long time since I've seen a rat-fuzz headliner) the uninspired handling the below-average ride and the hard flat seats and the general lack of refinement.

I also noted the growly engine and uncertain transmission. My instinct is to be fair and I thought ""Well OK. Perhaps this is a budget model.""

Then I opened the window sticker. $45305. As the kids say OMG!

Let me carefully step-by-step and with all due consideration evaluate the value proposition here. No.

Our tester came with come 13000 miles on it. Under even moderate acceleration it felt like and sounded like a three-year-old rental car.

Of course auto critics are hardly the final judge of these things. Explorers continue to record strong sales. In the first quarter of 2022 despite supply-chain issues that for a time shut down production Explorer was second in sales to only the Highlander.

At 63537 units Explorer outsold Telluride by a more than 2:1 margin according to goodcarbadcar.

Change is coming

Full disclosure: I happen to own a few shares of Ford stock but I am not saying these things because I am mad about losing so much money last week. On the contrary I think Ford is a smart long play and I am impressed that in the short-term CEO Jim Farley is maximizing profit from internal-combustion engine stock while transforming Ford into an electric-car maker.

Not completely electric one hastens to add. In March Farley split Ford into two units: ""Ford Blue"" to handle conventional drivetrains and ""Ford Model e"" for the electric side. It's not like he's hedging his bets. Ford also operates an extensive commercial truck business as well as selling heavy-duty pickups. The mass and workload of larger vehicles make it difficult to build electric versions with acceptable range capacity.

Remaking a company that can do both is painful. While Ford is pouring billions into building factories and forming partnerships to build chips and batteries it is also reducing investments and headcounts in other areas. Last week it announced it was terminating more than 500 engineers. In the meantime it is in Silicone Valley recruiting new talent.

""I kind of was watching the management team struggle with this transformation"" Farley said in a public appearance in March. ""From 7 to 8 they were working on chip supply from 9 to 10 they were trying to find lithium and nickel from 10 to 11 they were working back on emission control for a Super Duty"" he said. ""You just can't ask people to do that many different things.""

A new Explorer is not something left for the new kids to design. Ford has an electric Explorer and Lincoln Aviator nearly ready for production. In December however it put those plans on hold saying it needed the capacity at its Cuautitlán plant in Mexico home of the soldout Mustang Mach-E. In April the Mach-E reached a new sales record and Ford said it plans to sell 200000 units a year by 2023.

The Explorer and Aviator are to enter production at a yet to be determined location in December 2024 Ford said in a memo to suppliers. Ford also recently began production of the Mach-E in China.

Perhaps by the time it finally rolls out the new Explorer the public will be ready to accept an e-version.

So why not freeze Rupert Murdoch’s assets?,"If the west could find the courage it would order an immediate freeze of Rupert Murdoch’s assets. His Fox News presenters and Russia’s propagandists are so intermeshed that separating the two is as impossible as unbaking a cake.

On Russian state news as on Fox bawling ideologues scream threats then whine about their victimhood as they incite anger and self-pity in equal measures. Its arguments range from the appropriation of anti-fascism by Greater Russian imperialists – the 40 countries supporting Ukraine were “today’s collective Hitler” viewers were told last week – to the apocalyptic delirium of the boss of RT (Russia Today) Margarita Simonyan. Nuclear war is my “horror” she shuddered “but we will go to heaven while they will simply croak”.

Russia would never give genuine western journalists airtime. But it can always find a slot for its favourite quisling: Fox News’s Tucker Carlson. He pushes out Russian propaganda lines or perhaps creates his own lies for Russia to use. Ukraine not Russia is the real tyranny. Nato provoked poor Vladimir Putin. The west is plotting to use biological weapons. Last week he floated the theory that the war was not the result of an unprovoked invasion by a colonialist dictatorship but of the Biden administration’s desire to avenge Donald Trump’s victory in 2016.

It was a big hit in Moscow reported BuzzFeed’s Julia Davis. “State TV propagandists loved it so much Russia’s 60 Minutes included it not once but twice in their evening broadcast – neatly bookended by the Kremlin’s war propaganda.”

Putin’s appeal to both the far right and the Chomskyan wing of the far left in Europe and North America is worthy of a study in itself. He was a dream for ultra-reactionaries: a white Christian strongman who was anti-liberal and anti-EU. His victories heralded a world in which might was right and morality was for losers.

In Europe Russia’s atrocities have forced everyone from Arron Banks and Nigel Farage to Marine Le Pen and Matteo Salvini to find urgent reasons to change the subject. In the US there remains a market for Putinism among a large minority of Republican voters. Their yearning for dictatorship as evidenced by the support given to denying legitimate election results and to the fascistic forces that stormed Congress is greater. The hatred of liberals in power is deeper.

Murdoch is boosting Russian morale and conversely undermining Ukrainian resolve by supplying a dictatorship with foreign validation. Do not underestimate its importance. Russians who suspect their TV anchors are state-sponsored bootlickers are more likely to believe foreign commentators who assure them that the lies they are hearing are true. Reporters risk their lives but Putin cannot fire or imprison Fox News presenters steal their wealth or poison them with Novichok. Russian forces will not reduce their towns to rubble rape them torture them burn them alive in theatres or shoot them in the head by the side of forest roads. Murdoch and his employees have nothing to fear from Putin. Their endorsement of Kremlin war propaganda carries conviction because it is freely given.

Murdoch boosts Russian morale and undermines Ukrainian resolve by supplying a dictatorship with foreign validation

As useful to Russia is the wider chilling effect. I have seen journalists start off making eloquent and plausible critiques of the left’s hatred of free speech for instance or its tolerance of regressive religion only to find that careers in the worst of the rightwing media come with a price tag. To succeed on Fox News in the US they don’t have to agree with banning abortion or denying climate change but they must never make their objections public.

The UK’s sanctions regulations include among the reasons for freezing an oligarch’s assets “obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia”. The Biden White House promises to punish those “responsible for providing the support necessary to underpin Putin’s war on Ukraine”. On both interpretations there is a plausible prosecution case for freezing the assets of Murdoch’s NewsCorp.

Because it is a media conglomerate sanctions would be an attack on free speech. I say this plainly because so many writers and political actors pretend that they are not demanding censorship when that is precisely what they are doing. Nevertheless in this case the threat to freedom is minimal. Murdoch would not be punished for revealing embarrassing truths about the west but for spreading demonstrable lies for a hostile foreign power.

If you still feel queasy imagine if Murdoch’s media organisation were exactly as it is today and producing the same arguments the Kremlin uses to justify its crimes. The one difference is that Murdoch is Russian rather than Australian. I don’t believe there would be the slightest hesitation in removing him and his family from control of their businesses. Indeed the UK EU and US have already announced sanctions against Russian broadcasters and individual journalists. I have not heard anyone claim that they are attacking press freedom rather than trying to cripple the propaganda capacity of a warmongering state.

The Murdoch empire contains the Times and Wall Street Journal whose Russian coverage has been admirable and HarperCollins which with a bravery few other publishers would match fought off a vicious legal assault by the Russian oligarchy and their pet London lawyers against a critical study of Putin’s power.

But good deeds count for nothing in assessing the desirability of sanctions. The tycoon Oleg Tinkov spoke for many rich Russians when he denounced the “massacre” in Ukraine and called for an end to the “crazy war”. The oligarchs the west has sanctioned are losing their fortunes and what little influence they had. Of course they hate Putin’s strategy. Western governments don’t care because as Tom Keatinge of the Royal United Services Institute explains it to me they know that a large portion of oligarchical wealth is at Putin’s disposal. Their private thoughts and when they dare risk assassination attempts public protests are irrelevant. The need to end war in Europe comes first.

Tender-hearted readers may object that Murdoch is now 90 and may well not be in full control of his organisation. But surely this is an argument for removing him? If in his dotage he is allowing himself to become a cross between Lord Haw Haw and Tokyo Rose it would be a kindness for western governments to save him from himself.

Two highlights are rare Mint marked halves from 1921: A 1921-D Walking Liberty half dollar graded Mint State 65+ and a 1921-S half dollar in MS-65 both graded by PCGS and with green CAC stickers.

The former enjoys a status as the lowest mintage Walking Liberty half dollar in the series with 208000 issued and it is the key date in lower grades. Q. David Bowers wrote in the Guide Book of Mercury Dimes Standing Liberty Quarters and Walking Liberty Half Dollars that most Mint State examples “are quite well-struck but cherrypicking will result in finding examples with better head hand and feather definition.” The 1921-D Walking Liberty half dollar closes on May 22.

Closing on May 29 is Fox’s exceptional 1921-S half dollar with a mintage of 548000.

Bowers explained “Traditionally the 1921-S was considered to be the rarest and most valuable variety in the series but in later years the 1919-S has taken over that position due to published population reports.”

The Fox example shows a bolder than typical strike and booming luster with a slight golden tone.

Heritage called the issue the “King of the Walkers” when it offered another MS-65+ example also with a green CAC example as part of the Steven L. Duckor Collection at the January 2018 Florida United Numismatists auctions where it realized $120000. That cataloger explained “It is thought that somehow this issue escaped the attention of contemporary dealers and collectors and was not saved in significant numbers at the time of striking. Perhaps this was because so few people were interested in or able to save coins during the economic decline that followed World War I.”

Two top 1940 half dollars

Beyond the keys in the series the collection has some wonderful later issues in top grades including a duo of 1940 issues from the Philadelphia Mint.

The circulation strike representative graded MS-68 has a green CAC sticker and copper color at the rims which transitions to milky golden iridescence across the fields that will be offered on May 22. This one is uncommonly fine and is one of the top graded examples in the entire series.

The Philadelphia Mint also struck Proof half dollars for collectors that year and perhaps the most visually intriguing coin in the Fox collection is the 1940 half dollar graded Proof 68+ with a green CAC sticker that is characterized by otherworldly neon blue green and purple colors that are especially dynamic on the obverse. The unique color identifies it as the example that sold at a June 17 2021 Heritage auction for $19200. There the cataloger observed “The coin is sharp throughout complementing the deep reflectivity of the fields with no sign of surface contact” adding “Lovely champagne and iridescent toning graces each side.” It is one of five certified by PCGS in this grade with none finer.

Beauregard Electric Cooperative Inc. has joined with four other electricity providers to create a new power-buying coalition that will begin executing contracts in the year 2025.

BECi joins Claiborne Electric Cooperative Northeast Louisiana Power Cooperative South Louisiana Electric Cooperative Association and Washington – St. Tammany Electric Cooperative Inc. in what is being named the 1803 Electric Cooperative. Combined the cooperatives represent more than 120000 consumers in Louisiana.

According to Beauregard Electric General Manager Kevin Turner the cooperatives “pooled their power supply needs” in creating the new alliance that he said is projected to save the member distribution cooperatives about $40 million a year when compared to existing contracts.

“With the changing face of modern power procurement comes challenges to the way electric cooperatives secure the power their member owners need. BECi chose to meet these challenges by uniting with four other Louisiana cooperatives to form 1803 Electric Cooperative. By uniting the five cooperatives created a larger more attractive power demand to facilitate more participation from large-scale power brokers” Turner said in a release printed in Beauregard Electric’s recent newsletter to members.

Named for the year of the Louisiana Purchase the new cooperative will be comprised of a board of directors consisting of the five cooperative managers and one board member from each of the five cooperatives according to Turner. The move was approved by the Louisiana Public Service Commission in January.

BECi VP of Marketing and Member Services Kay Fox said the move to become part of a larger organization to seek out power suppliers will not change Beauregard Electric’s name or local operations.

“We are still Beauregard Electric; we are not going anywhere. We have been here since 1939 and we are only getting larger and stronger so this doesn’t change anything for us” Fox said.

Fox said that as BECi officials searched for ways to find a better deal at a reduced rate for its members they soon learned that there was strength in size.

By seeking out vendors and contracts as part of a larger organization with more members Fox said BECi was able to obtain more competitive rates.

She said officials are anticipating a 10 to 15 percent rate decrease for members starting in 2025 after the current contract with Cleco Cajun expires and the new contracts are put into action. At that time the 1803 Cooperative will execute six agreements that will include a solar power contract with Bayou Galion that was just approved this month by the Public Service Commission.

Bayou Galion will provide power from its future 98-megawatt solar farm in northeast Louisiana. The solar farm will be located on 1000 acres of land in Morehouse Parish and construction is projected to begin next year. It is expected to power more than 18000 homes annually and offset the equivalent of 170 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year.

Also within its portfolio of vendors will be other solar providers including Bayou Tech Solar LLC in St. Mary Parish and Bayou Chico Solar LLC in Evangeline Parish who will provide 245 megawatts combined.

Another agreement will tap a future highly efficient combined-cycle gas turbine generator to be constructed by Kindle Energy LLC and owned and operated by Magnolia Power in Iberville Parish that is expected to provide around 409 megawatts of power.

Other providers include Exelon for 27 percent of the load established by the new cooperative’s members to provide 270 megawatts and an option for energy during peak periods from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. if needed from Calpine to total 185 megawatts.

The 1803 Electric Cooperative’s portfolio also includes a U.S. government hydro allocation through the Southwest Power Administration for about 36 megawatts.

All contracts are for 20 years except for the Calpine and Exelon agreements which are for five years.

Turner said the 1803 cooperative received nearly 200 vendor offers before selecting the power providers “through complex analysis”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2NhZXNhcnMtc3Bpbm9mZi12aWNpLWNsb3Nlcy1vbi1iaWctdmVnYXMtc3RyaXAtcHJvcGVydHktZGVhbNIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2NhZXNhcnMtc3Bpbm9mZi12aWNpLWNsb3Nlcy1vbi1iaWctdmVnYXMtc3RyaXAtcHJvcGVydHktZGVhbC5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Caesars spinoff VICI closes on big Vegas Strip property deal,"A big casino landlord closed its acquisition of MGM Resorts International’s real estate spinoff giving the buyer several more hotel properties on the Strip.

Caesars Entertainment spinoff VICI Properties said April 29 that it completed its $17.2 billion buyout of MGM Growth Properties the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. The deal was first announced last August and included the assumption of about $5.7 billion of debt.

As part of the sale VICI acquired several MGM Resorts-operated properties along Las Vegas Boulevard including Mandalay Bay MGM Grand The Mirage Park MGM New York-New York Luxor and Excalibur.

It also picked up several other casino properties outside Nevada including MGM Grand Detroit and MGM National Harbor near Washington D.C.

All told VICI is slated to receive more than $1 billion in initial annual rent from the newly acquired properties the firm indicated.

The buyout likely won’t result in noticeable changes at the resorts anytime soon as VICI does not operate the properties but rather collects rent from the companies that do.

CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT REBRANDS BALLY'S AS HORSESHOE LAS VEGAS

Still it easily ranks among the largest real estate sales the Strip has ever seen and significantly expands VICI’s holdings in the famed casino corridor making the New York company one of the biggest property owners on Las Vegas Boulevard.

VICI now owns 10 resorts on the Strip totaling almost 41000 hotel rooms 1.2 million square feet of casino space and 5.9 million square feet of meeting and convention space company President and Chief Operating Officer John Payne said in a news release.

Company CEO Ed Pitoniak said the deal makes VICI the largest owner of hotel and conference real estate in America.

MGM Resorts which spun off MGM Growth in 2016 and was its controlling shareholder received about $4.4 billion in cash as part of the VICI buyout according to a company news release.

Operations at MGM Resorts-run properties now owned by VICI ""will continue as before for guests and employees"" MGM spokesman Brian Ahern told the Review-Journal.

NEVADA REGULATORS OK COMPANY BUYING CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT

MGM will use proceeds from the deal to invest in its ""core business"" President and CEO Bill Hornbuckle said in a May 2 earnings call adding the company would also ""continue to seek meaningful growth opportunities.""

MGM announced it is offering $607 million to buy LeoVegas a Swedish online gaming firm. It also is in the process of buying the operations side of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas for more than $1.6 billion; will begin spending on a new resort in Osaka Japan later this year; and plans to build a 1000-room resort in the United Arab Emirates.

VICI was spun off from Caesars Entertainment in 2017 as the casino chain’s main operating unit emerged from bankruptcy. By the end of that year VICI’s real estate holdings on the Strip consisted of Caesars Palace and Harrah’s a securities filing shows.

VICI was already in the process of growing its portfolio on Las Vegas Boulevard before the MGM Growth buyout was unveiled.

Casino operator Las Vegas Sands Corp. announced in March 2021 that it was selling its properties on the Strip — The Venetian Palazzo and former Sands Expo and Convention Center — for about $6.25 billion to VICI and investment giant Apollo Global Management.

Under the transaction which closed in February VICI acquired the real estate for $4 billion. Apollo acquired the operations side for $2.25 billion and leased the former Sands sites from VICI.

Since its formation VICI has completed about $29.5 billion of mergers and acquisitions and other investment activity general counsel Samantha Sacks Gallagher said in a recent news release."

So why not freeze Rupert Murdoch’s assets?,"If the west could find the courage it would order an immediate freeze of Rupert Murdoch’s assets. His Fox News presenters and Russia’s propagandists are so intermeshed that separating the two is as impossible as unbaking a cake.

On Russian state news as on Fox bawling ideologues scream threats then whine about their victimhood as they incite anger and self-pity in equal measures. Its arguments range from the appropriation of anti-fascism by Greater Russian imperialists – the 40 countries supporting Ukraine were “today’s collective Hitler” viewers were told last week – to the apocalyptic delirium of the boss of RT (Russia Today) Margarita Simonyan. Nuclear war is my “horror” she shuddered “but we will go to heaven while they will simply croak”.

Russia would never give genuine western journalists airtime. But it can always find a slot for its favourite quisling: Fox News’s Tucker Carlson. He pushes out Russian propaganda lines or perhaps creates his own lies for Russia to use. Ukraine not Russia is the real tyranny. Nato provoked poor Vladimir Putin. The west is plotting to use biological weapons. Last week he floated the theory that the war was not the result of an unprovoked invasion by a colonialist dictatorship but of the Biden administration’s desire to avenge Donald Trump’s victory in 2016.

It was a big hit in Moscow reported BuzzFeed’s Julia Davis. “State TV propagandists loved it so much Russia’s 60 Minutes included it not once but twice in their evening broadcast – neatly bookended by the Kremlin’s war propaganda.”

Putin’s appeal to both the far right and the Chomskyan wing of the far left in Europe and North America is worthy of a study in itself. He was a dream for ultra-reactionaries: a white Christian strongman who was anti-liberal and anti-EU. His victories heralded a world in which might was right and morality was for losers.

In Europe Russia’s atrocities have forced everyone from Arron Banks and Nigel Farage to Marine Le Pen and Matteo Salvini to find urgent reasons to change the subject. In the US there remains a market for Putinism among a large minority of Republican voters. Their yearning for dictatorship as evidenced by the support given to denying legitimate election results and to the fascistic forces that stormed Congress is greater. The hatred of liberals in power is deeper.

Murdoch is boosting Russian morale and conversely undermining Ukrainian resolve by supplying a dictatorship with foreign validation. Do not underestimate its importance. Russians who suspect their TV anchors are state-sponsored bootlickers are more likely to believe foreign commentators who assure them that the lies they are hearing are true. Reporters risk their lives but Putin cannot fire or imprison Fox News presenters steal their wealth or poison them with Novichok. Russian forces will not reduce their towns to rubble rape them torture them burn them alive in theatres or shoot them in the head by the side of forest roads. Murdoch and his employees have nothing to fear from Putin. Their endorsement of Kremlin war propaganda carries conviction because it is freely given.

Murdoch boosts Russian morale and undermines Ukrainian resolve by supplying a dictatorship with foreign validation

As useful to Russia is the wider chilling effect. I have seen journalists start off making eloquent and plausible critiques of the left’s hatred of free speech for instance or its tolerance of regressive religion only to find that careers in the worst of the rightwing media come with a price tag. To succeed on Fox News in the US they don’t have to agree with banning abortion or denying climate change but they must never make their objections public.

The UK’s sanctions regulations include among the reasons for freezing an oligarch’s assets “obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia”. The Biden White House promises to punish those “responsible for providing the support necessary to underpin Putin’s war on Ukraine”. On both interpretations there is a plausible prosecution case for freezing the assets of Murdoch’s NewsCorp.

Because it is a media conglomerate sanctions would be an attack on free speech. I say this plainly because so many writers and political actors pretend that they are not demanding censorship when that is precisely what they are doing. Nevertheless in this case the threat to freedom is minimal. Murdoch would not be punished for revealing embarrassing truths about the west but for spreading demonstrable lies for a hostile foreign power.

If you still feel queasy imagine if Murdoch’s media organisation were exactly as it is today and producing the same arguments the Kremlin uses to justify its crimes. The one difference is that Murdoch is Russian rather than Australian. I don’t believe there would be the slightest hesitation in removing him and his family from control of their businesses. Indeed the UK EU and US have already announced sanctions against Russian broadcasters and individual journalists. I have not heard anyone claim that they are attacking press freedom rather than trying to cripple the propaganda capacity of a warmongering state.

The Murdoch empire contains the Times and Wall Street Journal whose Russian coverage has been admirable and HarperCollins which with a bravery few other publishers would match fought off a vicious legal assault by the Russian oligarchy and their pet London lawyers against a critical study of Putin’s power.

But good deeds count for nothing in assessing the desirability of sanctions. The tycoon Oleg Tinkov spoke for many rich Russians when he denounced the “massacre” in Ukraine and called for an end to the “crazy war”. The oligarchs the west has sanctioned are losing their fortunes and what little influence they had. Of course they hate Putin’s strategy. Western governments don’t care because as Tom Keatinge of the Royal United Services Institute explains it to me they know that a large portion of oligarchical wealth is at Putin’s disposal. Their private thoughts and when they dare risk assassination attempts public protests are irrelevant. The need to end war in Europe comes first.

Tender-hearted readers may object that Murdoch is now 90 and may well not be in full control of his organisation. But surely this is an argument for removing him? If in his dotage he is allowing himself to become a cross between Lord Haw Haw and Tokyo Rose it would be a kindness for western governments to save him from himself.

VICI was already in the process of growing its portfolio on Las Vegas Boulevard before the MGM Growth buyout was unveiled.

Casino operator Las Vegas Sands Corp. announced in March 2021 that it was selling its properties on the Strip — The Venetian Palazzo and former Sands Expo and Convention Center — for about $6.25 billion to VICI and investment giant Apollo Global Management.

Under the transaction which closed in February VICI acquired the real estate for $4 billion. Apollo acquired the operations side for $2.25 billion and leased the former Sands sites from VICI.

Since its formation VICI has completed about $29.5 billion of mergers and acquisitions and other investment activity general counsel Samantha Sacks Gallagher said in a recent news release."

While TLS has included the Forerunner 955 the leaked Forerunner 955 Solar is nowhere to be seen. Still Garmin has four versions of the Forerunner 255 on the way.

The Singapore Telecom Licensing System (TLS) has offered some insight into the state of upcoming Garmin smartwatches. While the company has already released several smartwatches this year most recently with the Quatix 7 series it is also expected to reveal successors to the Forerunner 245 and Forerunner 945. Incidentally Garmin is rumoured to have developed the Venu Sq 2 and the Vivomove trend too.

Not only has TLS listed the Forerunner 255 it has also listed the Forerunner 255s confirming earlier leaks. Reportedly the Forerunner 255 will arrive with a 47 mm case 5 mm larger than the 42 mm diameter that the Forerunner 255s is thought to offer. Unsurprisingly TLS reports that the Forerunner 255 series supports ANT+ Bluetooth and GPS; we doubt that Garmin will release LTE versions of either smartwatch though. Moreover the agency has added dedicated 'Music' versions as the Forerunner 255 Music and Forerunner 255s Music respectively. Based on other Garmin 'Music' smartwatches the Forerunner 255 Music and Forerunner 255s Music should feature more storage than their non-Music siblings along with Wi-Fi connectivity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2hvbWUvaG93LWFjY3VyYXRlLXNsZWVwLXRyYWNrZXJzL9IBQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2hvbWUvaG93LWFjY3VyYXRlLXNsZWVwLXRyYWNrZXJzLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Sandman wars or how accurate are sleep trackers?,"In 2018 the CDC classified sleep disorders as a public health epidemic.

A lot of people suffer from insomnia or other issues that make sleeping difficult for them. Just as many people simply don’t get enough sleep each night and find themselves tired throughout the day. To tell the truth I’m one of them — I know I don’t get enough sleep and I’ve been working to change that.

Recommended Videos

Part of that process involved a deep dive into sleep trackers. For several weeks now I’ve used the Nest Hub’s Sleep Sensing feature worn a Garmin Epix almost every hour of every day and used an iPhone app to track my sleep patterns. I wanted to see how accurate each device was as well as which device was the most feasible.

This experiment came on the heels of a study on how sleep tracking actually worked in which I spoke with several experts.

The setup

The tests consisted of three devices:

Garmin Epix smartwatch

Nest Hub 2nd Gen

SleepWatch iPhone app

I also tried to employ a smart bed in the process but the one I used did not have sleep tracking (and the previous smart bed I had no longer functions without leaking thanks to my cat).

Both the Garmin Epix and the Nest Hub automatically track sleep with zero input on my end. Nest’s Sleep Sensing uses Motion Sense and tracks the presence of a person in front of the display activating when someone is in the correct position.

The Garmin Epix monitors changes in breathing and heart rate to determine when you transition into sleep.

The iPhone app on the other hand requires manual activation. I have to tell it when I’m laying down to sleep and then I have to disable it when I wake up. While this does require more manual input it’s also a good indicator of when I lay down and when I get up but not the amount of time actually spent in one of the four sleep stages.

The results

Day Garmin Epix Nest Hub SleepWatch May 1 5h 38m 2h 20m 4h 25m May 2 7h 33m 5h 19m 5h 50m May 3 7h 9m 5h 32m No data May 4 5h 24m 1h 38m 6h 20m May 5 5h 4m 2h 14m 6h

From the outset there’s a disparity in the results — particularly with the Nest Hub. It’s for one simple reason: the device is tethered to the bed. Both the app and the Garmin Epix travel with me if I wake up and move to another room but the Nest Hub does not.

That said I remained in bed all night on May 4 yet there is still a huge gap in the time I supposedly slept. I’m not sure why that happened except that I might have moved my cup of water in front of the sensor without thinking.

If you get out of bed during the night it can skew the Nest Hub’s results.

Of all of these results I suspect the Garmin Epix is the most accurate. Garmin has a feature called the “Body Battery” that calculates your relative energy levels at any given time based on how well you slept and how much you exerted yourself during the day. I found it to be accurate most of the time; when I felt more energized the battery showed a high score. When I was tired at the end of the day the battery was also low.

The practical considerations

The reasons the Nest Hub is so far off from the rest of the results isn’t because it’s faulty. It’s because the Nest Hub uses Soli radar to measure miniscule movements of your breathing your heart rate and more. If you aren’t in front of the sensor it doesn’t record.

As someone struggling with insomnia I often get out of bed if I can’t sleep. Few things are as frustrating as laying in a dark room with nothing to do — boredom becomes the enemy. I’ll typically get up and watch TV or read in the living room until I fall back asleep on the couch.

The Garmin Epix and the SleepWatch app both move with me but the Nest Hub does not. In my particular use case they’re the better options. However the average person who spends most of the night in bed (where sleep is the highest quality) will see much better and more accurate results from the Nest Hub.

Feedback

A valuable trait of the Garmin Epix and the Nest Hub is that both suggest solutions to poor-quality sleep. The Garmin Epix tracks a number of other vital measurements including stress. If you go to bed with a high-stress level it can interfere with your sleep. The Epix will suggest that you try to de-stress and unwind before bed or it might suggest an earlier bedtime if you went to bed too late.

The Nest Hub is not as detailed but it compares your sleep quality against previous instances and will tell you whether you slept for more or less time and whether you were restless or not.

So which device was most effective? That’s hard to say. For me a wearable is the best fit for the reasons stated above — but it’s often better to get multiple data points and compare them. If you are serious about tracking your sleep use a wearable device and a smart bed. If you have a Nest Hub capable of Sleep Sensing take advantage of it.

Over time you’ll gain a better understanding of how long it takes you to fall asleep and your usual sleep cycles. Bear in mind that none of this data is clinical; no home device compares to the level of accuracy found for example in sleep study facilities. However it’s also important to understand that sleep is an inexact science. Think of tracking your sleep a bit like horseshoes: Pretty much on target is sufficient.

(WBAY/Gray News) - A pet owner in Wisconsin is explaining her decision to leave her dog left tied to a fire hydrant in Green Bay last weekend.

After a picture of her dog “Baby girl” went viral she said she wanted to share her side of the story.

WBAY reported the owner wanted to remain anonymous because of the story’s nationwide attention and she fears backlash from her decision.

The woman admitted that leaving her dog at the fire hydrant was the hardest thing she’s ever had to do but at the time it was her last resort and only option.

“It was the worst. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life but I knew she would be OK. Somebody would pick her up and she’d be safe” she said.

Currently she said she’s living on the street and going through chemotherapy making it impossible for her to care for her “Baby girl properly.”

“I was on the streets with her and I said it needs to be done because she’s with me outside under bushes. And I was told no one had any kennels” she explained.

The dog owner said she then tried working with other humane societies and going door-to-door to find someone to take the dog and ended up taking advice to call the police for an emergency surrender.

“I called seven places. I called everybody to see if I could give her up” she said.

The woman said she was just a block away watching as her dog got picked up by police. She had left the dog with her favorite toys food and a note explaining the situation.

“When I put her at the hydrant I saw her face that she was like ‘Mom what’s going on here?’” she said.

Now she’s hoping her “Baby girl” can find a good home and that people will understand she tried to do the right thing.

“I hope she finds a fantastic family. She deserves it. Just forgive me and bless her. Make sure she’s OK” she said.

The Wisconsin Humane Society Green Bay said they had no record of a conversation with the dog owner.

“We have no record of such a conversation. Although we ask for a surrender appointment to best prepare for an animal’s arrival we make exceptions for emergencies and definitely would if someone expressed that they were homeless. In fact it happened with another client this week” a spokesperson for the shelter said.

On Friday the humane society reported that “Baby girl” was happy healthy and quickly becoming a staff favorite.

The larger companies would pledge to help train workers at these SMEs to make the products and help develop common development and certification standards for “additive manufacturing” otherwise known as 3D printing.

Dubbed “Additive Manufacturing Forward” or “AM Forward” the initiative involves voluntary commitments from some of America’s largest manufacturers including aerospace giant GE Aviation and leading defence contractor Raytheon to source more 3D printed parts from smaller companies.

US President Joe Biden‘s administration announced on Friday a new initiative that would boost manufacturing of 3D printed products by domestic small- and medium-enterprises (SMEs) an effort that the White House hopes will work in conjunction with legislation meant to boost US competitiveness against China.

At an event attended by executives from some of America’s largest manufacturers Biden touted the potential 3D printing has to offer economically and from a national security perspective.

“The executives here today have agreed to launch a new compact between large iconic manufacturers and smaller American suppliers a commitment by these large companies to help those smaller ones adapt new technologies so we can continue to be the leading exporter of aircrafts and engines in areas like medical devices clean energy technologies and so much more” he said.

While Biden’s policies have diverged from the priorities of his immediate predecessor former president Donald Trump particularly on social issues and the environment he has so far kept hard-line policies on China intact including efforts to reduce American reliance on manufacturing in the country.

The US leader also reiterated a call for Congress to speed up passage of legislation that would provide billions of US dollars in funding for domestic semiconductor manufacturing and other provisions meant to counter China.

“We were ranked number one in the world in [research and development] three decades ago” Biden said. “Now we’re ranked number nine in the world. China was number eight in the world 30 years ago. Now they’re number two in the world. We’ve got to up our game.”

What the White House refers to as the Bipartisan Innovation Act is what will emerge from Congress assuming that the House of Representatives and the Senate manage to agree on provisions in China-related bills that each chamber has already passed.

The House passed its America Competes Act in February last year and the Senate passed its US Innovation and Competition Act four months later.

Provisions for 3D printing in USICA are part of some US$23 billion worth of funding that the bill would allocate for the development of high-tech priorities including aeronautics and space technology.

“Advanced materials and manufacturing processes including additive manufacturing to reduce the cost of manufacturing scale-up and certification for use in general aviation commercial aviation and military aeronautics” are called for under the heading of “experimental aircraft projects”.

In-situ additive manufacturing shows up in the legislation under the “Mars-forward technologies” heading along with other technologies including nuclear propulsion and cryogenic fluid management.

As part of AM Forward GE Aviation will target SME suppliers to compete on 50 per cent of its requests for products made using 3D printing or related technologies and will target 30 per cent of its total external sourcing of additively manufactured parts from domestic SMEs according to the White House fact sheet.

Lockheed Martin another participant in the initiative will work with its SME suppliers to conduct research to improve the performance of additive manufacturing AM techniques specifically focused on the use of 3D printing as an alternative to the manufacture of products through the more traditional use of castings and forgings it said.

Honeywell and Siemens Energy are also among the inaugural participants in AM Forward.

In a report on 3D printing prepared for US lawmakers in 2019 the Congressional Research Service — Congress’s public policy research arm — noted that 3D printing can be faster cheaper and more flexible than conventional production methods given 3D printers’ lower prices easily modifiable digital designs and ability to integrate multiple distinct manufacturing processes into a single operation.

The White House pledged support for AM Forward SMEs involved in the initiative through federal programmes.

For example the Small Business Administration would extend loans and Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) programme “can support the widespread deployment of new additive capabilities across US industry” it said.

DHgate a Chinese cross-border business-to-business e-commerce platform is doubling down on the fast-growing social commerce sector which means a person's entire shopping experience－from product discovery to the check-out process－takes place on a social media platform as part of its broader push to accelerate the digital transformation of traditional global trade.

China's Generation Z consumers those born between the mid-1990s and the early 2010s have shown a rising demand for personalized niche and intelligent products said Diane Wang founder chairperson and CEO of DHgate adding the company attaches great importance to the purchasing power of the younger generation.

According to her the sales of intelligent equipment such as robot vacuum cleaners scooters and wearable devices via the online platform of DHgate surged more than 200 percent year-on-year in 2021.

Gen Z accounts for one-third of the global population becoming the largest generation group in the world said a survey conducted by data.ai a US-based mobile analytics company. Their strong willingness to consume is leading the global consumption trend and bringing great changes to global trade.

""As for the booming social commerce segment we aim to help Chinese manufacturers brands and small and medium-sized enterprises access global private domain channels as well as empower Gen-Zers and content creators including internet celebrities key opinion consumers and brand owners""Wang said.

The global social commerce industry is expected to grow three times as fast as traditional e-commerce to $1.2 trillion by 2025 said global consultancy Accenture. The growth is predicted to be driven primarily by Gen Z and millennial social media users accounting for 62 percent of global social commerce spending by 2025.

DHgate is exploring new possibilities in the cross-border e-commerce industry driven by social media. It launched MyyShop a social commerce software-as-a-service or SaaS platform in 2020 which connects Chinese supply chains with people owning substantial private domain traffic or influencers on social networking platforms worldwide.

Myyshop also provides social media-based services such as artificial intelligence-powered smart product selection and smart logistics services and helps micro small and medium-sized enterprises especially entry-level merchants and individuals with social influence run their online stores as direct sellers.

Wang said the relationship between production and consumption in the global trade and the global supply chain is being reshaped in the social commerce era. ""Everyone can participate with a much lower entrance level including small and micro-entrepreneurs and social media creators.""

She added the number of active users on MyyShop increased 76.3 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of this year while the number of paying users rose 65.6 percent year-on-year with the gross merchandise value or GMV skyrocketing by 845.5 percent on a yearly basis.

""Currently MyyShop works with more than 50 000 influencers and content creators worldwide. Our goal is to reach 500000 influencers and content creators across the globe this year"" Wang said.

Social commerce empowers smaller brands and individuals and makes big brands reevaluate their relevance for a marketplace of millions of individuals said Oliver Wright global consumer goods and services lead at Accenture.

Being engaged in the social commerce sector means working together within a dynamic ecosystem of platforms marketplaces social media and influencers to share data insights and capabilities to deliver the right incentives and best consumer experience across an integrated digital marketplace Wright added.

Founded in 2004 DHgate serves more than 2.4 million registered suppliers and over 46.6 million registered buyers covering 223 countries and regions around the world with more than 100 international logistics routes and over 10 overseas warehouses.

Located in the northeast of Barcelona in the municipality of Sant Adrià de Besòs the land parcel has the capacity to house 15MW of total installed IT power. Construction of the first facility known as BCN1 is expected to commence in 2022 with completion anticipated in 2024.

Jan-Pieter Anten joint managing director EMEA at Interxion said: “The Mediterranean has established itself as one of the main points of interconnectivity between Europe and the rest of the world through its highly connected network of subsea cables. This move represents a critical step forward in expanding PlatformDIGITAL coverage further supporting our customers in deploying their critical services around the world as the need for data-driven services continues to ramp up globally.”

Robert Assink managing director Interxion Spain added: “Our planned BCN1 data center and connectivity hub further strengthens the position of Spain as the primary Southern Europe digital hub.”

The company currently operates three data centers in Spain all in the capital city Madrid. A fourth facility is also in development in the city that will offer 35000 sqm (376700 sq ft) of colo space and 34MW of capacity.

2022 has seen Interxion break ground on a new facility in Brussels Belgium and complete the first building on a new campus in Paris France.

If you look closely at their specifications most of them use the current top-end Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip. Reviewers and ordinary users complain about this SoC due to overheating problems; and hope that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 Plus will heat up less.

So there is an assumption that the whole point is in the design of the chipset and its optimization by smartphone manufacturers. It is hoped that smartphone manufacturers will pay more attention to adapting the work of Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 because Qualcomm does not intend to change the architecture. According to the well-known insider Digital Chat Station work is underway on the successor to Snapdragon 8 Gen 1; and the cores in it will be located in three clusters according to the “1 + 3 + 4” scheme. They will offer one super-core of the Cortex X family three high-performance cores and a quartet of energy-efficient cores.

Snapdragon 8 Gen 2: specifications and who will produce it

They promise a new 5G Snapdragon X70 modem with a peak data download speed of 10 Gbps and an updated neural engine to accelerate the execution of operations sharpened by artificial intelligence and machine learning. Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 received the SM8550 model number and its announcement will take place at the end of this year. The production of the chip was entrusted to the Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC and presumably the processor will again be manufactured according to the standards of 4-nanometer technology.

The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 Plus SoC; which will appear in the new Samsung foldable smartphones will get a delay before entering the market.

Initially Qualcomm’s plan was to announce the platform in May but now there is a delay in dates. The source says the final decision will come out in the second half of the year. These are very vague dates but the Galaxy Z Flip4 and Fold4 will launch in late August or early September; so Qualcomm’s new product should already be ready by that time.

The timing shift is due to the aggravation of the situation with the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Because of this factories are closed and the plans of many companies are violated. Recall that the first smartphone with the new Qualcomm SoC should be the Motorola Edge 30 Ultra. Considering that the Edge 30 Pro was the first to get the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1; this looks like a good bet.

We’re convinced that at least one high-ranking official militated for it at one point though it never happened. And with the electric cloud hovering above today’s car world we will never see an M7.

With that off our chest let’s move on to the rendering shared in the gallery above that came from superrenderscars on Instagram. The digital artist has imagined a BMW M7 in the hot CS flavor inspired by the smaller M5 CS. It is based on the new-gen 7 Series  and the result looks like a weird and interesting mix between an Alpina and a Hyundai.Side-by-side pictures provided by the pixel manipulator reveal the obvious changes that start with the green finish and yellow daytime running lights (yep those are the DRLs as the main clusters are positioned below them). A reinterpreted grille bedecked by the M logo and with bronze surrounds more aggressive side air intake in the redesigned bumper and reshaped central air intake are other novelties.If you look further back you will see that the side mirrors were digitally sourced from the M5 CS  too and it appears that the wheels came from the executive super sedan as well. Logic dictates that it would feature the same powertrain breathing air from behind the big grille which is a 4.4-liter V8 with twin turbocharging in case you forgot. The mill is hooked up to an automatic transmission and M-tuned rear-biased xDrive all-wheel drive system in the M5 CS.That beast of a sedan enjoys 626 hp and 553 lb-ft (750 Nm) of torque via the loud pedal and brags about doing the 0 to 60 mph (0-97 kph) sprint in just 2.9 seconds. A hypothetical M7 CS would be a bit slower since it would be bigger and much heavier but hey it won’t happen  so you can forget about it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL2JyYW5kZXF1aXR5LmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9hZHZlcnRpc2luZy9tb3RoZXJzLWRheS0yMDIyLXNiaS1nZW5lcmFsLWluc3VyYW5jZS11cmdlcy1wZW9wbGUtdG8tc2VjdXJlLXRoZWlyLW1vdGhlcnMtaGVhbHRoLzkxNDAwNTI10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mother's Day 2022: SBI General Insurance urges people to secure their mother's health ET BrandEquity,"Advt

GD,General Dynamics,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbW1vbmRyZWFtcy5vcmcvdmlld3MvMjAyMi8wNS8wNy9nZW5lcmFsLWR5bmFtaWNzLXNodXRzLW91dC1jcml0aWNzLXJhZGljYWwtc2tlcHRpY3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,General Dynamics Shuts Out Critics 'Radical Skeptics',"On May 4th General Dynamics held its annual shareholder meeting. This meeting took place virtually possibly in response to last year when shareholders were able to directly engage with the General Dynamics Board and ask how they justify the destruction and death their weapons cause.

CodePink co-founder Medea Benjamin was able to use her shareholder question last year to ask CEO Phoebe Novakovic how she justifies making $21 million a year while years earlier a 2000 lb. General Dynamics bomb hit a Yemeni marketplace and killed 97 civilians (including 25 children). This year's shareholder meeting was completely online with only audio broadcasted and no video shared no chat function and a question submission box that was disabled halfway through the meeting. This platform allowed General Dynamics to speed through the 24-minute meeting with no pushback criticism or engagement from the shareholder attendees - and this approach extended to the proposals section.

During this section there was a very notable proposal introduced by the Franciscan Sisters of Allegany NY requesting that the General Dynamics Board of Directors prepare a human rights report. The proposal points out that General Dynamics' products and services are used by Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates Bahrain Egypt Israel and U.S. government agencies at the U.S.-Mexico border. As General Dynamics' weapons are used in war crimes and human rights violations against Yemenis Palestinians asylum-seekers and beyond this proposal rightfully calls for General Dynamics to develop and provide transparency on their process to address and remedy the ""actual and potential human rights impacts associated with high-risk products and services.""

General Dynamics roundly rejected this proposal and unanimously recommended a vote against it. They stated that they already have a ""rational and principled"" human rights strategy - never mind that their strategy includes no commitment to addressing the human rights impacts of their lethal weapons. As Danaka Katovich lays out recently in Jacobin a 2019 Amnesty International report found that General Dynamics did not even measure up to its human rights due diligence responsibilities.

General Dynamics added that not only was this proposal unnecessary it was harmful and would ""undermine shareholder value"" by attempting to ""embed radical skepticism toward U.S. foreign policy."" In the shareholder meeting itself CEO Novakovic stated that ""we have supported the U.S. government's foreign policy and we will continue to do that--if that is at odds with anyone else's view that is something you should take up with your Representative. But that is not appropriate to ask at this meeting.""

General Dynamics' response to this human rights proposal painted a clear picture: a corporation that is just doing its job by supporting the policies and needs of the U.S. government. However the lobbying practices of General Dynamics and other top defense contractors paint a different picture.

General Dynamics is part of a proud defense contractor tradition of spending millions of dollars each year on lobbying to shape U.S. policy. And as Open Secrets points out this strategy pays off. Weapons manufacturers have spent more than $2.6 billion on lobbying in the past two decades and have been rewarded with ""half of the $14 trillion allocated to the Department of Defense (DOD) during that time."" For every $1 Lockheed Martin spent on lobbying in 2020 they received $5803 from DOD contracts.

General Dynamics' claim that their ""North Star is the law and policy of the U.S. government"" fails to mention that they spend millions annually to shape U.S. law and policy to their benefit. While defense contractors like General Dynamics hide behind the guise of supposedly impenetrable U.S. foreign policy they have already spent almost $2.9 million on lobbying efforts in the first quarter of this year alone.

It's time to stop buying the lie that corporate accountability for war crimes and human rights violations is really an attempt to ""embed radical skepticism toward U.S. foreign policy."" Defense contractors like General Dynamics may hide behind the veneer of serving the U.S. government but they ultimately only care about selling weapons and making substantial profits--and they shape our legislation towards that goal. It is against their self-interest to provide transparency around their human rights practices because the more weapons they sell the better--and they don't care who they sell them to.

That is why now is a critical time to focus on pulling money away from these weapon-manufacturing corporate behemoths. Divesting money from weapons manufacturers whether that is through divesting your church university or city budget not only pulls financial resources from these death-dealing corporations but also demonstrates to them that there are dissenting communities across the U.S. who do not believe their lies about ""just doing their jobs."" Pushing your Congressional representative to divest from war by refusing to take campaign contributions from weapons manufacturers is another powerful way to disrupt weapon manufacturers' manipulation of U.S. policy for their own profit.

Militarized violence across the world in Ukraine Yemen Myanmar Somalia and beyond is overwhelming--and so is the immense profit that weapons manufacturers are making from this violence. But we all have more power than we think and an important first step for building a demilitarized future is pulling away money--and power--from these weapons manufacturers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpvaW50LWZvcmNlcy5jb20vZGVmZW5jZS1lcXVpcG1lbnQtbmV3cy81MzcxOC1nZW5lcmFsLWR5bmFtaWNzLWF0LW1vZGVybi1kYXktbWFyaW5lLTIwMjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,General Dynamics at Modern Day Marine 2022,"General Dynamics is to demonstrate innovative solutions at Modern Day Marine 2022 in Washington DC from 10th to 12th May.

Its Quad 8 drone is described as a long-endurance vehicle that can offer a flight time of over 100 hours.Unlike untethered drones TAVs come with superior air endurance because they draw their power from a ground-based generator which means they can stay in the air for longer times. Quad 8 is a versatile user-friendly quadcopter with two motors and propellers on each of its four arms. It consists of the TAV itself a ground power unit and remote control. Zenith AeroTech claims the drone would be able to land even if it lost two of its motors. It weighs 24 lb (10.8 kg) and measures 46 x 46 x 23” (116 x 116 x 58.4 cm).But despite its small size this TAV claims to be in another class entirely being able to carry up to 20 pounds (9 kg) with the Quad 8 accepting a variety of payloads from combined electro-optical/infrared cameras to scanning radar LiDAR laser pointers and target designators and more. The drone can be used for various applications from inspection and security to public safety communications media and more.Zenith AeroTech boasts of the TAV having flown for 96 hours straight last year during an endurance test being supported throughout the demonstration by the Ground Power Unit which acts as a tether management system and converts available 120 or 240-volt AC power into high-voltage DC.In promoting its capable Quad 8 Zenith AeroTech teamed up with aerospace and defense company General Dynamics also based in Virginia. The TAV manufacturer recently announced that it plans to soon show the world its tethered drone for the first time. The Quad 8 as well as other products released by the manufacturer will be showcased at the SOFIC (Special Operations Forces Industry Conference) that is scheduled to take place between May 17 and May 19 in Tampa Florida. Those interested in taking a closer look at the tethered drone and its 60 lb (27 kg) tether management/power conversion unit can do so at the General Dynamics Mission Systems booth #805.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ib3N0b25nbG9iZS9uYW1lL21pY2hhZWwtaHVybGV5LW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM0Nzk0OTIy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MICHAEL HURLEY Obituary (2022) - Peabody MA - Boston Globe,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/bostonglobe/name/michael-hurley-obituary?id=34794922 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ib3N0b25nbG9iZS9uYW1lL21pY2hhZWwtaHVybGV5LW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM0Nzk0OTIy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

April had stopped off at Wawa this weekend and spotted this new coffee and after a quick text the order was in for mine which she brought home. Usually as of late my go-to at Wawa is their ""Cuban"" blend which is a dark roast. This new coffee she found is a medium roast.

Wawa is known throughout New Jersey and their coffee is a huge fan favorite. When we have asked you at home you tell us one of your favorite items at Wawa is their coffee and I agree it's very good ""real"" coffee.

Wawa has its own ""regular"" blend and decaf. Along with french vanilla and hazelnut all of these four are ""mild"". Their Columbian blend is their ""medium"" style. Their Cuban blend and dark roast are their ""dark"" blends.

So onto this new Wawa ""limited edition"" coffee it's one I don't think they have done before regardless I was ready to give it a try. April brought me home their new peanut butter fudge blend. It's a ""mild"" roast and yes folks are going nuts for it. Peanut butter coffee I was curious but not thinking I was gonna ""love"" it. I am not a big ""flavored"" coffee guy but wow this is good. It's not sweet it has hints of peanut butter fudge and vanilla and it is very nutty. I am totally enjoying this new coffee and will definitely be getting this again. April says it may be one of her favorites.

Kentucky Teacher

The 2022 Kentucky General Assembly adjourned April 14 after passing a biennial budget for 2022-2024 that includes significant increases for key areas of education. Local school boards and districts will also see changes as a result of other legislation passed with the most significant changes including House Bill (HB) 9 HB 277 HB 678 Senate Bill (SB) 1 and SB 9.

Signed bills will go into effect on July 14 2022 which is 90 days after the end of the 2022 regular legislative session. This date does not apply to bills with emergency clauses or delayed effective dates.

HB 1 sponsored by Rep. Jason Petrie makes significant increases in the state’s budget to P-12 education over the upcoming biennium including:

• Funding full-day kindergarten (approximately $125.9M);

• Increasing Support Education Excellence in Kentucky (SEEK) funding to $4100 in FY23 and $4200 in FY24;

• Additional funding for pupil and vocational education transportation;

• Additional funding for National Board Certified Teacher (NBCT) and speech language pathologist salary supplement;

• Record CTE funding and an additional $58000000 for Local Area Vocational Education Centers;

◦ $155600000 in FY23 for local area vocation education center renovation projects; and

◦ Step and rank increases for KY Tech (ATC) employees of $424000 and $444000;

• $18800000 to support an increase in the per eligible student amount from $183.86 to $210.00 for the Family Resource and Youth Service Centers;

• KY School for the Blind – $8091600 FY23 $8097800 FY24;

• KY School for the Deaf – $10876100 FY23 $10885800 FY24;

◦ Step and rank increases for both KSB and KSD of $534000 FY23 $549900 FY24;

• Salary Increases for:

◦ Certified and Classified Staff – Additional resources are made available to local school districts through an increase in the SEEK resources. The 2022 General Assembly encourages local school districts to provide certified and classified staff a salary or compensation increase; and

◦ State Employees – provides 8% base salary increment in FY23 on July 1 2022 no salary increment in FY24 however it is the intent of the General Assembly to provide a salary increment in fiscal year 2023-2024 subject to the completion of the classification and compensation report by the Personnel Cabinet.

HB 9 sponsored by Rep. Chad McCoy amends existing Kentucky charter school laws by providing state common school (SEEK) funds locally levied school funds and federal education funds to charter schools; amending charter school authorization requirements to require local school board endorsement as a condition of application for districts with 7500 students or less; and mandating a charter school pilot project in both Jefferson County and Northern Kentucky.

HB 9 also directs the KBE to promulgate administrative regulations to “govern the calculation and distribution of funds due to public charter schools from school districts the schedule of distribution of funds and the imposition of fines for late distribution of funds.”HB 9 became effective April 14 after the General Assembly overrode Governor Beshear’s veto and delivered it to Secretary of State Michael Adams.

HB 277 sponsored by Representative Walker Thomas amends KRS 161.048 to create a new expedited alternative certification pathway referred to as Option 9 through the use of a residency program. This new route will differ from the other eight options and be available to candidates who have not obtained a bachelor’s degree and will not allow for temporary or provisional certification while completing the route. Option 9 programs will have to be approved by the Education Professional Standards Board (EPSB).

HB 277 also authorizes any person receiving emergency teaching certification during the 2021-2022 school year be eligible to renew that certification during the 2022-2023 school year and was signed by the governor on April 8th.

HB 678 sponsored by Rep. Ed Massey sets up a two-year pilot project related to school construction that was requested by a group of school districts due to rising construction costs. District construction costs grow for various reasons from supply chain shortages to inflation. Additionally interest rates are also expected to increase. If costs increase while a school district is awaiting approval then projects become more expensive – possibly to a point that a project could become cost-prohibitive.

To speed up the process until June 30 2024 school districts that opt-in to the pilot project do not have to get approval from the Kentucky Department of Education (KDE) for the funding financing design construction renovationm or modification of school facilities. Districts also do not have to get KDE approval for the expenditure of capital funds.

Currently KDE reviews and approves district construction projects prior to the project beginning. Districts are still required to file BG-1 Project Application forms with the department and follow all other applicable laws and regulations.

HB 678 requires a local board that elects to conduct its projects under the provisions of the bill to adopt a resolution by majority vote and submit the resolution to KDE as notice. Districts that opt-in to the provisions of HB 678 are still required to receive KDE approval for District Facility Plans as well as for the acquisition of property and disposal of surplus property. Approval authority is given to the commissioner or designee rather than the Kentucky Board of Education (KBE) to avoid additional time required for the KBE to meet and approve these items. KDE has 30 business days to approve or deny the submission.

HB 678 became effective April 8 when it was signed by Governor Beshear.

SB 1 sponsored by Senator John Schickel moves principal selection and curriculum decisions from school councils to the superintendent. SB 1 embeds language from SB 138 also referred to as the Teaching American Principles Act. This act requires the incorporation of 24 fundamental American documents and speeches into the grade-level appropriate middle and high school Kentucky Academic Standards for Social Studies. Provisions for instruction on current controversial topics are also included.

While SB 1 does contain an emergency clause in Section 9 it only applies to Section 6 which addresses COVID-19 paid leave days which reads:

Beginning March 1 2022 through June 30 2022 each school district shall 1 grant an employee up to five days of paid leave due to the employee having an active 2 COVID-19 infection documented by a positive COVID-19 test. This leave shall be in 3 addition to any other leave provided by statute or board policy. Leave granted pursuant to 4 this subsection shall not accumulate or carry over beyond the 2021-2022 school year and 5 shall not be transferrable to any other classification of paid leave established by statute or 6 local school district policy.

SB 1 was delivered to Secretary Adams on April 13th after the General Assembly overrode the governor’s veto.

SB 9 referred to as the Read to Succeed Act sponsored by Sen. Stephen West and championed by Rep. James Tipton provides a multifaceted approach to improve reading outcomes for all students.

Due to the rapidly growing need for literacy acceleration SB 9 provides more students with assistance than what is possible under existing law such as those impacted under KRS 158.792 which allocates funds to the reading diagnostic and intervention grant also referred to as the Read to Achieve (RTA) grant. It is important to note that the RTA grant is not impacted by SB 9 and will remain fully funded to support students with Tier 2 and 3 accelerated learning needs. As part of this multifaceted approach KDE local schools and districts and postsecondary education preparation programs will each play a role creating systemic improvement in reading outcomes for students in grades K-3.

For sustainability KDE requested and the General Assembly approved $22 million dollars in the 2022-2024 biennial budget to implement statewide professional learning and the literacy coaching model as defined in the bill.

SB 9 became effective when it was signed by Governor Beshear on March 29.

GM,General Motors,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kdWtlY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjIvMDUvZHVrZS11bml2ZXJzaXR5LWNsYXNzLW9mLTIwMjItY29tbWVuY2VtZW50LXNwZWFrZXItbWFyeS1iYXJyYS1nZW5lcmFsLW1vdG9ycy1jZW8tZmFtaWx5LWxpZmUtbGVzc29ucy1ncmFkdWF0aW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'From the kitchen table': General Motors CEO Mary Barra emphasizes family life lessons in 2022 Commencement ...,"General Motors CEO Mary Barra shared five lessons from her childhood kitchen table in her Commencement address to the Class of 2022.

President Vincent Price introduced Barra the first woman to lead a major auto company as “a visionary leader” who is “no stranger to this Duke University community.” Barra received an honorary degree from Duke in 2018 is a member of the University’s Board of Trustees and a parent of two recent Duke graduates.

Barra began by joking that when Price asked her to speak her first thought was “Oh no not after John Legend.”

“He will be very tough to follow but I assure you I have absolutely no plans to sing today. That would not turn out well for either of us” Barra said.

Barra first emphasized the importance of family and the American dream to her life story. Her mother came from a large family with eight kids and grew up on a farm in Michigan during the Great Depression. Her father grew up in Minnesota in the iron range area and served during World War II. Afterwards he worked at General Motors for 39 years as a die maker.

“They both believed in the American dream—that if you worked hard enough got yourself an education believed in yourself you could achieve anything” she said. “They instilled it in me and my brother and I still believe it today.”

Barra said that when she thinks about her childhood many of her memories come from her kitchen table. After school and work her family would come together around the table and talk about their days. Often extended family and neighbors also dropped by Barra said. There was always room at the table.

“And while I didn’t realize it at the time those conversations were some of the most formative of my life—who I am as a person a wife a mother a friend and as a leader” she said.

Barra outlined five “fundamental” lessons she learned “from the kitchen table”—always do your best; find your purpose; listen to understand; be honest always; and include one more. Barra said that her first lesson to always do your best reflected her belief that “one important trait that distinguishes those who truly excel in life is hard work.” She recalled that her mother would always ask her if she had done the best she could when Barra was anxious about an exam. “That’s all that matters” her mother would say. While Barra found the question dismissive at first the older she got the more she found herself calling home to hear her mother’s words after a tough day.

“If you choose to do something do your best work hard. A degree from Duke will open doors and give you a boost...It is the amount of effort you put in that will enable you to accomplish more than you ever imagined"" Barra said.

She quoted former men’s basketball head coach Mike Krzyzewski: “Believe that loose ball you are chasing has your name on it.”

Barra’s second lesson to find one’s purpose stems from working at General Motors since she was 18 years old when she worked part-time. Her first job was as a quality inspector on the assembly line where she rotated through areas and met many people. There she saw the company and the world from various workers’ perspectives.

In 42 years Barra has risen through the ranks from executive assistant to the chairman to vice chairman in communications to CEO. Her “roots at General Motors deepened” and her “empathy for the incredible people who pour their heart and soul into the company grew.”

“I slowly started to connect with my purpose and I realized I had a role to play with people to help them be their best selves” she said. “Purpose is the answer to why. Always ask yourself why.”

She added that some might not have their life’s purpose figured out yet but for those who do she advised they “treat it as [their] north star. You may veer on occasion but always find your way back.”

Her third lesson from the kitchen table is to listen to understand in order to respect other people’s points of view. Barra explained that at one point her role at General Motors was leading global human resources an area she didn’t have much experience in. She began identifying areas that could be improved including a vacation program that allowed employees to buy four extra vacation days each year.

“My HR team told me it was a bad idea but I was convinced it was right. So I eliminated it the next day” she said. “All I can say is I nearly got eliminated myself.”

If she had listened to understand Barra said she would have heard from employees how important those four days were to manage their personal lives.

The story of her mistake brought Barra to her fourth lesson—be honest always. She emphasized the simultaneous importance and fragility of integrity.

“You will mess up. Will you run? Will you look the other way? Will you hope that they blame someone else or will you own it?”

Barra’s last lesson and what she said is the most important one is to include one more. She explained that when people would join at the kitchen table and there wasn’t enough food her mother would make tuna fish sandwiches. At times Barra was embarrassed that that was all they could offer.

But years later at her mother’s funeral her cousin began her eulogy by asking who had had a tuna fish sandwich at Barra’s mother’s house. Hands shot up Barra said and everyone was smiling.

“And that’s when I realized it had nothing to do with the tuna. When you were at my house you were going to talk people were going to listen you were going to laugh for sure. And you might cry either from sadness or happiness and you would be fed. Even if it was a tuna sandwich there was always room for one more” she said.

Barra concluded that although there’s “plenty to be worried about there are also so many reasons for hope” one of those being the progress on the “power of inclusion.”

“And you the next generation of leaders are driving that. You’re challenging assumptions and you’re pushing all of us to be better. I hope you never stop.”

She left graduates with one final piece of advice—to find their people create their own kitchen table and in doing so discover their own wisdom.

With or without controversies the EV1 was a pioneer of many technologies we take for granted in today’s electric vehicles.

The EV1 is the most famous electric vehicle project of the past century although it was not the first and it would not be the last. Even in modern times other EV projects preceded the EV1 efforts. GM started itsadventure with the Impact Experimental Prototype an EV concept introduced at the 1990 LA Auto Show. The Impact was received with great enthusiasm even by the California Air Resource Board (CARB). It was the moment when the CARB was carried away and mandated that all major carmakers that wanted to sell vehicles in California produce a zero-emission vehicle (ZEV).This was also the moment that potentially doomed the EV1’s future. Had CARB not issued such a mandate the car industry would’ve likely not fought against this rule. Who knows maybe the electric vehicles would’ve taken off a lot earlier without the backlash from the car industry. Either way the EV1 came to market in 1996 under the GM branding and was not made by one of the many brands under GM’s umbrella.Recounting the EV1’s story is beyond the scope of this article but we encourage you to read Benny Kirk’s excellent article about the EV1 rise and fall . What we’d like to point out is that GM despite its failed start in the EV race of today has made some great strides in the past. Conspiracy theories aside Rick Wagoner GM’s CEO at the time of EV1 cancelation admitted in 2006 that “axing the EV1 electric-car program and not putting the right resources into hybrids” was his worst decision during his tenure at GM.It was an opinion mirrored by GM’s R&D chief Larry Burns who said that GM could’ve had the Chevy Volt 10 years earlier “if he could’ve turned back the hands of time.” Two years later the big recession ensued with GM needing a bailout to avoid bankruptcy. GM’s failed EV struggle has at least determined Elon Musk start his Tesla venture as he declared back in 2017. At most the GM EV1 was the testbed for many technologies that come with today’s electric vehicles.The EV1 had the energy equivalent of about a half-gallon of gas stored in its 26 lead-acid propulsion batteries. Making ends meet with such a low level of energy storage promoted the development of some clever solutions. Among the most significant advancements that are in use today are the heat-pumpsystem low-resistance tires keyless ignition drive by wire and brake by wire and many others.The heat pump specifically allows an electric vehicle to heat and cool the interior or/and the battery without spending much of the battery. Instead the system scavenges the ambient heat and amplifies it in a very efficient way. Not all EVs today features a heat pump but those that do usually offer improved range and efficiency especially in cold-weather situations Regenerative braking is part of almost all vehicles today but it really shines in electric vehicles offering increased efficiency by storing the braking energy back into the battery. The GM EV1 featured two set levels for the regenerative braking selectable by a shift lever button. According to Gary Witzenburg of Car and Driver  who worked on the EV1 project as the manager of the Vehicle Test and Development department at GM’s Advanced Technology Vehicles the two-level design was chosen because of the legal issues with brake-light activation.The EV1 also introduced novel concepts (for the time) like the electrohydraulic power steering electric-defrosting windshield electric braking and parking brake tire-pressure sensing and the cabin temperature preconditioning that all EVs use today. Other technologies pioneered by the GM EV1 were later incorporated into other products like the inductive charging system  which is widely used in mobile phones and other gadgets today.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXRyb2l0bmV3cy5jb20vaW4tZGVwdGgvYnVzaW5lc3MvY29sdW1uaXN0cy9kYW5pZWwtaG93ZXMvMjAyMi8wNS8wOS9taWNoaWdhbi1sb3NpbmctcmFjZS1ldi1mYWN0b3JpZXMtZWxlY3RyaWMtdmVoaWNsZS1iYXR0ZXJ5LXBsYW50cy85NTg0MzQ0MDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Howes: Michigan losing race to win more EV factories,"Your subscription supports:

The movement to commercialization starts with the Hydrotec fuel cell lab and work areas in Pontiac that are three football fields large and neighbor other propulsion operations. It's here where teams collaborate to improve the technology that will be used to power larger modes of transportation from semis to trains free of emissions.

About 300 employees are working on Hydrotec GM's hydrogen fuel cell operation that aims to run like a startup while still being connected to the resources of America's largest automaker. The team has been working mostly behind the scenes for years to enhance this technology to offer another way toward a zero-emissions future -- one that fuels much faster and weighs significantly less than an electric battery.

But in the last year Hydrotec hasn't been so silent announcing deals with major trucking and locomotive companies. Hydrotec also is gearing up for higher-volume production at a plant in Brownstown Township Michigan.

The magnitude of this moment is not lost on Margarita Mann senior manager for the Hydrotec fuel cell business. She's been working on the technology for most of her career since she started at GM in 2007.

""It's just been exciting for me because we work here day in and day out but we don't realize how this is pioneering groundbreaking really"" she said. ""You know GM has been making cars for the last 100 years right but this is the first time ever that we're making a fuel cell. We don't take it for granted; we just keep on doing this work every day.""

'Not a one-trick pony'

GM has been working on fuel cells for decades and has done demonstrations but now those fuel cells developed with Honda Motor Co. will be sent into real-world applications. The automaker foresees both technologies as avenues to a zero-emissions future as it continues to make internal-combustion vehicles for at least the next decade.

""The adoption for hydrogen especially on the commercial side is advancing quicker than anyone expected"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said. ""It's an opportunity for GM to monetize this area ... it gives them an advantage and it's a multi-pronged approach.""

GM isn't alone in developing fuel cell technology. Stellantis NV last year in Europe began producing light-commercial vans that use hydrogen fuel cells and electric batteries to power the vehicles. The transatlantic automaker plans to import large versions of the vans to the United States starting in 2025. It has a heavy-duty hydrogen fuel cell truck in the works as well.

Last year Hydrotec said its fuel cells would be used on a fleet of Navistar Inc. manufactured trucks that will be piloted this year by J.B. Hunt Transport Inc. Wabtec Corp. then announced it would use fuel cell systems in its locomotives and Hydrotec signed a joint development agreement with Liebherr-Aerospace to work on a hydrogen fuel cell-based electrical power generation system for aircraft.

GM already has shown in its demos that a fuel cell system can power a normal consumer vehicle but the automaker recognizes fuel cells are better suited for larger applications.

""When you start trying to put heavy things ... liquids steel gravel on the big heavy haulers that's where you're going to find that there's a big challenge to try to go to electric if you don't also have hydrogen in the technology portfolio"" said Charlie Freese executive director of GM's global Hydrotec business. ""And so that's why we continued to put heavy investment into this all along because we saw that it was needed to really build out this overall portfolio.""

Freese GM's former executive director of diesel engineering took over the program in 2008. His predecessor Byron McCormick had led the program since 1997 and advised executives about the capabilities hydrogen fuel cells could provide.

""I thought it was very important technology for GM to have"" McCormick said. ""It is complementary to batteries it is not competitive with.""

Under McCormick the team developed a ""strong"" fuel cell technology and put it into Chevrolet Equinoxes for a demonstration called Project Driveway. When McCormick retired the technology was ready to be commercialized he said but the lack of hydrogen fueling infrastructure held it back.

While that infrastructure is still not prevalent GM is focused on providing fuel cell technology to applications with fixed routes. Meanwhile its new Ultium battery technology can be used across a variety of consumer vehicles.

""General Motors is in a beautiful spot because by doing both of these things they've got a portfolio of options they can balance ... General Motors is not a one-trick pony"" McCormick said. ""It can play the game all the way across the board.""

Inside the lab

Hydrotec's projects are moving forward with the fuel cell lab at the center of making that happen.

Here everything from the research and development on all the components of the cells up to pre-production including validation and durability testing builds is done for different applications.

""The lab itself is covering the full-value stream of development and engineering"" said Betty-Ann Young manager of fuel cell test and lab systems on a recent tour.

There's a section for single-cell testing and testing fuel cell stacks. The stack test area is where the electrode and a bipolar plate come together for the first time connecting the cells in the stack to create power.

""It is the heart of the fuel cell. It is where we are looking to improve performance and durability"" Young said. ""As we successfully get through those tests then we can scale it up and move through the lab.""

A group of employees from across the fuel cells team gather every day to see what's happening across the operation. Folks running the lab technicians test engineers product engineering teams and others work as an integrated team.

And what's developed and tested in this lab will go directly into what's built at the manufacturing joint venture operation Fuel Cell System Manufacturing LLC GM operates with Honda in Brownstown Township.

""It's what we call a learning loop here. We test the product we productionize it and we learn lessons we send product back to Betty-Ann she does the testing and all the diagnostic work"" said Suheb Haq president of Fuel Cells System Manufacturing during the tour.

Collaboration continues in the ink and coating room where the fuel cell electrode parts and manufacturing are developed. Those specialized on the process work with teams from R&D manufacturing and engineering design and product development for the electrodes.

The electrodes fuel cell systems and Hydrotec power cubes created and tested in Pontiac also will be made in Brownstown Township though GM hasn't said yet when that manufacturing operation will be open for production.

Employees at the lab in Pontiac provide information on their testing to the manufacturing operation and vice versa.

""We talk about no daylight there's no daylight between the manufacturing team the product engineering team and the operations team"" Young said. ""We are hand-in-hand developing part and process and furthering the technology quicker because of it.""

The build area of the lab is where the fuel cell stacks come together to build fuel cell systems and power cubes for various applications. This is the final stop before the fuel cell systems and power cubes are sent off to customers.

While the fuel cell organization acts like a startup it's also part of a much larger organization which is helpful for growth Haq said: ""Whatever issues we run to different experts within General Motors which gives us a competitive advantage because we've been building engines transmissions and batteries for a number of years and we can take those experiences and leverage them to accelerate the development of the fuel cell systems.""

That’s how Peter Staley described the time period between his HIV diagnosis in late 1985 and joining the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) in 1987.

Hosted by AIDS Resource at Penn College to talk about his new memoir “Never Silent” Staley fielded questions from Wes Chicko the practice/outreach manager and testing specialist at AIDS Resource’s State College office. The event was held at Penn College’s Professional Development Center.

As a 24-year-old “deeply closeted bond trader” Staley “was pretty unaware of the risks” associated with HIV he said.

It wasn’t until he watched the 1985 TV movie “An Early Frost” and his boyfriend at the time mentioned that his coughing sounded like that of the main character with HIV that Staley went to his “gay doctor.”

The HIV test was brand-new at the time and took about two weeks to return a result so Staley’s doctor had a trick: Most of his patients with HIV had low white blood cell counts. Sure enough Staley had a low white blood cell count.

He received the phone call while at work in the JP Morgan building.

So what did Staley do after receiving the news? He went to Disney World with his Dutch boyfriend. Granted the vacation had already been planned but Staley said that he likes to joke about it.

Just a few days later Staley came out to his family — during Thanksgiving no less. Staley said his family was very supportive of him.

Fast-forward about a year and a half Staley first heard of ACT UP after having a flyer shoved into his hands on the way to work. It seemed that everyone in his office received such flyers and it was the talk of the trading floor until the head bond trader made a startling remark about how he felt gay men with HIV which made a hush fall over the floor.

Staley soon joined ACT UP and didn’t look back.

He emphasized that while ACT UP realized that the systems at play in America would need to change drastically in the future the activists focused more on working within the current systems so they wouldn’t die.

As Staley put it it would be kind of difficult to “overthrow capitalism” when you’re dead from lack of treatment for a deadly disease.

The short horizon everyone faced forced ACT UP to be “intensely practical” Staley said.

One of ACT UP’s biggest goals was to petition Congress and the president to increase funding for the FDA — more funding meant more research into the virus itself and into drugs to combat it.

ACT UP worked on both the “outside” and the “inside”: Activists would pull stunts and organize protests outside of high-profile locations like the FDA headquarters while simultaneously organizing small group meetings with researchers and other “power brokers.”

One researcher ACT UP worked particularly closely with was Dr. Anthony Fauci currently serving as President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser.

In just his second year in ACT UP Staley sat down with the then-director of the FDA at the FDA headquarters — before he got arrested for essentially being catapulted onto the roof of the National Institutes of Health building in 1990 of course.

Though things were not all peaches and cream in ACT UP.

Staley said that different “camps” of ACT UP eventually “went to war.” Though Staley stressed that no act by any particular camp was done out of intentional malice some groups “didn’t do their homework” and instead started actively harming the movement.

This prompted Staley to start the Treatment Action Group (TAG) to continue the inside work while ACT UP continued its outside work.

Nowadays with HIV drugs that actually work Staley has his eyes set on a new target: prescription drug manufacturers and their sky-high prices.

He is the secretary of PrEP4All an organization focused on providing HIV prevention and treatment to anyone who needs it.

Staley is in the middle of a lawsuit launched against drugmaker Gilead Sciences and his team even convinced the former Trump administration to launch its own lawsuit against Gilead for its HIV drug prices.

When asked by Chicko if seeing “Staley v. Gilead” is daunting he laughed and said “Nah that’s cool.”

Staley said that he uses the print media today to further push Congress to act on drug pricing. He said that bombshell reporting from The New York Times and Washington Post on drug prices helps bring HIV treatment back into the spotlight.

“If AIDS activists have you in their sights don’t ignore them” Staley said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

SNC-Lavalin Inc. says it will pay Quebec nearly $30 million over three years to settle criminal bribery charges stemming from bridge work in Montreal.

The charges against SNC-Lavalin and SNC-Lavalin International are related to events that occurred between 1997 and 2004 in connection with the Jacques Cartier Bridge deck rehabilitation project between Montreal and Longueuil.

Negotiations with Quebec’s Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions (DPCP) began immediately after charges were filed on Sept. 23.

The RCMP had arrested the same day two former executives of SNC-Lavalin — Normand Morin and Kamal Francis former respective vice-presidents of SNC-Lavalin and SNC-Lavalin International.

He had admitted receiving $2.23 million in bribes from SNC-Lavalin in connection with the $128-million project to repair the bridge.

The remediation agreement will allow SNC-Lavalin to continue to do business with Quebec Canadian and foreign governments thereby reducing the negative consequences for the company’s employees retirees customers and shareholders.

Beer and liquor are plentiful at Globe Life Field. But just how much of it are Texas Rangers fans consuming in comparison to the rest of Major League Baseball?

Box Score News and nyonlinegambling.com sought to find out surveying more than 2000 fans to find out their drinking habits inside and outside of MLB stadiums.

Raymond Carlin III-USA TODAY Sports The Texas Flag Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports Dane Dunning Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports Taylor Hearn

The result? Rangers fans are middle of the road when it comes to in-game alcohol consumption but they seem to know how to pre-game.

The survey revealed that Rangers fans took in 2.48 drinks per game which was good for No. 19 in the rankings. No. 1 appropriately enough were Colorado Rockies fans who consume 3.09 drinks per game at Coors Field.

The survey also showed that Rangers fans spend on average $18.40 per game on alcohol.

The Rangers are just below the average consumption for the league (2.62) and just above the average spend per game ($18.13).

Now pre-game is another story. The group also surveyed fans’ drinking habits before the game and there the Rangers came out at No. 5 behind the Chicago White Sox the Minnesota Twins the Kansas City Royals and the Miami Marlins.

Rangers fans appear to be taking full advantage of the bar scene at nearby Texas Live! if these results are any indication.

If you do like drinking during Rangers games whether pre-game or during the game don’t worry. The Rangers return home on Tuesday to start a nine-game homestand that will feature the Kansas City Royals the Boston Red Sox and the Los Angeles Angels.

NEW YORK – Country star Mickey Gilley whose namesake Texas honky-tonk inspired the 1980 film “Urban Cowboy” and a nationwide wave of Western-themed nightspots has died. He was 86.

Gilley died Saturday in Branson Missouri where he helped run the Mickey Gilley Grand Shanghai Theatre. He had been performing as recently as last month but was in failing health over the past week.

“He passed peacefully with his family and close friends by his side” according a statement from Mickey Gilley Associates.

Gilley – cousin of rock ’n’ roll pioneer Jerry Lee Lewis – opened Gilley’s “the world’s largest honky tonk” in Pasadena Texas in the early 1970s. By mid-decade he was a successful club owner and had enjoyed his first commercial success with “Room Full of Roses.” He began turning out country hits regularly including “Window Up Above” “She’s Pulling Me Back Again” and the honky-tonk anthem “Don’t the Girls All Get Prettier at Closing Time.”

Overall he had 39 Top 10 country hits and 17 No. 1 songs. He received six Academy of Country Music Awards and also worked on occasion as an actor with appearances on “Murder She Wrote” “The Fall Guy” “Fantasy Island” and “The Dukes of Hazzard.”

“If I had one wish in life I would wish for more time” Gilley told The Associated Press in March 2001 as he celebrated his 65th birthday. Not that he’d do anything differently the singer said.

“I am doing exactly what I want to do. I play golf fly my airplane and perform at my theater in Branson Missouri” he said. “I love doing my show for the people.”

Meanwhile the giant nightspot’s attractions including its famed mechanical bull led to the 1980 film “Urban Cowboy” starring John Travolta and Debra Winger and regarded by many as a countrified version of Travolta’s 1977 disco smash “Saturday Night Fever.” The film inspired by Gilley’s club was based on an Esquire article by Aaron Latham about the relationship between two regulars at the club.

“I thank John Travolta every night before bed for keeping my career alive” Gilley told the AP in 2002. “It’s impossible to tell you how grateful I am for my involvement with ‘Urban Cowboy.’ That film had a huge impact on my career and still does.”

The soundtrack included such hits as Johnny Lee’s “Lookin' for Love” Boz Scaggs’ “Look What You’ve Done for Me” and Gilley’s “Stand by Me.” The movie turned the Pasadena club into an overnight tourist draw and popularized pearl snap shirts longneck beers the steel guitar and mechanical bulls across the country.

But the club shut down in 1989 after Gilley and his business partner Sherwood Cryer feuded about how to run the place. A fire destroyed it soon after.

An upscale version of the old Gilley’s nightclub opened in Dallas in 2003. In recent years Gilley moved to Branson.

He was married three times most recently to Cindy Loeb Gilley. He had four children three with his first wife Geraldine Garrett and one with his second Vivian McDonald.

A Natchez Mississippi native Gilley grew up poor learning boogie-woogie piano in Ferriday Louisiana alongside Lewis and fellow cousin Jimmy Swaggart the future evangelist. Like Lewis he would sneak into the windows of Louisiana clubs to listen to rhythm and blues. He moved to Houston to work construction but played the local club scene at night and recorded and toured for years before catching on in the 1970s.

Gilley had suffered health problems in recent years. He underwent brain surgery in August 2008 after specialists diagnosed hydrocephalus a condition characterized by an increase in fluid in the cranium. He had been suffering from short-term memory loss and credited the surgery with halting the onset of dementia.

He underwent more surgery in 2009 after he fell off a step forcing him to cancel scheduled performances in Branson. In 2018 he suffered a fractured ankle and fractured right shoulder in an automobile accident.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndkcmIuY29tL21pY2tleS1naWxsZXktYWNjZXB0cy10aGUtdHJpcGxlLWNyb3duLWF3YXJkLWF0LWFjbS1qcGVnL2ltYWdlXzQ5NWIwZWIyLWNlZTItMTFlYy05YjIwLWE3ZGU5ZjI4NjkwYi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mickey Gilley accepts the triple crown award at ACM.jpeg,"You have permission to edit this image.

Kurt Suzuki was placed on the injured list Saturday. While the team did not specify a reason Suzuki’s absence is ostensibly related to COVID-19 because he was replaced by Chad Wallach a catcher who is not on the 40-man roster. No corresponding 40-man roster move was made.

Suzuki the backup to Max Stassi is hitting .179 with one home run and four RBIs in 12 games.

Players can be placed on the COVID-19 injured list because they were exposed to the coronavirus or exhibit symptoms; a positive test is not required. For IL placements of any other reason the Angels would need to remove a player from the 40-man roster to make room for Wallach.

The Angels also optioned pitcher Jhonathan Diaz to Triple-A and selected the contract of reliever Kyle Barraclough. Diaz beat the Washington Nationals in his 2022 debut Friday working around trouble for five scoreless innings.

It’s possible Diaz could return soon. The Angels have an off-day Thursday which will enable them to deploy five starters (rather than the usual six) on regular rest until Saturday. A scheduled doubleheader that day in Oakland will allow for a 26th roster spot which the Angels can use to bring Diaz back from Triple-A for the day.

Diaz a 25-year-old left-hander from Venezuela still has a chance to supplant Jose Suarez a 24-year-old left-hander from Venezuela as the team’s sixth starter.

“I’d like to see somebody settle into that” role Manager Joe Maddon said.

Wallach 30 could be in the Angels’ lineup as early as Sunday. The Fullerton product has played 78 major league games over the last five seasons batting .207 with a .271 on-base percentage and .303 slugging percentage.

Barraclough 31 had a strong spring training but was struck with a bout of COVID-19 on or around April 10 he said. He was limited to three appearances at Triple-A Salt Lake and did not allow a run in any of them.

The Nationals briefly employed Barraclough during their 2019 championship series. Barraclough said he received a World Series ring despite being designated for assignment at midseason. He made his 2022 debut in the sixth inning against Washington and threw two scoreless innings allowing only a single to Juan Soto.

INJURY UPDATES

Griffin Canning said he threw 30 pitches in two “innings” of 15 pitches each off a mound Friday. He will face live hitters at Angel Stadium on Monday.

The right-hander who is recovering from a lower back injury said he is bouncing back better from his simulated outings after making some minor mechanical adjustments to lessen the load on his back.

“I feel like I’m back to being myself commanding my fastball how I want to” Canning said.

Canning will be built up as a starter and could begin pitching on an every-fifth-day schedule next week.

Austin Warren will undergo surgery Tuesday according to head athletic trainer Mike Frostad. The pitcher sustained a nasal fracture when he was struck by a stray ball hit in batting practice Tuesday in Boston. After surgery Warren will need a week of rest before he resumes baseball activities Frostad said.

Pitcher Jose Quijada (right oblique strain) played catch from up to 75 feet Frostad said.

Pitcher Archie Bradley (abdominal strain) is progressing faster than expected and could begin playing catch next week.

The United States is in a maternal health crisis.

Maternal mortality and morbidity rates across the country have increased steadily over the past 20 years even as rates in all other developed countries have decreased significantly.

New government data shows that US maternal deaths jumped by 14% during the first years of the pandemic to 861 in 2020 from 754 in 2019. The rate of maternal deaths for Black women in the US was nearly three times higher than it was for white women over that time frame.

Goldman Sachs wants to change that. Mahmee a six-year-old maternal healthcare startup has announced the closing of a $9.2 million Series A funding round led by Goldman’s Growth Equity Business.

High maternal mortality rates in the US especially among minority groups have “become a systemic issue and something that we’re not paying attention to” said Mahmee founder and CEO Melissa Hanna. “But we can also turn this around.”

The investment is part of Goldman Sachs’ One Million Black Women initiative a $10 billion commitment to narrow opportunity gaps for Black women over the next decade.

Mahmee which has also received funding from Serena Williams and Mark Cuban hopes to build the digital infrastructure needed to bring patients and providers together and make healthcare data widely available in an industry where it’s often siloed.

“The reality is that most of the records systems that we use to track health information on mothers and babies don’t talk to each other” said Hanna.

Mahmee creates a unified record for each patient that shows all the health data of a mother in one place. The service also offers access to a national network of community-based health providers including in-house nurses and care coordinators who provide live support seven days a week. The coordinators monitor health needs offer referrals to health professionals and assist with questions and concerns from expectant mothers.

The company also works directly with institutions by selling their nurse-led coordination programs to a number of health services medical groups and insurance companies. Mahmee currently has over 750 providers and organizations in its network in 44 states.

Well-coordinated care has been proven to lead to better health outcomes and fewer hospitalizations according to research published in the Annals of Family Medicine but US patients are more likely to encounter gaps in those services than patients who live in other high-income nations the study found.

“We’ve been able to create some lifesaving interventions and point out things that other people may have just overlooked by accident or lack of experience” Hanna said.

Since launching in 2016 Mahmee has served over 15000 women Hanna said and those patients are 10% less likely to have a C-section and 50% less likely to deliver prematurely.

“Disparities in accessing high-quality maternal and perinatal care contribute to poor health outcomes in underserved communities and substantial costs for the broader healthcare system” said Suzanne Gauron global head of Launch With GS a Goldman Sachs program that aims to increase access to capital for underrepresented entrepreneurs and investors.”We believe Mahmee is well positioned to improve the lives of mothers and babies by narrowing critical opportunity gaps in care and outcomes.”

“The US has a relative undersupply of maternity care providers especially midwives and lacks comprehensive postpartum supports” wrote doctoral researcher Roosa Tikkanen in a report for The Commonwealth Fund examining the disparities.

America meanwhile is by some accounts the most expensive country to give birth in and the only developed country without mandated paid parental leave.

But this is not a purely philanthropic work Hanna said. Maternal and infant health care is a $160 billion industry in the United States. Failures in care coordination account for $27.2 billion to $78.2 billion in unnecessary medical fees and waste per year according to a 2019 Journal of the American Medical Association study.

“If we even scratch the surface of solving this problem for any mothers and babies in this country” said Hanna “we have unlocked billions of dollars of potential here.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8wNy9jb21wYW5pZXMtYXJlLXRyYWNraW5nLWhvdy1vZnRlbi1lbXBsb3llZXMtYXJlLWNvbWluZy10by10aGUtb2ZmaWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs are monitoring office attendance through ID card swipes. For some top ...,"You probably don’t think twice when you swipe your ID badge to get into your office in the morning but your employer might be paying attention.

JPMorgan Chase made headlines in April when Business Insider reported that the financial institution is gathering data from ID badge swipes to ascertain how often employees are coming into the office in accordance with its return-to-office policies. That data is then compiled in reports that managers can use to enforce in-person work quotas. JPMorgan declined to respond to Fortune‘s request for comment.

Four JPMorgan bankers anonymously shared details with Business Insider including screenshots of messages between managing and executive directors at the bank describing a dashboard that denotes how many days employees swiped into the office out of the possible number of eligible days.

In his annual letter to shareholders last month JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said about 10% of employees are permitted to work remotely full time about half must return to the office full time and the remaining 40% can split their time. For that last group Dimon said he and the company’s executives maintain a “general expectation” of three days of in-person work per week.

Like Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon who called remote work an “aberration” Dimon has long bemoaned how virtual meetings squash “spontaneous idea generation” and effective leadership and training. In June 2021 JPMorgan issued a companywide hybrid return-to-office memo. “We want each of you back regularly so that we can test the effectiveness of these models as quickly as possible” he said at the time.

While the dashboards might just be an attempt to understand if return-to-office plans are working some JPMorgan employees are angry that they’re being monitored so closely.

Bankers have taken to Blind an anonymous corporate message board to discuss the issue. In February one post complained “We are treated like children who don’t want to do their homework and need constant monitoring.”

But some of JPMorgan’s employees are resigned to accept the bank’s monitoring practice which is arguably not that dissimilar to when an hourly employee punches a timecard at the beginning and end of a shift.

“Nobody wants to be monitored but … It’s the company’s data and we don’t have a choice” one anonymous JPMorgan source told Business Insider. “People want to be trusted to work from home and be treated as adults. But there’s always a free rider.”

Some are less willing to compromise. Blind is littered with posts from bankers seeking out more remote-friendly jobs largely in the tech industry at giants like Meta Salesforce and Airbnb.

Poor planning

Nicholas Bloom economics professor at Stanford and co-founder of WFH Research thinks the mere existence of these employee monitoring programs shows a real lack of foresight.

“Women people with disabilities and people of color all have a preference for remote work—not only are Goldman and JPMorgan upsetting employees they’ll face issues of diversity if they continue on this” Bloom tells Fortune. “That’s just another cost I don’t think they’re aware of.”

Bloom argues that companies like JPMorgan which are monitoring their unhappy workforce haven’t clearly considered their end goal. Say a worker only comes in two days a week instead of the required three. HR discovers this by tracking swipes and tells the worker’s manager.

“Where does the manager go from there?” Bloom asks.

They have two choices Bloom says: They can ignore it which would make it clear to employees that the rule has no teeth and ultimately makes management look weak. Option two: They start to penalize people and say “I know you perform well and hit your targets but your attendance isn’t good so we’re slashing your pay.”

“Obviously that just pushes high performers out the door to your competitors” Bloom says. “Neither of those choices are appealing so either way you execute I don’t see how it’s a good policy.”

Not for nothing he adds Goldman and JPMorgan are elite organizations. “Everyone there is super ambitious; they’re stars of their class not slackers” he says. “They’d generally do anything to improve their career. In-office mandates being unpopular should show that it’s not important.”

Consider the alternatives

Tracking employees’ office attendance has been commonplace for decades even in white collar work Mark Ein chairman of Kastle Systems a property management and security firm tells Fortune. “Aside from attendance people are trying to figure out what the new world of work will look like and they want to see how workers are utilizing the space.”

Some of Ein’s clients deeply believe the office is important for “getting the most out of a company” he says. “But they have to remember: White collar workers were in the office 60 to 70% of the time pre-COVID anyway. They were on business trips or offsite meetings. One hundred percent attendance doesn’t have to be the goal.”

It’s easy for managers to get stuck on where the work happens “but the most successful hybrid companies shift that focus to how to support the work that happens” Zach Dunn co-founder of Robin a hybrid workplace management platform tells Fortune. “If we think of the office as a tool to use we can start focusing on how to make it as useful as possible for the workers that access it.”

Instead of tracking comings and goings and demanding employees explain why they aren’t coming in Dunn suggests reframing the question to “What work would you prefer doing in the office?”

Insisting on in-office work is at best shortsighted and at worst unproductive Dunn adds. “Employees already know this: Focus on output not ID swipes.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vYWlybWFpbC5uZXdzL2lzc3Vlcy8yMDIyLTUtNy90d28tdHVybnRhYmxlcy1hbmQtdGhlLWdvbGRtYW4tc2FjaHMtcmV2b2x00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"At Goldman Sachs Revolt Pits Young Staffers Against C.E.O. David ""D-Sol"" Solomon","There’s a real tug-of-war going on down at 200 West Street the Manhattan world headquarters of Goldman Sachs.

On one side of the rope are the heavyweights—smaller in number but greater in leverage—beginning with C.E.O. David Solomon or “D.J. D-Sol” as the 60-year-old has dubbed himself in his party-centric side-hustle world: D.J.-ing. (In July D-Sol will be spinning at Lollapalooza believe it or not alongside Metallica and Dua Lipa.)

Backing up Solomon (at Goldman not onstage) is his deputy John Waldron the firm’s president and chief operating officer. They are assisted in this battle by other members of Goldman’s management committee such as Dina Powell McCormick a former deputy national-security adviser to Donald Trump; John F. W. Rogers a former White House assistant to Ronald Reagan and the longtime Goldman consigliere; and Alison Mass chairman of Goldman’s investment-banking division.

Spinning: David “D-Sol” Solomon D.J.-ing in Water Mill New York.

On the other side of the rope pulling hard and in greater numbers are the hundreds of junior bankers—known as “analysts” in Wall Street terminology—who are staging a revolt against the firm’s long-standing office culture. Their numbers are bigger for sure but their collective strength is being tested. After all these “analysts” are expendable.

It’s harder to get an entry-level job at Goldman Sachs than it is to crack Harvard. The school accepted 3.19 percent of applicants for its class of 2026. Goldman has it beat by a landslide. According to the bank it received 236000 applications from students seeking internships and reportedly accepted just 1.5 percent of them.

At the moment you can score the fight 5–0 for management—or in some cases 7–0 (as in days of the week). To translate: for the older generation the battle is about how many days a week Goldman’s bankers traders asset managers and technologists must be in the office and how many days they can continue to work from home. Management wants the youngsters in the office five days a week no questions asked; the analysts want to have some WFH days.

It’s harder to get an entry-level job at Goldman Sachs than it is to crack Harvard.

The war being waged at Goldman Sachs is similar to the one being waged across other Wall Street firms as well as at the law consulting and accounting firms that service them and their global clientele. It’s also about how many of the perks that became standard during the pandemic will remain in force now that things with respect to the virus—fingers crossed—seem to be easing up. And beyond perks how many days a week will those recent college grads get to work from home in their joggers and T-shirts and how many days will they have to trudge down to 200 West Street in what passes these days for acceptable Wall Street attire?

This is not a minor skirmish. And Solomon is clear about what he wants. “We want people to generally come together” he told CNBC at the Milken Institute Global Conference earlier this week. “We want people to work in teams we’re a collaborative culture.”

Solomon has previously said that working from home is an “aberration” and recently told Fortune that “the secret sauce to our organization is: we attract thousands of really extraordinary young people who come to Goldman Sachs to learn to work to create a network of other extraordinary people and work very hard to serve our clients…. For Goldman Sachs to retain that cultural foundation we have to bring people together.”

You have been summoned: Goldman Sachs employees returning to HQ in New York last June.

As a former M&A banker at Lazard at Merrill Lynch and at JPMorgan Chase I couldn’t agree with Solomon more. Investment banking trading and investing are apprenticeship businesses where the skills are learned gradually from the Jedi masters. Giving the right advice during a sale or acquisition of a company takes years to perfect and mistakes have serious consequences. You must learn from the best and there is no substitute for the subtleties and the wisdom of deal-doing that comes from watching the experts live and in action.

Yet in a company where that same C.E.O. is jetting off to party and to work the turntables at music festivals that these junior analysts would no doubt rather be at instead of stuck at their desks all weekend—well there is another increasingly vocal reaction to Solomon. Of late Goldman’s pissed-off junior bankers have taken to the aptly named Blind an anonymous-messaging app to complain about the increasing pressure being put on them by Goldman’s top management to get them to return to the office for work. Moreover Goldman is using technology to track whether the junior bankers show up in the office. As one Goldmanite wrote on Blind “The top management says it’s employees’ choice but internally they track which team has most in office attendance.”

Added another “It’s f**ing bulls**t from top management saying they are people first. In our team meeting a manager showed us the excel [spreadsheet software] where the MDs [managing directors] are tracking which department has not met in-office commitments.” And another: “Apparently they are tracking everyone’s attendance and managers are getting lists of people who have low attendance so they can bully them into coming in.”

There is now chatter on Blind of junior bankers doing what was almost unthinkable pre-pandemic: dumping Goldman. All because of the 7–0 debate. “I saw 30% attrition in my team in NY” wrote one Goldman employee in late April “and have seen/heard a lot of people leaving Goldman Sachs in NY/Dallas locations.”

Of late Goldman’s pissed-off junior bankers have taken to the aptly named Blind an anonymous-messaging app to complain.

Someone working at Google where the return-to-work mandate is much more fluid than at Goldman wrote on Blind that if he or she worked at Goldman they would quit. “Totally” replied someone at Goldman. “Even I want to prepare for some interviews.”

On May 1 a Blind poster listed his or her gripes about Goldman including a “shitty work culture” “forced RTO [return to work]” “elimination of vacation carryover policy” and (my favorite): “ass licking = better performance.”

(For Goldman’s part a spokesperson told me they wouldn’t comment on the debate instead referring me to David Solomon’s CNBC interview at the Milken Institute Global Conference earlier this week.)

Something else that’s really fueling the rage: Goldman’s changing—and wildly disproportionate—perks. They’ve always been a part of the culture but starting April 25 Goldman eliminated a variety of coronavirus-era perquisites. Gone are the free car rides to and from work replaced by a single free car ride home from 200 West Street after a certain time of night usually nine p.m. Also gone are the free lunch and the free breakfast. Cash registers have reappeared in the Goldman cafeterias. And there are reports of no more free coffee. (Need we remind you that the total compensation of a junior analyst at Goldman Sachs these days is around $200000?) As a result of complaints about the rising cost of delivery and taxes for takeout food Goldman did agree to raise the dinner stipend to $30 from $25—on the condition that the junior employee work through dinner.

Solomon left and former Goldman Sachs C.E.O. Lloyd Blankfein at headquarters.

But the forced return to the office and the return to a more normal set of perks for the junior-banking crowd at Goldman is not happening in a vacuum. Rather it is happening in the context of Goldman’s coming off 2021—its best year ever where the bank made a profit of $21 billion. (By comparison JPMorgan Chase a Goldman rival made a profit of $48 billion in 2021.) The bonuses at Goldman were also said to be quite robust especially so for both Solomon and Waldron. Solomon’s total compensation for 2021 was $35 million; Waldron made $33 million. (Meanwhile the median bonus for a junior analyst at Goldman in 2021 was reportedly about $100000.)

In addition the Goldman board decided in its infinite wisdom that the two men needed more incentives to stick around. In October Goldman decided to award Solomon a roughly $30 million stock grant and Waldron a $20 million stock grant. Both stock awards do not vest until 2026.

But even that was not enough for the top executives at Goldman Sachs. According to The Wall Street Journal Solomon and a small group of top people are going to start taking for themselves a bigger slice of the bounty that comes from Goldman’s large private-equity business. The logic I guess is that despite the large pay packages for Solomon Waldron et al. they still are not paid as lushly as their private-equity counterparts. For instance Stephen Schwarzman the co-founder of the über-successful Blackstone Group took home some $1.1 billion in compensation in 2021 while his competitors at KKR Henry Kravis and George Roberts took home around $110 million each.

It’s clear that 2022 is shaping up to be a very different year in the financial markets than 2020 or 2021. That will probably mean lower pay at most levels of the Wall Street hierarchy. But there’s still an obscene amount of money sloshing around the Wall Street canyons making the decision to cut out the free lunch for the youngsters even more difficult to fathom especially when an important goal is to get them to return to work at the office.

By Yoruk Bahceli

(Reuters) - Already sitting on double-digit losses this year stock market investors must brace for more as the realisation sinks in that the U.S. Federal Reserve intends to tighten financial conditions to get on top of red-hot inflation.

Essentially financial conditions measure how easily households and businesses can access credit so are critical in showing how monetary policy transmits to the economy. Fed boss Jerome Powell repeated on Wednesday he will be keeping a close eye on them.

And they have a bearing on future growth - Goldman Sachs estimates a 100 basis-point tightening in its proprietary financial conditions index (FCI) - which factors in rates credit and equity levels as well as the dollar - crimps growth by one percentage point over the following year.

Goldman's and other indexes from the Chicago Fed and IMF all show financial conditions have tightened significantly this year but remain loose historically a testament to the scale of stimulus unleashed to help economies weather the pandemic.

Sven Jari Stehn chief European economist at Goldman Sachs estimates the bank's U.S. financial conditions index will need to tighten somewhat further for the Fed to achieve a ""soft landing"" i.e. to slow growth but not excessively.

Goldman's U.S. FCI is at 99 points - 200 bps tighter than at the start of the year and the tightest since July 2020. Conditions tightened 0.3 points on Thursday as shares tanked the dollar hit two-decade highs and 10-year bond yields closed above 3%.

But they still remain historically loose.

""Our estimate is that the Fed basically needs to halve (the jobs-workers gap) to try to get wage growth back to a more normal growth rate"" Stehn said.

""To do that they essentially need to reduce growth to a rate of around 1% for a year or two so you have to go below trend for a year or two.""

He expects 50 bps hikes in June and July then 25 bps moves until policy rates rise just above 3%. But if conditions do not tighten enough and wage growth and inflation do not moderate sufficiently the Fed may continue with 50 bps hikes he said.

FCI looseness appears puzzling given market bets that the Fed will lift rates above 3% by year-end while running down its bond holdings sharply higher Treasury yields and tumbling stocks.

But the S&P 500 still trades 20% above its pre-pandemic peak. Through the wealth effect equity prices are thought to support household spending.

That may change - the Fed stopped growing its balance sheet in March and will start cutting it from June eventually at a monthly $95 billion rate embarking on quantitative tightening (QT)

Michael Howell managing director at consultancy Crossborder Capital noted that U.S. equity declines have tracked a 14% drop in effective liquidity provision by the Fed since December.

He estimates based on pandemic-time stock rallies and recent falls each monthly reduction could knock 60 points off the S&P 500.

The stock market ""is certainly not discounting any further reduction in liquidity and we know that's going to happen"" Howell said.

UNFAMILIAR TERRITORY

The question is whether the Fed can tighten conditions just enough to cool prices but not so much that growth and markets are seriously hit.

A risk - highlighted by Bank of England policymaker Catherine Mann - is that central banks' huge balance sheets may have muted transmission of monetary policy into financial conditions.

If so the Fed may need to act more aggressively than expected.

Mike Kelly head of global multi-asset at PineBridge Investments noted that past QT episodes had been far smaller so ""we are going into an environment that no one's ever seen before.""

During the QT exercises of 2013 and 2018 stocks tanked 10% forcing the Fed to ease back on tightening.

But those used to relying on the Fed ""put"" - the belief it will step in and backstop stock markets - should watch out; Citi analysts reckon this put may not kick in before the S&P 500 endures another 20% fall.

""Where you have 8.5% inflation... the strike price of the central bank put option is a lot lower than it used to be"" said Patrick Saner head of macro strategy at insurer Swiss Re.

Of particular concern is $52.6 million in option awards granted to Dimon “nearly double the size of his regular equity grant for 2021” and representing much of his $84.4 million in annual pay Glass Lewis said in a report. The firm also criticized the $53.3 million in total compensation for Daniel Pinto the president and chief operating officer which included almost $27.9 million in option awards.

“Excessive one-off grants to the CEO and COO amid tepid relative performance worsen long-standing concerns regarding the company’s executive-pay program” Glass Lewis said in its report. “Shareholders should consider the company’s sustained disconnect between executive pay and performance over the last nine years.”

The advisory resolution up for a vote by shareholders at the New York-based bank’s annual meeting on May 17 is nonbinding. Glass Lewis and other firms that analyze company disclosures to advise investors how to vote at yearly meetings have come out against a slew of recent high-profile awards. Companies have said the awards are necessary to retain leadership in a heated market for talent.

The options grant given to Dimon is intended to show the board wants him “to continue leading the firm for a significant number of future years” JPMorgan said in response to Glass Lewis’s recommendation. In the case of pay for the company’s president “the board is acting responsibly in shareholders’ best interests in case Mr. Pinto needs to once again serve as CEO as a result of unforeseen circumstances.”

In 2020 the 59-year-old Pinto served as acting co-CEO while Dimon was sidelined by emergency heart surgery just as the coronavirus pandemic roiled markets. Since then Pinto has moved to New York from London to assume the roles of sole president and COO titles he shared with Gordon Smith before Smith’s retirement.

JPMorgan valued the options that make up Dimon’s and Pinto’s special bonuses for accounting purposes but the amount they will ultimately be paid is subject to change based on JPMorgan’s stock price.

The grant to Dimon “incentivizes a successful leadership transition by requiring the CEO’s leadership for at least five years before the awards vest and another five years until he may sell any vested shares” which “ensures direct alignment with shareholder returns over the next decade” JPMorgan said in its response. (The 66-year-old Dimon whenever asked how long he will remain CEO has long joked that he’ll stay for five more years.)

Rival Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs Group Inc. awarded special bonus grants in October to CEO David Solomon and President John Waldron that put them in line for about $50 million in one-time bonuses saying they were intended to guarantee leadership continuity and talent retention. Glass Lewis recommended shareholders vote against their pay package as well.

Institutional Shareholder Services another large proxy-advisory firm also has recommended voting against the pay packages for Dimon and other JPMorgan executives. Compensation for top finance executives including those at JPMorgan and Goldman has lost much of its value with recent market declines. JPMorgan’s share price is down almost 30% since its October high and is below its pre-pandemic levels.

SOUTH SOUTH REGIONAL MANAGER SHOLA NATH O’NEIL lays bare the paradox of the once flourishing city of Warri invoking its glory days and juxtaposing it with its current decays. He tells the story of how successive governments policies (or lack of it) the costly protracted ethnic bloodletting and destruction has humbled a city that at its peak was touted the Dubai of Southern Nigeria.

Warri invokes worries tears for residents visitors

How Ibori Uduaghan and Okowa ‘killed’ the city

Warri arguably the economic nerve centre of Delta State always fazes first time visitors. Dubbed the Oil City it is the economic hub of the state and a once flourishing nexus of oil and gas commerce in Nigeria. In its yore days it was rivaled in prominence in the south-south only by Port Harcourt. It was an investors’ haven. But even in its glory days the city promised so much for first-time visitors but delivers agonizingly very little. The refrain is usually: “is this all there is to Warri?”

If Warri was a failure in the past its current wretched state is depressing for Old Warri (men and women born and/brought up in the city). This bustling town that hosted oil multinationals such as Shell Petroleum Development Company SPDC Chevron Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries and other ancillaries and servicing companies now lays supine.

Reflecting on the underdevelopment of the city MC Mecoyo a skit maker and comedian from southeastern Nigeria commented this on his recent visit to the city: “I saw Warri and I was worried!.” He recalled that in the past when people trooped to Warri because of its fame and companies concluding “As I am talking to you now Warri is worrisome”. Mecoyo is a comedian but the current state of Warri is not a joke.

For Mike Tom a middle-aged man who was born in Warri and has live there for most part of his life “the fall of Warri is painful; Warri is finished and in shambles.” He described Warri as a city that has been crippled and in its final lapse of collapse”.

With pain in his voice Tom who fits the bill of the famed ‘Old Warri’ recalled growing up in the 1970s to 80s with Snaprogetti Santafe the Schlumbergers West Minster Dredging AGIP SSNL and GloryLux which provided jobs for women to support their families concluding that Warri’s fate agonises his inhabitants.

Those who knew the city well could not disagree with Tom. Apart from the above Schlumberger companies (Dowell Anadrill) Halliburton Pan Ocean Oceaneering Edikan Nestoil LAMNALCO WEAFRI ELF and others even small businesses thrived and the common man enjoyed chunky crumps of this success. Although there wasn’t much in infrastructure to go with its fame Mcdermott (later Globestar) Nigeria Dredging and Marine and Seismograph Service Limited (SSL) and several others ensured that those who had little to no formal education were gainfully employed.

SCOA Mandillas John Holt and several other motor and leisure companies jostled for space contracts and bite of the apple. The Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA) hosted dozens of maritime and shipping firms; ships berthed with cargoes and provided menial and daily job opportunities for locals. Merchant mariners and stevedoring thrived; everybody had something and even market women benefited from the thriving middleclass in the city. Warri was peaceful and enjoyable.

Then the Warri Crisis erupted in 1997 and everything changed. Militias fighting site of a local government headquarters went on a five year rampage that unhinged the city. Dichotomies surfaced tribal distinctions were highlighted and underlined as Ijaws and Itsekiri ethnic nationalities on one hand the Itsekiris and Urhobos (mostly of Okere descendants) on the other as well as the Ijaw/Urhobo of Ogbe-Ijaw/Aladja battled for supremacy and land ownership. The wars exerted huge tolls and peace was its first victim and it remains elusive. In Aladja and Ogbe-Ijoh-Warri Urhobo and Ijaw communities in Udu and Warri South respectively several commissions of enquiries white papers and peace accords have failed to sate the thirsts for blood.

The city paid heavily – and is still paying – for those crises; many lost their lives others lost loved ones and breadwinners; children were orphaned and parents including a pastor at the Foursquare Gospel Church Koko Warri North who lost four children (thrown into the raging fire that used to be their home) and others have emblems of destructions etched in their hearts.

Any government aiming to teach its citizen the effects of war and inter-tribal crises needs look no further than the once pulsating business hub of Warri – a bustling city that went from the acme of its success to its abject nadir in a couple of years. The fall was as steep as its effect was caustic.

As this reporter drove through the city in April 2022 one could feel the ebbing pulse of this dying city. It still wears the garbs of its lost glory shamelessly; its precipitous fame and lost opportunities are unabashed. The roads are deplorable and everything about it is bleak. The current administration failed even a new road in seven years and the ones built by past government are in ruins. The unending flood control drain achieves little apart from making commute painful and slow. From Airport road to Okere-Ugborikoko Okere Jakpa Refinery and dozens others like the city lay in ruins. The few shining spots are results beautification projects by a Christian organization in the city.

The crests of fratricidal tribal wars survives in burnt buildings hearts and psyches of men and women who remember what the city used to be like when there were no ethnic fault lines; when the Ijaws Itsekiris and Urhobos intermarried and lived as a unit and were happy to be called Waffarians. Now suspicions becloud the land where ethnic groups’ social intercourse intermarriages shared history values and tradition once blurred differences.

“There was a time when people are not identified as Ijaw Itsekiri or Urhobo they were merely Warri and Waffarians but today the war has taken away our unity and development” Lucky Isah rued.

He recalled that in those good old days Ijaw Itsekiri and Urhobos celebrated boat regattas on the Warri River; the yearly Agbassa Okere and 30-yearly Awankere festivals which drew tourists from within and outside the state. “In the 90s to late 1990s oil-stained coveralls helmets and life vests were indications of successful youths. Some earned up to $4000 monthly as unskilled or semi-skilled workers fitters welders and dockworkers.

WARRI NOW NUCLEUS OF RITUAL KILLERS YAHOO BOYS

The city has turned on its head. The signs of successful youths in the city are Mercedes Benz GLKs Lexus RXs and Toyota Camry (Spider) that are driven by school dropouts and teenagers who brandish university ID cards but can barely read the inscriptions therein. They are aged from 20 – 30 and didn’t make their money as welders or roughnecks working in offshore rigs as their counterparts of decades past; these are heartless and ruthless youths who kill engage in obnoxious money-rituals and trade in human parts. They are slayers of their parents and siblings for money-minting rituals and those who engage in armed robberies kidnapping and other dirty deals that bring money – no matter how bestial.

Famously called ‘Yahoo Boys’ they’ve replaced the oil and servicing firms. Instead of vibrant young men and women who inspired others to learn skills such as welding and fitting scaffolding and other high-demand oil and gas-related skills these are criminals. They inspire younger ones of similar ilk who dream of success without work; those than want to hammer (make money) without labour.

Ladies are not left out. The ambition of those who can’t engage in these crimes is to marry one. Young girls whose life ambition is to own boutiques where hair extensions and wigs (human hair) clothes with fake designers’ labels are sold at outlandish prices; eateries where badly cooked meals are given exotic tags and sold at prices that only crooks can afford.

“You see and hear of how girls are murdered their genitals and vital organs cut off yet our ladies are not bothered. Some are even engaging in these acts while others want to be married to yahoo boys.”

The economy of Warri like other cities in Delta is driven by crimes and frauds. All moral compasses are pointed south: Parents who ought to teach their children morals regale in their ill-gotten wealth – they even help to conceal the sources by claiming ownership of multimillion naira cars and houses bought with proceeds of these crimes. Pastors don’t preach hard work as prerequisite for success or righteousness as the path to paradise; they aid crimes collect offerings tithes and offer their temples and altars for thanksgiving.

In the Oil City businesses are oiled by activities of ‘Yahoo boys’. Only they politicians pastors and people with questionable sources buy properties. Landlords who once wouldn’t let properties to yahoo boys have made volte-face

“They come posing as businessmen or techies owners of shops in Robson Plaza (the city’s answer to Computer Village in Lagos) or importers” one landlord whose apartments are fully occupied by Yahoo Boys in Effurun said. “We (landlords) pretend to believe them and hope that they do not use our children and family for money rituals because of the condition of the city.”

In between those are the graduates and master’s degree holders who are determined to stay on the straight paths. For those the escape route is commercial tricycle (keke) operation. The menace of the contraption and its operators has made the city one of the worst to drive around in Nigeria. Tom said Warri is the world headquarters of tricycle even calling for it to be banned. The stress of surviving in the crowded business ages operators faster than their ages.

HOW PDP GOVERNMENTS FAILED WARRI FOR 20 YEARS

The tale of Warri fall from grace is incomplete without record of the role played by successive governments that failed to develop the city since 1999. Firmly under the grip of the ruling Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) three successive governments have failed to initiate or follow through on projects and policies that were meant to maintain the status of the city as the economic capital of Delta as well as help the state wean its dependency on crude oil.

JAMES ONANEFE IBORI: remains the godfather of the state’s politics despite his sojourn and incarceration in the United Kingdom for money laundering. Many believe that Warri and other parts of the state would continue the slide until his influence as ‘selector’ of leaders is curbed. “He created the culture of picking unqualified among the various ethnic groups and empowering them to lead. The focus is not on development but on people who could ‘deliver’ (help win elections)” an Itsekiri leader (names withheld) once told this reporter.

In fairness to him Ibori developed his home Oghara kingdom (at the detriment of the state) ensuring that most projects were sited there. Roads were constructed and federal and state projects taken to Oghara and neighboring abodes. ECONET’s (later Airtel) telecom training school Nigeria Navy School of Logistics and (moribund) Independent Power Plant found Oghara as most suitable location. When he established up three polytechnics two were sited Otefe Oghara and Mosogar (within 20 mile) in his Ethiope West LGA. Delta State University Teaching Hospital (DELSUTH) was sighted in Oghara which is more than 31km from the school even though a full-fledge Baptist Medical Hospital was at DELSU’s doorstep in nearby Eku.

Despite his shortcomings Ibori is still revered road dualisation projects in Warri and environs. Sadly those projects were used for ’empowerment’ of godfathers cronies and friends. Attention was not paid to quality resulting in projects failing even before contracts left sites. Airport Road has been resurfaced/revamped about five times since 2007. Today it currently lays in ruin. The World Bank assisted multibillion naira Warri Water Project has defied solutions for 20 odd years making Warri a thirsty city that sits atop water. Landlords and homeowners are their own ‘water boards’ electricity and security providers.

EMMANUEL EWETAN UDUAGHAN (2007 -2015): He succeeded Ibori his cousin and childhood friend in 2007. He is a Warri boy whose emergence raised hope that the Oil City would finally be developed. Sadly during his tenure oil multinationals fled the city in droves. From downsizing in the mid-2000s through SoFu (Securing our Future) initiatives SHELL shut down its operation in Warri and moved to deep sea (circa 2013) and in 2014 crude prices crashed throwing the state into abyss. Critics blame Uduaghan for not doing enough to stop the relocation of SHELL but the yeast that destroyed Warri started fermenting years earlier..

Shell relocation was just the final nail in the coffin; oil companies were fleeing Warri in the wake of the crisis and unfriendly operating environment. The Warri Crisis sowed the wind that yielded the whirlwind that finally blew companies out of the state and taking with them jobs opportunities and multibillion naira monthly tax revenues. The destruction of oil facilities and cut of oil supply also hit the state’s finances.

Uduaghan tried to stimulate economic activities in the city with lobbies to resuscitate the comatose Warri Ports and Delta Steel Company (DSC). There were economic projects and initiatives such as Warri Economic Business Centre the Oleri Entertainment Village and expansion and upgrade of the Warri Airport (Osubi) in tandem with his administration’s Delta Without Oil vision. There were others like the Warri-Trans-Ode-Itsekiri (Big Warri) road project Omadin Okerenkoko – Oporoza and others to link the mainland (Warri metropolis) to the other Warri LGA’s of the state.

However Uduaghan’s administration would be remembered by stakeholders as a lost opportunity to turn Warri’s fortune around. He brimmed with ideas for the city but lacked the zeal of execution. His Itsekiri kinsmen would rue his failure to complete the Warri-Ode-Itsekiri road project. The road would have linked and opened up the Ode-Itsekiri through a bridge over the Warri River to Ubeji and other historical Itsekiri villages into the metropolis.

“Uduaghan was in the best position to build the Ode-Itsekiri Bridge and ensure that we can drive our cars into our ancestral home yet he choose to be a statesman and frittered the chance” an Ubeji community leader said.

There is also his failure to turn the tide on horrendous underdevelopment and squalor in oil-rich Ugborodo community in Warri Southwest LGA. The area accounts for a huge mass of the state’s oil production and hosts the first offshore oil field in Nigeria (Okan Field) yet stench of its poverty is pervasive. Few powerful youths and leaders amass and fiddle with its resources. A multibillion naira new town project is stalled for over 20 years while inhabitants live in squalor of makeshift huts and shanties.

Millions of naira paid by Chevron Nigeria Limited for the relocation of inhabitants of the current site of the $9billion Escravos Gas to Liquid (EGTL) went into the pockets of few powerful individuals and politicians. Even sharp sand that was dredged for construction of houses was sold.

IFEANYI ARTHUR OKOWA: If Uduaghan lacked political will to develop Warri the same cannot be said of the current governor Dr Ifeanyi Okowa. If anything the Agbor-born politician has used power brazenly in execution of projects in his hometown of Owa in Ika Northeast LGA even at the detriment of Warri and other parts of the state. He accused by some of deliberately undermining the status of Warri areas as the goose the lays the state’s golden eggs.

“The governor’s body language is as if his hometown can only develop when Warri is destroyed” a former member of his cabinet told our reporter. The source who asked not to be named revealed that the governor has throughout his administration starved the Warri-Uvwie and Environs Development Commission of fund while massively funding the Asaba Capital Territory Development Commission and projects in Ika. The source further added that the closure of the Governor’s Office Annex in Warri was part of the governor’s agenda to ensure that the city does not rival the state capital in prominence. The office annex was used as a venue for peace meetings and to address security challenges in the city and other parts of oil bearing south by the governor’s two predecessors.

“Okowa and some stakeholders in the north do not like the idea that there is a Government House Annex in Warri. They think it is a conspiracy to create another capital city to rival Asaba. So when Okowa (from the Delta North) came he saw his position as an opportunity to downgrade Warri without realizing the role that the office played in peace and security in the riverside areas” a Warri member of the PDP said on condition of anonymity because of his political future.

Elder statesman and former labour leader Chief Frank Kokori slammed Governor Okowa as an “ethnic champion” with “self-centered policies”. Speaking with The Nation’s Elo Edremoda Kokori elaborated: “Before Warri had everything. Now the whole roads are bad (no (good road) network nothing. The man is trying to turn his own place to a small London like we accused Ibori of.”

Our checks revealed that it is not only leaders like Kokori that are unhappy with Okowa’s distribution of projects. Our finding shows that there are other disgruntled segments in the Delta North Senatorial District (made up of eight LGAs) who accuse him of siting all new projects in his Owa (Oyibo and Aliero) hometown in Ika Northeast. A source confided in our reporter that the governor has also drawn the ire of a first class traditional ruler in the north over such antics.

“Okowa has established three new universities and sited a medical school in Agbor (Ika Northwest) whiles the Delta State University Teaching Hospital in Oghara is dying from lack of fund. There is already a campus of DELSU in Anwai yet he felt the state needs three new universities all because he wanted one in his homestead.”

“There is the Oleri Tourist village in Udu (near Warri) initiated by Uduaghan but instead of continuing with the project he started a new tourist/film village in Ika land with expedient financing and speedy development” another source added.

“This clannish mindset is also exhibited with the state’s airports. He is consciously neglecting the Warri (Osubi) Airport but heavily financing the Asaba Airport initiated and inaugurated by his immediate predecessor in the north. If Uduaghan had been so clannish would there be an Airport in Asaba?

“Okowa also took the Advanced Diagnostic Medical Centre and the Mother and Child Hospital to Owa Alero; Federal Road Safety Commission Training School Owa-Oyibu Teachers Professional and Development Centre Owa-Oyibu all centred just within short distance from his home town in Ika Northeast” the source stated.

For Kokori the location of the medical centres in the governor’s hometown is to kill DELSUTH in Oghara. “Okowa is becoming something else. It’s an egocentric sort of attitude. He won’t be the governor forever so he should think about that. That is why his legacy will just go back to the dustbin when he leaves that place. We are not saying Ika people should not have something but not by neglecting sections of the state like the whole Ukwani Ndokwa people.”

“Every governor of Delta state should treat the three senatorial districts equally and distribute all these infrastructures equally among them. It is unfair to the people. I am not in PDP but I am not happy with what he is doing. He should think of the future and being patriotic to the people. Delta state needs a leader that carries the whole people because Delta is a multilingual multiethnic state. He should put that in his mind in all the policies he makes” Kokori added.

The Chief Press Secretary to Governor Okowa Mr Olisa Ifeajika was unperturbed by the allegations against his boss. Rather than react to the issues raised by the governor’s critics the CPS engaged in a game of hide-and-seek with our reporter Okungbowa Aiwerie who was detailed to get the governor’s reaction. For over one month Ifeajika kept promising to react without doing so. He made and broke similar promise twice without responding at press time on Saturday.",,,

Here's what they are.,"The city of Hartford’s push to pay for municipal services and its schools and at the same time whittle away at a tax rate that is the highest in the state comes up against a sobering reality: 1500 properties that don’t have to pay real estate taxes.

A 2021 statewide report from the state Office of Policy and Management showed that if taxed Hartford’s tax-exempt property would account for 51% of the city’s grand list in 2019 bested only by New Haven with 56% and Mansfield at 58%. According to the report most towns and cities in Connecticut were 30% or less with the statewide average coming in at 14.2%.

A review by The Courant of real estate tax data provided by the city as of Oct. 1 showed that tax-exempt real estate would have generated $370.3 million in property taxes for the city ranging from state-owned buildings and private colleges to hospitals and historical sites. The Courant’s review focused on real estate and does not include business equipment other personal property and eligible motor vehicles.

“For a city like Hartford it’s all the more exacerbated by the fact that the city’s tax base is limited to begin with” said Matt Hart executive director the Capital Region Council of Governments and former town manager of West Hartford. “It’s a small geographic area and Hartford’s grand list is roughly half the size of West Hartford’s but the population is twice as large as West Hartford’s.”

“So that serves to show the challenge the city is facing” Hart said.

The exempted properties bring many other benefits to the city: culture and arts that attract visitors; colleges and universities that introduce students — and potential future workers — to the city; and centers of medical care that are using cutting-edge technology.

In a state where towns and cities depend heavily on property taxes to pay for municipal services and schools the loss of tax revenue still remains a critical issue for Hartford.

“One of the challenges for Hartford is that we are a geographically small city with very few undeveloped parcels of land that aren’t brownfields” Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin said. “That means the opportunities for growth are limited by our size.”

Hartford encompasses about 18 square miles.

“If you take a geographically small city and then take half of the property off the tax rolls it leaves a much smaller taxable base” Bronin said.

The state does reimburse Hartford — as it does other cities and towns — a portion of the lost tax revenue for state-owned buildings private colleges and schools and hospitals through an annual “payment in lieu of taxes” known by its acronym “PILOT.”

According to the city’s tax data the largest block of tax-exempt property is owned by the city. But state-owned property — as Hartford is Connecticut’s capital city — comes in a clear second.

The PILOT program has existed for decades. Traditionally state law called for a 45% reimbursement of property taxes for state-owned buildings and 77% for private colleges and schools. But the actual funding also was subject to the financial ups and downs of the state budget.

According to the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities PILOT reimbursements were actually 14% for state properties in 2021 and 22% for private schools and hospitals.

“They have been nowhere close to where they should be” George Rafael director of CCM’s Municipal Resource and Service Center said. “They made some changes last year that boosted some of the reimbursements but not to the level required by statute.”

State lawmakers approved changes that include creating a three-tiered system that now provides for a new PILOT reimbursement for the poorest cities which includes Hartford. The program now provides Hartford and other “tier-one” cities 50% of what would have been due under a combination of the existing percentage reimbursements for state-owned buildings and private schools and hospitals.

Under the change Hartford saw its PILOT payment rise to $52 million in fiscal year 2022 up from $32 million the previous year according to CCM.

Bronin said the change certainly has helped but with a far lower reimbursement for state-owned real estate the city is still behind.

“Hartford is home to such a large concentration of state buildings that the less favorable funding formula makes a big difference” Bronin said.

West Hartford’s Hall High School held its Junior Prom on Saturday night May 7 2022 returning to a traditional prom experience for students for the first time since 2019.

All proms were canceled in 2020 in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2021 prom was greatly modified with limited attendance.

Saturday’s weather was chilly and windy but that didn’t stop prom-goers and their families from posing for outdoor photo sessions at scenic locations throughout West Hartford before the official gala began.

There are many photos posted on Facebook but you can share them on We-Ha.com too. Please email any photos you would like added to this gallery to Ronni Newton at [email protected].

Stephanie Thomas got the endorsement for secretary of the state after several frantic hours of lobbying and vote-swapping at the Democratic convention in Hartford on Saturday.

The competitions for state treasurer and secretary of the state were on center stage as a crowded field of candidates vied for the party’s stamp of approval heading into the Democratic primaries this summer. And considerations of race and gender on the ticket played a key role in the selection of Thomas and Russell who are Black.

In the treasurer’s race Russell a bond attorney and former vice chair of the state party from New Haven outflanked both Dita Bhargava a former Wall Street trader from Greenwich and Karen DuBois-Walton chief executive of the New Haven Housing Authority. He won more than 47% of the delegates on the first ballot prompting Bhargava and DuBois-Walton to forgo a second round of voting.

The party also tossed its support behind Thomas a Norwalk resident and state representative for secretary of the state. She defeated an accomplished list of candidates including Sen. Matt Lesser of Middletown Rep. Hilda Santiago of Meriden Rep. Joshua Elliott of Hamden and New Haven’s Health Director Maritza Bond.

But with so many people in the running it took three rounds of voting from the delegates before Thomas could secure her majority and the endorsement.

Locking up the party endorsement won’t guarantee Russell and Thomas the Democratic nomination later this year.

But it could give them a distinct advantage in the months ahead as they enter the primary season. It will also ensure that their names are at the top of the ballot when Connecticut Democrats enter the voting booths in August.

The offices of treasurer and secretary of the state are vitally important for Connecticut residents and the aspirations of the Democratic party which is trying to maintain its hold on every statewide elected office.

The state treasurer is responsible for managing Connecticut’s investments and the pension funds for state employees. And the secretary of the state is integral to the Democratic party’s plans to expand absentee and mail-in voting throughout the state.

The candidates for both offices took their turns on stage at the Xfinity Theater in Hartford highlighting their job histories and making the case for why they would be the best person to run Connecticut’s trust funds or the state’s elections.

“I know how to invest” said Bhargava who also ran for treasurer in 2018. “I’ve posted returns. I’ve managed large portfolios. This is what I know.”

Diversity considerations

But many Democratic officials in attendance were also weighing another set of qualifications: namely the candidates’ genders races ethnicities and abilities to attract voters to the polls.

Several delegates recognized that the contests were being influenced by considerations about the party’s diversity. Many wanted to show that the party’s preferred candidates reflected the state’s diverse electorate including Connecticut’s Black and Hispanic populations.

In the treasurer’s race Russell and Dubois-Walton are Black and Bhargava is Indian American. In the race for secretary of the state Thomas was the only Black candidate. Santiago and Bond are Hispanic and Lesser and Elliott are white.

Gov. Ned Lamont Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz and Attorney General William Tong are all seeking reelection this year and are running unopposed in the primary. Meanwhile Rep. Sean Scanlon had no competition for the endorsement for state comptroller.

That meant that the contests for treasurer and secretary of the state were the only real opportunities for delegates to build more diversity among the party’s picks for statewide offices.

That diversity will be key many Democrats believe as the party seeks to turn out voters this year especially in cities like Hartford New Haven and Bridgeport.

Thomas J. Clarke II a party delegate and Hartford City Councilman said building a diverse coalition of candidates is an important part of growing the party and convincing younger people to turn out to vote.

“The ticket really needs to be reflective of the community” he said.

In his opening speech on the floor Russell hinted at the need for the party to broaden its appeal among voters of color.

“You have a tough decision in front of you” Russell told the crowd. “It’s an important decision to determine how this state looks. … How you vote right now will make the difference in turning out the vote in November.”

The endorsements weren’t the only prize that brought the candidates to the convention on Saturday however. They were also looking to lock in a spot on the primary ballot later this year.

Many of the candidates were successful in garnering enough support to qualify for the primary in August when voters will have the final say in who represents the party in the general election.

All three Democratic candidates for state treasurer and four of the five candidates for secretary of the state earned a spot on the primary ballot through that process.

Rep. Joshua Elliott who was also running to maintain his seat in the state legislature was the only candidate to come up short in his attempts to net at least 15% of the votes on a single ballot.

While bowing out Elliott made the appeal to his fellow Democrats to unite behind whichever candidates win in August and to head into the general election with a united front.

“We’re stronger together. Let’s come together” Elliott said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oYXJ0Zm9yZGNvdXJhbnQvbmFtZS9oZWxsYS1waWNrLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM0NjgzNTYw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hella Pick Obituary (2022) - West Hartford CT - Hartford Courant,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/hartfordcourant/name/hella-pick-obituary?id=34683560 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oYXJ0Zm9yZGNvdXJhbnQvbmFtZS9oZWxsYS1waWNrLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM0NjgzNTYw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

I can honestly say that The Ark is the best thing in that country.

It's 2 storeys of pure TF indulgence. The downstairs bit is all displays of 9 foot tall Optimus prime coming through a gate for photos figures and toys with a small eating area and a little party area with amazing freaking metallic balloons. You can order and eat there but I don't know why you would when you can go upstairs. The shop has a small range of figures you can get in store but quite a good selection of big figs like the Ark figure Robosen Prime and Grimlock (they do not sell those but you can buy either at the space museum oddly enough). They also have hats cardboard masks and other kiddie stuff.

But then you go upstairs and you find the walls are all screens. Bee and Wheeljack come along and chat Megs breaks through the ship windscreen and attacks Unciron flying overhead etc. Generally the place is cool as!!

Food is all Autobrand shaped which I loved to bits. The Happy Meal as it were comes is a big box shaped like the Ark (kinda) and the back opens and you pull out the food.

The only issue I had is that all the drinks are boba or bubble tea and they are each and every one of them was disgusting in both texture and taste you can't get a Coke or a Pepsi branded drink in the place but you can get Evian water and it is served chilled and you can get a cup with ice which in Hong Kong is virtually unheard of.

The prices by HKD standards are very very cheap the quality of the food is good the place is easy to find (Central MTR Times Square exit is directly opposite) and the staff are friendly if not as knowledgeable about the Transformerverse as they ought to be. They have a special offer on at present if you go there and buy food you get a discount on Transformers Branded Sketchers shoes (I'm wearing the Optimus Prime ones as we speak) and it's a good deal. Brand Name shoes are cheaper by far in HKD than in Australia. When I bought my shoes I also got a free thermal drink bottle with Autobot branding.

You can also buy one of 2 ""hampers"". One comes with a baseball Cap with The Ark logo a drink bottle and a keep-warm mug. The other comes with a reversible bucket hat with Ark decals a BIG Autobot symbol cushion and an Ark international travel adaptor (which saved my electronic ass in HK tbh).

I'm biased of course because I have been a TransFan since 1985 this put me in a vastly different age group and demo than I think they were expecting frankly. I was older that everyone except the boss and he didn't seem to know a thing about the toys or the show (though he was atypically nice friendly and helpful for someone who lives in HK). I could not therefore geek out with even the guys in the shop about how amazing the place was. My 17 and 14 year olds were likewise impressed by the place.

I can't recommend a visit to HK but if you do go go to the Ark. You will not regret it.

This season viewers will witness major milestones featuring the introduction of Starlight Glimmer's parents and Princess Celestia's big acting debut. Additionally the Mane 6's Twilight Sparkle Rarity Applejack Pinkie Pie Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy are accompanied by six new creatures including Ocellus the Changeling Silverstream the Hippogriff/Seapony Smolder the Dragon Gallus the Griffin Yona the Yak and Sandbar the Pony joining them on epic adventures throughout new and familiar lands such as Mount Aris Everfree Forest Las Pegasus and more. Fan-favorite characters Maud Pie Spike the Cutie Mark Crusaders Queen Chrysalis and Discord return with exciting storylines and a whole lot of magic!

Together they teach one another valuable lessons about the most powerful magic of all – the magic of friendship.

The company is already starting to plan for HasCon 2019 where Hasbro will have even more exciting things planned for My Little Pony! The convention is set for September 6-8 2019 in Providence RI.

More details and pre-orders on Hasbro Pulse should be coming soon. SG Blaster is a follow up to the previously revealed SG Ultra Magnus. Leaks have said that we should also expect SG Wheeljack and SG Soundwave in the future. Hasbro Pulse is teasing a fifth figure that has yet to be leaked.

Credit(s): In Demand Toys on Facebook Thanks to In Demand Toys on Facebook for posting our first official look at Shattered Glass Blaster. What will likely be an upcoming Transformers Tuesday release we're treated to a slightly more colorful take on SG Blaster with more purple than previous depictions. Sadly he doesn't have the smirking alternate head sculpt that has turned up recently on on at least one G1 Blaster release something that we've seen happen before with Earthrise Starscream (intended for Skywarp) and Kingdom Beast Megatron (intended for but not used by T-Wrecks). It could be that that head sculpt was never meant to be used on the SG Blaster figure but it certainly would have suited him. Sadly he also lacks bicep tribal tattoos. He comes with SG Rewind who retains the exact same color layout as the original SG figure just with clear red.More details and pre-orders on Hasbro Pulse should be coming soon.

Still whenever Blaster comes out for any given toyline I always wonder whether that would be the one to give us our first ""Soundwarrior"" version (I mean the blue/gray/teal one from the original MicroChange line toy also included as an accessory for MP Loudpedal).

There was a toy/comic-ish head back in Titans Return and presumably Twincast will be cartoon- rather than toy-accurate. With three redecoes of the same mold using thia head I'm not optimistic for seeing the comics head this time around.

The fact the white is painted on period (only 2 plastic colors for a figure his size) has me a bit worried about how tight that ball joint is now.

Assuming joint compatibility and clearance aren't an issue how does DK-2's body look with the Drone's head?



Considering that DK-2 is pretty spot-on with IDW Shattered Glass Ironhide except for the face I was curious if you could come REALLY close using these 2 Ironhide recolors. Except for the eye and insignia colors of course.

It's been on my mind but if those rumors of the 5th SG figure of this wave hold true and we're getting a Shattered Glass Metroplex (With the seeming intent that it can be repurposed as a modern G1 Metrotitan) based on the Legacy Metroplex mold I hope that besides the obvious new head that we've seen in the IDW comics they replace the Auto-Axe weapon with something else and do some Alt-Mode finagling like they did with Megatron so it's a City Mode and not a Giant Excavator.

I feel like any SG Metroplex in Metrotitan colors that isn't redecoed from the Thrilling 30 figure would be a massive trolling move by Hasbro. Posted by Sabrblade on May 16th 2022 @ 10:38pm CDT

Agreed. We've been asking for a Metrotitan from T30 Metroplex since it was first revealed some 10 years ago it would be quite the swerve to make it out of Legacy Metroplex. Especially weird when what fans are actually asking for is Deluxe Prowl.



If it happens it will have to be amazing to convince people to drop $200 on it.

In all honesty if we ever were to get a Metrotitan redeco of a Metroplex toy I'd want it to be from a new G1 Metroplex toy that's much better than the old Thrilling 30 one. Shorter stronger sturdier and not so skinny. G1 Metroplex was bulky and wide not lean and limber. Even the FOC video game knew how to make Aligned Metroplex chunky and thick like his G1 counterpart. The Thrilling 30 Titan ignored Metroplex's proper proportions just for to the sheer sake of making him as tall as possible a task that was quickly made in vain by TR Titan class Fort Max.

Learn about their inspiring journeys below…

Medical City Healthcare

Dallas Texas

Christine Seligman holds her newborn daughter Connlie after two HCA Healthcare facilities – Medical City Arlington and Medical City Children’s Hospital – work together to provide specialized lifesaving care for her newborn in Texas.

After welcoming their newborn daughter Connlie at Medical City Arlington Christine and Jordan Seligman spent just five blissful hours with her before the postnatal nurse noticed a blue spot on her back and whisked her away to the hospital’s high-level NICU. There the neonatologist diagnosed her with Tetralogy of Fallot — a combination of four severe congenital heart defects including a hole in her heart.

Connlie was immediately transferred by helicopter to the Heart Center at Medical City Children’s Hospital in Dallas where she received world-class congenital heart surgery. Perioperative imaging revealed that the only blood getting to Connlie’s lungs was from a small fetal blood vessel.

“Receiving this diagnosis postnatally was rough because we have two other children at home and we had to make life normal for them while also caring for our baby girl. That’s where Medical City Children’s Hospital stepped in. The nurses became our family. The doctors became our family. And we knew that when we weren’t there she was being well-loved and taken care of.” Christine Seligman HCA Healthcare patient and mother

Connlie underwent a complete repair to create a normal pathway for blood to go from her heart to her lungs. Dr. Poonam Thankavel a member of Connlie’s care team led by the Heart Center’s chief of congenital heart surgery Dr. Christine J. Guleserian says a successful outcome for their tiny patients depends on having a specialized team. “They walked us through each step” says Christine. “We knew we had a plan and we knew that we were constantly being watched over. We were very blessed that we had a successful surgery and that Connlie is doing well.”

TriStar Centennial Medical Center

Nashville Tennessee

HCA Healthcare nurse Celeste Wooten provides life-saving care to our tiniest patients at TriStar Centennial Medical Center in Nashville Tennessee.

HCA Healthcare nurse Celeste Wooten is part of the elite SkyLife Air Transport Team at TriStar Centennial Medical Center. She travels across the region to bring precious babies to Nashville to receive life-saving treatment in a specialized Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Celeste’s passion for caring for the tiniest of patients comes from her own personal journey – not once –but three times as a NICU mom.

Celeste feels like the NICU is a calling for her. Her oldest son now 11-years-old was born at 27 weeks and her middle son born at 30 weeks is now thriving at eight years old. Her youngest daughter is a rainbow baby – a healthy baby born after losing a baby due to miscarriage infant loss stillbirth or neonatal death – and she holds her close every day with a special necklace as she also spent time in the NICU.

It’s a gift that although painful at times Celeste feels led to share with others. “I feel like being here I can make an impact on all parents because I have been with the best memories and some of the worst memories” said Celeste.

HCA Healthcare’s TriStar Division debuted SkyLife Air Transport in 2021. Celeste was on the first flight to pick up a 30-week baby girl who would only spend a few weeks in the NICU before going home.

“It’s always a true blessing to see babies discharged from the NICU. It was very rewarding to watch this beautiful life be nursed to health by our team so she could go home with her family and continue to thrive.” Celeste Wooten HCA Healthcare nurse

Overland Park Regional Medical Center

Overland Park Kansas

Chad and Sarah Nelson serve as a March of Dimes Ambassador family.

Serving as a March of Dimes ambassador family is a source of pride for Chad and Sarah Nelson. It’s also a bittersweet reminder of the child they lost less than an hour after Sarah gave birth to identical twin sons on Jan. 7 2014. The Nelsons credit support from the March of Dimes – and love and support from their family and extended work families – as key factors in their resilience after such a tragic loss.

After developing Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS) – which causes uneven blood flow between the fetuses – Sarah delivered Benjamin and Andrew (Drew) prematurely at 27 weeks. Baby Drew’s 79-day journey in the NICU was just beginning as Chad and Sarah coped with his daily health turns while also grieving and planning baby Ben’s funeral. Drew left the hospital in April – just before the twins’ original due date.

“We were given information about all the support and resources available through the March of Dimes to help our family” said Chad. Chad is also an HCA Healthcare colleague serving as the manager of Outpatient Rehabilitation Services at Overland Park Regional Medical Center.

“We connected with a lot of families through March of Dimes. It’s good to know that you’re not the only ones going through something like this.” Chad Nelson HCA Healthcare colleague and father

In 2017 the Nelsons became an ambassador family and kicked off the March for Babies in Kansas City Missouri. They’ve become ardent supporters raising $20000 to assist the organization’s efforts to prevent prematurity – even ranking among the top 10 fundraisers in Kansas City in 2020.

Today Drew is a healthy active 8-year-old who enjoys playing with his sisters Mallory 10 and Carly 6. In Ben’s honor Chad and Sarah continue to share their story through the March of Dimes and area support groups for parents who’ve lost a twin to help others.

Methodist Children’s Hospital

San Antonio Texas

Baby Aubrey born at 32 weeks is thriving after spending 49 days in the NICU at Methodist Children’s Hospital in San Antonio Texas.

First-time mom Kaylyn DeAnda was overjoyed to learn she and her husband Kevin were expecting a little one to arrive in November 2021. Their joy was short-lived when they learned their baby girl Aubrey had omphalocele – an abdominal wall defect in which some of Aubrey’s organs were developing outside her body. This birth defect would require Aubrey to receive special care in a neonatal intensive care unit.

After researching their options Kaylyn sought out Level IV NICU care at HCA Healthcare affiliate Methodist Children’s Hospital in San Antonio Texas. Kaylyn found comfort in her birth plan and the plan of care for Aubrey that she developed with the hospital’s neonatologists and specialists.

“We knew we wanted Aubrey to be at the Methodist Children’s NICU” Kaylyn said. “Part of it was the NICU was well-equipped to care for her and the other part of it was having a perinatal navigator on board as someone who would help us with navigating and setting up appointments with different specialists and really take a bunch of the load off of our shoulders.”

In a turn of events Aubrey decided she was ready to make her entrance to the world at 32 weeks. After 49 days in the NICU Aubrey was able to go home where she continues to reach her milestones and is thriving. “Honestly we couldn’t ask for better [care]” Kaylyn said. “All of Aubrey’s doctors have been amazing.”

The Woman’s Hospital of Texas

Houston Texas

HCA Healthcare patient Toby Garza spent months in The Woman’s Hospital of Texas’ NICU after being born at 27 weeks.

On July 2 2008 Toby Garza was admitted to the Level IV NICU at HCA Healthcare’s The Woman’s Hospital of Texas after being born at 27 weeks and weighing only 1.10 pounds. Fast forward to July 2 2021 Toby was back in the Level IV NICU – but this time after 676 weeks of life and looking eye-to-eye with one of his nurses Micki who cared for him during his 11-week NICU stay.

Toby – along with his family and mother Rachel – returned to the Houston Texas-based hospital to celebrate the milestone birthday with the caregivers they credit it to. The family wanted to not only show their appreciation to the NICU nurses but also “show them the product of what they saved.”

Rachel explained that when she had to have an emergency cesarean delivery after suffering from a placental abruption she didn’t think they would celebrate any birthdays together. “I went into the OR thinking that was it I was going to lose my baby. I never thought we’d have 13 hours with him let alone 13 years.”

HCA Healthcare patient Toby Garza reunites with NICU Nurses for 13th birthday celebration.

In addition to the precious gift of seeing a 2008 NICU graduate again Rachel and her family treated the dedicated team of neonatal doctors nurses respiratory therapists and numerous support colleagues to an assortment of desserts and thank you notes from elementary school students.

Rachel will never forget the medical care Toby received during his nearly three-month NICU stay or the emotional support she was given from his nurses and the March of Dimes NICU Family Support Program. She said that because her family can never pay back those that cared for them they are passionate about paying it forward.

HCA Florida Brandon Hospital

Brandon Florida

HCA Healthcare patient Lauren Lantz helped to create HCA Florida Brandon Hospital NICU’s Family to Family Circle support group.

In 2008 HCA Healthcare patient and new mother Lauren Lantz returned home from HCA Florida Brandon Hospital in a wheelchair without her twin daughters who remained in the hospital’s Level III NICU. Next to her in the elevator was another mother in a wheelchair holding a beautiful baby. The emotion of the moment inspired a life-long commitment to share the message that ‘you’re not alone’ to NICU families through a special gift to mothers at discharge creating the NICU’s Family to Family Circle support group special remembrance during key holidays and active involvement with the March of Dimes by Lauren and her family.

Lauren and members of her church raised the money to provide the hospital’s NICU nurses with a special gift for mothers at discharge – a beautiful teddy bear to hold with a special letter from Lauren dated September 1 2008. In this letter Lauren shares “It’s okay to grieve for all those dreams of what you thought your birth experience might be and how they simply didn’t happen.” She ends her letter with “We hope to celebrate with you soon on the day that you do walk out of the hospital with full arms.”

Then and now: baby Tristan is a thriving three-year-old after entering the world at just 3 pounds 5 ounces.

“Tristan was born at 30 weeks five days on May 11 2018” said Carmen Duke. “He was in the NICU for eight weeks where he also underwent heart surgery.”

Tristan was born at HCA Healthcare’s Memorial Health in Savannah Georgia weighing only 3 pounds and 5 ounces to proud mom Carmen Duke. Lucky for Carmen – who also serves as the hospital’s director of infection prevention – she and her husband lived only two miles from the hospital so they were able to do kangaroo care every day.

“It was very important for me to breastfeed. I loved the support from the lactation consultants and the March of Dimes and NICU family support coordinator the neonatal team and others who provided support.” Carmen Duke HCA Healthcare colleague patient and mother

At three weeks old Tristan underwent successful heart surgery followed by a setback of a brain bleed. Carmen said they encountered difficulties but always celebrated the wins.

Present day Tristan is a thriving healthy three-year-old. Carmen says that she happily gives back to the March of Dimes for all the support given to her and her family.

On October 27 2021 Ella was born at 26 weeks weighing 1 pound 10 ounces. After receiving seven months of lifesaving care with the HCA Florida Healthcare system Ella graduated from the NICU and was able to go home with her mom dad and big sister Chloe.

Megan Toro had a healthy first pregnancy so she and her doctors had no reason to suspect anything different when she became pregnant again four years later. However – around 26 weeks – something felt strange with her second pregnancy.

Megan became lethargic and was suddenly very swollen. Her doctor advised her to go to the hospital and when she arrived her blood pressure was an alarming 160/100. “They needed to move me to a hospital with a NICU in case I had to deliver right away” said Megan.

After arriving at HCA Florida Lawnwood Hospital she spent a couple of days under the watchful eyes of physicians who discovered she had pulmonary edema. Her lungs were filling up with fluid and they needed to take the baby via cesarean section right away. At 26 weeks baby Ella was born weighing 1 pound 10 ounces on October 27 2021.

“Every single system in her body had a hit” said HCA Healthcare NICU nurse Kerry Shields who cared for Ella. “She was very critical when I met her.”

Besides Ella having a hole in her heart she encountered difficulty with her neck complications in her intestines became intubated and had a feeding tube placed. Doctors transferred her to the Level III NICU at Plantation General Hospital because she needed surgery to repair a spontaneous intestinal perforation. On November 15 2021 Ella went for her second ambulance ride when her physicians transferred her to a sister facility HCA Florida University Hospital. The brand new state-of-the-art Level III NICU would become her home for the next six months.

“It has been a rollercoaster so many ups and downs. But being here with the best care; the doctors nurses and therapists. Everyone is so incredible they are doing everything they can to save our baby.” Megan Toro HCA Healthcare patient and mom

Present day Ella now weighs 10 pounds and can finally eat on her own. Her care team says Ella is developing a personality she’s a survivor with a feisty spirit who loves bath time and being held. On May 2 2022 – after spending seven months in the NICU – Ella graduated and was able to go home with her mom dad and big sister Chloe. “We are eternally grateful that they made her so much better” Megan said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This time it’s a recall of Hunter Shepard from the AHL’s Hershey Bears. Shepard backed up Pheonix Copley in Hershey’s Game One loss to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins on Friday.

The American netminder has had a bit of a roller coaster of a season spending time at three separate levels of professional hockey. He had multiple stints with the Capitals taxi squad played in nine games for Hershey in the AHL and played in another 23 games for the South Carolina Stingrays of the ECHL.

NEWS | The Capitals have recalled goaltender Hunter Shepard from the Hershey Bears.#ALLCAPS | @FTX_Official https://t.co/bgzZOL9XBo — x – Washington Capitals (@Capitals) May 7 2022

The 26-year-old former NCAA standout had a 5-3-0 record with a 2.06 goals-against average .922 save percentage and one shutout with the Bears and a 12-9-2 record with a 2.88 goals-against average .917 save percentage and two shutouts for the Stingrays.

Like Fucale before him he is mostly on the playoff roster now just so that the Caps have a third goaltender on hand.

Here’s the full press release from the Capitals:

A small green-and-white oasis on the side of Route 70 West in Southampton Township the Evergreen Dairy Bar looks like a portal to an earlier place in time. Equal parts unassuming and intriguing this eatery has been on my radar as a spot to try for quite a while.

A Step Back in Time

The Evergreen serves up breakfast all day plus lunch and ice cream. I was overwhelmed with the menu choices of old-fashioned classic diner dishes plus cheesesteaks hoagies hot dogs and daily specials. With so many options I just couldn’t decide. I asked my server to tell me about the most popular lunch dishes.

Her recommendation was a club sandwich. My options included turkey ham and cheese grilled chicken chicken salad tuna salad hamburger or cheeseburger on my choice of toast. I went with a classic turkey club on rye but I upgraded the standard fries which come with the order to onion rings.

My made-to-order lunch came quickly. My sandwich was just as it should be with crisp bacon just the right amount of turkey and slathered with mayo. The onion rings were battered whole slices and super crispy. It was a simple lunch and when simple food is done well you just can’t go wrong.

Room for Dessert

A trip to a dairy bar just would not be complete without ice cream. The Evergreen Dairy Bar serves Hershey’s ice cream by the scoop in cups cones sundaes and banana splits. With a dozen delicious flavors to choose from this was another tough decision! My choice of a banana pudding ice cream sundae with caramel sauce and chocolate jimmies really hit the spot—and made me smile.

Looking for More?

Full and very happy with my lunch my next stop of the day was the Woodford Cedar Run Wildlife Refuge. Located in Medford NJ the Woodford Cedar Run Wildlife Refuge is a 170-acre not-for-profit wildlife refuge and rehabilitation hospital with a nature center picnic pavilion (with facility rentals) educational programs and special events. The refuge also offers hiking trails and a view of the animals currently in rehab within their natural habitat. (See website for hours and information.)

Ready to Explore

After arriving at the Refuge I checked in at the nature center where I visited a small reptile and amphibian room. I learned about local snakes turtles and frogs and then headed outside. After crossing a footbridge with a beautiful view of the lake I was able to visit a number of “residents” of the refuge including Hallie the bald eagle a number of native owls hawks falcons and vultures and even a friendly mallard duck who calls the refuge home.

I also saw a white-tailed deer a raccoon and a striped skunk relaxing. They stayed in their enclosures outside of the warm sun.

You can really spend quite a while observing the creatures and reading about each species. Some of the displays even have information on how to symbolically adopt the animals. This helps with the cost of their care.

The three trails offer views of the lake as well as informational plaques. Check them out to learn about the trees and vegetation native to the Pinelands. The trails are well marked and well maintained and have a few benches in case visitors need a place to stop and take in the peaceful surroundings."

Tell us about your background before law school.

I attended Stanford University and received my undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering and then received my MBA from the University of Michigan prior to obtaining my JD at Colorado Law. I feel fortunate to have started my career as a design engineer at Ford Motor Co. then working in product management for digital consumer products at Hewlett Packard Co. practicing IP litigation in private practice at two different firms and working in-house in IP transactions at Hewlett Packard Enterprise before joining the Department of Law. My vast experience working in various roles and industries prepared me for my current role.

Tell us about your work at the Colorado AG’s Office.

As the chief transformation officer I’m helping transform existing systems and processes to improve productivity and efficiency at the Department of Law. By embracing technology we are equipped to quickly innovate and implement creative solutions to meet the Department of Law’s business needs.

Example projects include transitioning the entire department to remote work implementing a new performance management program establishing a hybrid work culture implementing a new technology platform to become a more data-driven organization and many other transformation projects. Additionally as a first assistant attorney general I lead the Data Privacy team on rulemaking for the recently enacted Colorado Privacy Act.

What do you enjoy most about working in government?

I was initially drawn to working at the Department of Law because I wanted to utilize my skills to serve Colorado and help make a difference to ensure that Coloradans have access to justice and are able to continue to enjoy what makes Colorado such a great place to live.

What I enjoy the most is seeing how my work directly impacts Colorado and its people. I also really enjoy working with my colleagues at the Department of Law who are exemplary public servants. I am privileged to have the opportunity to work under the tutelage of Attorney General Phil Weiser and Chief Deputy Attorney General Natalie Hanlon Leh who have taught me how to become a better leader. I see firsthand their dedication to upholding the rule of law protecting Colorado and holding lawbreakers accountable.

Which law school experience(s) helped prepare you for your role and/or government work more generally?

While at Colorado Law I was a member of the Dean’s Diversity Committee because representation matters. It is important that people are able to show up as their authentic selves and have a sense of belonging whether at school or work. This inspired me to serve as the vice president of the Asian Pacific Law Student Association (APALSA) and join as a student member of the Asian Pacific American Bar Association (APABA). My early involvement in APALSA and APABA while in law school prepared me to later serve as the APABA president in 2020–21 during the pandemic. I feel honored to have served as APABA president during a tumultuous year which included the beginning of a pandemic racial justice crisis economic uncertainties the 2020 election the rise in hate crimes against the AAPI community the senseless Georgia hate shooting and the horrific shooting right here in my Boulder community.

Despite all these challenges I saw our community rise and support one another. The APABA board and especially APABA board member Deborah Yim who led the Community Outreach Committee worked together with other local organizations to sponsor a hate crimes webinar launch the free virtual APABA Cares legal clinic collect gift baskets and meals for seniors assemble Go Vote resources and video host an estate planning webinar and estate planning virtual clinic collect Lunar New Year gift baskets for refugee families sponsor the Addressing Asian Hate Town Hall compile the AAPI anti-hate brochure and many other activities.

I’m so proud of how much APABA accomplished during my term and what APABA continues to accomplish under the current president Clark Yeh. I bring my APABA experiences to my current role as I continue to advocate for diversity equity and inclusion in my day-to-day work and in the programs I implement.

What advice would you give to law students interested in pursuing a career in government?

I highly encourage law students interested in pursuing a career in government to reach out to attorneys working in government to get a better understanding of the work they do the path they took toward becoming a public servant and why they pursued a career in government. Another way to learn more about government work is to apply for internships—at the Colorado Attorney General’s Office or elsewhere—to learn more about becoming a government attorney. For me working in government has provided me with a sense of purpose and fulfillment that no other job has. I am thankful to Colorado Law for opening the door for me to become a public servant.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vc2lsaWNvbmFuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA1LzA3L21heS1ub3Qta25vdy1kZWxsLXNub3dmbGFrZS1kZWFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What you may not know about the Dell-Snowflake deal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://siliconangle.com/2022/05/07/may-not-know-dell-snowflake-deal/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vc2lsaWNvbmFuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA1LzA3L21heS1ub3Qta25vdy1kZWxsLXNub3dmbGFrZS1kZWFsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Hedge fund owner Soo Kim says the rebranded casino company will deliver.,"When Mayor Lori Lightfoot named Bally’s the winner of a yearlong vetting process Thursday it ended an intense competition that saw five proposals from four development teams narrowed down to one Chicago casino.

The Bally’s proposal to build a $1.74 billion casino complex in River West is expected to generate $200 million in annual tax revenue for the city transform a 30-acre industrial site into a bustling entertainment destination and send the Chicago Tribune printing plant packing from its longtime home along the Chicago River.

For Soo Kim the 47-year-old chairman of Bally’s and founding partner of New York hedge fund Standard General the casino company’s largest shareholder staking turf in Chicago will be no less transformative.

“This matters to our company” Kim said Friday. “This is something that will be our most important property by far.”

Once a Chicago-based casino operator the Bally’s name was purchased in 2020 by Twin River Holdings a publicly traded Rhode Island company which owns and manages 14 casinos across 10 states. In June 2021 Bally’s made its entree into Illinois with the $120 million acquisition of Jumer’s Casino & Hotel in Rock Island which it renamed Bally’s Quad Cities.

Bally’s CEO Soo Kim listens May 5 2022 during a news conference announcing Bally’s Casino in River West is the pick for Chicago’s gambling complex.

Kim is looking to make Chicago the flagship of Bally’s 2.0 a hodgepodge of properties from Nevada to Atlantic City New Jersey assembled in large part during the darkest days of the pandemic.

“During COVID we went shopping and we bought 10 casinos” said Kim. “We bought the brand name as part of one of the purchases and that really changed our company in a big way.”

Born in Korea and raised in Queens New York Kim has been placing increasingly big bets on investment opportunities since graduating from Princeton. He started his career as an analyst at Bankers Trust in 1997 before working at several large hedge funds. In 2007 he launched Standard General a New York-based hedge fund that has focused on TV stations casinos and other distressed properties.

Standard General bought into the predecessor casino company Twin River after it emerged from bankruptcy in 2011. Kim joined the board in 2016 and became chairman in late 2019 as the hedge fund built up a 22% stake. A January bid by Standard General to buy out the other shareholders at $38 per share which valued Bally’s at $2.07 billion was rejected by a special committee of the board Thursday.

“It’s over” Kim said. “We made a bid. We thought that the stock was cheap. They said they don’t want to sell at that price.”

During the pandemic the casino company went on an opportunistic buying spree as casinos temporarily shuttered and valuations plummeted. In 2020 Twin River bought the aging Bally’s casino in Atlantic City from Caesars Entertainment for $25 million and also acquired the rights to the Bally’s name. The rebranded Bally’s has since invested $100 million in renovating the Atlantic City property but developing the proposed Chicago casino represents a much bigger commitment — and opportunity.

Bally’s reported $548.3 million in revenue and a net income of $1.9 million during the first quarter according to financial results announced Thursday. The company projected revenue between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion for the year.

In 2021 Bally’s generated $1.32 billion in revenue and a net loss of nearly $72 million.

The city and its casino consultant Las Vegas-based Union Gaming projected that Bally’s Chicago casino would generate $816 million in annual adjusted gross receipts — the money kept after winnings are paid out — by year six or roughly a third of the chain’s entire current gaming revenue.

Rivers Casino Des Plaines the state’s highest-grossing casino generated $458 million in adjusted gross receipts last year according to the Illinois Gaming Board.

The Chicago casino would be the largest in the state with a capacity of 4000 gaming positions — twice those allowed at any other casino in Illinois. It would also carry with it the highest casino tax rate in the state at about 40% of adjusted gross revenue.

Kim is confident Bally’s will hit its targets but some analysts are skeptical.

“I don’t think those projections will be met” said Alan Woinski president of Gaming USA a Florida-based industry analyst.

Woinski said city casinos have had a rough track record in recent years and that locations on the outskirts of cities often do better. He cited “ease of access” as the main factor in a casino’s success.

Chris Grove a partner with Eilers & Krejcik Gaming a California-based research and consulting firm said the potential market in Chicago justified the city’s revenue projections. But Grove a River North resident likewise cautioned that the Bally’s location may limit the upside.

“I think there are some serious questions that still need to be answered about how you move people in and out of that area efficiently in a way that feels like a positive experience to them” Grove said. “And as a local I don’t see obvious answers to that challenge with infrastructure as it is.”

The dog park in A. Montgomery Ward Park in the River North neighborhood sits opposite the projected casino site divided by the Chicago River May 4 2022.

The city is planning extensive roadwork improvements at the site including widening the Chicago Avenue bridge to alleviate the existing traffic bottleneck. The need to get a jump on that project derailed Bally’s plans to use a former Tribune Publishing warehouse at 700 W. Chicago Ave. as its temporary casino while Freedom Center is demolished and the permanent facility is built.

At the city’s urging Bally’s signed a letter of intent to use the landmark Medinah Temple building in River North as its temporary casino. Kim said Friday he would prefer the Chicago Avenue site and was “not crazy” about switching to Medinah Temple. Bally’s will continue to look for alternatives for its temporary casino he said.

In March Lightfoot narrowed down five proposals to three finalists: Bally’s at the Chicago Tribune Publishing Center Rivers at The 78 in the South Loop and Hard Rock at the proposed One Central development on the Near South Side.

In addition to an upfront payment of $40 million the city cited Bally’s as the only bidder that does not already have a casino property in the Chicago area making it more likely to operate independently and maximize revenues for the Chicago casino.

Florida-based Hard Rock International operates more than a dozen casinos including a Hard Rock Casino in Gary and a recently opened casino in Rockford. Chicago-based Rush Street Gaming owns four casinos including Rivers Casino Des Plaines.

The city projects that the Chicago casino will “repatriate” up to $331 million in gaming revenue that crosses the border into Indiana each year. The Chicago casino may also siphon some dollars from the competing suburban casinos.

Rivers Casino Des Plaines does not expect to lose any ground to Bally’s Chicago.

“Rivers Des Plaines is the most successful casino in the state and the vast majority of its business comes from within 20 miles of the property” Tim Drehkoff CEO of Rush Street Gaming said in an emailed statement. “Rush Street’s bid for the Chicago opportunity recognized the tremendous opportunity for the City and its selected partner to capture gaming customers heading to Indiana.”

A spokesperson for Hard Rock declined to comment Friday.

Kim said Bally’s may have “some impact” on the suburban casinos but he expects to grow the gaming market by drawing tourists to a Chicago casino.

Despite his concerns about access Grove said having a casino in the city will open the door to significant new tourism and entertainment dollars at Bally’s.

“I don’t know that a trip out to Des Plaines or a trip over to Hammond is really in the itinerary of someone coming to Chicago for a weekend or coming in for a convention for a couple of days” Grove said. “But you put a casino in the city and all of a sudden that becomes a lot easier to make.”

The Bally’s complex will include an exhibition hall a 500-room hotel a 3000-seat theater an outdoor music venue six restaurants and a casino with 3400 slots and 170 game tables. It will also feature a name with a colorful history in Chicago.

Founded in 1932 as a Chicago-based pinball manufacturer Bally’s is a storied company that diversified into everything from casinos to health clubs over the years before selling off its parts and fading into corporate obscurity in the new millennium.

Chicago-based Bally Entertainment spun off its fitness division Bally’s Health & Tennis ? then the nation’s largest chain of health clubs — in 1995. Bally Total Fitness filed for bankruptcy protection twice during the Great Recession and is now defunct.

In 1996 Bally Entertainment — the casino parent company that had properties in Las Vegas and Atlantic City — was acquired by Hilton Hotels Corp. for $3 billion including the assumption of $1 billion in Bally’s debt. The gaming division of Hilton evolved into Caesars Entertainment the largest casino company in the world.

Bally’s CEO Soo Kim right arrives May 5 2022 for the announcement that Bally’s Casino in River West is the pick for Chicago’s gambling complex.

When Kim acquired the rights to the Bally’s name in 2020 Caesars retained the name for its Las Vegas casino. But Caesars is expected to rebrand it as a Horseshoe property when Bally’s closes on its $150 million acquisition of the Tropicana in Las Vegas which it agreed to buy more than a year ago.

Kim said the Tropicana will join the fold and take the Bally’s name in the late second or early third quarter.

Bally’s still has some business to take care of before launching in Chicago including finding a new home for the Chicago Tribune printing plant.

The casino company has an option to buy the 30-acre site Freedom Center from Dallas-based Nexstar Media Group which acquired it in 2019 as part of its $4.1 billion purchase of Tribune Media — the former broadcast parent of Tribune Publishing. The Bally’s plan requires demolishing the 41-year-old plant and relocating the Tribune printing operations to make way for building the permanent casino.

Bally’s also needs to win over a majority of aldermen at the City Council and then win approval from the Illinois Gaming Board.

If approved Bally’s aims to open a temporary casino by the second quarter of 2023 with the permanent casino slated to open in the first quarter of 2026.

Kim said Bally’s is up to the challenge of building the ambitious casino complex. And he discounted suggestions that Bally’s was given a glide path to the project by the city noting the scope of the proposal doubled at the city’s behest.

“We believe very firmly that we’ve won on the merits that the city has driven a hard bargain” Kim said.

LOUIS — What the Wild is calling a tip jar is making its way around the locker room but this isn't the dish on the counter at Starbucks that's stuffed with loose change.

The team is passing around a pail that looks like it belongs on a construction site and the player of the game tosses in the puck from each playoff victory.

""To be able to celebrate it in a fun way with your teammates is definitely something you cherish"" Jon Merrill said. ""We hope to fill that thing all the way up.""

Marcus Foligno designed the container — ""The bubble letters on there are mine"" he said — and the idea came from a road trip in Nashville last month when the Wild bonded while tipping to make song requests.

""We were at Dierks Bentley's bar"" Foligno said ""and I just remember seeing this Home Depot bucket and this guy came around at last call and started going around like at church when they collect money. So it was just one of those things where guys were throwing dollar bills in there and asking for recommendations. It was just comical.""

Joel Eriksson Ek was the first recipient after Game 2 and then Marc-Andre Fleury dumped in the second puck after the Wild ran away from the Blues 5-1 on Friday to take a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven series.

""We didn't really do anything this year when it came to player of the game during the season"" Foligno said. ""So I just thought playoffs and then the puck acts as the money. We need 16 wins so we hope we can get that tip jar full.""

Staying disciplined

The Blues' Pavel Buchnevich interfered with Foligno to negate a St. Louis power play late in the second period Friday and after the call was made Foligno made a beeline for the bench instead of engaging Buchnevich.

That was one of many examples of the discipline the Wild had on display in Game 3 a poise the Wild was lacking earlier in the series.

""We ran around a lot in Game 1 and it wasn't our style and we were all over the refs and just we weren't focusing our attention on the Blues"" Foligno said. ""You kind of saw it [Friday] night. They had a lot of guys running around and we had a lot of guys that took hits. But everyone's feeling good today.

""So it's one of those things where we're just ready for it and it's good to see our team kind of learn lessons.""

St. Louis ended up outhitting the Wild 33-17 but the physicality didn't rattle the Wild.

""There's some big clean hits that they delivered and you just gotta move on"" Foligno continued. ""It's the playoffs. They were the second power play in the league all season for a reason so we don't want to do anything ourselves to retaliate or get ticked off. So we did a good job.""

On the move

Fleury is one win away from moving into sole possession of third place in NHL history for postseason victories.

The Wild goaltender tied Hall of Famer and five-time Stanley Cup champion Grant Fuhr on Friday at 92.

""I'm sure I've played a lot more games than he has to get there"" said Fleury who reached the milestone in his 165th playoff game while Fuhr totaled 150. ""I think he was spectacular. Sometimes he would give up some goals but he would always find a way to finish up games and win games. He's got so many championships and went to the Finals so many times. He's obviously a legend.""

Another Blues injury

St. Louis defenseman Torey Krug who left Game 3 with a lower-body injury will miss ""some time"" Blues coach Craig Berube said.

Nick Leddy and Robert Bortuzzo skated Saturday but it's unclear if either defenseman will return from their respective upper-body injuries to suit up Sunday afternoon after sitting out Game 3.

As for Scott Perunovich who hasn't played since undergoing wrist surgery in March Berube called the Hibbing native and former Minnesota Duluth standout a possibility.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA1LzA4L21pc3NpbmctZG9nLWZvdW5kLWluLW5qLWFmdGVyLWVhc3Qtcml2ZXItc3dpbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Missing dog found in NJ after East River swim run through Battery tunnel,"A spunky Big Apple dog who ran away over a week ago was found safe Sunday after sending rescuers on a multi-state hunt that started in the East River and ended at a Home Depot in New Jersey The Post has learned.

Bailey a seven-month old German Shepherd-Akita mix broke out of his owner’s Red Hook yard last Friday and took a dip in the East River close to IKEA soon after said Harriet Zucker a dog trainer who helped track the pooch down.

A researcher who was doing work on a barge spotted Bailey “swimming around” at around noon that day and got on his paddle board to help the pup get back to shore. But Bailey who is very fearful of humans and has behavioral issues kept swimming away said Zucker.

The man was eventually able to herd the dog back to shore where he collapsed on the rocks and spent several hours sunbathing before vanishing once again Zucker said.

“We were trying to figure out where he was so we could set up feeding stations then maybe trap him” she told The Post.

“There was nothing at all no sightings nothing.”

A few days later Zucker plastered missing posters around Red Hook and soon got a tip that Bailey had been spotted near Henry Street and Hamilton Avenue close to the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel entrance.

“Then I got another message that he was in the tunnel” Zucker laughed.

On Saturday video posted to Twitter showed Bailey galloping through the tunnel as a New York State trooper trailed behind him shocking motorists who filmed the wild moment.

“Oh he’s coming in our lane!” a passenger who thought Bailey was a wolf or coyote is heard saying in the video as the pooch darted through cars.

“This is insane!”

4 Bailey escaped from his owner’s yard in Red Hook Brooklyn last week. Twitter 4 A person posted a video on Twitter of Bailey running inside the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel. Twitter

Zucker spoke to an officer manning the tunnel and said Bailey exited in Manhattan and “got out at Trinity Street.”

“You should go into Manhattan and ask them” the officer said according to Zucker.

She canvassed downtown but came up empty and planned to spend Sunday posting fliers in Lower Manhattan — when she got a call saying Bailey had crossed state lines and was tracked by Port Authority police to a Home Depot parking lot in Jersey City.

“It was pretty surprising that he ended up in New Jersey which is quite an adventure for a puppy that’s never been outside before” said Zucker.

4 Bailey ended up being found in a Home Depot parking lot in Jersey City. Twitter 4 Dog trainer Harriet Zucker is in the process of reuniting the dog with his owner. Twitter

“The most amazing thing to me is just the journey that he took.”

Aside from a nasty wound on his leg Bailey was safe and healthy albeit a bit thinner from a week on the streets said Zucker.

She’s in the process of reuniting Bailey with his owner and finding a foster for him who can help the pup become less fearful and more adjusted to humans.

“There’s a lot of hope for him he’s a nice dog” said Zucker.

“I do think he’s going to be a big snuggle. He needs a person that he’ll know has his back all the time.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXRlcnRvd25tYW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvMDgvcG9saWNlLWxvZy1mb3VyLW1lbi1hcnJlc3RlZC1vbi1ndW4tY2hhcmdlLWZvcm1lci1sYW5kbG9yZC1jbGFzaGVzLXdpdGgtZm9ybWVyLXRlbmFudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Police Log: Four Men Arrested on Gun Charge Former Landlord Clashes with Former Tenant,"The following information was provided by the Watertown Police Department.

The larger companies would pledge to help train workers at these SMEs to make the products and help develop common development and certification standards for “additive manufacturing” otherwise known as 3D printing.

Dubbed “Additive Manufacturing Forward” or “AM Forward” the initiative involves voluntary commitments from some of America’s largest manufacturers including aerospace giant GE Aviation and leading defence contractor Raytheon to source more 3D printed parts from smaller companies.

US President Joe Biden‘s administration announced on Friday a new initiative that would boost manufacturing of 3D printed products by domestic small- and medium-enterprises (SMEs) an effort that the White House hopes will work in conjunction with legislation meant to boost US competitiveness against China.

At an event attended by executives from some of America’s largest manufacturers Biden touted the potential 3D printing has to offer economically and from a national security perspective.

“The executives here today have agreed to launch a new compact between large iconic manufacturers and smaller American suppliers a commitment by these large companies to help those smaller ones adapt new technologies so we can continue to be the leading exporter of aircrafts and engines in areas like medical devices clean energy technologies and so much more” he said.

While Biden’s policies have diverged from the priorities of his immediate predecessor former president Donald Trump particularly on social issues and the environment he has so far kept hard-line policies on China intact including efforts to reduce American reliance on manufacturing in the country.

The US leader also reiterated a call for Congress to speed up passage of legislation that would provide billions of US dollars in funding for domestic semiconductor manufacturing and other provisions meant to counter China.

“We were ranked number one in the world in [research and development] three decades ago” Biden said. “Now we’re ranked number nine in the world. China was number eight in the world 30 years ago. Now they’re number two in the world. We’ve got to up our game.”

What the White House refers to as the Bipartisan Innovation Act is what will emerge from Congress assuming that the House of Representatives and the Senate manage to agree on provisions in China-related bills that each chamber has already passed.

The House passed its America Competes Act in February last year and the Senate passed its US Innovation and Competition Act four months later.

Provisions for 3D printing in USICA are part of some US$23 billion worth of funding that the bill would allocate for the development of high-tech priorities including aeronautics and space technology.

“Advanced materials and manufacturing processes including additive manufacturing to reduce the cost of manufacturing scale-up and certification for use in general aviation commercial aviation and military aeronautics” are called for under the heading of “experimental aircraft projects”.

In-situ additive manufacturing shows up in the legislation under the “Mars-forward technologies” heading along with other technologies including nuclear propulsion and cryogenic fluid management.

As part of AM Forward GE Aviation will target SME suppliers to compete on 50 per cent of its requests for products made using 3D printing or related technologies and will target 30 per cent of its total external sourcing of additively manufactured parts from domestic SMEs according to the White House fact sheet.

Lockheed Martin another participant in the initiative will work with its SME suppliers to conduct research to improve the performance of additive manufacturing AM techniques specifically focused on the use of 3D printing as an alternative to the manufacture of products through the more traditional use of castings and forgings it said.

Honeywell and Siemens Energy are also among the inaugural participants in AM Forward.

In a report on 3D printing prepared for US lawmakers in 2019 the Congressional Research Service — Congress’s public policy research arm — noted that 3D printing can be faster cheaper and more flexible than conventional production methods given 3D printers’ lower prices easily modifiable digital designs and ability to integrate multiple distinct manufacturing processes into a single operation.

The White House pledged support for AM Forward SMEs involved in the initiative through federal programmes.

For example the Small Business Administration would extend loans and Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) programme “can support the widespread deployment of new additive capabilities across US industry” it said.

You can fry it up and serve it with scrambled eggs you can put it in grilled cheese or you can serve it in fried rice. That's right: It's Spam! No we're not talking about those trashy e-mails that flood your inbox. We're talking about that classic tin of processed lunchmeat. With over 100 recipes or so Spam says that you can make using only a hunk of Spam and a few ingredients this meaty treat has become a cheap and delicious staple of the American dining scene.

According to Eater Spam first appeared all the way back in 1937 as the end result of Hormel Foods' endeavor to both produce a non-perishable meat item and sell off excess pork shoulder. However this canned meat product only began to take off during World War II and the post-war era. Of course there were those who found Spam to be something of a joke food from U.S. soldiers sending Hormel letters of disgust at Spam and those who considered it a ""white trash food"" (via The Takeout). But Spam found a market not only on the U.S. mainland but also in Hawaii Korea and the Philippines. In the Philippines for example a breakfast of spamislog consists of garlic fried rice fried eggs and a few slices of fried Spam (via SBS Food).

Today Spam is getting more and more popular from the beaches of Hawaii to the high-class halls of art museums. How can such a cheap tin of pink pork product leave such an impact?",,,,,,,,,,,,

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

This Chevelle is one of the coolest resto-mods to ever hit up AutotopiaLA.

The 1966 Chevrolet Chevelle is one of the most popular models to ever hit the Chevy production line because of its unique styling high performance and intense reputation for being America's favorite muscle car. With swooping body lines flared fenders and a tastefully crafted roofline which essentially made the A-body platform as popular as it is today. That means that the first-generation Chevelle is considered by many to be the pinnacle of the muscle car movement of the 1960s. So naturally this makes these cars the best choice for restorations but the famous resto-mod project is an even more popular option for these vehicles.

This widebody Chevelle is the perfect example of that automotive adventure that has taken over the modern car culture that we all know and love today. Under the hood is a 565 cubic-inch Chevy V8 engine which produces over 900 horsepower which is more than enough to burn the rubber straight off the tires with ease. All of that power is sent through a high-performance manual transmission which is a beautiful choice for this high horsepower beast. It is straightforward to hear that this car has an exceptionally high performance based on the exhaust note which roars like a pride of lions through the side-exit exhaust.

The body alone has been extended by six inches on each fender giving this extremely low-slung beast a dominating road presence. This is further helped by the deep dish wheels which are so incredibly concave that they look like you could sleep in them. Over $500000 has been poured into the beautiful car which seems wholly justified upon looking at the vehicle. Thousands of hours of human resources material and design went into this car which is highly prevalent throughout the build. This is one of the most fantastic cars we've seen resto-mod or otherwise and we hope to see many more like it as automotive technology advances.

These proceeds are slated to become sunk into the latter's new-found enthusiasm for areas such as ""blockchain AI and the cloud"".

4 Reviews

The Swedish conglomerate Embracer Group (formerly THQ Nordic AB) touts itself as taking an increasingly eponymous role in the production and distribution of gaming assets. It has already engulfed Dark Horse Easybrain and Asmodee and is thus associated with franchises including Saints Row Borderlands Darksiders and Goat Simulator. Now it has turned similar attention on titles classically linked to Square Enix.

The Group has confirmed reports of its agreement to acquire the IP for games that include legacy titles such as Legacy of Kain Deus Ex and Thief in addition to Crystal Dynamics' Tomb Raider. They are to be off-loaded along with 50 more ""back-catalog"" games thought to include the oft-benighted Marvel Studios IP.

On that note their studios' (Square Enix Montréal and Eidos-Montréal included) staff members may also have a change of employer soon. None of this is final at present however although Embracer Group has already revealed that it will hand about US$300 million over to the seller should the deal go though.

The government has ordered the implementation of this change within the next two years reported Bloomberg. The staff has been instructed to swap out their foreign PCs for domestic alternatives that operate on locally designed software.

The report added that the initiative is expected to replace 50 million computers in the central government alone. The decision boosts China’s decade-long push to replace imported technology with domestic alternatives a broad endeavor to minimize the country’s reliance on global rivals like the United States for everything from chips to servers and phones.

HP and Dell Technologies the country’s largest PC brands after domestic manufacturer Lenovo would be phased out under the new strategy. In the fourth quarter of 2021 China’s PC shipments increased by 9% to 16.5 million units according to Canalys.

Furthermore the Chinese market ended a year of tremendous growth with shipments rising 10% to a record 57 million units in 2021. Lenovo had 41.8 percent of the market share followed by Dell (12.5 percent) HP (9.2 percent) Asus (5.5 percent) and Acer (5.2 percent).

“China’s PC market is undergoing upheaval due to public sector interventions but the strong growth in 2021 emphasizes how big an opportunity there still is” said Emma Xu Canalys analyst.

“Security concerns about government procurement are growing and there is a preference for local vendors which puts additional competitive pressure on US-based vendors such as HP and Dell.”

According to the report HP-branded workstations were still accessible for purchase on a website used by key government procurement authorities as of Friday (May 6). However it was unknown whether transactions would be completed.

The directive is anticipated to cover only PC brands and software excluding difficult-to-replace components like Intel and AMD processors. Beijing also intends to promote Linux-based operating systems as a viable alternative to Microsoft Windows. Standard Software centered in Shanghai is a leading vendor of these technologies.

Beijing’s rising concerns about information security and confidence in local hardware are reflected in the latest PC replacement program. Later the campaign will be expanded to provincial governments with the same two-year deadline.

US-China Tech War

China has consistently promoted the use of homegrown IT goods in government institutions. To tackle this US software giants such as Microsoft and HP have formed joint ventures with Chinese government-backed organizations to continue obtaining orders from the country’s biggest state-owned enterprises.

The latest policy is believed to be the outcome of the Chinese government’s rising concerns about information security and faith in its hardware. This decision will benefit China’s top laptop and server manufacturers including Lenovo Huawei and Inspur while other domestic developers like Kingsoft and Standard Software would like to capture the market share from Microsoft and Adobe.

Under the new rules certain agencies can continue to buy advanced foreign technology with special permission. TCL Technology the Shanghai Data Exchange and public transportation operator MTR Corporation are among the companies that could be affected by this policy.

Due to shortcomings in Chinese-developed software consumers in China had to rely on imported technology in the past. This has altered in recent years with local manufacturers such as Lenovo and Inspur gaining global market share even though their devices still rely on key US-made components such as Intel or AMD processors.

In recent years the West has taken a step back from Chinese technology companies. To prevent the Chinese army from obtaining access to sensitive US technologies the US Department of Commerce incorporated a dozen Chinese technology companies into its trade blacklist in November 2021.

In March 2022 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ordered a Chinese Telecom company to stop offering domestic interstate and international communication services within the United States citing the need to protect the country’s telecommunications infrastructure from potential security risks.

Chinese technology companies have suffered a major setback following a shift in Western policy towards businesses perceived as close to Beijing. One of the biggest sufferers is Huawei whose equipment got banned in several countries including the United States and the United Kingdom.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jdXJyZW50LWFmZmFpcnMva2hhbGlzdGFuLWZsYWdzLWh1bmctYXQtaHAtYXNzZW1ibHktZW50cmFuY2UtZ2F0ZS1jbS1zYXlzLWNvd2FyZGx5LWFjdC0xMjIwNTA4MDAyOTJfMS5odG1s0gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzLXN0YW5kYXJkLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9jdXJyZW50LWFmZmFpcnMva2hhbGlzdGFuLWZsYWdzLWh1bmctYXQtaHAtYXNzZW1ibHktZW50cmFuY2UtZ2F0ZS1jbS1zYXlzLWNvd2FyZGx5LWFjdC0xMjIwNTA4MDAyOTJfMS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Khalistan flags hung at HP Assembly entrance gate CM says 'cowardly act',"Khalistan flags were found tied on the main gate and slogans written on the walls of the Himachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly police said on Sunday.

It might have happened in the late night or early morning today. We have removed the Khalistani flags from Vidhan Sabha gate. we are investing and going to register a case SP Kangra Khushal Sharma said.

SDM Dharamshala Shilpi Beakta said ""It is an alert call for us.""



""We received an information this morning at around 7.30am. We have removed the flags and walls have been painted again. We are inquiring about the matter and are going to register a case under relevant sections of Himachal Pradesh Open Places Prevention of Disfigurement Act 1985. Rest details can be shared after investigation"".

Local MLA Vishal Nehria said termed the incident disgusting and an act of cowardice carried out in the darkness of night.

""We the Himachalis and the Indians are not afraid of any threats from the supporters of so-called Khalistan the MLA said.

The National Secretary of Congress Sudhir Sharma also termed the incident as unfortunate.

It is unfortunate that the flag of Khalistan at the entrance of the Dharamsala assembly and slogans are written on the walls while the non-working of CCTV and the absence of security personnel raises question marks on the administration and security agencies. Recently the efforts being made to create such an environment in Punjab and Himachal are a matter of concern. We the people of Himachal will give our lives for the integrity of the country but we will not allow such forces to flourish. Jai Hind he tweeted."

Written by Jameca Patrick-Singleton

Yvonne Penton became pregnant at just 15 years old.

“I was my dad’s only daughter” she said.

Penton’s father said she would help her.

With her family’s support Penton was not only able to raise her daughter in a positive environment but she also finished high school and obtained both a bachelor’s and master’s degree. An understanding of the roadblocks faced by pregnant teens without a lot of options is what fueled Penton’s passion and desire to start a program called House of Esther a residential based program for teen moms and their small children.

“It’s always been my passion because I was one of those girls” Penton explained. “I was a pregnant teen.”

House of Esther is a 21-room program that is designed to allow pregnant teenagers to live complete their educations access resources and create a strong healthy familial type bond with each other the staff and their mentors during the time that they are pregnant and 12 months after while still living at House of Esther. Each room has been adopted and designed by community members churches and organizations.

“We have several partners U of M Nursing all three colleges Habitat for Humanity Huntington Bank. They are willing to help these young moms many homeless or aging out of foster care.”

While House of Esther is currently connecting pregnant moms to resources they have yet to accept their first live-in resident-despite being having a location in the 500 block of West Pierson Road.

“In 2016 we found this location and the owners gave us permission to occupy the buildings that once occupied the church and the perish but we weren’t able to get water because the way the campus is set up. All of the meters are in the former school that’s on the campus.”

There needs to be a pipe laid by the city to have water independently accessed by the buildings occupied by House of Esther. According to Penton this request was made to the City of Flint in 2020. Penton claims that the city hasn’t done its part to allow the water to be turned on but is now condemning the building for that very reason.

In addition the city has stated that the House of Ester hasn’t paid back property taxes that were part of the agreement to take ownership of the building.

“They’re saying that the buildings are a safety hazard because there is no water. We know that which is why we asked them to help us.”

Community activists are rallying around House of Esther asking the city to rescind its decision to condemn the building.

“Councilwoman Burns and Councilman Mays are trying to help us get a meeting with the city to help resolve the issue. I am in this to help these young women and their children. I want them to know that their history does not define their destiny.”",,,,,,,,,

May 8 2016

IBM generated a lot of publicity and a little controversy last week when they announced the IBM Quantum Experience that allows members of the general public to configure and run programs on a 5 qubit quantum computer that they have made available on the web. IBM granted me access to this capability and I have been using it for the past few days and here are my first impressions.

Although 5 cubits is certainly not enough to outperform a classical computer it is enough to let someone play around and test some basic concepts of quantum computing. The IBM Quantum Experience consists of a User Guide that is split into six sections and provides a good primer on the basics of quantum computing. The second section is a composer that allows you to drag and drop gates into something that IBM calls a “score” which looks something similar to a music score. A blank score looks like this:

You can configure your quantum algorithm by dragging and dropping the collection of gates as shown in the colored shapes at the bottom of the screen. IBM supplies eight single qubit gates one 2-qubit CNOT gate two measurement gates and one idle gate. The CNOT gate plus the collection of single qubit gates comprise a universal set that would allow one to synthesize any quantum algorithm. The picture below shows a simple example after a score is configured:

Once you have a configured score you have the choice of running it and seeing the results in one of three ways:

Run on a simulator of an ideal quantum processor. Ideal means there would be no decoherence errors. Run on a simulator of a real quantum processor. This realistic simulation would take into account a probabilistic model of what errors may occur to decoherence. Run the score on the actual quantum processor that IBM has put on the web. Since there may be multiple users who are doing this or the processor may be unavailable for temporary maintenance IBM will queue up the requests and run these in a batch mode. After your job is done IBM will store the results in the data base and send you an email notifying you that the job has completed.

There is no limit to the number of simulator runs allowed. However IBM does ration the number of runs on the actual processor with a system of processing units that they will periodically provide you.

You can view the results section to see the final output. Depending upon what type of measurement block you put at the end it will show you a bar chart showing the probabilities of each end state or it will show you a Bloch sphere that will show the complete state of the qubit in three dimensions.

Example of a Bar Chart Showing Distributions

Example showing the Bloch measurement of the individual qubits.

IBM deserves a lot of credit for implementing this. It is a good tool for students and researchers. But it is not clear if there is any value outside of the “gee whiz” value of including an actual quantum processor with this. At 5-qubits the simulator will provide almost the same results and we would not be able to tell the difference. Google and Microsoft have created similar capabilities but did not promote it as much as IBM did. Google released the Quantum Computer Playground in 2014 and Microsoft released last a full simulator called LIQUi|> standing for Language-Integrated Quantum Operations. But I like IBM’s capability more at least from an educational standpoint because of its nice graphical user interface and the tutorial included in the user guide.

The only point of controversy is whether the IBM Marketing folks might have been a little too enthusiastic by hinting that this was a full capability open to the general public rather than just some educational and experimental technology they are making available to students and researchers.. The title of their press release was “IBM Makes Quantum Computing Available on IBM Cloud” and the release did get heavy play in the general media. For an alternate view you can read Chris Williams opinion as published in the TheRegister. In some of the press statements IBM seems to be indicating that their direction for real commercialization is to make quantum computing available in the cloud. This coincides with a believe that many folks hold including myself. But even then it may be several years before this becomes a reality and even then it will generate just a very small fraction of IBMs total yearly revenue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZ2luZWVyaW5nLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9jeWJlcmNyaW1pbmFscy1sb3ZlLXRoZS1tdWx0aWNsb3VkLXNvLWhvdy1jYW4td2UtbWFrZS1pdC1zYWZlctIBLWh0dHBzOi8vbW9iaWxlLmVuZ2luZWVyaW5nLmNvbS9hbXAvMjQ0OTkuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cybercriminals Love the Multicloud; So How Can We Make It Safer?,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlcmFsZG1haWxtZWRpYS5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy9waGFnMDIwNjE3MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert L. Hoffman Obituary,"Robert Lynwood Hoffman born in Hagerstown MD on November 22 1929 was an IBM-NASA Project Mercury Gemini and Apollo space-flights computer programmer as well as a graduate of the University of Virginia (UVA) and a Korean War veteran. Bob was also a devoted husband proud father and grandfather. He died November 14 2021 a week shy of age 92. Services will take place in May 2022.

The eldest son of the late Clyde Martin Hoffman and Helen Rebecca (Carter/Fritz) Hoffman Bob was preceded in passage by his parents (1998; ‘86) infant sister Charlotte Ruth (1928) and his beloved wife of 54 years Dorothy (Dot) Lee (Blackwell/Short) Hoffman (2010). Bob’s numerous accomplishments began at Hagerstown High School in the 1940’s where he and a friend established a “Breakfast Club”: Students came for a bite to eat and student-tutoring before school began. He graduated with Honors from Hagerstown High in 1948 worked briefly in Statistics at Potomac Edison Power Co. then went on to UVA in Charlottesville VA graduating in 1954 with a BA in Mathematics and a strong interest in a certain young nurse. Bob and that nurse Dorothy Blackwell R.N. married in December 1955 (Doylesville VA); they had four children; four grandchildren. He also served in the U.S. Navy (1955-1958) during the Korean War as an Air Intelligence & Radar Analysis Officer on staff of Commander-in-Chief Atlantic Fleet based in Virginia and later as a Lieutenant Naval Reserves till 1970. Bob’s career with IBM began in 1960 and spanned 30 years.

In 1960 IBM hired him as a computer programmer in Washington D.C. and in 1961 Bob and IBM colleague Marilyn B. Scott co-authored a technical paper entitled The Role of Digital Computers in Project Mercury; the Mercury Programming System published in the AFIPS ’61 (Eastern) Proceedings of the December 12-14 1961 eastern joint computer conference. In 1962 IBM transferred Bob as a contract computer programmer to NASA’s Manned Space Flight Center in Houston TX where he helped design and develop the “Mercury Monitor Real-Time Control System” for space flights. Bob cited this period as a highlight of his 30-year career with IBM in the US and in France noting: “The Mercury Monitor Control System provided the data to accurately track space flights from launch through orbit and splashdown for successful astronaut recovery and to identify potential threats during flight missions.”

After decades in management with IBM including 4 years for IBM-Europe HQ in Paris France at La Défense and years in MD NY and CT Bob retired to Charlottesville in 1990 where he volunteered with the Optimist Club and continued studies of interest from theoretical physics to philosophy. Often seen with book in hand Bob’s passion for education inspired curiosity and a love of learning. He had a quiet sense of humor and savored a good laugh (along with a good meal!). Bob and Dot enjoyed diverse UVA recreational and educational events; more travel; family/grandchildren visits; picnics; ice cream (always!); and fine dining. One of Bob’s favorite American restaurants was Charlottesville’s Vivace whose Chef Landon Saul is one of Dot’s first cousins once removed. Bob also enjoyed opera music played at high volume felt as well as heard throughout their home (not as enjoyed by Dot!). A few years after Dot’s passage in 2010 Bob relocated to Lake Placid FL and Hilton Head SC. He continued to read study enjoy fine dining travel and stay physically fit even hiking at Machu Picchu in Peru at age 86 with late-in-life special friend Anita Martinec.

Survivors include one son Brent B. Hoffman and wife Cathie (Keaner) of Charlotte NC; three daughters Karen H. Atwood and husband Chris of Mechanicsburg PA; Lisa C. Hoffman of Durham NC; Ingrid L. Tepelmann and husband Fritz of Camden ME; four grandchildren: Brent Hoffman; Kaitlin Hoffman; Julia (Atwood) Robinson and husband Joe; Benjamin Tepelmann; and also one brother E. Eugene Hoffman and wife Betty (Cohill) of Talking Rocks GA and their families; sister-in-law M. Louise (Blackwell) Rich of Crozet VA and families; the families of sister-in-law Mary (Blackwell) Sheridan (2010; Crozet); and special friend Anita Martinec.

The deal adds a team of 20 professionals – qualified accountants and technology specialists – to Chartertech which now sees its headcount break through the 100-barrier within five years of its inception.

Founded in 2017 by Michael McRoberts and George Skillin (and a co-founding team) Chartertech similarly focuses on the niche that brings together finance and accounting expertise with deep technical systems and process knowledge.

Chartertech builds its services on two technology stacks: IBM (focused on Planning Analytics [also known as IBM TM1] and IBM Cognos Business Intelligence) and TechnologyOne (Australia’s largest enterprise Software as a Service provider).

“The acquisition of Infocube expands Chartertech’s TM1 capability” said Skillin. Alongside consulting and implementation offerings Infocube also has an IBM Planning Analytics education platform ExploringTM1 and an online community and fee-based training and membership platform TM1 Explorers.

In addition the bolt-on boosts the New South Wales (NSW) operation of the Canberra-based group. “We’ll be growing our Sydney team so Chartertech has a larger presence in NSW that can service clients across state government and the private sector” said McRoberts.

“This is an exciting highlight in Chartertech’s growth journey” remarked McRoberts and Skillin.

Meanwhile for Infocube the joining of forces will enable the firm to work “with Chartertech on larger finance consulting projects” said company founder John Vaughan. “We’re looking forward to working with other planning analytics specialists to innovate and extend our TM1 service offering and work with complementary Chartertech products and service lines.”

Clients the two accounting-heritage consultancies work for include the Department of Defence Australian Signals Directorate Department of Home Affairs Department of Veterans’ Affairs National Audit Office and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency.

In 2021 Chartertech closed two deals: Cubicus an IBM Planning Analytics consultancy; and Screen Consulting a TechnologyOne specialist firm. The group currently has just over 100 employees on its payroll.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnN1bHRhbmN5LmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzLzU0MDgveW9sYW5kYS1zdGVhZC1uZXctYW56LWhlYWQtb2YtYWxsaWFuY2VzLWF0LWl0LWdpYW50LWt5bmRyeWzSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb25zdWx0YW5jeS5jb20uYXUvbmV3cy9hbXAvNTQwOC95b2xhbmRhLXN0ZWFkLW5ldy1hbnotaGVhZC1vZi1hbGxpYW5jZXMtYXQtaXQtZ2lhbnQta3luZHJ5bA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Yolanda Stead new ANZ head of alliances at IT giant Kyndryl,"Profile Kyndryl

After three years with KPMG Yolanda Stead has departed the Big Four firm to become Head of Alliances for Australia and New Zealand at Kyndryl.

At KPMG Yolanda Stead held a similar role – National Alliances Director for Australia – since joining the accounting and consulting firm in April 2019. In the position she oversaw KPMG’s partnerships with technology vendors including SAP Oracle and Microsoft as well as smaller vendors.

“Yolanda brings vast partnership experience to Kyndryl and our continually-growing ecosystem” said Kerry Purcell President of Kyndryl in Australia and New Zealand.

Kyndryl launched last year following the spin-off of IBM’s US$19 billion managed services business. In its first full quarter as an independent company Kyndryl reported worldwide revenues of US$4.4 billion. Australia and New Zealand is part of the firm’s ‘Principal Markets’ division which also houses its mature operations in Canada France Germany and the United Kingdom among others.

Expanding its ecosystem of technology partnership is a key pillar of Kyndryl’s growth plan as the company aims to become the largest vendor-independent IT infrastructure services provider in the world.

In her new role Stead will work closely with existing partners as well as identify new alliance opportunities to create solutions that “benefit local customers and the wider channel ecosystem” said Purcell.

Stead steps into the role vacated by Vanessa Simpson in February this year. Simpson who previously spent more than 26 years with IBM took on Kyndryl's alliance leadership after it was divested from Big Blue last year.

Earlier in her career Stead worked across strategic accounts at Oracle and as a technical account manager at Aconex. She began her career in South Africa working with LexisNexis Aconex and Arup before moving to Australia in 2017."

""It (Intel Corporation's $20 billion computer chip manufacturing operation) will be 14 miles from the school building but only three miles from Alexandria"" said superintendent Scott Schmidt whose district encompasses 137 square miles. ""That's the size of the area covered by Columbus City Schools and ranks in the top 10-15 in the state"" he said.

The district has a relatively small population spread over a large area. That doesn't mean Northridge is waiting around to see what happens. It is monitoring growth through sewer and water infrastructure zoning changes and building permits.

""It's an opportunity but public utilities are expensive."" Schmidt said. ""The county commissioners are doing a water and sewer infrastructure study a feasibility study and it will take 10 months. We have to be aware and know the possibilities. Sewer and water infrastructure are critical to growth and expansion.""

It was pointed out that even with the Honda plant Marysville did not see instantaneous growth due to lack of water and sewer. A lot of the Central Ohio growth has occurred in Delaware County because they had more water and sewer capabilities.

Future Intel jobs

Intel will be located in Jersey Township in western Licking County on over 3000 acres just south of Johnstown to be annexed into New Albany. They plan to start construction later this year with production scheduled to begin in 2025. It expects to hire 3000 employees and the project is expected to create 7000 construction jobs and 10000 indirect jobs. It is possible this stage is just the first part of a $100 billion investment by the company.

""How do we best position Northridge students to get those jobs?"" said assistant superintendent Dr. Kristine Michael. ""We have to look at our curriculum create STEM opportunities and work with C-TEC. We already have a great middle school technology pathway. It's a learn how-to program and they're partnered with Amazon Future Engineers and STEM.""

Northridge has some good things going for it. The district just spent its first year in a new pre-k through fifth grade elementary school. Money is still being raised for a new stadium complex that will feature a turf field track bleachers and multi-purpose building.

The middle school (the former high school) is 47 years old but upgraded water and sewer lines. The high school was built in 1996. ""We have room for some growth"" Schmidt said. ""We could welcome 200 new students right now in K-12.""

The district's most recent live births to kindergarten ratio does not project significant growth over the next 10 years. ""But that was before Intel"" Schmidt said. ""We've had initial discussions about hiring a consultant and we anticipate bringing one on board for growth projections and strategic planning.""

Schools team up

One good thing to grow out of the COVID pandemic was cooperation and planning between Licking County superintendents Michael said. It will be much needed again with the Intel project. Northridge borders upon several districts including New Albany Johnstown Southwest Licking Licking Heights Granville North Fork Centerburg Mount Vernon and Big Walnut.

""Intel has talked about aiding the schools and if there are charitable dollars available we don't want to have to compete for them. Our county is not that big and we need to work together"" Michael said.

""It's a great opportunity for the region"" Schmidt said. ""The superintendents of Licking County need to collaborate and partner as a group.""

Schmidt and Michael were able to attend a meeting where the superintendent of Chandler Arizona schools related his experiences with Intel. ""Educational Service Centers do a great job of connecting superintendents through Grow Licking County and Columbus First"" Michael said.

Reliable information

Intel will locate its factories in an area bordered by Green Chapel Road to the north Mink Street to the east Clover Valley Road to the west and approximately midway between Miller Road and Jug Street to the south. New Albany plans to annex a large part of Jersey Township eventually having almost all the land bordered by Clover Valley Mink Jug and the Franklin County line.

Northridge is closely watching developments on a possible merger between Alexandria and St. Albans Township which expects to see pressure for development. Although at a recent meeting local experts explained to a standing-room crowd that zoning overlay districts and joint economic development districts could prevent annexation without the merger.

The school district traverses seven Licking County townships along with ones in Knox and Delaware counties. Thus far county residents and townships have expressed concerns about roadways funding property taxes expanding schools and having to build new fire stations.

Schmidt and Michael have some advice: use reliable sources when researching information.

""We have a lot of parents getting information from an Intel group on Facebook"" Schmidt said. ""It's speculation versus possibility versus actuality which are three different things."" They recommend the New Albany: Silicon Heartland website and the Intel in Ohio website. Also contact former local state representative Scott Ryan who works for the Ohio Department of Development as a governor's liaison for the Intel project.

""We need to be very aware and diligent"" Schmidt said of Intel. ""It's not going to happen overnight but we need to be prepared.""

In an interview this week with The Register RISC-V International CEO Calista Redmond reckons the buy-in which comes in the form of paid memberships is needed to support ongoing development of the royalty-free CPU instruction set architecture to better compete with x86 and Arm ISAs.

""We have to have a level of funding in order to operate and manage this special rodeo of ours"" she says.

Redmond an IBM veteran pitches involvement in RISC-V International which gives paying members an extra level of say in the ISA's future development as a more even playing field for tech companies than what has been allowed with proprietary ISAs namely x86 and Arm.

""What everybody gets from this is the vested collective interests of everyone involved to say 'My destiny isn't pinned to any one or five companies. Everyone's investing together therefore my level of risk is much lower'"" she says.

When Intel joined RISC-V International in February it became a premium member the top membership tier that gave the semiconductor giant a seat on the nonprofit's board and the Technical Steering Committee which determines new features and specifications for the ISA.

For those privileges Intel and the other 19 premium members each chip in an annual fee of $250000 according to the nonprofit's website.

Redmond characterizes the interest of these premier members like this:

I want to really underwrite this thing because it helps me with my own commercialization as well as builds the ecosystem that fosters continued momentum across the industry where I will find development partners customers new opportunities growing all of that stuff that makes something really strategically durable.

Besides Intel other major companies with premier memberships include Alibaba Cloud Google Huawei Unisoc Western Digital and ZTE.

The premier members also range from startups like StarFive Ventana and Micro Systems to SiFive the latter of which is hoping to go public in the next two years with a RISC-V CPU licensing business.

There are many more RISC-V International members at the ""strategic"" level which still gives them the ability to weigh in on the future development on the ISA but not at the same level as premier members.

These members which include Canonical Nvidia and Samsung pay as much as $35000 for an annual membership. Smaller organizations pay half or less.

But it's not just companies that are members. RISC-V's more than 2400 members also include universities and government-related entities.

Just last week India's government announced that it had become a premier member and revealed a RISC-V roadmap for homegrown processors.

Another significant government-related entity with premium membership is the Chinese Academy of Sciences which participates through its Institute of Software and Institute of Computing Technology. The academy is on the US Entity List of trade-restricted organizations which underlines the unique position RISC-V is in with its open-source nature amid international tensions.

But Redmond says that as with other countries such as Russia RISC-V International is ""not required to block anybody from engaging and participating"" though the organization will make changes if needed.

""If things go the way of sanctions that are heavier on a country level we may need to pivot but at this point we are abiding by things and [are] in very close contact in understanding what are other open source and global organizations doing"" she says.

CEO has nuanced view of what RISC-V's rise will look like

For member companies that have historically been associated with proprietary ISAs such as x86 or Arm Redmond tells us they are looking at RISC-V to diversify their risk. It also gives these companies another ISA to support their increasing heterogenous computing needs.

""It makes business sense to do it"" she says.

In the case of Intel Redmond thinks the x86 giant's involvement with RISC-V is helping support the company's revitalized contract manufacturing business which has vowed to make custom chips for others using x86 Arm or RISC-V ISAs as part of a larger comeback plan.

While Intel's move to support RISC-V could seen as a conflict with the semiconductor giant's traditional x86 business Redmond admits that she doesn't think RISC-V poses an existential threat.

""This isn't inside information but I'm pretty sure they're not too worried about their x86 business. I mean they've locked that in. They've got so many customers that have some millions into that already. People are not typically ripping out existing investments"" she says.

However Redmond does see an opportunity for RISC-V to win business in new and emerging workloads and she thinks over time devices and IT infrastructure will increasingly shift to the open-source ISA.

""Now one or two generations down the line as you continue to advance and evolve your portfolio I expect many of those may shift to RISC-V"" she says.

But Redmond has a more nuanced view of what a world filled with more RISC-V designs will look like. She doesn't necessarily believe x86 and Arm will fall out of fashion. Instead she suspects tech companies will increasingly see RISC-V x86 and Arm ISAs as tools within the same toolbox. This will lead to a greater mix of ISAs used in devices and IT infrastructure which is already starting to play out.

For instance Intel uses Arm core designs for some products including its Mount Evans infrastructure processing unit. AMD relies on Arm for hardware-based security within its processors and its reportedly looking at incorporating RISC-V into future products. While Nvidia is expanding its use of Arm with upcoming server CPUs it also uses RISC-V within its GPUs as does Imagination which backs the architecture.

""You start to look at technology and hardware differently as building blocks rather than a blind allegiance"" says the CEO.

RISC-V can move faster than Arm

It's important to note that RISC-V for the most part is pretty far out from powering mainstream processors in servers and PCs.

Patrick Little CEO of RISC-V designer SiFive told us in March he doesn't expect to see commercial processors using the company's designs in PCs until late 2025 and server efforts will take longer than that.

It should be noted too that Arm has only just started to become a serious contender in PCs and servers over the past couple years.

But Redmond says that Google and other so-called hyperscalers are working on RISC-V projects ""under the covers"" and pointed out that the ISA is also used in microcontrollers in storage devices from companies like Western Digital and Seagate.

She also highlights Alibaba Cloud's XuanTie RISC-V processors which have been marketed for networking devices gateways and edge servers [PDF].

Intel joins RISC-V governing body pledges $1bn fund for chip designers READ MORE

Another company Esperanto Technologies is testing its 1000-core RISC-V AI chip with Samsung's IT services arm and other companies Redmond noted. We also know of another startup Ventana Micro Systems that is building RISC-V server chips.

Redmond didn't cite any examples of PC activities. We do know that SiFive launched a RISC-V development board for desktops in late 2020 for instance while Microchip offers RISC-V boards folks are recreating the TRS-80 Model 100 with a RISC-V system-on-chip... it's safe to say various projects and products are on the go.

She promises we will see more examples of RISC-V implementations of both servers and PCs later this year.

""You're going to see a laptop this year. You're going to see more datacenter implementation stories this year"" she says.

The CEO also makes a bolder promise: whereas it took Arm about 20 years to get where it is today she predicts it will take RISC-V roughly five years to make the same amount of progress. ""Where are we in the adoption curve? We're not halfway yet but we are getting there very quickly"" she says.

The caveat she adds is that the five-year timeline is an ""imprecise measurement"" as RISC-V International and its members need to fill out some additional capabilities on the instruction set side as well as software support to cover a broad spectrum of applications.

But what makes Redmond confident in RISC-V's ability to gain more traction over the next few years is the growing support the ISA has received from a plurality of organizations.

""The reason that we're getting there faster is that we have a greater shared pool of investment across the community that is driving that"" she says. ®",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2ludGVsLWFyYy1hbGNoZW1pc3QtZ2FtaW5nLWdyYXBoaWNzLWNhcmRzLWRlbGF5LWxhdGUtc3VtbWVyLWRyaXZlcnMtcHJvYmxlbWF0aWMv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vaW50ZWwtYXJjLWFsY2hlbWlzdC1nYW1pbmctZ3JhcGhpY3MtY2FyZHMtZGVsYXktbGF0ZS1zdW1tZXItZHJpdmVycy1wcm9ibGVtYXRpYy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Arc Alchemist Gaming Graphics Cards Availability Reportedly Delayed Till Mid-Summer Drivers Still Problematic,"Intel's much anticipated Arc Alchemist gaming graphics cards may very well be delayed into mid-Summer based on the latest information from Igor's Lab. The graphics cards are scheduled for a launch by the end of Q2 but based on various problems related to the drivers the launch is likely delayed.

Intel's First Arc Alchemist Gaming Graphics Cards Reportedly Delayed Till Mid Summer 2022 Drivers Cited As The Cause of Delay Once Again

A few days ago we reported the expected release timeframe of Intel's Arc Alchemist graphics cards for the gaming segment. Based on the Alchemist Xe-HPG architecture the first Arc A-Series cards were expected to hit store shelves by the end of this quarter. In fact Intel already announced the top Arc Limited Edition graphics card for launch by the end of Q2 2022. Intel has also announced the winners of its Scavenger Hunt to be the first to get their hands on the new graphics cards even before they hit store shelves.

But as of right now reports regarding the proper launch are looking grim. Igor Wallossek reports that based on various sources Intel might postpone the actual availability of its gaming graphics card lineup till late Summer. This sets a time period of July 1st till August 31st. Igor also reports that AIBs are becoming quite frustrated with Intel's planning and don't know when the graphics cards are going to actually launch.

The reason once again is cited to be the drivers. You might remember our previous report that also cited how drivers are the main cause of the delay and Intel wants to sort out all the issues prior to releasing their cards. That's one reason why Intel has done a limited launch of its first Arc A-series products in the Asian markets. The Arc A350M and Arc A370M GPUs for laptops are as of right now only available in select Asian regions and in select laptops. The US EU and other major regions are yet to get access to Arc-powered laptops. With the entry-level lineup being shipped in such limited volume one can imagine just how low-volume the high-end Arc 5 and Arc 7 series will get.

As for how this delay affects the whole lineup the final specifications have already been set in stone so clocks and firmware are unlikely to change. But currently the drivers are questionable at best. No one actually possesses the final drivers and the ones that they have in their hands are either to camouflage the actual performance or just avoid negative reports through the online press media.

NVIDIA and AMD are already convinced based on their findings that their current offerings are competitive enough to tackle whatever Intel brings to the table in the form of Arc Alchemist gaming graphics cards. NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3070 Ti 16 GB's cancellation and AMD not pushing the RX 6750 XT way higher than the RTX 3070 is evidence that both GPU giants are very confident with their existing lineups. A mid to late Summer availability would also mean that the Intel lineup is going to end up super close to NVIDIA and AMD's next-gen graphics card launch which are also expected around Q4 2022.

Furthermore all of these delays and driver issues don't bode well for Intel's first graphics launch. Plus if this continues then Intel could lose potential board partners which would affect the roll-out of their Arc graphics cards further. Overall this isn't looking good at all but hopefully Intel can put forward a better launch timeframe at its upcoming 'VISION' event followed by more detailed specs and pricing disclosures at Computex 2022 at the end of this month.

Intel VCA2 is a sophisticated enterprise device build for cloud computing. Users can install Windows or Linux instances and connect directly to the device remotely. It is therefore a device to lower the cost for businesses that allow multiple users to use the card’s resources either for work or remote gaming.

The VCA2 is not a new product it was released in 2016 and has already been discontinued. The VCA accelerators were build for QuickSync video acceleration through integrated Iris Pro P580 graphics.

Intel Visual Compute Accelerator 2 Source: der8auer

The device itself supports up to 44 streams at 1080p resolution and using H264 codec or up to 14 simultaneously stream at 4K. To achieve this the board is equipped with three quad-core Xeon E-1585L v5 processors rated at 45W TDP based on Skylake architecture. Each processor is attached to its own SO-DIMM memory bank (up to 64GB DDR4 per card). This is then connected the PLX chipsets to share a single PCIe 3.0 x16 interface.

Der8auer has made some progress in making the device show up in the system but is yet to find the full software solution to utilize the device the way it was intended. Should any of our readers know how to run this device make sure to let Roman know.

ICE,Intercontinental Exchange,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA1LzA4L3doeS1pbnRlcmNvbnRpbmVudGFsLWV4Y2hhbmdlLXRvb2stYS1iaWctaGl0LWFmdGVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Intercontinental Exchange Took a Big Hit After Q1 Results,"The New York Stock Exchange's owner is opening its wallet for a new acquisition.

All in all Intercontinental Exchange (ICE 1.86%) had a decent first quarter the details of which were unveiled by the company on Thursday. Investors promptly traded the stock down but I feel this has less to do with the securities exchange operator's quarterly fundamentals and more to do with an acquisition it announced the day before those figures were published.

A NYSE quarterly performance

Impressively for such a well-established business -- Intercontinental Exchange owns the hallowed New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) among other similar assets -- the company always finds a way to grow its business. In the first quarter it managed to lift net revenue by 6% year over year to $1.9 billion. That was ever-so-slightly above the average analyst estimate of $1.89 billion for the period.

On the bottom line the consistently profitable company yet again landed in the black. Matching revenue growth adjusted net income advanced at a 6% pace to $804 million. Note that this shakes out to a net margin of 42%. As it's a provider of services and its costs are relatively low margins tend to be high -- although they usually end up lower in the 20%- and 30%-plus range.

Intercontinental Exchange a frequent payer and once-per-year raiser of quarterly dividends also declared its latest such payout. On June 30 the company will dispense $0.38 per share to investors of record as of June 15. At the most recent closing stock price that yields 1.5%.

Jousting with a big asset buy

The company's finances are going to take a hit no matter what though because of the aforementioned acquisition. What's being acquired is Black Knight (BKI) a somewhat under-the-radar fintech that offers real estate financing and analytics services.

Publicly traded companies don't come cheap these days and so it is with Black Knight. Intercontinental Exchange's deal for the fintech is valued at over $13 billion most of which ($10.5 billion) is to be paid in cash with the remainder being settled in the acquirer's stock.

Intercontinental Exchange is financing the cash portion of the purchase with a blend of freshly issued debt and cash on hand. As of March 31 it had $638 million in cash and equivalents on its books and $12.4 billion in long-term borrowings. So that incoming debt load is going to have quite the effect on the balance sheet -- no wonder investors are cooling on the stock.

Yet the company seems to be able to source debt financing relatively cheaply. Its quarterly interest expense is running a bit north of $100 million these days.

Even if that level more or less doubles Intercontinental Exchange's free cash flow is robust -- over the past four quarters it's averaged nearly $728 million. The company then should continue to have enough dosh for interest payments debt retirement and dividend payments.

Meanwhile it's acquiring an asset that as it says ""complements and strengthens ICE's rapidly growing mortgage technology business.""

In other words an already powerful company is bulking up in an area where it's still a fairly new player. Given how well Intercontinental Exchange has managed its core business I'd have every confidence it can scale up its real estate financing operations quickly and successfully. It's likely the hefty Black Knight price tag will continue to ding the stock price but to me that presents a tempting buy opportunity for investors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vY2FyYm9uY3JlZGl0cy5jb20vaWNlLWxhdW5jaGVzLW5hdHVyZS1iYXNlZC1zb2x1dGlvbnMtZnV0dXJlcy1jb250cmFjdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ICE Launches New Nature-Based Solutions Futures Contract Rivals CME,"Intercontinental Exchange Inc. or ICE has launched new nature-based solutions carbon credit futures contract.

ICE is a Fortune 500 company that offers financial technology data and market infrastructure services. It operates exchanges like the NYSE and clearing houses to help people invest raise capital and manage risk across asset classes.

ICE created its first nature-based futures contract called NBS future. It trades under the contract code NBT which delivers verified carbon unit (VCU) credits.

ICE NBT futures have several certifications. These include Verra VCS Agriculture and Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) Projects. It also has certifications from the Climate Community and Biodiversity (CCB) Standard.

ICE Nature-Based Solutions Futures Contract

An entity can produce NBS carbon credits through various schemes like planting trees or protecting forests.

Each ICE NBS futures contract equals 1000 carbon credits. And each credit equals one metric ton of emissions removed or reduced by projects that preserve natural ecosystems.

It has vintages covering January 1 2016 to December 31 2020.

ICE has listed NBS futures expiries in December 2022 December 2023 and December 2024.

They traded at $11.25 per tonne by 1109 GMT according to data from the ICE website.

As per Gordon Bennett Managing Director of Utility Markets at ICE

“The NBS future is our first contract specifically designed to measure the carbon sequestration and storage capabilities of nature… we hope it to be an important valuation tool to conserve and grow the world’s natural capital base.”

The decision to launch this contract will help bring price signals to the carbon market. The firm also believes that it will incentivize efficient capital allocation to balance the world’s carbon budget and hit net zero goals.

ICE has worked with environmental markets for about 20 years now. Over this period it has traded over 100 billion tons of carbon allowances and over 250 million renewable energy certificates.

Moreover ICE traded about 3 billion carbon credits which is equal to over 1.4 billion Renewable Identification Numbers.

In 2021 alone ICE traded around $1 trillion in the notional value of carbon allowances. This is equal to more than half the estimated global annual energy-related emissions.

ICE Futures Contract Supporters

A lot of large companies are supporting the futures contract. These are Shell Chevron Vitol Trafigura EDF Trading Elbow River Marketing Ltd. (a fully owned Parkland Fuel subsidiary) the Macquarie Group and Vertree Partners.

For instance according to Bill McGrath from Shell

“The launch of ICE NBS futures is a crucial milestone to scale the voluntary carbon market… In particular it will help boost the flow of capital for developing nature-based projects.”

Last year Shell partnered with PetroChina to supply it with carbon-neutral LNG cargos. Their goal is to offset CO2 emissions generated across the LNG value chain with carbon credits from nature-based projects.

For Vitol quality assurance and transparency of carbon credits are also vital. Michael Curran from Vitol said that the launch will grow investment in verified carbon mitigating projects. Plus it will raise standards and price transparency across the carbon credit industry.

Whereas Hannah Hauman from Trafigura finds the launch of ICE nature-based solutions futures a crucial development in global carbon markets. And that it will help deliver transparency and liquidity for quality nature-based solutions.

Likewise Elbow River Marketing thinks that it will also bring liquidity to the booming voluntary carbon market.

In August last year CME Group launched its CBL Nature-based Global Emissions Offset (N-GEO) futures contract. It’s also one of the top nature-based solutions (NBS) contracts available in the market.

CME’s CBL N-GEO contracts consist of offsets from agriculture forestry and other land-use projects. They’re verified to have additional climate community and biodiversity accreditation.

CBL N-GEO futures contract has the same rigorous certifications as ICE NBS futures. They are also both created to help create a more transparent and efficient voluntary carbon market.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzU3ZDZjNzI1LTVkNzQtNGFiYi04MjMzLWYyYTAzMmQxNGRhYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ETF investing plummets to lowest level since Covid crisis hit,"Print this page

Purchases of exchange traded funds fell in April to their lowest level since the depths of the Covid crisis as the war in Ukraine and spiralling global inflation sapped demand.

Net inflows to ETFs and exchange traded products globally slipped to $27.4bn in April according to data from BlackRock down from $117.4bn in March and the lowest figure since March 2020.

Equity funds were particularly badly hit with inflows slowing to a trickle of just $2.8bn compared to $76.2bn a month earlier.

The near-standstill coincided with turbulence in equity markets with the FTSE All-World index slumping 8.1 per cent in April taking its year-to-date losses to 13.2 per cent amid the growing threat of stagflation.

“We have seen a significant drop-off in headline equity flows” said Karim Chedid head of investment strategy for BlackRock’s iShares ETF arm in the Emea region.

Nevertheless he said although there was an element of de-risking “I wouldn’t say it’s a dash for cash by any stretch of the imagination”.

The souring mood was most noticeable in the US with a net $25.6bn withdrawn from equity ETFs focused on Wall Street while there were far smaller outflows from European equities and net flows into broad developed market vehicles emerging markets and Japan.

Morningstar data showed that three large core US equity ETFs: iShares Core S&P 500 (IVV) SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) and Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO) each bled between $10bn and $12bn in April — a far cry from March when all three had been in the top five nationally for inflows.

The $10.2bn pulled from VOO was the largest monthly outflow from any Vanguard ETF on record according to Morningstar.

Moreover the outflows from these three funds meant iShares Vanguard and State Street the three industry leaders each saw outflows from their global ETF complexes in aggregate in April its data showed.

Chedid argued these outflows were largely driven by a technical factor: futures contracts currently trade at a discount to broad market indices “so some institutional clients have switched in the past month from US equity ETFs to futures” he said.

“Flows of this size are typically tied to the derivatives markets” Chedid added. “It’s important to keep in mind however that these outflows don’t represent investor selling or a shift in sentiment — just a shift in the way they get exposure to the underlying index.”

At the sector level there were clear signs of investors adopting a more defensive stance. Healthcare ETFs attracted a net $3.6bn BlackRock said while the $2bn piped into utilities funds was the most since February 2016 and the third-highest figure on record.

A further $6.3bn was pulled out of financials ETFs meaning the sector is now in the red year-to-date — despite chalking up an all-time monthly record inflow of $10.9bn in January.

The $11.7bn scooped up by emerging market equity ETFs up from $6.6bn in March may seem to run counter to this mood of risk aversion. However BlackRock said it was largely driven by demand for Asia-listed China funds suggesting some local investors may see signs of value starting to appear in beaten-up Chinese stocks.

Wariness was also the order of the day in fixed income even if overall inflows only dipped to $18.8bn from $25.5bn in March.

Government bonds ETFs drew in $15.9bn a figure exceeded once before in November 2018. In contrast flows to higher risk investment grade corporate bonds fell from $3.3bn in March to $1.2bn and turned negative in the eurozone.

Further still up the risk curve high-yield bond funds bled $3.5bn hit by net withdrawals in both the US and Europe.

Circumspection was also the order of the day in terms of duration with short-term maturity funds attracting $7.5bn far more than the $1.8bn soaked up by long-term ones.

Nevertheless Chedid said there were signs of some animal spirits starting to return in the most recent data with investment grade yields of just under 4 per cent looking attractive to some a trend he thought “had legs” and duration positioning “coming back from extreme levels”.

Ryan Jackson manager research analyst at Morningstar also pointed to some signs of risk appetite in the US ETF market with leveraged equity funds attracting a net $5.2bn in April.

Within this the Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3x ETF (SOXL) and ProShares UltraPro (TQQQ) both of which offer triple exposure to technology-focused indices sucked in $2.3bn and $1.9bn respectively.

“Investors in these ETFs seem to be channelling the proverbial ‘buy the dip’ mentality trying to capitalise on these benchmarks’ recent woes” Jackson said.

However with losses mounting — SOXL has fallen 37 per cent since the start of April and TQQQ 38.4 per cent — Jackson said investors had been “early to the party” and only “time will tell” if they continue to double-down on such punchy bets.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzQwZTUxNjIwLTNkYTYtNGJjNi05ZDQzLTA1MjM2YzdkYWE5M9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cloud computing powers the world's financial exchanges,"Print this page

Simply sign up to the Technology sector myFT Digest -- delivered directly to your inbox.

Many of the world’s largest financial exchanges are transforming the way they run global capital markets through the adoption of cloud computing technologies.

In November financial derivatives exchange CME Group entered a 10-year partnership with Google that will move CME’s IT infrastructure and markets to the cloud. CME says this will enable it to launch new products and services much more quickly.

A few weeks later Nasdaq and Amazon Web Services announced a similar collaboration. Through a several-year partnership AWS will work with Nasdaq to transfer the latter’s North America-based markets to a cloud computing environment.

Traditional institutions such as financial exchanges are drawn to cloud infrastructure because they want to “increase market access” and “streamline operations” according to Adrian Poole head of financial services at Google Cloud UK.

He explains that they can achieve these goals due to the flexible and scalable nature of cloud technology which enables organisations to scale capacity up or down at any time.

But Poole adds that cloud adoption isn’t just a case of improving infrastructure. He points out that multinational companies like CME Group are using the greater processing power of cloud computing to “meet customer expectations in new ways” and “drive transformation”.

“The vast amount of computing power that the cloud offers means that data analysis can happen at lightning speed” he explains. “This means that when it comes to firms wanting to do things like risk management it can be done in real time — adjusting by the minute to factors such as legal liability and financial uncertainty.

“Organisations can use these capabilities to their advantage — for example using this data analysis to create automated tools that can help mitigate risk.”

Cloud computing also provides a range of security and privacy benefits for financial institutions that hold vast amounts of sensitive data — and have become prime targets for cybercriminals.

Poole says cloud providers are able to meet the need for continuous risk monitoring and regulatory compliance by adopting practices such zero-trust models. These ensure that all user identities — in or out of a network — are verified.

In addition customer data are protected by the engineering principle of ‘redundant design’ where critical system components are duplicated to provide back-up and increased reliability.

Spectrum Markets a pan-European trading venue for securitised derivatives uses cloud computing for storing and analysing data. The company’s chief executive Nicky Maan says the most significant benefit of cloud systems is how they allow digital infrastructure to be used for accelerating business growth.

“It is really easy to extend the cloud resources you use as and when required because the storage and processing of data are not dependent on traditional in-house hardware capabilities. You can simply rent the additional capacity you need.

“This can even run automatically where your system detects it needs more capacity and immediately acquires additional resources” Maan notes. “So if the number of financial products listed on your venue grows from say 2500 to 100000 you don’t need to install new systems to store all the data or scale up your analysis capacity to handle the additional volume of information.”

Financial institutions outsourcing their technical infrastructure to a cloud provider like Amazon Google or Microsoft however must ensure systems comply with industry regulations such as those set by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority and the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

“That includes having full control on latency — or the speed of information transmission required for accurately pricing financial products — as well as the ability to transfer any outsourced part of your infrastructure to another provider in the event something goes wrong” Maan explains.

“Saying ‘my supplier went down’ isn’t a valid excuse to the regulator” he emphasises. “So you need to be able to switch your supplier to another one if they continually let you down.”

But because switching between two cloud platforms is an arduous task he recommends that financial exchanges keep “complex integrated and time-sensitive systems” on hardware-based infrastructure instead.

An example of such a system is the matching engine of a digital exchange — “the heart of any marketplace as it determines the prices at which buyers and sellers transact”.

A single cloud provider may not be enough to manage all risks though suggests Conor Colleary group vice-president of financial services at US computing giant Oracle.

He warns: “With service availability and security being the main priorities stock exchanges need to be aware that the stakes of a service interruption at a single cloud service provider are higher as organisations need to make sure they are using the best cloud for each particular function or workload.” This is to avoid “putting all your eggs in one basket”.

Colleary says firms can avoid system outages cyber security breaches and internet traffic problems by adopting a multi-cloud approach — whereby they use a variety of cloud services from several providers instead of just one. This means stock exchanges can “play to the different strengths of different clouds” and “have a Plan B if their cloud service goes down”.

“Resilience and trust are crucial as capital markets companies rely on their customers being confident in their ability to stay online 24/7 in order to deliver data to customers as fast as technically possible” Colleary adds.

Furthermore cloud technology enables a move away from outdated networking equipment and servers which are often expensive and time-consuming to maintain.

Chris Weston principal of client advisory at analyst firm IDC believes emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing will transform cloud capabilities in the foreseeable future.

For example he envisages that businesses making lots of transactions and storing large volumes of data will be able to use quantum computing platforms to perform “calculations that until now have been impossible or way too lengthy with traditional computers”.

Meanwhile powerful AI tools will let securities exchanges perform “real-time analysis of trading to highlight and mitigate compliance and conduct issues as they arise”.

Weston says he has no doubt that AI and quantum computing “will form part of the technology road maps of these organisations over the next five to 10 years”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vc2F1ZGlnYXpldHRlLmNvbS5zYS9hcnRpY2xlLzYyMDIxONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aramco shares hit highest price at SR46.10 since listing in Saudi market,"Saudi Gazette report

Strategic divestitures and cost management reflect a proactive approach to market challenges.

Legal and regulatory hurdles pose potential risks to IFF's operational stability.

Investment in R&D and productivity gains signal a commitment to innovation and efficiency.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (NYSE:IFF) a global leader in specialty ingredients production has recently disclosed its financial performance for the first quarter of 2024. Despite a slight decrease in net sales from $3.027 billion to $2.899 billion the company has shown an impressive increase in gross profit from $964 million to $1.024 billion indicating effective cost management and operational efficiency. As we delve into a SWOT analysis of IFF we'll explore the company's internal dynamics and external market conditions that could influence its strategic decisions and future growth.

Beyond the Balance Sheet: What SWOT Reveals About International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF)

Strengths

Robust Gross Profit Margin Improvement: IFF's ability to increase its gross profit margin from 31.8% to 35.3% amidst a sales decline is a testament to its strong operational management. This improvement suggests that IFF has effectively controlled its cost of goods sold which decreased significantly by $188 million and has optimized its manufacturing processes to enhance profitability.

Strategic Divestitures and Portfolio Optimization: The company's strategic decision to divest certain business units such as the Savory Solutions and Flavor Specialty Ingredients (FSI) businesses reflects a focused approach to streamline operations and concentrate on core growth areas. These divestitures while impacting sales have allowed IFF to reallocate resources and reduce associated costs positioning it for more targeted growth.

Investment in Research and Development: IFF's commitment to innovation is evident in its increased R&D expenses which rose to $166 million. This investment is crucial for the company to maintain its competitive edge by developing new and improved products thereby ensuring long-term sustainability in a rapidly evolving industry.

Weaknesses

Dependence on Global Economic Conditions: IFF's performance is closely tied to global economic trends as seen in the impact of unfavorable exchange rates on its sales. The company's reliance on international markets exposes it to currency fluctuations and economic volatility which can affect its financial results.

Increased Selling and Administrative Expenses: The rise in S&A expenses to $490 million primarily due to higher legal fees and professional consulting costs indicates potential inefficiencies and increased overheads. These expenses if not carefully managed could erode the company's profitability over time.

Story continues

Legal and Regulatory Challenges: IFF faces ongoing legal proceedings and regulatory investigations such as the antitrust investigations into its fragrance businesses. These issues not only incur additional costs but also pose reputational risks and could lead to significant financial penalties.

Opportunities

Productivity Gains and Favorable Net Pricing: IFF has demonstrated the ability to achieve productivity gains and secure favorable net pricing as reflected in the increased Segment Adjusted Operating EBITDA for its Nourish and Scent segments. These achievements provide an opportunity for IFF to further enhance its operational efficiency and pricing strategies to boost profitability.

Focus on Health & Biosciences: The Health & Biosciences segment showed a sales increase indicating strong market demand for biotechnology-derived products. IFF's position in this segment offers significant growth potential particularly in the areas of probiotics enzymes and specialty ingredients which are increasingly sought after in the health and wellness markets.

Emerging Markets Expansion: With sales to Israeli and Russian customers representing a small percentage of total sales there is an opportunity for IFF to expand its presence in emerging markets. By leveraging its global footprint and diverse product portfolio IFF can tap into new customer bases and drive sales growth.

Threats

Competitive Industry Landscape: IFF operates in a highly competitive industry where innovation and customer preferences rapidly evolve. The company must continuously adapt to maintain its market position against competitors who may offer more innovative or cost-effective solutions.

Regulatory and Compliance Risks: The complexity of operating in multiple jurisdictions brings about various regulatory challenges. IFF's involvement in legal disputes and the necessity to comply with diverse regulations can lead to increased compliance costs and potential disruptions to its business operations.

Global Economic Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the potential impacts of the Israel-Hamas war could disrupt IFF's supply chains and affect its sales. The company must navigate these uncertainties while managing the risks associated with its international operations.

In conclusion International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (NYSE:IFF) exhibits a strong financial foundation with improved gross profit margins and strategic portfolio management. However the company must address its increased S&A expenses and navigate legal and regulatory complexities. Opportunities for growth lie in its Health & Biosciences segment and potential expansion into emerging markets. Nevertheless IFF must remain vigilant against competitive pressures and global economic uncertainties that pose threats to its operational stability. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses IFF can capitalize on opportunities and mitigate threats positioning itself for continued success in the specialty ingredients industry.

Positive Points

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF Financial) achieved volume growth for the first time since Q1 2022 with mid-single digit growth in Q1 2024 driven by strong contributions from Scent Nourish and Health & Biosciences segments.

The company reported double-digit comparable adjusted EBITDA growth benefiting from both volume growth and productivity gains across its businesses.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF) successfully closed the divestiture of its cosmetics ingredients business and announced the sale of its Pharma Solutions business which is expected to complete in the first half of 2025 aiding in strengthening the capital structure and focusing on high-growth areas.

Negative Points

The CFO Glenn Richter announced his plan to retire at the end of 2024 initiating a succession plan that could lead to transitional challenges within the financial leadership of the company.

Despite positive volume growth the company noted that pricing was modestly positive and would have been negative without FX-related pricing benefits indicating underlying challenges in pricing power.

The company's Pharma Solutions segment experienced lower volumes due to ongoing destocking trends which could impact short-term performance until the completion of its divestiture.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc (IFF) reported a negative free cash flow of $19 million in Q1 2024 although it was an improvement from the previous year highlighting ongoing challenges in cash flow generation.

The company's net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA ratio stood at 4.4x at quarter end indicating a relatively high leverage that the company aims to reduce to 3x following the Pharma Solutions transaction.

The idea seems deceptively simple: pay landowners to manage their land in a way that traps carbon usually by not cutting down trees or planting certain crops and then force polluters to buy carbon “credits” to counter their emissions.

But in Maine the timber industry and small woodlot owners have not taken to the programs another frustrating hurdle on the long path to controlling global warming.

Even though the market has been around for decades only 3.5% of the state’s large landowners have made deals to sell their carbon.

“It’s kind of a lost opportunity” said John Hagan president of Our Climate Common a group working with the University of Maine to figure out how to get commercial landowners who account for most of Maine’s timberland owners to participate in the programs.

Small woodlot owners have also been reluctant to buy in citing payments too low to justify the costs of complying with rigorous standards.

Last fall a task force appointed by the governor came up with recommendations on ways to persuade Maine’s 86000 small landowners — those with between 10 and 10000 acres — to keep their forests as forests. The state is losing about 10000 acres of land to development each year as owners age and entrepreneurs snap up parcels for everything from housing to solar arrays.

The goal of carbon offset programs is to “make a tree worth as much — if not more — up than it is down” said Tommie Elder director of Forest Carbon Origination at bluesource a company that helps landowners navigate the carbon offset marketplace. Trees store more carbon alive than dead so keeping forests standing is key to lowering the amount of greenhouse gasses contributing to global warming.

It’s also an essential step in meeting the state’s goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2045 and could provide other benefits such as reducing habitat fragmentation and increasing biodiversity.

Until recently it’s been hard to get small landowners to participate in carbon offset programs because the costs to participate haven’t been justified by the payments per acre. Such programs the argument goes typically only make sense for large landowners those with tens of thousands or millions of acres under management.

Except that carbon offset programs don’t seem to make sense for them either.

Much of the hesitation from commercial woodlot owners comes down to time and money. Programs require landowners to keep forest as forest for decades — some up to a century — which often isn’t attractive to companies that don’t plan on owning the land that long.

Carbon offset programs don’t necessarily mean trees can’t be cut down and sold as lumber — depending on the forest it may even make sense to cut certain trees and select others that will store more carbon in the long run.

But that type of management is typically more time-consuming and expensive and may be different from what a landowner has done in the past. Plus once they’re paid for that carbon landowners have to count and verify it for however long it’s in the program.

“Landowners know that so they say between the 100-year requirement and your requiring me to change behavior in some way and document that there’s going to be more carbon those two things alone just make it not worth it” said Hagan.

It’s too bad he added because “There’s a lot of bang for the buck there. You get one company all of a sudden you’ve got a million acres to work with. It’s a lot faster than finding 10000 small woodlot owners who agree on something.”

The California compliance market (so-called because it enrolls companies who are required to offset their emissions) was the first opportunity for Maine landowners who wanted to participate in carbon offset programs said Dan Hudnut president of Wagner Forest Management which has about 2.4 million acres under management in the Northeast 800000 of it in Maine in an email.

That market was attractive for landowners with an above-average number of trees per acre “who didn’t really like to cut wood and who intended to hold the property long term” said Hudnut.

But the emergence of that market in 2013 coincided in Maine with an increase in land ownership by investment companies who often planned to own the land for between 10 to 15 years far less than the decades-long ownership that had been common among families and even paper mills who needed a continuous supply.

“I don’t even know if they knew where Maine was” said Hagan of the investors who came into Maine in the 1990s and early 2000s. “They were just investing in timberland around the world.” They needed annual returns for shareholders and wanted to keep open the possibility of selling the land to developers down the road rather than locking it up for decades in carbon offset programs.

The more recent emergence of voluntary carbon markets open to companies that aren’t required to but want to offset their emissions has attracted more commercial landowners in recent years said Hudnut. Contracts tend to be shorter-term (40 years) and landowners can be paid for not cutting “as hard as the law allows.”

But Wagner has become more hesitant the more it learns said Hudnut.

For one the company is skeptical that entering into a carbon agreement would actually change the amount of carbon stored or sequestered in Maine (or the world) over the next four decades said Hudnut.

There’s also the problem of demand. The world’s appetite for wood products is increasing with architects exploring wood as an alternative to emissions-heavy concrete and steel and as a way to reduce the 40% of global emissions the U.N. estimates come from the construction and building industry.

Annual global cement production alone is thought to account for 8 percent of emissions according to a report by the think tank Chatham House (compared to 3 percent for the shipping industry). Once it’s standing operating a building — heating and cooling it lighting it — can also emit a lot of greenhouse gasses.

Wood presents a potential alternative. “Wood products are a great place to store carbon long term and have significantly better carbon footprints than steel and concrete” said Hudnut.

If Maine landowners stop cutting wood it’s still going to need to come from somewhere (a problem known in the carbon offset industry as “leakage”) possibly from “forests somewhere on the globe that are not as well managed” said Hudnut causing the state’s industry and rural communities to suffer. Carbon credit payments only go to landowners after all not to people working in the forest or living in towns supported by that labor.

“Until global aggregate demand is magically reduced we think the Maine forests should be producing and contributing more sustainably grown renewable products to regional and global markets.”

Maine’s commercial timberland owners who are trading cash for carbon however say the programs whatever their flaws may actually result in healthier more sustainably managed forests.

“There is a huge incompatibility with good stewardship and capitalism” said Kyle Burdick the woodlands manager at Baskahegan Company which has 88000 acres under management in eastern Maine almost all enrolled in carbon offset programs. “This is the first time we’ve ever been financially reimbursed for doing good forestry.”

The nonprofit Nature Conservancy also has carbon offset deals for about 75% of a 160000-acre parcel along the upper St. John River which it bought from International Paper 23 years ago.

Getting paid to sequester carbon has resulted in significant management changes that wouldn’t have made financial sense otherwise said Mark Berry the Conservancy’s forest program director.

That includes setting aside roughly half the land as an ecological reserve an area Berry described as a place where “nature is allowed to take its course.” In areas where cutting has continued harvesting is limited to no more than 15% of the growth each year allowing TNC to be paid an annual stipend for sequestering more and more carbon.

Some have criticized conservation organizations for participating in carbon offset programs since their mission is already to conserve forests not harvest them. The real value critics argue lies in saving trees that were in danger of being cut not those that were going to be preserved regardless.

Berry countered that the money it gets from carbon credit sales has helped TNC purchase other tracts of land for preservation contributing to the overarching goal of keeping forests as forests.

“Across any type of private owner there is uncertainty about the future” said Berry. “Someone may manage the property really well until something changes in their financial circumstances something changes in their life. They have college tuition to pay or medical bills or they lose their job and then they either suddenly do a timber harvest to get the revenue that they need or they sell the property. Then somebody comes along that may not have a long-term perspective and may not be doing the kind of (forest management) that improves things for the future.”

“Carbon projects are not the goal in and of themselves. They’re just a tool to help accomplish a better outcome for the climate as well as for nature and people more broadly” he added.

While those decades-long limitations to keep forests standing may be good for the climate they’re also what make some commercial landowners hesitant to enter into these programs said Burdick.

“Limiting what you can do with the land in the future is the biggest reason I believe most landowners in Maine don’t participate.”

That may be changing. Elder of bluesource said she’s seen more landowners interested in programs as the voluntary marketplace with its lower time commitments has expanded and prices per acre have risen. “Probably about two-thirds of the landowners are in the voluntary market” said Elder. “It’s where we see a lot of potential in Maine and other places.”

And there’s a lot of room for those landowners to make a difference in carbon storage. Maine’s 17.6 million acres of forest may have higher total carbon storage than any other New England state except New York but they have significantly lower carbon storage per acre than anywhere else in the region according to a recent presentation by the Securing Northeast Forest Carbon Program.

Carbon offsets have plenty of critics many of whom argue that the programs allow polluting companies with high levels of emissions to continue business as usual while also capitalizing on the good PR that comes from saying they’ve reduced their carbon footprint.

There’s also the question of what Maine would do to offset its emissions if there was a sudden increase in landowners both small and large participating in the wider carbon offset marketplace since counting our forests as carbon sinks is one of the ways officials are planning to get the state to net-zero emissions by 2045. If those forests are already being counted as offsets by Google or Delta do we have to buy them back or buy credits elsewhere?

Officials have indicated they would subtract those credits from the state’s accounting said Hagan in an email. Right now that’s problematic since Maine calculates forest carbon completely differently than how it’s calculated for the marketplace said Hagan.

State officials say Maine’s forests and forest products are sequestering an amount of carbon equal to 75% of the state’s fossil fuel emissions. But that assertion “will not hold up to scrutiny in the well-developed carbon marketplace” wrote Hagan and his colleague Lloyd C. Irland in a 2020 letter to the Maine Climate Council.

For one it’s not clear the figure takes into account considerations common in most programs like leakage (being as sure as possible that if we stop cutting down trees here they’re not being cut down elsewhere) and the idea that for a forest to be legitimately counted as an offset it shouldn’t be one that was never going to be cut anyway.

The state is also counting carbon that had been claimed by California said Hagan and counting carbon it doesn’t own or control given that 90% of forested land in Maine is in private hands.

“That carbon does not ‘belong’ to the state” Hagan and Irland wrote. “Unless the state wants to get in the business of controlling what happens to privately owned carbon we think it is risky at best to include carbon over which the state has no control in an accounting framework.”

Despite all of carbon counting’s “zillion problems” said Hagan both he and Berry think carbon markets are a way to reward landowners for practicing sustainable forest management practices and keep forests as forests.

“There may be cases where carbon projects produce a modest climate benefit or less dramatic climate benefit than some would hope” said Berry. “But if they helped to keep forests on the landscape they’re still doing some good.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi8wNS8wNy9hLWZsb3RpbGxhLW9mLXN0YXJ0dXBzLXdhbnRzLXRvLXN0cmVhbWxpbmUtZ2xvYmFsLXN1cHBseS1jaGFpbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A flotilla of startups wants to streamline global supply chains,"F ORTO SEEMS an unlikely tech darling.

Over the last decade commitments to restore hundreds of millions of hectares of degraded land have arisen thick and fast.

The Bonn Challenge Forest and Landscape Restoration Mechanism of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) New York Declaration on Forests African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative (AFR100) Initiative 20×20 Great Green Wall Partnerships for Forests the Manila Declaration on Forests and most recently the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use signed and sealed at the U.N. COP26 climate summit last year.

These non-binding commitments led to a flurry of enthusiasm for tree-planting inspiring myriad initiatives around the world led by governments the private sector environmental groups and individual enthusiasts.

Increasing forest cover leads to carbon capture reducing the planet-warming gases released into the atmosphere a key part of the fight against climate change.

The U.N. Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030) targeted toward youth through a “Generation Restoration” social media campaign also launched last year serving as a de facto umbrella dedicated to raising awareness of the pitfalls of degraded lands.

As momentum for tree planting initiatives grew while applauded by the Center for International Forestry Research and World Agroforestry (CIFOR-ICRAF) fears grew over the potential risks of overplanting of invasive species which encroach on native species and often take over with negative consequences for local livelihoods flora and fauna.

In response CIFOR-ICRAF produced “Principles for Successful Tree Planting” a guide cautioning planters to “plant the right tree for the right place and the right purpose.”

But the increase in tree-planting initiatives also led to concerns over whether the species planted were actually surviving – if they were left to fend for themselves without being cared for or nurtured and dying off.

In this vein at that time we thought it timely to report CIFOR-ICRAF research that aimed to provide a detailed and nuanced interpretation of challenges faced by the National Greening Program in the Philippines.

It summarized work carried out in collaboration with the government of Philippines to develop solutions for upland communities to restore land with trees profitably.

Flash forward almost a year and with the World Forestry Congress (WFC) hosted by South Korea in Seoul last week in full swing – where the theme “Turning the tide: reversing deforestation and forest degradation” was one of six under heated debate and discussion — an article published on Britain’s BBC news website drew renewed attention to this critical issue.

The piece titled “How phantom forests are used for greenwashing” – while simplified in relation to the extensive research we produced – drew attention to the critical issue we had previously exposed at CIFOR-ICRAF.

Specifically how can we be sure that the trees being planted actually grow into mature and useable resources?

The BBC article points out the problem that sometimes these replanted forests exist only due to being documented on paper – “because promises have not been kept or because planted trees have died or even been harvested.”

A new effort will now be made to track success and failure the article states adding that the National Greening Program was an attempt to grow 1.5 million hectares of forest and mangroves between 2011 and 2019 but that a report from the country’s Commission on Audit found that in the first five years 88 percent of it had failed.

The article points to the fact that the audit itself is a rare and significant achievement and one which indicates the seriousness of the government’s intent regarding its restoration efforts.

Of perhaps even greater import is the yawning void between the large and growing global investment in tree planting as afforestation reforestation and avoided research and development projects around the world and the absence of any coherent global effort to build the capacities of national audit offices or their equivalents to undertake independent third-party assessments of the success or otherwise of tree planting programs.

Furthermore this deficit is underscored in a quote by Tim Christophersen who was until last month head of Nature for Climate with the U.N. Environment Programme overseeing the U.N. Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. In the BBC article he said that “of the 1 billion hectares of landscape that countries have promised to restore worldwide ‘most’ remains a promise rather than a reality.”

With all this in mind we thought it prudent to dust the cobwebs off our story “Trees on paper or trees to sustain livelihoods?” from last year to give our findings about the National Greening Program another airing.

It aims to provide a more nuanced and detailed picture of the challenges facing the National Greening Program based on the research CIFOR-ICRAF was invited to conduct in the Philippines in 2020-2021.

Given that the demand for more and more agricultural land is perhaps the greatest driver of deforestation researchers are investigating how best to help re-establish the ecological health of degraded land while also providing multiple socio-economic benefits from sustainable land management.

Researchers with CIFOR-ICRAF are at the forefront of this research examining how to benefit smallholder livelihoods by improving value chains while at the same time protecting and enhancing the environment.

For the National Greening Program these efforts were part of technical support provided to an ambitious land restoration project Integrated Natural Resources and Environmental Management Project (INREMP) implemented by the Philippines Department of Environment and Natural Resources with funding from the Asian Development Bank.

It operated in 23 watersheds extending over 11385.54 sq km with an estimated population of around 1.8 million. Roughly 223000 households in nine provinces 81 cities and municipalities and some 1332 local governments were involved.

In these watershed areas natural resources are the primary source of domestic energy while local production and forest ecosystems play a crucial role in the local economy.

INREMP introduced sustainable options such as boosting the use of agroforestry commercial forestry plantations and conservation farming enhancing the viability and economic contributions of forest-based industries through private investment ensuring wide participation and equitable sharing of benefits and improving governance.

CIFOR-ICRAF technical support focused on civil society organizations that have been working with the government since the adoption of the national community-based forest management strategy 25 years ago.

For INREMP we prepared a series of reviews and reports on this topic (see links below).

ENABLING ENVIRONMENT

Although previously a leading producer of timber in Southeast Asia the Philippines has been a net importer of forest products for more than 30 years.

Despite pouring billions of pesos into reforestation programs for decades the focus remains on meeting tree-planting targets — at least on paper — rather than supporting the emergence of self-reliant community-based forestry enterprises.

Seedling production represented 34 percent of the total cost of the National Greening which after its first phase began in 2011 was followed by the Enhanced National Greening Program in 2016. A 2019 audit report recommended sub-contracting people’s organizations to produce the tree seedlings themselves which would lead to better care.

Other positive developments can be seen in the Caraga Region — the so-called “timber corridor” of the Philippines — which provides around 70 percent of the timber produced in the country. The department at regional level has provided a more enabling environment to encourage tree growing by smallholders for a well-established timber market.

For example the Balungagan Farmers’ Association made up of around 90 farmers has benefited from a series of tree-planting projects over the years. Now leading viable businesses success is in large measure due to land tenure security achieved through an official Community-Based Forest Management Agreement.

However challenges remain in part because the complex matrix under which the forestry sector is governed.

Establishing a clearer simpler and more stable policy framework would be a big step toward better administrative planning oversight and monitoring.

RECOGNIZING RIGHTS

In our work with the Philippines we learned that securing greater clarity in tenure instruments issued for forest lands is also a critical move for overseeing tree planting.

Currently only 38 percent of production forests are under some form of tenurial agreement.

It is crucial that ambiguity over access and harvesting rights for timber and non-timber forest resources is resolved as the government is in the process of transferring rights to forest resources back to Indigenouscommunities.

Management capacity for oversight must also be developed in local government units and other third-party forest managers such as people’s organizations cooperatives and small-to-medium-sized enterprises.

Organizing farmers for effective training and capacity building related to the establishment and management of tree-based enterprises is also key.

Mainstreaming an accreditation system for people’s organizations developed on the basis of guidelines under certification schemes including the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) which oversees the widely recognized ethical international process for certifying that wood-based products are sustainably produced.

Other recommendations include establishing fair and transparent benefit-sharing in government forest restoration programs.

The BBC article makes mention of a new voluntary monitoring guideline for landscape restoration projects introduced by FAO which includes 20 indicators designed to develop the capacity of countries to measure and report progress with greater transparency.

In our view this will be invaluable but we believe that independent audits are also crucial for governments that want to do more than pay lip service to landscape restoration initiatives.

The FTC claimed that in 2020 alone two-thirds of eligible filers couldn't use TurboTax Free Edition including gig workers and people who earned farm income. Investigators said Intuit also engaged in deceptive marketing and trade practices including intentionally blocking its IRS Free File landing page from search engine results.

The company also lured people in with ads that touted its free edition ""only to deceive them into paying"" according to New York Attorney General Letitia James who brokered the multistate settlement.

""For years Intuit misled the most vulnerable among us to make a profit"" James said in a May 4 statement. ""This agreement should serve as a reminder to companies large and small that engaging in these deceptive marketing ploys is illegal.""



In a statement Intuit admitted no wrongdoing and said it agreed to the deal to ""put this matter behind it.""

Below find out if you qualify what you need to do to receive compensation and how much money affected customers can expect to get from the settlement.

Who qualifies for the TurboTax settlement?

Intuit is providing restitution to nearly 4.4 million people in all 50 states who used TurboTax's Free Edition between tax years 2016 and 2018.

These people were told they had to pay to file even though they qualified for the IRS Free File program a partnership between the agency and major tax prep software companies. Individuals and families with an adjusted gross income of less than $73000 are typically eligible for the Free File program as are members of the military.

How do I find out if I qualify?

No action needs to be taken according to Halimah Elmariah a spokesperson for the New York State Attorney's Office. Eligible TurboTax users will receive notification either in an email or letter.

Impacted customers will receive approximately $30 for each year that they were deceived into paying for filing services. Naomi Antonino/CNET

How do I file a settlement claim with TurboTax?

If you qualify you will automatically receive a direct payment of approximately $30 for each year that they were deceived into paying for filing services according to James' office.

The checks will come from the $141 million settlement minus $2.5 million in administrative costs.

When will I receive a payment?

Because the settlement involves multiple states payments will be handled through a third-party administrator. An exact timeline hasn't been determined yet but Elmariah told CNET she expects checks would be sent out in the next few months.

(WBAY) - We have three items in your Consumer First Alert this week.

CALUMET COUNTY SOFTWARE PHONE SCAM

The Calumet County Sheriff’s Office says residents in the Village of Harrison have lost about $78000 to a computer software scam.

Officials say they’ve received multiple fraud complaints from Harrison residents.

In each case the victims received phone calls instructing them to download software to their computer or mobile device. The scammers were then able to gain access to banking and investment accounts set up on the device.

The suspects quickly exchange funds to cryptocurrency. Officials say that’s difficult to track and ends up overseas where it will likely never be recovered.

The Sheriff’s Office says never allow a third party to access your computer or mobile device. Do not agree to make payments in the form of gift cards. Legitimate businesses will never take that as payment.

“If you find yourself on the phone with someone telling you they need to access your computer or mobile device or demanding a payment in gift cards the best thing to do is hang up and if the scammer calls back do not answer the call and block that phone number” reads a statement from the Sheriff’s Office.

UNEMPLOYMENT TEXT SCAMS

Unemployment text scams are trying to catch people off guard.

A viewer shared a text message that claims there’s a $7200 deposit in your unemployment account and it includes a link. Do not click on it.

The Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development has warned about these scams. It was a big issue during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Do not click on random messages or respond to them. Don’t give out your personal information.

TURBOTAX REFUND

Some TurboTax customers are getting a refund. It’s part of a $141 million settlement in all 50 states.

Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul says 7600 TurboTax filers in Wisconsin will share $2370000 as part of the settlement.

Investigators say Intuit the owner of the tax filing software company lured in low-income customers with its free campaign ad steering them away from the IRS Free File Program.

Intuit also agreed to reform business practices and its disclosures on free products.

People are expected to get about $30 for each year they were deceived for tax years 2016-2018.

Impacted customers will receive notices and a check in the mail.

Bill Gates doesn't own most U.S. farmland; BlackRock doesn't own most houses

08 May2022 11:55 pm

(Reuters) Claims online that billionaire Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates owns the majority of U.S. farmland and that BlackRock the world’s largest asset manager owns the majority of U.S. single-family houses are factually inaccurate according to industry data and spokespeople for Gates and BlackRock.

“Bill Gates is buying up the majority of American farmland and BlackRock is buying the majority of single-family houses but I m supposed to believe the biggest threat to us is Elon Musk buying Twitter?” one Twitter user wrote. The tweet had gathered over 215000 likes at the time of writing. An archived version of the tweet can be found (archive.ph/8Tq36).

— Mercedes Schlapp (@mercedesschlapp) April 27 2022

Another meme circulating online reads: “Bill Gates is buying all the farmland. Recently Bill Gates has purchased 300000 acres of farmland you would think that buying all of the farmland would be bigger news than Elon Musk buying all of Twitter (here) (here).

BILL GATES AND U.S. FARMLAND

Gates does not own the majority of U.S. farmland.

Reuters traced the figure cited by social media posts as the number of acres owned by Bill Gates to ‘The Land Report’ which reports on major land ownership in the United States. The figure cited by The Land Report was subsequently reported by major news outlets including Business Insider and Forbes.

According to a January 2021 article by ‘The Land Report’ Gates owned 242000 acres of farmland through two investment management firms - Cottonwood Ag Management and Cascade Investment.

The figure is far below the total area of U.S. farmland. A 2021 report published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said there were 895300000 acres of farmland in the United States. Using those figures Gates would own about 0.027% of U.S. farmland.

A spokesperson for Gates also told Reuters the claim that Gates owns the majority of U.S. farmland was false pointing to the USDA figures.

In a statement to Reuters editor of ‘The Land Report’ and author of the article published by the outlet on farmland owned by Gates Eric O’ Keefe called the claim “absurd.”

While Gates does not own the majority of U.S. farmland he is the largest private farmland owner according to ‘The Land Report’.

BLACKROCK AND SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES

While BlackRock does not directly own single-family houses as the world’s largest asset manager (here) it owns stock in companies that do. But these companies do not own a majority of U.S. single-family homes.

Invitation Homes for example has approximately 80000 homes for lease across the country and is the largest landlord for single-family homes in the United States. American Homes 4 Rent holds around 57024 single-family properties. BlackRock is a shareholder in both companies.

There are 94.6 million single-family houses in the United States according to the latest data available from the U.S. Census Bureau American Housing Survey (2019) (bit.ly/3seI7kV). As of the latest Rental Housing Finance Survey (2018) there were 19.955 million rental properties in the United States (bit.ly/3FdPtKZ) 17.16 million of them single unit rental properties (bit.ly/3KLCjWH). Just over 70% of these were owned by individual investors. For context Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent’s combined homes would be less than 1% of the 17.16 million homes if total housing numbers stayed the same in the last three years.

Contacted by Reuters a BlackRock spokesperson said: “BlackRock is not buying single-family homes and is not competing with individuals to purchase houses in America.”

Business entities have however been increasing their presence as owners of rental properties. According to the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies (JCHS) using data of the Rental Housing Finance Survey between 2001 and 2018 the proportion of rental properties owned by non-individual investors which include partnerships trustees for estate real estate corporations real estate investment trusts and other entities increased from 18% to 26%.

Real estate investors overall have also been increasingly targeting single-family homes. According to Redfin single-family housing represented over 70% of the properties purchased by investors in the third quarter of 2021.

VERDICT

False. Bill Gates does not own the majority of U.S. farmland. As of 2020 industry reports show he owned about 0.027% of U.S. farmland. While private companies and corporations are increasing their ownership of U.S. homes BlackRock through its investments does not own a majority of single-family homes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL21pc2Jhci5jb20vZW4vZmFjdGNoZWNrLzIwMjIvMDUvMDcvbWlzbGVhZGluZy1jbGFpbXMtYWJvdXQtYmlsbC1nYXRlcy1hbmQtYmxhY2tyb2NrLW93bmluZy10aGUtbWFqb3JpdHktb2YtZmFybWxhbmQtYW5kLXNpbmdsZS1mYW1pbHktaG9tZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bill Gates and Blackrock Do Not Own the Majority of Farmland and Single-family Homes in the US | Misbar,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXBsZXNuZXdzLmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9kaW5pbmcvMjAyMi8wNS8wOC9uYXBsZXMtY2hlZi1hc2lmLXN5ZWQtMjEtc3BpY2VzLXdoaXRlLWhvdXNlLWVpZC1hbC1maXRyLWNlbGVicmF0aW9uLzk2NjYwMjEwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Naples Chef Asif Syed of 21 Spices at the White House for Eid celebration.,"NDN gallery: Chef Asif Syed's White House visit to celebrate Eid al-Fitr

He attended an intercity visit to northwest Arkansas which was organized by the Greater Topeka Partnership and the Lawrence Chamber of Commerce. These are his observations.

This year's intercity trip to northwest Arkansas not only brought together not only leaders in Topeka but also Lawrence for the four-hour ride to the south.

The trips at least for Topeka aren't a new concept. City and county leaders Greater Topeka Partnership staff and any member of the public willing to pay the ticket price have taken trips to other cities to gather knowledge on a particular theme or concept to be replicated back home.

In 2014 it was Tulsa Okla. to learn about its riverwalk development. The last one before the COVID-19 pandemic began was Montgomery Ala. in 2019 to learn about its diversity and inclusion efforts.

This year northwest Arkansas or NWA as the locals call it was chosen for the efforts by cities to brand the region as a whole.

More:'We are not only citizens of Kansas': Kansas National Guard shares uplifting message

So what actually happened and why should you care?

The knowledge shared between city leaders may translate into changes in Topeka and Lawrence.

Through listening to Arkansas city chambers and elected officials underlying themes bubbled to the top.

One is the importance of having big business headquartered in the area giving heavy investments into the community. Walmart Tyson and J.B. Hunt are all located in northwest Arkansas and have accelerated growth on numerous fronts including the construction of a new regional airport.

Next is the ability for cities to work together to achieve overall economic growth. Local leaders believe what's good for one city is good for all of northwest Arkansas.

Another is having a reason to visit the area or a ""draw."" For Northwest Arkansas it's outdoor enjoyment and cultural infusion.

The trail systems alone have helped to brand the region as a mecca for mountain biking. Dozens of world-class routes have been created to take advantage of the landscape topography. That includes the Razorback Regional Greenway a 37.5-mile stretch of trail connecting Fayetteville to Belle Vista.

Culture-wise the region has some offerings you may not have expected. Springdale officials in particular liked to tout its Marshallese population as second only to the small island chain. The University of Arkansas in Fayetteville also was emphasized as helping to attract different demographics. And artwork and vendors can also be seen almost anywhere you look.

That's great for Arkansas. But what about Topeka and Lawrence?

Seeing how other regions work together for common goals could be a start for local officials which also could include Manhattan.

What runs through all those cities? The Kansas River. Maybe thinking back to the Tulsa trip and its riverfront development could spark new interest as a draw to the region.

Kaw River State Park is choking with invasive non-native plants. Here's what you can do to help.

Just like Arkansas biking is becoming a popular sport in Kansas. Events like Unbound Gravel formerly known as the Dirty Kanza and the formation of National Interscholastic Cycling Association teams popping up across the state show the interest is there — even if mountains aren't.

We may not have the Walton family but we do have corporations in the animal health corridor and a future innovation campus with the Plug-And-Play Topeka cohort that could make our area a hub for businesses.

As seen in northwest Arkansas if a business chooses to build in one city it helps the whole region.

Embracing our heritage through public artwork and celebrating such historic landmarks as the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site are examples of ways we are showing what makes us unique.

We also share similar ideas on attracting a new workforce. Just like Topeka northwest Arkansas is offering people incentives to move to their communities. Having a reason to want to stay seems to be a key.

There are a lot of takeaways for city and community leaders to take from this trip. Aspects of working as a region importance of being welcomed at the table recognizing what makes a place unique and bringing in commerce are just a few.

Visiting northwest Arkansas inspired many ideas. Which ones come to fruition and how are yet to be determined.

*GAAP revenue is comprised of services and support and processing revenues (see page 2). Reducing services and support revenue by deconversion revenue for the three months ended March 31 2024 and 2023 which was $843 for the current fiscal year quarter and $6143 for the prior fiscal year quarter results in non-GAAP adjusted services and support revenue growth of 6.4% quarter over quarter. There were no non-GAAP adjustments to processing revenue for the three months ended March 31 2024 and 2023. Reducing services and support revenue by deconversion revenue for the nine months ended March 31 2024 and 2023 which was $9861 for the current fiscal year-to-date period and $17042 for the prior fiscal year-to-date period and by $2 of revenue from acquisition in the current fiscal year-to-date period results in non-GAAP adjusted services and support revenue growth of 7.2% period over period. Reducing processing revenue by revenue from acquisition for the nine months ended March 31 2024 which was $1943 results in non-GAAP adjusted processing revenue growth of 8.5% year-to-date period over year-to-date period. **The VEDIP program expense for the nine months ended March 31 2024 was related to a Company voluntary separation program offered to certain eligible employees beginning in July 2023. ***Non-GAAP adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing non-GAAP adjusted operating income by non-GAAP adjusted revenue.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting in the United States. GAAP includes the standards conventions and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP we have provided certain non-GAAP financial measures including adjusted revenue adjusted operating income adjusted segment income adjusted cost of revenue adjusted operating expenses adjusted operating margin adjusted segment income margin non-GAAP earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (non-GAAP EBITDA) free cash flow return on invested capital (ROIC) and non-GAAP adjusted net income.

We believe non-GAAP financial measures help investors better understand the underlying fundamentals and true operations of our business. Adjusted revenue adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted segment income adjusted segment income margin adjusted cost of revenue adjusted operating expenses and adjusted net income eliminate one-time deconversion revenue and associated costs the effects of acquisitions and divestitures the VEDIP program expense and the gain on sale of assets net all of which management believes are not indicative of the Company's operating performance. Such adjustments give investors further insight into our performance. Non-GAAP EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to the Company before the effect of interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted for net income before the effect of interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization attributable to eliminated one-time deconversions acquisitions and divestitures the VEDIP program expense and the gain on sale of assets net. Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities less capitalized expenditures internal use software and capitalized software plus proceeds from the sale of assets. ROIC is defined as net income divided by average invested capital which is the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and stockholders' equity for a given period. Management believes that non-GAAP EBITDA is an important measure of the Company's overall operating performance and excludes certain costs and other transactions that management deems one time or non-operational in nature; free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for debt service requirements and strategic capital decisions; and ROIC is a measure of the Company's allocation efficiency and effectiveness of its invested capital. For these reasons management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its assessment and management of the Company's performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable with calculations of similar measures for other companies.

Any non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to related GAAP measures are included.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can and often do change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available pricing information was not collected or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

ARAPAHOE COUNTY Colo. — When a man in a rural part of Arapahoe County called 911 for help during a mental health crisis he asked for a sheriff’s deputy to take him to a facility that could treat his condition.

But when the deputy patted the man down he found the man had brass knuckles — a prohibited weapon — and the man received a ticket.

The man who has a wife and kids and had served in the military was facing jail time. But the staff at the Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office reached out to the right officials and gave the man a referral to mental health services and his criminal charge was eventually dismissed.

“That was a really good story we recently had” said Julie Jacobs manager for the sheriff’s office’s Behavioral Health Response Program. Jacobs said the story is about an east Arapahoe County man who spent about three months going back and forth with the court system earlier this year.

Deputies can’t ignore evidence of a crime Jacobs said but the mental health staff at the sheriff’s office tries to put the focus on getting help for people in mental health crisis instead of putting them on a path to jail.

That staff includes a team of mental health “coresponders” who react to 911 calls alongside deputies to handle mental health-related situations with the delicate nature they sometimes require. The sheriff’s office started its coresponder program in October 2019 and it has made thousands of contacts since then according to the sheriff’s office.

Coresponders will never ask deputies not to charge an individual with a crime when it goes against policies or state law according to Ginger Delgado a spokesperson for the sheriff’s office. But not all crimes are “mandatory arrest” situations Delgado said in a statement.

A person can be “diverted” away from jail if a deputy determines that the person can be released with a court summons or pending charges according to Delgado.

“If we can legally and ethically and morally keep them in the community to get the (mental health) services that’s what we want to do” said Jacobs who oversees the coresponder program.

Coresponders are clinicians who have their own unmarked vehicles with a partition in the back so they can transport people to emergency rooms crisis walk-in centers or other treatment facilities — or they can provide transportation to other locations when appropriate according to the sheriff’s office.

That approach allows the team to avoid using ambulances which would require a bill to families Jacobs said. What’s more the coresponders can handle situations without placing people in handcuffs.

“We’ve been called out to some schools before as well. What’s better for a 15- (or) 16-year-old kid? To be put in handcuffs and put in a police vehicle?” Jacobs said adding “We’re not making them feel like they did something wrong.”

Since the start of October 2019 the coresponder program has had nearly 4200 contacts according to the sheriff’s office.

In 2021 just over 41% of all calls for service that a coresponder assisted with were not seen as mental health-related when the call was initially placed to 911 or a non-emergency line according to Delgado’s statement.

Examples of calls not related to mental health can include verbal disturbances physical disturbances and trespassing according to the office.

Coresponders can respond to any type of call except death investigations or other violent crimes where an arrest is mandatory and a “significant criminal investigation” is needed Delgado’s statement said.

The types of crime for which the coresponder team is not allowed to “divert” people include domestic violence charges and other crimes of violence according to the office.

But even if an arrest is required the coresponder can still provide information — such as whether the person may be at risk for suicide or whether they need medications — to the county jail’s medical staff according to Jacobs.

People who have contact with the program who are not arrested may be treated on scene if they do not request to be taken to a mental health treatment facility for a voluntary assessment — or if they do not meet criteria for what’s called an “M1 hold” according to the office.

Under Colorado law when a person appears to be an imminent danger to others or to themselves due to a mental health disorder the person can be taken into custody and placed in a mental health treatment facility for an up to 72-hour treatment and evaluation.

Whether that “M1” or mental health hold takes 72 hours is up to the physician in charge — it could take five hours Jacobs said depending on the situation.

In 2021 the sheriff’s office wrote roughly 500 mental health holds according to Jacobs. In 2020 the number was about the same.

But the rate at which the office authorized mental health holds in those years was different. In 2020 the number of overall mental health contacts coresponders were involved with was 1645. And that was when the team was operating with at the most three coresponders Jacobs said.

In 2021 the number of contacts was much higher: about 2400 mental health contacts. So proportionally the office wrote less holds in 2021 than in the prior year a change that goes toward one of the goals of the coresponder program Jacobs said.

“We want to make sure we’re providing the most appropriate level of care. An emergency room at a hospital” might not be best Jacobs said. The program tries to take people to “designated mental health facilities” if possible and it can be beneficial if the program can get people to go to a walk-in center she added.

Out of the nearly 4200 calls since the program began there were only 88 individuals arrested on scene for warrants and new charges according to the office.

But it’s important to note that the coresponder program’s implementation came shortly before the coronavirus pandemic reached Colorado a change that resulted in the county needing to modify the requirements for who is placed in jail along with courts changing procedures Delgado’s statement said.

“Many charges that a person — mentally ill or not — would generally be arrested and detained on prior to COVID-19 were released on a summons” Delgado’s statement said. The most recent change to the jail acceptance policy was March 11 this year.

On that date the sheriff’s office lowered the jail placement criteria so that crimes that result in $1000 bonds and above would place a suspect in jail according to Carl Anderson an administrative manager with the Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office. Allowing for more suspects to be put in jail is a reaction to the spread of COVID and COVID-related hospitalizations having recently come down at the time according to Anderson.

(In late April Colorado Community Media asked the sheriff’s office how many of the nearly 4200 coresponder-involved calls resulted in writing someone a ticket for an alleged law violation. The office’s records unit said it was still working on the question as of May 2.)

When a coresponder is unavailable to respond to a call deputies can fill out a referral form for mental health staff to later follow up with the person who needed help.

At the start of the coresponder program the sheriff’s office contracted with AllHealth Network and was assigned one part-time clinician or coresponder until a contract was signed in January 2020.

AllHealth Network is a nonprofit mental health organization that provides counseling psychiatry crisis services substance use treatment and other services and has locations in Littleton and elsewhere in the south Denver metro area.

The program had three coresponders and one case manager starting at that time Jacobs said.

In January 2021 AllHealth Network and the sheriff’s office decided against resigning a contract and with the support of the Centennial City Council and Arapahoe County commissioners the sheriff’s office brought the program “in house” according to the sheriff’s office.

Three of the current coresponders are former AllHealth employees who chose to come over and work for the program “in house” — meaning they’re now employed by the sheriff’s office — and the sheriff’s office hired its other two current coresponders in October through an external job posting Jacobs said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9rcGNuZXdzL25hbWUvamFjb2Itc2Nob2VuaGVyci1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNDc5NzA4MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jacob Schoenherr Obituary (2022) - Auburn IN - KPCNews,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/kpcnews/name/jacob-schoenherr-obituary?id=34797082 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9rcGNuZXdzL25hbWUvamFjb2Itc2Nob2VuaGVyci1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNDc5NzA4MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZXJneS5nb3YvdGVjaG5vbG9neXRyYW5zaXRpb25zL3JvYmVydC1naWxsYW0tbWNraW5sZXktY2FwaXRhbC1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LWxsY9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert A.

This argument has intellectual force but is difficult to make politically. It was interesting though how keen Rees-Mogg was to lean into it.

Equally noticeable was Rees-Mogg’s desire not to pile into Starmer on the whole question of his campaign trail curry and beer when tier 2 restrictions were in place. In contrast to Nadine Dorries Johnson’s other most loyal Cabinet ally Rees-Mogg was arguing for something close to a general indulgence on these issues so the country could focus on cost of living the ‘pre-eminent issue’ facing the country in Rees-Mogg’s words.

Rees-Mogg’s case against a windfall tax on the energy companies was audibly weak. Rees-Mogg said short term rates on companies were not the solutions to the current crisis and the fact that Italy had done it was a reason not to do it. But as Andrew Neil pointed out this was more of a cheap debating trick than an intellectually convincing argument as to why a windfall tax would hit investment."

Marjorie Taylor Greene met for a second day at the Capitol on Tuesday political adversaries trying to engineer an off-ramp from the escalating standoff over her threat for a vote to oust him from office.

The stakes are high for both.

Republican Johnson is hoping to avoid a politically fraught outcome in which he would keep his job but only after relying on Democrats who have pledged their support to save him at least this time.

Greene a top ally of Donald Trump faces her own potentially embarrassing setback if her motion to vacate the speaker fizzles as is expected.

“Right now the ball is in Mike Johnson’s court” said Greene R-Ga. “I am so done with words. For me it’s all about actions.”

In a brazen move Greene has forced her way to the negotiating table and outlined four demands — including no more funding for Ukraine as it fights Russia and an end to the Justice Department special counsel’s legal cases against the indicted former president Trump.

Throughout Johnson has tried to portray himself six months on the job since the ouster of then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy as in control of the situation and not beholden to the hard-right forces that have created chaos throughout this session of Congress.

“Look they’ve been very productive discussions. that’s what I’ll say” Johnson R-La. said after Tuesday’s 90-minute meeting.

Johnson downplayed the idea that there was any deal to be made saying the meetings are simply part of his open-door policy to hear out the ideas of fellow Republican lawmakers as is his practice as the new leader.

“It’s not a negotiation” Johnson said.

But it’s clear whether or not Greene proceeds with her plan to call the vote this week — or lets the moment slip away — the threat of removal will trail the speaker’s tenure and force him to consider concessions to the far-right forces to keep members satisfied.

Greene said she had “high expectations” the speaker would deliver.

“This is what people all over the country are screaming for” Greene said Tuesday on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast. “They want to see this vote.”

Another hardline congressman Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky has joined in the meetings and warned Johnson not to draw out a decision.

“If his plan is to drag this out so the pressure comes off of this and to drag it out for weeks or days even without making some movement in our direction then he would just be far better off to have this vote and get it behind him” Massie said.

The effort to oust Johnson has been panned by Trump who gave his nod of support to the speaker and it has failed to gain traction among Republicans leaving Greene almost alone with just a few colleagues on her side.

But the demands Greene is making are mostly popular among Republicans and could be difficult for Johnson to ignore. That gives both her and the speaker incentive to embrace a deal — particularly since Trump would almost certainly be supportive.

In a signal of what’s to come Johnson lashed out at the Justice Department’s two cases from special prosecutor Jack Smith against Trump — over mishandling classified documents as well as the effort to overturn the 2020 election in the runup to the Jan. 6 2021 Capitol attack.

Johnson echoing Greene’s claims of sham trials called the Justice Department cases against Trump “election interference” that “has to stop” as the former president is the party’s presumptive nominee in the 2024 race for the White House.

“President Trump has done nothing wrong here” said Johnson who led one of the defeated president’s legal efforts trying to overturn Biden’s 2020 election victory before the bloody Capitol siege.

Johnson said the House will consider the flow of federal funds to the Justice Department and oversight of the special prosecutor’s office. “Stay tuned” he said.

Greene is also demanding that Johnson abide by the Hastert rule named for another former Republican speaker that requires leaders to proceed with voting on bills only when they have support from the majority of their members.

Relying on the Hastert rule could have tanked congressional support for Ukraine since the recently approved $61 million foreign aid package did not have backing from most Republicans. It passed with Democratic support.

Greene also wants to insist on federal spending reductions championed by Massie which would require a 1% across-the-board cut if Congress fails to pass the regular appropriation bills by the Sept. 30 deadline for the end of the fiscal year. A similar deal was struck last year lending support to the idea.

Other Republicans even if they agree with some of the ideas being proposed are wary of Johnson making any deals with a select few.

“I don’t have a problem with him listening but what I will have a problem with and we had this problem with Speaker McCarthy is when you start making special special deals and hidden deals “said Rep. Kevin Hern R-Okla. “And then people not just conservatives but moderates and everybody else says where’s my deal?”

But ultra-conservative Rep. Tim Burchett R-Tenn. said Greene backing off the motion to vacate for now would be a “a wise move.” He said it signals “she’s going to play her best hand and that’s to get what you can get.”

The speaker is working to show he is in control of the House and not being led by Democrats who are in the minority but have outsized influence because they have provided the votes for much of the consequential issues this Congress.

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries the Democratic leader has emerged as an empowered speaker-in-waiting if Democrats win party control in November. He and his leadership team have promised to vote to table Greene’s motion essentially saving Johnson’s job.

But Johnson insisted Tuesday he has no interest in relinquishing the gavel any time soon. Even though some Republicans have said he should step aside Johnson said he intends to continue leading the House Republicans well into next year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cmVwdWJsaWMuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTgxMzc4L21hcmpvcmllLXRheWxvci1ncmVlbmVzLXJhZ2UtbWlrZS1qb2huc29uLXN1ZGRlbmx5LWZpenpsaW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marjorie Taylor Greene's Rage At Mike Johnson Is Suddenly Fizzling Out,"PODCAST

Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene R-Ga. and Thomas Massie R-Ky. met with Johnson behind closed doors for roughly two hours late Monday afternoon after promising last week to force a House-wide vote on his removal. They declined to give details to reporters immediately after the sit-down but said they would have a follow-up discussion with Johnson on Tuesday.

However Fox News Digital was told they are broadly seeking four points – including no more funding for Ukraine nor special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into former President Trump.

They are also demanding that Johnson vow to block any legislation from getting a House-wide vote unless it has the support of a majority of the House GOP – a longstanding informal provision called the Hastert rule named after a former Republican speaker.

MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FILES MOTION TO OUST SPEAKER JOHNSON

On government funding the conservatives are also pushing Johnson to adhere to the Massie rule which would require automatic federal spending cuts if an agreement is not reached on fiscal year 2025 funding by the Sept. 30 deadline.

Fox News Digital reached out to Greene Massie and Johnson's offices for comment. A spokesman for Greene declined to discuss the contents of a private meeting.

Meanwhile Rep. Paul Gosar R-Ariz. the third GOP rebel who signed onto Greene's motion to vacate the chair – a resolution calling for a House-wide vote on removing the speaker – suggested to reporters on Monday evening that he wanted Johnson to have some more time to change course.

HOUSE DEMS SAY THEY’LL BLOCK MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FROM OUSTING SPEAKER JOHNSON

""I don't think it's going to happen this week. I hope it doesn't happen this week"" Gosar told reporters. ""I think it would be nice to see him go back to regular order get things coming from committees you get a majority of the majority to get something on the floor.""

Greene is leading the push to oust Johnson amid conservative frustrations over his bipartisan work on critical legislation related to government funding and foreign aid. She and Massie pledged to force the vote sometime this week.

To do so she would have to notice her resolution as ""privileged"" – meaning the House would have two legislative days to vote on the measure itself or first vote on scuttling it via a procedure known as ""tabling"" the resolution.

Democrats have pledged to block the ouster vote by voting to table the resolution whenever it comes up something that could save Johnson while also likely raising more conservative frustrations.

Johnson told reporters on Monday evening that his meeting with Massie and Greene was ""lengthy"" but ""constructive.""

""We have discussed some ideas and we're going to meet again tomorrow"" Johnson said. ""I just want to say and I told them and I've said this repeatedly that I understand the frustration. I share it. I would really like to advance much more of our conservative policy on a daily basis here. But the reality is we are working with the smallest majority in U.S. history with a one-vote margin."""

For some top ...,"You probably don’t think twice when you swipe your ID badge to get into your office in the morning but your employer might be paying attention.

JPMorgan Chase made headlines in April when Business Insider reported that the financial institution is gathering data from ID badge swipes to ascertain how often employees are coming into the office in accordance with its return-to-office policies. That data is then compiled in reports that managers can use to enforce in-person work quotas. JPMorgan declined to respond to Fortune‘s request for comment.

Four JPMorgan bankers anonymously shared details with Business Insider including screenshots of messages between managing and executive directors at the bank describing a dashboard that denotes how many days employees swiped into the office out of the possible number of eligible days.

In his annual letter to shareholders last month JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said about 10% of employees are permitted to work remotely full time about half must return to the office full time and the remaining 40% can split their time. For that last group Dimon said he and the company’s executives maintain a “general expectation” of three days of in-person work per week.

Like Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon who called remote work an “aberration” Dimon has long bemoaned how virtual meetings squash “spontaneous idea generation” and effective leadership and training. In June 2021 JPMorgan issued a companywide hybrid return-to-office memo. “We want each of you back regularly so that we can test the effectiveness of these models as quickly as possible” he said at the time.

While the dashboards might just be an attempt to understand if return-to-office plans are working some JPMorgan employees are angry that they’re being monitored so closely.

Bankers have taken to Blind an anonymous corporate message board to discuss the issue. In February one post complained “We are treated like children who don’t want to do their homework and need constant monitoring.”

But some of JPMorgan’s employees are resigned to accept the bank’s monitoring practice which is arguably not that dissimilar to when an hourly employee punches a timecard at the beginning and end of a shift.

“Nobody wants to be monitored but … It’s the company’s data and we don’t have a choice” one anonymous JPMorgan source told Business Insider. “People want to be trusted to work from home and be treated as adults. But there’s always a free rider.”

Some are less willing to compromise. Blind is littered with posts from bankers seeking out more remote-friendly jobs largely in the tech industry at giants like Meta Salesforce and Airbnb.

Poor planning

Nicholas Bloom economics professor at Stanford and co-founder of WFH Research thinks the mere existence of these employee monitoring programs shows a real lack of foresight.

“Women people with disabilities and people of color all have a preference for remote work—not only are Goldman and JPMorgan upsetting employees they’ll face issues of diversity if they continue on this” Bloom tells Fortune. “That’s just another cost I don’t think they’re aware of.”

Bloom argues that companies like JPMorgan which are monitoring their unhappy workforce haven’t clearly considered their end goal. Say a worker only comes in two days a week instead of the required three. HR discovers this by tracking swipes and tells the worker’s manager.

“Where does the manager go from there?” Bloom asks.

They have two choices Bloom says: They can ignore it which would make it clear to employees that the rule has no teeth and ultimately makes management look weak. Option two: They start to penalize people and say “I know you perform well and hit your targets but your attendance isn’t good so we’re slashing your pay.”

“Obviously that just pushes high performers out the door to your competitors” Bloom says. “Neither of those choices are appealing so either way you execute I don’t see how it’s a good policy.”

Not for nothing he adds Goldman and JPMorgan are elite organizations. “Everyone there is super ambitious; they’re stars of their class not slackers” he says. “They’d generally do anything to improve their career. In-office mandates being unpopular should show that it’s not important.”

Consider the alternatives

Tracking employees’ office attendance has been commonplace for decades even in white collar work Mark Ein chairman of Kastle Systems a property management and security firm tells Fortune. “Aside from attendance people are trying to figure out what the new world of work will look like and they want to see how workers are utilizing the space.”

Some of Ein’s clients deeply believe the office is important for “getting the most out of a company” he says. “But they have to remember: White collar workers were in the office 60 to 70% of the time pre-COVID anyway. They were on business trips or offsite meetings. One hundred percent attendance doesn’t have to be the goal.”

It’s easy for managers to get stuck on where the work happens “but the most successful hybrid companies shift that focus to how to support the work that happens” Zach Dunn co-founder of Robin a hybrid workplace management platform tells Fortune. “If we think of the office as a tool to use we can start focusing on how to make it as useful as possible for the workers that access it.”

Instead of tracking comings and goings and demanding employees explain why they aren’t coming in Dunn suggests reframing the question to “What work would you prefer doing in the office?”

Insisting on in-office work is at best shortsighted and at worst unproductive Dunn adds. “Employees already know this: Focus on output not ID swipes.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG1lbnRuZXdzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS1uZXdzL25ld3MvZGltb24tcGF5LXNob3VsZC1iZS1yZWplY3RlZC1ieS1qcG1vcmdhbi1pbnZlc3RvcnMtcHJveHktYWR2aXNlci1zYXlzLTIyMTMzNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dimon pay should be rejected by JPMorgan investors proxy adviser says,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. shareholders should vote against Chief Executive Jamie Dimon’s pay package proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis & Co. recommended citing a “disconnect” between his compensation and the bank’s performance.

Of particular concern is $52.6 million in option awards granted to Dimon “nearly double the size of his regular equity grant for 2021” and representing much of his $84.4 million in annual pay Glass Lewis said in a report. The firm also criticized the $53.3 million in total compensation for Daniel Pinto the president and chief operating officer which included almost $27.9 million in option awards.

“Excessive one-off grants to the CEO and COO amid tepid relative performance worsen long-standing concerns regarding the company’s executive-pay program” Glass Lewis said in its report. “Shareholders should consider the company’s sustained disconnect between executive pay and performance over the last nine years.”

The advisory resolution up for a vote by shareholders at the New York-based bank’s annual meeting on May 17 is nonbinding. Glass Lewis and other firms that analyze company disclosures to advise investors how to vote at yearly meetings have come out against a slew of recent high-profile awards. Companies have said the awards are necessary to retain leadership in a heated market for talent.

The options grant given to Dimon is intended to show the board wants him “to continue leading the firm for a significant number of future years” JPMorgan said in response to Glass Lewis’s recommendation. In the case of pay for the company’s president “the board is acting responsibly in shareholders’ best interests in case Mr. Pinto needs to once again serve as CEO as a result of unforeseen circumstances.”

In 2020 the 59-year-old Pinto served as acting co-CEO while Dimon was sidelined by emergency heart surgery just as the coronavirus pandemic roiled markets. Since then Pinto has moved to New York from London to assume the roles of sole president and COO titles he shared with Gordon Smith before Smith’s retirement.

JPMorgan valued the options that make up Dimon’s and Pinto’s special bonuses for accounting purposes but the amount they will ultimately be paid is subject to change based on JPMorgan’s stock price.

The grant to Dimon “incentivizes a successful leadership transition by requiring the CEO’s leadership for at least five years before the awards vest and another five years until he may sell any vested shares” which “ensures direct alignment with shareholder returns over the next decade” JPMorgan said in its response. (The 66-year-old Dimon whenever asked how long he will remain CEO has long joked that he’ll stay for five more years.)

Rival Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs Group Inc. awarded special bonus grants in October to CEO David Solomon and President John Waldron that put them in line for about $50 million in one-time bonuses saying they were intended to guarantee leadership continuity and talent retention. Glass Lewis recommended shareholders vote against their pay package as well.

Institutional Shareholder Services another large proxy-advisory firm also has recommended voting against the pay packages for Dimon and other JPMorgan executives. Compensation for top finance executives including those at JPMorgan and Goldman has lost much of its value with recent market declines. JPMorgan’s share price is down almost 30% since its October high and is below its pre-pandemic levels.

Morgan Tournament of Champions is back in New York’s Grand Central Station for its 24th edition in the iconic location.

“This is the most convenient location in the world” John Nimick the president of Squash Engine and the tournament producer told Sportico. “We use this tournament to promote the sport. Being able to show squash to 20000 people a day is a remarkable opportunity.” Those eyeballs are needed to secure sponsorships but they’re also an important part in the sport’s attempt to court the International Olympic Committee.

“We qualify under the Olympic principles” Nimick said “We qualify in every characteristic of the guidelines for Los Angeles 2028. And we satisfy them like gender parity relevance cost-effectiveness lots of things. But I think the negative for squash is that the IOC officials and the broadcast officials don’t think they’re going to drive the incremental viewership they need to make that impact.”

In that sense the Grand Central matches which take place inside a glass cube that costs $1.5 million to install and remove may not close the deal. The matches take place in one of the most public spaces in New York but there are only 500 assigned seats and the business is built 25% on sponsorship 25% on VIP hospitality packages and 50%ticket sales. A box for the final cost $2800 for four people. “We do very well with private equity firms venture capital firms securities firms banks” Nimick said.

However financiers who live in New York have never been IOC’s target market. The sport is recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) but has never been included in the Olympic Games. The effort to join the 2024 Games were unsuccessful but there is still hope for 2028. “If we make it it would have a material impact on the sport globally” Nimick said.

The J.P. Morgan Tournament is not the only tournament to bring attention to the sport. Squash is played in 185 countries by more than 10 million players. In the U.S. Squash Engine produces the Oracle Netsuite Open in San Francisco’s Embarcadero Plaza and on top of these two prestige tournaments over 200 tournaments take place a year. However the most famous squash tournament takes place thousands of miles away from New York in another iconic location in New Cairo near the pyramids. “That’s the granddaddy of them all” Nimick said. “That tournament was started by the former President Hosni Mubarak who played squash.”

Mobarak is not the only Egyptian interested in the sport. The world’s top players are Egyptian including this year’s favorites Ali Farag and Nouran Gohar and so is the father of this year’s favorite Amanda Sobhy. If Sobhy wins she could be the first American to win the tournament. “The country with the biggest impact in the sport in Egypt” Nimick said.

The Egyptian dominance will be tested on Saturday and the $1.5 million glass box will be dismantled and stored until next year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXJuai5jb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZS9sb2NhbC1ub24tcHJvZml0cy1yZWFjaC1odW5kcmVkcy1vZi1uZXdhcmstc3R1ZGVudHMtd2l0aC1jYXJlZXItcGFuZWxzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Local non-profits reach hundreds of Newark students with career panels,"Local non-profits reach hundreds of Newark students with career panels



FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

NEWARK – United Community Corporation and the Arman Roy Foundation teamed up to host two career panels at Newark High Schools this April.

The panels focused on careers in the technology and STEM fields and the impact of technology in careers beyond just the traditional tech jobs.

The panels reached an estimated 200 students between sessions at Payne Tech on April 13 and East Side High School on April 29.

Eight professionals participated in the panelists from various organizations: Bre’yanie Pearson and Misba Gani Per Scholas; Melissa Prashad JPMorgan Chase; Kendall L. Givens NPower; Christopher Mainor Urban Pathways; John Samuel TEA-Corp; and Christian Agkpo Montclair Learning Center.

Essex County Schools of Technology Supervisor of Student-Related Services Patricia Shaffer facilitated the panel at Payne Tech and Newark East Side Vice Principal Michael West organized the panel at his school.

“These types of events are so critical because they expose our students to experiences and opportunities that are out there” West said. “What better opportunity for students to have than seeing and interacting with professionals in the field as they are learning and thinking about what their future might be.”

The experiences of the panelists varied significantly. Some took the college route some achieved Master’s Degrees while others pursued Associate’s Degrees. Some didn’t go to college at all. Others like JPMorgan Chase Community Manager and United Community Corporation Board Secretary Melissa Prashad were first-generation college students.

“I thought that I could add inspiration to this panel” Prashad said. “A lot of my storytelling about my past is to share that anything is possible. In one generation everything can change. You have to be driven. Whether it is tech banking or anything in life you have to work hard and follow your heart.”

Each tech panel lasted 45 minutes in a Q&A format which was moderated by UCC Director of Community Engagement Richard Greco and Arman Roy Foundation Founder & Chairperson Manisha Roy. Students were able to jump in and ask questions along with moderates and utilzied an allotted time at the panel’s conclusion to network with the professionals and ask any additional questions in a one-on-one setting.

“When you are in high school it’s such an exciting time because there are so many opportunities in front of you but it could also be very stressful” Roy said. “We saw through the 200 students that we met over the last few weeks that most of them don’t know what their journey is going to look like. These types of opportunities and panels that bring together professionals from a wide array of industries are so important because each panelist took a different route to get to where they are.”

One of those potential routes for students includes going directly into a training program following graduation. The tech panel featured two organizations that offer free training to low-income young adults.

Per Scholas provides skill training and access to employer networks to individuals often excluded from tech careers. It focuses on diversifying the technology workforce by offering no-cost technical training. Per Scholas’ Newark Campus is located at 12 Lombardy Street.

NPower creates pathways to economic prosperity by launching digital careers for military veterans and young adults in underserved communities with a focus on technology and digital skills. NPower’s Newark Campus is located at 33 Washington Street.

“I think that a lot of people in underserved communities feel that their only way out of poverty is through scholarships and sports or going into massive debt” NPower Professional Development Manager Kendall L. Givens said. “There are other ways to successfully enter different careers. Panels like this are extremely important because students don’t always know about programs that are available to help them.”

While the panel focused on the impact of technology in the workforce. It also allowed Greco and Roy to share information about their non-profit agencies and how students and their families can benefit from them. United Community Corporation is the Community Action Agency of Newark and offers a wide array of services ranging from food assistance to shelter to COVID-19 vaccination outreach to youth family and senior services. The Arman Roy Foundation is inspired by the life of Arman Roy and follows his mission of changing the lives of vulnerable youth by opening a window to wonder opportunity and hope through technology.

“Having the opportunity to not only educate these young people about their future but also share some services that can benefit them and their families was great” Greco said. “The fact that we provided this service directly to students in their schools made a huge difference. We can’t thank East Side and Payne Tech enough for allowing us the time to speak with their students.”

Invest $101000 in These Ultra-High-Yield Energy Stocks,"These passive income powerhouses sport an average yield of 7.45%!

While there are a number of moneymaking investing strategies buying dividend stocks just might be the best.

Back in 2013 J.P. Morgan Asset Management a division of money-center bank JPMorgan Chase issued a report comparing the performance of companies that initiated and grew their payouts to publicly traded companies that didn't pay a dividend. Over a 40-year stretch (1972-2012) the dividend stocks mopped the floor with the non-dividend payers: 9.5% annualized return vs. 1.6% annualized return.

Because income stocks are often profitable and time-tested they're just the types of businesses we'd expect to increase in value over time. In other words it's not a matter of if dividend stocks can make you money -- it's determining which dividend stocks to buy.

If steady annual dividend income that can put inflation in its place is what you're after ultra-high-yield energy stocks could be your answer. The following three passive income juggernauts average a 7.45% yield which means you can generate $7500 in annual income by investing roughly $101000 (split equally).

Enterprise Products Partners: 6.9% yield

The first energy powerhouse that can help investors rake in the cash while taming historically high inflation is oil and gas stock Enterprise Products Partners (EPD -0.07%). Though its 6.9% yield is the low-water mark on this list the company has raised its base annual payout in each of the past 23 years.

For some investors the idea of putting their money to work in oil stocks may not be appealing. Just 25 months ago the energy sector was in a state of shock as the COVID-19 pandemic led to global lockdowns and a cratering in crude oil demand. In fact West Texas Intermediate futures briefly hit negative $40 a barrel.

But EPD (I'm referring to Enterprise Products Partners' ticker symbol here as an abbreviation for the company) is an entirely different beast. Whereas drillers and explorers were pummeled by the historic demand drawdown EPD was fine. That's because it's an integrated midstream company. In plainer terms it's an energy middleman. It controls more than 50000 miles of transmission pipeline has 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage capacity operates 23 natural gas processing facilities and manages 19 deepwater docks handling natural gas liquids.

The beauty of the midstream operating model is very simple: it's predictable. Utilizing volume-based commitments from drillers EPD is able to forecast its annual cash flow with incredible accuracy. This is important as it allows the company to outlay capital for new infrastructure as well as make acquisitions. EPD currently has 10 major infrastructure projects under construction totaling $4.6 billion. All but two of these projects will be fully operational within the next 20 months.

If you need even more convincing consider this: At no point during the pandemic did Enterprise Products Partners' distribution coverage ratio fall below 1.6. The ""distribution coverage ratio"" describes the amount of distributable cash flow from operations relative to what was paid to shareholders. A figure below 1 would imply an unsustainable payout. With EPD nowhere near this danger zone and oil and gas prices now soaring it's safe to say this supercharged payout is rock-solid.

Alliance Resource Partners: 7.14% yield

A second ultra-high-yield energy stock that can help income seekers generate $7500 in annual payouts is coal producer Alliance Resource Partners (ARLP -2.35%). Following its recent 40% quarterly dividend hike Alliance Resource Partners is parsing out a 7.1% yield.

As recently as the fourth quarter of 2020 coal stocks were a dumpster fire -- and that's putting it nicely. Between July 2018 and August 2020 coal price per ton plummeted almost 60%. Weakened demand from COVID-19 coupled with supply chain challenges and labor shortages proved to be a perfect storm for much of the industry. At one point even Alliance Resource Partners was forced to shelve its dividend due to economic uncertainty.

But that's all a distant memory. Historically high commodity inflation has sent the per-ton coal price up 600% since August 2020 (and that's after a modest pullback). With management expecting high inflation and robust coal prices to persist throughout 2022 the company aims to increase its distribution by 10% to 15% per quarter for the remainder of the year. If its share price were to stay the same income investors would be looking at a yield of around 10% or possibly higher.

What makes Alliance Resource Partners tick is its forward-thinking management team. Well over 90% of 2022's estimated coal production is already spoken for via volume and price commitments. Further around 55% of next year's output if similar to 2022 is locked in. During the first quarter the company booked commitments all the way out to 2025. Similar to EPD this is a way for Alliance Resource Partners to maintain a transparent outlook for its operating cash flow.

In addition to its coal operations the company also has oil and gas royalty interests. Without getting too deep into the weeds the higher oil and natural gas prices head the likelier it is that Alliance Resource Partners will recognize more adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) from this royalty segment. During the first quarter the company's adjusted EBITDA from its oil and gas segment rose 139% from the prior-year period.

After years of underperformance things couldn't be any better for Alliance Resource Partners.

Antero Midstream: 8.31% yield

The third ultra-high-yield energy stock that can bring in the green and crush inflation is midstream natural gas operator Antero Midstream (AM 0.49%). Among the three stocks listed here Antero's 8.31% yield is the highest.

Similar to EPD Antero Midstream benefits from the predictability of the contracts it signs with parent company Antero Resources (AR 0.03%). The former provides gathering compressing processing and water delivery for the latter. Knowing well in advance how much operating cash flow the company can expect in a given year allows Antero Midstream to outlay capital for new infrastructure projects without compromising its profitability or distribution.

Interestingly Antero Midstream slashed its quarterly distribution by 27% last year. I say ""interestingly"" because the price for natural gas had improved significantly from the previous year and the company had no trouble covering its distribution. However there's a very good reason for this reduction.

Parent company Antero Resources plans to increase its drilling on Antero Midstream's acreage. The latter purposefully reduced its dividend to shift additional capital to new infrastructure projects through the midpoint of the decade. In announcing the move Antero Midstream estimated that it would generate $400 million in incremental free cash flow by 2025. The company is effectively trading a small amount of near-term distributions to generate significantly more operating cash flow over the long run.

One reason to make this move is that it'll likely help push Antero Midstream's share price higher. Even though I'm pounding the table on the yields for these passive income juggernauts their valuations can easily expand over time. But the other impetus behind this move is to shore up the company's balance sheet. Antero Midstream has reduced its net debt by over $1.6 billion since the end of 2019 and will likely end 2022 with a leverage ratio below 1.

While you're not going to get the dividend hike potential with Antero Midstream that you have with EPD and Alliance Resource Partners this company still packs a punch for income investors."

Springfield's ""cheese caves"" aren't natural caves like Fantastic Caverns or Crystal Cave. Rather the ""caves"" are part of a 3.2-million-square-foot warehouse under part of Springfield. Dairy products including cheese make up only a portion of the leasable space known as Springfield Underground.

The underground warehouse which opened in 1946 as a limestone quarry is home to 50 different companies employs 600 workers and sees 600 trucks per day Erlen Group President and CEO John Griesmer said. Erlen Group is a collective of industrial companies that includes Springfield Underground.

The warehouse's address is 3610 E. Kearney St. but is extends under Highway 65 to the west Le Compte Road to the east and as far south as Division Street. It's directly accessible to Interstate 44 and Highway 65.

More:Answer Man: Exactly where underground is Springfield Underground located?

The natural temperature of the warehouse is about 60 degrees making it energy efficient. Leasers may request refrigeration ranging from -20 to 55 degrees Fahrenheit Griesmer said. This makes the warehouse ideal for storing food products including cheese.

What is stored in Springfield's 'cheese caves'?

Due to privacy agreements with individual businesses Springfield Underground is unable to comment on which companies they house Griesmer said. The News-Leader contacted regional dairy companies about their potential business with the warehouse.

Kraft Heinz

Many of the social media rumors single out Kraft Heinz as a company storing cheese in the ""caves."" U.S. Communications Brand PR and Media Director Jenna Thornton confirmed that Kraft does utilize the Springfield Underground warehouse.

""We do indeed age cheese here and have been for many years"" Thornton said. ""It’s not a surplus but it’s essentially a warehousing location that’s close to our Springfield plant.""

The Springfield Kraft Foods manufacturing plant is located at 1951 E. Meadowmere St.

Thornton did not respond to an interview request from the News-Leader seeking more information on Kraft's utilization of Springfield Underground.

Dairy Farmers of America

Kraft is not the only dairy company storing products at Springfield Underground. Dairy Farmers of America has stored dry dairy ingredients in the warehouse for about 30 years. DFA's Springfield manufacturing plant is at 800 W. Tampa St.

Specifically DFA stores milk cheese and nutritional powders and nonfat dried milk President of Ingredient Solutions Martin Bates said. As of February DFA was storing about 7 million pounds of raw material at Springfield Underground.

These raw materials are made at the Springfield plant stored in Springfield Underground and then sold to other food companies.

Bates said most of the raw materials have a shelf life more than two years but he described storing products at Springfield Underground as a ""buffer"" in the supply chain system. DFA tries not to keep too much inventory in storage for long.

Bates said the location of Springfield Underground and its ambient temperature are key factors as to why DFA uses the space. Underground storage protects products from natural disasters like tornadoes. And the consistent temperature is ideal for the dry ingredients.

The News-Leader reached out to Prairie Farms Dairy associated with Hiland Dairy. The company did not wish to participate in an interview. Hiland Dairy is also associated with DFA.

Why are dairy companies storing cheese underground?

According to Kraft and DFA's sources the companies utilize Springfield Underground as a space to age cheese and temporarily store dry products.

Utilizing cold storage similar to Springfield Underground is popular with dairy companies across the country.

As of March 31 more than 1.4 billion pounds of natural cheese was stored in cold storage warehouses in the United States according to the United States Department of Agriculture.

While checking out the ""Springfield cheese caves"" is off limits as company warehouses are privately owned visiting Springfield Underground itself is not. In the past Springfield Underground has hosted grade school field trips and public events like the Caveman 5K in 2014. For more information contact Springfield Underground at 417-874-1400.

The community rallied for support across the country to win $250000 for arena upgrades $10000 worth of youth hockey equipment from the NHLPA’s Goals & Dreams fund and the opportunity to host an NHL® preseason game.

TORONTO ON (May 7 2022) – The votes are in! Kraft Heinz Canada in partnership with the National Hockey League (NHL) and the National Hockey League Players’ Association (NHLPA) is pleased to announce Sydney Nova Scotia has won the coveted title of Kraft Hockeyville 2022.

Canadians from coast-to-coast cast their votes for Sydney rewarding the community for its unwavering passion for hockey and their desire to make the game more inclusive and accessible for all. The Canada Games Complex is a connection point for the community and is where the heart of hockey lives in Sydney. The official announcement was made by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman on Sportsnet’s Hockey Night in Canada broadcast earlier tonight.

The celebration begins for Sydney! Cape Breton is a small island with a huge passion for hockey. Locals describe the island the way they describe their love for community hockey: fierce resolute and resilient. The Canada Games Complex in Sydney was built 35 years ago to host the 1987 Canada Winter Games but has since had to close its doors to hockey. Since then the demand for rink access on the island has outweighed the supply making it difficult to accommodate the sharp increase in participation in girls’ hockey the community has seen over the last number of years. Winning Kraft Hockeyville will help the community purchase the new compressor it needs to reopen its arena’s doors and empower the girls on the island itching for ice time.

Sydney will receive $250000 for upgrades to Canada Games Complex an opportunity to host an NHL® preseason game and $10000 worth of youth hockey equipment from the NHLPA’s Goals & Dreams fund. The remaining community finalists will be awarded $25000 each for arena upgrades along with $10000 worth of youth hockey equipment from the NHLPA’s Goals & Dreams fund.

The announcement officially brings another year of Kraft Hockeyville to a close after millions of votes from across Canada were tallied truly demonstrating how hockey continues to be such an important part of what makes Canadian communities unique and special. Sydney and other nominated communities have made a clear commitment to the game and even more to making hockey accessible and inclusive for generations to come.



“Kraft Hockeyville exists to celebrate the connected communities that hockey’s created and support them with investments in infrastructure and a drive to make the game more accessible and inclusive for all” said Adam Butler President Kraft Heinz Canada. “We would like to extend our congratulations to Sydney and all of this year’s finalists for their passion for the program and commitment to hockey in their community.”

April had stopped off at Wawa this weekend and spotted this new coffee and after a quick text the order was in for mine which she brought home. Usually as of late my go-to at Wawa is their ""Cuban"" blend which is a dark roast. This new coffee she found is a medium roast.

Wawa is known throughout New Jersey and their coffee is a huge fan favorite. When we have asked you at home you tell us one of your favorite items at Wawa is their coffee and I agree it's very good ""real"" coffee.

Wawa has its own ""regular"" blend and decaf. Along with french vanilla and hazelnut all of these four are ""mild"". Their Columbian blend is their ""medium"" style. Their Cuban blend and dark roast are their ""dark"" blends.

All business sectors head into the end of the week horribly down

The Fed’s rate hike has had a massive effect on financials across the globe

In another procedure meeting Nicholas Merten gives his 516000 YouTube endorsers a week after week wrap-up after the Federal Reserve raised loan costs and advanced resources shriveled under significant sell-side tension.

I need to feel free to talk a smidgen about what we discussed as our most dire outcome imaginable. I must be straightforward with you folks I will stay consistent here in the future.

Perhaps I’m off-base twice straight yet I will be positive about my articulation here as in while we could expect some further decrease in value there is a breaking point an edge where it really seems OK by the day’s end to see cost truly go down until we begin to see individuals limit purchasing and furthermore driving the charge available request stream which will drive cost back up.

Crypto outlook

The Data Dash have proceeds to express that while he can’t pinpoint the specific date or what amount of time the interaction will require his goal is to give a sensible BTC valuation range so watchers could dollar at any point cost normal (DCA) while building their positions.

He recognizes the total market cap of Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) as tumbling to sub-$900 billion though that figure right now remains at $1.1 trillion.

Merten finishes up by contrasting past cycle tops and remedies with show that even after huge drops BTC never really fell as low as the first cycle’s pinnacle. This is My desired highlight bring here meanwhile we could come near it we could come here toward $30000.

I believe it’s totally superfluous and not feasible to feel that we’d descend and contact $20000. At the time of composing Bitcoin is down 1.22% as of now evaluated at $36036. BTC stays down 9.6% from its week by week high of $39874 on Wednesday.

Bitcoin’s cost tumbled down to $35500 Friday deleting Wednesday’s 6% addition after the Federal Reserve reported it would battle expansion without bigger rate climbs.

Prices plunge further

Therefore you ought to have a bullish and negative arrangement in light of the fact that the business sectors can switch really quick. As per crypto market specialists Bitcoin has been exchanging a tight reach for half a month at this point basically floating somewhere in the range of $36000 and $42000.

The expanded market instability can be credited to rising expansion international emergencies and worry over more tight money related strategy by the Fed.

The Fed conveyed the first-rate climb in quite a while Wednesday and flagged more rate increments are suitable and the accounting report spillover will start in June. The Fed is hustling to battle expansion which rose to 8.5% in March as per the most recent expansion report.

The last time Bitcoin had been stuck beneath $40000 was toward the beginning of March until it hopped in cost by 10% to above $42000 following President Joe Biden’s marking of a general leader request on digital currency.

""He was blessed with all but years..""

It is with deep sadness that we announce the death of George Ferris Kroeger Jr.

George passed away unexpectedly in his sleep on April 20th 2022 while visiting his beloved family in St. Louis. He was born in Paradise Valley Arizona on June 18th 2003 and was just shy of his 19th birthday.

George was an individual who transcended his age. He was referred to as an 'old soul' from the time he was very young. To the many who knew and loved him as a child he was affectionately called 'Baby George'. Soft-spoken and reserved in nature George was exceptionally intelligent with a fantastically dry sense of humor. He traveled far and wide for a young man. Some of his happiest moments were exploring London Oyster card in hand running around on the Tube but arguably some of his most content days were spent close to home with friends and family at Forest Highlands in Flagstaff Arizona.

He attended Christ Church Pre-School where he made many friends with whom he remained in contact with his entire life. He went to grade school at The Phoenix Country Day School and later St. Thomas the Apostle from which he graduated. To his grade school friends he was simply 'Kroego'.

In 2018 he entered high school at Brophy College Preparatory in the Honors Program where he re-connected with friends from pre-school grade schools and sports. George's life came together for him as his passion for school rowing and above all friends converged. He had many hobbies he pursued from sailing to skiing to tennis but the one common thread was that he approached them all as he did life: with an overwhelming sense of zeal. Academics were a strong suit for George and he was extremely fond of many of his teachers and mentors at Brophy who helped him navigate his teenage years. They engaged him in course work but also extracurricular pursuits such as the Stock Club and perhaps most importantly took great interest in developing him into a 'man for others' through hours of volunteer work abroad and in the community.

George was a few weeks away from graduating from high school and had just solidified his plans to shadow medical professionals this summer and fall in Tanzania to explore his passion for medicine. For those he helped with his intuitive medical knowledge he was affectionately ""Dr. George."" With much anticipation he was planning a Spring Start at SMU in 2023 in the Biology (major) and Health Sciences (minor) Department to pursue his dream of finding better treatments for mental health disorders.

George is preceded in death by his maternal grandmother Sophie Lee. He is survived by an extended family who cherished him: his mother Nicole Lee Roberts adoring sister Sophie Kroeger with whom he was especially close stepfather Thomas Roberts and grandfather John Lee of St. Louis. He had many adoring aunts and supportive uncles: Cynthia Lee and Mike Latta of St. Louis and Terri and John Lee of Ft. Worth in addition to his many loving step-aunts and uncles in the Roberts family. His cousins Graves Gladney Madeline and Caroline Lee and Grace Kaelyn and Rocksy Kroeger will always carry George in their hearts. His step siblings Brittney and Evan Boff Cameron and Elyse Flint Michael Roberts Ashton and Carter Sidi and half-brother Wyatt survive him. Grandparents Hal A. Kroeger of St. Louis and Carole Kroeger of West Palm Beach Father George Kroeger Sr. and his aunt and uncle Heather and Rockwell Kroeger of Aspen all survive him.

George's family is beyond grateful for the outpouring of prayers and kind thoughts. Should anyone want to make a tribute to George a memorial may be sent to the GFK Jr. Medical Scholarship Fund www.gfkjrmedicalstudentfund.org

The goal of the Fund will be to fulfill George's dream of developing better treatments for mental health disorders through scholarships for other prospective students.

Donations may also be sent to The Arizona Humane Society to carry on George's love of all animals especially dogs. https://www.azhumane.org/memorial-and-tribute-gifts/

Funeral Services will be held at 6:00 pm on Saturday May 7 2022 at The Franciscan Renewal Center. 'The Casa' is located at 5802 E. Lincoln Dr. Paradise Valley AZ 85253.

After posting a heartbreaking message to social media Arlana Miller a 19-year-old freshman at Southern University and A&M College in Louisiana passed away this week. Screenshots of Miller’s troubling Instagram post which was quickly taken down following the tragic news appeared to show the young teen expressing frustration about the struggles she endured over the last year from contracting COVID-19 to “failing all” of her classes.

News reports indicate she was an agriculture major and was a member of the HBCU’s cheerleading team. In a statement Southern University’s athletic department said that Miller passed away shortly after posting the tragic letter on Thursday.

“On May 4 2022 at approximately 9 PM Southern University Athletic Department was notified of a social media post which ultimately led to this unfortunate announcement” the statement read.

Counseling will be available to students on campus. According to the school students can reach counselors at 225-771-2480 or email at counselingcenter@subr.edu. The 24/7 CRISIS partner can be reached at 225-368-9602.

Noting that May is Mental Health Awareness Month the athletic department said this was “a time to raise awareness of mental or behavioral health issues and help reduce the stigma so many experiences.” In a proclamation officially recognizing the month the White House pointed to the disparities in mental health treatment with many Americans never getting treatment.

The pandemic has taken an emotional toll on teens and young adults. According to a scientific brief published by the World Health Organization in March during the first year of the pandemic cases of anxiety and depression skyrocketed by 25 percent putting young Americans disproportionally at risk of suicidal and self-harming behaviors. The data suggests that the mental health crisis may have been exacerbated due to severe disruptions in mental health care services at the height of the pandemic leaving a wide gap open for individuals in need of care.

“For much of the pandemic services for mental neurological and substance use conditions were the most disrupted among all essential health services reported” the WHO reported. Some of those disruptions drastically affected life-saving services for suicide prevention.

A 2021 survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that nearly 63 percent of 18 to 24-year-olds had symptoms of anxiety and depression during the pandemic with 25 percent of respondents reporting that they had considered suicide last year. The survey found that another 25 percent reported increased substance use to deal with the stress and anxiety brought on by the pandemic.

Baby formula is becoming hard to come by all across the country as grocery stores like Walmart and Kroger continue to restrict the amount that people can buy at once. Grocery stores like Costco however continue to offer the products in bulk supply at a low price.

At stores across the U.S. 40% of top-selling baby formulas were out of stock the week of April 24 a new analysis from Datasembly shows. The firm tracked baby formula stock at more than 11000 stores. National out-of-stock levels increased from 31% to 40% between April 3 and April 24.

""This is a shocking number that you don't see for other categories"" Ben Reich CEO of Datasembly told CBS MoneyWatch.

The supply of baby formula was already constrained due to a national recall on a variety of Abbott Nutrition products earlier this year.

Prices of baby formula have also spiked—which is concerning to many families and caregivers since about three-quarters of babies in the U.S. drink formula within their first six months of life. The average cost of formula is now up as much as 18% over the past year.

The Infant Nutrition Council of America recently issued a statement on its website assuring parents that manufacturers are increasing production to meet families' needs. The council also encouraged parents to keep a two-week supply of formula at home and not hoard products.

In January Enfamil a leading baby formula brand said it was coping with an unprecedented 18% surge in demand for baby formula nationwide.

""We have taken steps to ramp up production and are currently shipping 50% more product to address issues as fast as possible"" a spokesperson for Reckitt maker of Enfamil told CBS News in a statement at the time.

If families are in emergency situations local food pantries churches shelters and hospital emergency rooms may be able to provide a small amount of formula based on need. Additionally families can contact Feeding America or dial 2-1-1 to be connected to a community resource specialist who can connect them to local resources.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

When Carrie Lam became Hong Kong’s chief executive in 2017 she promised to heal a society divided by the Umbrella Protests of three years before. But as her term comes to an end and former policeman and security chief John Lee takes the reins the Chinese-controlled territory appears more fractured than ever.

The freest city in Asia that attracted international finance news outlets artists civil society and even welcomed foreign judges to its bench is now looking more and more like mainland China.

After years of growth Hong Kong’s population has shrunk at a record pace over the last two years fuelled by the political crackdown as well as the harsh but ineffective measures to contain COVID-19.

Lam leaves office with a net approval rating of 33.4 percent according to an April survey by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute while just 16 percent of people report satisfaction with the current political situation and nine percent with the economy.

Hong Kong’s downward slide – and Lam’s probable legacy – can be traced to one key event in 2019 when she attempted to change the city’s extradition laws. The plan would have allowed residents to be extradited to China to stand trial where defendants face a 99 percent conviction rate in criminal cases. At the time Lam said the plan would close “loopholes” in the city’s extradition law. Instead she set off Hong Kong’s largest ever protests.

Millions marched against the proposals but with Lam’s government failing to respond and police using more heavy-handed tactics the movement began to call for democratic reform. Confrontations between protesters and police increased culminating in the prolonged siege of the Polytechnic University in November 2019.

The pandemic – and the restrictive laws imposed to control even the tiniest outbreak – put paid to the protests in 2020 but later that year Beijing imposed the broadly worded National Security Law which it said was necessary to deal with issues such as “terrorism” and “collusion with foreign powers” but effectively silenced any form of criticism.

Backsliding or inevitable?

When China took back Hong Kong from the British in 1997 it committed to what it called “one country two systems” a framework under which the territory would be able to maintain its way of life and freedoms for at least 50 years.

While Hong Kong had already changed a great deal when Lam took over as chief executive observers say its slide over the past two years was not inevitable.

Before the 2019 protests Chinese President Xi Jinping had made clear he had big plans for Hong Kong. He wanted to integrate the city into the “Greater Bay Area” southern China megalopolis but had not yet pushed for major changes said Steve Tsang director of the SOAS China Institute in London.

Xi only acted when he saw what he considered an “open rebellion” under way in Hong Kong.

“The protests would not have happened without Lam rushing through the extradition bill and did so very badly” Tsang said by email. “Many if not most of the changes in [Hong Kong] since 2020 would come but they would not have been introduced and imposed the way they have been without Lam’s particularly poor management of policies” like the extradition bill.

Lokman Tsui an activist and fellow at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab agrees.

“If you look back I think the critical moment was the extradition bill and that was not inevitable at all. It was hubris by the Hong Kong government by Carrie Lam that got us where we are now” he told Al Jazeera. “The extradition bill wasn’t something apparently that Beijing was pushing but that Carrie Lam was trying to push on her own initiative because she wanted to do well with Beijing.”

Even in the early days of the protests when first one and then two million took to the streets on consecutive weekends Tsui said the chief executive still could have taken a different path – as her predecessors had done in the face of public opposition.

In 2003 after a protest by 500000 Hong Kongers the government shelved then-plans for national security legislation. The government also backed away from a 2012 plan to add pro-China “moral and national education” classes to school curriculums after students and parents protested.

Lam may have hoped the anti-extradition protests would go the way of the Umbrella Movement. In 2014 thousands of protesters had made global headlines as they occupied Hong Kong island’s Central business district to demand universal suffrage but despite a strong start the protests eventually fizzled out.

What Lam failed to recognise – like many Hong Kong leaders before her – was that each time protesters had returned home in the past their discontent had not gone away said Citizen Lab’s Tsui. Instead the feeling metastasized he said as Hong Kongers saw a growing disconnect between their interests and that of the Beijing-approved government.

“What the lesson of history teaches you basically trade in temporary compliance – people seem to be complying or being obedient – but you lose trust you lose good faith in government and so on” Tsui said.

Reading the tea leaves

As a career civil servant who was appointed to her posts observers say that the odds were always stacked against Lam.

She was also placed in the “impossible” job faced by all chief executives of serving both Beijing and Hong Kong she also lacked important political skills typically gleaned by leaders in democracies over multiple election cycles.

Much of this came from the “founding contradiction of Hong Kong” said Ben Bland author of Generation HK and director of the Southeast Asia programme at the Lowy Institute in Australia whereby Hong Kong could not be both a democratic city and part of the world’s largest authoritarian state.

In the years leading up to the 2019 protests “forces were bubbling up” as Hong Kongers and the Chinese government became increasingly frustrated with each other he said.

Missing these signs Lam failed to appreciate that a wave of Hong Kong nationalism had begun spreading through the younger generation in the years after the Umbrella Movement. Many began to appreciate their city’s unique cultural and political heritage while more radical Hong Kongers wanted to push for more autonomy and even independence.

Grievance-specific protests also began to evolve into protests rallying against the entire political system said Michael C Davis a global fellow at the Wilson Center in the United States as protesters began to link issues-based problems with their lack of representation in government.

“It’s always the street guarding Hong Kong’s autonomy and not these public officials. [Chief Executives] Tung Chee-hwa Donald Tsang and Leung Chun-ying are all guilty of this” said Davis. “In some ways Carrie Lam seems to be the most egregious player in this regard pushing things through over public objection consistently. The impression then left was that she basically was taking instructions from Beijing.”

Bland also said during that time many Hong Kong officials seemed to be “clueless” in 2019 as to why protesters were on the streets he said and what could be done to reconcile with them.

“They just didn’t want to see what was happening on the ground” he told Al Jazeera. “Officials in the mainland they tend to view protesters as ‘Oh they’re just spoiled children’ and there was that public narrative. I think they ended up believing things they said publicly which was a big problem.”

But Lam not only alienated the protest-going public said Anna Kwok the strategy and campaign director at the Hong Kong Democracy Council in the US.

“The 2019 movement and the way [Lam] handled it raised a lot of questions from the Beijing government and even the pro-Beijing camp in Hong Kong” she said as many feared they could lose their seats in the then-semi democratic local elections.

The protests also put Hong Kong and Beijing in the spotlight as local and international media covered the events in minute detail for months.

Despite widespread public criticism Lam has always maintained publicly that she was only ever trying to “fix legal loopholes” with her bill and has complained about the difficulty the protests wreaked on her personal life unable among other things to use banking services after the US sanctioned her.

In private a leaked audio recording in 2019 revealed that she would have preferred to quit than serve out her term as chief executive.

After Sunday she will finally get her chance to rest.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vaG9uZ2tvbmdmcC5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8wNy9ob25nLWtvbmctbW9yZS11bmVxdWFsLWxlc3MtZnJlZS1hcy1jYXJyaWUtbGFtLWxlYXZlcy1vZmZpY2UlRUYlQkYlQkMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hong Kong more unequal less free as Carrie Lam leaves office,"By Holmes Chan

Hong Kong has emerged a more unequal city its freedoms curtailed and international shine dulled after five years with Carrie Lam at the helm analysts say as her turbulent leadership draws to an end.

Lam Hong Kong’s first woman leader took office promising to heal divisions and tackle livelihood issues especially a housing crisis.

Her term was instead dominated by massive democracy protests and Beijing’s subsequent crackdown as well as a zero-Covid pandemic strategy that kept the city isolated while rivals reopened.

She is on track to depart at the end of June with the lowest approval ratings of any leader since the handover from Britain.

In her final policy address last October Lam described Hong Kong as “much stronger than ever” after China intervened to ensure stability.

Her government survived the mass protest movement but many say she failed to deliver on life improvement pledges — which even China’s leadership says are at the heart of the city’s “deep-rooted social conflicts.”

Last year 1.65 million Hong Kongers — nearly one in four — were living below the government’s official poverty line which for a one-person household means HK$4400 ($560) a month.

This was the highest level since records began 12 years ago.

“The grassroots have been very neglected” said Sze Lai-shan deputy director of the Society for Community Organization.

“Sometimes it feels like (the government) is living on a different planet.”

Even pro-establishment figures have been unimpressed.

“You may say (Lam) has been working very hard but little has been achieved in solving the deteriorating livelihood issues and Hong Kong’s deep-rooted conflicts” senior Beijing advisor Lau Siu-kai told AFP.

World’s most expensive property

Last July China’s top official on Hong Kong affairs Xia Baolong gave a speech widely seen as a reflection of Beijing’s growing impatience with the housing crisis something every leader since the 1997 handover has failed to solve.

The city Xia said must “say goodbye” to cage homes and the tiny shared apartment rooms where some 220000 Hong Kongers still dwell.

Hong Kong has long held the title of the world’s most unaffordable housing market where a study this year showed the median property price is 23 times the median household income.

Lam increased public housing supply more than her predecessors but demand still outstripped supply with the wait time increasing to six years.

“By putting home ownership as the goal it exacerbated the wealth inequality in society” Chan told AFP.

“(Lam’s) policies do not target those in the greatest need. There is a mismatch.”

Exodus

The last two years of Lam’s term also witnessed a historic outflow of people — fleeing either the political crackdown or some of the world’s strictest pandemic controls.

The departures surged further this year when Hong Kong’s zero-Covid policy collapsed as the more transmissible Omicron variant broke through killing more than 9000 people mostly under-vaccinated elderly.

A net 160000 people departed Hong Kong in the first three months of the year.

Lam recently acknowledged that the curbs had caused a brain drain among foreign businesses saying it was an “undeniable fact”.

Meanwhile Beijing’s ongoing efforts to reshape Hong Kong’s political landscape sparked another emigration wave among locals.

After the 2019 protests were crushed China imposed a sweeping national security law that criminalised dissent and transformed the once outspoken city.

Police arrested 182 people under the security law. Most of the city’s prominent democracy activists are either in jail or have fled overseas.

In the annual international press freedom chart released this week by Reporters Without Borders Hong Kong plummeted from 80th to 148th place.

Frances Hui an activist granted asylum in the United States described Lam as an “obedient enforcer” of Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s agenda.

“She accelerated the suppression of freedoms” Hui told AFP.

The Hong Kong diaspora is steadily growing in places like Britain Canada and the United States.

“I didn’t expect that taking part in activism will lead to me having to seek asylum” Hui said.

“That’s a reflection of how far Hong Kong has fallen.”

Arnold Stalk built a reputation over a decade for his charismatic appeals to help the homeless and low-income veterans in Las Vegas.

But allegations of poor upkeep at his first housing complex where tenants complained of substandard conditions despite millions poured into it have brought scrutiny to his nonprofit SHARE Village. SHARE abandoned management at the flagship property in September resulting in a lawsuit. Stalk then listed three other complexes for sale raising more concerns about the charity’s stability and obligation to vulnerable populations.

Once called Veterans Village Stalk’s operations are funded through public and private donations and rent. The city of Las Vegas alone awarded him $2 million in taxpayer-funded loans for building purchase and renovation.

But tenants at the flagship property have told the Review-Journal that they endured living in rooms with cockroaches leaking pipes and stained mattresses.

“It’s just grotesque” said one resident 71-year-old Bobbye Sexton. “This is supposed to be a trusted man for humanity.”

In response to tenant allegations SHARE attorney David LeGrand said in a statement the property passed federal housing inspections for 11 years and that necessary repairs were made as effectively and efficiently as possible.

Stalk claimed in an email to a county official in September that he “procured millions of dollars into improvements for the facility” — a 123-unit apartment building in downtown Las Vegas — but LeGrand declined to provide documentation of renovations made calling the matter irrelevant.

He also said the nonprofit that took over property management Caridad signed a lease in November and accepted the building as being in “good order” and “satisfactory condition.”

During an interview Stalk said he was proud of his efforts to turn former rundown motels into low-income housing. At its zenith SHARE operated six properties totaling more than 500 units.

“We’re not a shelter; we’re the solution” Stalk said. “We can have 10 SHARE Villages and it’s not going to be enough to meet the demand.”

In September SHARE abandoned operations at its first complex during the middle of its lease. Residents were left unsure whether they would remain housed and scrambled to collect their security deposits for months. The building’s owner YSBM Investment LLC sued SHARE alleging it owed them unpaid rent and taxes.

“I’ve never abandoned anybody in my life especially a United States veteran a homeless family are you kidding me?” said Stalk who gave two weeks’ written notice to the owner and a week’s notice to tenants. “I’m at peace with how we handled our affairs.”

However SHARE’s operations have diminished leaving some community leaders concerned as Southern Nevada faces an estimated housing shortage of more than 80000 units. Since 2020 the nonprofit has sold two of the five apartment complexes it owned. In January it listed the remaining three for sale before suddenly pulling back the listings in March.

“Whenever you’re losing one of those properties those people have to go somewhere” said Aaron Sheets director of operations for the housing nonprofit Hopelink of Southern Nevada. “And where’s that going to be?”

Downsizing at SHARE

SHARE’s portfolio is centered around downtown Las Vegas clustered together to create a village model blocks away from the city’s Arts District. The pedestrian-heavy area which is often bustling with traffic and construction is frequented by many of the city’s homeless disabled and low-income populations who utilize the nearby convenience stores and bus stops.

The bulk of rent payments for many SHARE residents is subsidized by either government agencies or other nonprofits. And SHARE Village 2 at 50 N. 21st St. is the operation’s hub. Tenants from multiple properties frequent the complex to get their mail receive social services from local agencies and pick up groceries donated by the Three Square food bank.

The status of the charity’s three remaining buildings has been in flux: They were being offered for a combined $32 million according to a now-deleted listing posted by the Powers-Armstrong real estate firm.

In an email obtained by the Review-Journal firm broker Mark Bennett claimed the properties’ new owner would be “not obligated legally or otherwise” to continue operating them as affordable housing.

If the buildings cease to operate as affordable housing Stalk would need to repay the $2 million the city of Las Vegas loaned SHARE in 2016 a city spokesman said.

But the posting was removed in late March after the Review-Journal began asking questions about the potential sale.

Stalk — alongside his wife and nonprofit co-founder Shannon Kelly — now asserts that they will continue operating the properties with Stout Management.

“We feel very confident that they can run the day-to-day and we can do the nonprofit side” Kelly said.

The downsizing of operations including hiring the property management company was necessary as Stalk battled ongoing health issues after contracting COVID-19 in 2020 they said.

Stalk’s decision to continue operations is a stark reversal from only a few months ago. Stalk 67 proclaimed in October he was planning his exit from charity work.

“This community has cured me of wanting to do anything philanthropic” he said at the time.

Stalk now says his previous statement was an emotional response to what he perceived as residents attacking him after his exit from SHARE Village 1 and the subsequent lawsuit.

“I took them from the street begging me to house them and then all of a sudden they’re on the news” he said.

Word of a possible sale at SHARE Village 4 on Fremont Street came as a shock to some residents.

Formerly homeless 65-year-old Marine veteran Timothy Thomas said he hopes to continue living in the converted motel where he pays $725 per month for a studio with a kitchenette. The federal government which subsidizes Thomas’ rent recently informed him that rent would go up $50 when his lease expires in September.

“I’m in that economic situation where I’m limited; affordable comes first” Thomas said as he clutched onto a duck-billed cane and gestured to the upstairs unit he has lived in for more than two years. “We need this.”

Tonjula Johnson who also lives on the second floor said she appreciated Stalk’s management of the building and that he had always been responsive to all her needs and concerns.

Though there are no longer plans to sell immediately Stalk and Kelly said any proceeds from the sale would have been used to support other local nonprofits.

But leaders at U.S. Vets — one of the named organizations which also houses clients at SHARE properties — said they were unaware of any such plans.

Exit at the flagship complex

Tenants at SHARE’s former flagship property have already experienced the uncertainty and apprehension that can follow the nonprofit’s departure.

Caridad the nonprofit that took over operations and renamed the property Hebron reported finding tenants’ medical records car titles and hundreds of other documents left behind in the front office.

Residents there said they pay hundreds of dollars in rent monthly while cooking food on hot plates and washing dishes in their bathroom sinks.

“I would love to be able to have a real kitchen with a real sink but you can’t find anything nowadays” said Cecelia Knapp an 80-year-old Navy veteran who has lived there since 2015.

At his first campus it felt like Stalk “was running a private motel and not really a program” Clark County Administrator of Human Services Tim Burch wrote in an October email to city of Las Vegas officials as he was trying to discern how many tenants there received government assistance.

Residents waited more than five months to get back their security deposits which totaled more than $42000 and were only returned after they obtained legal representation.

Stalk said the delay was the fault of property owner YSBM which received a check containing the deposits in September.

“We’re fair and we’re honest and every dollar was returned out of those tenant deposits” Stalk said.

Michael Stein YSBM’s attorney said the check was returned to SHARE in November months before it was finally dispersed to tenants.

“He abandoned the premises and then he tried to tell my client — that does nothing more than own the building — that they’re a landlord” he said.

Many veterans at the complex also began to doubt Stalk’s commitment. Some said they tried to reach their former landlord shortly after he left but that Stalk told them their housing was no longer his responsibility.

Army veteran Robert Hollaway recalled that Stalk suddenly left “out the door” overnight.

“You can’t profess to care about people and then do something like that” he said.

But Stalk maintains that every resident there was offered alternative housing by the county.

“I never abandoned it” he said. “To say that you abandoned a resident is so reckless.”

‘Low-income housing business’

Veterans at the flagship building are not the first to question Stalk.

When SHARE was still called Veterans Village a group of prominent Las Vegas veterans confronted Stalk and Kelly during a private meeting in 2019 stating that fewer than half of the residents were ex-military.

Army veteran Byron Brooks now an elected regent for the Nevada System of Higher Education said the group had received numerous complaints from veterans about their living conditions. Some alleged they faced eviction for being unable to cover the full rent amount even though most of it was guaranteed through federal housing subsidies according to Brooks.

“Veterans Village is nothing more than a low-income housing business” Brooks said. “The fact that Arnold Stalk used the veteran name and flew this business under the veteran flag is what most veterans in the community find extremely egregious and offensive.”

The nonprofit later changed its name to SHARE an acronym that stands for “supportive housing and resources for the elderly.”

Stalk said that Brooks felt slighted after he was not offered a job and that the nonprofit changed its name as part of its plan to expand its housing to non-veterans not because of the confrontation.

However another veteran at the meeting retired Marine Clay Barber echoed Brooks’ concerns.

“It was inferred several times that they were just kind of riding the coattails of the veteran name” said Barber who worked for the United Service Organizations nonprofit in Las Vegas at the time.

As of April 63 veteran residents living at SHARE properties were receiving VA assistance according to a spokesman. About 435 people live at the three locations SHARE’s website states.

Stalk’s reputation in the community

Since SHARE’s beginnings in 1994 Stalk expressed a passion for ending homelessness. It earned him glowing praise from Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman in 2020 when she presented him with a key to the city.

“This is a man who is so incredibly outstanding” Goodman said. “Doing all the time something for somebody else.”

Ribbon cuttings at his Veterans Village complexes were attended by members of the City Council casino executives and Nevada’s congressional delegation. In 2016 first lady Michelle Obama recognized him for his efforts.

Through a spokesman the city of Las Vegas declined an interview for this story.

Stalk has consistently cited his housing background and expertise as a community advocate and boasted of helping hundreds of thousands of vulnerable Las Vegans. He holds a bachelor’s and master’s degree from The Southern California Institute of Architecture and has prominently claimed a Ph.D. in media coverage on his LinkedIn profile and as part of the nonprofit’s branding.

However it’s unclear if he received the doctorate and LeGrand repeatedly ignored queries about it. The Review-Journal was unable to verify the advanced degree. SCI-Arc does not offer a doctorate.

Expert: Nonprofit ‘rife with red flags’

SHARE’s financial trajectory has markedly improved in the past five years said CharityWatch Executive Director Laurie Styron.

In both 2019 and 2020 it reported more than $3 million in revenue according to its latest federal tax filings. It also reported receiving more than $2 million in contributions and grants since 2016.

Among them are a $150000 donation from the Raiders in 2018; $1 million in materials and labor for a facility at SHARE Village 2 designed by Wynn Las Vegas in 2017; and the remodeling of 10 apartments by the local carpenters union last year. In February Renewal by Anderson installed new windows at SHARE Village 2 for the third time.

But some items in the financial reports raise serious questions about the nonprofit’s operations said Styron who reviewed the documents at the Review-Journal’s request. She noted that the records show SHARE does not have the most “basic governing policies” such as policies addressing conflict of interest document destruction or whistleblowers.

“This tax filing is just rife with red flags” said Styron an accountant whose organization investigates nonprofits. “It’s like having a puzzle where 80 percent of the pieces are missing.”

LeGrand said the charity has all three policies despite the nonprofit reporting “No” to having each policy in annual tax filings dating back to 2014.

The nonprofit also does not appear to provide independent audited financial statements to the federal government and its only listed board members are Stalk and his wife.

Stalk said he recently added a third member to SHARE’s board: his son a freshman at UNLV.

LeGrand said his clients are “people of immense integrity” who don’t need the “bureaucratic claptrap” of an independent board of directors.

“You need that if you lack integrity” he said.

He also said the charity is audited quarterly by its personal accountant but he declined to provide a copy of any audits to the Review-Journal citing concerns they would be published.

Disputes about repairs renovation

When SHARE left its flagship property abruptly in September its owner found the complex “in complete shambles” said Stein YSBM’s lawyer.

LeGrand claimed in court transcripts that his client spent more than $4 million in renovations. But YSBM’s lawsuit was settled shortly after the landlord demanded proof of the renovations Stein said.

“He’s a big talker but when we asked them for proof that was the end of it” he said.

Permit applications filed with the city show that just under $100000 in work has been done at the building since 2011 when Stalk signed the first lease.

The Review-Journal toured rooms at the building earlier this year that contained moldy drywall a doorframe with missing pieces and a bathroom with frozen and faulty valves. Workers found plywood glued to sinks shower pipes leaking into neighboring rooms and a complex in need of water heaters and a new central air conditioning unit.

Caridad founder Merideth Spriggs provided receipts and repair quotes that totaled about $75000 but estimated that it will cost hundreds of thousands more.

“If they really really cared about the tenants in this place why did they let it get so bad?” Spriggs asked.

SHARE said it had a full-time maintenance staff with at least one person on-call 24/7. Agencies renting the units did thorough inspections before moving clients in according to LeGrand who when asked about the building’s condition pointed a finger at Caridad.

“SHARE HAS NO IDEA what has been done to maintain the property for the past 8 months” he wrote in an email. “The facts are that Caridad signed off in November on the condition of the Property and is solely responsible for its condition today.”

But several residents said they had trouble getting repairs done under SHARE’s management.

The Nevada Attorney General’s Office received complaints in 2018 about SHARE Village 2 that described bedbugs and rodent droppings in the rooms. One complaint from a veteran read “the LLC has ignored problems and is merely seeking to extract monies through heavy-handed tactics.”

At SHARE Village 1 Angel Saavedra said her heater and air conditioner did not work and that her toilet did not flush properly for more than a year.

At the same property resident John Reaume said he “tolerated” water dripping from his bathroom ceiling for four years.

An ex-Air Force police officer who spoke to the Review-Journal on the condition she not be identified said her apartment at the flagship complex was littered with cockroaches and used razor blades when she moved in last August. Shortly after moving in she tested positive for MRSA a serious bacterial infection.But Navy veteran and resident Cynthia Kamaile Dias 70 said she had no ill feelings toward Stalk and did not blame him for how he left.

“We’re not perfect; all of us have made mistakes” she said. “Thank God I’m here. I was homeless and Arnold gave me a place.”

Caesars Entertainment spinoff VICI Properties said April 29 that it completed its $17.2 billion buyout of MGM Growth Properties the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. The deal was first announced last August and included the assumption of about $5.7 billion of debt.

As part of the sale VICI acquired several MGM Resorts-operated properties along Las Vegas Boulevard including Mandalay Bay MGM Grand The Mirage Park MGM New York-New York Luxor and Excalibur.

It also picked up several other casino properties outside Nevada including MGM Grand Detroit and MGM National Harbor near Washington D.C.

All told VICI is slated to receive more than $1 billion in initial annual rent from the newly acquired properties the firm indicated.

The buyout likely won’t result in noticeable changes at the resorts anytime soon as VICI does not operate the properties but rather collects rent from the companies that do.

Still it easily ranks among the largest real estate sales the Strip has ever seen and significantly expands VICI’s holdings in the famed casino corridor making the New York company one of the biggest property owners on Las Vegas Boulevard.

VICI now owns 10 resorts on the Strip totaling almost 41000 hotel rooms 1.2 million square feet of casino space and 5.9 million square feet of meeting and convention space company President and Chief Operating Officer John Payne said in a news release.

Company CEO Ed Pitoniak said the deal makes VICI the largest owner of hotel and conference real estate in America.

MGM Resorts which spun off MGM Growth in 2016 and was its controlling shareholder received about $4.4 billion in cash as part of the VICI buyout according to a company news release.

Operations at MGM Resorts-run properties now owned by VICI ""will continue as before for guests and employees"" MGM spokesman Brian Ahern told the Review-Journal.

NEVADA REGULATORS OK COMPANY BUYING CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT

MGM will use proceeds from the deal to invest in its ""core business"" President and CEO Bill Hornbuckle said in a May 2 earnings call adding the company would also ""continue to seek meaningful growth opportunities.""

MGM announced it is offering $607 million to buy LeoVegas a Swedish online gaming firm. It also is in the process of buying the operations side of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas for more than $1.6 billion; will begin spending on a new resort in Osaka Japan later this year; and plans to build a 1000-room resort in the United Arab Emirates.

VICI was spun off from Caesars Entertainment in 2017 as the casino chain’s main operating unit emerged from bankruptcy. By the end of that year VICI’s real estate holdings on the Strip consisted of Caesars Palace and Harrah’s a securities filing shows.

“About 200 deaths and 750 injuries occurred at Live Nation events since 2006” Democratic Congressman Bill Pascrell recently told The Post. “Have safety measures not improved? Has Live Nation silenced organizers? I want answers. I think the public deserves to know.”

In March the rep wrote to the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice calling for it to be easier to overturn mergers. He says the 2010 marriage between Live Nation and Ticketmaster was terrible for competition — and for safety at their events.

Since its merger with Ticket Master Live Nation controls a concert-goer’s experience basically from start to finish 85% of the time Pascrell said peddling the ticket owning the venue scheduling the show and promoting it too.

He and other critics claim the entertainment giant’s massive lucrative market share is leading to lackadaisical safety measures in the absence of real competition.

On May 3 famed controversial comedian Chappelle was attacked on stage at a Live Nation event with security provided by the same company that worked Astroworld.

Three days later the company said it had its “best first quarter ever” reporting $1.8 billion in revenue up from $290 million in the year-earlier quarter.

Live Nation did not return a Post request for comment but a source close to the company says it was only involved in promoting the Chappelle show and had no involved or say in the security measures.

When the fatal November 2021 crowd crush at rapper Travis Scott’s Astroworld Festival killed 10 people and injured hundreds more in Houston Texas many blamed the artist.

But Pascrell and other politicians including the influential House Committee on Oversight and Reform have since turned their attention to Live Nation which organized the event.

After the Astroworld tragedy members of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform wrote to the company in December 2021 “Reports indicate that security and medical staff were inexperienced or ill-equipped to deal with mass injuries.

“Some attendees stated that the placement of barricades made it difficult to escape. Experts have stated that Astroworld Festival organizers failed to heed warning signs.”

A $750 million lawsuit brought on behalf of the victims claims security personnel were “grossly overwhelmed” by the crowds that broke through barriers and stormed the event to see the rapper perform.

The House pols also claimed that the company was trying to escape liability for its role in Astroworld.

“Live Nation and its subsidiary reportedly have withheld pay until part-time employees who worked the festival have signed a revised employment contract correcting the original version signed prior to the festival that was dated 2018” the Congress members wrote. “The revision makes it clear that the contract which includes a broad provision releasing Live Nation from liability applies to the 2021 festival.”

The company’s allegedly dismal safety record includes:

The ever-growing list of incidents and deaths is proof enough the company needs serious reform critics claim.

“They may double the profits and they still didn’t do anything about the safety of folks who go to their concerts” Pascrell said. “The disaster results are obvious in terms of how many people died. They got to be held accountable just like any other business.”

And it’s not just Democrats calling for the breakup of Live Nation.

Mark Perry of the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank called for an end to the Live Nation and Ticketmaster monopoly last year saying it artificially jacks up concert prices and screws over fans.

“It’s only going to get worse unless Washington lawmakers and regulators step in with a fix” Perry wrote.

Pascrell said that there’s “no way out” when you have “larger corporations controlling more and more of the entertainment.

“So Congress has to come up with some way to break up Live Nation” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZhbGxleWxlZGdlci5jb20vP3A9MTEyMDk20gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ENGAGEMENT ARENA TOUR: 'MANILOW: HITS 2022' COMING TO THE PPL CENTER AUGUST 12TH,"ENGAGEMENT ARENA TOUR: ‘MANILOW: HITS 2022’ COMING TO THE PPL CENTER AUGUST 12TH

In 2016 Deadspin reported that CSC had been sued at least 21 times in federal court since 1991 on claims of assault battery personal injury and civil rights violations. Many cases resulted in out-of-court settlements between the parties with CSC denying the accusations.

Some of their lawsuits alleged that CSC cut corners by hiring inexperienced people at low wages to fill positions shortly before events were set to begin.

At Miami’s Ultra Music Festival in 2014 a CSC security guard named Erica Mack suffered two skull fractures severe brain hemorrhaging and a broken leg after gate-crashers trampled her according to a $10 million gross negligence lawsuit she filed against Ultra CSC and others responsible for the event.

In her lawsuit Mack then 29 alleged that CSC knowingly put her in an area vulnerable to gate-crashers given past incidents and took down stronger fencing at the request of a beverage company vendor leaving her helpless. The complaint stated that there were “insufficient CSC security guards and police” and that they failed to “provide adequately trained personnel in the area where she was injured” ultimately failing “to maintain a safe workplace.”

“CSC placed Mack in direct contact with violent individuals without warning her of the danger and without putting reasonable minimum safeguards in place to protect her from foreseeable serious bodily harm” the lawsuit stated.

The defendants argued that there was not enough evidence to prove gross negligence and that they were not liable for her injuries because Mack was not an employee but a contractor. The case was eventually dismissed.

In 2020 hundreds of CSC workers settled with the company for $1.22 million after accusing them of failing to pay their minimum wages not giving them rest or meal breaks and not reimbursing them for expenses among other alleged labor law violations. As part of the settlement agreement CSC denied all liability and asserted that the workers’ claims had no merit and the company had acted lawfully.



Some CSC workers have also raised concerns on Glassdoor a jobs site where employees can leave anonymous reviews for companies. CSC has 3.8 stars and many reviewers praise the flexibility the ability to see concerts and “easy-going staff.” But others have complained about the low pay lack of breaks and lack of training.

In one review for CSC from April 2 of this year a person wrote that the company is prone to changing rules and policies on a whim and that “the pay sucks considering the type of work we do and sometimes the job can be dangerous.” Another from Sept. 12 2021 said “There's no training for the job. You get yelled at by customers because you're not doing a job that you were never trained for correctly.”

In a 2011 review a person who said they were an independent contractor for CSC wrote that “advanced training for event staff is ‘call the police when u see someone dying.’""

Several online job postings from CSC show that the company requires no previous security experience and pegs the job as “something fun and exciting” and an opportunity to “experience some of the greatest in entertainment.”

“No experience necessary We Will Train You and we offer paid training for all Nevada PILB Security Guard positions” one Las Vegas job posting by CSC reads.

On March 18 CSC posted part-time positions for event staff and security jobs for the Hollywood Bowl the Rose Bowl and other LA venues for $15 to $17 an hour.

The staffer who worked security at Chappelle’s show the night of the attack told BuzzFeed News that there wasn’t “a real hiring process” and that he easily got the CSC job through a friend because the company was looking to staff up quickly. He claimed that other CSC contractors there had not worked security before and did not have experience using metal detectors or thoroughly checking bags.

CSC also barely provided any training he alleged adding that two days before the show the company hosted a security briefing and then gave everyone a blue-and-yellow T-shirt.

On the day of the event CSC security leaders held a meeting for their sections the worker told BuzzFeed News warning that there was going to be a big crowd and to get people in as fast as possible so there would not be a buildup outside when the show began at 7 p.m.

“The crowd started getting bigger and I was thinking the whole time there is no way people were being thoroughly checked at the rate people were walking in” said the security employee who did not want to be named for fear of retaliation. “I feel anyone could have brought anything in.”

Gil Fried an expert in crowd management who wrote a textbook called Academy for Venue Safety and Security said it is not a safe business practice to hire inexperienced workers for major events.

“Hiring training and supervising people that are working on the front lines is the most critical element of any crowd management plan” he said. “The more time you spend investing in people the better. That will help create the safest environment possible.”

Los Angeles authorities are now investigating how the assailant breached security and accessed the Hollywood Bowl stage during Tuesday's Chappelle show.

Brushing off the seriousness of the attack that night Chappelle acknowledged that he was lucky while addressing the crowd:

“Thank god that nigga was clumsy.”"

MARGARET BRENNAN: We now turn to Jim Taiclet the CEO of defense giant Lockheed Martin which makes some of the weapons the US is sending to Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Good morning to you sir.

JIM TAICLET: Good morning Margaret. Happy Mother's Day to you.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much for saying that. We hear time and again one of the most powerful tools the Ukrainians have are these anti-tank Russian tank busting missiles known as javelins. That's what your company jointly produces with Raytheon. How quickly can you scale up production to get more to them and to backfill what the US has given up?

TAICLET: Sure Margaret. Well the president visited us in Troy Alabama to thank the workforce earlier this week and we really appreciate what he's done for us. We are therefore on our side accelerating our investment in that factory and in our workforce there. So we're already investing ahead of time to buy tooling to expand the plant and also support our suppliers to get ready to ramp up production. So right now our capacity is 2100 Javelin missiles per year. We're endeavoring to take that up to 4000 per year and that will take a number of months maybe even a couple of years to get there because we have to get our supply chain to-to also crank up. As we do so we think we can almost double the capacity in a reasonable amount of time.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Raytheon had said that the different system the Stingers they couldn't even get going on ramping that up until 2023. But you can start when exactly?

TAICLET: We're starting now to ramp it up because we have an active production line right now that the president saw. And also we've got a supply chain that's active in addition to that. So we can start turning up the heat now and- and ramping the production immediately because of those circumstances.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You said- well you implied- you're- you're basically doing it on spec right. You're anticipating that order is going to come through from the US government. But you're a business person you have to plan ahead. We don't know how long this war is going to last. CIA says you know Vladimir Putin thinks he's got a double down here. So how long are you planning for with this ramp up?

TAICLET: Well we're planning for the long run and not just in the Javelin because this situation the Ukraine conflict has highlighted a couple of really important things for us. One is that we need to have superior systems in large enough numbers. So like Javelin Stingers advanced cruise missiles equipment like that. So we know there's going to be increased demand for those kinds of systems from the US and for our allies as well and beyond into Asia-Pacific most likely too. The second really valuable lesson was control of the airspace is really critical. So the Ukrainians are managing to control their airspace. The Russian air force doesn't have free rein over the entire country. And the reason that they don't is because the Ukrainians can still fly their aircraft and they also have a pretty effective integrated air and missile defense system. So products and systems like F-16 F-35 Patriot missiles VAD missiles. We know that there's going to be increased demand for those kinds of equipment too because the threat between Russia and China is just going to increase even after the Ukraine war we hope is over soon. Those two nations and regionally Iran and North Korea are not going to get less active. Probably they're going to get more active. So we want to make sure we can-can supply our allies and our country what they need to defend against that.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So what do you need to do that? Because you did say supply chain's an issue. I read that there's over 250 microchips or semiconductors in each javelin.

TAICLET: That's right.

MARGARET BRENNAN: We know there's an effort in Congress to get legislation to try to create more semiconductors here instead of relying on Asian suppliers. Can you do this scale up without that kind of legislation?

TAICLET: It will be extremely helpful to have the Bipartisan Innovation Act passed for example because we do need to invest more in the infrastructure in the US so we have domestic supply especially in microprocessors. And so our production line can run today but in the future we're going to need more domestic capability and microprocessor not only design but manufacturing testing etc. so that we have assured supply of those microprocessors in the future. And they'll be other inputs too. But that's one of the highlighted ones.

MARGARET BRENNAN:But we've heard on this program time and again for business people how important that is to get done. Congress still hasn't voted on it voted it through. Do you have any commitments from anyone here in Washington to- to get this to the president's desk soon?

TAICLET: Well we know that there's a lot of support for it both in Congress and the administration-

MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it takes time to scale up.

TAICLET: Etc.. Yes it does. It takes years. And so we're collaborating right now for example with Intel it's one of our partners and trying to drive what we call 21st century security into national defense. And we're going to need the most advanced processors and we're going to need them to be customizable to defense needs as well. So having that domestic capability again to. All the way through production and testing is going to be more important in the future than it is even today.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You also make F-35 fighter jets you referenced there. Germany is now trying to buy them. I mean you have a lot of buyers in Europe right now potentially. Do you have enough workers to meet all of these requests?

TAICLET: We have enough now. But we know like for example in the F-16 line as well that we're building up in South Carolina actually. We need more workers. And so we're recruiting heavily. We've got a very strong workforce in Fort Worth Texas where we make the F-35. So that production line is running just fine now. We've got sufficient employees there to do that. But in other parts of the country and ultimately in Texas we're going to need to actually hire more people.

MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Thank you very much for giving us insight into your business.

TAICLET: Glad to do it.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And being here in person. We'll be right back.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL2x1ZmtpbmRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9sb2NraGVlZC1zaXRlLWRpcmVjdG9yLXNwZWFrcy1hdC1maXJzdC1mcmlkYXkvYXJ0aWNsZV9kYjQ4YmU0Yi1iYmFhLTU0NzctYWU0My0xYTQ5ZWUxYjI2MmQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lockheed site director speaks at First Friday | Local & State | lufkindailynews.com,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

LINCOLN Calif. — Update from May 9:

Mick the miniature poodle was turned in to the Lincoln Police Department by the woman who took the poodle according to a social media post from the Oates family. Now Mick is safe and sound with his family!

BACK HOME!!!! Thank you everyone for your support and efforts in getting him back. The woman who took him turned him into the Lincoln PD this morning. Posted by Robert Sarah Oates on Monday May 9 2022

Original story

An afternoon shopping trip at the Lowe's Home Improvement store in Lincoln quickly turned into a nightmare for David and Sharon Smith last Thursday.

The Bay area couple was in town visiting their daughter and grandkids and brought their five-year-old miniature poodle named Mick to the store placing him in their cart.

""They came to look at umbrellas for their table"" said Sarah Oates their daughter. ""There was an end display with a gentleman working on it and they couldn't get their cart through so for a brief moment they walked around the corner.""

When the couple walked back to their cart Mick was nowhere to be found according to Oates.

""He's a well-trained dog he never jumps out of anything he obeys off-leash commands"" said Oates. ""My dad came outside and whistled (and) my mom was going through the store asking for help. The employees pulled up (surveillance) video and that's when they saw that it was indeed a theft from a woman.""

ABC10 spoke to a store manager who said he's aware of the incident and also reached out to Lowes’ corporate offices for more information. For now Oates is offering a $2000 cash reward for Mick's return and said her parents have filed a report with the Lincoln Police Department.

""I just hope that if the person who took him sees this they'll realize how much they've hurt our family"" said Oates. ""We just want our dog back.""

ABC10 also reached out to the Lincoln Police Department but have not received a response yet.

At that point the second baseman had gone 19 games 79 plate appearances and 69 at-bats since his last home run on April 14. Before he felt like he had time to settle into the batter’s box Lowe took a sinker from Gonzales for strike one. Then he connected on the next pitch a changeup near the top of the zone and watched it fly.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9tbGIvcmF5cy9uZXdzL3RvbS1icmV3LW15LXR3by1jZW50cy10YW1wYS1iYXktYnJhbmRvbi1sb3dlLWdldHRpbmctaG90LXR3by1ob21lLXJ1bnMtbGluZXVwLWdldHRpbmctbG9uZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,My Two Cents: With Brandon Lowe Emerging Rays' Lineup Gets Very Long,"It's starting to look like Brandon Lowe's slow start in April is now a thing of the past. The Tampa Bay second baseman seems to have ''cracked the code'' after hitting two home runs on Saturday in the 8-2 win over Seattle. With several other hitters getting hot too the Rays' lineup is suddenly very deep and long and hard to get through for any pitcher.

OAKLAND Calif. — It's been a long first month to the baseball season for Tampa Bay second baseman Brandon Lowe but that's the thing about Lowe ever the tinkerer ever the worker ever the internal motivator.

The glass-half-full guy and incessant note-taker in him also knows this: ""It's ONLY been a month'' he said Saturday night after hitting two early home runs to help the Rays get an 8-2 victory over the Seattle Mariners their sixth straight on a long West Coast road trip.

Lowe's tough start appears to be over with the simple turn of the calendar. He was brutal in April hitting just .177 and he went his final 14 April games — and 51 at-bats — without hitting a home run.

But since Sunday and the start of a new month he's had a hit in all seven games. He's seeing the ball better — four walks in the past two games — and he's laying off bad pitches. He's been hitting the ball hard all week and on Saturday night he got two balls elevated for home runs.

Here we go again.

This same thing happened last year when he hit just .182 in April. Unlike this year so far May wasn't great though but it got better every month from there in his 39-homer 99-RBI season. He hit .241 in June .288 in July .262 in August and .301 in September.

It's starting to come for Lowe who has worked hard in the cage to fine-tune things and he relies heavily on his handwritten notes something he does since his days in college at Maryland.

“We figured some stuff out’’ Lowe said. “I have a notebook that I write a lot of stuff down in and hopefully we cracked a few codes and we’re going to start having some fun.

“There were some mental adjustments and physical adjustments. It’s hard to just place one little thing because hitting is very difficult. You don’t get to just write one thing and be like ‘OK this is a fix-all kind of moment. Baseball is kind of that way where one week it feels like you’re going to hit six homers and then you go a couple of weeks without hitting a homer. Baseball’s a weird game that way.''

Lowe said he has about 15 notebooks dating back to college. He has a new digital reMarkable notebook now but he still gets to hand-write the notes which lets them sink in better.

""It's something in college that I figured out that I learned and remembered stuff better when I wrote it down instead of typing it or anything'' Lowe said. ""Madison (his wife) actually got me a fancy notebook where it's electric but I have the ability and feel of me writing in it. But I have like 15 notebooks and I have them all in the same spot so that's nice.''

Lowe knows that baseball isn't an easy game so he tries to keep his frustration level in check when he's struggling. Still it feels good to see progress.

""Understanding that baseball is the game that it is last year was probably one of the worst starts that I ever had but it turned out that I had a pretty good season'' Lowe said. ""This year hasn't been as bad as that. It didn’t feel like a home run drought or anything like that. It’s not like I hadn’t been hitting the ball hard. It just hadn’t been in the air.”

Rays manager Kevin Cash was thrilled to see Lowe's multi-homer night. He had even said earlier in the week that Lowe's at-bats were becoming more productive and he could sense a turnaround coming.

It's here

“Yeah that was really encouraging’’ Cash said of the two solo shots. “Good for Brandon. I know he likes hitting home runs and we like it when he hits home runs.’’

And what did Cash see differently from Lowe?

“Just getting closer with his contact rate’’ Cash said. “The misses kind of turned maybe into ‘just misses.’ It was nothing that really stuck out just the feel more importantly than anything that he’s really good and he’s not going to go south much longer. He’s proven that he’s a really good hitter.’

Lowe's solid week has coincided with several others in the Rays' order finally getting hot too. Manuel Margot is 11-for-25 this week with two huge homers and 12 RBIs. A couple of other guys who struggled in April — outfielder Randy Arozarena and catcher Mike Zunino — are getting hot too.

That's what we're seeing in this six-game winning streak. Sure the pitching has remained mostly very good but now the Rays' lineup is a battle for any opposing pitcher from top to bottom. It's a long lineup at the moment with no time to catch your breath. Shoot Saturday night even No. 9 hitter Kevin Kiermaier had two hits.

The Rays have scored 39 runs on this trip so far a 6.5 clip through the six wins. With their pitching — they've only allowed 20 this trip with seven in two games and only a total of six runs in the other four — that's going to win a lot of games.

Getting Lowe going is huge because he is a top-of-the-order guy and you need production out of him. Winning magnifies the good things of course but the Rays are really starting to put everything together after a slow-ish start to the season.

Getting everyone rolling at once is scary. Arozarena who hit .195 in April and still hasn't hit a home run already has 10 hits in May and the month is only seven days old. He only had 15 hits in April in 77 at-bats

Same with Zunino. Through April 28 he was hitting .083 with just three hits in 36 at-bats with no homers and just one RBI. But since then he's hit three homers and driven in eight runs. Throw in fellow catcher Francisco Mejia being back from COVID — he of the .407 batting average — and that's a lot of production all at once.

Baseball is a fickle game of course and there's no telling if all this production contnues but it sure seems like the Rays are heading in the right direction. He have zero worries with the top of the rotation with Shane McClanahan Drew Rasmussen and Corey Kluber and the best guys in the bullpen make up a best-in-the-league group.

The question has always been will the Rays hit enough? Now that guys are finally getting hot that question is getting answered.

The Rays are 18-10 now tied with the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Angels for the most wins in the American League. They're playing well which comes at a perfect time because it's hard to win a lot of games on a 10-day West Coast swing. They've already assured themselves of a winning record on the trip with four games to one one more Sunday in Seattle and then three in Anaheim against former skipper Joe Maddon and the Angels.

Get hot stay hot. That's always the goal.

And it seems to be happening.

The Vikings entered the draft with this pick and didn’t trade it.

Vederian Lowe was ranked 225th on the consensus big board and the 21st ranked offensive tackle.

TRAITS

Lowe played tackle at Illinois and could either compete at swing tackle or move inside to guard where he has a higher RAS score. But he has ideal arm length to play at tackle too.

Lowe turned 23 in April.

COLLEGE GRADES AND STATS

Lowe was a 3-star recruit out of high school and took his only Power 5 college offer from Illinois where he grew up. He took advantage of his extra year of eligibility due to Covid in 2021 his fifth year as a starter. He started a total of 49 games at left tackle and 3 at right tackle his freshman year. He was Honorable Mention All-B1G his last two seasons.

SCOUTING REPORTS

Dane Brugler The Athletic:

STRENGTHS: Looks the part with outstanding arm length ... uses footwork to widen his base and stay centered ... adjusts his slide quickness to answer the counters of pass rushers ... flashes the strength in his hands to strike and stay connected ... keeps his feet firing to create movement in the run game ... his penalties declined each season attracting just two flags as a super-senior (one false start one holding) ... married and mature family man with dependable character ... durable; set the school record for career starts at Illinois (52) including 46 consecutively ... was a three-year starter at right tackle in high school and has functional experience at both tackle spots. WEAKNESSES: His pads start high and remain high ... needs to improve his lower-body bend to sink his hips and anchor at the point of attack ... his range as a pass blocker is average and NFL wide speed will be a challenge ... too much of a catch blocker and his hands lack precision and placement ... doesn’t stay controlled when working up a level ... can be caught off guard by twists and delays ... his upper half gets overextended in the run game sacrificing his balance ... didn’t play a snap on the interior of the offensive line in college. SUMMARY: A five-year starter at Illinois Lowe has been a fixture at left tackle for the Illini in former offensive coordinator Tony Petersen’s zone-based scheme. Despite cycling through three different offensive coordinators and three different offensive line coaches over the last five years he got better each season and proved his durability with the most starts in school history. Lowe is a mature developed player with the footwork to adjust to targets in space and allow his long arms to work for him. His pad level can get away from him and he needs to be a more consistent leverage blocker. Overall Lowe is an average athlete and tends to be over-reliant on his upper half but he stays under control to square up defenders as a pass blocker or drive them in the run game. He is prepared to compete for an NFL backup job as a rookie.

Lance Zierlein nfl.com:

Offensive line prospect who checks multiple boxes in both the traits and intangibles categories. Evaluators are sure to love Lowe’s personal character as well as his measurables. He’s big strong and long but needs to play with better hand accuracy and technique to fully unlock those traits. Bend and athleticism are both strengths for Lowe who is a scheme-independent talent. He’s allowed too many pressures and sacks during his career but has the tools for rapid improvement with a few coaching fixes. Lowe is worthy of middle-round consideration as a swing tackle with guard potential.

Tony Pauline Pro Football Network:

Vederian Lowe was someone who impressed me on film. The underclassman left tackle blocks with leverage and strength and is moderately effective in motion. He has a next-level frame and makes great use of positioning and angles to seal defenders from the action. I would like to see Lowe develop a nasty streak and he is very likely to move to the right side or inside to guard at the next level.

Kyle Crabbs The Draft Network:

Illinois offensive tackle Vederian Lowe is an intriguing prospect who appears to offer a number of enticing tools to work with at the next level. Lowe is a long-tenured starter with the Illini program who logged a program-record 52 career starts. It is difficult to ignore the step forward in play that Lowe took this past season under the direction of head coach Bret Bielema. Lowe has prototypical tackle size and measurables and did well in each of the games studied in regards to both pass protection and effective play at the point of attack. Lowe isn’t someone who should be considered a finished product and he is an older prospect but I find myself intrigued by the flashes of improvement he’s illustrated. If Lowe is able to land in an environment with an effective offensive line coach this is someone I could absolutely see being a starter down the road. Lowe is mature off the field too—he’s married with two children and has illustrated an impressive ability to balance school athletics and family life so he gives the impression of someone that already brings a professional mentality to the game. Lowe a Shrine Bowl participant is one of my personal favorite day-three offensive tackle prospects. Ideal role: Developmental starting left tackle Scheme tendencies: Scheme diverse Balance: Lowe carries his weight well and was not stressed when tasked with getting outside on the perimeter. He does well to recover his balance when taking lateral contact or punches. He does well to keep his base active after contact to ensure he doesn’t fall off his blocks. Pass Sets: Lowe has enough functional mobility for me to believe that he can play on the edge and protect the edge. He played in a high run-volume offense for effectively his entire career—the Illini never averaged more than 28 pass attempts per game across all five seasons of play. His angles as a result can be irregular and he’ll be forced to bail early off his set. But when faced with tight-angle rushers or when not stressed with pure speed from wide angles he clearly has the foot speed to frame effectively. Competitive Toughness: I’ve watched Lowe on a number of plays ride defenders through the end of the whistle playing chippy and riding them well out of the frame. He’s got good functional strength and when he’s on his base and well-timed with his hands he can deliver quite the stun. He can have his power compromised by poor technique and will need to continue to focus on hands and timing to play at a sustainable level for the pros. Lateral Mobility: Lowe is sufficient in his lateral agility and ability to string out the point of attack. He’s turned out the end man on the line of scrimmage in multiple games and successfully transitioned to steer them out of the frame. His short-area agility when oversetting appears to be at a level that can help him protect versus inside counters in a more high volume dropback passing offense. Length: Lowe has a prototypical build for playing on the edge in the NFL. He’s got a broad torso and plenty of reach in his wingspan to pay with a large area of influence. Football IQ: This is a highly experienced starter who seemed to really take to Bielema’s coaching and presence in 2021. I am intrigued about how much further his technical advancements can continue as he’s a high-tools prospect who will meet thresholds to be considered a tackle. His ability to identify twists and stunts up front in pass protection is a big plus. Hand Technique: His placement on first contact can be wide and I would like to see continued attention paid to resetting hands to work and get an inside fit—too often he was content with high and outside placement. He has shown a strong clamp to seal leverage and control a gap. Grip strength at full extension is strong to help him maintain control of blocks. Anchor Ability: His raw ability to sit down on power rushes is notable when he isn’t stressed and trying to flip and carry off the edge. He handled exchanges on twists and stunts well to get fully framed and absorb contact before sitting down on his hips. His punch timing and hand placement are going to go a long way in determining his consistency here. Power at POA: I was impressed watching him against the EDGE defenders of Penn State and Wisconsin—both of which he had a significant size advantage over but still managed to apply that power on the edge. He’s got good upper-body strength and sufficient leg drive and foot speed. Versatility: The Illini have taken opportunities to cook up unbalanced lines and put him on the right side but I would generally consider him to be a left tackle first and foremost. He moves well enough to stay sticky in zone and has enough power to uproot and move defenders in gap concepts.

FIT WITH THE VIKINGS

While Vederian Lowe could compete at swing tackle I get the sense from the Vikings scout who commented on him Chisom Opara that the Vikings will look at him inside at guard. Opara talked about Lowe’s position versatility and that he has the body type to play guard. He also talked about the Vikings being more of a mid-zone team now rather than a wide-zone team and the impact that had on the type of offensive linemen they select. They’re looking for guys who have the footwork and enough athleticism for the mid-zone scheme but who can also ‘dent’ opposing defenders suggesting a greater preference for size and power. I doubt he’d have gone down this road if the intent was to keep him at tackle. The bottom line here is that they’re okay with good not great athleticism if that also means greater size and power at the point of attack. Lowe has that.

But from his game film he isn’t particularly dominant nor a consistent finisher. He seems to depend a lot on winning with his hands and length and when he doesn’t win the hand fighting he tends to lose the rep. He’s a little awkward at times as well which leads you to think he could have more difficulty with more polished pass rushers in the NFL. He’s not someone who’s going to give up bull rushes and some of his difficulties may be mitigated with a move inside but that remains to be seen.

Overall Lowe showed a jump in performance his last season with the Illini but still needing to improve his technique after five seasons in Illinois may be a bit of a red flag. If he continues to improve under NFL coaching he could work his way up the depth chart but he’s unlikely to be active for games as a rookie.

The chairman of the governing board at Little Rock's public housing agency filed a federal complaint in April against a fired executive director alleging financial misconduct and a conflict of interest.

Chairman Kenyon Lowe's complaint to the watchdog arm of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development marks the latest move in an ongoing fight between the Metropolitan Housing Alliance's board of commissioners and former Executive Director Nadine Jarmon who has argued that her firing in August was retaliation for her levying similar allegations of wrongdoing against the board.

In the April 2 complaint to HUD's Office of Inspector General Lowe accused Jarmon of misusing funds allocated to the Metropolitan Housing Alliance by the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act a 2021 federal covid-19 relief package.

Lowe said Jarmon made ""unauthorized salary adjustments by raising all employees' salary to $60000 per year"" with the goal of exempting them from overtime pay.

Lowe's complaint only provided a list of employees who received ""hazardous pay"" in portions of 2020 and 2021.

The housing authority provided the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette with spreadsheets detailing salary increases for six agency employees who were promoted in 2021 as well as a list of ""hazard pay"" allotted to almost all agency employees via CARES Act funds in response to an Arkansas Freedom of Information Act request Friday.

Twenty-nine employees received a total of nearly $400000 in hazard pay according to the documents.

Lowe stated in the complaint that agency employees who worked from home in the covid-19 pandemic should not have received hazard pay because they were not required to work in their offices and therefore did not count as ""essential workers.""

Lowe also said Jarmon authorized the hazard pay without the necessary board approval.

The payments came to the board's attention during a recent routine review of the agency's finances Lowe said.

""We want to be transparent with the public because it's public money"" he said. ""Looking at the definition of hazard pay we don't think it fits the criteria and you can see the exorbitant amounts that were paid out.""

He said possible financial misconduct is HUD's responsibility to investigate.

""If there's nothing there there's nothing there but that's not a call for the housing authority to make"" Lowe said.

Jarmon declined to comment on Lowe's accusations citing her pending federal lawsuit against the agency over allegations of wrongful termination.

Her attorney Chris Corbitt said he ""will respond in due time"" to what ""appear to be baseless"" allegations.

The Democrat-Gazette requested board-approved resolutions pertaining to CARES Act spending via an Arkansas Freedom of Information Act request but the Metropolitan Housing Alliance had not provided any resolutions as of Friday evening.

The alliance oversees about 900 traditional public housing units 200 affordable housing units and 160 market-rate units. It also administers more than 2000 Section 8 vouchers. It is the largest public housing authority in Arkansas and provides housing assistance to about 8000 low-income people.

Lowe's complaint alleges that Jarmon and the housing authority's former contracts and procurement coordinator Jada Johnson improperly procured and maintained several contracts with other entities including ""an illegal contract with an information technology contractor since 2012.""

The contract was with a Roland-based company called Advanced Networking. The agency ended its business relationship with the company in May 2021 after hiring an in-house information technology director according to documents Jarmon provided to the Democrat-Gazette.

Lowe said one of his primary concerns in his complaint was about a consulting business Jarmon has run since 2004. Lowe did not mention this business NKA Contractors in his April 2 complaint to the federal housing department but he sent a follow-up email April 3 with an allegation of ""Dr. Jarmon and Jada [Johnson] doing business of personal use in using the resources of MHA.""

In an attachment to his complaint Lowe provided a document with corporate information about Jarmon's company. The information was pulled from the Arkansas secretary of state's website. It shows that the company is in ""good standing"" and lists Jarmon as its incorporator/organizer and Johnson as its registered agent.

NKA Contractors has provided ""public sector consulting services"" to public housing authorities since Jarmon started the company in 2004 according to its website. The company is also registered in New York Florida and Louisiana.

Jarmon provided the Democrat-Gazette with emails between her and the Metropolitan Housing Alliance board from the summer of 2020 when the board had just chosen her to lead the agency. She disclosed her privately owned business to the board and said she wanted to begin her contract with the housing authority under her company name ""instead of as an individual [to] minimize the appearance of 'double dipping'"" according to an email from Aug. 13 2020.

Johnson resigned from the Metropolitan Housing Alliance on March 15.

Lowe alluded to his complaints against Jarmon and Johnson at the board's regular monthly meeting on April 21 when he read aloud an April 19 email from the Office of Inspector General acknowledging receipt of his messages earlier that month.

He then sent the complaint to the Democrat-Gazette last week.

ALLEGATIONS OF OVERREACH

Jarmon was the agency's interim executive director from July 2020 to April 2021 when the board tapped her as the full-time executive director. Her two-year contract was set to pay her $166000 a year.

Her departure was part of a revolving door of leadership at the housing authority which has seen six interim or official executive directors in the past 3½ years. She and her two immediate predecessors left or were forced out after clashes with the board of commissioners.

The board initially chose Jarmon for the executive director post in 2019 but she declined the offer. The board restarted the search and eventually chose Anthony Snell for the post. Snell resigned in June 2020 and wrote in his resignation letter that the board had harmed and micromanaged the agency.

At the same time as Snell's resignation a group of anonymous agency employees wrote a letter to Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott Jr.'s office asking for the removal of all five members of the board. The employees said they were anonymous ""due to a fear of future retaliation"" and alleged both excessive oversight and ""great incompetence"" from the board.

Jarmon made the same request for the board's removal in her June 2021 complaint a 161-page memo to Scott's office and the federal housing department's Little Rock field office. The memo included a collection of emails bank statements board minutes board resolutions and other documents -- including Snell's resignation letter -- as exhibits.

Like Snell Jarmon said the board overinvolved itself in the housing authority's day-to-day operations. Her other allegations included unnecessary spending the sidestepping of necessary federal approvals and conflicts of interest between commissioners and parties involved in transactions with the housing authority.

Arkansas law gives local governments the power to remove housing authority commissioners ""for inefficiency or neglect of duty or misconduct in office.""

However Scott's office said in September that the city was in a holding pattern awaiting the conclusion of HUD's investigation into Jarmon's complaint.

Lowe dismissed Jarmon's allegations as ""noise"" and ""conjecture"" at the time they were made. He also said Jarmon's memo had no teeth because she did not send it directly to HUD's Office of Inspector General.

The board suspended Jarmon with pay shortly after she filed the complaint and it fired her two months later.

Shortly before her firing Jarmon filed a second complaint with HUD alleging that her suspension was retaliation for her first complaint.

In October Jarmon sued the housing authority on the grounds of wrongful termination alleging that her firing was retaliation for her second complaint against the board. The suit requests financial compensation for ""irreparable harm to her reputation"" as well as ""emotional pain and turmoil"" according to court documents.

The HUD Office of Inspector General said in a March letter to Corbitt that it had closed its investigation into Jarmon's retaliation complaint citing the pending federal lawsuit. The letter specified that it was only about one complaint and that investigations into waste fraud and abuse were a separate matter.

HUD's Departmental Enforcement Center was investigating Jarmon's initial complaint in August a spokesperson said at the time.

Upon Jarmon's suspension then-financial director Andy Delaney served as the housing authority's acting executive director from June to September before leaving the agency. The board chose Ericka Benedicto former diversity chief for the city of Little Rock as interim director before hiring her on an official basis in January.

The night before his team had lost by seven points at home to a middling Charlotte Hornets squad and the Bucks’ new coach Jason Kidd was angry. Milwaukee who were hovering around .500 were slated to have the holiday off to spend with family but Kidd changed those plans and decided his roster should practice – as punishment. The players had to cancel flights and alert their family of the change – something of course they did not want to do. During the Christmas Eve practice Sanders went full-on. He didn’t lollygag but peeved he also didn’t back away from engaging his coach in confrontation. Afterwards while he was the last one left in the locker room his body started to break down.

“I was cramping from my ears to my toes” Sanders tells the Guardian. “Full body cramps.”

It was the second time that this stress reaction had happened to him during his young career and it forced Sanders to quickly seek medical treatment. Sanders was hospitalized that Christmas Eve and Christmas. He never returned to the Bucks practice facility again despite having signed a four-year $44m contract extension the year before. “I physically and mentally could not get myself back there” he says. “Nothing could get me in the car to go there. I had such a block.” The 6ft 11in center who’d averaged nearly a double-double and almost three blocks per game a few seasons before was now the one stifled. “I didn’t touch a basketball for the next two years. Not a shot not a dribble.”

Sanders was born on 21 November 1988 in Fort Pierce Florida and grew up “in the trenches”. There were gangs seemingly on every street in his neighborhood. His parents split when he was a kid and both suffered from untreated mental health issues. “They had all this trauma” Sanders says “all this pain. They were predisposed to a lot of violence [while] not understanding the power of therapy the power of meditation.”

As a kid Sanders loved to draw. It was his “getaway.” He wanted to illustrate comics and work for Disney. He had a deep interest in the ocean too won a grant to study oceanography and got to ride in submarines. He was tall but didn’t have any particular interest in basketball. But it was a basketball that would save him.

“Because I lived in the projects” Sanders says “automatically where you live there are places you can’t go [due to gang conflicts].” He found that if he rode his bike from his home to his grandmother’s or cousin’s house while carrying a basketball he was left alone. Gangs even brutal ones tend to respect the kids who can use the game to get out of the neighborhood.

“I had a ball everywhere I went” he says. “It was my pass. Like ‘Oh he’s going to play basketball he’s just going to the court. If I didn’t have that ball I would’ve constantly been getting checked. I would probably have had to attach myself to a gang to protect myself. But I didn’t even play.”

It wasn’t until high school that he began to really take to the game. He was already 6ft 6in by the time he was in the 10th grade but he was raw: In his first game he scored on his own basket. But he started watching the pros more. His idol was Tracy McGrady who played for the nearby Orlando Magic. Sanders wore arm bands like him modeled his game after McGrady’s. He soon managed double-digit blocks. Later during his 11th and 12th grades his team was dominant in the region. And as a senior he started playing AAU traveling as far as Las Vegas for games. It was the people he met then that he bonded and later enrolled with at VCU.

Sanders’ college team was a force. During his three years there his squad won 75 games and only lost 27. After his junior year he decided to turn pro and he was selected by Milwaukee with the 15th overall pick. Had he stayed in college he would have played for the VCU team that made the Final Four under coach Shaka Smart. Still he was excited for the NBA. “You shoot a million jump shots and you want to get paid” he says. But in the end the NBA wasn’t what he’d hoped it would be. “It was a blessing but it was also a lot” he says. “I come from nothing and then you become the one that has everything. People who are supposed to guide you become your dependents. And you’re too young for that.”

Sanders lacked a support system in the league and his personal life. “You get fed to the sharks in a lot of ways” he says. “You can find yourself in a very vulnerable position … It can feel like a setup it can feel like a trap. I felt so alone. It was so hard to even express what I was going through. At the time in 2012 no one said they had anxiety or depression – maybe Delonte West but everyone was outcasting him.”

During his second year in the NBA Sanders smoked a joint for the first time passed to him by teammates. The drug helped like medicine. But league drug testing led to suspensions rehabs and ostracization. (Today the NBA doesn’t test for weed.)

“Do I gravitate to some pills and other drugs or do I do alcohol?” he wondered then about substances that wouldn’t be detected. Not only that but his need to be creative was no longer thriving. He felt stymied. “I was yearning for support yearning to be heard. But there was nothing in the manuscript for what I was going through at that time.” Sanders became one of the first players to talk about mental health – though now thanks to others such as DeMar DeRozan and Kevin Love it’s a much more accepted topic. However when you’re the first to do something you’re often judged harshly for it. “There was no way I was the first one [to have mental health issues]” he says. “But I was the first one to speak up.”

Today Sanders is glad he did. Not just vocally but by publicly stepping away from the game. That choice led to conversations people are having now. “I have three sons that could be in the NBA one day” he says. “To have their mental health be respected – sometimes you got to be the one to step out on a cliff. But it’s worth it.” It wasn’t that he didn’t love the game it was that he didn’t have what he needed while participating in it. “My body and my mind are elite” he says. “But my surroundings and my environment just wasn’t.”

When he decided to walk he had two kids and he knew that if he wasn’t in the right state of mind he couldn’t ensure they would be either. Later he went to another rehab facility. This time it wasn’t one selected by the NBA for marijuana – though even in those he made close relationships with patients who were there for additions to heroin and other narcotics. This one was designed around therapy and emotional wellbeing. That was the last facility he’s been to since.

After two years away from the NBA Sanders sought a comeback. He worked out for a few teams and landed a contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016-17 alongside LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. But he still had a rehab stint he’d have to undertake for the league if he was to stay on and the team at the time had its own internal turmoil he says. He lasted only a handful of games before he was waived. Leaving the NBA for good despite still being in his prime in his 20s brought a great deal of criticism. But Sanders doesn’t stress about those comments. His philosophy is that if someone isn’t going to be there at your funeral why care about what they say? “One minute you’re larger than life” he says. “And the next [in their eyes] you’re lower than dirt.”

Still at his peak Sanders who is a member of and continues to work with the NBA Retired Players Association was regarded my many as one of the best defensive players in the league. He was stopping his heroes in the paint players he’d idolized. “I was their nightmare” he says. “I was like ‘I can really play this game. This game is really meant for me!’”

It took a lot to walk away from that. But today though things aren’t always “perfect” Sanders maintains gratitude. He also retains his love of creativity: he has a production company and a publishing company. He’s writing a memoir kids’ books a movie script he runs camps produces music has a foundation and a cannabis line and he even spends summers playing in the Big3. Sanders also keeps relationships with players who deal with their own mental health issues.

“Why I go so hard” Sanders says “is because this has to be a success story. I got to show kids that I made the right choice. That there is a way – more for us to do. That we can be successful without succumbing. All the power’s in the present.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9jcnlwdG8tc2NhbS03MW0td2FsbGV0LWltcGVyc29uYXRpb24tZnVuZC1sYXVuZGVyaW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WBTC thief spreads $71M loot across multiple crypto wallets,"Stolen crypto funds linked to a recent $71 million wallet impersonation scam are on the move after six days of silence.

On May 3 an investor sent $71 million worth of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) to a bait wallet address falling victim to a wallet poisoning scam. The scammer created a wallet address with similar alphanumeric characters and made a small transaction to the victim’s account.

Like most investors the victim validated the wallet address by matching the first and last few characters and transferred 97% of their total assets to it. However the difference would have been noticeable in the middle characters often hidden on platforms to improve visual appeal.

Hackers often convert stolen crypto to Ether (ETH) which makes it easier to siphon via privacy protocols such as Tornado Cash — and this hacker was no different. The 1155 WBTC was immediately converted to roughly 23000 ETH and sat dormant in the scammer’s wallet for six days.

On May 8 blockchain investigation firm PeckShield noticed some of the stolen funds being laundered. The scammer started breaking down the loot into multiple parts and began sending it to multiple crypto wallets in parts.

The scammer used roughly 400 crypto wallets to dilute the stolen funds and reduce traceability. Eventually the funds in question ended up in over 150 wallets. However all the stolen funds can still be traced back to the unknown scammer at the time of writing.

A new type of scam allows bad actors to drain users’ wallets without transaction approval.

After the dull opening of Universal’s Fall Guy Jesus God Saint Mary and Joseph let’s hope those projections stay steady. Apes plans to pull in the under 35 guy demo in a way that Fall Guy did not. Presales stateside of around $3.1M in line with what was the 3-day of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning ($54.6M) indicate a $50M-plus debut. That start in U.S./Canada isn’t far from the $56.2M opening of Matt Reeves’ 2017 movie War of the Planet of the Apes and that would be considered solid. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ has the advantage that it’s opening at a time with less competition than War of the Planet of the Apes. This sequel which takes 300 years after the events of War of the Planet of the Apes is directed by Maze Runner filmmaker Wes Ball. No Rotten Tomatoes reviews yet.

The last three Planet of the Apes movies at 20th Century Fox the latter two directed by Reeves all received A- CinemaScore’s. The Tim Burton directed Mark Wahlberg starring 2001 version landed a B- grade.

The $165M production is booked at 3700-plus theaters boosted by a two-week Imax run and PLFs. The PG-13 movie has advance screenings in Imax and PLFs Wednesday at 7PM and on Thursday starting 3PM.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is rolling out in 100% of its offshore footprint this week beginning Wednesday in France Italy Germany and Korea. Majors joining on Thursday include the UK Brazil Australia and Mexico. China Spain and Japan follow on Friday.

Current projections for the frame are at $80M+ internationally. Broken out that’s $70M from overseas excluding China. That market is increasingly hard to call and is also coming out of a very prosperous five-day May Day holiday stretch which saw three local films excel. What happens with Kingdom will depend on how those hold up — note also that Saturday is a working day. China at this point should be $10M+.

Looking at comps and at today’s exchange rates 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes bowed to $62M internationally ($8M was from China). In 2014 Dawn of the Planet of the Apes did $127M ($37M in China) and 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes came in at a $130M launch ($56M from China).

The other advantage to those movies were that they had 3D whereas the Ball version does not.

Overall the latest rendition of the franchise tends to perform best in a mix of the mature European majors Mexico Brazil Australia and Korea. While we do expect Kingdom to land several No. 1 openings it is likely in some cases to be topped by the continued play of a strong local title (think Korea for example).

Overseas promotion included a launch event at the BFI IMAX in London on April 25 with Ball Freya Allan Owen Teague and Kevin Durand in attendance. Andy Serkis who memorably played Caesar in the first three films of the recent franchise was also out lending his support to this one.

The recent trilogy of Planet of the Apes movies from 2011-2017 grossed $1.68 billion at the global box office. The first movie based on Pierre Boulle’s novel launched in 1968 and grossed over $32M stateside unadjusted for inflation. Several sequels were spawned in the 1970s. Burton’s reboot only made $362M-plus at the global box office and did not trigger any sequels. All in The Planet of the Apes franchise has minted over $2.1 billion worldwide.

Briarcliff Entertainment has Not Another Church Movie in 1100 theaters this weekend stateside. Pic stars Jamie Foxx as God Mickey Rourke as the devil and Kevin Daniels.

Several Jewish students were outraged by the messages about genocide and freeing Palestine. Did this mean freeing the region from Jews? The expressions “Globalize the Intifada” “Glory to the Martyrs” and “Terror is justified as long as Palestine is occupied” indicated toleration if not support of Hamas an organization that justifies raping women and killing babies as long as you call them Jewish settlers. A few students showed up with an Israeli flag and were shamed on social media. Their counterprotest didn’t result in productive conversation alas. But it didn’t spill into violence either and my team did its best to make sure that was the case.

I’ve checked in with many Jewish students individually and sat down with a group to talk about their fears—and their complaints about faculty bias. Amazingly to them and to me a few professors took votes in their classes to decide whether they should hold class in the encampment. Minority rights? Not something these faculty seemed concerned with at least not until the provost reminded them that they could not force any student to support a cause with which the professor happened to agree. Of course faculty are free to support any cause they like but whatever political acumen they believe themselves to possess they are not free to impose this on their students. The Jewish students opposed to the protesters seemed glad to be able to talk openly about their concerns. I emphasized to them that I could not protect them from opposing views but that I could protect their safety and capacity to pursue their education.

There was some graffiti vandalism after the encampment settled in and we let people know that if that continued the university would have to step in. Fortunately that didn’t continue and so far almost all the protesters seem eager to find a constructive path: to make their arguments about divestment and about boycotts. They know that I have long been on record opposing these arguments but I will try to listen to them with an open mind. Ultimately it is the Board of Trustees that will decide about investment policy. Myself I am eager to find ways of supporting Gazan relief efforts and of doing whatever we can to promote a sustainable peace in the region that would acknowledge the rights of all parties. I’d like to think students know that."

What does that money buy?,"Oil and gas companies put thousands of dollars every year into New Mexico’s political campaigns on both sides of the aisle seeking to influence policy to protect continued growth in the industry that represents about a third of the state’s budget.

That amounted to about $1.1 million in political contributions between Oct. 5 2021 and April 4 per a report from New Mexico Ethics Watch leading up to the 2022 Mid-term Election.

The latest chunk of change came in a year when New Mexicans could choose a new governor and the three top candidates in that race were the state’s biggest recipients of oil and gas’ dollars.

Mark Ronchetti a former weatherman seeking the GOP nomination for governor got the most with $300000 coming to his campaign from oil and gas during the latest six-month reporting period read the report followed by Republican State Rep. Rebecca Dow with $122000.

While Republicans are typically viewed as the party with more support for oil and gas Democrat incumbent Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham was the third-highest recipient of oil and gas money in the state the report read with about $60000.

That means gubernatorial candidates got about $500000 almost half of the $1.1 million provide by oil and gas as the industry sought a seat at the table in the race for New Mexico’s highest-ranking political office.

""The oil and gas industry plays an outsized role in the economic fortunes of New Mexico and we believe citizens need to be aware of the industry's continuing influence upon our public officials” said Ethics Watch Executive Director Kathleen Sabo.

Spokesperson for Lujan Grisham's campaign Kendall Witmer denied that campaign donations from the oil and gas industry impacted the governor's decision making touting Lujan Grisham's record on environmental policy and

""Governor Lujan Grisham’s commitment to New Mexico is evidenced by her tireless work to make New Mexico a leader in economic growth by supporting legacy industries and investing in new ones leading the nation in tackling climate and clean energy technologies and investing resources in local communities"" Witmer said.

""Campaign donations have no effect on policy and to imply otherwise is a disservice to the groundbreaking work made by the Governor local public officials industry leaders and communities.""

Overall about 70 percent of oil and gas contributions went to Republicans per the report compared with 60 percent paid to the party in 2020.

That money came from some of the biggest oil companies in the world records show as they focus on the prolific Permian Basin in the southeast corner of New Mexico amid global supply shortfalls on the heels of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and growing demand as the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to subside.

Chevron led with $71000 in campaign contributions between October 2021 and April 2022 followed Artesia-based Santo Petroleum with $66000.

Occidental Petroleum was third with $60413 in contributions the report read and ExxonMobil was fourth with $60000.

Other top contributions from the oil and gas industry were JR Water Transfer’s $50000 NextEra Energy Resources’ $41500 and $37850 from ConocoPhillips.

Another $36200 came from Devon Energy followed by $35800 from the Trust of John A. Yates founder of Yates Petroleum and Marathon Oil Company with $30000 per the report.

Political Action Committees associated with oil and gas contributed another $51000 to the state’s political campaigns per the report while receiving about $260000 from the industry.

About $135000 of that was donated the report read to the New Mexico House Republican Campaign Committee.

In 2020 Ethics Watch reported New Mexico was the fifth-largest recipient of contributions from the industry.

Oil county Republicans support oil and gas' role in state politics

State Sen. David Gallegos of Eunice along New Mexico’s eastern border to Texas in Lea County of the oil-rich Permian Basin region said the industry deserves the influence it pays for as a major driver of the state’s economy.

“They’re a large donor to the state as a whole. What we do to oil and gas hurts everyone” he said. “I think it’s fair. We determine the fate of their industry or their demise. They’re a major player in the room and they deserve a major seat in the room.”

Gallegos said he was concerned the industry’s backing of Democrat candidates might not get the return he said oil and gas hoped for.

“If you butter both sides of the bread someone’s hands get dirty” he said. “I think they (oil and gas) are trying to put an investment in to protect themselves. I don’t think it’s really worked. On the Republican side we know the value of oil and gas.”

Artesia State Rep. Jim Townsend of Eddy County also in the Permian pointed to economic prosperity and jobs created by oil and gas in New Mexico arguing it's interests should represented as they mirror those of many New Mexicans.

""You’re talking about an industry that provides almost half to the state gross domestic product. It is a significant industry"" Townsend said. ""Oil and gas is a significant employer. The jobs of representatives and employers are to represent their districts.

""We are very fortunate to live in an area that is blessed with bountiful resources. We don’t have anything else that back-fill that.""

Is oil and gas threatened by government policy?

Critics of the industry questioned if the value oil and gas brought into New Mexico’s economy would truly be harmed by recent policy decisions.

More:COVID-19 recovery meant more oil spills in New Mexico study says. What can the State do?

A report authored by New Mexico economist Kelly O’Donnell analyzed the impact recently proposed reforms on federal oil and gas policy would have on the state’ revenue.

When he took office in 2019 the administration of President Joe Biden placed a moratorium on new federal oil and gas leases nationwide as the Department of the Interior conducted a review of its fossil fuel programs.

In the years since the DOI implemented policy shifts to account more for environmental and climate change impacts of extraction on public land.

More:Oil and gas flowing from Permian Basin on heels of COVID-19 Russia-Ukraine conflict

About half of New Mexico’s oil and gas operations occur on federal land and industry leaders were widely critical of the federal policy as threatening the state’s economy and its role in the nation’s energy security.

But O’Donnell in the report argued such policy shifts would have no bearing on oil and gas prices which drive production and revenue to the state.

Most of the provisions only apply to new leases the report read and 90 percent of New Mexico’s federal leases or already in production meaning any changes were unlikely to impact present operations.

An increase of federal royalties companies pay on their operations from 12.5 percent to 16.67 percent O’Donnell said would also only apply to new leases and have a “negligible” effect on production costs.

“Congress and the Department of Interior are weighing a variety of reforms that could impact operators on federal land in New Mexico however my analysis shows these impacts would be minimal to state revenue” O’Donnell said.

“Despite claims by the industry and its allies these reforms will have no impact on gas prices and pose little threat to oil and gas production in New Mexico which is expected to continue rising in the coming decade.”

FBC’s statement on the Mastercard security feature and limit reads as follows:

FBC Bank continues to transform with global e-commerce products and trends to ensure the provision of superlative service and the customer experience in a secured environment. The bank has over the years invested in robust security systems and continues to do so for the benefit of our customers.

To this end the bank is both an issuer and acquirer of the international MasterCard. The FBC MasterCard provides convenience to various market segments and is one of the most reliable cards on the market providing card users unmatched convenience during transactions on all enabled channels.

As technology has always had and will continue to have an ever-growing influence on payments we also note the growing sophistication of fraudsters using and operating the same technology which may subject our valued customers to financial prejudice emanating from hackers and fraudsters.

Fraudsters are always moving with technological advancements always exploiting means and ways of subverting payment platforms hence the need to also always ensure FBC customers are protected from such.

In the spirit of protecting its valued customers from hackers and fraudsters who are always on the prowl FBC Bank continues to put in place proactive interventions that protect and minimise the risk of financial loss for our customers.

The bank has taken note of potential loss points during online transaction cycles involving E-Commerce transactions that happen on websites. Generally these transactions are executed/processed after provision of card credentials which include Card Validation Value (CVV2) numbers. However on some websites mainly where subscription based payments are executed the transaction may go through without a request for your card CVV2 number. This leaves and provides an opportunity for hackers and fraudsters to compromise one’s card which may result in a financial loss to the card holder.

The bank has thus been proactive following this discovery and has placed a cap on the amount that a card holder can execute online without the need to provide a CVV2 number. To this end all FBC mastercard online transactions will be executed up to USD$60 (Sixty dollars) on all websites that do not request for CVV2 numbers. Where a cardholder has been restricted from doing a transaction above USD$60 they will be required to contact our contact centre for assistance.

Where a CVV2 number has been provided for amounts above USD$60 and transactions are still failing kindly contact us in order to verify if the merchant you are subscribing to is consuming the CVV number or is asking for formalities.

All other capabilities of the card remain unchanged. Card holders can still do withdrawals and Point of Sale transactions at all mastercard accepting ATMs and merchant locations respectively within the previously announced limits. Card holders are also encouraged to use the temporary block facility available on our MasterCard Mobile Application when cards are not in use

Protecting our customers from potential losses remains a key resolution of the FBC Brand our customers have invested a lot confidence in the brand and in-turn as a natural expectation we provide them with secure and convenient services that speak to their financial needs because they matter most",,,,,,,,,,,,
MTCH,Match Group,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA1LzA3L2NvdWxkc2hvdWxkLW1ldGEtcGxhdGZvcm1zLWJ1eS1tYXRjaC1ncm91cC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Should Meta Platforms Buy Match Group?,"Match Group is a rumored acquisition candidate. Could Facebook be the buyer?

A few weeks ago rumors were floated that the online dating conglomerate Match Group (MTCH -2.26%) could be a potential acquisition candidate with speculation pointing to the social media giant Meta Platforms (META 0.55%) as a possible buyer. While there hasn't yet been any proof to substantiate this rumor let's see whether this would be the right move for Meta and if it's even truly feasible.

What does Match Group do?

Before diving into how this acquisition could potentially benefit Meta it's probably best to understand what Match Group actually does.

Match Group is the leading provider of online dating apps globally. The company is home to popular brands like Tinder Hinge and Match.com but also continues to add more niche apps like Stir which is targeted toward the 20 million single parents in the U.S.

At Match Group dating apps benefit from being able to operate independently of one another while also having access to the expertise and best practices of other successful brands under the company's umbrella. Additionally back-office costs are offloaded to the parent company which means each app can be hyperfocused on the task at hand -- growing users and revenue. And that's exactly what they've done.

Led by its flagship app Tinder today Match Group touts just under 100 million monthly active users and 16.3 million payers across all of its brands. That's up from 60 million and 5.9 million five years ago. While part of this growth is certainly attributable to great execution Match Group has also been in the right place at the right time as online dating has become the number one way heterosexual couples meet in the United States. In fact since 2007 the percentage of couples in the U.S. that met online has grown from less than 20% to north of 40%!

Why should Meta Platforms buy Match Group?

In general online dating services function a lot like Meta's core family of apps -- Instagram Facebook and WhatsApp -- in that the larger the platform grows the more prominent the network effect becomes. In other words as more and more users join a certain app that app's value is enhanced by their presence making it more attractive to the next potential user. In turn the cost to acquire future customers shrinks increasing the app's profitability at scale. Simply put it's a wonderful business model.

One significant difference however is the revenue source. Although Match Group generates some advertising revenue from its various brands the lion's share of its sales comes from transactions in the form of subscriptions or a la carte purchases. Meta on the other hand generates the bulk of its revenue from advertising. While Match Group's revenue will likely always be more transactional simply due to the nature of online dating (higher intent less browsing) there'd certainly be some room for Meta to leverage its expertise and bolster Match Group's advertising revenue.

Then there's the metaverse angle. Given the company's name change Meta has now quite obviously altered its focus on building out its version of the digital world. And as it turns out Match Group has a metaverse component of its own. Though it's still early days the development team at Match Group's recently acquired Hyperconnect subsidiary has been working on a new immersive experience called Single Town. It's probably not too difficult to see how this could fit into Meta's ambitions.

Could it actually happen?

While there are definitely some compelling reasons for Meta to try to be the owner of Match Group whether it's actually feasible is another question entirely.

The first issue is the financial angle. With Match Group's stock having now fallen by more than 50% from its yearly highs the company's current enterprise value (market cap minus net cash) stands at about $25 billion -- or 26 times its trailing-12-month free cash flow -- which is less than Meta's net cash on hand. However in the most recent quarter Match Group's board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program amounting to almost $1 billion indicating that the company thinks its stock is worth more than it currently trades for. This means Meta would likely have to pay a significant premium to make the deal happen.

Nonetheless given that Meta generates almost $60 billion in annual operating cash flow it'd likely be able to raise the capital necessary to finance the deal. The regulatory side might be a little tougher.

It's no secret that Facebook and Meta's other complementary apps have been under the watchful eye of regulators in recent years after the company was fined $5 billion in 2019 for violating consumers' privacy. This heightened scrutiny even led U.K. regulators to block Facebook's latest social media-related acquisition of the GIF database company Giphy for less than $400 million. If Meta couldn't pass an acquisition that trivial I doubt regulators would feel too inclined to let Meta be the home of the world's leading matchmaking services.

Although I think it'd be a great acquisition candidate and an all-around sound business for Meta to tuck into its portfolio of subsidiaries the likelihood of the deal ever happening strikes me as quite low.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdGhld2Vlay5jb20vZmVhdHVyZS8xMDEzMjg3L3doZXJlLW1ham9yLWNvbXBhbmllcy1zdGFuZC1vbi1hYm9ydGlvbi1yaWdodHMtdGhlLXNjb3R1cy1sZWFr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where major companies stand on reproductive health care policies,"It's becoming increasingly difficult for companies to remain silent on controversial social issues — take the bitter LGBTQ-related standoff between The Walt Disney Company and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) as a recent example.

The latest blurring of the lines between business and politics however was sparked by the leaked draft majority opinion suggesting the Supreme Court is poised to overturn federal abortion rights as protected under 1973's Roe v. Wade. Here's where tech giants and leading businesses stand so far:

Airbnb: 'We will work to make sure our employees have the resources they need'

In a request for comment regarding the leaked opinion and its resulting expected effect on employee healthcare vacation rental company Airbnb told The San Francisco Standard that the company's ""healthcare coverage supports reproductive rights and we will work to make sure our employees have the resources they need to make choices about their reproductive rights as we committed to last fall"" in the wake of Texas' extreme six-week abortion ban.

Amazon: Up to $4000 a year in travel expenses

Amazon the nation's second-largest private employer has offered to cover up to $4000 a year in travel expenses for employees seeking non-threatening medical care including abortions if said care is unavailable within 100 miles of their residence and virtual care is not possible.

Apple: 'Actively monitoring the legal proceedings'

Tech giant Apple which has a large presence in Texas has said its health insurance covers both abortions and related travel fees. It appears Apple's policy has been in place since at least September 2021 when it confirmed to TechCrunch that it was keeping an eye on the legal challenges surrounding the Texas ban.

""We are actively monitoring the legal proceedings challenging the uniquely restrictive abortion law in Texas"" Apple wrote in an employee memo. ""In the meantime we want to remind you that our benefits at Apple are comprehensive and that they allow our employees to travel out-of-state for medical care if it is unavailable in their home state.""

Bumble and Match Group: 'We believe strongly in women's right to choose'

Online dating app Bumble commented on Monday's draft leak the following evening. ""The headlines today regarding the leaked draft opinion to overturn abortion rights in the United States are profoundly unsettling"" the company wrote on Twitter. ""At Bumble we believe strongly in women's right to choose and exercise complete control over their bodies.""

In September both Bumble and fellow dating app service Match Group separately announced they would each be launching relief funds for Texas employees in need of out-of-state abortion care. ""As I have said before the company generally does not take political stands unless it is relevant to our business"" Match Group CEO Shar Dubey said in a memo at the time. ""But in this instance I personally as a woman in Texas could not keep silent.""

Citigroup: A target of House Republicans

In March Citigroup became the first major bank to announce it would pay travel costs for employees affected by the abortion ban in Texas where it employs over 8000 workers. ""In response to changes in reproductive health care laws in certain states in the U.S. beginning in 2022 we provide travel benefits to facilitate access to adequate resources"" the bank said in a filing.

Citigroup subsequently came under fire for its decision; House Republicans urged the U.S. to cancel government contracts with the bank and a Texas lawmaker threatened to introduce a bill preventing Citigroup from underwriting municipal bonds.

CVS Health: 'We've made out-of-state care accessible and affordable'

In response to a request for comment on the draft opinion from Fortune CVS offered the following: ""We're monitoring the situation closely and evaluating how we can best support the coverage needs of our colleagues clients and consumers. We've made out-of-state care accessible and affordable for employees in states that have instituted more restrictive laws.""

Levi Strauss: 'Business leaders need to make their voices heard'

""Given what is at stake business leaders need to make their voices heard and act to protect the health and well-being of our employees"" Levi Strauss wrote in a statement released Wednesday. ""That means protecting reproductive rights."" The clothing brand is also reimbursing employees for travel expenses incurred while seeking health-care services unavailable in their state including abortions. Part-time hourly workers are able to seek reimbursement as well.

Salesforce: Helping employee families relocate out of Texas

Software company Salesforce offered in September to help employees and their families relocate out of Texas following the passage of its abortion law.

Salesforce did not take an explicit stance on the Texas law in its statement CNN noted at the time.

Uber and Lyft: Creating legal defense funds

Both Uber and Lyft each announced in September they'd be creating legal defense funds to help drivers sued under the Texas law which financially incentivizes and deputizes private citizens to sue anyone who aids or abets an abortion (including ride-sharing drives) after six weeks of pregnancy. Both companies recently extended the same coverage to drivers in Oklahoma.

Lyft also previously pledged to donate $1 million to Planned Parenthood. ""We've made our perspective on this quite clear"" Lyft co-founder and President John Zimmer told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday after the leak. ""So we will continue to look for ways to make a difference to speak out and to most importantly take action.""

UTA: 'The right to choose … has been a bedrock'

Hollywood's United Talent Agency also responded to the draft ruling by notifying its employees it would reimburse travel expenses related to reproductive health services unable to be accessed within their state. ""We're doing this to support the right to choose that has been a bedrock of settled law for almost half a century"" CEO Jeremy Zimmer said in a memo to employees. ""Several states have already introduced restrictive legislation and the draft Supreme Court ruling leaked yesterday if it comes to pass could make abortion illegal in more than half of the country.""

Yelp: 'Turning back the clock … will have a seismic impact'

Online review website Yelp has been outspoken in its opposition to an overruling of Roe warning such a decision from the court would have a ""seismic impact on our society and economy.""

""Turning back the clock on the progress women have made over the past 50 years will have a seismic impact on our society and economy"" Yelp continued in its statement on the matter. ""This goes against the will of the vast majority of Americans who agree that decisions around reproductive care should be made by women and their doctors."" The company also called on Congress to codify Roe into law.

Prior to the Monday evening leak Yelp had announced it would be covering expenses for employees and their spouses who must travel out of state for abortion care. The policy arrived in response to a restrictive six-week ban out of Texas but the benefit extends to employees in other states as well. Mirian Warren the company's chief diversity officer has said Yelp is not concerned about backlash.

Per a Wednesday report from The New York Times businesses who appear yet to directly comment on the draft ruling include PricewaterhouseCoopers Oracle JP Morgan Chase Walmart Disney ThirdLove Patagonia Kroger and Meta (though Sheryl Sandberg did post on Facebook writing that ""this is a scary day for women all across our country"").

It seems Microsoft has also stayed silent on an expected Roe reversal though company co-founder and billionaire Bill Gates weighed in on Twitter:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vdGhpbmdzLXd3ZS13YW50cy1mb3Jnb3R0ZW4tYWJvdXQtdGhlLXNoaWVsZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Things WWE Wants You To Forget About The Shield,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vdGhpbmdzLXd3ZS13YW50cy1mb3Jnb3R0ZW4tYWJvdXQtdGhlLXNoaWVsZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHA6Ly9lbmdsaXNoLm5ld3MuY24vMjAyMjA1MDgvMjdiYzc1NjdkNmQ0NDAzYmFhYTM4YTEwOTZjYTA2MDgvYy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China sweep Australia to begin defense of Uber Cup,"Chen Yufei of China competes against Hsuan-Yu Wendy Chen of Australia during the singles match of Group B at the Uber Cup badminton tournament in Bangkok Thailand May 8 2022.

Olympic medallist PV Sindhu Aakarshi Kashyap and Ashmita Chaliha won their singles matches while the pair of Tanisha Crasto and Treesa Jolly won the doubles match for the women’s team in the Uber Cup.

The doubles pair of Simran Singhi and Shruti Mishra was the only Indians to lose a match on the day.

PV Sindhu a former world champion played the first match for India against Canada’s highest-ranked player Michelle Li. The world No. 7 PV Sindhu began the match strongly despite some resistance from the 11th-ranked opponent.

The second game however was dominated by PV Sindhu who went on to win the contest 21-17 21-10 in just over a half-hour to give India a 1-0 advantage in the five-match tie.

Pan American Games doubles champions Rachel Honderich and Kristen Tsai then levelled the tie after defeating the young Indian duo of Simran Singhi and Shruti Mishra 21-19 21-12 in 36 minutes.

India’s Aakarshi Kashyap and Canada’s Wen Yu Zhang contested the third match. Aakarshi Kashyap one of India’s top players on the domestic circuit kept her nerves to win the contest 17-21 21-18 21-17 and helped India reclaim the lead.

The make-shift pair of Tanisha Crasto and Treesa Jolly then claimed the fourth match of the tie by defeating Catherine Choi and Josephine Wu 21-9 21-15 and gave India an unassailable 3-1 lead.

Ashmita Chaliha up against fellow youngster Rachel Chan went down easily in the first game but mounted a gritty comeback. Trailing 4-8 Ashmita amped her pace to pocket the second game 21-11. In the decider Ashmita Chaliha trailed 15-9 before storming back into the match and winning it 12-21 21-11 22-20.

The Indian women will next play the USA in Group D on Tuesday and are likely to progress to the last eight if they win the tie.

Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casey leads GOP rival in Pennsylvania Senate race: Poll,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4630466-pennsylvania-senate-bob-casey-david-mccormick/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTkvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvZGF2ZS1tY2Nvcm1pY2stZmFybS1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This G.O.P. Senate Candidate Says He Grew Up on a Family Farm. Not Exactly.,"David McCormick’s origin story goes something like this: He grew up in rural Pennsylvania southwest of Scranton. He baled hay trimmed Christmas trees and otherwise worked on his family’s farm. And from those humble beginnings he rose to achieve the American dream.

“I spent most of my life in Pennsylvania growing up in Bloomsburg on my family’s farm” Mr. McCormick now a Republican candidate for Senate told Pittsburgh Quarterly in 2022.

“I’ve truly lived the American dream” he wrote in a fund-raising appeal in October. “My life’s journey — from growing up on a farm in Bloomsburg to graduating from West Point and serving in the 82nd Airborne Division growing a business in Pittsburgh and serving at the highest levels of government — reflects that.”

“I grew up on a family farm from the time I was a kid” he said at the Pennsylvania farm show in January.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3RydW1wLWJpZGVuLW1jY29ybWljay1jYXNleS1zZW5hdGUtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXByaW1hcnktMTI0ODRlNjVhNjhmNDM2NGZlYzUxZWM1ZDQ2MGU1MzjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casey and McCormick to face each other as nominees in Pennsylvania's high-stakes US Senate contest,"HARRISBURG Pa. (AP) — Democratic Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger David McCormick will face each other in Pennsylvania’s high-stakes U.S. Senate contest this fall as Tuesday’s primary election put the men on track for a race that is expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars and help decide control of the Senate next year.

Casey and McCormick won their respective party primary contests after they were uncontested and now enter what is likely to be a grueling expensive and hard-fought 2024 general election campaign that culminates in the Nov. 5 vote.

Casey seeking his fourth term is perhaps Pennsylvania’s best-known politician and a stalwart of the presidential swing state’s Democratic Party — the son of a former two-term governor and Pennsylvania’s longest-ever serving Democrat in the Senate.

McCormick is a two-time Senate challenger a former hedge fund CEO and a Pennsylvania native who spent $14 million of his own money only to lose narrowly to celebrity heart surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz in 2022’s seven-way GOP primary. Oz then lost to Democratic Sen. John Fetterman in a pivotal Senate contest.

This time around McCormick has consolidated the party around his candidacy and is backed by a super PAC that’s already reported raising more than $20 million much of it from securities-trading billionaires.

What to know about the 2024 Election

Democracy: American democracy has overcome big stress tests since 2020. More challenges lie ahead in 2024.

The Associated Press is the most trusted source of information on election night with a history of accuracy dating to 1848. Read the latest: Follow AP’s complete coverage of this year’s election.

McCormick’s candidacy is shaping up as the strongest challenge to Casey in his three reelection bids. McCormick has worked to shore up support in the GOP base and on Tuesday night hammered his message at his election night gathering in Pittsburgh that Casey is a do-nothing senator.

“We’re now turning to the general election and here’s the truth: Pennsylvania deserves better than Bob Casey You deserve better” McCormick said. “Bob Casey’s defining achievement in his political life 30 years in political office has been to be the son of Bob Casey Sr. That is what defines his political career.”

Casey in Washington on Tuesday to cast votes in favor of $95 billion in war aid to Ukraine Israel and Taiwan said on social media that “there are 196 days until the general election and we’re going to win.” Meanwhile the state Democratic Party unveiled a minute-long digital ad slamming McCormick as a “millionaire hedge fund executive who is lying to Pennsylvanians.”

The Senate candidates will share a ticket with candidates for president in a state that is critical to whether Democrats can maintain control of the White House and the Senate.

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump won their party nominations easily after all major rivals dropped out. Both men made campaign trips to swing-state Pennsylvania in recent days and voters can expect to see plenty of them their TV ads and their surrogates campaigning over the next six months in a state that swung from Trump in 2016 to Biden in 2020.

Of note however could be the number of “ uncommitted ” write-in votes cast in the Democratic primary to protest Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war.

In the Senate contest Democrats have attacked McCormick’s opposition to abortion rights his frequent trips to Connecticut’s ritzy “Gold Coast ” where he keeps a family home and the focus on investing in China during his dozen years as an executive at the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates including as CEO.

Casey has been a key player for Democrats trying to reframe the election-year narrative about the economy by attacking “greedflation” — a blunt term for corporations that jack up prices and rip off shoppers to maximize profits — as fast-rising prices over the past three years have opened a big soft spot in 2024 for Democrats. Indications that the U.S. economy avoided a recession amid efforts to manage inflation have yet to translate into voter enthusiasm for Biden.

McCormick meanwhile has accused Casey of rubber-stamping harmful immigration economic energy and national security policies of Biden and made a bid for Jewish voters by traveling to the Israel-Gaza border and arguing that Biden hasn’t backed Israel strongly enough in the Israel-Hamas war.

Casey is one of Biden’s strongest allies in Congress. McCormick and Trump have endorsed each other but are an awkward duo atop the GOP’s ticket after Trump savaged McCormick in 2022’s primary in a successful bid to lift Oz to his primary win.

Democrats currently hold a Senate majority by the narrowest of margins but face a difficult 2024 Senate map that requires them to defend incumbents in the red states of Montana and Ohio and fight for open seats with new candidates in Michigan and West Virginia.

A Casey loss could guarantee Republican control of the Senate.

Elsewhere on the ballot Tuesday Pennsylvanians decided nominees for an open attorney general’s office and two other statewide offices — treasurer and auditor general — plus all 17 of the state’s U.S. House seats.

For attorney general Republicans nominated Dave Sunday York County’s district attorney in a two-way race while Democrats nominated former state Auditor General Eugene DePasquale of Pittsburgh in a five-person primary field.

Democrats also nominated Erin McClelland a two-time congressional candidate in suburban Pittsburgh who has helped run various human services organizations to challenge Republican state Treasurer Stacy Garrity and they nominated state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta of Philadelphia to challenge Republican state Auditor General Tim DeFoor. McClelland prevailed despite being heavily outspent by her party-endorsed rival.

For Congress 44 candidates were on ballots including all 17 incumbents. All three incumbents facing primary challengers — Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick in suburban Philadelphia and Democratic Reps. Dwight Evans in Philadelphia and Summer Lee in a Pittsburgh-based district — won their races.

Lee’s primary against challenger Bhavini Patel has shaped up as an early test of whether Israel’s war with Gaza poses political threats to progressive Democrats in Congress who have criticized how it has been handled.

Republicans nominated state Rep. Ryan Mackenzie in a three-way race to challenge Democratic Rep. Susan Wild whose Allentown-based district is closely politically divided while Democrats nominated former TV news personality Janelle Stelson from among six candidates to challenge Republican Rep. Scott Perry in a Republican-leaning district in southern Pennsylvania.

Perry has become a national figure for heading up the ultra-right House Freedom Caucus during a speakership battle and his efforts to help Trump stay in power after losing the 2020 presidential election.

SOPA Images / Getty

How do you know when your customers really really need your product?

Too often their greatest need may come at the worst time for you.

Perhaps you're not open. Perhaps you're too busy. Or perhaps you just don't realize how great their need truly is.

When for example will you need a Big Mac the most?

When you're hungry certainly. But also perhaps when disaster strikes and your options have dwindled toward the unacceptable.

McDonald's has found an ingenious way to satisfy customers' needs at precisely this moment.

May I present the McDelivery Detector?

The idea is blessedly simple. Should you be the sort of home cook who frequently fails at home cooking you can apply for one of these gadgets.

As its name implies it's a smoke detector. The ingenious part however is that it doesn't just detect an excess of smoke. It instantly texts you to ask whether you'd prefer to have McDonald's delivered to you right away.

The clue perhaps lies in the McDetector's shape. It looks just like a Big Mac. A plastic upside-down Big Mac.

You'll be delighted too to know that this thing is 3D printed IoT inspired and when smoke is detected you hear the famous McDonald's musical signature.

Rarely has disaster come with so much modern joy.

You might think this is all a small frivolity. A stunt to capture attention. You'd be right.

The McDetector is only available in the Netherlands for this promotional idea emerged from McDonald's Dutch arm.

Surely though many people all over the world would adore having one of these things permanently installed in their homes as a savior for their cooking blunders?

Cooking can be hard. McDonald's is always easy. This marvelous use of technology makes it easier still. The McDetector could even become a selling point embraced by realtors and home stagers.

This house doesn't merely have smoke detectors. It has McDetectors.

I imagine McDonald's sales and marketing departments might be frothing about this idea.

Which fast-food brand wouldn't adore a permanent presence in the home an upside-down burger hanging on the ceiling gnawing at your appetite 24 hours a day?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vc29yYW5ld3MyNC5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8wNy9hbWVyaWNhbi12aXNpdHMtamFwYW4td29uZGVycy13aHktbWNkb25hbGRzLW9ubHktc2VsbHMtYmVlZi1ib3dscy1ub3QtYnVyZ2Vycy_SAXRodHRwczovL3NvcmFuZXdzMjQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvMDcvYW1lcmljYW4tdmlzaXRzLWphcGFuLXdvbmRlcnMtd2h5LW1jZG9uYWxkcy1vbmx5LXNlbGxzLWJlZWYtYm93bHMtbm90LWJ1cmdlcnMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American visits Japan wonders why McDonald’s only sells beef bowls not burgers,"A visit to this unusual branch reveals the mystery behind the burgerless McDonald’s.

As fun as it is to try the local cuisine when travelling abroad sometimes we can’t resist stepping into a foreign McDonald’s to see what the differences are with the way things are done back home.

One American visitor recently did just that making a brief stop at the golden arches after arriving in Japan and what they found on the menu was something you won’t find at a McDonald’s anywhere in the world.

According to this visitor the McDonald’s they ate at had no burgers on the menu at all. In fact nothing about it was familiar as the only thing on the menu was gyudon (beef bowls).

▼ Gyudon is definitely something you wouldn’t expect to find at McDonald’s.

Associate professor and Twitter user Tomoki Ozawa (@oz_tomoki) recently recounted the story on Twitter saying the American visitor had asked her why Japanese McDonald’s only had beef bowls. The visitor went on to say that they asked the clerk if they had burgers to which they said they didn’t so it all became a puzzling experience.

As regular readers of our site will know McDonald’s does indeed sell burgers and lots of them so naturally Ozawa was confused by what had happened. However after asking the visitor which McDonald’s they visited the reason for the confusion became clear.

▼ This is the McDonald’s they visited.

As you can see there are two restaurants here and they both bear the same colour scheme. There’s the McDonald’s on the left with its red sign and yellow “M” and right next to it is a restaurant with the same red-and-yellow colours across it and a lot of Japanese writing.

At a quick glance first-timers might think the cohesive colour scheme signifies that the restaurant on the right is also a part of McDonald’s especially if you’re not familiar with Japanese chains and don’t understand the language. However once you’ve been here awhile you’ll know that this is definitely not the sign for McDonald’s — this is a branch of Sukiya one of the country’s leading beef bowl chains.

▼ Sukiya

So what had happened was the new-to-Japan visitor had mistakenly walked into Sukiya looking for burgers thinking it was a McDonald’s. No doubt the staff were just as confused as the customer was in their search for burgers but many online could sympathise with the situation.

“If I couldn’t read Japanese it’d be easy to think this was McDonald’s just in terms of colour.”

“It’s hard to understand the difference at first glance!”

“With a location like this the Sukiya staff should’ve realised what was happening.”

“The clerk should’ve guessed and told them to go upstairs!”

“If you don’t know Yoshinoya and Sukiya you wouldn’t be able to tell it’s a gyudon restaurant.”

So next time you see two stores that look alike in Japan you might want to give them a closer look to check you’re going into the right one. And if all this talk of beef bowls has made you hungry for gyudon there are not one but three Japanese chains that deserve your attention!

Chrissy Teigen is no stranger to McDonald's. As the former face of their Dollar Menu she has discussed being a huge fan of the Sausage McMuffin with Egg having chicken nuggets at night and dipping her fries in a McFlurry (Spoon University). But she also has a not-so-secret love affair with the regular McDonald's cheeseburger. She even bulk-buys them. Yes you read that right. Why would anyone want extra burgers?

After all cold or even slightly cooled fast food conjures images of nightmare scenarios. As time passes crispy French fries might morph into salty sticks of Styrofoam and your burger could grow slick with grease. You're almost tempted to abandon your plans to eat your Big Mac combo at home and devour it in the parking lot instead. If only you hadn't just had your car detailed and all the stray pickles and lettuce vacuumed up.

The thought of heating up your meal in the microwave might provide little consolation as you fear what the warmed-up final product will be like. Will your burger dry up into the culinary equivalent of a slab of cardboard pressed between a pair of earmuffs? Or will it get slimy turning the bun into sponges bursting with saturated fat? It turns out that you need not worry about nuking your burger at least as far as Teigen is concerned. You just need the right burger and the proper technique."

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

Vyjuvek is a topical gene therapy for dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa an inherited disorder causes painful blisters and persistent wounds.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results."
META,Meta Platforms,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA1LzA3L2NvdWxkc2hvdWxkLW1ldGEtcGxhdGZvcm1zLWJ1eS1tYXRjaC1ncm91cC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Should Meta Platforms Buy Match Group?,"Match Group is a rumored acquisition candidate. Could Facebook be the buyer?

A few weeks ago rumors were floated that the online dating conglomerate Match Group (MTCH -2.26%) could be a potential acquisition candidate with speculation pointing to the social media giant Meta Platforms (META 0.55%) as a possible buyer. While there hasn't yet been any proof to substantiate this rumor let's see whether this would be the right move for Meta and if it's even truly feasible.

What does Match Group do?

Before diving into how this acquisition could potentially benefit Meta it's probably best to understand what Match Group actually does.

Match Group is the leading provider of online dating apps globally. The company is home to popular brands like Tinder Hinge and Match.com but also continues to add more niche apps like Stir which is targeted toward the 20 million single parents in the U.S.

At Match Group dating apps benefit from being able to operate independently of one another while also having access to the expertise and best practices of other successful brands under the company's umbrella. Additionally back-office costs are offloaded to the parent company which means each app can be hyperfocused on the task at hand -- growing users and revenue. And that's exactly what they've done.

Led by its flagship app Tinder today Match Group touts just under 100 million monthly active users and 16.3 million payers across all of its brands. That's up from 60 million and 5.9 million five years ago. While part of this growth is certainly attributable to great execution Match Group has also been in the right place at the right time as online dating has become the number one way heterosexual couples meet in the United States. In fact since 2007 the percentage of couples in the U.S. that met online has grown from less than 20% to north of 40%!

Why should Meta Platforms buy Match Group?

In general online dating services function a lot like Meta's core family of apps -- Instagram Facebook and WhatsApp -- in that the larger the platform grows the more prominent the network effect becomes. In other words as more and more users join a certain app that app's value is enhanced by their presence making it more attractive to the next potential user. In turn the cost to acquire future customers shrinks increasing the app's profitability at scale. Simply put it's a wonderful business model.

One significant difference however is the revenue source. Although Match Group generates some advertising revenue from its various brands the lion's share of its sales comes from transactions in the form of subscriptions or a la carte purchases. Meta on the other hand generates the bulk of its revenue from advertising. While Match Group's revenue will likely always be more transactional simply due to the nature of online dating (higher intent less browsing) there'd certainly be some room for Meta to leverage its expertise and bolster Match Group's advertising revenue.

Then there's the metaverse angle. Given the company's name change Meta has now quite obviously altered its focus on building out its version of the digital world. And as it turns out Match Group has a metaverse component of its own. Though it's still early days the development team at Match Group's recently acquired Hyperconnect subsidiary has been working on a new immersive experience called Single Town. It's probably not too difficult to see how this could fit into Meta's ambitions.

Could it actually happen?

While there are definitely some compelling reasons for Meta to try to be the owner of Match Group whether it's actually feasible is another question entirely.

The first issue is the financial angle. With Match Group's stock having now fallen by more than 50% from its yearly highs the company's current enterprise value (market cap minus net cash) stands at about $25 billion -- or 26 times its trailing-12-month free cash flow -- which is less than Meta's net cash on hand. However in the most recent quarter Match Group's board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program amounting to almost $1 billion indicating that the company thinks its stock is worth more than it currently trades for. This means Meta would likely have to pay a significant premium to make the deal happen.

Nonetheless given that Meta generates almost $60 billion in annual operating cash flow it'd likely be able to raise the capital necessary to finance the deal. The regulatory side might be a little tougher.

It's no secret that Facebook and Meta's other complementary apps have been under the watchful eye of regulators in recent years after the company was fined $5 billion in 2019 for violating consumers' privacy. This heightened scrutiny even led U.K. regulators to block Facebook's latest social media-related acquisition of the GIF database company Giphy for less than $400 million. If Meta couldn't pass an acquisition that trivial I doubt regulators would feel too inclined to let Meta be the home of the world's leading matchmaking services.

Although I think it'd be a great acquisition candidate and an all-around sound business for Meta to tuck into its portfolio of subsidiaries the likelihood of the deal ever happening strikes me as quite low.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhaXBlaXRpbWVzLmNvbS9OZXdzL2Zyb250L2FyY2hpdmVzLzIwMjIvMDUvMDcvMjAwMzc3NzgzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta launches Asia's first XR hub in Taipei,"Meta launches Asia’s first XR hub in Taipei

Staff writer with CNA





Meta Platforms Inc yesterday launched Asia’s first physical hub for extended reality (XR) research in Taiwan as Facebook’s parent company seeks to promote the immersive technologies.

At the “Meta XR Hub Taiwan” launch ceremony in Taipei Meta head of agency for greater China Stephanie Chu (朱怡靜) described Taiwanese partners as an important cornerstone of technological development.

“Today marks another milestone of Meta’s establishment in Taiwan and [the company] will work with Taiwanese partners to create the next generation of social technology” Chu said.

Taiwan is to play a huge part in the metaverse Meta chief product officer Chris Cox said in a video presentation at the event.

Taiwan’s ability to build hardware and establish public infrastructure is unparalleled and it has many outstanding creators artists researchers and developers engaged in the development of technologies and applications he said.

As augmented reality and virtual reality flourish Taiwan would not only become an important stronghold for the metaverse team but also a key hub for driving global innovations he added.

American Institute in Taiwan Director Sandra Oudkirk said that by establishing the XR Hub in Taipei “Meta is demonstrating its belief that Taiwan will play a key role in the rapidly evolving metaverse industry.”

“Taiwan is a central node of the globe’s semiconductor ecosystem and a cutting-edge pioneer on emerging technologies like hardware-software integration chipsets processors 5G and Wi-Fi 6” Oudkirk said.

Taiwanese developers and artists have also won global awards for creating virtual reality content she said and “these are all essential elements in the metaverse.”

The XR hub in Taiwan is to collaborate with Taiwantrade to establish a platform in which people can digitally engage with each other so that trade exhibitions would not be just limited to a physical or online event.

Taiwantrade is an interactive electronic business portal operated by the government-sponsored Taiwan External Trade Development Council.

President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) said at the ceremony that the government would work hard to build a better environment for the development of the digital economy and expressed hope that Meta can continue to expand its investments in Taiwan.

Tsai said that the metaverse taking root in Taiwan would help drive local communication technology development and innovative applications and prompt more companies to accelerate their participation in the metaverse.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvMDgvbWV0YS1pcy1vcGVuaW5nLWEtc3RvcmUtYXMtdnItaGVhZHNldC1zYWxlcy1tYWtlLXBsYXktZm9yLW1haW5zdHJlYW0uaHRtbNIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIyLzA1LzA4L21ldGEtaXMtb3BlbmluZy1hLXN0b3JlLWFzLXZyLWhlYWRzZXQtc2FsZXMtbWFrZS1wbGF5LWZvci1tYWluc3RyZWFtLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta is opening its first store as VR headsets inch closer to mainstream reality,"In this article META Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT

A good number of teenagers have virtual reality headsets but have they starting using them in a way similar to smartphones? So far the answer is no. One-quarter (26%) of teens say they own a virtual reality headset a level of VR device ownership that is higher than many expected but with just 5% of teens saying they use the technology on a regular basis the level of engagement remains ""uncompelling"" according to the recently released Piper Sandler research report ""Taking Stock with Teens: Spring 2022."" Usage of VR headsets is low due to a number of factors from costs yet to come down into the range of most consumers to an insufficient range of applications. But the latter shouldn't present a problem to the eventual rise of a VR-enabled metaverse since the metaverse may very well be the solution to that adoption problem. In terms of applications there really isn't that much out there yet certainly nothing that has captured major interest. Gaming already at $200 billion in annual revenue with an estimated three billion players globally is a natural on ramp for Gen Z and subsequent generations who will have exclusively grown up in the digital world. It is a target of Meta's big tech rival Microsoft which is spending close to $70 billion to acquire Activision Blizzard. A recent study of Gen Z gamers by Razorfish and Vice Media Group found that 20% of their entertainment/leisure budgets will be earmarked for in-game purchases over the next five years. But to date there are only a small number of VR games (just 3% of users on the popular gaming platform Steam have a VR headset). Concerts and sports also have significant potential but no real driver yet exists for either of these. Even education where immersive class ""field trips"" to anywhere in the world are part of the collective imagining about VR's benefits has yet to take off in significant ways. The metaverse is certainly the biggest application space for VR on the horizon so perhaps the ""Field of Dreams"" approach — if you build it they will come — can work. Certainly Facebook parent Meta Platforms is betting on it as part of efforts to diversity beyond the ad revenue from its Facebook family of apps including the core app Instagram and WhatsApp which accounted for 97.5% of revenue in the most recent quarter close to $28 billion. ""Everybody's talking about the metaverse"" Nicola Mendolsohn Meta's global business vice president told CNBC from the sidelines of the Milken Institute Global conference last week. But the revenue contribution for its Reality Labs division – the part of the company that's designing products for the metaverse — was $695 million. Reality Labs remains a money sink if a big bet on the future for the company posting a loss of $2.96 billion in the first quarter results compared with a loss of $1.83 billion in the first quarter of 2021. Executives indicated the while expenses will come in a little lighter than previous expectations this unit will continue to be an area of expense growth. The company has devoted over $10 billion to build the metaverse. The cycle between investment and ""meaningful enough revenue growth"" to be profitable is going to be long according to the company. ""I think it's going to be longer for Reality Labs than for a lot of the traditional software that we've built"" Mark Zuckerberg Meta CEO said on the recent earnings call. ""We are making large investments to deliver the next platform that I believe will be incredibly important both for our mission and business comparable and value to the leading mobile platforms today. Now I recognize that it's expensive to build this. It's something that's never been built before.""

Amid the heavy spending some experts say it's possible that a major breakthrough occurs soon. There has been significant innovation in VR already says Sarah Ostadabbas assistant professor of electrical & computer engineering at Northeastern University so much so that she thinks widespread adoption may indeed be ""just one or two killer applications away."" ""With high latency and poor headtracking previous VR was basically useless"" she said and added that Oculus has ""already overcome these biggest limiting factors."" On Monday Meta will open its first physical store and showroom for VR headset technology where customers will be able to purchase the Quest 2 headset. It is also gearing up for a higher-end headset currently referred to as Project Cambria and to be released later this year. A case can be made that given these tech advancements the design side is where there is room for growth a territory usually owned by Apple (long rumored to be developing a headset). ""It's been rumored for years that Apple will release industry-disrupting AR/VR hardware"" said David Lasala team lead interactive development & XR technology at New York University. But he says among active players right now the clear front runner is the Meta (formerly Oculus) Quest 2. The second would probably be the Valve Index. Other headsets of note include the Lynx and Pico Neo. Also worth mentioning: Pimax Varjo HTC Vive and there are still some Windows Mixed Reality activities. But since Meta isn't primarily a hardware company there is significant freedom in the niche to let the best VR developments be used. ""I think they want to build the platform (OS)"" Ostadabbas said. ""Google got scared when Meta and other social networks locked them out so they jumped on cellphones to avoid being kept out of these major sources of information. Similarly Meta has found out the hard way what smartphone providers can do to hurt their business model with one policy change."" Recent privacy restrictions on ad targeting from Apple and Google smartphone operating systems have cost Meta billions in ad revenue. The company's CFO estimated the Apple changes could cost it $10 billion in revenue this year.

There are cautionary tales about owning the hardware such as Google Glass which has found only limited enterprise and industrial applications to date and 3-D televisions. Zuckerberg said on the last earnings call that ""the best experience will be on virtual and eventually augmented reality platforms and especially on our platform like Quest"" but he added that the company plans to make it easy for people to enter the metaverse from more platforms and ""even without needing a headset."" Whoever wins the hardware battle if the tech works for consumers there's still the question of what people are going to actually be doing in the metaverse and really what's the point of all of it? Skeptics see hype and rebranding and not much beyond that. A lot of the hype can be cut through by one word: presence. ""Aside from the immersivity one of the most interesting differences between the metaverse and the internet is presence — your avatar"" Ostadabbas said. While sitting in a meeting in the shape of a purple octopus may seem silly (because it is) there is something to be said for the underlying concept. ""The internet is a source of information and people explore massive amounts of information without ever leaving a mark. Until you comment you are invisible. With the metaverse your avatar means that consumption requires presence and so even exploration is active and interactive"" she said. With presence comes Meta's other promise (pulled along from its Facebook days): community a word that has seen a lot of its meaning devalued by social media but there is promise here too within the metaverse in the shape of community without any constraints as to real world geography. Most community building throughout life is tied for the most part to a fairly thin range of possibilities (school on one side of thirty work on the other). ""In the best scenario someone figures out how to recreate this community experience in the metaverse and people's lives are improved through a greater sense of belonging"" Ostadabbas said.

Meta's Metaverse platform Horizon Worlds grows: Meta integrates the event app ""Venues"" into Worlds.

Venues launched back in 2018 long before Horizon Worlds then called Oculus Venues for Oculus Go. The app later came in an improved version for the first Quest. The social VR environment is related to Horizon Worlds in style and function: cartoon-style avatars move through a 3D environment and can interact with each other.

While users can engage in many activities in Worlds Venues is all about events - mainly video streams of comedy performances sporting events concerts movies and so on.

Venues merges with Worlds

Back at the beta launch of Horizon Worlds 2020 Meta fundamentally overhauled the event platform in the style of Worlds. Now Meta announces that Venues will be completely merged into Worlds in the near future. The standalone Venues app (see trailer) will be discontinued on June 6.

According to Meta Venues will become a standalone world in Horizon Worlds. Venues and Worlds will be connected through portals that will allow users to seamlessly switch between game social and event environments.

Meta puzzles its way to the Metaverse

Meta's biggest and most expensive VR event in venues to date was a live-streaming concert by rock band Foo Fighters to coincide with the Super Bowl last February. However the event struggled with technical issues and was also optimized for traditional 2D screens instead of VR.

Other building blocks of Meta's Metaverse vision include Horizon Home the virtual living room and Horizon Workrooms. These too will likely be merged into worlds at some point. That would be in line with the vision of a seamless all-encompassing Metaverse as described by Jason Rubin Metaverse manager at Meta in 2018. Rubin is responsible for the Metaverse content strategy at Meta.

Currently Horizon Worlds is only available in the US and Canada. According to Meta other countries will gain access starting this summer. Germany is not expected to be included as Meta does not sell the Quest 2 VR headset in Germany due to a conflict with the Federal Cartel Office.

From next month Venues will have its own dedicated space in Horizon Worlds thereby expanding the metaverse platform.

Venues began in 2018 even ahead of Horizon Worlds. It was initially known as Oculus Venues for Oculus Go. The app was further improved for the first Oculus Quest headset. The Venues social VR environment is similar in style and function to Horizon Worlds and involves cartoon-like avatars moving about in a 3D environment and even capable of interacting with one another. Horizon Worlds is an all-encompassing VR universe that accommodates wide-ranging activities while Venues is specifically for events which mostly includes video streams movies comedy performances concerts or sporting events. Horizon lets you discover new places and experiences with your friends create your own unique worlds and even form teams to compete in action-packed games.

By creating dedicated spaces for Venues inside Horizon World users on the metaverse will now be able to catch up on their favorite marquee shows ranging from concerts to live sporting events or even meditation sessions and comedy clubs. They will even be able to host their meetups inside Horizon Worlds.

Venues programming inside Horizon Worlds will be open to all users over 18 in the US and Canada from June 6. Users who are not in the US and Canada or who are aged 13 to 17 will lose access to Venues programming once the standalone Venues app is retired on June 6. However the users will still be able to access highlights as well as replays of the events in Venues on Oculus TV.

Meta says access to Horizon Worlds will be expanded to additional countries this summer enabling more users outside the US and Canada to build their own metaverse worlds make new virtual reality friends and access the lineup of Venues programming inside Horizon Worlds.

Meta’s biggest and most expensive Virtual Reality event in Venues to date has been a livestreamed concert by the rock band Foo Fighters which happened at the Super Bowl last February. However the Venues app has been plagued with technical and was optimized for the conventional 2D screens rather than for virtual reality.

Apart from Venues and Worlds Meta’s metaverse vision also includes other building blocks such as the Horizon Workrooms and the Horizon Home living room. Sooner or later expect these services to also be merged into Horizon Worlds thereby contributing to Meta’s vision of a seamless and comprehensive metaverse."

Ten firms – holding nearly 94 per cent of the life fund in Bangladesh’s insurance industry – are dominating the sector staying ahead of the curve by providing superior customer service and settling insurance claims on time.

An analysis of the Insurance Development and Regulatory Authority (IDRA) data shows that the sector’s life fund was Tk 35889 crore at the end of December 2021. Among the 33 insurance firms ten held Tk 33671 crore in their life funds at that period.

These ten firms are – MetLife Bangladesh National Life Insurance Delta Life Insurance Jiban Bima Corporation Fareast Islami Life Insurance Meghna Life Insurance Popular Life Insurance Prime Islami Life Insurance Sandhani Life Insurance and Pragati Life Insurance.

According to IDRA data multinational company MetLife grabbed the top position in 2021 with Tk 15356 crore in its life fund which is 42.78 per cent of the total figure. National Life Insurance is in second place with Tk 4384 crore which is 27.59 per cent.

Meanwhile Delta Life Insurance came in third with Tk 3834 in life fund (10.68 per cent) followed by Jiban Bima Corporation with Tk 2304 crore (6.41per cent).

Fareast Islami Life Meghna Life Popular Life Prime Islami Life Sandhani Life and Pragati Life had Tk 1975 crore Tk 1891 crore Tk 1755 crore Tk 809 crore Tk 753 crore and Tk 610 crore in their life funds respectively.

A look at past 5 years

According to the annual reports of life insurance firms the sustainability of life fund earnings has increased gradually. The life funds of all life insurance companies in 2017 2018 and 2019 were Tk 30887 crore Tk 32493 crore and Tk 34400 crore respectively.

In 2020 the amount of life funds stood at 36108 Tk crore which dropped to Tk 35889 crore at the end of 2021 marking a decrease of Tk 219 crore.Life fund is the amount that any company gets from premium earnings after paying all expenses and insurance claims. As per regulations insurance companies have to invest 30 per cent of their life funds in government treasury bonds every year for risk management.

Insiders say the top ten companies are dominating the industry by providing superior customer service especially by paying insurance claims on time developing fresh products and offering modern insurance policies.

Providing more details IDRA Executive Director and spokesperson SM Shakil Akhter said “Some companies are doing very well because they are focusing on upholding the customers’ trust. MetLife is particularly well-reputed for their various modern policies and customer service.

“Similar to MetLife a number of other local companies have also developed a stellar reputation among their customers. Maybe this is why they are doing pretty well in the life insurance industry.”

MetLife Bangladesh’s Head of Communications Saif Rahman said “We are pledge-bound to serve our customers. They trust us because of our long standing track record of providing good service and keeping our promises.

“Ensuring a good business practice is helping us stay ahead of others in the life insurance industry.”

Why are others lagging behind?

Discussing the industry National Life Insurance’s Chief Executive Officer Md Kazim Uddin said “Achieving and maintaining public trust is the most essential component of the life insurance sector. People currently lack trust in this industry.

“The key reason behind this issue is the companies who unnecessarily delay paying insurance claims. But some firms are upholding their hard-earned reputation by paying insurance claims on time. This has helped their business get ahead of the competition.”

He continued “The majority of life insurance companies are not paying claims. When a company refuses to fulfill ten customers’ claims they share their negative experience with a thousand others.

“Companies upholding their reputation through good customer service are doing well and those failing to do so are losing customer trust.”",,,,,,,,,

Caesars Entertainment spinoff VICI Properties said April 29 that it completed its $17.2 billion buyout of MGM Growth Properties the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. The deal was first announced last August and included the assumption of about $5.7 billion of debt.

As part of the sale VICI acquired several MGM Resorts-operated properties along Las Vegas Boulevard including Mandalay Bay MGM Grand The Mirage Park MGM New York-New York Luxor and Excalibur.

It also picked up several other casino properties outside Nevada including MGM Grand Detroit and MGM National Harbor near Washington D.C.

All told VICI is slated to receive more than $1 billion in initial annual rent from the newly acquired properties the firm indicated.

The buyout likely won’t result in noticeable changes at the resorts anytime soon as VICI does not operate the properties but rather collects rent from the companies that do.

Still it easily ranks among the largest real estate sales the Strip has ever seen and significantly expands VICI’s holdings in the famed casino corridor making the New York company one of the biggest property owners on Las Vegas Boulevard.

VICI now owns 10 resorts on the Strip totaling almost 41000 hotel rooms 1.2 million square feet of casino space and 5.9 million square feet of meeting and convention space company President and Chief Operating Officer John Payne said in a news release.

Company CEO Ed Pitoniak said the deal makes VICI the largest owner of hotel and conference real estate in America.

MGM Resorts which spun off MGM Growth in 2016 and was its controlling shareholder received about $4.4 billion in cash as part of the VICI buyout according to a company news release.

Operations at MGM Resorts-run properties now owned by VICI ""will continue as before for guests and employees"" MGM spokesman Brian Ahern told the Review-Journal.

NEVADA REGULATORS OK COMPANY BUYING CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT

MGM will use proceeds from the deal to invest in its ""core business"" President and CEO Bill Hornbuckle said in a May 2 earnings call adding the company would also ""continue to seek meaningful growth opportunities.""

MGM announced it is offering $607 million to buy LeoVegas a Swedish online gaming firm. It also is in the process of buying the operations side of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas for more than $1.6 billion; will begin spending on a new resort in Osaka Japan later this year; and plans to build a 1000-room resort in the United Arab Emirates.

VICI was spun off from Caesars Entertainment in 2017 as the casino chain’s main operating unit emerged from bankruptcy. By the end of that year VICI’s real estate holdings on the Strip consisted of Caesars Palace and Harrah’s a securities filing shows.

People come to Las Vegas for a lot of reasons. Some come for conventions. Some come for the magic shows Cirque du Soleil or Celine Dion. A lot of people come to gamble. Some come purely for the spectacle of it all. But everyone who comes to Las Vegas knows about the buffets.

Those legendary Las Vegas buffets — with everything from salad to sirloin — fuel the trips of more than 42 million visitors per year. Caesars Palace’s Bacchanal Buffet alone offers more than 500 food items serving more than 3500 visitors daily. The buffets are “all you can eat” but not all is eaten. Inevitably some of that food goes to waste.

And that is a microcosm of what happens at the national level. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture about 30 percent to 40 percent of the U.S. food supply is wasted. Some of that waste is caused by food spoiling but the vast majority of it is food that was purchased but not eaten like the food presented on display at Las Vegas buffets.

Food waste creates myriad economic challenges including the expense and labor involved in producing the food in the first place the fuel and transportation costs of getting it from farm to market the costs of handling and selling the food and finally the value of the food product itself. The USDA estimates the true cost of food waste at about $218 billion per year.

Simply put: Food waste as a category is a large and growing contributor to the detrimental impacts of waste on the environment and the economy. It also impacts world hunger.

Although the United States currently produces twice as much food as it needs to serve its 330 million citizens according to analytics firm SAS roughly 54 million people in the U.S. are food-insecure. In Nevada alone there are more than 373000 people experiencing food insecurity many of them children.

Las Vegas produces more than 5 billion pounds of waste per year. Most of that waste — food and all — ends up at the landfill. If all of that wasted food made its way to food pantries or shelters there would not be any hunger. The food exists to solve that problem but instead of going to good use it goes to landfills.

Given the vast amounts of food produced in Las Vegas at its more than 40 buffets and more than 4000 restaurants it is without a doubt one of the leading contributors to the abundance of food waste in the United States. The Strip alone has more than 30 resorts each with restaurants and many with buffets. Each produces food waste.

One novel method of diverting this waste from landfills in Las Vegas is the pig farm. Resorts such as Aria Bellagio Luxor and The Venetian send mountains of food waste to Las Vegas Livestock about 30 miles northeast of the city. There the farm’s 4000 or so pigs eat roughly 20 tons of food waste per day — all from the Strip. But that 20 tons is only part of the problem.

The true magnitude of the food waste epidemic in Las Vegas is likely unknowable. But given that Las Vegas consumes nearly 30 tons of shrimp per day alone the total amount of food consumed — and wasted — is colossal.

Pigs alone will not solve this problem. Las Vegas as a global leader in hospitality must commit to a more sustainable solution for dealing with food waste. More of it must be diverted from landfills and less of it must be created in the first place.

Food waste is a problem with economic societal environmental and moral implications. We must come together to resolve this crisis.

But just the pools themselves were open absent the wild party scenes (or with toned-down parties at best).

But this year the parties are back in full force. Gone are restrictions that allow only hotel guests to use a casino pool and many are now open to the public for swimming or partying — but be prepared to pay for the privilege. These pools will be hopping all summer long as part of Las Vegas’ vibrant “daylife” scene: Aliante Aria Bally’s Circa Cosmopolitan Downtown Grand Encore Flamingo Golden Nugget Green Valley Ranch JW Marriott Luxor Mirage M Resort Mandalay Bay MGM Grand Park MGM Planet Hollywood Red Rock Resorts World Sahara Sunset Station The Cromwell The LINQ Tropicana Venetian and Virgin. If you don’t see your resort on the list don’t worry. All the casinos have pools for their guests they just aren’t all open to the public.

Toptional: This year six Las Vegas pools are classified as “toptional” meaning topless sunbathing is allowed (if not encouraged) — Artisan Encore (XS) The STRAT (Wet24) Mandalay Bay (Moorea) Mirage (Bare) and Wynn (Sunset). Most charge admission fees for nonhotel guests.

Blackjack: If you want to play live blackjack by the pool there are six casinos to choose from: Cosmopolitan Encore Flamingo Golden Nugget Mandalay Bay and Tropicana (swim-up blackjack coming soon).

Question: What’s being built in the corner of the CityCenter complex on the south Strip?

Answer: It’s a four-story retail center tentatively called Project63. The topping off ceremony took place last month one year to the day after the close of the sale by MGM Resorts of the two-acre property previously occupied by the failed Harmon condo tower. Project63 is on schedule to welcome its first tenants in October with the complex completely built out by February.

Story by Cassandra Cousineau and Alan Snel/Photos by J. Tyge O’Donnell

The Las Vegas Aces took the floor at Mandalay Bay Sunday for their first home game of 2022 with owner Mark Davis’ overhaul complete of the business side of the operations.

High-profile coach Becky Hammon started her era as the Aces’ leader with a decisive win in Phoenix two days ago while the Aces’ new general manager Natalie Williams saw the team she has assembled play its first 2022 game at the Michelob Ultra Arena on the Strip.

The Aces defeated a very competitive Seattle team 85-74 in the team’s home-opener. Seattle led by a point entering the fourth quarter but the Aces’ up-tempo style took its toll on the Storm and Las Vegas secured its second win to open the new season with an 11-point win before a loud and rowdy crowd of 6212.

Davis started the business overhaul with the hiring of Nikki Fargas as team president. Fargas in turn recruited Hammon to take over for former coach Bill Laimbeer.

Under Fargas the Aces have beefed up their marketing staff. The Aces enlisted former University of San Francisco women’s basketball coach Jennifer Azzi as chief business development officer and Blair Hardiek as chief marketing and communications officer.

LVSportsBiz.com interviewed Davis before the game about the Aces’ business hires.

Davis said it’s a “women’s league” but the women were hired on the business side because they were the best people for the job.

We were picking the best people and the results will speak for themselves — Las Vegas Aces owner Mark Davis

Hiring Hammon also has business implications because she has mass appeal to both women and men fans because of her coaching cred in the NBA as an assistant coach with the San Antonio Spurs.

Before the game Davis was joined by former MGM Resorts International CEO Jim Murren who spearheaded MGM Resorts’ purchase of the WNBA team in San Antonio and moved the franchise to Las Vegas where it was rebranded into the Aces in 2018.

Murren told LVSportsBiz.com that Davis has “elevated (Aces) to another level.”

In turn Davis said Murren and MGM Resorts created “a great foundation to build on” for the franchise.

Murren also met up with Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak who is quite the sports fan.

Davis sat courtside with Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak and the Aces CEO Larry Delsen who is a close Davis friend and CPA who has advised the Davis family on accounting issues. Delsen’s son Matt now works as chief operating officer/chief financial officer for the Aces. And Sisolak’s daughter Carley is also on the Aces staff as marketing director. Take a look:

Fargas said she learned even more about marketing the WNBA from ESPN when she served as a commentator during ESPN’s coverage of the women’s college basketball tournament.

Fargas now in her second year with Las Vegas spoke with LVSportsBiz.com about her optimism for the new season.

“We are excited about our draft picks. We feel we have a strong nucleus returning and we added a few pieces to the puzzle to put us back into the championship picture” Fargas said.

She added “Our general manager Natalie Williams has done a phenomenal job in a short period of time.”

*

This is no longer Laimbeer’s team. It’s a Hammon team that plays with more pace speed and quickness.

After the Aces’ win Hammon also praised the defensive work of A’ja Wilson the team’s foundational player. Hammon said Wilson was one of the best defensive players in the WNBA.

In response Wilson quipped “I hope coach Staley heard that.”

By the way Wilson even nailed a three-point shot against Seattle. And chances are good you will see more long-range shooting from the Aces this season.

Your game summary here. Notice all five Aces starters in double figures with Young Hamby Wilson and Plum all logging more than 34 minutes of playing time. Breanna Stewart scored 21 to lead Seattle.

*

The Aces took the fewest number of 3-point shots and made the second-least shots from beyond the arc of any team in the WNBA last season.

With former Aces center Liz Cambage gone Hammon has turned the Aces guards loose while making the three-pointers a part of the game plan.

To do that Las Vegas pursued more shooters and four out of the five Aces draft picks were intended to fortify Hammon’s vision.

Fargas remarked how much she liked the versatility of the draft. However Mya Hollingshed Khayla Pointer along with undrafted rookie free agent Nancy Mulkey have since been waived.

With former center Liz Cambage no longer on the Aces the WNBA team looks to play faster with a more up-tempo style under Hammon.

The Aces have former league MVP Wilson as its foundation with former sixth-women-of-the-year winner Dearica Hamby and Plum playing bigger roles on the team the Las Vegas team poured in 106 points in its season-opening win over Phoenix. You might recall the Mercury ended the Aces’ title hopes last season in the WNBA semis.

Wilson stuck around after the game to greet 100 kids who were treated to free tickets courtesy of the Aces’ popular All-Star player. Here’s Wilson at the meet-and-greet in the arena.

He definitely misses the white ultra-modern building on 12 Hamaskit Street in Herzliya proudly displaying the famed Apple logo.

Srouji 58 senior vice president of hardware technologies at Apple is the world's top Israeli tech executive and arguably the most influential figure at the company second only to its CEO Tim Cook. He holds a golden share in this building – the Israeli Apple R&D center. Steve Jobs himself along with Tim Cook decided to found the company's first R&D center in Israel which had originally been proposed by Srouji and former Motorola executive Bob Mansfield who had also worked extensively with Israelis.

Apple's R&D center officially opened in March 2012 and next month it celebrates a decade of operations. ""We employ the best of the best"" says Srouji. ""We've built a world class team and have made several acquisitions.""

What started with one employee - Aharon Aharon Srouji's lecturer at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology who after being appointed CEO tasked Srouji with turning the concept into reality - is now a vibrant center employing a staff of 1800 taking credit for some of Apple's most outstanding recent innovations.

Due to Apple's famous culture of compartmentalization and secrecy the Herzliya center's exact fields of activity have over the years remained undisclosed deliberately dropping vague hints such as ""There's something Israeli in every Apple device"".

The Israeli R&D center's extraordinary achievements over the past two COVID-filled years have earned Apple unprecedented profits and have helped propel the center's value to almost three trillion dollars. In this time cracks have formed in Apple's famed wall of secrecy.

After years of the company using very general terms in interviews in his spacious office at the Apple Park (the ""spaceship campus"") in Cupertino California Srouji now tells us why he calls himself a ""very proud father"" of the Israeli center and how his personal role models in Israel and growing up in Haifa in the 1980s have shaped his life.

The jewel in Apple's crown over the last two years - taking even the experts by surprise - are three new strong ultra-fast M1 Mac processors. Based on the technology that runs Apple's smartphone processors (ARM) both fell under Srouji's sole responsibility and have replaced the old Intel processors which were unceremoniously discarded.

Last October Apple unveiled their flagship M1 max and the M1 pro processors providing the world's best performance for personal computers. It can now be revealed that the two chips already in use in the most powerful Macs were developed behind a veil of secrecy in Israel.

""These are two very complicated chips. The M1 max has 57 billion transistors. Both were developed in Israel"" says Sarouji. ""Building the chip assimilating it its physical design validation [testing the behavior of the chip] – was all conducted in Israel. And they're really great.""

""By no coincidence the Max and the Pro were launched at the same time as our competitor Intel's new Alder Lake Core 12 processor which was also developed in Israel. So the crème de la crème of the world's computer processors are made in Israel.""

They were developed during COVID. How did you overcome limitations posed by the pandemic?

""It was very challenging. We were past the research and development stage and we were waiting for a chip to arrive for the validation stage - a long and comprehensive series of tests. Then suddenly COVID hit. It created enormous problems as we need physical access to the laboratory with several engineers in the same room. Nonetheless the teams in Israel and the United States didn't miss a single development stage.

""Time differences between Israel and America mean that we were already used to working remotely. We developed creative tools for remote-working even for the laboratories. I'm very proud of the devotion and sacrifice made by engineers both in Israel and in the United States. I worked with them on the chips both and remotely and in person. The collaboration was truly inspiring.""

I'm guessing that the center in Israel is responsible for more innovations over the past decade.

""I can't talk about everything but let me give a few examples. Let's start with what's already been announced: Every storage controller in every Apple product comes from Israel. It started before we opened the R&D center with the acquisition of Anobit - our first Israeli company"" he says.

""People store their memories and pictures on iPhones and iPads so we wanted to speed up the storage access cut down energy use while securing the memories for life so that people won't be losing pictures. Anobit had a very skilled team experienced building storage controllers based on Flash memory (SSD). They built our storage controllers. Nine months after the acquisition they'd already made the first storage controller that went into a Mac which we've adapted for iPhones iPads and other devices.

""A few years later in Israel we acquired a very small team to develop WIFI and Bluetooth capability for the Apple Watch. We then decided that the watch's electronic brain the SOC would be developed in Israel so the team in Herzliya built that too.""

Former CEO Aharon Aharon explained that the Apple Watch development was kept secret to such an extent that when it was launched it came as a surprise even within the company. Aharon served as CEO until 2017 when he left to assume the role of CEO of the Israel Innovation Authority (previously known as the Office of the Chief Scientist).

He learned the culture of secrecy the hard way: ""At the beginning it was difficult to recruit. Apple would open up something in Israel but wouldn't say what it was. At first even I didn't know what was going on in Israel"" says Aharon.

Rony Fried has been running the center since 2017 doing his best to operate beneath the radar.

According to Srouji ""In 2013 we acquisitioned PrimeSense specializing in camera depth sensors the technology facilitating unlocking the iPhone using facial recognition (Face ID). Our developers are presently working on sophisticated machine learning and imaging solutions.""

""The core technology for Lidar (sensor determining ranges using laser reflection) which we integrated into iPhones and iPads is also from Israel. Cinematic Mode focusing video first used in the iPhone 13 is based on part of the same technology.""

Let's get back to founding the center. Both you and Bob Mansfield were familiar with the Israeli mentality. Weren't you concerned with the ""It'll be OK… "" mindset which is so different from the Apple DNA?

Srouji laughs… ""I’m Israeli. I was born in Haifa. I'm very much aware of all of this. We had a number of reasons for thinking of Israel.""

""Firstly Israel really is Start Up Nation. There are lots of ideas and creative innovations here. It's heavily ingrained into the culture industry and good universities. If you're looking for a high concentration of talent and great engineers – this is the place to find them"" he says.

""Secondly when we look for dedication commitment and loyalty to the employer Israel does very well.

""We'd created a base in Israel and then we started building on that one step at a time. We gradually took on more assignments and despite various obstacles the teams executed them all.""

Aharon adds that ""It wasn't easy. Altering habits took some time. It took six months to integrate Anobit which came from the Israeli Start-Up culture… At Apple everything is planned and focused.""

Srouji has been in the United States for twenty years - with a two-year break – fourteen of those years with Apple. He's married to Radha from Fassuta a Christian Arab town in the Galilee and the couple have three adult children. The family lives in the neighborhood of Almaden near the Apple Park in Cupertino California.

With his brother he attended the École des Sœurs de Nazareth High School a leading private school near his home in Haifa. Although there was no computer in his home on Abbas Street in the 1980s Srouji completed both undergraduate and masters programs at the Technion with distinction.

He worked at the IBM plant in Haifa for three years before joining Intel in 1992. A 2015 profile article in Calcalist quoted a former Intel colleague: ""After only a week we were enchanted by him. He's an unusually modest quiet hardworking polite man but also the type who'll with a big smile on his face get up to help out. He was the perfect teammate never acting superior although he was clearly more talented that the rest of us.""

In 1999 Srouji relocated to Austin Texas to work at the city's Intel plant where he spent three years. In 2005 he returned to the United States to work at IBM. He joined Apple in 2008 shortly following the launch of the first iPhone. Jobs soon made the decision that would boost Srouji's career: After 15 years of using Intel's microchips in their devices Apple would start developing their own.

11 View gallery The Apple A10 Fusion 64-bit chip ( Photo: Apple )

Could you give me some idea of the extent of this project?

""It was a very important strategic decision. It usually takes three to four years to produce a microchip bringing it from conception to the marketing stage. Microchip design is unforgiving. You're not targeting what the market presently needs but rather what will be happening years from now"" he says.

""In 2010 we decided in principle that for our software we needed our own hardware including our own chips. This is very much what Apple is about and we want to keep it that way. We want the best performance we can get not to match our competitors but rather to achieve more.

""We understood that Apple could create the best processors graphics digital imaging processing for cameras video simulation for video encoding as well as the best security – all on one chip. Launching the first independent iPhone chip in 2010 we felt we had a strong foundation. Eventually we thought it was time we develop our own for chip for the Mac.""

From 2011 Srouji headed developing the processors for the first iPhone and iPad. In 2017 Apple revealed that that his annual salary had reached $24 million second only to Angela Ahrendts the company's senior vice president of retail and double that of Cook. In case you were concerned Cook's annual salary last year was $100 million.

In 2016 Bloomberg magazine ran a cover page article titled ""The most important Apple executive you've never heard of"" claiming that he saved the company in 2015 by managing to develop the processor for the iPad Pro six months ahead of schedule.

About schedules - the iPhone 12 was launched a month late due to supply problems resulting from COVID. The iPhone 13 was launched on time. How do you overcome supply chain problems and a global microchip shortage?

""We work with our own microchip manufacturers such as TSMC in Taiwan producing 5 nanometer chips. We have a world class technology team working with them. Development including verification validation and mass production is all planned years ahead. Nothing's left to the last minute"" he says.

""Despite supply shortages and the slight delay of the iPhone 12 launch 2021 was one of Apple's best years with a revenue of $123 billion with Apple shares increasing in value by 1200% over the last decade.""

You mention the best engineers in Israel and the United States but engineers are in short supply both in these countries and in Europe. How do you overcome this?

""This is true. We work tirelessly on this front"" he says.

""Firstly both in Israel and America we approach colleges and universities helping them build study programs or supplying guest lecturers. We sometimes even provide them with our own engineers to teach certain lessons. We want students to be enthusiastic about the challenges of developing microchips. I think it's the most exciting kind of work there is but I'm biased.

""Secondly there sometimes aren't enough computer science or electrical engineering university graduates but there are graduates in related fields such as physics and mathematics so we train them so that within a couple of years they can become engineers at Apple"" he adds.

""Thirdly Apple values include diversity and equal opportunities. In Israel we're training Ultra-Orthodox women and Arab engineers encouraging them to integrate into the tech sector.""

11 View gallery iPad Air ( Photo: Apple )

Are you happy with the number of Israeli Arab joining Apple in Israel?

""I'm always aiming for more but looking at the numbers it's good. We can definitely strive to do better but I think we're working correctly. It's very much part of what Apple is about – we want good diverse talent.""

Don't you feel you're a bit late in virtual worlds such as Metaverse? Is Apple planning anything in virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR)?

""I can only say that we very feel that virtual and augmented reality are exciting and very important. Over a billion Apple devices on the market are ready for AR.""

What about the iPhone battery that hardly lasts the day?

""This is very complicated. When you design a battery you want it to have the optimum energy within a given size what we call 'volumetric energy density.' It also needs to last as long as possible be secure and provide constant power supply"" he says.

""We need to think about the device and its electronics. The more energy it saves the longer it lasts. How the energy is supplied from the battery to the phone also matters. I have a team of great chemists addressing this issue.""

You can't argue with success. Apple's sales have never been better. Users however are saying that although the products are good it's ""more of the same"" and that the magic from the Steve Jobs days has long gone that it's not exciting anymore.

""I hope you'll like our products. I believe we are creating that magic in every device we make. Let me give a few examples: Firstly – the AirPods with their amazing sound quality and background noise cancellation.

""Secondly – the Apple Watch – just look at where we started and where we are now. Not only is it a wonderful watch it's also a great health device measuring heart beats and ECG. It can be can used as a telephone and for making payments. We improve this device every year. I think that's magic.

""Thirdly what we've done with the M1 processor is magic. When we get this level of horsepower on a laptop or even a PC with great battery life that's magic. We're also working on future technology and products. We really want to carry on surprising people enrich their lives and make them happy.""

In February 2015 three years after opening the R&D center in Herzliya the Apple CEO visited Israel. Srouji accompanied him always trying to keep a low profile even when visiting then-President Reuven Rivlin who exclaimed: ""We are very proud of the Israeli that is one of the major figures in your company… we need five or six more Johnnies."" Cook responded: ""If you find them let me know where they all are.""

Do you think growing up in Israel has helped you in your career?

""I truly believe that the values we grow up with that we bring to our adult lives along with the people from whom we learn definitely affect our lives and careers. I was born in Haifa – a beautiful city with the Carmel and the beaches. Its real beauty however is its tolerance and human diversity. The city is home to a broad range of ethnic and religious groups living in an unusual harmony. Growing up in this kind of environment is part of who you are.

""I was also very lucky to be born in a city offering such good education. I went to an excellent school and then to the Technion. Again I'm biased but I think the Technion is a world class academic institution when it comes to engineering"" he says.

""In Israel I learnt a lot especially how to think and approach difficult problems. Learning is important but learning without in-depth thinking won't take you far in life. You need both – how to think about and deal with things that you haven't encountered before.

""What you learn from people you grow up with is also important. I had a lot of role models both in Israel and America but let's stick to the role models in Israel: As a child my first role model was my headmistress an Irish nun. She was strict and meticulous earning the respect of both pupils and staff. She'd enter a chaotic noisy classroom and suddenly the class would go quiet. This was simply out of our respect for her.

""My father an artisan carpenter who made foundry molds for metal casting served as a further role model. He'd make large wooden molds into which molten liquid metal would be poured to make steel parts for the defense industry.

""He was the best in his profession and there were very few like him. The interesting part is that he charged less than he should even when he challenged with particularly difficult almost impossible tasks because he just wanted to do it. From him I learnt about dedication and creativity"" he adds.

""In the 1980s the Technion provided me with a further role model: I had a teacher who was a Unix operating system genius. After hours he headed his own independent data center at the Technion. His class was the hardest so I challenged myself to do well in this class. I wanted to be like him. From him I learnt about technical depth and how to truly devote yourself to something.

""My final role model is one of my first bosses. He understood people and could 'read' them after a single handshake. He was a great teambuilder and recruiter who knew how to push engineers to work their hardest. He was also an inspiring figure a person you wanted to follow. From him I learnt to surround myself with clever people and how to inspire and motivate others to do things they don’t think they can do.""

BOISE Idaho — Boise State University celebrated its 110th commencement ceremony at Albertsons Stadium with more than 20000 people in attendance.

The ceremony honored 3109 Boise State undergraduate graduate and doctoral students earning their degrees. Nearly 2400 students attended the ceremony on the blue turf the largest graduating class in Boise State History.

""You are no stranger to difficult times"" Boise State University President Dr. Marlene Tromp said. ""Remember graduates as you set your course to make your unique mark on the world: courage isn't being unafraid it is moving ahead even when you are facing a wall of fear.""

The new graduates are joining a community of more than 100000 living alumni. Combined the graduating class earned 3733 degrees or certificates with 1400 of those degrees and certificates being completed with honors.

""Today I challenge you in periods of hardship to keep going to keep growing to take on the next challenge and the next one"" Dr. Tromp said ""I want to tell you that you can take your unique knowledge and talents that combination of qualities that only you can bring and make your extraordinary destiny. Take this opportunity seize it with joy and gratitude for the way hardship has prepared you to do more. Broncos this is your charge: go out there and make your mark! We're counting on you and we'll be watching!""

Other milestones this spring include Boise State's 90th anniversary the 50th anniversary of the first master's degree awarded and the 25th anniversary of the first doctoral degree awarded.

It made them angrier,"A good start but a bad way to sell it? Getty Images

You can't please everyone.

Have you ever tried it? Have you ever tried to spend even a day attempting to please everyone you come into contact with?

You always always end up annoying someone. Because that's how people are.

Microsoft however is coming from behind on this one. It's made far too many people angry far too many times with far too little justification.

So even as it's greatly improved its behavior since Satya Nadella became CEO the company doesn't always seem as prepared to handle flak as it might be.

When Windows 11 came along there were outcries. Many were concerned about the Start menu suddenly being perched in the middle of the screen. It isn't; moreover it's so customizable.

Most people have perhaps become used to it. Many even like it. But there's clearly a concentrated cabal of users whose feelings lurch toward detestation. Microsoft seems unable to let them just be.

It's what you wanted. Really.



Windows Latest reports that Redmond has recently been contacting Windows 11 insiders who participate in the Release Beta and Dev channels.

The essence of the company's email seems to be: ""Yo what up? You know the new Start menu was created after all y'all gave your feedback right?""

Clearly the words were slightly more formal. Microsoft did however also enclose a YouTube video explaining the new Start menu's genesis.

An almost year-old YouTube video.

Oh that may reek slightly of ""Come on dolt. Haven't you got with the program yet?""

The video itself features many wise creative types explaining in wise but simple terms how they were clever and creative.

It begins with a user researcher called Dragana musing: ""The process of designing is informed by research. It's a challenge of making sense of it.""

People don't really know what they want. Even if they think they do they might not always be able to explain it.

Shortly we meet another user researcher -- how many worked on this thing? Ashley explains: ""It's really easy to design something you like but that doesn't necessarily mean it will work for everyone.""

There it is. The everyone word. This is what Microsoft was striving for. This is the basis of pain.

Enter the designers. They talk about how they listened more. They explain how they asked a lot of questions. One example: ""Should Start be left-aligned or center-aligned?""

Of course it could be left to you to align it but that apparently wouldn't work for everyone.

You the people. We believe in democracy.



And then another designer this one called Ryan reveals what he and his team did. He says they made a big decision: ""Let's let people tell us how they would want to put it all together.""

A dangerous maneuver this. Imagine if Steve Jobs had asked people how they'd like the iPhone's home screen arranged. Imagine his patience at sifting through the suggestions.

At Microsoft they think different. The company's research apparently showed that Windows users ""were creating designs that matched what we were already thinking about.""

I wonder if the company recruited some of them.

Was it wise of Microsoft to include this video in its email? Might it have been better to include of video of real users explaining why they like the Windows 11 Start menu so much?

The year-old video had sat there largely unnoticed. Now however it's adorned with the recent comments of the unhappy.

Sample: ""They proceed to literally ignore everything what people is asking for and they do whatever they want or like. No one likes the new start menu even less the taskbar.""

No one? Could that be the case?

There was more: ""How can so many companies claim that they are hearing users' feedback when they are explicitly not doing it? Is this the world we live now? Pretty boring if they think we are that stupid.""

Do companies think people are stupid with the same vehemence as say politicians do? I doubt it.

Some people it seems are far happier with of all things Windows 10.

""The new taskbar is a joke"" says one.

He wasn't alone. Take this: ""Finally MS got it right from the Windows 10 start menu so it decides to make a new menu for Windows 11 that only caters to a small group of users. Do as you like but leave the option for the US to get the Windows 10 menu back even with unanimated tiles.""

Why so negative? Because you asked.



To Microsoft's credit it kept the YouTube comments open something Apple would never do. Well Microsoft apparently likes listening to user feedback. However it can't have been easy to wade through the plethora of negativity.

Many pleaded for the return of customization. There was more pungent commentary too.

Sample: ""Don't patronize your users. You didn't listen to anyone who said 'this is a fundamentally flawed design' 'we want the same customization options that have existed for decades' or 'these are already solved problems and Windows isn't your art project for Instagram.'""

Perhaps the most cogent criticism was this: ""How can Microsoft talk about customization and how they see people arrange their apps as the[y] want then make a start menu that takes all these customisations away.""

There are now 651 comments on this video. The inordinate majority appear to be very recent.

At the time of the Windows 11 launch Microsoft released more videos explaining why this new version was completely uplifting.

I'll never forget the coruscating revelation from one marketing person: ""We looked at the Microsoft logo and turned it blue.""

Yet I have sympathy with Microsoft too. The company tried to make Windows look just a little more visually alluring. Simpler too.

But why Microsoft has now chosen to poke committed unhappy users into self-expression I'm not too sure.

Sometimes you have to let people live with something and make their own choices. This seems a good time to refer you to my colleague Ed Bott's emotionally soothing column: ""I hate Windows 11. Can I downgrade to Windows 10?""

Microsoft you can't please everyone especially when you're trying to make progress as a lovable brand.

Still I can confidently reveal that engineers love Windows 11. How do I know? Microsoft says so.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vYXdzLmFtYXpvbi5jb20vYmxvZ3MvbW9kZXJuaXppbmctd2l0aC1hd3MvdGhlcm1vLWZpc2hlci1pbnRlZ3JhdGVkLW1pY3Jvc29mdC13aXRoLWF3cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Thermo Fisher Scientific integrated Microsoft Power Apps with data lake resources on AWS to enable automated ...,"About Thermo Fisher Scientific

Ever-growing needs for Actionable Insights

Thermo Fisher has grown through acquisitions and has a complex ecosystem. Thermo Fisher has a data-driven culture and a business drive to ingest new data and derive actionable business insights. Thermo Fisher’s Enterprise Technology Organization (ETO) has built a data lake namely Enterprise Data Platform (EDP) that supports different business group’s Analytics/DW/BI needs. The ETO team has used Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) as the data lake solution because of its high availability scalability 11 9s of durability and cost efficiency. Business users on the other hand are familiar with Microsoft Office 365 tools and use Excel SharePoint and Power Apps for their day-to-day requirements. When they need data lake resources they prefer to raise the request within the Microsoft platform itself.

In this blog post we explain how the ETO Team integrated Microsoft Power Apps with data lake resources provisioned on Amazon S3. We will also walk through the workflow devised to automate and enable the self-service platform for business users familiar with the Microsoft platform.

The ETO team works closely with business stakeholders to support their ever-growing needs. As of early 2022 the ETO team serves eight business groups and 14 corporate functions (HR Finance IT etc.). When the ETO team developed EDP their goal was to have business users self-serve to get their resources created with the least amount of lead time.

Creation and management of data lake S3 buckets was a manual multi-step process. Business users had to put in the request which went through an approval cycle. Each of the S3 buckets must follow certain standards including encryption lifecycle policy S3 storage class analysis configuration tagging and access control to be compliant with Thermo Fisher’s policies for ensuring data security. There are hundreds of TBs of data maintained in the EDP data lake. As of early 2022 the EDP has hundreds of buckets per environment (Dev QA Prod) and dozens of buckets being created per week. The ETO team has planned to automate the end-to-end process that would provide a seamless faster experience to business stakeholders.

Existing Manual Process

Thermo Fisher’s business users are familiar with Office 365 tools and Microsoft Power Apps. The business users used to put the S3 bucket provisioning requests in the Power Apps platform and notify the ETO admin team. The ETO admin team would then collect the requirements from the Power Apps platform update the AWS CloudFormation template manually with the bucket configuration and provision the bucket by running the updated CloudFormation template. AWS CloudFormation is an infrastructure as code service that gives developers and businesses an easy way to create a collection of related AWS and third-party resources and provision and manage them in an orderly and predictable fashion.

However the manual process of gathering business requirements and updating the CloudFormation templates takes time especially with the scale of the enterprise. Hence introducing an innovative approach to link the Microsoft ecosystem and AWS together in one workflow became important. When Microsoft introduced REST API capability in the Power Apps platform it helped the ETO team build the integration between Microsoft ecosystem and AWS.

Enabling self-service by integrating Microsoft Power Apps with AWS

The ETO team at Thermo Fisher designed the architecture (as shown in Figure 1) to remove the manual work required to update the CloudFormation templates. This serverless architecture is performant cost efficient and reduces the operational overhead.

Let us dive deep into how this architecture enables a self-service platform through the integrated workflow as illustrated in Figure 2:

The following numbers correspond to the steps shown in Figure 2:

Business user submits a S3 bucket creation request in the PowerApps interface. The app requires all mandatory tags and justification for security and compliance requirements. There are links to documentation on the app to guide the user. Power Automate forwards the request to the admin team for review and approval. Once approved the system processes the next step. Power Apps uses REST API Action to call Amazon API Gateway (API Gateway) a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create publish maintain monitor and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the “front door” for applications to access data business logic or functionality from backend services. Power Apps passes the S3 bucket configuration details to the API Gateway. The ETO team has used a combination of Lambda authorizers and IP restrictions to enforce security. API Gateway triggers an AWS Lambda function to create the S3 bucket. AWS Lambda is a serverless event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers. The REST API call carries all the S3 bucket configuration details. AWS Lambda creates the S3 bucket and uses an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) execution role that only allows the access to create buckets. IAM provides fine-grained access control across all of AWS. With IAM one can specify who can access which services and resources and under which conditions. The ETO team uses the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) package to create the buckets. If there are any errors AWS Lambda returns the error code which is passed to the Power Apps via an API Gateway response. Power Apps sends an email to the admin team via the Power Automate Outlook activity. AWS Lambda logs success or error messages in Amazon CloudWatch a monitoring and observability service that provides customers with data and actionable insights to monitor the applications. Upon success Power Automate sends an email to the user and the ETO admin team. The email is sent by an Office 365 Service Account.

Conclusion

With this automated self-service platform the ETO team reduced the data lake resource provisioning turnaround time from days to hours. Also the integration between Microsoft Power Apps with AWS services allowed the ETO team to decouple business user experience from the backend technology. This helped the ETO team choose the right technology and cloud provider for their data lake requirements without disrupting the experience of the business users who can continue with the tool sets that they are comfortable with.

This solution is the first step in building a bridge between the Microsoft Office ecosystem and AWS in the Thermo Fisher environment. Continuing to build on the power of the Amazon API Gateway as the bridge the ETO team plans to expand and scale up the solution to pair and match other AWS services and Microsoft Office Services. As a next step the team plans to address the following automation needs:

Request for AWS Management Console access or AWS IAM access key creation

Request to add service access or security policies to an existing IAM role

Request access to data lake so that users can query data using their preferred analytics platform

The ETO team believes that this will activate and inspire endless possibilities where resource auto-creation is merely a start. This will foster innovation drive more automation and process improvements within Thermo Fisher.

There was some head-scratching across the big tech and gaming worlds in January when Microsoft announced an agreement to buy Activision Blizzard a leading videogame publisher for $68.7 billion. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella framed its largest acquisition ever as a boost to the company's growing metaverse strategy even though Activision is best known for blockbuster games such as Call of Duty World of Warcraft and Candy Crush but not the mix of AR/VR and other technology underpinning the fledgling metaverse. Upon closer inspection however Microsoft may now be better situated to become a leader in both the metaverse and gaming realms. ""Microsoft is extremely well-positioned for the metaverse"" Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler recently told CNBC. ""But I don't think this [acquisition] was purely a metaverse drive. They were also looking for bigger ways to gain depth and breadth in gaming."" Moerdler anticipated that Microsoft might buy smaller game studios but ultimately ""decided it was better to make one big [purchase] versus lots of little ones"" he said. The proposed deal still requires approvals from shareholders and U.S. and international regulators which is expected to push the closing to June 2023.

Microsoft has played up the metaverse concept in its acquisition messaging and between now and the deal's anticipated close Microsoft is speaking in terms of a dual-track model. ""Gaming has been key to Microsoft since our earliest days as a company"" said Nadella in an email to its roughly 181000 employees about the acquisition. ""Today it's the largest and fastest-growing form of entertainment and as the digital and physical worlds come together it will play a critical role in the development of metaverse platforms."" There's no doubt that gaming is an attractive lucrative sector. The global games market generated $180.3 billion in 2021 according to market research firm Newzoo which predicts that gaming revenue will soar to $218.8 billion by 2024. eMarketer estimated that 2.96 billion people worldwide played digital games last year whether via console computer or mobile device and that the figure will reach 3.09 billion in 2022 — or about a third of the planet's population.

Activision Blizzard and the metaverse

Microsoft first ventured into videogaming in 2001 with the release of the Xbox console now in its fourth generation and enjoying a 14% jump in sales in the third quarter. Today the Microsoft Gaming division helmed by CEO Phil Spencer comprises 23 game design and software studios and hundreds of games. The division's Game Pass subscription service has more than 25 million customers while nearly 10 million people have streamed games on the Xbox Cloud Gaming service. While Activision isn't considered a player in the metaverse — which remains a work in progress with various definitions — one of its videogames offers a good example of how it works. Blizzard released World of Warcraft in 2004 when it was the game studio that later merged with Activision in 2008. ""It's a virtual world [your avatar] could walk around in with friends build a tribe and go on raids together. That's the metaverse"" said Mike Sepso a former executive at the combined entity who is now the CEO of Vindex an esports infrastructure platform. Sepso points to several other games that incorporate metaverse elements such as Roblox Fortnite Second Life and Microsoft's Minecraft. On those platforms players can teleport between millions of games build virtual social spaces and even attend concerts — all while purchasing virtual stuff to heighten the experience. Most of these types of games require VR headsets and consoles which favors Microsoft with its HoloLens and Xbox hardware. The virtual worlds in those games may not level up to the ones being prognosticated by metaverse proponents where users are immersed via mixed reality in business meetings doctor visits vacations and all types of ecommerce. That's where Microsoft's software cloud computing gaming and virtual technologies position the company well. And adding Activision's gaming capabilities only enhances its outlook. ""I definitely see [the metaverse] as an extension of what gaming has been doing"" Spencer told The New York Times' Kara Swisher in her Sway podcast about a week before the deal was announced. For instance he said Microsoft game developers are imagining virtual work spaces and some of the things they've learned in videogames about people coming together to cooperate to achieve tasks.

watch now

However — and whenever — the metaverse materializes it will be predominately populated by Gen Z and subsequent generations who will have exclusively grown up in the digital world especially gaming. According to a recent study of Gen Z gamers by Razorfish and Vice Media Group they spend twice as much time hanging out with friends in the metaverse than they do in real life. More than half said they would like to experience making money in the metaverse; 33% would like to experience building a career there; and 20% of their entertainment/leisure budgets will be earmarked for in-game purchases over the next five years.

Tech stocks in correction

While the tech sector is experiencing a correction Microsoft remains one of its strongest players after its third-quarter earnings and strong demand for its cloud services and software capabilities — both core components of the metaverse and gaming businesses — factor into its operating strength. Activision reported lackluster first-quarter earnings hurt by lower demand for its latest Call of Duty games but its most notable new investor Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway has been increasing his company's stake a merger arbitrage play he told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders at the recent annual meeting betting that Microsoft's proposed acquisition of the video game company will close. Berkshire now owns about 9.5% of Activision shares. As tech has cratered Activision's stock price has fallen as much as 20% below Microsoft's bid of $95 per share. Clay Griffin an analyst at MoffettNathanson said the weaker-than-expected numbers on Call of Duty are bad for the fundamental story behind Activision. Should the deal collapse and Activision be forced to go it alone the stock would probably be valued somewhere in the mid-$60s — but Griffin doesn't expect that to happen. ""Occasionally I'll see an arbitrage deal and do it"" Buffett said. ""Occasionally it looks like the odds are in our favor but absolutely we can lose money on that company fairly large sums of money depending on what happened if the deal blows up."" ""We don't know what the Justice Department will do we don't know what the EU will do we don't know what 30 other jurisdictions will do. One thing we do know is that Microsoft has the money"" Buffett added. Microsoft and Activision declined to comment.

Based on Activision-Blizzard's recent financials Microsoft may lose out on over $1 billion in sales revenue if it keeps Call of Duty off of PlayStation hardware.

Recent financials show that making Call of Duty exclusive to Xbox platforms will have a significant material impact on earnings and revenues generated by Activision. Microsoft could lose out on over $1 billion in revenues and Sony in turn could lose out on some $500 million every year. That's not a whole lot of loss for Sony who has made $10.2 billion in FY21 so far but it's not nothing either.

Popular Now: Scientists use supercomputer to find out when humanity will perish

This could lead to the FTC making a provision in the Activision-Blizzard buyout mandating Microsoft to keep Call of Duty cross-platform in perpetuity.

A quick look at Activision-Blizzard's recent annual report shows some interesting figures.

5

The totals for 2021's revenues from customers for example were as follows:

Apple - $1.496 bn

Google - $1.496 bn

Sony - $1.320 bn

Microsoft - <$880 m

Total - $5192 from top customers (does not include Nintendo or retailers like Best Buy Walmart etc)

So we know that Activision made $1.320 billion from Sony in 2021. That's after the revenue split that Sony takes.

A bit of math reveals how much Sony kept. While it's likely Sony gives Activision-Blizzard a negotiated cut of revenues let's just say that Sony applies the standard 70-30 split with Sony keeping 30% of revenues.

Activision received $1.320 billion from Sony in 2021. That means the actual value was about $1.885 billion.

Based on this Sony kept roughly $565.71 million for itself. If Microsoft makes Call of Duty exclusive to Xbox Sony will not get these kinds of revenues. We don't know how much of this is from Call of Duty but a good portion of it likely is.

5

Activision also confirmed that it made $2.637 billion in console platform revenues. Thus Sony made 50% of console revenues for 2021.

Most of Activision-Blizzard's 2021 console revenues were from the Activision segment which made $2.502 billion in the year. Blizzard on the other hand made up $135 million.

5

While we don't know how much Sony made just from Call of Duty we do know other data Activision says that 3 of its top franchises Call of Duty Candy Crush and Warcraft made up 82% of its consolidated 2021 net revenues. This equals to roughly $7.22 billion.

Only 1 of Activision's top 3 franchises are available on Sony platforms--Call of Duty. Since we don't know the % split between these franchises we can't extrapolate proper relation data (remember I am referring to Activision's segment which does not include Blizzard games).

But it is fair to say that most of Sony's paid-out revenues were from Call of Duty especially since other franchises like Overwatch and Diablo made less than 10% of net revenues.

Smaller franchises available on Sony's platforms include Overwatch Diablo Tony Hawk Pro Skater and Spyro.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZ2FkZ2V0LmNvbS9taWNyb3NvZnQtb3Blbi1zb3VyY2VzLTNkLW1vdmllLW1ha2VyLWNvZGUtMTkwMDUzOTEyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft open sources the code for 3D Movie Maker,"Microsoft has open sourced the code for the 27-year-old program 3D Movie Maker — and it's all thanks to someone who asked on Twitter. Foone whose Twitter profile says they're a ""hardware and software necromancer"" asked the tech giant for the source code to the program so they could expand and extend it. Microsoft doesn't own the BRender engine it runs on which potentially posed a problem but the one who does own it told Foone that he would be happy to open source it if he can find a copy. Thankfully someone kept a copy of the engine and Microsoft was able to release the program's code in its entirety.

Hey friends - we've open sourced the code to 1995's Microsoft 3D Movie Maker https://t.co/h4mYSKRrjK Thanks to @jeffwilcox and the Microsoft OSS office as well our friends in legal and those who continue to put up with me being a nudzh. Thanks to @foone for the idea! Enjoy. https://t.co/6wBAkjkeIP — Scott Hanselman 🇺🇦 (@shanselman) May 4 2022

3D Movie Maker which was released in 1995 gives users an easy way to create films by placing cartoony characters and props into pre-rendered environments. According to PCGamer Foone plans to update the program so it can run on modern PCs as well as add features to make it easier to share the resulting videos. ""I'm expecting I'll get the basic modernized version in the next month to a few months depending on how many issues I run into"" they told PCGamer.

The original source code for the project is now on GitHub made available under the MIT license as open source. As RockPaperShotgun notes the program's BRender engine was also used for games such as Carmageddon 1 & 2 so the code's release could potentially lead to fan-updated versions that can run more smoothly on modern computers."

More than a decade after its founding the Cambridge biotech rolled out its first commercial product last year. And what a debut it was: a cutting-edge COVID-19 vaccine that helped to save thousands ― if not millions ― of lives around the world.

It was also a massive moneymaker for Moderna which up until then had been unprofitable. With more than $38 billion in total COVID-19 vaccine sales expected by the end of this year ― many of the doses paid for by governments ― investors are wondering what the company plans to do with that windfall. Despite Moderna’s spectacular success the question of what’s next looms large and the pressure is on to avoid becoming a one-hit wonder.

On Tuesday Molson Coors (TAP) delivered quarterly earnings that beat analyst expectations posting revenue of $2.2 billion along with adjusted earnings of $0.29 per share.

Molson Coors CEO Gavin Hattersley said in a press release that the results represented ""the most quarterly top-line growth this company has had in more than ten years"" reiterating its 2022 guidance for both top and bottom line growth.

Still the beer giant cited inflation as a top concern for the rest of the year along with the pandemic.

The company said it's been able to battle inflationary headwinds by utilizing ""strong pricing and sales mix"" crediting its top-selling brand portfolio that also includes hard seltzers.

""Many of our core brands continued to outperform their peers we again earned the largest growth in U.S. hard seltzers among major brewers and our expansion beyond beer continued to track ahead of our $1 billion revenue target"" Hattersley said.

Molson Coors put its full support behind Topo Chico Hard Seltzer (a standout for the quarter) along with Vizzy Hard Seltzer after the company discontinued its Coors Light Hard Seltzer brand just last year.

At the time the company doubled down that the hard seltzer boom was here to stay despite the fizzle that's occurred since the category's meteoric rise in 2018 when sales volume hit peak growth of 246% according to IWSR data.

(Source: Nielsen via Bank of America)

Hard seltzer volume sank 2.5% year-over-year with all key players' volume declining with the exception of Mark Anthony Brands (White Claw Mike's) and Molson Coors (Topo Chico Vizzy Henry's) Bank of America (BAC) said in a recent note.

AB InBev's (BUD) hard seltzer portfolio which includes Bon & Viv Bud Light Seltzer and Michelob ULTRA Organic Seltzer declined 13% year-over-year.

Meanwhile White Claw saw 1% year-over-year volume growth and gained 15 basis points sequentially (with market share at 43%.) Truly dropped 12% with a loss of 65bps Vizzy lost 25bps Corona lost 20bps and Topo Chico gained 60bps (all sequential).

Ready-to-drink category surges ahead of summer

The ready-to-drink (RTD) cocktail category is expected to continue its strong momentum heading into summer 2022.

According to NielsenIQ vodka-based drinks accounted for more than half of the ready-to-drink category’s off-premise sales for the 52-week period ending October 2 2021 — increasing 110% over the previous year.

There were also notable increases in tequila-based RTDs at 138% growth followed by rum-based drinks at 132%.

Story continues

Whiskey maker Jack Daniels (BF-B) recently came out with its own line of ready-to-drink cocktails featuring flavors that include Jack & cola; Jack honey & lemonade; and Jack apple fizz.

Still despite the variety of new products on the market High Noon remains a dominating force.

The vodka-based ready-to-drink offering has held the number 1 position on Drizly’s list of top-selling RTD brands for two years now — with even more room to run.

The brand just released a new pool variety pack which features two new flavors (guava and kiwi) in addition to a limited line of High-Noon inspired bathing suits and apparel in collaboration with Chicago-based clothing brand Tropical Bros.

The swimwear along with the Hawaiian shirt retails for roughly $50 per item.

High Noon's rapid success is due in part to its marketing.

Although the brand is technically a vodka-based ready-to-drink offering it positions itself as a vodka-based hard seltzer; consequently it's been able to capture some of that hard seltzer market in addition to the RTD category at large says Liz Paquette Drizly’s head of consumer insights.

Competitors like Truly owned by Boston Beer Company (SAM) have also released new offerings ahead of summer.

Earlier this week the hard seltzer brand launched its own limited-edition poolside variety pack inspired by pop star Dua Lipa. Dua will serve as the company's ""chief flavor officer"" of the new pack which includes four new flavors: strawberry melon fizz orange peach spritz piña colada and kiwi mojito.

The pack will be available nationwide beginning May 15.

Here are our answers plus some from our forum.

Nat Clayton Features Producer: I've been the craven Dr Pepper fiend and spent countless uni nights rendered sleepless by Monster binges. But I'm old now and so so tired so my gaming tends to be accompanied by a nice cuppa tea a home-brewed coffee (I've become a snob after my partner gifted me an Aeropress ordering grind by the kilo from a lovely wee place down Portobello) or a hot choc for some chill late night gaming sessions.

Lauren Aitken Deputy Guides Editor: I once had a Chinese and champagne when playing Halo 3 but really it depends on the game. Usually a cool pint from my PerfectDraft machine or some wine but if it's during the day then endless cups of tea.

Tim Clark Brand Director: In the day: Cherry Vanilla Diet Coke for caffeine various flavours of La Croix (but not the Limoncello which is trash.) After hours: Good single malt whiskey.

Imogen Mellor Features Producer: Depends on the game. If it's something I'm savouring with a good story or adventure a lager IPA or a glass of wine (probably red). But if I'm playing Valorant as I have been a lot recently alcohol slows reactions so I keep off the bevs and go for orange juice water or black Aeropress coffee. Nothing worse than losing MMR to pinot noir.

Mollie Taylor Trainee News Writer: I gotta admit I'm terrible at staying hydrated. I'm trying to be one of those put-together adults who drinks a ton of water but instead I'm probably quickly grabbing a can of Coke Zero before I do some raiding in Final Fantasy 14. Sometimes I'll treat myself to a nice cider but I don't tend to drink much inside the house.

As a side note I drank an absolute butt ton of elderflower cordial and lemonade when I played the Kingdom Hearts series as a kid. Whenever I go back to those games I always get the urge to drink that. Weird how we associate the daftest things with our favourite games huh?

Robin Valentine Print Editor: As the guy who doesn't drink alcohol caffeine or fizzy drinks my answer to this is very boring. I usually just have a glass of fruit squash (does that have a US equivalent?) or a bottle of water next to me and I can't say I've ever tailored my beverage to the game I was playing.

Tim: Squash basically doesn't exist in the US. You can imagine how I feel about this.

Robin: Barbaric country.

Evan Lahti Global Editor-in-Chief: The celestial light of Whirlyball may one day touch your grey island and on that day you will be enlightened.

Morgan Park Staff Writer: I don't know what the heck Aeropress coffee is (sounds like it involves jet propulsion) but I can't imagine sipping something hot while playing a game. You'll often find me with two drinks on the desk: one can of some sort of energy drink (I really like NOS because it tastes like orange juice) and a tall cup of ice water in an insulated bottle because un-iced water is tragic. I try to drink both equally so I'm never dehydrated. If it's too late to caffeinate I'll dip into some Crystal Light lemonade mix and make a pitcher.

Lauren Morton Associate Editor: How much trouble am I going to get in for admitting that I drink coffee from 8am until 11pm regardless of the game?

Tyler Wilde Executive Editor: Lauren I feel like I've just learned that you're a novelty character build in an MMO. And Morgan's observation that he'll ""dip into"" his Crystal Light stash is so astute: I also treat powdered drinks as if they're non-renewable stores of value. I love to sneak a packet of generic red electrolyte dust now and then. I used to drink alcohol but my relationship with it wasn't working out for anyone except Suntory Holdings so the most potent beverage I drink these days is tea made from Douglas fir spring tips (it's slightly sweet and all tree-flavored). Morgan is right though: Hot beverages are inconvenient while playing games. Forget to keep sipping for 15 minutes and you've got lukewarm spring tips—a risk I don't take lightly.

Sarah James Guides Writer: I'm with Lauren on this. It's coffee for me regardless of the time of day (or night). Occasionally I'll switch things up with squash but yeah mostly just coffee.

Wes Fenlon Senior Editor: I'm mostly a water guzzler but in the evenings or on weekends if I'm hopping onto a game with my Discord friends I'll often have a beer. Whatever I have on hand but my go-to grocery store picks are Modelo Negra and Blue Moon. Both are fairly light and refreshing which is nice for a chill hangout sesh. Now that I think about it I could really go for some Hefeweizen...

Jorge Jimenez Hardware Writer: I'm a Red Bull poured into a frozen beer mug type of guy. I'm the worst. Maybe water at some point.

Morgan: That sounds divine Jorge.

Andy Chalk NA News Lead: Monday to Thursday it's water. Fridays are all beer generally cheap German or UK imports as they're available and on sale (Pißwasser ahoy!) but I'll occasionally indulge in overpriced local microbrews. They're not worth the extra cost (and really there's only so much you can do with an IPA before you start to look silly) but I like to think they lend me a certain air of sophistication as I sit alone in the basement playing Shadow Warrior 3 and yelling at my cats.

Alan Dexter Senior Hardware Editor: My drinking habits are chaotic evil: red wine homebrewed beer quality single-malt whisky tea water coffee anything goes really and at any time of the day—unless you're asking my boss in which case I definitely don't start the serious drinking until my working day is done. I won't touch so-called energy drinks though because my body is a temple. Obviously.

Jody Macgregor Weekend/AU Editor: I drink tea when I play videogames but I also drink tea when I read books watch TV shows and work. I'm drinking tea right now. The only time I don't is when I play board games or roleplay when I switch to beer or cider because I like to get loose when the dice come out and also whenever I'm expected to talk to people for any length of time.

There's an apple cider called Golden Axe brewed by Kaiju Beer that I drink both because it's tasty and because it's got the same name as an arcade game I played a lot of as a kid.

Slasken: I drink Coca Cola Zero no ice cubes. If I am playing racing games maybe a beer.

Withywarlock: Mostly Diet Coke but water is my preferred energy drink.

Frindis: I always have a bottle of Diamond Water on the desk. Filtrated through real diamonds it cleanses my corrupt soul and sharpens my gamer senses. Jokes aside I drink either water cider or beer. On rare occasions I buy a nice bottle of wine or whisky.

Pifanjr: I usually forget to drink while gaming. I might notice every once in a while that I'm thirsty and decide to get up after finishing just this one thing. And this one other thing. And then when I finally stop playing I chug half a litre of water in one go.

Advertising will fall to 45% of total revenue under Musk down from about 90% in 2020 generating $12 billion in revenue in 2028 while subscriptions are expected to pull in another $10 billion according to the report.

The head of electric-vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA) also aims to increase Twitter’s cash flow to $3.2 billion in 2025 and $9.4 billion in 2028 the newspaper reported citing the presentation.

Musk clinched a deal last month to buy Twitter for $44 billion in cash in a move that will shift control of the social media platform populated by millions of users and global leaders to the Tesla chief.

The billionaire has promised to revitalize the company and expand the number of users by cracking down on spam bots and reducing the amount of moderation to facilitate more “free speech.”

After the closure of the deal Musk is expected to become Twitter’s temporary CEO a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.

Among his other goals Musk expects the social media company to bring in $15 million from a payments business in 2023 that will grow to about $1.3 billion by 2028 the NYT cited the document as saying.

Musk anticipates he can increase Twitter’s average revenue per user to $30.22 in 2028 from $24.83 last year it added. He also expects Twitter to have 11072 employees by 2025 up from around 7500.

Revenue from Twitter Blue the company’s premium subscription service launched last year is expected to have 69 million users by 2025 the NYT reported.

Musk in a now deleted tweet last month suggested a raft of changes to the social media giant’s Twitter Blue premium subscription service including slashing its price.

On Thursday Musk listed a group of high-profile investors who are ready to provide funding of $7.14 billion for his Twitter bid including Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and Sequoia Capital.

Musk has increased the financing commitment to $27.25 billion which includes commitments from 19 investors and reduced a margin loan from Morgan Stanley tied to his Tesla stock to $6.25 billion. He has already secured commitments for $13 billion in loans against Twitter shares.

Musk could not be reached for comment. Twitter did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjIvbWF5LzA3L2Vsb24tbXVza3MtdGFrZW92ZXItZmluYW5jaW5nLWRlYWwtY291bGQtY2xpcC10d2l0dGVycy13aW5nc9IBb2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjIvbWF5LzA3L2Vsb24tbXVza3MtdGFrZW92ZXItZmluYW5jaW5nLWRlYWwtY291bGQtY2xpcC10d2l0dGVycy13aW5ncw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon Musk’s takeover financing deal could clip Twitter’s wings,"If you want to know who the world’s richest man has on speed dial then a regulatory filing on Thursday provided an insight. Elon Musk announced a score of new backers for his $44bn (£35.6bn) Twitter takeover including Oracle tycoon Larry Ellison the crypto market’s leading trading platform the Qatari sovereign wealth fund and a Saudi prince.

If this was Tesla’s boss displaying his power network it was also an admission that – despite recent words to the contrary – the numbers behind his audacious bid do matter. Discussing his offer last month Musk said: “I don’t care about the economics at all.” For some of Wall Street’s biggest banks Tesla’s shareholders and even Twitter users the economics are very important indeed.

The initial funding package behind the takeover which requires shareholder approvalwas initially split into three elements: $21bn in equity or Elon Musk’s own cash; $12.5bn of loans secured against Musk’s shares in Tesla the electric carmaker that he runs; and a further $13bn in loans from a group of seven banks secured against Twitter itself.

That changed on Thursday. According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the equity commitment had risen to $27.25bn helped by a group of 18 investors including Ellison ($1bn) the Binance trading platform ($500m) and Qatar Holding ($375m) an investment arm of the Gulf state’s wealth fund. They are putting in $7.1bn plus a contribution from the Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal who also plans to roll his $1.9bn Twitter stake into the deal rather than cashing out.

As part of this reshuffle the loans secured against Musk’s 15.7% stake in Tesla have been halved to $6.25bn. The bank loan commitment stays the same.

Musk’s comment about the economics of the bid in an interview at a TED conference in mid-April came before he confirmed hastily put-together funding for a takeover. It was a move that swayed shareholders in Twitter and the company’s board who accepted the bid days later. But the off-the-cuff nature of his comments belie the serious nature of the financial commitments the Tesla tycoon is making. Some experts point to a high-risk structure regardless of last week’s changes – and what it means for the company he is buying.

“Musk hasn’t provided a lot of detail about his business plan for the company” says Jill Fisch a professor of business law at the University of Pennsylvania. “Although he has taken steps to reduce his risk by bringing in additional investors he still has a lot of personal exposure financially he is paying a high price based on Twitter’s existing business model and he has large loans from the banks. Given the size of Musk’s personal financial exposure he will be under pressure to run Twitter to make money both to manage his own financial risk and to repay the bank financing.”

First let’s look at Musk’s commitment. Last month he revealed he had sold $8.5bn worth of shares in Tesla since announcing the takeover presumably to help fund the deal. His stake in Tesla which forms the core of his wealth is integral to financing the deal. If you strip out new investors and Prince Talwaleed’s stake plus Musk’s own $3.9bn stake in Twitter he still needs to provide around $14.3bn of equity for the deal. A simple reading of this would be: he owns $155bn in Tesla shares so contributing just over $14bn should be easy.

But it is not quite as straightforward as that. According to a filing with the SEC Musk has already pledged 92.3m of his 163m Tesla shares as “collateral to secure certain personal indebtedness”. Then there is the $6.25bn already pledged for the deal – in an arrangement known as a margin loan where the borrower could be required to make good any shortfall in the value of the shares that the debt is secured against.

Presuming the loan-to-value ratio of 20% in the original margin loan agreement is carried over this means a further 35.8m shares are tied up. So looking at Musk’s total shareholding this leaves him with about 35m unpledged shares worth $30bn. In theory these could be pledged or sold to raise the remaining $14bn of cash needed for the deal. But Musk tweeted on 29 April that he had “No further TSLA sales planned after today”.

Drew Pascarella a senior lecturer of finance at Cornell University says he would be surprised if Morgan Stanley the Wall Street bank that has played the lead role in the debt financing had not carried out some form of due diligence on Musk’s commitment. “There is no way Morgan Stanley would have proceeded as they did unless they had looked in Elon’s eyes and seen some evidence that he could come up with that money.”

The Tesla chief executive has other sources of wealth including Tesla shares already sold his SpaceX rocket business and his Boring Company tunnelling firm. He is also in line to receive $20bn worth of Tesla share options (based on Friday’s share price) although he cannot cash these in for five years.

According to calculations by CreditSights a credit research firm the bank financing alone will leave Twitter highly leveraged once the deal is completed. Twitter’s gross indebtedness will be nine times its underlying Ebitda – a measure of profit – for 2021 says CreditSights.

“That is very high and certainly not a comfortable amount of leverage” says Jordan Chalfin a senior technology analyst at CreditSights. It is against the backdrop of these numbers that Musk has floated ideas such as charging a “slight” fee for commercial and government users although it will stay free for casual users.The New York Times also reported on Friday that Musk expects to pay down the $800m-$900m debt interest costs with free cash flow that he expects to grow to $9.4bn by 2028 although in the short term it looks like it will be tight. According to Chaflin a proxy for Twitter’s ability to cover its debt interest would be subtracting Twitter’s capital expenditure costs – $1bn last year – from the company’s Ebitda. Stock market analysts’ forecasts for Twitter Ebitda according to a Reuters poll is $1.4bn in 2022 and $1.8bn in 2023. It could be a squeeze.

“The extremely high levels of debt Elon plans to saddle Twitter with come at a high price – investment for growth” says Cornell’s Pascarella. “A technology company like Twitter needs to invest in itself to continue to innovate and grow. Post deal most of Twitter’s cash flow will be used not for investment but to service debt.”Speaking about Twitter at a recent conference Musk said: “I mean I could technically afford it.” He can but some users might have to pay."

The Ayer Mansion the only home in the world completely designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany the son of Tiffany & Co. founder Charles Lewis Tiffany just went on sale for $17 million in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston.

Unveiled in 1902 the five-story Gilded Age mansion spans a whopping 15600 square feet. Developers are hoping to restore it to its origins as a single-family home that features six bedrooms 13 bathrooms 10 fireplaces and a roof deck among other luxe amenities.

Despite the renovations many of the home’s original details will ideally remain in place. Tiffany took inspiration for the mansion from ancient Greece the Far East and even the Chicago World’s Fair. The impressive foyer’s white marble staircase showcases Tiffany mosaic tiles and a trompe l’oeil Greek temple is seen through the proscenium arch. Stained-glass windows and skylights beautiful plasterwork and elaborate mantels are just a few additional highlights.

“The character of the home is what really makes it special” David J. Hacin the principal and creative director of Hacin + Associates the architecture firm tasked with updating the Ayer Mansion said in a statement. “It immediately struck me as both modern and rooted in the construct of the Back Bay at the same time and that is really unique.”

The home was originally designed for the businessman Frederick Ayer and his wife Ellen who commissioned Tiffany for the design. While better known for his leaded-glass lamps Tiffany had a hand in everything from the exterior of the house to the decorative objects and wallpaper. In 2005 the property was designated a National Historic Landmark.

The Ayer Mansion is being marketed by Ruth Kennedy Sudduth and Greta Gustafson of LandVest. The current sellers are the developers Charles Reed of CNW Capital Partners and Jean Abouhamad of Sea-Dar Real Estate. The two men had initially planned to convert the property into condos but after seeing the extraordinary home and all of its historic details they thought otherwise.

“It’s a piece of art” Abouhamad told The Wall Street Journal.

The metaverse pioneer sees engagement trends decline as kids return to school and economies reopen. The company thrived at the pandemic's onset as billions of people spent more time at home.

When it reports Q1 figures on May 10 it will be interesting to see if management's expectations have changed from the most recent update they provided investors. At that time Roblox was forecasting that engagement trends would improve around the middle of the year.

Players are decreasing spending on Roblox

Roblox is free to join and use. The company makes money by selling an in-game currency called Robux. The unique business model creates a gap between when players buy Robux and when the company recognizes revenue. Therefore looking at bookings which measure purchases of Robux can be as important a metric as revenue in this case.

Bookings exploded by 229% in the second quarter of 2020 for Roblox. Unsurprisingly it coincided with the COVID-19 outbreak. The growth rate for booking has been consistently falling ever since culminating at a rate of 20% in its most recently completed quarter which ended Dec. 31. Interestingly Roblox provides investors with monthly updates and in its most recent update in February it noted that bookings were down 3% from the same time a year earlier.

When accounting for the fact that it had 28% more users than at the same time last year the average bookings level per daily active user was down 24.5% year over year. After surging during the pandemic it's understandable that Roblox would give back some of the gains. However what's worrying investors is the uncertainty about how much of those gains it will give back.

Management told investors they could expect year-over-year booking comparisons to start improving around May or June acknowledging this concern. The company will be holding a conference call in the morning following the earnings announcement on May 11 and you can expect analysts to ask management for an update on this forecast.

What this could mean for Roblox investors

Analysts on Wall Street expect Roblox to report revenue of $639.46 million and a loss per share of $0.22. If the company meets those projections it will represent increases of 26.7% and 52.2% respectively from the same period the year before.

Moreover the revenue increase would be the slowest growth rate in at least three years for the metaverse pioneer. In addition to the broader growth stock sell-off the deceleration has hit Roblox's stock. Down 71% in 2022 it is trading at the lowest price-to-free-cash-flow ratio in years. Investors who can stomach the uncertainty in the short term can add Roblox stock to their list of stocks to buy especially if management notes that engagement trends have improved.

(NASDAQ:XXII) Just Reported And Analysts Have Been Lifting Their Price Targets,"22nd Century Group Inc. (NASDAQ:XXII) just released its quarterly report and things are looking bullish. Revenues and losses per share were both better than expected with revenues of US$9.0m leading estimates by 9.4%. Statutory losses were smaller than the analystsexpected coming in at US$0.05 per share. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models following these results.

Check out our latest analysis for 22nd Century Group

Taking into account the latest results the current consensus from 22nd Century Group's twin analysts is for revenues of US$37.3m in 2022 which would reflect a solid 12% increase on its sales over the past 12 months. The loss per share is expected to ameliorate slightly reducing to US$0.21. Yet prior to the latest earnings the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$39.0m and losses of US$0.30 per share in 2022. While the revenue estimates fell sentiment seems to have improved with the analysts making a considerable decrease in losses per share in particular.

There was a decent 38% increase in the price target to US$5.50 with the analysts clearly signalling that the expected reduction in losses is a positive despite a weaker revenue outlook.

Of course another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. The period to the end of 2022 brings more of the same according to the analysts with revenue forecast to display 17% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 15% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 3.6% annually. So it's pretty clear that 22nd Century Group is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry.

The Bottom Line

The most obvious conclusion is that the analysts made no changes to their forecasts for a loss next year. They also downgraded their revenue estimates although industry data suggests that 22nd Century Group's revenues are expected to grow faster than the wider industry. Still earnings per share are more important to value creation for shareholders. There was also a nice increase in the price target with the analysts clearly feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.

With that in mind we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on 22nd Century Group. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have analyst estimates for 22nd Century Group going out as far as 2024 and you can see them free on our platform here.

A bear market occurs when an index or the market at large is down 20% from its peak level. With rising interest rates sky-high inflation and geopolitical risk factors pushing the Nasdaq Composite down roughly 25% from the high it hit last year the tech-heavy index is trudging through bear territory right now -- and investors are spooked.

While there are a number of risk factors shaping market sentiment right now there are also great companies that have been pushed down to bargain prices and long-term investors could score big wins by taking smart contrarian stances. Read on to see which stocks a panel of Motley Fool contributors thinks are great buys amid the current bearish backdrop.

This iBuyer is growing and profitable

Jason Hall: In November 2021 Zillow Group shocked the real estate world when it pulled out of the iBuying market. This was a huge reversal for the company which had spent the prior several years -- and a lot of money and human resources -- making this its primary growth focus. While I think it was the right move for Zillow to focus on its asset-light higher-margin real estate platforms I really like the way Opendoor Technologies (OPEN -4.25%) has proven there's still a lot of money to be made for pure-play iBuying companies.

In the first quarter investors got their first glimpse of how ibuying can deliver at scale. When Opendoor reported its results on May 5 it reported $5.2 billion in revenue a massive 590% increase from last year. It also reported gross margin above 10% -- indication that it's buying properties at attractive prices -- and generated a modest $98 million in net income. Maybe most impressively it generated a whopping $1.5 billion in operating cash flow reversing last year's first-quarter outflow of $400 million in operating cash.

Opendoor is still early in the iBuying story but it's showing that at scale this can be a good business. As more sellers look to take advantage of faster lower-fee transactions and a simpler process of selling Opendoor is my pick as a big winner from this growth. At more than 70% off its all-time highs now looks like a great time to buy shares and old for years to come.

This streaming player can post explosive returns

Keith Noonan: Twilio's (TWLO 0.10%) software allows businesses to launch and customize automated information response systems and it provides incredibly important services despite not being a household name. If you've hailed a ride through Lyft or booked a stay through Airbnb you've interacted with its products. The company also provides messaging tools and artificial-intelligence- powered chat bots making it easy to tailor customer service interactions to the situation and adapt as demands evolve.

The company has made some big acquisitions to expand into new markets and help its customers access and analyze data from otherwise walled-off sources and it's also in the early stages of a big push in the customer relationship management (CRM) space. Backing out the contribution from acquisitions over the previous year Twilio's revenue grew 35% year over year in the first quarter. Existing customers increased their spending on Twilio's services 27% year over year in the period and overall sales jumped 48%.

Responsive mobile communication and user engagement technologies are central to meeting modern customer needs and standing out from the competition but that hasn't shielded the company's stock from big sell-offs. With a market capitalization of roughly $21 billion and the currently unprofitable company valued at approximately 5.5 times this year's expected sales Twilio's valuation profile is at odds with current market tastes.

However Twilio stock now trades down roughly 76% from the high that it hit last year and the stock looks attractively valued at current levels. Despite some macroeconomic headwinds on the horizon and the market running from growth stocks at the moment I think the software specialist will deliver big wins for investors.

An education technology business with a strong competitive advantage

Parkev Tatevosian: My top beaten-down growth stock to buy during this bear market is Chegg (CHGG -1.94%). The education technology company has a solid competitive moat and is trading at its lowest valuation in years. What's more its competitive advantage has allowed it to grow revenue efficiently for several years.

Indeed from 2017 to 2021 Chegg's sales expanded from $255 million to $776 million. Chegg is a subscription business that grants access to its platform with millions of pieces of proprietary content. As part of a membership students can ask up to 20 questions per month answered by Chegg's subject-matter experts. In that way Chegg's content creation budget has little waste because it is created at the request of members.

An additional benefit of the content is that it attracts new users with little need for marketing. Students grappling with homework assignments may search for help with a concept; if Chegg has the material in its database it pops up as a search result. A few clicks and a payment later Chegg has a new member. That low-cost customer acquisition can partly explain why Chegg has boosted operating income from a loss of $23 million in 2017 to a gain of $78 million in 2021.

Fortunately for investors the growth stock sell-off has Chegg trading at a bargain valuation -- with shares down roughly 83% from peak level. At a price-to-free-cash-flow of 17 and a price-to-sales of 3.7 Chegg is as cheap as it's ever been in the last five years. Chegg is a strong business with a defendable moat growing efficiently and selling at a bargain valuation. For those reasons it's an excellent growth stock to buy now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMy1zdXJlZmlyZS1zdG9ja3MtdGhhdC1jYW4tdHVybi0kMjAwMDAwLWludG8tJDEtbWlsbGlvbi1ieS0yMDMw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Surefire Stocks That Can Turn $200000 Into $1 Million by 2030,"Whether you're a new or tenured investor you've been given a wake-up call in 2022 that stocks can go down just as easily as they can rise. Since the beginning of the year the broad-based S&P 500 and nearly 126-year-old Dow Jones Industrial Average have declined by more than 10% from their all-time closing highs. Things have been even more challenging for the tech-driven Nasdaq Composite which has shed as much as 24% since its November peak and was firmly in a bear market as of early last week.

But where there's short-term pain there's also an opportunity for long-term gains. That's because every stock market correction and bear market has eventually been wiped away by a bull market rally. When you invest in innovative stocks at a discount and allow your investment thesis to play out over time there's a good chance you'll build wealth.

The following three surefire stocks are all trading at a discount during the market sell-off and have both the catalysts and intangibles necessary to turn a $200000 investment into $1 million by 2030.

Nio

The first innovative company that has the potential to quintuple investors' money over the next eight years is China-based electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Nio (NYSE: NIO).

Auto stocks like Nio are contending with a challenging environment. Semiconductor chip shortages and COVID-19-driven supply shortages have caused most automakers to scale back production on select models. In Nio's case the company delivered just 5074 EVs in April which was less than half of what it was delivering on a monthly basis in November and December. Nio is being hit harder than most automakers given that some Chinese provinces have undergone strict COVID-19 lockdowns.

Although supply chain concerns are never a positive the important thing to note here is that Nio's near-term struggles have absolutely nothing to do with demand. This means opportunistic investors have the chance to buy this innovative EV maker at a substantial discount to its all-time high.

Nio's innovation comes in two forms. The first is readily apparent: its introduction of new vehicles. For example the company's ET7 and ET5 sedans offer up to 621 miles of range with the top battery option. These sedans are direct competitors to Tesla's flagship sedans the Model S and Model 3 and provide superior range (again with the battery upgrade). China is the world's leading auto market which gives Nio a large runway with which to gobble up market share with its premium sedans and SUVs.

The other way Nio is innovating is with its service. In August 2020 the company introduced its battery-as-a-service (BaaS) subscription which allows its EV buyers to charge swap or upgrade their batteries. Enrollment in BaaS also provides a discount on the purchase price of a Nio EV. Despite giving up some near-term sales with BaaS Nio locks in long-term subscription revenue and the loyalty of its early buyers.

Based on Wall Street's fluid forecast Nio is on track to quadruple its sales by 2024 as well as turn the corner to recurring profitability. By 2023 most of the company's supply chain issues should be in the rearview mirror. That makes it a good bet to turn deliver 400% returns for shareholders by 2030.

Upstart Holdings

A second surefire stock that can deliver jaw-dropping sales and profit growth throughout the remainder of the decade is cloud-based lending platform Upstart Holdings (NASDAQ: UPST).

The big knock against Upstart is that historically high inflation in the U.S. is coercing the nation's central bank to get aggressive with interest rate hikes. As a lending-based service there's obvious concern that higher interest rates will dramatically slow loan-processing activity which would be bad news for the company.

But Upstart has a few tricks up its sleeve. To begin with its lending platform relies on artificial intelligence (AI). Whereas the traditional loan-vetting process can take weeks approximately 70% of Upstart's loan applicants are fully automated and approved on the spot. This helps save lending institutions time and money.

What's interesting is that Upstart's AI-powered lending platform is helping to democratize loan access without adversely impacting lending institutions. Even though the average credit score of Upstart's approvals is lower than the average credit score of traditional loan approvals there's been no difference in delinquency rates. As interest rates rise and the sheer number of loan applications to process declines it's likely we'll see banks turn to Upstart even more than they are now given the success of its AI-driven lending platform.

Something else investors should note is that Upstart has no credit exposure and generated 94% of its revenue from fees and services. This means if a recession does strike and loan delinquencies rise Upstart doesn't have to set aside capital to cover loan losses.

Looking a bit further out Upstart should also benefit from its push into AI-based auto lending. The auto loan origination market is over seven times larger than the personal loan market it's been focused on for years. Upstart is in the very early innings of what should be sustained rapid growth.

Pinterest

The third surefire stock that can turn a $200000 investment into a cool $1 million by 2030 is social media company Pinterest (NYSE: PINS).

The pandemic has sent Pinterest on a roller-coaster ride. It initially soared on big user gains with people stuck in their homes during the initial stages of the pandemic. But since the end of March 2021 declines in monthly active user (MAU) figures have left Wall Street skeptical of Pinterest's future. To add there's also concern that Apple's iOS privacy changes which allow app users to turn off data tracking could inhibit ad-driven businesses like Pinterest.

However neither of these near-term headwinds should be fazing long-term investors. For example even though Pinterest's total MAUs have declined from a peak of 478 million to 433 million over the past year panning out four or five years shows a steady uptrend in total MAUs. In other words the MAU decline in recent quarters is simply user growth retracing back to historic norms following the unsustainable pandemic-related boost.

Additionally regardless of whether MAUs have increased or declined on a year-over-year basis Pinterest hasn't had any trouble monetizing its user base. The latest quarter which featured 45 million fewer MAUs than the same quarter last year saw global average revenue per user (ARPU) climb 28% with European ARPU up an even more impressive 40%. This demonstrates that merchants are willing to pay a premium to reach Pinterest's user base. It also clearly suggests that international markets are where Pinterest's greatest opportunity lies.

Apple's iOS privacy changes aren't much to worry about either. While other social media platforms have some guesswork to do in order to help advertisers target users the entire premise of Pinterest's platform is for users to freely and willingly share the things places and services that interest them. This makes Pinterest incredibly valuable for merchants wanting to target specific interests.

Following a nearly 15-month downtrend Pinterest looks ripe for the picking and fully capable of quintupling investors' money by the end of the decade.

(NASDAQ:SMMT) have power over the company. Generally speaking as a company grows institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely insiders often decrease their ownership over time. Warren Buffett said that he likes ""a business with enduring competitive advantages that is run by able and owner-oriented people."" So it's nice to see some insider ownership because it may suggest that management is owner-oriented.

Summit Therapeutics is not a large company by global standards. It has a market capitalization of US$110m which means it wouldn't have the attention of many institutional investors. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below) it seems that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner to discover more about Summit Therapeutics.

See our latest analysis for Summit Therapeutics

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Summit Therapeutics?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register especially if they are growing.

We can see that Summit Therapeutics does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Summit Therapeutics' historic earnings and revenue below but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

Summit Therapeutics is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data we can see that the largest shareholder is the CEO Robert Duggan with 69% of shares outstanding. This essentially means that they have significant control over the outcome or future of the company which is why insider ownership is usually looked upon favourably by prospective buyers. For context the second largest shareholder holds about 6.2% of the shares outstanding followed by an ownership of 2.7% by the third-largest shareholder. Interestingly the third-largest shareholder Mahkam Zanganeh is also a Member of the Board of Directors again indicating strong insider ownership amongst the company's top shareholders.

Story continues

While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. As far as we can tell there isn't analyst coverage of the company so it is probably flying under the radar.

Insider Ownership Of Summit Therapeutics

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business but the CEO will answer to the board even if he or she is a member of it.

Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.

It seems that insiders own more than half the Summit Therapeutics Inc. stock. This gives them a lot of power. Given it has a market cap of US$110m that means they have US$79m worth of shares. It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently.

General Public Ownership

With a 15% ownership the general public mostly comprising of individual investors have some degree of sway over Summit Therapeutics. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Next Steps:

It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Summit Therapeutics better we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted 5 warning signs for Summit Therapeutics you should be aware of and 2 of them are concerning.

Netflix is still reeling from its stock plunge last month after losing subscribers for the first time in more than a decade.

To turn the narrative back in its favor analysts have suggested adding ads and clamping down on password sharing. But one way Netflix can help itself is by allying with an industry that it once was at odds with: movie theaters.

Even though Netflix has released many films in theaters — and has even bought a few theaters to boot — most of its theater releases have been purposefully limited. With the streamer licking its wounds and theaters slowly bouncing back from the pandemic now could be time for both sides to finally come together.

Netflix needs franchises theaters need movies

By releasing more films in theaters Netflix (NFLX) could bring in new revenue from box-office sales expand its brand to more potential subscribers and help make its films more memorable — something the company has struggled to do.

Despite being the leader in streaming with 221 million global subscribers winning multiple Oscars and working with some of the biggest names in Hollywood Netflix hasn’t seen many of its films become beloved brands in the way that some of its series have such “Stranger Things” whose new season premieres later this month.

Take “Red Notice” for example. The film starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Gal Gadot was Netflix’s most-watched movie ever according to the company but arguably failed to make any sort of blip in pop culture.

“It still basically remains impossible to build a major movie franchise without theatrical releases” Andrew Hare a senior vice president of research at Magid told CNN Business.

Hare added that as the company expands its offerings “a number of titles could likely require theatrical.”

“Not only for award season but for the buzz required to be a major player at a hybrid moment in a time that remains one foot in physical and one foot in digital” he said.

Playing nice with Netflix would be a good idea for theaters too.

“Theaters need content now more than ever” said Jeff Bock senior analyst at entertainment research firm Exhibitor Relations. “A lot of Netflix releases have big names attached so that would certainly get them through the turnstiles.”

Even the National Association of Theater Owners are open to the idea.

“Our doors are open to give broader play to Netflix movies” John Fithian NATO’s CEO said last month. “We’d love to play more of their movies.”

What’s the hold up?

One of the biggest roadblocks for Netflix and theaters is both sides have fought over how long a film should play in theaters.

Netflix’s business is based on sign-ups so it doesn’t want subscribers waiting for films while theater owners whose business runs on foot traffic want exclusivity as long as possible.

This debate hit a fever pitch in 2019 when the two sides couldn’t agree on how long “The Irishman” Martin Scorsese’s crime epic should play in theaters before heading to the streamer. Theaters wanted a 70-day exclusive window and Netflix would not go above 45 days according to the New York Times.

But the pandemic changed everything by cutting down the theatrical window industry wide. Even traditional studios like Warner Bros. and Universal Pictures are now releasing theatrical films on streaming after just few weeks or sometimes simultaneously.

Beyond the theatrical window there’s other issues considering that the theater business comes with extra costs that Netflix is not used to.

“It’s definitely not as easy as a homepage takeover” Hare said. “It’s moving from the digital world to the physical. It takes money for marketing and promotion… It’s a number of huge tactical and strategic decisions that need to be made.”

And putting more films in theaters could hurt Netflix’s very model. If you can go see the one Netflix movie you’re itching to see in theaters does that give you less incentive to subscribe?

Ultimately there are pros and cons for Netflix when it comes to working more with theaters. Yet the company needs to right its ship and theaters are steadily returning to normal so now might be the time for the streamer to put more of its films on a marquee.

“I think Netflix continues to be in experimental mode” Hare said. “It can’t afford not to experiment right now.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvc2hlZW5hc2NvdHQvMjAyMi8wNS8wOC9jbGFyay1hLWdyZWF0LW5ldy1zd2VkaXNoLXNlcmllcy1vbi1uZXRmbGl4LXN0YXJyaW5nLWJpbGwtc2thcnNnYXJkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Clark': A Great New Swedish Series On Netflix Starring Bill Skarsgard,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/sheenascott/2022/05/08/clark-a-great-new-swedish-series-on-netflix-starring-bill-skarsgard/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvc2hlZW5hc2NvdHQvMjAyMi8wNS8wOC9jbGFyay1hLWdyZWF0LW5ldy1zd2VkaXNoLXNlcmllcy1vbi1uZXRmbGl4LXN0YXJyaW5nLWJpbGwtc2thcnNnYXJkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vYWJvdXQubmV0ZmxpeC5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy9uZXRmbGl4LWlzLWEtam9rZS10aGUtZmVzdGl2YWwtZmluYWwtd2Vla2VuZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"""Live from Last Night"" at Netflix Is a Joke: The Festival | Exclusive Clip and Photos - FINAL WEEKEND",ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-is-a-joke-the-festival-final-weekend on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vYWJvdXQubmV0ZmxpeC5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy9uZXRmbGl4LWlzLWEtam9rZS10aGUtZmVzdGl2YWwtZmluYWwtd2Vla2VuZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ldGZsaXgtc2VjcmV0LWNvZGVzLWFjY2Vzcy1oaWRkZW4tMDg0NDMyMTYxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix secret codes: How to access hidden TV series and movies on streaming service,"You might think you’ve exhausted everything there is to watch on Netflix.

Best Reason to Watch: Summer is the season for blockbusters and “Stranger Things” is TV’s biggest blockbuster — at least until HBO’s “House of the Dragon” and Amazon Prime’s “Lord of the Rings” premiere at summer’s end. Even with those gargantuan franchises in the offing the Duffer Brothers aren’t giving up the title of TV’s top popcorn program without a fight. Season 4 is being split into two volumes with four or five episodes premiering May 27 and the remaining entries debuting July 1. (Netflix has not announced how exactly the nine-episode season will be split in half.) Moreover the creators have promised Season 4 is nearly twice the length of past seasons featuring thousands of VFX shots spread across more than 800 pages of scripts. No wonder reports have claimed Season 4 cost upwards of $270 million to produce. That’s more than the rumored budget for Marvel’s latest “Doctor Strange” which officially kicks off the summer movie season and “Stranger Things” delivers seven extra hours of story. So if you want to see what all that money can deliver just open up your Netflix app at the end of the month. This summer is going to be a big one for TV. Let’s see if the Hawkins kids can kick things off on the right foot.

2. “The G Word with Adam Conover” (available May 19)

Best Reason to Watch: Executive produced by Barack and Michelle Obama through their company Higher Ground Productions “The G Word” is a six-part comedic docuseries meant to better explain how the United States government affects people’s lives. Investigative comedian Adam Conover (“Adam Ruins Everything”) hosts (and is reason enough to watch) but adding to the impressive talent bringing “The G Word” to life is Michael Lewis whose 2018 book “The Fifth Risk: Undoing Democracy” serves as inspiration for the show. Episodes tackle how the American government impacts food weather money disease the future and change all in tight imaginative and unflinching 30-minute chunks. Making sure the government abides by the will of its people all its people starts with understanding how the government works. “The G Word” hopes to make those lessons a bit easier to digest.

3. “Love Death + Robots” Volume 3 (available May 20)

Best Reason to Watch: A series of animated shorts produced by Tim Miller (“Deadpool”) and David Fincher (“Mindhunter” “Zodiac”) “Love Death + Robots” has followed a familiar pattern of inconsistency over both formally ambitious seasons thus far. Each of the first two entries has its standout episodes and while the great don’t necessarily outweigh the mediocre anyone curious about the format and intrigued by the anything-can-happen nature of episodic storytelling is probably still hopeful everything will click into place for Season 3. We are too as the new episodes “stretch from uncovering an ancient evil to a comedic apocalypse.” There’s no word yet on writers directors or too many other details on what’s coming though one episode does bring the series into serialized territory functioning as a sequel to an episode from Season 1.

4. “The Lincoln Lawyer” (available May 13)

Best Reason to Watch: No this isn’t the 2011 film — Matthew McConaughey isn’t involved and technically the new drama series isn’t even an adaptation of Michael Connelly’s 2005 novel of the same name. “The Lincoln Lawyer” (2022) is actually based on the author’s 2008 sequel “The Brass Verdict” and stars Manuel Garcia-Rulfo (“Goliath”) as Mickey Haller. Developed by Ted Humphrey (“The Good Wife”) and co-written and executive produced by David E. Kelley Netflix’s TV adaptation still focuses on the L.A. lawyer who loves his Lincoln Town Car enough to run his firm out of the backseat and the idealist in Mickey is sure to get him in some trouble with the criminal element of La La Land. Kelley is a former attorney who broke big with court procedurals like “The Practice” and “L.A. Law” before skewing toward prestige TV with the likes of “Big Little Lies” and “The Undoing.” Expect “The Lincoln Lawyer” to draw elements from both as it hopes to make a name for itself among a series of novels a major motion picture and a flood of TV in general.

5. “The Pentaverate” (available May 5)

Best Reason to Watch: Considering a) Mike Myers’ post-“Austin Powers” track record as a comedy star — “The Cat in the Hat” “The Love Guru” those Uber eats ads featuring Wayne and Garth — and b) Netflix declined to make screeners available for critics prior to release it’s probably best to approach “The Pentaverate” with caution. Myers stars (in one of multiple roles) as a Canadian journalist who happens to uncover a centuries-old secret society responsible for protecting the world at all costs. As another threat looms (in addition to their identities being exposed) the less-than-intrepid reporter has to discover the truth and save the planet all while surrounded by people who look eerily familiar. If you’re a fan of Myers’ character work perhaps give this a go — just don’t set the bar too high.

6. “Happy Endings” Seasons 1-3 (leaving May 31)

Best Reason to Watch: Do you absolutely have to watch “Happy Endings” before it leaves Netflix at the end of the month? No — not when it’s still available on Hulu and HBO Max. But if Netflix is your primary streaming service (or you’ve been trimming back on other subscriptions as costs rise) the exit of David Caspe’s short-lived but brilliantly executed hangout comedy is a great reminder to a) reexamine your budget and make sure you’re getting the most of what you want from the services you keep b) start rotating subscriptions rather than remaining loyal to any one service month after month year after year and c) invest in physical media. (And if swapping out DVD discs every few hours is too great a burden to bear you could also buy the episodes via iTunes or your preferred digital hub.) Also there’s literally never a bad time to watch “Happy Endings” so this could just be your most recent excuse to dive back in.

7. “Downton Abbey” Seasons 1-6 (leaving May 31)

Best Reason to Watch: While also not an emergency — “Downton Abbey” seasons are available to stream on Amazon Prime Video and Peacock Premium — it’s worth noting that the original TV run will be departing Netflix less than two weeks after the second movie hits theaters. So if you binge the seasons to get ready for the new film you’ll be fine but if you watch the new film and have the sudden urge to revisit the Crawley family’s rich history you should know there’s a ticking clock. Unless you have other subscriptions in which case again you’ll be just fine.

He stressed that his utmost objective and responsibility is to lead the NPP to convincingly “Break the 8” years electoral cycle.

According to Alhaji Sulemana Iddrisu he was a new entrant into the 2020 general elections as Regional Chairman but succeeded in breaking down the NDC’s monopoly of Gonjaland at previous elections.

He attributed the 2020 victory to the hard work of NPP leadership at all levels and commended government appointees in the region for their unflinching support.

“Upon assumption of office as Regional Chairman within one and half years we went to elections and came out with three solid seats. This was as a result of the leadership we provided with the support of you my respected Constituency Executives Government Appointees and the grassroots of our party in the region.”

“All of us worked very hard to change the narrative in a region that our President and then flag-bearer Nana Addo Dankuah Akuffo-Addo described as a “Lion Den” not just because it was considered as NDC strong hold but the constituency of the NDC flag-bearer.”

He added that “The result of my leadership and hard work is that our party garnered 80605 votes out of a total of 229085 representing 35.19% of the valid votes cast. As that was not enough we increased our Parliamentary seats from one (1) to three (3). This is indeed unprecedented in the history of our party in the region.”

“It is an undeniable fact that my region is one and only one region that went beyond the expectations of many in our party. At various fora before the elections this region was targeted below our current status by the National Party. But we worked against all odds to achieve our current feat.”

Flashback

From 2008 to the 2016 general elections the NPP performed abysmally in Gonjaland and Alhaji Iddrisu Sulemana’s administration changed the dynamics in 2020.

Without winning a single Parliamentary seat in 2012 the NPP secured 54 425 votes out of a total of 157694 in the Presidential election which represented 33% of the total votes cast.

Then in the 2016 Presidential election the NPP garnered 55485 votes out of a total of 166303 valid votes cast and managed to win only the Salaga South Constituency.

In 2020 the party's Regional team led by Alhaji Iddrisu Sulemana alias Professor Kalamonia snatched three traditional Parliamentary seats from the National Democratic Congress (NDC).

In addition to winning the Damongo Daboya/Mankarigu and Salaga North East Parliamentary seats the NPP appreciated in Presidential votes.

Winning three Parliamentary seats in the Savannah Region undoubtedly contributed to the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP's) narrow escape from electoral defeat at the 2020 general elections.

Based on his team's stellar performance at the 2020 polls Alhaji Iddrisu Sulemana is seeking reelection to consolidate the NPP’s electoral fortunes in the region.

Profile

In 2019 Alhaji Iddrisu Sulemana alias Professor Kalamonia was overwhelmingly elected at the Regional Delegates Conference and secured a resounding victory of 70.4% of the total valid votes cast.

He is a business tycoon and the first ever Regional Chairman of the newly created Savannah Region.

He operates the largest photo studio in Northern Ghana and he is also into the commercial transport business.

He is a native of Daboya capital of the North Gonja district. His political journey started during his secondary school days.",,,,,,,,,,,,
NWSA,News Corp,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9jb21tZW50aXNmcmVlLzIwMjIvbWF5LzA3L2ZveC1uZXctZGVhbHMtaW4ta3JlbWxpbi1wcm9wYWdhbmRhLWZyZWV6ZS1ydXBlcnQtbXVyZG9jaHMtYXNzZXRz0gF3aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2NvbW1lbnRpc2ZyZWUvMjAyMi9tYXkvMDcvZm94LW5ldy1kZWFscy1pbi1rcmVtbGluLXByb3BhZ2FuZGEtZnJlZXplLXJ1cGVydC1tdXJkb2Nocy1hc3NldHM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fox News deals in Kremlin propaganda. So why not freeze Rupert Murdoch’s assets?,"If the west could find the courage it would order an immediate freeze of Rupert Murdoch’s assets. His Fox News presenters and Russia’s propagandists are so intermeshed that separating the two is as impossible as unbaking a cake.

On Russian state news as on Fox bawling ideologues scream threats then whine about their victimhood as they incite anger and self-pity in equal measures. Its arguments range from the appropriation of anti-fascism by Greater Russian imperialists – the 40 countries supporting Ukraine were “today’s collective Hitler” viewers were told last week – to the apocalyptic delirium of the boss of RT (Russia Today) Margarita Simonyan. Nuclear war is my “horror” she shuddered “but we will go to heaven while they will simply croak”.

Russia would never give genuine western journalists airtime. But it can always find a slot for its favourite quisling: Fox News’s Tucker Carlson. He pushes out Russian propaganda lines or perhaps creates his own lies for Russia to use. Ukraine not Russia is the real tyranny. Nato provoked poor Vladimir Putin. The west is plotting to use biological weapons. Last week he floated the theory that the war was not the result of an unprovoked invasion by a colonialist dictatorship but of the Biden administration’s desire to avenge Donald Trump’s victory in 2016.

It was a big hit in Moscow reported BuzzFeed’s Julia Davis. “State TV propagandists loved it so much Russia’s 60 Minutes included it not once but twice in their evening broadcast – neatly bookended by the Kremlin’s war propaganda.”

Putin’s appeal to both the far right and the Chomskyan wing of the far left in Europe and North America is worthy of a study in itself. He was a dream for ultra-reactionaries: a white Christian strongman who was anti-liberal and anti-EU. His victories heralded a world in which might was right and morality was for losers.

In Europe Russia’s atrocities have forced everyone from Arron Banks and Nigel Farage to Marine Le Pen and Matteo Salvini to find urgent reasons to change the subject. In the US there remains a market for Putinism among a large minority of Republican voters. Their yearning for dictatorship as evidenced by the support given to denying legitimate election results and to the fascistic forces that stormed Congress is greater. The hatred of liberals in power is deeper.

Murdoch is boosting Russian morale and conversely undermining Ukrainian resolve by supplying a dictatorship with foreign validation. Do not underestimate its importance. Russians who suspect their TV anchors are state-sponsored bootlickers are more likely to believe foreign commentators who assure them that the lies they are hearing are true. Reporters risk their lives but Putin cannot fire or imprison Fox News presenters steal their wealth or poison them with Novichok. Russian forces will not reduce their towns to rubble rape them torture them burn them alive in theatres or shoot them in the head by the side of forest roads. Murdoch and his employees have nothing to fear from Putin. Their endorsement of Kremlin war propaganda carries conviction because it is freely given.

Murdoch boosts Russian morale and undermines Ukrainian resolve by supplying a dictatorship with foreign validation

As useful to Russia is the wider chilling effect. I have seen journalists start off making eloquent and plausible critiques of the left’s hatred of free speech for instance or its tolerance of regressive religion only to find that careers in the worst of the rightwing media come with a price tag. To succeed on Fox News in the US they don’t have to agree with banning abortion or denying climate change but they must never make their objections public.

The UK’s sanctions regulations include among the reasons for freezing an oligarch’s assets “obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia”. The Biden White House promises to punish those “responsible for providing the support necessary to underpin Putin’s war on Ukraine”. On both interpretations there is a plausible prosecution case for freezing the assets of Murdoch’s NewsCorp.

Because it is a media conglomerate sanctions would be an attack on free speech. I say this plainly because so many writers and political actors pretend that they are not demanding censorship when that is precisely what they are doing. Nevertheless in this case the threat to freedom is minimal. Murdoch would not be punished for revealing embarrassing truths about the west but for spreading demonstrable lies for a hostile foreign power.

If you still feel queasy imagine if Murdoch’s media organisation were exactly as it is today and producing the same arguments the Kremlin uses to justify its crimes. The one difference is that Murdoch is Russian rather than Australian. I don’t believe there would be the slightest hesitation in removing him and his family from control of their businesses. Indeed the UK EU and US have already announced sanctions against Russian broadcasters and individual journalists. I have not heard anyone claim that they are attacking press freedom rather than trying to cripple the propaganda capacity of a warmongering state.

The Murdoch empire contains the Times and Wall Street Journal whose Russian coverage has been admirable and HarperCollins which with a bravery few other publishers would match fought off a vicious legal assault by the Russian oligarchy and their pet London lawyers against a critical study of Putin’s power.

But good deeds count for nothing in assessing the desirability of sanctions. The tycoon Oleg Tinkov spoke for many rich Russians when he denounced the “massacre” in Ukraine and called for an end to the “crazy war”. The oligarchs the west has sanctioned are losing their fortunes and what little influence they had. Of course they hate Putin’s strategy. Western governments don’t care because as Tom Keatinge of the Royal United Services Institute explains it to me they know that a large portion of oligarchical wealth is at Putin’s disposal. Their private thoughts and when they dare risk assassination attempts public protests are irrelevant. The need to end war in Europe comes first.

Tender-hearted readers may object that Murdoch is now 90 and may well not be in full control of his organisation. But surely this is an argument for removing him? If in his dotage he is allowing himself to become a cross between Lord Haw Haw and Tokyo Rose it would be a kindness for western governments to save him from himself.

In 2022 News Corporation is confronting Australia with this question once again as it did in 2019 2016 and 2013 and as it did in the United States in 2016 and 2020.

“Going rogue” here means abandoning any attempt at fulfilling one of the media’s primary obligations to a democratic society — the provision of truthful news coverage — and instead becoming a truth-distorting propagandist for one side.

The evidence that News Corp has gone rogue during the current federal election is plentiful. It can be seen every morning in its newspapers across the country and every evening on Sky News after dark.

A sample of its election coverage over the period April 27 to May 2 makes the case.

On May 2 the Daily Telegraph in Sydney devoted its front page to a publicity puff for Katherine Deves the Liberal candidate for Tony Abbott’s old seat of Warringah.

Deves is campaigning to have transgender women banned from sport but has had to apologise twice as statements by her have emerged claiming “half of all males with trans identities are sex offenders” and likening her view on the issue to standing up to Nazis.

The Telegraph splashed the headline “They are all with me” alongside a photo of a smiling Deves pushing the argument that “the silent majority” supported her position. Rowan Dean on Sky went so far as to say this could win the election for the government.

On May 1 the Herald Sun in Melbourne turned its front page into a campaign poster for Josh Frydenberg. According to the headline Frydenberg was in the “fight of his life” to retain Robert Menzies’ old seat of Kooyong against a “teal” independent Monique Ryan.

Inside the paper produced a double-page spread promoting Frydenberg with the banner headline “Why you need to vote for me” reportedly lifted straight from a Liberal campaign advertisement.

Pictures of his wife and children featured prominently in this piece of rank propaganda.

Meanwhile on Sky after dark the big guns Andrew Bolt Peta Credlin and Paul Murray kept up a relentless barrage of pro-Liberal anti-Labor and anti-teal propaganda.

Bolt picked up on a Scott Morrison jibe about Labor’s policy on the Solomon Islands saying it involved sending the ABC to head off China in the south Pacific.

Over the week it was part of an eclectic contribution from Bolt touching on Hong Kong border protection male birth control and a new twist on the concept of climate denialism. On Bolt’s planet increasing power prices are the result of “being in denial” by thinking coal-fired power stations can be replaced by wind and solar energy.

Credlin also spent a lot of time on climate but had a quite different take. Having re-run a Liberal attack ad saying Labor is proposing a carbon tax she went on to say the Coalition is divided more fundamentally than Labor on climate.

To her obvious chagrin the Liberal Party had allowed itself to be distracted by this and by identity wars a clear reference to the Deves problem and she conceded the government was “a little bit shop-soiled”.

But Credlin’s main targets were the teal independents – women candidates standing on a platform of climate action integrity and gender equality against Liberal incumbents in seats such as Goldstein and Kooyong in Melbourne and Wentworth and North Sydney in Sydney.

Their sheer impertinence made her cross.

It meant she said the “hard heads” at Liberal campaign headquarters were having to spend time and money defending Liberal seats that “by right” they should not have to defend. In other words the Liberal Party was entitled to occupy these seats without serious challenge.

Then there was Murray presenting himself as “the last line of defence for common sense”.

In this role he was running a countdown: by the evening of May 2 there were only 19 days left to “save the country from the mad left”.

When a Labor figure Nicholas Reece tried to argue the cost of Labor’s election promises was dwarfed by the debt run up by the present government Murray shouted him down saying “I’m not interested.”

Murray also asserted without a shred of evidence that Labor and the Greens had struck a power-sharing deal so in the event of a hung parliament Labor would govern with the Greens’ support. This added up to the fact that “Labor and the Greens are the same thing”.

The lesser lights on Sky such as Chris Smith Chris Kenny and others made their own toxic contributions using words such as “fraud” “sewer” and “spewing” in crude attacks on the teal independents.

And so it went for the whole week: propaganda distortions crudity and pro-Liberal apologia.

A fraud on the people

This abandonment of a fundamental news media obligation to truth-telling is by definition harmful to a democratic society. Not only does it rob the population of a bedrock of reliable news it debases the entire discourse. It is also a fraud on the people by misrepresenting propaganda as news.

AAP/Bianca de Marchi

The dilemma facing a democracy is that measures needed to counter these harms would violate free-speech principles to a degree that would harm democracy in a different way.

Any abridgement of free speech must be proportional to the harm that is sought to be avoided. How that balance might be struck in a case like this is highly contestable on political as well as ethical grounds.

Yet existing measures are clearly ineffectual. The broadcast industry’s codes of practice for television and radio require news programs to be accurate and fair – but give no guidance on what this consists of. Current affairs programs are exempt even from this requirement.

The broadcast regulator the Australian Communication and Media Authority is a “co-regulator” that has shown itself to be utterly captured by the industry it is meant to hold to account.

Newspapers are accountable to the Australian Press Council but it has proved just as ineffectual as the ACMA. In any case it is fatally compromised by being reliant on funding from the newspaper companies among which the largest contributor is News Corporation.

All efforts to establish an effective independent media accountability body have foundered on the rock of implacable opposition from the commercial media organisations.

Yet even if one were to be established the dilemma would remain: what standards would strike the right balance and how would they be enforced during an election campaign in ways that did not unreasonably burden free speech?

In the end democracies are thrown back on conventions which provide the boundaries within which politics operates in ways conducive to the public good.

The conventions depend on people in power including those running media organisations living up to the responsibilities that their role in a democracy imposes on them.

By convention those responsibilities include prioritising the public interest over the private interests of media organisations and their owners and providing news content calculated to inform not repel the voting public.

News Corporation fails on both counts.

It prioritises the understood financial and ideological interests of one man Rupert Murdoch over the public interest and its toxic news content is calculated to reinforce the worldview of its target audiences.

If News Corp were merely an online echo chamber this would be bad enough but it is not.

AAP/AP/Mary Altaffer

The ready availability of its newspapers to the population as a whole and the spread of its Sky after dark content beyond the confines of pay television into regional free-to-air services make it a far more damaging influence than any online filter bubble.

WIN and Southern Cross Austereo the companies that carry the Sky content on free-to-air TV into regional Australia are complicit in inflicting this damage on the Australian polity. They too have abandoned their conventional responsibilities.

In an age where communications businesses are enjoined to “move fast and break things” breaking these conventions risks breaking democracy itself.

So why not freeze Rupert Murdoch’s assets?,"If the west could find the courage it would order an immediate freeze of Rupert Murdoch’s assets. His Fox News presenters and Russia’s propagandists are so intermeshed that separating the two is as impossible as unbaking a cake.

On Russian state news as on Fox bawling ideologues scream threats then whine about their victimhood as they incite anger and self-pity in equal measures. Its arguments range from the appropriation of anti-fascism by Greater Russian imperialists – the 40 countries supporting Ukraine were “today’s collective Hitler” viewers were told last week – to the apocalyptic delirium of the boss of RT (Russia Today) Margarita Simonyan. Nuclear war is my “horror” she shuddered “but we will go to heaven while they will simply croak”.

Russia would never give genuine western journalists airtime. But it can always find a slot for its favourite quisling: Fox News’s Tucker Carlson. He pushes out Russian propaganda lines or perhaps creates his own lies for Russia to use. Ukraine not Russia is the real tyranny. Nato provoked poor Vladimir Putin. The west is plotting to use biological weapons. Last week he floated the theory that the war was not the result of an unprovoked invasion by a colonialist dictatorship but of the Biden administration’s desire to avenge Donald Trump’s victory in 2016.

It was a big hit in Moscow reported BuzzFeed’s Julia Davis. “State TV propagandists loved it so much Russia’s 60 Minutes included it not once but twice in their evening broadcast – neatly bookended by the Kremlin’s war propaganda.”

Putin’s appeal to both the far right and the Chomskyan wing of the far left in Europe and North America is worthy of a study in itself. He was a dream for ultra-reactionaries: a white Christian strongman who was anti-liberal and anti-EU. His victories heralded a world in which might was right and morality was for losers.

In Europe Russia’s atrocities have forced everyone from Arron Banks and Nigel Farage to Marine Le Pen and Matteo Salvini to find urgent reasons to change the subject. In the US there remains a market for Putinism among a large minority of Republican voters. Their yearning for dictatorship as evidenced by the support given to denying legitimate election results and to the fascistic forces that stormed Congress is greater. The hatred of liberals in power is deeper.

Murdoch is boosting Russian morale and conversely undermining Ukrainian resolve by supplying a dictatorship with foreign validation. Do not underestimate its importance. Russians who suspect their TV anchors are state-sponsored bootlickers are more likely to believe foreign commentators who assure them that the lies they are hearing are true. Reporters risk their lives but Putin cannot fire or imprison Fox News presenters steal their wealth or poison them with Novichok. Russian forces will not reduce their towns to rubble rape them torture them burn them alive in theatres or shoot them in the head by the side of forest roads. Murdoch and his employees have nothing to fear from Putin. Their endorsement of Kremlin war propaganda carries conviction because it is freely given.

Murdoch boosts Russian morale and undermines Ukrainian resolve by supplying a dictatorship with foreign validation

As useful to Russia is the wider chilling effect. I have seen journalists start off making eloquent and plausible critiques of the left’s hatred of free speech for instance or its tolerance of regressive religion only to find that careers in the worst of the rightwing media come with a price tag. To succeed on Fox News in the US they don’t have to agree with banning abortion or denying climate change but they must never make their objections public.

The UK’s sanctions regulations include among the reasons for freezing an oligarch’s assets “obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia”. The Biden White House promises to punish those “responsible for providing the support necessary to underpin Putin’s war on Ukraine”. On both interpretations there is a plausible prosecution case for freezing the assets of Murdoch’s NewsCorp.

Because it is a media conglomerate sanctions would be an attack on free speech. I say this plainly because so many writers and political actors pretend that they are not demanding censorship when that is precisely what they are doing. Nevertheless in this case the threat to freedom is minimal. Murdoch would not be punished for revealing embarrassing truths about the west but for spreading demonstrable lies for a hostile foreign power.

If you still feel queasy imagine if Murdoch’s media organisation were exactly as it is today and producing the same arguments the Kremlin uses to justify its crimes. The one difference is that Murdoch is Russian rather than Australian. I don’t believe there would be the slightest hesitation in removing him and his family from control of their businesses. Indeed the UK EU and US have already announced sanctions against Russian broadcasters and individual journalists. I have not heard anyone claim that they are attacking press freedom rather than trying to cripple the propaganda capacity of a warmongering state.

The Murdoch empire contains the Times and Wall Street Journal whose Russian coverage has been admirable and HarperCollins which with a bravery few other publishers would match fought off a vicious legal assault by the Russian oligarchy and their pet London lawyers against a critical study of Putin’s power.

But good deeds count for nothing in assessing the desirability of sanctions. The tycoon Oleg Tinkov spoke for many rich Russians when he denounced the “massacre” in Ukraine and called for an end to the “crazy war”. The oligarchs the west has sanctioned are losing their fortunes and what little influence they had. Of course they hate Putin’s strategy. Western governments don’t care because as Tom Keatinge of the Royal United Services Institute explains it to me they know that a large portion of oligarchical wealth is at Putin’s disposal. Their private thoughts and when they dare risk assassination attempts public protests are irrelevant. The need to end war in Europe comes first.

Tender-hearted readers may object that Murdoch is now 90 and may well not be in full control of his organisation. But surely this is an argument for removing him? If in his dotage he is allowing himself to become a cross between Lord Haw Haw and Tokyo Rose it would be a kindness for western governments to save him from himself.

In 2022 News Corporation is confronting Australia with this question once again as it did in 2019 2016 and 2013 and as it did in the United States in 2016 and 2020.

“Going rogue” here means abandoning any attempt at fulfilling one of the media’s primary obligations to a democratic society — the provision of truthful news coverage — and instead becoming a truth-distorting propagandist for one side.

The evidence that News Corp has gone rogue during the current federal election is plentiful. It can be seen every morning in its newspapers across the country and every evening on Sky News after dark.

A sample of its election coverage over the period April 27 to May 2 makes the case.

On May 2 the Daily Telegraph in Sydney devoted its front page to a publicity puff for Katherine Deves the Liberal candidate for Tony Abbott’s old seat of Warringah.

Deves is campaigning to have transgender women banned from sport but has had to apologise twice as statements by her have emerged claiming “half of all males with trans identities are sex offenders” and likening her view on the issue to standing up to Nazis.

The Telegraph splashed the headline “They are all with me” alongside a photo of a smiling Deves pushing the argument that “the silent majority” supported her position. Rowan Dean on Sky went so far as to say this could win the election for the government.

On May 1 the Herald Sun in Melbourne turned its front page into a campaign poster for Josh Frydenberg. According to the headline Frydenberg was in the “fight of his life” to retain Robert Menzies’ old seat of Kooyong against a “teal” independent Monique Ryan.

Inside the paper produced a double-page spread promoting Frydenberg with the banner headline “Why you need to vote for me” reportedly lifted straight from a Liberal campaign advertisement.

Pictures of his wife and children featured prominently in this piece of rank propaganda.

Meanwhile on Sky after dark the big guns Andrew Bolt Peta Credlin and Paul Murray kept up a relentless barrage of pro-Liberal anti-Labor and anti-teal propaganda.

Bolt picked up on a Scott Morrison jibe about Labor’s policy on the Solomon Islands saying it involved sending the ABC to head off China in the south Pacific.

Over the week it was part of an eclectic contribution from Bolt touching on Hong Kong border protection male birth control and a new twist on the concept of climate denialism. On Bolt’s planet increasing power prices are the result of “being in denial” by thinking coal-fired power stations can be replaced by wind and solar energy.

Credlin also spent a lot of time on climate but had a quite different take. Having re-run a Liberal attack ad saying Labor is proposing a carbon tax she went on to say the Coalition is divided more fundamentally than Labor on climate.

To her obvious chagrin the Liberal Party had allowed itself to be distracted by this and by identity wars a clear reference to the Deves problem and she conceded the government was “a little bit shop-soiled”.

But Credlin’s main targets were the teal independents – women candidates standing on a platform of climate action integrity and gender equality against Liberal incumbents in seats such as Goldstein and Kooyong in Melbourne and Wentworth and North Sydney in Sydney.

Their sheer impertinence made her cross.

It meant she said the “hard heads” at Liberal campaign headquarters were having to spend time and money defending Liberal seats that “by right” they should not have to defend. In other words the Liberal Party was entitled to occupy these seats without serious challenge.

Then there was Murray presenting himself as “the last line of defence for common sense”.

In this role he was running a countdown: by the evening of May 2 there were only 19 days left to “save the country from the mad left”.

When a Labor figure Nicholas Reece tried to argue the cost of Labor’s election promises was dwarfed by the debt run up by the present government Murray shouted him down saying “I’m not interested.”

Murray also asserted without a shred of evidence that Labor and the Greens had struck a power-sharing deal so in the event of a hung parliament Labor would govern with the Greens’ support. This added up to the fact that “Labor and the Greens are the same thing”.

The lesser lights on Sky such as Chris Smith Chris Kenny and others made their own toxic contributions using words such as “fraud” “sewer” and “spewing” in crude attacks on the teal independents.

And so it went for the whole week: propaganda distortions crudity and pro-Liberal apologia.

A fraud on the people

This abandonment of a fundamental news media obligation to truth-telling is by definition harmful to a democratic society. Not only does it rob the population of a bedrock of reliable news it debases the entire discourse. It is also a fraud on the people by misrepresenting propaganda as news.

AAP/Bianca de Marchi

The dilemma facing a democracy is that measures needed to counter these harms would violate free-speech principles to a degree that would harm democracy in a different way.

Any abridgement of free speech must be proportional to the harm that is sought to be avoided. How that balance might be struck in a case like this is highly contestable on political as well as ethical grounds.

Yet existing measures are clearly ineffectual. The broadcast industry’s codes of practice for television and radio require news programs to be accurate and fair – but give no guidance on what this consists of. Current affairs programs are exempt even from this requirement.

The broadcast regulator the Australian Communication and Media Authority is a “co-regulator” that has shown itself to be utterly captured by the industry it is meant to hold to account.

Newspapers are accountable to the Australian Press Council but it has proved just as ineffectual as the ACMA. In any case it is fatally compromised by being reliant on funding from the newspaper companies among which the largest contributor is News Corporation.

All efforts to establish an effective independent media accountability body have foundered on the rock of implacable opposition from the commercial media organisations.

Yet even if one were to be established the dilemma would remain: what standards would strike the right balance and how would they be enforced during an election campaign in ways that did not unreasonably burden free speech?

In the end democracies are thrown back on conventions which provide the boundaries within which politics operates in ways conducive to the public good.

The conventions depend on people in power including those running media organisations living up to the responsibilities that their role in a democracy imposes on them.

By convention those responsibilities include prioritising the public interest over the private interests of media organisations and their owners and providing news content calculated to inform not repel the voting public.

News Corporation fails on both counts.

It prioritises the understood financial and ideological interests of one man Rupert Murdoch over the public interest and its toxic news content is calculated to reinforce the worldview of its target audiences.

If News Corp were merely an online echo chamber this would be bad enough but it is not.

AAP/AP/Mary Altaffer

The ready availability of its newspapers to the population as a whole and the spread of its Sky after dark content beyond the confines of pay television into regional free-to-air services make it a far more damaging influence than any online filter bubble.

WIN and Southern Cross Austereo the companies that carry the Sky content on free-to-air TV into regional Australia are complicit in inflicting this damage on the Australian polity. They too have abandoned their conventional responsibilities.

In an age where communications businesses are enjoined to “move fast and break things” breaking these conventions risks breaking democracy itself.

What does that money buy?,"Oil and gas companies put thousands of dollars every year into New Mexico’s political campaigns on both sides of the aisle seeking to influence policy to protect continued growth in the industry that represents about a third of the state’s budget.

That amounted to about $1.1 million in political contributions between Oct. 5 2021 and April 4 per a report from New Mexico Ethics Watch leading up to the 2022 Mid-term Election.

The latest chunk of change came in a year when New Mexicans could choose a new governor and the three top candidates in that race were the state’s biggest recipients of oil and gas’ dollars.

Mark Ronchetti a former weatherman seeking the GOP nomination for governor got the most with $300000 coming to his campaign from oil and gas during the latest six-month reporting period read the report followed by Republican State Rep. Rebecca Dow with $122000.

While Republicans are typically viewed as the party with more support for oil and gas Democrat incumbent Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham was the third-highest recipient of oil and gas money in the state the report read with about $60000.

That means gubernatorial candidates got about $500000 almost half of the $1.1 million provide by oil and gas as the industry sought a seat at the table in the race for New Mexico’s highest-ranking political office.

""The oil and gas industry plays an outsized role in the economic fortunes of New Mexico and we believe citizens need to be aware of the industry's continuing influence upon our public officials” said Ethics Watch Executive Director Kathleen Sabo.

Spokesperson for Lujan Grisham's campaign Kendall Witmer denied that campaign donations from the oil and gas industry impacted the governor's decision making touting Lujan Grisham's record on environmental policy and

""Governor Lujan Grisham’s commitment to New Mexico is evidenced by her tireless work to make New Mexico a leader in economic growth by supporting legacy industries and investing in new ones leading the nation in tackling climate and clean energy technologies and investing resources in local communities"" Witmer said.

""Campaign donations have no effect on policy and to imply otherwise is a disservice to the groundbreaking work made by the Governor local public officials industry leaders and communities.""

Overall about 70 percent of oil and gas contributions went to Republicans per the report compared with 60 percent paid to the party in 2020.

That money came from some of the biggest oil companies in the world records show as they focus on the prolific Permian Basin in the southeast corner of New Mexico amid global supply shortfalls on the heels of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and growing demand as the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to subside.

Chevron led with $71000 in campaign contributions between October 2021 and April 2022 followed Artesia-based Santo Petroleum with $66000.

Occidental Petroleum was third with $60413 in contributions the report read and ExxonMobil was fourth with $60000.

Other top contributions from the oil and gas industry were JR Water Transfer’s $50000 NextEra Energy Resources’ $41500 and $37850 from ConocoPhillips.

Another $36200 came from Devon Energy followed by $35800 from the Trust of John A. Yates founder of Yates Petroleum and Marathon Oil Company with $30000 per the report.

Political Action Committees associated with oil and gas contributed another $51000 to the state’s political campaigns per the report while receiving about $260000 from the industry.

About $135000 of that was donated the report read to the New Mexico House Republican Campaign Committee.

Oil county Republicans support oil and gas' role in state politics

State Sen. David Gallegos of Eunice along New Mexico’s eastern border to Texas in Lea County of the oil-rich Permian Basin region said the industry deserves the influence it pays for as a major driver of the state’s economy.

“They’re a large donor to the state as a whole. What we do to oil and gas hurts everyone” he said. “I think it’s fair. We determine the fate of their industry or their demise. They’re a major player in the room and they deserve a major seat in the room.”

Gallegos said he was concerned the industry’s backing of Democrat candidates might not get the return he said oil and gas hoped for.

“If you butter both sides of the bread someone’s hands get dirty” he said. “I think they (oil and gas) are trying to put an investment in to protect themselves. I don’t think it’s really worked. On the Republican side we know the value of oil and gas.”

Artesia State Rep. Jim Townsend of Eddy County also in the Permian pointed to economic prosperity and jobs created by oil and gas in New Mexico arguing it's interests should represented as they mirror those of many New Mexicans.

""You’re talking about an industry that provides almost half to the state gross domestic product. It is a significant industry"" Townsend said. ""Oil and gas is a significant employer. The jobs of representatives and employers are to represent their districts.

""We are very fortunate to live in an area that is blessed with bountiful resources. We don’t have anything else that back-fill that.""

Is oil and gas threatened by government policy?

Critics of the industry questioned if the value oil and gas brought into New Mexico’s economy would truly be harmed by recent policy decisions.

A report authored by New Mexico economist Kelly O’Donnell analyzed the impact recently proposed reforms on federal oil and gas policy would have on the state’ revenue.

When he took office in 2019 the administration of President Joe Biden placed a moratorium on new federal oil and gas leases nationwide as the Department of the Interior conducted a review of its fossil fuel programs.

In the years since the DOI implemented policy shifts to account more for environmental and climate change impacts of extraction on public land.

About half of New Mexico’s oil and gas operations occur on federal land and industry leaders were widely critical of the federal policy as threatening the state’s economy and its role in the nation’s energy security.

But O’Donnell in the report argued such policy shifts would have no bearing on oil and gas prices which drive production and revenue to the state.

Most of the provisions only apply to new leases the report read and 90 percent of New Mexico’s federal leases or already in production meaning any changes were unlikely to impact present operations.

An increase of federal royalties companies pay on their operations from 12.5 percent to 16.67 percent O’Donnell said would also only apply to new leases and have a “negligible” effect on production costs.

“Congress and the Department of Interior are weighing a variety of reforms that could impact operators on federal land in New Mexico however my analysis shows these impacts would be minimal to state revenue” O’Donnell said.

“Despite claims by the industry and its allies these reforms will have no impact on gas prices and pose little threat to oil and gas production in New Mexico which is expected to continue rising in the coming decade.”

It would have been a reality if it wasn’t for Michael Jordan’s mother Deloris’ intervention.

In the docuseries “The Last Dance” Jordan explained how his mother was the reason he signed with Nike. Michael had always worn Adidas sneakers during his college career. MJ revealed that he was about to sign with Adidas and wasn’t even thinking about hearing Nike’s offer. But his mother Deloris insisted that he listened to the offer from Nike. Jordan obliged and here we are.

Jordan made less than $100 million from his NBA salary. His contract with Nike was an integral part of his present business empire. While Michael helped popularise Nike as the face of the brand it opened up multiple opportunities for MJ.

Michael was the first athlete to be a billionaire and has an estimated net worth of $1.6 billion. The success of Air Jordan knows no borders. While many athletes tried to follow suit with their own brand none was as successful as Jordan.

Michael Jordan and Nike’s partnership

The partnership between Michael Jordan and Nike started out just as a contract between a player and a brand. But it has evolved into something great and changed the industry for good.

And it proved to be a profitable partnership not just for MJ but for Nike too. It is estimated that Jordan earns $130 Million a year from sales of Air Jordan sneakers and apparel. The Air Jordan brand has a revenue of around $3 Billion a year according to Business Insider.

Even though it was a risk at the time Nike tied up Jordan to a unique contract. The deal was to allow the Chicago Bulls star to make his own line of sneakers. Initially the Air Jordan shoes were made only for Michael. It was only later that Air Jordan sneakers were released to the public.

During a time when only white sneakers were allowed in the NBA the Air Jordan sneakers were banned for their red and black features. And the league fined $5000 every time Michael wore the sneakers in a game.

With stores temporarily closed at various times throughout the past couple of years Nike's (NKE 0.45%) business was severely impacted. A year-over-year sales increase of 5% in the fiscal 2022 third quarter (ended Feb. 28) shows that the company is continuing to head in the right direction by posting gains.

But ongoing investments the business has made in recent years to bolster its technological foundation are providing a new lever of growth for the world's top athletic apparel brand. Nike currently has more than 300 million members in its booming ecosystem. That massive figure demonstrates the company's digital prowess.

Nike's budding ecosystem

Nike has a full suite of digital apps including the flagship Nike mobile app the SNKRS app Nike Training Club and Nike Running Club. While the last two are activity-based the first two are where customers can shop for the company's products. What's remarkable is that all of these digital apps work together to reinforce and strengthen the company's ecosystem.

For example last year Nike collaborated with hip-hop artist Megan Thee Stallion to create workout content. Nike members who took these exercise classes might have then received emails with personalized recommendations of apparel that was inspired by the musician.

But it doesn't end there. Blending the digital experience with in-store shopping is a key facet of Nike's Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy. New store formats like Nike Live House of Innovation and Nike Rise create a smooth and seamless omnichannel offering. While in stores shoppers can use their Nike app to pull up product information pick items to try on in a dressing room and get one-time discounts to use.

Nike CEO John Donahoe came from eBay so he knows a thing or two about digital commerce. In the most recent quarter digital sales represented 26% of the Nike Brand business. Management's objective is to get this figure to half of total revenue one day which would be a boon for profitability because this channel produces higher margins.

Having a robust digital ecosystem is a key differentiator between Nike and its competitors. The massive amount of data the business collects helps to inform product development and marketing initiatives ultimately driving higher return on investment. And by creating a frictionless and smooth onboarding process more consumers will sign up for Nike's apps in the future. This further allows the company to develop deep connections with its customers an invaluable advantage in today's cutthroat retail environment.

For Nike it's all about the unquestionable power of the brand. As management focuses relentlessly on continuing to integrate technology into the business thus strengthening the digital ecosystem Nike will only become more popular among consumers.

Nike is on a mission to reduce its environmental footprint with two new sneaker models that can be taken apart entirely. This innovation is designed to make recycling quicker and easier in turn cutting down on waste.



It's impossible today for any company in the fashion industry not to address the climate emergency by contributing to reducing the environmental impact of the world's second-most polluting industry. The challenges are numerous as are the initiatives taken by the sector's various brands whether in the world of ready-to-wear or accessories shoes or sportswear. Many are turning to low-impact or recycled raw materials setting up short production circuits limiting the use of water and energy but also reducing waste.





The Swoosh brand which has already proposed a few initiatives in this vein is now innovating with two new shoe models—the Link and the Link Axis—designed to combine performance and sustainability. Nike 's ISPA (Improvise; Scavenge; Protect; Adapt) research team has been working on a circular design process that involves taking apart a product to recycle its components more easily. But is dismantling a sneaker really an easy thing to do? It can be hard to imagine considering that a sneaker is made up of a lot of materials all stuck together.""Designed in partnership with engineering digital product creation and development these shoes are completely informed by method of make— it really is a case of form following function"" says Darryl Matthews VP Catalyst Footwear Product Design at Nike . ""Our hope is that these ideas and aesthetics become normalized accelerating our ability to imagine how shoes will continue to evolve in the future.""Each model is made of not one but three parts that fit together without glue or other materials that can be difficult to recycle. Once worn the shoes can be brought back to stores then taken apart so that each part can be recycled separately according to the material it is made of. The 'Nike ISPA Link' will be the first model to launch in June while the 'Nike ISPA Link Axis' will land early in 2023."

Nhưng công ty ấy lại đang khiến cho toàn bộ ngành năng lượng tái tạo của Mỹ rơi vào hỗn loạn.

""Đơn thương độc mã"" lên tiếng công khai

Một đơn kiện mà Auxin đệ trình lên Bộ Thương mại cáo buộc các công ty Trung Quốc lách thuế đã khiến Mỹ phải mở một cuộc điều tra vào tháng 3. Cuộc điều tra này đã cản trở hầu hết các hoạt động nhập khẩu tấm pin năng lượng mặt trời và làm trì hoãn các dự án năng lượng mặt trời trên khắp nước Mỹ theo các công ty năng lượng cho biết.

Các giám đốc điều hành và chính trị gia về năng lượng bao gồm Thống đốc California Gavin Newsom đã phản đối cảnh báo rằng cuộc điều tra có thể cản trở nỗ lực của Mỹ trong việc chuyển đổi sang các nguồn năng lượng sạch hơn để chống lại biến đổi khí hậu. Thiệt hại mà tình trạng hỗn loạn này gây ra cho ngành công nghiệp được ước tính có thể lên đến hàng tỷ USD.

Hôm thứ Tư NiSource Inc. công ty năng lượng có trụ sở tại Indiana cho biết các dự án năng lượng mặt trời bị chậm trễ tới 18 tháng có nghĩa là họ sẽ phải giữ cho các nhà máy nhiệt điện than phải ngưng hoạt động lâu hơn dự kiến.

Sự gián đoạn đã làm dấy lên những nghi vấn như điều gì đã thúc đẩy Auxin làm như vậy công ty này lấy đâu ra tài trợ cho cuộc chiến pháp lý của mình và có thực sự là họ sản xuất tấm pin thật hay không?

Giám đốc điều hành Auxin Mamun Rashid cho biết trong một cuộc phỏng vấn rằng chính công ty đang tự tài trợ cho bản kiến ​​nghị nhằm tìm cách ngăn chặn các hành vi thương mại không công bằng đã gây tổn hại cho các nhà sản xuất Mỹ. Một chuyến tham quan nhà máy của ông gần đây cho thấy có khoảng 30 công nhân đang sản xuất các tấm pin năng lượng mặt trời.

Ông cho biết kết quả của việc cáo buộc này là các nhân viên của ông đã gặp rắc rối máy tính chủ của ông đã bị tấn công và những chiếc xe kỳ lạ đã chạy vòng quanh nhà máy của ông.

Ông Rashid cũng là một cựu kỹ sư vi mạch ở Thung lũng Silicon. Ông cho biết: ""Có ai đó đã gọi cho tôi vài ngày trước và nói rằng tên tuổi của công ty chúng tôi bị ghét vô cùng trong ngành này."" Trong những năm qua ông đã bán một chiếc Porsche quý giá và tiêu hết quỹ 401(k) của mình để giữ cho công ty năng lượng mặt trời sống sót.

Ông nói thêm: ""Tôi không bao giờ muốn thực hiện một hành động nào gây tổn hại cho ngành năng lượng tái tạo. Nhưng không tuân thủ luật pháp của Mỹ là việc có thể bỏ qua sao?"" Ông cũng nói thêm rằng việc đối mặt với thách thức về khí hậu là điều quan trọng đối với ông.

Một công ty tư nhân có trụ sở tại San Jose California đã phản đối đơn kiện của Auxin nhấn mạnh mức độ phụ thuộc của ngành năng lượng mặt trời Mỹ vào nguồn cung nước ngoài hầu hết được kiểm soát bởi các công ty Trung Quốc. Những công ty này có thể sản xuất khối lượng lớn với giá thành rẻ.

Theo công ty tư vấn năng lượng Wood Mackenzie các nhà sản xuất Trung Quốc tạo ra khoảng 63% polysilicon được sử dụng trong hầu hết các tấm pin năng lượng mặt trời trên toàn cầu và hơn 2/3 số tấm wafer trong quá trình sản xuất.

Trong thập kỷ qua Mỹ đã cố gắng giữ một số ngành sản xuất năng lượng mặt trời ở trong nước bằng cách đánh thuế đối với tế bào quang điện và tấm pin năng lượng mặt trời bao gồm cả thuế suất cao đối với các nhà sản xuất Trung Quốc. Nhưng thay vào đó Trung Quốc được cho là đã chuyển các linh kiện sang các nước Đông Nam Á như Malaysia Thái Lan Việt Nam và Campuchia để lắp ráp trước khi nhập khẩu sang Mỹ.

Tình cảnh hỗn loạn

Năm ngoái một nhóm các nhà sản xuất năng lượng mặt trời của Mỹ đã đệ đơn kiến nghị ẩn danh lên Bộ Thương mại nói rằng các nhà sản xuất Trung Quốc đang trốn tránh thuế quan của Mỹ bằng cách định tuyến hoạt động của họ qua các quốc gia Đông Nam Á.

Sau khi bản kiến ​​nghị đó bị từ chối vì không biết danh tính của những người viết là ai Auxin - một thành viên trong nhóm kiến nghị - đã quyết định thử lại theo cách đơn độc và công khai một người biết về câu chuyện này cho hay.

Ông Rashid cho biết Auxin có doanh thu chưa đến 10 triệu USD vào năm ngoái và đã thu được lợi nhuận nhỏ. Auxin có thể sản xuất 150 megawatt tấm mỗi năm ít hơn những gì mà một dự án năng lượng quy mô lớn thường yêu cầu. Ông Rashid cho biết nó đang hoạt động khoảng 30% công suất đó.

Trong chuyến thăm gần đây đến nhà máy của Auxin nằm trong khu công nghiệp San Jose người ta thấy một số công nhân đang lắp ráp các tấm pin năng lượng mặt trời. Một số máy

Trong chuyến thăm gần đây đến nhà máy của Auxin nằm trong khu công nghiệp San Jose một số công nhân đang lắp ráp các tấm panel. Một số máy được giám sát xâu chuỗi các tế bào quang điện lại với nhau trong khi mọi người đang hàn các bộ phận bằng tay. Các công nhân chuyển các tấm pin đã hoàn thiện qua các máy cán lớn và để nguội trước khi chuyển chúng vào các chồng tấm pin trong một góc tối.

Kể từ khi đơn kiến nghị được trình lên các chuyến hàng từ Đông Nam Á đến Mỹ đã bị tạm dừng theo các nhóm năng lượng và thương mại cho biết. Nguyên do là vì các nhà sản xuất ở nước ngoài lo ngại họ có thể bị đánh thuế bổ sung.

Một nhóm gồm 22 thượng nghị sĩ Mỹ đã gửi một lá thư cho Tổng thống Biden vào Chủ nhật nói rằng cuộc điều tra đang gây ra ""sự gián đoạn lớn trong ngành năng lượng mặt trời"" và yêu cầu nhanh chóng kết thúc vụ việc.

Bộ trưởng Thương mại Gina Raimondo đã nói với một hội đồng của Thượng viện vào tuần trước rằng không thể không giải quyết cáo buộc của đơn khiếu nại nhưng sẽ cố gắng làm điều đó nhanh nhất có thể.

Các công ty điện lực như NextEra Energy Inc. và Xcel Energy Inc. cho biết nhiều dự án năng lượng mặt trời của họ đang phải đối mặt với sự chậm trễ kéo dài hàng tháng. Hiệp hội các ngành công nghiệp năng lượng mặt trời một nhóm thương mại của Mỹ cảnh báo rằng cái mà họ gọi là ""thuế Auxin"" có thể làm giảm 48% việc triển khai năng lượng mặt trời dự kiến ​​trong năm nay.

Himanshu Saxena Giám đốc điều hành của Starwood Energy Group một công ty cổ phần tư nhân tài trợ và phát triển các dự án năng lượng cho biết: ""Ai cũng như đang ngồi trên đống lửa."" Ông lưu ý rằng các nhà phát triển năng lượng mặt trời không thể chắc chắn khi nào họ sẽ nhận được tấm pin hoặc chúng sẽ có giá bao nhiêu.

First Solar Inc. nhà sản xuất năng lượng mặt trời lớn nhất của Mỹ đã công khai lên tiếng ủng hộ Auxin nhưng không phải là ở trong bản kiến ​​nghị. Samantha Sloan phó chủ tịch chính sách của công ty cho biết First Solar sử dụng các vật liệu và quy trình sản xuất khác với hầu hết các nhà sản xuất tấm pin năng lượng mặt trời nên không bị ảnh hưởng bởi thuế quan.

Sự chỉ trích của Auxin cho thấy rằng một số người ""sợ rằng Bộ Thương mại sẽ phát hiện ra rằng các nhà sản xuất năng lượng mặt trời của Trung Quốc trên thực tế đang vi phạm và sẽ buộc họ phải chịu trách nhiệm về các hành vi thương mại không công bằng và bất hợp pháp của mình"" bà Sloan nói.

And governors say the report proves the academy has undergone rapid transformation 'thanks to he relentless application of the trust’s northern model of school improvement'.

They added: ""This coupled with the determination of senior leaders and staff and the support of governors has led to this magnificent achievement for a school which was once struggling.""

The school is run by the Northern Education Trust.

Ofsted inspectors praised the improvements.

Inspectors found that pupils 'benefit from regular praise and encouragement and are supported to be confident and resilient learners'.

The report stated: “Students benefit from regular praise and encouragement and are supported to be confident and resilient learners. They appreciate the help they receive from teachers who have high expectations of what students can and should achieve. And overall students achieve well.”

Young people told inspectors that the strong culture of praise helps them to feel a sense of motivation.

Ofsted commented: ""This can be seen throughout the whole of the academy when students take the initiative and applaud each other’s achievements in lessons and celebrate each other’s work on proud Thursdays.""

Pupils also told inspectors that they feel safe at school and know they can talk to a member of staff if they have any concerns and are happy and proud to attend Kearsley Academy.

Inspectors noted the high expectations that teachers have of student behaviour with students appreciating the fair systems in place to manage this.

As a result students behave well.

The ambitions that leaders have for all students were also noted with leaders ensuring that all students including those with SEND are given the opportunities that they need to succeed.

Inspectors were impressed with the curriculum which ensures that students gain the breadth and depth of knowledge needed across a range of subjects and they praised the fact that the number of students who study the English Baccalaureate is steadily rising year on year.

Executive Principal Dean Buckley said: “We are over the moon that Ofsted recognise the incredible hard work that has been done to improve our school. The children here are wonderful young people and they deserve the very best education we can give them. This judgement reflects the ongoing support commitment and hard work of all involved from students and staff to parents governors and of course Northern Education Trust. We will never become complacent - we will keep on doing all that we can do to enhance the life chances of the children and young people in our care.”

Rob Tarn Chief Executive added: “I am delighted and proud that Ofsted have seen and acknowledged the improvements that have taken place to make Kearsley Academy a good school. This could not have been achieved without the dedicated support and commitment of trustees governors and staff. A special thanks goes to our wonderful students for their hard work and their families for their support.",,,,,,,,,
NOC,Northrop Grumman,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2FzcGFjZWZsaWdodC5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS9pbnRlbHNhdHZpLW1ydi1tZXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,30 years after Intelsat VI rescue Northrop Grumman aims to make in-space servicing a permanent reality ...,"On 7 May 1992 Space Shuttle Endeavour lifted off on her first voyage at 23:40 UTC from Pad-B at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Her target: Intelsat VI F-3 (now known as Intelsat 603). The goal: rendezvous with repair and re-release the satellite.

In the now-30 years since that mission on-orbit satellite repair and servicing have largely languished — save for the five Hubble servicing missions Endeavour and the Shuttle fleet would conduct after STS-49.

Northrop Grumman now aims to change that in 2024 when their new Mission Robotic Vehicle and Mission Extension Pods begin launching to perform on-orbit satellite servicing and repairs.

Endeavour’s first mission and a look to the future

One of the selling points of the Space Shuttle system was its ability to not just allow large payloads and satellites to be launched at one time but that the vehicle was capable of finally enabling on-orbit rescue repair and servicing of satellites.

This was in reality only accomplished a few times in the Shuttle program’s history. But on 7 May 1992 Endeavour stood ready for the STS-49 voyage to do just that.

Setting the stage for the flight Intelsat VI F-3 was launched on a Titan III rocket on 14 March 1990 and stranded in low Earth orbit when the rocket’s Orbus-21S upper stage failed to separate from Titan III’s second stage.

Intelsat not wanting to throw away a perfectly good satellite that just needed a new Orbus-21S perigee kick stage to get it into its intended geostationary transfer orbit went to NASA and purchased a Shuttle rescue mission.

Endeavour launched two years and two months after Intelsat VI F-3 rendezvousing with the craft three times due to failures to capture the satellite using the intended two-person spacewalk to attach a capture bar to it.

On the third rendezvous attempt the first and to-date only three-person spacewalk took place allowing for the successful capture of Intelsat VI F-3 as the mission’s commander delicately flew Endeavour in station-keeping with the satellite.

The crew then attached the new perigee kick motor and re-released the satellite into orbit where the motor successfully fired.

The satellite then used its thrusters to fully raise itself to geostationary orbit (GEO) on 21 May 1992 — just over a week after it was rescued in low Earth orbit. It operated in GEO until January 2013 with Intelsat confirming its retirement and placement in a GEO graveyard orbit in February 2015.

Working the STS-49 mission for Intelsat was a newly hired engineer Joe Anderson — now the Vice President of SpaceLogistics a Northrop Grumman company — and one of the people deeply involved in making on-orbit serving rescue and repair of satellites commonplace.

“I was a young engineer at the time [of STS-49]” related Anderson in an interview with NASASpaceflight. “I had joined Intelsat just a few weeks before the launch of Endeavour and I walked right into the operations center and was part of the mission team for Intelsat managing the operations of the 603 satellite as it was being rescued.”

Specifically Anderson was the attitude control engineer for the rescue making sure the satellite was spun down properly so the astronauts could grab it and attach the capture bar. He also made sure the satellite’s orientation was stable and that all of its thrusters were disabled as Endeavour approached and conducted station-keeping operations.

Following the mission Anderson’s career never really took him away from the idea of satellite servicing — even if his day-to-day operations changed.

“After that I was a spacecraft engineer. I assisted in the design operation and then eventually the decommissioning of dozens of satellites. And I use the term ‘grave digger’ here because I’ve been tasked with driving these otherwise healthy satellites to their demise out in a graveyard orbit just because they ran out of fuel. But the satellite was still working fine” Anderson related.

“It just felt like there had to be a better way of doing that.”

Ten years ago Anderson became aware of a program at Northrop Grumman for Mission Extension Vehicles (MEVs) which as the name implies are designed to extend the life of a satellite in orbit. “I liked it so much I decided to join them to help make it a reality” said Anderson.

But there were many hurdles to overcome.

“As the leading innovator here to bring this commercial service to market we had to perfect the technical concept around the docking. That was a big thing to do. But we also had to build and finance our business model to make it a true commercial service.”

“It was also hard to establish a regulatory regime to license this new space capability because it wasn’t something that could be licensed when we started. We had to invent new forms of insurance to cover losses for these sorts of things. And then we had to identify our customers that had the vision and the technical skills to help us safely bring this new capability to market” noted Anderson.

Come forward several years in the Mission Extension Vehicles development process and the first in-space customer for the crafts ended up being Anderson’s previous employer: Intelsat.

Presently the first two MEVs are attached to Intelsats 901 and 10-02 respectively. These satellites were running out of fuel but were otherwise still fully operational.

However despite the success of the Mission Extension Vehicles program there’s a catch. The MEVs can only help one satellite at a time and they can only extend a satellite’s life by using the Mission Extension Vehicle’s fuel; they can’t service or repair satellites. And with five-year life-extension service contracts for the MEVs the need for more immediate quick and rapid servicing became a priority.

“What we wanted to do was find a solution where we could extend many satellites and at a much much better price point for our customers” added Anderson. “And so in looking at that trying to figure out ‘How do we do that?’ we looked at refueling these satellites that were not prepared [for that] when [they were] launched 10 years ago.”

“We came to the conclusion that that was probably a risk that was just too great for customers to accept: to try to refuel satellites that were not designed [for that]. So we found another solution which was essentially to put on just a small propulsion augmentation device that we now call a Mission Extension Pod.”

While not all satellites are built the same in terms of their platform (bus) and overall design about 80% of satellites in geostationary orbit share two common features that the MEVs Mission Robotic Vehicles and Mission Extension Pods can use as attachment points: a liquid apogee engine and a launch adaptor ring.

The first two MEVs used their target satellites’ liquid apogee engines to achieve docking.

But even with this capability are customers showing up for the service? Are they seeing the benefit of servicing satellites on-orbit instead of building newer more advanced ones to replace them?

According to Anderson the answer is yes. “The reaction from the industry has been very good. We’ve been getting regular calls from operators asking for the service capability. A lot of those calls are looking for something in the next year or two.”

“And so right now that’s indicating that this was a kind of ‘build it and they will come’ market.”

For the Mission Robotic Vehicles and Mission Extension Pods the first signed contract for their use is with Optus with a launch slated for 2024. Additionally five other signed term sheets (with active work progressing toward signed contracts) with other potential customers for the installation of Mission Extension Pods onto satellites in geostationary orbit out through 2026 are in work.

With the first Mission Robotic Vehicle launch three Mission Extension Pods will be co-manifested as well. Once dropped off in low Earth orbit the Mission Robotic Vehicle and each Mission Extension Pod will individually raise their orbits to the geostationary orbit belt and toward their respective satellites.

The Mission Extension Pods will position themselves near their targets and then wait for the Mission Robotic Vehicle to arrive. Once the Mission Robotic Vehicle is at its first target it will grapple the waiting Mission Extention Pod with its robotic arm maneuver to the target satellite and install the MEP.

Once installation is complete the Mission Robotic Vehicle will then move on to its next target satellite where it will repeat the process.

Meanwhile additional Mission Extension Pods will be launched and begin the process of raising their orbits to their respective targets — effectively enabling the MRV to keep moving from satellite to satellite in the geostationary belt.

However the robotic arm itself provides more than just a “grapple-tug” service for the Mission Extention Pods.

“It could actually be used to do other types of services as well” noted Anderson. “Every couple of years there are satellites that the solar array doesn’t deploy properly or antennas don’t deploy properly. And these robotic arms could be used to service those types of anomalies and perhaps restore them to full service.”

The arms themselves come from DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency​).

“We started looking at our own arm developing that or procuring a robotic arm. But ultimately we had a good opportunity to partner with DARPA who’ve been developing very sophisticated space robotics for decades now” said Anderson.

“And the opportunity came to us that they had a couple of robotic arms that they’d been developing that were near flight-ready. And we were able to put together a partnership with them to fly their robotics on our commercial vehicle.”

But… why so long from STS-49 to now in terms of on-orbit repair being a more permanent element of our use of space assets?

“A very short answer is because it’s hard” answered Anderson. “People have talked about this for decades and they’ve tried to create businesses to do this type of work. I think what we did a little bit different is we took a relatively ‘keep it simple’ approach because it is hard.”

“And that ‘keep it simple’ approach was to simply dock to these two features [the liquid apogee engine or the launch adaptor ring]. Prior attempts were all looking at trying to refuel the satellites in orbit that were not designed to be refueled. And that’s really the long pole. That’s a big increment in technology and risk.”

“And so I think this approach that we selected to sort of take incremental steps where the customers can tolerate the risk level and we could develop a real business case is what worked.”

New research has found that the James Webb Space Telescope’s thin sunshields and future inflatable spacecraft may be at risk.

Micrometeoroids on Steroids

A micrometeoroid is a tiny bit of space junk usually weighing less than a gram. Some of them are the leftover bits of the countless collisions that have occurred over the past 4.5 billion years of the history of the solar system. Most however come from the dust cloud that initially collapsed to form our solar system and never got to be a part of a larger body. Because of this they absolutely flood the entire system. Some calculations even estimate that over 10000 tons of micrometeoroids fall onto the Earth every single year.

Thankfully for us surface dwellers the constant barrage of micrometeoroid impacts are no big deal because our atmosphere easily soaks them up. But out in space without the protection of our atmosphere they can be a real pain.

Despite their small size micrometeoroids can pack a real punch. Each one travels several kilometers per second and they are perfectly capable of digging tiny holes into unprotected spacecraft. The current best solution to prevent damage from micrometeoroids is called the Whipple shield in honor of its inventor Fed Whipple. It’s a simple foil sheet covering the spacecraft. When a micrometeoroid strikes the foil sheet it vaporizes before it reaches the main spacecraft body.

Exposure Risk

The Whipple shield is a simple low-cost low-weight solution to the problem of micrometeoroids. But it only works if you don’t need to intentionally expose parts of your craft to space. For example if you’re building a telescope you can’t cover the front of it in foil and expect to get anything useful done.

Normally space-born telescopes are robust enough that they can shrug off micrometeoroid damage. A small nick here or tiny chip there isn’t going to seriously affect the observations. However new research recently appearing in the preprint journal arXiv outlines the risk for future telescopes. The first instrument at risk? The James Webb Space Telescope.

The main mirror of the James Webb consists of segmented panels of beryllium which is a fairly robust material. However the Webb is an infrared telescope and to do its job it must remain cool. To protect the spacecraft from the glare of the Sun’s radiation the Webb employs giant ultra-thin sheets of a specialized material called Kapton. According to the research micrometeoroids will begin to impact the sunshield slowly degrading it over time by punching tiny holes in it. However the sunshield should still be able to perform well over the expected lifetime of the instrument.

The James Webb stretched the limit of current engineering technology to deliver a large telescope into space. Future observatories include many radical proposals. One idea it to inflate giant mirrors that can act as observatories. These could be far larger than the primary mirror of the Webb. These however will face many challenges from micrometeoroids. Each one will be able to punch a hole in the membrane causing a tiny leak. If enough damage accumulates the inflatable telescope will lose its shape.

The researchers concluded that if we want to use inflatable telescopes in the future we must either design solutions to prevent damage from micrometeoroids or understand that the telescopes may not last very long.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS93aGF0LXdhcy10aGUtd29ybGRzLW1vc3QtZXhwZW5zaXZlLXBsYW5lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Was The World's Most Expensive Plane?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS93aGF0LXdhcy10aGUtd29ybGRzLW1vc3QtZXhwZW5zaXZlLXBsYW5lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vZ3JlZWtjaXR5dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvMDgvZXNwaW9uYWdlLWFtZXJpY2FuLXdhcnNoaXAtdm9sb3Mv0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly9ncmVla2NpdHl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8wOC9lc3Bpb25hZ2UtYW1lcmljYW4td2Fyc2hpcC12b2xvcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man Prosecuted With Espionage For Videotaping An American Warship In Volos,"A 52-year-old man from Volos had the serious criminal charge of espionage laid against him for videotaping the American warship ""USS Arlington"" when it arrived at the port of the city to participate in the ""Alexander the Great"" military exercises.

Last Wednesday the 52-year-old flew an unmanned aircraft from the Pefkakia area in Volos and then over and around the American warship and helicopter carrier videotaping and photographing.

However the drone was noticed by the crew and the Port Authority was immediately informed. They located the pilot and arrested him.

The 52-year-old was taken to the Volos Public Prosecutor on Thursday who prosecuted him for espionage on a felony charge was given a deadline by the investigator to prepare his testimony and was released on restrictive terms.

According to his lawyer the accusation of espionage is not substantiated as he was not found in possession of any other photographic material of military content. At the same time making drone recordings is his hobby.

USS Arlington

USS Arlington (LPD-24) a San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock is the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for Arlington Virginia the location of the Pentagon and the crash site of American Airlines Flight 77 during the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001.

Like her sister ships USS New York and Somerset she is named in commemoration of the attacks. Steel taken from the Pentagon after the attacks is displayed aboard in the ship's museum.

Arlington's keel was laid down on 26 May 2008 at Northrop Grumman's Ingalls shipyard in Pascagoula Mississippi. Builder's Trials of the ship started on 21 August 2012. These were completed on 30 August 2012.

She completed Navy acceptance sea trials on 2 November 2012. The US Navy formally accepted the ship on 7 December 2012.

Arlington arrived at her homeport of Naval Station Norfolk Virginia on 22 March 2013 in preparation for commissioning.

Officially she was commissioned on 8 February 2013 but her ceremonial commissioning occurred on 6 April 2013 at Naval Station Norfolk.

Originally scheduled as the third ship of the San Antonio class she was the eighth to be commissioned. Mrs. Joyce Rumsfeld wife of former United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is the ship's sponsor.

USS Arlington with embarked 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit is participating in exercise Alexander the Great 2022 under the command and control of Task Force 61/2.

ATG22 is a bilateral U.S.-Greece (Hellenic) amphibious training event designed to exercise battalion-level command and control and company-level combined arms training in order to increase U.S. and Greek interoperability and demonstrate the trans-Atlantic relationship between U.S. Navy-Marine Corps and Hellenic Armed Forces.

Shares of the cruise operator fell about 5% to $73.87 after Royal Caribbean Group said higher fuel and food costs spurred by inflationary and supply chain-related challenges are expected to weigh on 2022 earnings.

The company said while bookings for Europe sailings improved throughout the first quarter they slowed following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in late February. Cruises in the Baltic are expected to see the biggest impact.

In March Royal Caribbean joined rivals Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCLH.N and Carnival Corp CCL.N in canceling sailings to Russia and said it was removing Russian port city St. Petersburg from its upcoming itineraries.

However global booking volumes in March and April were significantly higher compared to the same period in 2019 with strong demand for North America-based itineraries.

“Recovery is clearly under way…what the shape of that (recovery) curve looks like for the balance of 2022 will depend on the health of the consumer as it relates to inflationary pressures and impacts from the Ukraine war” said M Science analyst Michael Erstad.

The decision by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to remove COVID-19 notice against cruise travel in March almost two years after introducing a warning scale is expected to boost growth for cruise companies after a long period of minimal business.

Royal Caribbean Group’s revenue rose to $1.06 billion in the first quarter from $42.01 million a year earlier but missed analysts’ average estimate of $1.15 billion according to IBES Refinitiv data.

Excluding items it posted a loss of $4.57 per share compared with estimates for a loss of $4.47.

Jeff Farschman

For nearly two decades Jeff Farschman 72 has spent his golden years like many other adventurous retirees — enjoying leisure cruises to exotic ports of call. But unlike many of his fellow cruise passengers Farschman basically lives at sea. He spends months traveling the world's oceans and waterways — half of the year if not more. Although he still keeps a physical home near where he grew up in Delaware Farschman is now part of a growing cohort of older folks who are literally ""retiring"" on cruise ships. ""Pandemic aside I've been cruising for seven to eight months a year"" Farschman said. ""I am a world traveler and explorer type and cruising has literally allowed me to see the entire planet.""

Be sure to manage this risk as you near retirement Living on a ship was not exactly what Farschman had in mind when he first began cruising. But the former vice president at Lockheed Martin found himself stuck on a conventional Caribbean cruise when Hurricane Ivan hit back in 2004. ""I just kept on extending and extending my time on board because the hurricane ruined my original winter plans"" he explained. ""Ultimately I ended up completing six voyages in a row.""

Almost 20 years later Farschman now organizes his life around his time at sea — keeping his periods ashore as brief as possible. That said like every other cruiser ""retirees-at-sea"" found themselves back on dry land during much of the coronavirus pandemic when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shut down all cruises from U.S. ports. For Farschman that meant 19 months — including winter — without cruising his longest period ashore in nearly two decades. But once major lines established clear Covid health protocols serial cruisers were the first back on board. While Covid outbreaks have since been reported — including notable instances in San Francisco and Seattle — folks like Farschman say they feel safe while cruising.

Although there are no hard numbers retiring on a cruise ship is gaining an increasingly higher profile — despite the industry tumult caused by the coronavirus crisis. Serial cruiser and author Lee Wachtstetter for instance wrote a much-read memoir about living on cruise ships for 12 years after her husband died. Farschman meanwhile chronicles his sea-faring ventures on his blog — facilitated by on-board WiFi that's ""become so much more reliable though sadly not necessarily more affordable"" he said. Upgraded connectivity has also allowed semi-retired cruisers to be based at sea while still working. ""The WiFi on most vessels is now strong enough for Zooms"" said Tara Bruce a consultant and creative brand manager at Goodwin Investment Advisory Services a Woodstock Georgia-based financial advisory firm that helps folks retiring at sea.

With cruising you cover all of your living expenses — food housing entertainment — in one place. Tara Bruce creative brand manager at Goodwin Investment Advisory Services

In many ways retiring on a cruise ship makes a lot of sense. Stereotypes aside cruising has always appealed to older travelers. In fact according to the Cruise Lines International Association one-third of the 28.5 million people who took a cruise in 2018 were over 60 years old — and more than 50% were over 50 years old. What's more cruise ships offer many of the essential elements seniors need to thrive: organized activities a decent level of medical care and most crucially a built-in community of like-minded travelers. Retiring on a cruise ship can also prove economically sound.

Cheaper than assisted living

""With cruising you cover all of your living expenses — food housing entertainment — in one place"" said Bruce. Although pricing on luxury liners can inch towards $250 per day ""we've seen folks get costs down to $89 per day which is far cheaper than assisted care or other kinds of senior living."" Repeat cruisers like Farschman are also eligible for on-board credits towards premium meals drinks spas and other activities that can easily reach ""hundreds of dollars per voyage"" Farschman said. The rise of the ""retire-at-sea"" movement has been aided by a recent shift toward longer more elaborate ""world cruises"" or ""grand cruises"" that can last 50 days or more at a time.

Holland America for instance offers a 71-day Grand Africa Voyage itinerary stopping in 25 ports in 21 countries along with a Grand World Voyage visiting 61 ports in 30 countries totaling 127 days at sea. ""They're typically comprised of several segments with extensive times in each port"" explained Colleen McDaniel editor-in-chief of Cruisecritic.com. With careful planning — often bookended by shorter ""connector"" cruises — ""grand"" itineraries can keep cruisers at sea almost indefinitely. Holland America's back-to-back so-called Collectors Voyages not only help retirees avoid repeating port calls they also include discounts of 10% and 15% according to Eric Elvejord Holland America's director of public relations.

A lucrative demographic

Although few cruise lines specifically target retirees — Oceania for its part had a Snowbird in Residence program which has since been canceled — specialty agents are waking up to this lucrative demographic. The Cruise Web Inc. based in Tysons Virginia launched a Senior Living at Sea program that both builds out retiree-specific itineraries and helps clients manage their their lives back on shore.

According to Mike Litterst chief of communications for the National Mall ""The Lincoln Memorial more than any other of the monuments and memorials we oversee has become a historic site in its own right a symbol of where you go to exercise your First Amendment right.""

But Litterst said creating a stage for protest wasn't part of the Memorial's original design: ""It is on a straight line axis from the Capitol to the Washington Monument to where the Lincoln Memorial was built. Henry Bacon the architect envisioned that at the far end of the of the Mall you have the Capitol Building which represents the government and here you have the Lincoln Memorial Abraham Lincoln the savior of that government.""

Arlington Memorial Bridge is a symbolic link connecting the Memorial and the Mall to the formerly Confederate Virginia.

But imagine if the Lincoln Memorial looked like this … or this!

Ultimately It was preeminent American architect Henry Bacon's Neoclassical design that was selected modeled after the Parthenon in Athens all to celebrate a man born in a log cabin.

There are 87 steps to the Memorial – that's right: four-score-and-seven steps leading up to Lincoln and to engravings of his Gettysburg Address and Second Inaugural Address. And those with an eagle eye can even spot a typo!

As Litterst pointed out to correspondent Faith Salie ""The word 'future' was mistakenly carved with an E to start and had to be sort of puttied or filled in to make the E back into an F"" – a charming accident buried in a very deliberate design.

The memorial was symbolically hewn from rock that hailed from all parts of the United States – stone from Massachusetts Colorado Tennessee – while Lincoln himself is carved of Georgia marble. The design scheme was unity so there is almost no mention of the actual cause of the Civil War slavery.

Scott Sandage professor of American history at Carnegie Mellon University notes ""By saying nothing about slavery you avoid the rubbing of old sores. So they intentionally build a memorial that has no references in it to enslavement or to the end of slavery except for the eloquent references that Abraham Lincoln himself made in his Second Inaugural Address."" [""American slavery is one of those offenses which in the providence of God … He now wills to remove.""]

On May 30 1922 the memorial was dedicated by former President Howard Taft in front of a large segregated crowd one that included Lincoln's son Robert Todd Lincoln. The only African-American speaker of the day Dr. Robert Moton head of the Tuskegee Institute even had his speech censored. Only the Civil War Union veterans were seated Black next to white as they had fought on the battlefield.

Sandage said ""Historically Black newspapers like the Chicago Defender began to run editorials that said the Lincoln Memorial has been opened but it has not been dedicated because the memorial itself didn't say anything about slavery.""

Perhaps the memorial's true dedication came in 1939 when African-American superstar contralto Marian Anderson (whom famed conductor Arturo Toscanini called ""the voice of the century"") performed on its steps according to professor Salamishah Tillet of Rutgers Newark: ""I would say when she sang the people think of as the beginning of the modern civil rights movement.""

Anderson had wanted to perform at the capital's largest indoor venue Constitution Hall. But said Tillet ""She was turned down by the Daughters of the American Revolution who said that only white performers are allowed access there.""

Instead she sang on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial for an integrated crowd of 75000 and a radio audience of millions.

When Anderson began to sing ""My Country 'Tis of Thee"" she changed the words: Instead of singing ""O thee I sing"" she sang ""To thee we sing.""

Tillet said ""And she becomes an American voice of democracy in that moment. Performing in front of [Lincoln] was also a way of writing Black people back into the history of Lincoln.""

And turning the steps of the Lincoln Memorial into a stage.

Sandage said ""If you walk up those steps I think it's impossible not to think of Martin Luther King in addition to thinking about Abraham Lincoln; not to think of contralto Marian Anderson. And so in an amazing twist the Lincoln Memorial became a place for rewriting the history that it was intended to erase.

""It was intended to forget about racial divides and it became a place for remembering them and trying to heal them.""

Nvidia fined $5.5M over cryptomining disclosures

The SEC said Friday that Nvidia didn't adequately disclose how cryptocurrency mining impacted its sales of graphics chips. According to an SEC release ""during consecutive quarters in NVIDIA's fiscal year 2018 the company failed to disclose that cryptomining was a significant element of its material revenue growth from the sale of its graphics processing units (GPUs) designed and marketed for gaming.""

As part of the settlement with the SEC Nvidia didn't admit to or deny the findings.

Cryptocurrency mining often relies on higher-end graphics cards like those used for video games which some publications like the BBC PCMag and Tech Radar have reported may be partly responsible for a graphics card shortage.

Bored Ape Yacht Club owned by parent company Yuga Labs is one of the better-known NFT collections. The BAYC brand is expanding into an online video game and on Saturday Yuga Labs released a collection of digital land grant NFTs to be used inside this game. Each NFT land grant sold for a little under $6000.

Like most nonfungible tokens Borred Ape Yacht Club NFTs are built on the ethereum blockchain. Transactions on ethereum come with fees called gas fees. Gas fees increase as growth occurs in the number of people engaging in transactions at any given time. The NFT land grants turned out to be so popular that gas fees skyrocketed and transactions became incredibly expensive. One person paid $44000 in gas fees alone to buy two NFT land plots. In about three hours Yuga Labs made around $320 million and sold 55000 digital land plots.

SEC bolsters crypto enforcement with new personnel

Angela Lang/CNET

The Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday that it's adding 20 new positions to its Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit which protects crypto investors and safeguards against cyberthreats. ""As more investors access the crypto markets it is increasingly important to dedicate more resources to protecting them"" said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. ""By nearly doubling the size of this key unit the SEC will be better equipped to police wrongdoing in the crypto markets while continuing to identify disclosure and controls issues with respect to cybersecurity.""

Wikipedia sunsets cryptocurrency donations

The world's seventh largest website is set to stop accepting cryptocurrency donations. The Wikimedia Foundation which runs Wikipedia voted on the decision last month citing environmental and ethical concerns. ""We began our direct acceptance of cryptocurrency in 2014 based on requests from our volunteers and donor communities"" the foundation said on May 1. ""We are making this decision based on recent feedback from those same communities."" The website plans to close its Bitpay account eliminating its ability to accept crypto donations going forward. The foundation further noted they'd continue to monitor the situation.

Bitcoin the most popular of all cryptocurrencies is an energy hog that is estimated to use as much energy every year as some countries such as Norway and Sweden. And some critics say cryptocurrencies raise ethical questions related to money laundering tax evasion and ransomware among other things.

Video game giant Square Enix the same company that makes the popular Final Fantasy series sold the Tomb Raider franchise to free up cash for investments in fields including blockchain AI and the cloud. Square Enix has previously expressed interest in NFTs. The company's president Yosuke Matsuda said in a Jan. 1 letter that ""the advent of NFTs using blockchain technology significantly increased the liquidity of digital goods enabling the trading of a variety of such goods at high prices and sparking conversations the world over."" In the letter Matsuda also noted that NFT trading seems overheated with ""somewhat speculative overtones.""

NiceHash the company that designed the QuickMiner software and Excavator miner has finally broken Nvidia's algorithm restoring LHR graphics cards to their 100% Ethereum mining performance.



Since LHR's introduction a year ago many have tried to circumvent the anti-mining limiter. Mining software like NBMiner managed to recover up to 70% performance on LHR graphics cards. Meanwhile other programs like T-Rex were more creative and enabled simultaneous mining of two distinct cryptocurrencies to put the remaining 30% to good use. Preying on miners' hopes some shady crew released a supposed LHR Mining Unlocker which turned out to be malware. However the latest QuickMiner release candidate from NiceHash is the real deal and we've tested it.



QuickMiner only supports the DaggerHashimoto (Ethash) algorithm in its current state. The software works fine on Windows but Linux miners will have to wait until NiceHash enables support for the latter. The developer said QuickMiner can unlock almost every Ampere-powered graphics card the key exceptions being the GeForce RTX 3050 and GeForce RTX 3080 12GB which reportedly use a newer LHR algorithm (LHRv3). We confirmed this on the MSI GeForce RTX 3080 12GB Suprim X which still plugs along at around 65 MH/s.

On the other hand our GeForce RTX 3080 Ti Founders Edition quickly broke the 100 MH/s barrier with QuickMiner's LHR unlock. When the limiter previously bound the Ampere-powered graphics card we could only get 77 MH/s out of it. By NiceHash's estimate a GeForce RTX 3080 Ti LHR should get around 120 MH/s; however that's at very aggressive overclocks. Our sample is a Founders Edition and we weren't comfortable pushing the GDDR6X memory to 110 degrees Celsius. Instead we opted for the ""Medium"" optimization in QuickMiner which delivered steady hash rates of around 108–110 MH/s — still at 108 degrees Celsius on the GDDR6X incidentally.

Graphics card pricing has been plummeting and we're starting to see better availability at retailers with some GPUs selling at or below MSRP. So QuickMiner's arrival shouldn't influence the current state of the graphics market unless big corporations want to buy out everything in sight for the last push before Ethereum's transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) often referred to as ""The Merge"" is complete. We see that as unlikely considering current profitability even on a 3080 Ti sits at around $3.50 per day and would still need nearly a year to break even at current rates. Initially scheduled for June The Merge won't finalize until ""the few months after"" as Ethereum developer Tim Beiko has expressed on Twitter.

It will be interesting to see if Nvidia responds to this with updated drivers or implements LHRv3 in the remaining GPUs. However it's perhaps not worth the effort at this point and all existing LHRv2 and earlier cards can just stay on current drivers for optimized mining performance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzk0NTA0LW52aWRpYS1saHItbGltaXRlci1oYXMtYnlwYXNzZWQtZW5hYmxpbmctZnVsbC1taW5pbmcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia's LHR limiter has been bypassed enabling full mining performance,"What just happened? NiceHash's mining software can now bypass the mining limiter Nvidia put on LHR versions of its Ampere lineup restoring the full mining performance to most GPUs. However this might not be as bad as it sounds as Ethereum is expected to soon switch to a Proof-of-Stake algorithm.

Over a year ago Nvidia launched Lite Hash Rate (LHR) versions of most of its RTX 3000 lineup which it designed to significantly reduce the mining performance for Ethereum and other GPU-minable cryptocurrencies.

Since then miners have been trying to bypass this limiter with varying degrees of success. A couple of months ago an unlocker tool was released that claimed to restore the full mining performance but it turned out to be just malware.

Today the developers of NiceHash a company that provides mining software have announced that they completely bypassed Nvidia's limiter and unlocked the full mining performance of LHR cards.

Several outlets have tested the newest QuickMiner release candidate and confirmed that it works. An unlocked RTX 3080 Ti can now readily get over 110 MH/s whereas before it was limited to about 80 MH/s.

However there are a few caveats to it as this method currently only works on Windows machines and supports only the DaggerHashimoto (Ethash) algorithm. It also doesn't work on GeForce RTX 3050 and GeForce RTX 3080 12GB cards as these reportedly feature a new LHR algorithm.

Considering how bad the crypto market has been doing lately (Ethereum's price is currently half of its peak) and the improved availability and price of graphics cards this news will probably not affect the market too much. With most cards you'd need close to a year to break even while Ethereum's transition to the Proof-of-Stake algorithm is expected to happen this year."

What does that money buy?,"Oil and gas companies put thousands of dollars every year into New Mexico’s political campaigns on both sides of the aisle seeking to influence policy to protect continued growth in the industry that represents about a third of the state’s budget.

That amounted to about $1.1 million in political contributions between Oct. 5 2021 and April 4 per a report from New Mexico Ethics Watch leading up to the 2022 Mid-term Election.

The latest chunk of change came in a year when New Mexicans could choose a new governor and the three top candidates in that race were the state’s biggest recipients of oil and gas’ dollars.

Sign up for our newsletter the Daily Briefing to get stories like this one delivered straight to your inbox every morning.

Mark Ronchetti a former weatherman seeking the GOP nomination for governor got the most with $300000 coming to his campaign from oil and gas during the latest six-month reporting period read the report followed by Republican State Rep. Rebecca Dow with $122000.

While Republicans are typically viewed as the party with more support for oil and gas Democrat incumbent Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham was the third-highest recipient of oil and gas money in the state the report read with about $60000.

That means gubernatorial candidates got about $500000 almost half of the $1.1 million provide by oil and gas as the industry sought a seat at the table in the race for New Mexico’s highest-ranking political office.

""The oil and gas industry plays an outsized role in the economic fortunes of New Mexico and we believe citizens need to be aware of the industry's continuing influence upon our public officials” said Ethics Watch Executive Director Kathleen Sabo.

Spokesperson for Lujan Grisham's campaign Kendall Witmer denied that campaign donations from the oil and gas industry impacted the governor's decision making touting Lujan Grisham's record on environmental policy and

""Governor Lujan Grisham’s commitment to New Mexico is evidenced by her tireless work to make New Mexico a leader in economic growth by supporting legacy industries and investing in new ones leading the nation in tackling climate and clean energy technologies and investing resources in local communities"" Witmer said.

""Campaign donations have no effect on policy and to imply otherwise is a disservice to the groundbreaking work made by the Governor local public officials industry leaders and communities.""

Overall about 70 percent of oil and gas contributions went to Republicans per the report compared with 60 percent paid to the party in 2020.

That money came from some of the biggest oil companies in the world records show as they focus on the prolific Permian Basin in the southeast corner of New Mexico amid global supply shortfalls on the heels of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and growing demand as the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to subside.

Chevron led with $71000 in campaign contributions between October 2021 and April 2022 followed Artesia-based Santo Petroleum with $66000.

Occidental Petroleum was third with $60413 in contributions the report read and ExxonMobil was fourth with $60000.

Other top contributions from the oil and gas industry were JR Water Transfer’s $50000 NextEra Energy Resources’ $41500 and $37850 from ConocoPhillips.

Another $36200 came from Devon Energy followed by $35800 from the Trust of John A. Yates founder of Yates Petroleum and Marathon Oil Company with $30000 per the report.

Political Action Committees associated with oil and gas contributed another $51000 to the state’s political campaigns per the report while receiving about $260000 from the industry.

About $135000 of that was donated the report read to the New Mexico House Republican Campaign Committee.

In 2020 Ethics Watch reported New Mexico was the fifth-largest recipient of contributions from the industry.

Oil county Republicans support oil and gas' role in state politics

State Sen. David Gallegos of Eunice along New Mexico’s eastern border to Texas in Lea County of the oil-rich Permian Basin region said the industry deserves the influence it pays for as a major driver of the state’s economy.

“They’re a large donor to the state as a whole. What we do to oil and gas hurts everyone” he said. “I think it’s fair. We determine the fate of their industry or their demise. They’re a major player in the room and they deserve a major seat in the room.”

Gallegos said he was concerned the industry’s backing of Democrat candidates might not get the return he said oil and gas hoped for.

“If you butter both sides of the bread someone’s hands get dirty” he said. “I think they (oil and gas) are trying to put an investment in to protect themselves. I don’t think it’s really worked. On the Republican side we know the value of oil and gas.”

Artesia State Rep. Jim Townsend of Eddy County also in the Permian pointed to economic prosperity and jobs created by oil and gas in New Mexico arguing it's interests should represented as they mirror those of many New Mexicans.

""You’re talking about an industry that provides almost half to the state gross domestic product. It is a significant industry"" Townsend said. ""Oil and gas is a significant employer. The jobs of representatives and employers are to represent their districts.

""We are very fortunate to live in an area that is blessed with bountiful resources. We don’t have anything else that back-fill that.""

Is oil and gas threatened by government policy?

Critics of the industry questioned if the value oil and gas brought into New Mexico’s economy would truly be harmed by recent policy decisions.

More:COVID-19 recovery meant more oil spills in New Mexico study says. What can the State do?

A report authored by New Mexico economist Kelly O’Donnell analyzed the impact recently proposed reforms on federal oil and gas policy would have on the state’ revenue.

When he took office in 2019 the administration of President Joe Biden placed a moratorium on new federal oil and gas leases nationwide as the Department of the Interior conducted a review of its fossil fuel programs.

In the years since the DOI implemented policy shifts to account more for environmental and climate change impacts of extraction on public land.

More:Oil and gas flowing from Permian Basin on heels of COVID-19 Russia-Ukraine conflict

About half of New Mexico’s oil and gas operations occur on federal land and industry leaders were widely critical of the federal policy as threatening the state’s economy and its role in the nation’s energy security.

But O’Donnell in the report argued such policy shifts would have no bearing on oil and gas prices which drive production and revenue to the state.

Most of the provisions only apply to new leases the report read and 90 percent of New Mexico’s federal leases or already in production meaning any changes were unlikely to impact present operations.

An increase of federal royalties companies pay on their operations from 12.5 percent to 16.67 percent O’Donnell said would also only apply to new leases and have a “negligible” effect on production costs.

“Congress and the Department of Interior are weighing a variety of reforms that could impact operators on federal land in New Mexico however my analysis shows these impacts would be minimal to state revenue” O’Donnell said.

“Despite claims by the industry and its allies these reforms will have no impact on gas prices and pose little threat to oil and gas production in New Mexico which is expected to continue rising in the coming decade.”

Old Dominion University held its 136th Commencement Exercises May 6 and 7 in Chartway Arena at the Ted Constant Convocation Center. Over the two days nearly 3000 students were awarded bachelor's master's and doctoral degrees during four ceremonies each featuring its own speaker including award-winning actress Angela Bassett.

At each ceremony Provost Austin Agho recognized the 754 distance-learning graduates earning 423 bachelor's degrees 269 master's degrees and 62 doctoral degrees.

Bassett who was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (honoris causa) told graduates of the College of Arts & Letters during the first ceremony on Friday afternoon that they have earned degrees from ""an institution where young women and men have been nurtured and prepared to become strong and resilient leaders.""

She urged graduates to embrace leadership and the challenges it can bring.

""When I speak to graduates I often compare the road to leadership and legacy to learning to walk in your own shoes rather than trying to fill someone else's"" Bassett said. ""And I say this because when we buy a new pair it takes some time for those shoes to feel like they're truly ours. By this I want you to be comfortable with being uncomfortable as you enter into this new chapter. I want you to be mindful as you navigate life outside of ODU. I want you to be thoughtful with making decisions about these next steps on your journey.""

She encouraged them to be unafraid about taking risks.

""As you go out into the world today as graduates always remember this: The great poet Nikki Giovanni once said: 'I really don't think life is about the I-could-have-beens. Life is only about the I-tried-to-do. I don't mind the failure. But I can't imagine that I'd forgive myself if I didn't try.'""

She said she believes the graduates are ""designed for greatness.""

""Monarchs you didn't come this far to come this far"" she said. ""You came this far to excel. You came this far to soar to heights that you your parents your grandparents your ancestors sacrificed and prayed for you to reach.""

""Oh when the world tells you no and they will you'll remember that no is not a passport to failure but it's a gateway to infinite possibilities that you haven't considered or thought of yet. When the world says you're not good enough remember that you have been nurtured for success within an academic university of a long line of alums who have contributed to changing the world. Carry this. Carry this with you every day as a reminder to endure to work hard to push forward and to claim your place at the table of purpose and prosperity. Even in the face of life's certain uncertainty and adversity.""

Advanced Degree Ceremony

Sachin Shetty executive director of the Center for Secure and Intelligent Critical Systems at ODU's Virginia Modeling Analysis and Simulation Center who conducts research that lies at the intersection of computer networking network security and machine learning told masters and Ph.D. graduates that he ""stumbled upon this area by happenstance.""

""I was initially interested in doing research on the Cloud"" said Shetty who earned his Ph.D. from ODU and has worked at the University for six years. ""And during one of my experiments I noticed that when I was accessing the photos that I had uploaded on the Cloud they would move to a different location when I checked them the next day.""

That led him on a path of finding ways to protect information and ""empowering users with the knowledge they need to safeguard their information.""

He relayed to the graduates three takeaways he gained from his experience: to be curious in a constant learning mode and adaptive.

For example he said he has worked on security and privacy problems across wide-ranging occupations including attorneys economists sociologists philosophers psychologists and even dance instructors.

""They have helped me look at problems I saw from diverse perspectives and have also opened up new areas of exploration"" he said. ""These experiences have changed my perception of cybersecurity from a tech-centric problem to a human problem.""

If you can keep this mindset ""Amazing things will happen. I have found that to be true in my career.""

Shetty feels ODU is an excellent place to gain those problem-solving skills especially considering how the University has evolved over the past two decades.

""I'm proud to have graduated from this University"" he said. ""Watching it grow since 2002 when I first stepped foot on this campus has just grown the pride I have of being a Monarch immensely.""

Strome College of Business and Darden College of Education and Professional Studies Undergraduate Ceremony

ODU President Brian O. Hemphill Ph.D. congratulated graduates of the Strome College of Business and Darden College of Education and Professional Studies.

""Please know that like everyone here today I am immensely proud of you and know you are ready for the challenges ahead"" he told the graduates.

""The great discoveries to be made will be made by you. The foundation for a better society begins with you.""

""You are now graduates of one of the finest universities in the country"" he said. ""Your degree from Old Dominion will take you far — as far as you want to go.""

Frank Batten College of Engineering and Technology the College of Health Sciences College of Sciences and School of Cybersecurity Ceremony

Howard Kern president and chief executive officer of Sentara Healthcare shared his 42-year journey from ""the absolute bottom rung as a management fellow"" to the leader of the 134-year-old health care system serving Virginia and North Carolina.

""To achieve great things you need to start with a vision or dream of what you want to achieve. You need aspirations that guide you on your path"" Kern said. ""I set my goals high. I wasn't really sure if I could achieve this but if I had set my sights lower I would not have worked to attain what I have achieved.""

He offered some advice to graduates to improve their odds of success: be clear about personal values and ethics; demonstrate leadership grounded in those values; commit to hard work; and be willing to take risks.

""By risking I am not suggesting big gambles or bets or big losses. I am suggesting that you be bold"" Kern said.

Kern who received a Doctor of Humane Letters (honoris causa) degree during the ceremony finished by encouraging graduates to commit to continuous learning.

""As Mark Twain once said 'I never let schooling interfere with my education.' Make your education and learning a lifelong experience.""

On Friday the American Horror Story actress 63 announced she had received an honorary doctorate from Old Dominion University in Virginia.

Bassett shared that she was ""happy and humbled"" to receive her Doctor of Humane Letters from the esteemed public institution. ""Education is truly the KEY! #stillmakingmymommaproud"" she wrote in her Twitter caption.

Bassett received the honor the same weekend she served as a keynote speaker for ODU's 2022 commencement ceremony. Addressing the graduating class Bassett powerfully urged students to honor the values of royalty set forth by ODU's mascot the Monarch a lion with a crown on its head.

""Thanks to a little film called Black Panther I think I know a little bit about royalty … well fictional royalty at least"" Bassett joked drawing a laugh from the crowd.

But the actress was quick to emphasize the royalty she spoke about had nothing to do with ""superheroes or kingdoms or magical powers"" and everything to do with the graduates in front of her.

""It's about your leadership and your legacy"" Bassett passionately shared. ""That's the real crown that I want you to wear every day when you step out into the world.""

The 9-1-1 star already possessed an honorary doctorate from Morehouse College a historically Black college in Atlanta that honored Bassett for her leadership in Hollywood. She also has three degrees including an honorary doctorate from her alma mater Yale University.

In 2020 Yale presented her with its lifetime achievement award making Bassett the first Black recipient of the honor. Previous recipients of the award include Yale alumni President George H.W.

Bush Jodie Foster and Anderson Cooper.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kdWtlY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjIvMDUvZHVrZS13b21lbnMtdGVubmlzLW5jYWEtdG91cm5hbWVudC1xdWlubmlwaWFjLW9sZC1kb21pbmlvbi1qYW1pZS1hc2h3b3J0aC1lbW1hLWphY2tzb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Duke women's tennis advances to NCAA tournament's super regionals with win against Old Dominion,"Duke advanced past the first weekend of the NCAA tournament with wins against Quinnipiac and Old Dominion.

With home-court advantage and the Duke faithful to cheer them on the Blue Devils played their usual game.

No. 3-seed Duke hosted the first two rounds of the NCAA Tournament at Sheffield Indoor Tennis Center Friday and Saturday where it delivered losses to Quinnipiac and Old Dominion respectively. Starting by handling the Bobcats with a 4-0 victory—in which Duke won every set—the Blue Devils had no problem continuing their success Saturday against the Monarchs who had shut out Furman 5-0 one day earlier to compete against the Blue Devils.

And with a 4-1 triumph to punch their ticket to the tournament's super regionals the Blue Devils showed that they have everything they need to keep their season on fire.

“We have full trust and belief in each other and full trust and belief in ourselves” head coach Jamie Ashworth said. “No matter what the situation is we feel that we can compete our way out of situations that we put ourselves into.”

Heading into the NCAA tournament as the ACC champion and the No. 4 team in the nation Duke had the upper hand. Even as Old Dominion began catching its breath with star player Yuliia Starodubtseva’s victory in singles against junior Chloe Beck the Blue Devils retained the upper hand with a fierce performance by freshman Emma Jackson who gave Duke its fourth and final point of the day.

With the last time she had played in a match being her title-clinching victory at the ACC tournament Jackson came into Saturday ready to play. After tallying a victory in her first set and with Duke leading 3-1 the La Grange Park Ill. native played precisely how she needed to in order to get ahead.

At first it looked as if Old Dominion could potentially catch up to the Blue Devils as Tatsiana Sasnouskaya won the second set on court two against Duke's Georgia Drummy who had won the first. However Jackson was quick with the ball and despite opponent Marina Alcaide tying her 2-2 in the second set the freshman star pulled away to win 6-2 6-3 to etch Duke’s name onto the bracket for another round.

“Emma plays free and swings freely. She can really dictate especially with her groundstrokes. And so she just needed to kind of open up and swing like she’s capable of swinging and have that belief” Ashworth said about how Jackson pulled away in the second set. “I think that was our whole team mentality. I don’t think she has any different mentality than anybody else. And I think that when they trust themselves and believe in themselves they’re a really good team.”

Though Jackson was the player to close out the match the contest was a textbook team victory with action from every Blue Devil who saw the court helping them to reach four points. Duke started the afternoon off with a strong doubles performance on court two from Beck and freshman Ellie Coleman. They took down the duo of Alesya Yakubovich and Shahar Biran in a quick 6-1 set. But court one was a different story as Starodubtseva and Sasnouskaya struck back against the Blue Devils by taking down the duo of Drummy and Karolina Berankova 6-3. With no lead yet for either team the doubles point came down to court three. Old Dominion’s Alexandra Viktorovich and Sofia Johnson held tight to Duke throughout but the Blue Devils' Margaryta Bilokin and Eliza Omirou took the set 7-5. With the doubles point in tow Duke started with the same level of energy in singles. Bilokin did not appear tired from her intense doubles match as she took court five and defeated Yakubovich 6-0 6-0. Senior Kelly Chen quickly followed taking down Johnson 6-1 6-1.

“When [Bilokin] swings and doesn't play with any kind of hesitation she can have matches like she did today—and she kept it going there for the whole two sets” Ashworth said. “Kelly's been playing really well the last couple of weeks. And I think that she's relaxed. She's always been such a big player for us the last couple of years and this time of year she has that experience and it’s great to see and it's great for them both to be vocal on the court. It was a good lift for us after the close double match.”

The Blue Devils will next host either Georgia or Wake Forest depending on which team wins in its second-round matchup for a quarterfinal berth Friday.

“We're looking forward to [playing at home] on Friday whoever it may be—both are really good teams” Ashworth said. “We’ve been fortunate enough to have played Wake Forest twice this year and haven't played Georgia in a couple of years. But they both fight and they both compete and no matter who it is it will be a good match and we'll be ready to have a good one.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJldC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9hcG1qZG0vYW5nZWxhLWJhc3NldHQtaGFwcHktaHVtYmxlZC1ob25vcmFyeS1kb2N0b3JhdGUtb2R10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Angela Bassett 'Happy And Humbled' By Honorary Doctorate From Old Dominion University,"Graduation season is upon us and actress Angela Bassett had a busy weekend at Old Dominion University in Virginia.

According to PEOPLE Bassett announced on Friday (May 6) that she received an honorary doctorate from ODU. She shared her excitement on Instagram.

“I’m so happy and humbled to receive an honorary doctorate” she wrote in an Instagram caption. “Education is truly KEY! #stillmakingmommaproud.”

On May 6 the Black Panther actress also delivered her keynote speech to the ODU class of 2022.

“Throughout your time at ODU many of you have proudly looked at the monarch —a royal crown on a lion’s head — as a salute to your school’s rich history strength pride fearlessness royalty” she said.

“And thanks to a little film called Black Panther I think I know a little bit about royalty … well fictional royalty at least"" she said earning laughs from the attendees.

Bassett 63 has been bestowed the honorary doctorate before. In December 2020 she received a doctorate from Morehouse College a historically Black college in Atlanta. They honored her for her leadership in Hollywood.

Not to mention Bassett received an honorary doctorate from her alma mater Yale University in 2018. In 2020 she was honored with Yale Undergraduate Lifetime Achievement Award (YULAA).

She earned her Bachelor of Arts in African American studies in 1980 from Yale and a Master of Fine Arts at Yale’s School of Drama in 1983."

Light-matter interactions in semiconductors can be precisely controlled by tuning the coupling between excitons bosonic quasi-particles made of bound electron-hole pairs and photons confined in an optical resonator. At high coupling strengths resonant photons coherently exchange energy with excitons at a rate (Rabi frequency Ω R ) higher than that of the dephasing processes (i.e. the rate at which photons escape from the cavity or excitons dephase) entering the so-called strong coupling (SC) regime. From this process new hybrid quantum states are formed called polaritons. Reaching the SC regime opened new avenues for observing highly nonlinear optical phenomena in the solid state such as Bose-Einstein condensation12 polariton lasing34 and optical parametric amplification5. These discoveries have been recently exploited for the creation of all-optical logic gates6 and polariton-based neural networks7.

Among the different types of semiconductors systems monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) stand out as a highly promising platform for exploring the nonlinear effects produced in the SC regime. Charge carriers in such materials experience an out-of-plane quantum confinement generated by their intrinsic 2D structure which together with the reduced Coulomb screening leads to excitons with huge binding energies (several hundreds of meV) and prominent oscillator strengths persisting up to room temperature89. Moreover the broken spatial inversion symmetry of the 2D lattice together with a large spin-orbit coupling provides an uncommon pseudo-spin degree of freedom for excitons in the K and K′ valleys of the Brillouin zone. Valley excitons thus become selectively addressable by exciting them with oppositely circularly polarized light10 whose valley coherence can be even enhanced by the strong coupling with long-living cavity photons11. Excitons in TMDs uniquely combine high temperature stability with large nonlinearities which makes them an ideal solution for room-temperature polaritonics.

In order to reach the SC regime TMD monolayers can be coupled to different optical resonators. Seminal studies of TMD polaritons exploited atomically thin flakes embedded in vertical microcavities (Fig. 1a). Such devices consist of two highly reflective planar or concave mirrors facing each other and distanced hundreds of nanometers confining photons at discrete energy levels the “cavity modes” whose frequencies are determined by the distance between the mirrors. The cavity mirrors can be made of metallic films or of Distributed Bragg Reflector (DBR) a sequence of pairs of dielectric layers with high/low refractive index. In such devices SC was demonstrated for neutral excitons1213 trions1415 and excited Rydberg excitons16 using monolayers either mechanically exfoliated or grown by chemical vapor deposition on a large scale17. TMD polaritons have been also observed in planar architectures towards on-chip optical circuits exploiting the sub-diffraction spatial light confinement of plasmonic nanoresonators (Fig. 1b)1819 or involving propagating modes as for waveguides20 Bloch Surface Waves (BSW)21 surface lattice resonances2223 photonic crystal slabs (1D gratings)24 (Fig. 1c) and Bound states In the Continuum (BIC)25.

Studies of polariton nonlinearities are of key importance for the understanding of the nonlinear optical processes which form the basis of coherent emission for ultrafast optical switches and for optical parametric scattering the latter being observed very recently in a TMD vertical cavity26. However investigations of such effects on the ultrafast timescale and in deep-subwavelength optical structures have been very limited so far.

Tang et al.18 explore the ultrafast dynamics of the nonlinear optical response for WS 2 monolayers strongly coupled to plasmonic silver nanodisks unveiling a giant nonlinearity and studying the underlying physical processes. The non-equilibrium dynamics of the samples were analysed by using femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy revealing different exciton-plasmon nonlinear processes over distinct timescales. The main mechanisms which govern the optical nonlinearity in TMD-based microcavity polariton devices27 are identified as (i) the repulsive Coulombic interaction between excitons which usually reflects in a blueshift of the resonance energy and (ii) phase space filling (or Pauli blocking) inducing excitonic saturation and reducing the exciton-photon coupling strength. In addition excitation-induced dephasing in TMDs has been recently found to play a non-negligible role at high fluences28 typically giving rise to a broadening of excitonic linewidths. The prominent role of the latter mechanism was demonstrated in this work studying the nonlinear behaviour of plasmon-exciton polaritons (also known as plexcitons) as a function of the excitation fluence. Very interestingly the authors show a direct application of the strong nonlinear interactions that they found exploiting the flexibility of the system to easily modify the light-matter coupling strength. This resulted in the observation of direct and reverse absorption saturation at ultrafast timescales which showcase the potential of TMD polaritons for future uses in sub-wavelength nonlinear optical devices.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMi0xMTQ0OS010gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Filtering electrons by mode coupling in finite semiconductor superlattices | Scientific Reports,"Transfer matrix method for electron transmission

Electrons (similar for holes) in a uniform conductor might be transmitted without any collision when the travel distance is shorter than the mean free path. The electron wavefunction \(\psi \left(x\right)\) in a one-dimensional (1D) conductor as sketched in Fig. 1a can be described by the stationary Schrödinger equation under the effective mass approximation25: \(\left[-\frac{{\hslash }^{2}}{2}\frac{d}{dx}\frac{1}{{m}^{*}\left(x\right)}\frac{d}{dx}+V\left(x\right)\right]\psi \left(x\right)=E\psi \left(x\right)\) where \(\hslash\) is the reduced Planck constant \(E\) is the electron energy and \({m}^{*}\) and \(V\) are the effective mass of electron and potential respectively. The solution is the forward traveling wave \(A{e}^{ikx}\) or the backward traveling one \(B{e}^{-ikx}\) due to the absence of reflection where the wavevector is \(k=\sqrt{2{m}^{*}\left(x\right)\times \left[E-V\left(x\right)\right]}/\hslash\).

(b) Electron transmission through a single-barrier with the barrier height \(V\) and barrier width \({d}_{b}\) the electronic wave at energy of \({E}_{n}^{*}\) denotes the \(n\)th resonant mode whose PS is \(n\pi\). (c) The transmission spectrum and PS of the InP single-barrier when \({d}_{b}=2.5\) nm peaks at \({E}_{1}^{*}\) and \({E}_{2}^{*}\) correspond to the resonant modes. (d) The transmission probability of the InP/InAs/InP double-barrier with different widths. Inset is the potential profile of the asymmetric double-barrier structure. Full size image

The reflection should be considered in a 1D superlattice or other nonuniform conductors. For the uniform or approximately uniform segment inside nonuniform conductors the wavefunction can be expressed as \({\psi }_{j}\left(x\right)={A}_{j}{e}^{i{k}_{j}x}+{B}_{j}{e}^{-i{k}_{j}x}\) at the \(j\)th uniform segment (width \({d}_{j}\)). Combined with the continuity conditions of wavefunction \(\psi \left(x\right)\) and the probability current density of electron \(\frac{1}{{m}_{j}^{*}}\frac{d\psi \left(x\right)}{dx}\) the wave travelling through the \(j\)th uniform segment and into the \(\left(j+1\right)\)th uniform segment can be described by matrices of16

$${P}_{j}=\left(\begin{array}{ll}{e}^{-i{k}_{j}{d}_{j}}& 0\\ 0& {e}^{i{k}_{j}{d}_{j}}\end{array}\right)$$ (1a)

$${T}_{jj+1}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\begin{array}{cc}1+\frac{{k}_{j+1}{m}_{j}^{*}}{{k}_{j}{m}_{j+1}^{*}}& 1-\frac{{k}_{j+1}{m}_{j}^{*}}{{k}_{j}{m}_{j+1}^{*}}\\ 1-\frac{{k}_{j+1}{m}_{j}^{*}}{{k}_{j}{m}_{j+1}^{*}}& 1+\frac{{k}_{j+1}{m}_{j}^{*}}{{k}_{j}{m}_{j+1}^{*}}\end{array}\right)$$ (1b)

\(M=\cdots {T}_{j-1j} \cdot {P}_{j} \cdot {T}_{jj+1}{P}_{j+1}\cdots\). The transmission probability is calculated by \({\mathcal{T}}_{1N}=\frac{{k}_{N}{m}_{1}^{*}}{{k}_{1}{m}_{N}^{*}}{\left|\frac{1}{{M}_{11}}\right|}^{2}\) and the total phase shift (PS) \(\varphi\) equals the phase of 1/\({M}_{11}\) where the \({k}_{1/N}\) and \({m}_{1/N}^{*}\) are related parameters of outmost segments. For some simplified potential structures e.g. Kronig-Penney superlattice electrons with certain energies can be 100% transmitted and the PS satisfies the FP resonance condition26:

$$\varphi =z\pi \left(z=\mathrm{12}3\ldots \right)$$ (2)

Resonances at such metastable states are produced by coherent interference.

We next choose the 1D InP/InAs semiconductor heterostructures for further calculations with the parameters of \({m}_{\mathrm{InAs}}^{*}=0.023{m}_{0}\) \({m}_{\mathrm{InP}}^{*}=0.08{m}_{0}\)27 and the barrier height of \(0.57\) eV28 where \({m}_{0}\) is the electron mass in vacuum. InP/InAs heterostructures have been epitaxially grown and embedded in InAs nanowires with the interface abruptness on the level of monolayers282930. For convenience the parameters of InAs and InP are distinguished with subscripts of “\(w\)” and “\(b\)” respectively in the following. Owing to the tunability of Fermi level potentials of two different materials are considered as \({V}_{w}=0\) eV and \({V}_{b}=0.57\) eV. Generally FP resonances can be easily generated in a finite uniform region. For the InP single-barrier embedded in InAs nanowire the matrix element \({M}_{11}={\text{cos}}\left({k}_{b}{d}_{b}\right)-i\left({k}_{w}{m}_{b}/{k}_{b}{m}_{w}+{k}_{b}{m}_{w}/{k}_{w}{m}_{b}\right){\text{sin}}\left({k}_{b}{d}_{b}\right)/2\) and one can get an analytical expression of the transmission probability \(\mathcal{T}=1/[1+{\left({k}_{w}{m}_{b}/{k}_{b}{m}_{w}-{k}_{b}{m}_{w}/{k}_{w}{m}_{b}\right)}^{2}{\text{sin}}^{2}\left({k}_{b}{d}_{b}\right)/4]\). Some perfectly coherent resonances at \(\mathcal{T}=1\) can be found with the energy levels \({E}_{n=\mathrm{12}3\cdots }^{*}\). Based on the FP resonance condition PSs at the metastable states satisfy \({k}_{b}\left({E}_{n}^{*}\right)\cdot {d}_{b}=n\pi\) indicating \({k}_{b}\left({E}_{n}^{*}\right)\) is a real wavevector and \({E}_{n}^{*}>{V}_{b}\) as sketched in Fig. 1b. When \({d}_{b}=2.5\) nm the transmission spectrum and the corresponding PS have been calculated by transfer matrix technique and shown in Fig. 1c. Two peaks appear in the region of \(E<5\) eV and PSs are \(\pi\) and \(2\pi\) respectively confirming the energy values of two peaks are definitely \({E}_{1}^{*}\) and \({E}_{2}^{*}\).

Resonant modes classification

Besides the single-barrier similar resonant transmission can also happen in multiple-barrier structures. If \({d}_{\mathrm{I}}\) is one common divisor length of all barrier widths (\({d}_{1}{d}_{2}{d}_{3}\ldots\)) of the structure the metastable states at energy \({E}_{n}^{*}\) in the single-barrier with width \({d}_{\mathrm{I}}\) will also appear in the multiple-barrier structure because of the severalfold \(\pi\) PS inside all barriers. The transmission spectrum of InP/InAs/InP double-barrier has been calculated after fixing the first barrier width (i.e. \({d}_{1}=2.5\) nm). The second barrier width \({d}_{2}\) and the well width \({d}_{w}\) impact the transmission significantly and more different resonances can be seen in Fig. 1d. However resonances arising in the single-barrier with width \({d}_{1}=2.5\) nm is robust even at the double-barrier structure when the second barrier width is several times of \({d}_{1}\) no matter what the well width is chosen as shown the unity peaks at \({E}_{1}^{*}\) and \({E}_{2}^{*}\). For convenience this kind of modes originated from barriers are called bulk modes in the following.

The enlargement of Fig. 1d shows no other unity peak and the minimum PS of all peaks is more than \(3\pi\) for \({d}_{2}=5\) nm and more than \(5\pi\) for \({d}_{2}=10\) nm. Similar results can be recovered in other asymmetric multiple-barrier structures. The FP resonance condition is invalid even for the perfectly coherent resonances at the asymmetric structure. To uncover the reason the simplified symmetric situation is investigated i.e. \({d}_{1}={d}_{2}\). The widths of each InP barrier and InAs well are chosen as \({d}_{b}=2.5\) nm and \({d}_{w}=5\) nm in the following unless otherwise stated. Figure 2a displays the transmission spectrum of the symmetric double-barrier structure when \(E<5\) eV. Different from the asymmetric structure all peaks are unity in the transmission spectrum. Each passband contains one or two peaks implying modes coupling in the transmission. Different peaks are easily used to distinguish those modes. After compared with Fig. 1 peaks in the two-peak passbands are identified as the resonant modes of 2.5 nm single-barrier as labeled \({E}_{1}^{*}\) and \({E}_{2}^{*}\) in Fig. 2a. Other peaks at \({E}_{n=\mathrm{12}\mathrm{34}5}\) should be determined by the whole potential structure. However calculated results in Fig. 2b show the PS \(\varphi\) deviates the resonance condition at \({E}_{n=\mathrm{12}\mathrm{34}5}\). Inspired from the uniform conductor whose crystal lattice is periodic at the atomic scale the symmetric double-barrier here can also be reconfigured to a periodic structure after adding an extra well at one side as shown in the dashed box in the Inset of Fig. 2a. So far the symmetric InP/InAs/InP double-barrier structure can be regarded as 2-period superlattice with the unit cell of InP/InAs. Then the PS at \({E}_{n=\mathrm{12}\mathrm{34}5}\) is \(\left(2n-1\right)\pi\) as shown in Fig. 2b.

The electronic bands of the infinite superlattice can be calculated with the Bloch theorem

$${M}_{u}\psi ={e}^{i\kappa a}\psi$$ (3)

\({M}_{u}\) is the transfer matrix of the unit cell \(a\) is the lattice constant and \(\kappa\) is the Bloch wavevector. The simplification of Eq. (3) for InP/InAs superlattice is \({\text{cos}}\left(\kappa a\right)={\text{cos}}\left({k}_{b}b\right){\text{cos}}\left({k}_{w}w\right)-\left({k}_{w}{m}_{b}/{k}_{b}{m}_{w}+{k}_{b}{m}_{w}/{k}_{w}{m}_{b}\right){\text{sin}}\left({k}_{b}b\right){\text{sin}}\left({k}_{w}w\right)/2\). Figure 2c shows the band structure where allowed bands are consistent with the transmission spectrum. Notice that not all states at each miniband are perfect resonances for finite superlattice. The FP resonance condition enable the determination of those discrete metastable states of perfect resonances. It is known that the Bloch wavevector \(\kappa\) can be regarded as an effective vector in a periodic conductor so that the PS of the discrete state in the \(N\)-period superlattice is expressed as \(\varphi =N\kappa a\). At the \(m\)th Brillouin zone [i.e. \(\left(m-1\right)\pi /a<\kappa <m\pi /a\)] the value of \(\kappa =\left(m-1+n/N\right)\pi /a\) holds the resonance condition3132333435 where \(n=\mathrm{12}3\cdots N-1\) is the resonance index in \(m\)th Brillouin zone namely there are \(N-1\) resonances in each Brillouin zone. For our 2-period InP/InAs superlattice the intersection points of \(\kappa =\pi /2a\) and the dispersion curves in Fig. 2c correspond with the resonance energy levels of \({E}_{n=\mathrm{12}\mathrm{34}5}\). These modes originated from the periodicity can be called as Bloch modes36.

The added well for reconfigured periodic structure has no impact on the transmission due to the same value of \({\left|{M}_{11}\right|}^{2}\) and \({\left|{M}_{11}{e}^{\pm i{k}_{w}{d}_{w}}\right|}^{2}\). Combined with the finite element method the wavefunction \(\psi\) can be solved with respect to \(x\). For the 2-period InP/InAs superlattice \({\left|\psi \right|}^{2}\) of two different resonant modes at \({E}_{1}\) and \({E}_{1}^{*}\) are shown in Fig. 2d. \({\left|\psi \right|}^{2}\) is distributed in barriers for \({E}_{1}^{*}\) and in the symmetric double-barrier structure for \({E}_{1}\) confirming the PS complement effect of the added well. Transmission modes related to \({E}_{n=\mathrm{12}\mathrm{34}5}\) in the symmetric structure are similar with those bulk modes in single-barrier except the counting way of PS. This deduction can be confirmed by two symmetric double-barrier structures connected with an extra InAs well (width \({d}_{w}^{^{\prime}}\)). The transmission spectra of this structure are shown in Fig. 2e when \({d}_{w}^{^{\prime}}=1\) nm and \({d}_{w}^{^{\prime}}=5\) nm where the robust resonant modes of one double-barrier still appear in the transmission spectra. For convenience this kind of modes are called symmetric modes in the following and are equivalent to the Bloch modes if the structure becomes periodic after considering the added well.

The band structure of the InP/InAs superlattice is obtained by \({\text{Det}}\left({P}_{b}{T}_{bw}{P}_{w}{T}_{wb}-{e}^{i\kappa a}\right)=0\) which can be transferred to \({\text{Det}}\left({P}_{b2}{T}_{bw}{P}_{w}{T}_{wb}{P}_{b1}-{e}^{i\kappa a}\right)=0\) if \({d}_{b1}+{d}_{b2}+{d}_{w}=a\). In other words the unit cell of the periodic superlattice can be arbitrarily chosen with the invariable band structure as sketched by the dashed boxes in Fig. 3a. Figure 3c shows the band structure of the InP/InAs infinite superlattice with the InP barrier width of 5 nm. The choice of unit cell significantly impacts the transmission of the superlattice with the finite periodicity \(N\). Figure 3df show the transmission spectrum of superlattice with the unit cell of InP/InAs structure when \(N=10\). It is found that nine or ten unity peaks in each Brillouin zone. Based on the analysis of Fig. 2 nine unity peaks come from Bloch (or symmetric here) resonant modes and the extra one peak (in accord with resonances of a 5 nm barrier) in some Brillouin zones is the bulk resonant mode. For the unit cell of the asymmetric InP/InAs/InP structure (i.e. \({d}_{b1}

e {d}_{b2}\)) nine Bloch resonant modes reappear in each Brillouin zone (not shown here). For the unit cell of symmetric InP/InAs/InP structure (i.e. \({d}_{b1}={d}_{b2}\)) some more interesting unity peaks arise. The main cause here is that the symmetric unit cell itself can also be regarded as the 2-period local superlattice with a local InP/InAs unit cell (for comparison the symmetric InP/InAs/InP structure is the unit cell of the global superlattice). The band structure of the local superlattice with infinite periodicity is shown in Fig. 3c. The transmission spectrum when \(N=10\) is shown in Fig. 3eg implying that the band structure of the global superlattice determines allowed or forbidden bands. Therefore energy levels of \({E}_{n=\mathrm{12}\mathrm{34}5}\) at \(\kappa =\pi /2a\) from dispersion curves of the local superlattice are the resonance energies only if they are located inside the allowed bands. Besides Bloch resonances of global superlattice one extra Bloch resonance (as remarked by green circles in Fig. 3) is in 1st 2nd 4th 6th and 7th Brillouin zone when \(E<5\) eV. In addition one more bulk resonance is found in 4th and 7th Brillouin zone (as remarked by red stars in Figs. 2 and 3). Consequently the transmission spectrum of the \(N\)-period superlattice with the unit cell of symmetric InP/InAs/InP structure is related to the coupling between Bloch modes symmetric modes and bulk modes.

Transmission by mode coupling

The coupling of multiple modes significantly improves the electron transmission in allowed bands. Theoretically there are \(N-1\) unity transmission peaks in each Brillouin zone ascribed to Bloch modes because of the wave interference as well as \(N-2\) deeps with transmission probability \(\mathcal{T}=0\) between neighboring peaks. However zero deeps are never reached due to the modes coupling. As shown in Fig. 3fg deeps are improved to the orders of ~ 10–4 and ~ 100 in the first Brillouin zone (i.e. the tunneling region here) for two different superlattices which are close to the transmission probabilities of the unit cell itself especially around the symmetric resonances. The empirical explanation of the improvement might be the independent transmission of three different modes during coupling. At the first Brillouin zone the coupling of Bloch modes and symmetric modes dominates the transmission due to the perfectly coherent resonance. By carefully choosing barrier and well widths the perfectly coherent resonance energies of the local modes (\({E}_{n=\mathrm{12}3\cdots }^{*}\) and \({E}_{n=\mathrm{12}3\cdots }\)) can be tuned to the middle of the allowed band and the probabilities in arbitrary Brillouin zone can then be improved to a high level finally forming the band-pass transmission.

It is found that symmetric resonances always arise in the allowed bands of the tunneling region (where \(E<V\)) which can be ascribed to the shared wells of global and local superlattices. For \(E>V\) barriers of unit cells become important roles in PS accumulation because of the real wavevector resulting in different overlap of bands as shown in Fig. 3c. To confirm and extend the deduction 3-period superlattice with the unit cell of symmetric InP/InAs/InP/InAs/InP triple-barrier is studied by the same method. The band structures of global and local superlattices with infinite periodicity are shown in Fig. 4a where two allowed minibands appear in the tunneling region. Based on the bands of local superlattice the perfectly coherent resonances take place at \(\kappa =\pi /3a\) and \(\kappa =2\pi /3a\) for finite periodicity which are indeed located inside the 1st and 2nd allowed minibands as labeled \({E}_{1}\) and \({E}_{2}\) in Fig. 4a. Deeps in the transmission spectrum are improved to the level of 100 as shown in Fig. 4b. This band-pass transmission is from the coupling of Bloch modes symmetric modes and bulk modes (although with a very small contribution). In fact the symmetric unit cell has no need to be periodic i.e. barrier widths can be different and accordingly the added well (for PS complement) might be unique for each local resonance. Figure 4c shows the transmission spectrum when the middle barrier width \({d}_{b}^{^{\prime}}=3\) nm of the symmetric InP/InAs/InP/InAs/InP unit cell. Similar coupling and improvement can also be obtained in arbitrary superlattice (not limited at Kronig-Penney superlattice) with symmetric unit cell while the width choice of each segment should support perfect resonances. Besides the one-dimensional nanowire superlattice the two- or three-dimensional semiconductor superlattice can also be studied by employing our approach such as the in-plane superlattice or out-plane superlattice of two-dimensional materials3738. Therein the incidence angle and parameter components along the superlattice are critical to the further interpretation.

Full size image

Noticed that resonances and modes coupling of our superlattice can also be interpreted by the Kard parametrization that in terms of both PS and impedance39. To verify the validity of our interpretation the theory of quantum–mechanical wave impedance (QMWI)1840 is introduced to calculated the 3-period superlattice again. The characteristic impedance of \(j\)th uniform segment (width \({d}_{j}\)) is defined as

$${Z}_{j0}=\frac{2\hslash {k}_{j}}{{m}_{j}}$$ (4)

and the impedance at the left side of \(j\)th segment can be calculated by using

$${Z}_{j}={Z}_{j0}\frac{{Z}_{j+1}\mathrm{cosh}\left(i{k}_{j}{d}_{j}\right)-{Z}_{j0}\mathrm{sinh}\left(i{k}_{j}{d}_{j}\right)}{{Z}_{j0}\mathrm{cosh}\left(i{k}_{j}{d}_{j}\right)-{Z}_{j+1}\mathrm{sinh}\left(i{k}_{j}{d}_{j}\right)}$$ (5)

It should be noted that the impedance of the rightmost segment equals to its characteristic impedance because of no potential discontinuity any more. After repeatedly calculating with Eq. (5) the impedance of the whole superlattice can be obtained written as \({Z}_{S}\) which can be regarded as the load impedance of the whole superlattice. Thus the transmission probability is given by

$$\mathcal{T}=1-{\left|t\right|}^{2}$$ (6)

\(t=\left({Z}_{S}-{Z}_{\mathrm{10}}\right)/\left({Z}_{S}+{Z}_{\mathrm{10}}\right)\). The calculated results of the 3-period superlattice are shown in Fig. 4b–e. It is found that the transmission probabilities obtained from two different approaches agree well with each other. In the band-pass region the real part of the load impedance \({Z}_{S}\) is close to the characteristic impedance \({Z}_{\mathrm{10}}\) and the imagine part tends to zero indicating the good impedance matching for the band-pass transmission.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYXRpbWVzLmNvLmtyL3BhZ2VzL2FydGljbGUuYXNwP25ld3NJZHg9MzI4NTcy0gE_aHR0cHM6Ly9tLmtvcmVhdGltZXMuY28ua3IvcGFnZXMvYXJ0aWNsZS5hbXAuYXNwP25ld3NJZHg9MzI4NTcy?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Samsung faces bumpy road ahead to becoming system chip leader,"

Goal of becoming No. 1 foundry player appears elusive



By Baek Byung-yeul



Three years have passed since Samsung Electronics ambitiously declared that it will become the global leader in system semiconductors by 2030 but the chip giant is still suffering from sluggish growth in the sector that includes processing chips and the foundry business according to industry analysts.



They say Samsung's growth potential especially in the foundry business that manufactures chips for fabless customers lags behind its biggest rival TSMC in terms of production capacity. As a result its global market share remains unchanged since 2019 unable to catch up with the Taiwanese competitor.



Analysts stress that Samsung needs to make sizable corporate acquisitions in order to make a breakthrough. But the company's leadership vacancy in which Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong is currently unavailable to return to his post due to legal issues makes it that much more difficult for the chip giant to take necessary steps.



The United States has tightened restrictions on exports of technology to China which prompted analysts to project that Samsung will try to seek a breakthrough by investing in promising startups rather than buying big companies in order to avoid attracting the attention of regulatory officials at semiconductor powerhouse countries.



""It may be possible for Samsung to catch up with TSMC in the foundry sector to produce expensive semiconductors using the latest manufacturing process. In order to achieve Samsung's 2030 goal there are seven years left and Samsung needs to invest more than three times its current expenditure assuming that TSMC does nothing. So when it comes to overall production capacity it is difficult to say that it will catch up with the Taiwanese company by 2030"" Kim Yang-paeng a senior researcher at the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade (KIET) said.



On April 30 Samsung's vice chairman declared that the company ""will take first place in the system semiconductor field including foundry"" at its Hwaseong plant in Gyeonggi Province.



To that end Samsung announced a major plan to invest 133 trillion won ($105 billion) by 2030 only in the system semiconductor sector. The company added last year that it would inject 38 trillion won more.



However Samsung's competitiveness has not improved significantly since then. In the market for mobile application processor chips which serve as the brain of mobile devices Samsung's share fell to 6.6 percent in 2021 from 12 percent in 2019 according to data by Strategy Analytics. During the same period Qualcomm's share increased from 34.8 percent to 37.7 percent while Apple's share increased from 22.9 percent to 26 percent.



Samsung's market share by revenue in the global foundry business in 2021 also remained at second place with an 18-percent share following TSMC with 53 percent according to data by market tracker TrendForce. But the market share gap between the No. 1 and No. 2 players could widen further as the Taiwanese company is estimated to account for 56 percent and Samsung 16 percent.



Although Samsung is trying to enhance its presence in the foundry business the market researcher estimated the dominance of Taiwanese companies in the sector will be solidified this year.



""Under the looming shadow of chip shortages caused by the pandemic and geopolitical turmoil in the past two years various governments have quickly become aware of the fact that localization of chip manufacturing is necessary to avoid being cut off from access to chips due to logistics difficulties or cross-border shipment bans. Taiwanese companies have ridden this wave to become partners that governments around the world are eager to invite to set up factories in various locales"" TrendForce said.



The KIET researcher said however that Samsung's 2030 declaration needs to be interpreted as a bid to beef up what the company has not been good at.



""The system semiconductor we're talking about contains a wide variety of parts such as CPU and foundry semiconductor production. Intel is still the No. 1 player in system semiconductors and TSMC is No. 1 only in the semiconductor foundry area"" he said.



""I think it is right to interpret the 2030 vision to mean that Samsung will do better in areas where it has been poor at rather than criticizing why it still remains behind strong players"" the senior researcher said.



While questions have been raised that Samsung would lose its customers in the foundry business that produce chips using the latest technologies such as below 4-nanometer production technology a Samsung executive denied the speculations saying its order backlog in the foundry business has been on a steady increase.



""Contrary to concerns about our semiconductor foundry business demand from major customers currently remains solid"" Kang Moon-soo senior vice president and head of Samsung's foundry market and strategy team said during a conference call on April 28.



""Over the next five years the balance of orders is eight times larger than the sales in foundry business last year"" the executive said.



Regarding the speculation that Samsung is lagging far behind TSMC in terms of 4-nanometer process Kang said ""The 5-nanometer process has entered the stage of a mature yield rate and is maximizing supply to major customers. The expansion of production in the initial stage of the 4-nanometer process was somewhat delayed but we are currently entering the expected yield improvement curve by focusing on stabilization.""



A local semiconductor industry source said ""Samsung's detailed explanation of its foundry business was aimed at dispelling market concerns.""



""There have been concerns in the market that Samsung is losing its foundry customers who ordered the production of chips based on the 4-nanometer process due to a low yield rate. The company officially confirmed that such concerns are different from what the company sees"" the official said asking not to be identified.



Leadership vacuum becomes obstacle for corporate acquisition



Industry experts pointed out that sizable corporate acquisitions are needed for Samsung to take a step forward but the company has faced obstacles due to a leadership vacuum.



""Samsung needs to acquire companies with high growth potential to strengthen its business portfolio but its leader Lee Jae-yong is currently embroiled in legal issues so there is no one who can make a risk-taking decision"" Kim Dae-jong a professor of business administration at Sejong University said.



""The role of a leader is very important to Korean conglomerates. This is because the business proceeds only after they take responsibility and take over other companies or execute the investment with lots of money"" he said.



Lee is not allowed to return to management until 2027 due to a five-year ban imposed by the Ministry of Justice. He was convicted of offering bribes to former President Park Geun-hye and has been on parole since August 2021.



Industry officials said Samsung has been preparing to buy another company and recently organized a taskforce led by Vice Chairman Han Jong-hee. In April the company also recruited former Bank of America banker Marco Chisari who's known as a takeover expert in the semiconductor business.



""Acquiring another company is the fastest way to change a company's business structure. However even if Samsung decides to acquire a company it will not be easy to get approval from other countries"" the KIET researcher said.

As the third Applied Materials location in the Flathead Valley the new facility will bring 200 new jobs to the region. Job positions range from manufacturers to engineers to managers and the company already employs 600 people in the Flathead Valley alone. The expansion will bring the total square footage to 350000 among three buildings.

The semiconductor-plating manufacturer has seen significant growth over the last two years adding thousands of employees to all branches which includes facilities in Austin Texas and Singapore.

“The demand has never been greater (for microchips)” Dennis McHaffie the vice president of business operations for Applied Materials said at a ribbon cutting ceremony in Evergreen on May 4. “We can’t ship them fast enough – we’re having all of the right problems.”

Applied Materials’ expansion will bring hundreds of more jobs to the valley and the company’s officials have already been busy recruiting employees for their other locations.

Montana Site General Manager Brian Aegerter says there are currently 50 job openings for Kalispell’s two established campuses and recruitment teams will phase in 200 more for the new location in Evergreen over the next year and a half.

Aegerter says the company has been hosting weekly job fairs and recruitment efforts have been gaining strides in the last few weeks.

Most job openings are for manufacturing positions Aegerter said which include benefits and range from $17 per hour to almost $30 per hour depending on experience.

While the valley continues to struggle to recruit and retain employees Kalispell Mayor Mark Johnson spoke at the ceremony and reassured the audience that local government agencies are doing what they can to bring more housing to the region for potential employees which remains a recruitment challenge.

“As we grow as a community we have a lot of challenges” Johnson said. “We have to hire 200 new people for this building and that is the next challenge. We are doing what we can to deliver housing.”

In addition to staffing shortages Applied Materials also continues to struggle with supply chain constraints as shutdowns in China and the war in Ukraine disrupt production.

“Supply chain issues are getting worse actually” Aegerter said. “The interdependency on the supply chain has become a problem. When one area has a problem the ripple effect is amplified.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmVrYWxlcnQub3JnL211bHRpbWVkaWEvODkzNDU40gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amir Arbabi Gabriel Popescu [IMAGE],"Illinois researchers -- from left graduate student Amir Arbabi professor Gabriel Popescu graduate student Chris Edwards and professor Lynford Goddard -- use a special microscope to simultaneously etch tiny features in semiconductor wafers and monitor the process in real time.

On Saturday night that was a formula that helped FC Tulsa snap a four-game losing streak against USL Championship foes.

Rivas scored twice and da Costa had a goal to help FC Tulsa snap Detroit City FC's four-game winning streak 3-1 in the clubs' first-ever meeting before 4311 fans at ONEOK Field.

FC Tulsa (4-6-0 12 points) was the first team to score more than one goal against Detroit City (5-2-2 17 points) this season. Detroit entered the night with only four goals allowed in eight games.

""I’m so happy for the players the way they played and that they can get a win under their belt"" FC Tulsa coach Michael Nsien said. ""It’s the start of some momentum that we want to create and hopefully run it for a few weeks or even through the end of the season.”

Rivas and da Costa began this season tied for Tulsa's career goals lead but da Costa had moved ahead by two before Rivas' performance Saturday cut the margin to 28-27.

“We both push each other"" Rivas said. ""He’s a great player and a great teammate as well. I’m happy for him as well and it’s on – like I said we have to keep pushing each other and hopefully well both get 10-plus goals in this season.”

The last time each of them scored in the same game was in the 3-1 home-opening win against Birmingham Legion FC on March 19. That also was the last time that Rivas had scored until he finished off a long run in the 15th minute Saturday with a blast past goalkeeper Nate Schwanscher from the penalty arc.

Six minutes later da Costa scored from close range assisted by JJ Williams for a 2-0 lead. That was the first assist this season for Williams who leads FC Tulsa with five goals.

A common denominator in each of FC Tulsa's losses during the four-game streak was giving up a goal in the first 15 minutes.

""It was more about being aggressive (tonight) and finding the moments to attack and how we can exploit them and being disciplined and organized on our end"" Nsien said.

Tulsa's lead was cut to 2-1 when it allowed a goal off a corner kick in the 36th minute as Detroit's Michael Bryant scored after a scramble in front of goalkeeper Sean Lewis.

In the 72nd minute Lewis made a big save on Macky Diop to preserve FC Tulsa's lead. Out of the last eight USL games at ONEOK Field Diop was playing in his third as an opponent for his third different team. He came to Tulsa last October with Atlanta United II and was with Birmingham in March. Lewis who picked up his first career assist off a long ball on the first goal also came up with a save during stoppage time as FC Tulsa ended a six-game streak of giving up two or more goals.

“It was good to get the monkey off our back"" Lewis said about ending the losing streak. ""I thought we put in a good shift and equally as important as the three points we just played better. It was a result of coming out with a strong performance on the ball and off the ball. Defensively we did pretty well too. It was a little disappointing to concede off a corner kick but the process is working – we’re showing improvement and it’s a long season so if we can keep on improving it’s going to be good towards the end.”

Rivas scored the clinching goal in the 78th minute after Jorge Corrales' long cross from left wing was deflected high in the air when FC Tulsa's Brian Brown battled a defender for the ball and as it came down Rivas fired a one-timer into the net.

Another one of FC Tulsa's career goals leader Dario Suarez subbed in for the final few minutes. Suarez wearing a mask in his first game since a recent facial surgery fired just wide right on a free kick as the match ended. But Rivas's two goals sandwiched around da Costa's goal were enough and the victory fireworks were launched for the first time in over a month.

“It’s a boost of confidence for myself as well getting those two goals and for the team"" Rivas said. ""We know what we’re capable of and I think we’ve been suffering a lot way too much and I think tonight we were just like ‘we need to put an end to this and it starts tonight.’""

Architecture 1 and 2 are covered in the Blog SSL Offloading at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Load Balancer for Oracle Analytics Server on Oracle Cloud Marketplace.

Below are some architectures having Oracle HTTP Server (Web Server) along with Load Balancer

Oracle HTTP Server can be run on separate compute instance or on the same compute instance as Oracle Analytics Server.

Can perform SSL Offloading SSL at the Load Balancer or at Oracle HTTP Server in both the Architectures

Architecture 5 with Single Oracle HTTP Server and Oracle Analytics Server SSL Offloading at Web Server:

The Oracle HTTP Server and Oracle Analytics Server are in Private Subnet Create the Load Balancer on Public Subnet of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

Architecture 5

Generate SSL Certificates for Load Balancer

# Generate new server key

openssl genrsa -aes256 -passout pass:Oracle123 -out ./server.key 2048

# Take backup of server.key

cp ./server.key ./server-orig.key

# Remove the PassPhrase from server.key

openssl rsa -passin pass:Oracle123 -in ./server-orig.key -out ./server.key

# Delete the backup of the key

rm ./server-orig.key

# Generate server certificate sign request i.e server.csr

openssl req -subj ""/C=US/ST=California/L=RedwoodShores/O=Oracle Corporation/OU=CEAL Team/CN=analytics.cealoracle.com"" -out ./server.csr -key ./server.key -new -sha256

# Share the CSR file with your IT and get it Signed by Internal or Public Well Known Certificate Authority.

# Rename the server.key as analytics_cealoracle_com.key and the server.crt (from CA) as analytics_cealoracle_com.crt

NOTE: Use the Load Balancer DNS Name as e.g. analytics.cealoracle.com in the next steps.

Install and Configure Oracle HTTP Server as Web Server to Oracle Analytics Server on Oracle Cloud Marketplace

For details on Install and Configure Oracle HTTP Server see Configuring Oracle HTTP Server for an Enterprise Deployment

NOTE: Install OHS on same compute as Oracle Analytics Server.

Open the 7777 and 4443 ports at the Firewall as root user

sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=7777/tcp

sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=4443/tcp

sudo firewall-cmd --complete-reload

Also open these ports 7777 4443 at the Security List of the Subnet

Configuration steps to enable SSL communication at Oracle HTTP Server

Create SSL Wallet for Oracle HTTP Server

Using Java Keytool Generate a Key Pair for Java Keystore

$JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -genkeypair -alias oas1 -keyalg RSA -sigalg SHA256withRSA -keysize 2048 -keypass Oracle123 -keystore myIdentity.jks -storepass Oracle123 -storetype JKS -validity 365 -dname ""CN= oas1.sub03xxxxxxxx91.oasvcn.oraclevcn.comOU=CEAL TeamO=Oracle CorporationL=RedwoodShores ST=CaliforniaC=US""

Above command will create a self-signed certificate and private key.

If you are ok with Self-Signed Certificate skip the next 4 commands

If you want the certificate to be signed by a CA Extract the CSR to get it signed by CA:

$JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -certreq -file oas1.csr -alias oas1 -sigalg SHA256withRSA -keystore myIdentity.jks -storepass Oracle123 -dname ""CN= oas1.sub03xxxxxxxx91.oasvcn.oraclevcn.comOU=CEAL TeamO=Oracle CorporationL=RedwoodShores ST=CaliforniaC=US""

NOTE: Get the oas1.csr signed by your Certificate Authority.

If you have Multiple Oracle HTTP Servers and you need Single Certificate for both the servers we need to create a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) based SSL Certificate.

Generate Private Key and Certificate:

keytool -genkey -alias oas1 -keyalg RSA -sigalg SHA256withRSA -keysize 2048 -keypass Oracle123 -keystore myIdentity.jks -storepass Oracle123 -storetype JKS -validity 365 -dname ""CN=ohs.cealoracle.comOU=CEAL TeamO=Oracle CorporationL=RedwoodShoresST=CaliforniaC=US"" -ext san=dns:oas1.sub03xxxxxxxx91.oasvcn.oraclevcn.comdns:oas2.sub03xxxxxxxx91.oasvcn.oraclevcn.com

Extract the CSR to get it signed by CA:

keytool -certreq -file oas1.csr -alias oas1 -sigalg SHA256withRSA -keystore myIdentity.jks -storepass Oracle123 -dname ""CN=ohs.cealoracle.comOU=CEAL TeamO=Oracle CorporationL=RedwoodShoresST=CaliforniaC=US"" -ext san= dns:oas1.sub03xxxxxxxx91.oasvcn.oraclevcn.comdns:oas2.sub03xxxxxxxx91.oasvcn.oraclevcn.com

Import the CA Intermediate certificate:

$JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -import -alias CAInter -file CAInter.crt -keystore myIdentity.jks -storepass Oracle123

Import the CA Root certificate:

$JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -import -alias CARoot -file CARoot.crt -keystore myIdentity.jks -storepass Oracle123

Import the CA Signed certificate:

$JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -import -alias oas1 -file oas1.crt -keystore myIdentity.jks -storepass Oracle123

Using orapki tool create Oracle Wallet

Create an empty wallet with auto login:

cd /oas/oas_install/Oracle_OHS/Middleware/Oracle_Home/user_projects/domains/ohs_domain/config/fmwconfig/components/OHS/ohs1

mkdir eWallet

/oas/oas_install/Oracle_OHS/Middleware/Oracle_Home/oracle_common/bin/orapki wallet create -wallet /oas/oas_install/Oracle_OHS/Middleware/Oracle_Home/user_projects/domains/ohs_domain/config/fmwconfig/components/OHS/ohs1/eWallet -auto_login -pwd Oracle123

Convert the myIdentity.jks Java Keystore to eWallet:

/oas/oas_install/Oracle_OHS/Middleware/Oracle_Home/oracle_common/bin/orapki wallet jks_to_pkcs12 -wallet /oas/oas_install/Oracle_OHS/Middleware/Oracle_Home/user_projects/domains/ohs_domain/config/fmwconfig/components/OHS/ohs1/eWallet -pwd Oracle123 -keystore myIdentity.jks -jkspwd Oracle123

Display to check the entries in the eWallet:

/oas/oas_install/Oracle_OHS/Middleware/Oracle_Home/oracle_common/bin/orapki wallet display -wallet /oas/oas_install/Oracle_OHS/Middleware/Oracle_Home/user_projects/domains/ohs_domain/config/fmwconfig/components/OHS/ohs1/eWallet -pwd Oracle123

Set the Wallet Location in ssl.conf file

cd /oas/oas_install/Oracle_OHS/Middleware/Oracle_Home/user_projects/domains/ohs_domain/config/fmwconfig/components/OHS/ohs1

vi ssl.conf

Comment existing SSLWallet parameter and set a new value

#SSLWallet “${ORACLE_INSTANCE}/config/${COMPONENT_TYPE}/${CMPONENT_NAME}/keystores/default”

Add New value

SSLWallet “/oas/oas_install/Oracle_OHS/Middleware/Oracle_Home/user_projects/domains/ohs_domain/config/fmwconfig/components/OHS/ohs1/eWallet”

If required set the SSLProtocol value as well.

e.g.

SSLProtocol ALL –SSLv2 –SSLv3 (If you need TLSv1.0 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2)

Or

SSLProtocol TLSv1.2 (If you need only TLSv1.2)

Set Load Balancer DNS Name as the ServerName in Oracle HTTP Server configuration

Edit httpd.conf file

At the Oracle HTTP Server edit httpd.conf and add ServerName analytics.cealoracle.com:80

Edit ssl.conf

At the Oracle HTTP Server edit ssl.conf and add ServerName analytics.cealoracle.com:443

When SSL is offloaded at Oracle HTTP Server follow below steps:

Enable WebLogic Plugin at the Domain Level in WebLogic admin console

At Oracle HTTP Server Config in the Location tag use WLProxySSL ON

At Oracle HTTP Server Config in the Location tag use WLProxySSLPassThrough ON

At Oracle HTTP Server Config in the Location tag use SecureProxy Off

Edit mod_wl_ohs.conf

In each <Location> tag or in the <IfModule weblogic_module> tag specify below parameters and their values as below

#WLSSLWallet “Path_to_Wallet_where_OAS_Server_CAIntermediate_CARoot_Certificates_imported”

#Above parameter is commented as we are offloading SSL at OHS and the OAS is not running in SSL.

WLProxySSL ON

WLProxySSLPassThrough ON

SecureProxy Off

#SecureProxy is set to off as the OAS Server is not running on SSL Port.

HTTP to HTTPS Redirection

Edit httpd.conf and set below parameter

cd /oas/oas_install/Oracle_OHS/Middleware/Oracle_Home/user_projects/domains/ohs_domain/config/fmwconfig/components/OHS/ohs1/httpd.conf

vi httpd.conf

At the end of the file enter below statement

Header edit Location ^http://(.*)$ https://$1

Restart Oracle HTTP Server

Configuring the WebLogic Proxy Plug-In

Before you can validate that requests are routed correctly through the Oracle HTTP Server instances you must set the WebLogic Plug-In Enabled parameter. It is recommended to set the WebLogic Plug-In Enabled parameter at the domain level.

Log in to the Oracle WebLogic Server Administration Console. In the Domain Structure pane click on the top-level domain node (bi). Click Lock & Edit in the Change Center. Click on the Domain Name. Click on the Web Applications tab. Locate and select the WebLogic PlugIn Enabled option. Click Save. Click Activate Changes in the Change Center. Restart the Administration Server.

NOTE: This step should be done before configuring Oracle HTTP Server as a Web Server to Oracle Analytics Server

In the WebLogic admin console enable WebLogic-Plugin at the Domain level

Restart all Services

Apache HTTP Server as Web Server for Oracle Analytics Server

Install and Configure Apache HTTP Server as Web Server for Oracle Analytics Server and SSL Offloading at Apache HTTP Server for more details see this Blog Configure Apache HTTP Server as Web Server to Oracle Analytics Server.

Configure a Load Balancer

1. Login to OCI Console as an Administrator

2. Navigate to Networking à Load Balancers

3. Select the Compartment where you need to config the Load Balancer

4. Create a Load Balancer

5. Select the Load Balancer Type as Load Balancer and click on Create Load Balancer

6. Create a Public Load Balancer

7. Create a Reserved IP Address so that we need not maintain the IP Address for the “A” Record in the DNS Server.

NOTE: You can create the Ephemeral IP Address also. Here we are using Reserved IP Address according to the usage.

LB Shapes: Flexible or Dynamic

Dynamic:

8. Specify the Load Balancer Policy as Weighted Round Robin

NOTE: Can use other Policies based on the type of configuration needed for the usage

9. Add Backends Either Select the Instances available in the compartment or the IP Address

10. Set the Backend application running port number

NOTE: Sometimes Status Code: 301 may not be the correct Status Code Health Check of the Backend Set may be Critical.

In such situations please use below command and check the correct Status Code and use it.

It can be 302 401 etc.

On any Linux or Windows Instance on the Public Subnet of the Load Balancer’s VCN or Bastion run below command and get the Status Code.

curl -k -vvv https://ohs-servername.com:4443/dv

This shows the Status Code

302 401 it there is a Single Sign-On configuration set at the Oracle HTTP Server.

11. Check the Checkbox Use SSL if your Backend Server application (i.e. Oracle HTTP Server) running on a SSL Port.

12. Upload the SSL Certificate details of the Backend Application

NOTE:

If there are multiple backends and each has its own SSL Certificate signed by the same CA then upload the CA Certificate only.

If there are multiple backends and have SAN based SSL certs for both the backends then upload the SAN certificate Private Key and CA Certificate.

13. Click on Advanced Options

a. If needed set a Backend Set Name

b. Disable Session Persistence (As we are adding only one Oracle Analytics Server Instance as Backend in this configuration)

NOTE: If there are multiple OHS nodes please use “Enable application cookie persistence” with cookie name as JSESSIONID.

14. Create the Listener and Specify the type of traffic the Listener handles as HTTPS

15. Upload the SSL Certificate for the Load Balancer

NOTE: Oracle Suggests to use Public Well Know CA Signed SSL Certificate.

NOTE: If the End Users connect to Oracle Analytics Server Instance through Intranet i.e. VPN and not from Internet In such cases we can use Internal CA Signed SSL Certificates and create the “A” Record at the Internal DNS Servers.

16. Enable Error Logs and Access Logs based on the requirement

Load Balancer is created

17. Add Hostname

NOTE: The Hostname should be the DNS entry matching the SSL Certificate

18. Assigned the Hostname to the Listener

19. Add “A” Record in Domain Provider’s DNS Management screen.

20. Allow Internet Traffic to the Load Balancer’s Public Subnet

Add an Ingress Rule to allow access from Internet (0.0.0.0/0) on port 443

Load Balancer is successfully configured

Now almost 30 years after The X-Files made her a global star the actress has a new slogan: ‘They’re always watching.’

That’s the tagline of a new advertising campaign she will front for Silicon Valley cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks that will net her £500000 The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Stunning: The 53-year-old was spotted in Central London last week filming four adverts which will be screened on TV and online

The 53-year-old was spotted in Central London last week filming four adverts which will be screened on TV and online.

Wearing a camel-coloured coat and brown suede stilettos the star – reportedly worth £30 million – looked glamorous during the shoot.

She accessorised her coat with a red brooch which is similar to Palo Alto’s logo.

The actress recently starred as Margaret Thatcher in Netflix drama The Crown and also played Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson in BBC2 crime drama The Fall as well as therapist Jean Milburn in Netflix comedy Sex Education.

Paranormal: As special agent Dana Scully Gillian Anderson always insisted: ‘The truth is out there.’

A source close to Palo Alto Networks said: ‘Despite having lots of roles since Gillian is fondly remembered for playing Scully. She was an iconic character so when you think of her you do think of aliens cyberspace and the paranormal. She is perfect for this job.’

He was 86. Gilley’s publicist confirmed the singer’s death.

While Gilley had a run of success in the Seventies singing barroom-piano country ballads and rave-ups like “Room Full of Roses” and “Don’t the Girls All Get Prettier at Closing Time” it was his second act in the Eighties — tied to 1980’s box-office hit Urban Cowboy — that turned the Mississippi native into a crossover star.

More from Rolling Stone

Born March 9 1936 in Natchez Mississippi and raised in nearby Ferriday Louisiana Gilley would become synonymous with the state of Texas when he opened his nightclub Gilley’s in Pasadena a town just outside Houston. The venue was massive — “the world’s largest honky-tonk” it boasted — with a capacity of 6000 a rodeo arena and a mechanical bull for the brave and inebriated alike to ride. But when Gilley’s opened in 1971 its namesake was still years away from becoming a singing star. In 1974 he scored his first country music Number One with “Room Full of Roses” and went on to top the charts with versions of songs by George Jones (“The Window Up Above”) Bill Anderson (“City Lights”) and Sam Cooke (“Bring It on Home to Me”).

As a showman Gilley — the cousin of Jerry Lee Lewis — exuded charisma. He wore a massive cowboy hat with a feather band and sparkly rings and pendants often in the shape of his initials. In 1976 he turned an offensive-by-today’s-standards song called “Don’t the Girls All Get Prettier at Closing Time” into a Number One on sheer charm delivering outrageous lyrics about rating women on a scale of 1 to 10 with a sly wink. “When tomorrow morning comes and I wake up with a number one” Gilley sang “I swear I’ll never do it anymore.” He stayed mostly within the country chart’s Top 10 in the late Seventies but began to sputter as the decade came to a close.

Enter John Travolta. In 1980 the movie heartthrob introduced country & western cosplay to America as the star of Urban Cowboy a film about an oil worker who lets off steam riding the mechanical bull at Gilley’s club. Based on a 1979 Esquire story the movie became a pop-culture sensation and spawned a smash soundtrack featuring songs by Kenny Rogers Charlie Daniels Band and Johnny Lee whose “Lookin’ for Love” was all but inescapable at the time. Gilley also had a cut on the soundtrack — a version of Ben E. King’s “Stand By Me” that topped the country survey and hit Number 22 on the Hot 100.

With “Stand By Me” and his Urban Cowboy ubiquity pushing him forward Gilley continued to earn hits: 1981’s “A Headache Tomorrow (Or a Heartache Tonight)” 1982’s “Talk to Me” and 1983’s “Fool for Your Love” among them. He also started acting in Eighties TV series like CHiPs Fantasy Island and The Fall Guy and kept recording albums well into the Nineties. In 1990 he opened the Mickey Gilley Theater in Branson Missouri where he’d often perform with his fellow Urban Cowboy crooner Johnny Lee.

“[Urban Cowboy] launched me into the stratosphere” Gilley told Rolling Stone in 2015 going on to recount how the movie and Travolta ignited not only his career but Western fashion. “I was in an elevator in Nashville one day back in Eighties. There was a guy on there who said ‘I want to thank you for all you did for Western wear.’ And I said ‘You need to thank John Travolta. He’s the one who brought it front and center.’ Every night when I go to bed I thank John Travolta for keeping my career alive.”

I don’t normally accept guest posts but was happy to make an exception for Sure Dividend since I used to do some shared work with them regarding dividend stock analysis a few years ago.

With stocks selling off this is a good time to start going through your watch lists to see what types of otherwise high-quality assets are selling off. Josh presents a quick list of companies with at least 50 years of consecutive annual dividend growth that he considers to be long-term “buys” at this time which you can use for further research.

______

When it comes to compounding wealth we feel that buying high-quality dividend stocks and reinvesting dividends over time is the best path. This allows for not only the capital appreciation that great dividend stocks tend to provide over time but the ability to achieve the double compounding of reinvesting dividends. When executing this strategy however it is paramount to find the best dividend stocks that can stand the test of time.

The Dividend Kings are the best-of-the-best when it comes to dividend longevity. They are a group of 44 companies that have paid rising dividends for at least 50 consecutive years. In this article we’ll highlight why investors would find the Dividend Kings attractive and note the five best Dividend Kings available in the market today.

Why Dividend Kings?

The reason that an investor would want to consider the Dividend Kings is quite simple; they are the best stocks in the world in terms of dividend longevity and safety. Companies that have been able to raise their dividends for at least 50 consecutive years have withstood competitive threats recessions technological changes and more. That’s why the Dividend Kings are the gold standard for dividend investing and while the yields the Dividend Kings offer aren’t always the highest available investors can count on rising income over time very reliably.

Below we’ll take a brief look at the five best Dividend Kings available in the market today.

The Top 5 Dividend Kings Now

Our first Dividend King is Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) the ubiquitous tool and storage maker based in the US. Stanley makes a wide variety of tools and accessories under brands such as BLACK+DECKER Stanley Dewalt Craftsman Porter Cable and more. The company was founded in 1843 and has chosen a growth-by-acquisition strategy to augment its robust organic growth over time. We see the company producing 8% annualized earnings-per-share growth in the years to come meaning it should have plenty of capital to continue raising its dividend.

The current yield is 2.6% which is very high by historical standards for this stock and is about double that of the S&P 500. The dividend increase streak stands at 54 years and the payout ratio is only about one-third of earnings for this year so there is a huge runway for future dividend growth as well as a high level of safety.

Our next stock is Tennant Company (TNC) which designs manufactures and markets floor cleaning equipment globally. Tennant offers a huge array of cleaning equipment to suit a variety of needs as well as financing rental and leasing programs. Tennant was founded in 1870 and recently became an addition to the Dividend Kings club with its 50th consecutive dividend increase.

We expect Tennant to be able to produce 8% annual earnings-per-share growth so combined with its 21% payout ratio for this year the stock sports exemplary dividend safety as well as growth potential. The current yield is 1.6% which is better than the broader market but somewhat lower than more traditional high-yield dividend stocks. However the stock is trading for a decade-low valuation at the moment so we see strong capital appreciation potential over time as well for buyers of the stock today.

Our next stock is 3M Company (MMM) a diversified technology company that operates globally in a variety of industries. The company competes in Safety and Industrial Transportation and Electronics Health Care and Consumer segments spanning thousands of products and countless end markets. 3M has made a name for itself in the past 120 years for innovation and quality and it is constantly revamping its product portfolio to position it well for the coming years.

We see 5% annual growth ahead for 3M and its current yield is exceptional at 4%. That’s high not only for 3M but it is also about three times that of the S&P 500. The payout ratio is just over half of earnings but keep in mind that 3M’s earnings are generally highly predictable so it can carry a higher payout ratio. We like 3M for its exceptional yield its 64-year dividend increase streak and its predictable income streams.

Our fourth Dividend King is Lowe’s Companies (LOW) half of the home improvement duopoly in the US. Lowe’s has about 2000 home improvement super centers in the US offering tens of thousands of products to professionals and property owners. Lowe’s has a 59-year streak of boosting its dividend but despite this the payout ratio is just 24% on this year’s earnings. That means Lowe’s will continue to have enough capital to keep raising the payout particularly in light of estimate growth of 6% annually.

The yield is on the lower end at 1.6% but that is still in excess of the broader market. Lowe’s has managed one of the best dividend growth rates anywhere in the market in the past decade coming in at more than 17%.

Our final stock is Parker-Hannifin (PH) a manufacturer of motion and control systems for mobile industrial and aerospace markets worldwide. The company has more than a century of brand name recognition and expertise which have helped it boost its dividend for a staggering 65 consecutive years. The yield is currently at 1.9% following some weakness in the stock. That has also made the valuation attractive given we expect 9% annual earnings-per-share growth in the coming years. Parker-Hannifin’s payout ratio is just 22% for this year meaning that its projected growth and low payout ratio should provide plenty of fuel for higher dividends in the years to come. The company’s average annual increase in the dividend is just over 10% for the past decade putting the stock is rare company on that measure.

Final Thoughts

When searching for a great dividend stock to buy we believe it is prudent to start the search with the Dividend Kings. They are the class of the field when it comes to dividend safety and longevity and many of them offer either high current yields – like 3M – or high rates of dividend growth – like Lowe’s. We’ve highlighted five names we believe rise to the top of the highly prestigious Dividend Kings and we like all of them as buy-rated stocks in today’s market.",,,,,,,,,,,,

However the war in Ukraine has brought particular attention to sunflower oil and seeds due to Ukraine’s position in global trade flows of the commodities – and the ingredients’ presence in the recipes of scores of food products from crisps and cakes to dressings and margarines let alone due to the popularity among consumers of sunflower oil for cooking.

The ongoing conflict has led to the suspension of oilseed crushing operations and question marks surrounding the ability of Ukrainian suppliers to get their products out of the country amid port closures and restrictions on the movement of goods due to the fighting. And across the border sanctions imposed on Russia by governments globally make exporting these ingredients difficult for Russian producers.

At the moment hardly anyone outside Ukraine knows with any degree of certainty what the situation is like on the ground.

“On sunflowers specifically I think the answer is we just don’t know – no-one knows because things change on a daily basis” says Cyrille Filott global strategist for consumer foods packaging and logistics at Netherlands-based financial services group Rabobank. “When I’m talking to suppliers of companies in the food sector they’re saying it’s quite difficult to get your hands on sunflower oil. It is possible but at prices where you think ‘really?’ It’s just not economically viable. I’ve talked to many supply chain procurement people in the last few weeks and they are just scrambling to make sure that they get supply.”

Food groups are reluctant to discuss the war in Ukraine and go into specific details about the impact it’s having on their operations. A spokesperson for UK-based KP Snacks – part of Germany’s Intersnack Group – says the company has “contingency options in place to protect continuity of supply from global suppliers”.

David Wilkinson vice president of agriculture and dairy for PepsiCo’s European operations adds: “The war in Ukraine has cast a long shadow over the global food system. Ukraine is a significant producer of many agricultural ingredients and like many food companies we source commodities like sunflower oil from the country. We have a plan in place to minimise disruption and impact to our products.”

Food manufacturers indicating impact

John B. Sanfilippo & Son a publicly-listed US supplier of snack products highlighted sunflower oil when asked in recent days by equity analysts about the inflationary pressure it is seeing from the conflict.

“I think the most pressing thing that we’re seeing from Ukraine is regarding sunflower oil” COO Jasper Sanfilippo said last Friday (29 April). “I think Ukraine grow something like 60% of the world’s sunflower oil. So as you can imagine that’s put pressure on a lot of other oils including for ourselves because we do have some product lines that use sunflower oil. We’re currently reviewing that and trying to find substitute oils to replace that with sunflower. So that work is ongoing.”

Hain Celestial another US manufacturer also raised the topic this week (5 May) when discussing its recent financial results with Wall Street analysts. “With 75% of the world’s sunflower oil coming from Russia and Ukraine and 60% of the palm oil coming from Indonesia which has said they’re not going to export any of it there is a supply-demand issue with regard to oils which affects our Spectrum [oils and vinegars] business [and] affects our snacks business. And so we seek to find alternatives in a very constrained environment and that comes at a cost.”

Steve Osborn a director at UK-based Aurora Ceres which offers food technology and innovation support for food manufacturers says the additional pressures being placed on commodity staples like sunflower oil from Ukraine is going to have a significant impact on the industry.

“This is going to have a wide-ranging effect as sunflower oil is used throughout the industry in cooking and as an ingredient” says Osborn. “The impact of availability and the corresponding impact this has on cost will be distributed across many products. And not always in areas where it might be expected. This is unfortunately inevitable.”

Kyle Holland pricing analyst for Mintec looking at oilseeds and grains agrees and points out it’s not just the price and supply of sunflower oils from the war-stricken region that’s affected by the crisis.

“The way that the oils ‘work’ I think is important to note; vegetable oils are ‘complex’ in that they often move in related ways as they can replace each other” says Holland. “What this means is that demand that would be usually taken by sunflower oil is spilling over to the other oils increasing demand for them and those prices in turn. This is a way in which companies are attempting to ‘get around’ the issues by simply replacing the sunflower oil content with another oil.”

When it comes to sourcing and using replacement oils there are multiple options – some more problematic than others. The most contentious replacement for sunflower oil is palm oil. In the past a number of companies stopped using palm oil due to environmental concerns and some retailers have also taken a hardline stance towards its use.

“The UK retailer Iceland which has been very proactive in the elimination of palm oil has stated that they will be allowing the use of palm oil where sunflower oil is not available or prohibitively expensive” says Holland. “This shift is very much counter to the recent focus on ethical and sustainability as drivers in shopping habits.”

However for some food businesses palm oil is now back on the menu and governments are loosening restrictions on the use of alternative ingredients. Last week France announced changes to rules food manufacturers must follow on recipe labelling amid the pressure on sunflower oil supplies.

Experts believe the easing of such rules will only be a short-term move. Nevertheless in the case of palm oil another challenge has emerged in recent days. On 28 April Indonesia the world’s largest producer of palm oil banned exports in order Jakarta said to protect domestic supplies and push down prices.

“This is highly significant due to low veg oil stocks globally high destination demand and key buyers being short on cover” says Holland. “The market expects this to be very bullish for prices as buyers are forced to either scramble for the limited palm oil supply or look to alternative oils. Naturally no-one yet knows how high prices may go but the next few days will be key.”

Prospect of product adulteration?

Osborn also points out that wherever there is pressure on a supply chain – through availability cost or complexity – it creates an opportunity for the less scrupulous fringes of the food industry.

“The situation in Ukraine could potentially open avenues for the adulteration of cooking oils” he cautions. “The cost and availability of virgin olive oil have for many years been a victim of this and anecdotally more virgin olive oil is produced than should be available from the olives grown.

“We could now see a similar situation arise from the pressure on vegetable oil availability with adulterated product being passed off as premium quality.

“Not only does this have issues from a quality perspective but also the overall product integrity as the undeclared adulterant may not be from a food-safe source and the other component used to mask or enhance the quality perception may also not be food grade.”

Even when food groups get their hands on alternative ingredients from legitimate sources they may also face pressure on sales due to the changing flavour profiles of their products according to Filott.

“I heard from a producer of crisps – who use a lot of sunflower oil – that the challenge is reformulation” he explains. “There’s a taste difference that you get especially with crisps where it’s quite significant. If you have [strong] English flavours like salt and vinegar you can basically mask the [flavour of] rapeseed but with more natural flavours that’s a bit of a challenge. So you have to think about reformulation and do you only reformulate some products and for others you use very expensive sunflower.”

Filott believes that in the longer term the supply-chain issues caused by the conflict in Ukraine will ultimately lead more food manufacturers to rethink how they source ingredients – including what type of ingredients they source and where these ingredients come from – and this could see a push towards nearshoring or onshoring. He admits implementing these supply chain changes will carry a price premium but argues companies should consider it as an insurance policy. “You’re essentially paying a higher price for de-risking your supply chain” adds Filott.

The outlook

While many companies may be reluctant to take such dramatic steps if the conflict continues they may have no choice but to explore these options. The FAO estimates that between 20-30% of areas sown to winter crops in Ukraine will remain unharvested during the 2022/23 season with the yields of these crops likely to be adversely affected. And the ability to plant crops in the spring crop cycle will also be impacted which could have longer-term implications warns Holland.

“This is due to a lack of farm inputs such as pesticides fertiliser diesel to operate farm machinery and labour to tend the fields” he says. “The view from my contacts within the industry is that sunflower seed in particular will not be well planted over April and May due to the litany of issues most notably the fact that the key producing areas tend to be in the east of Ukraine where the Russian forces are particularly active. This would mean that the significant issues we have this year are likely to be drawn out as next year’s crop could be poor even if Ukraine are able to export by then.”

This week EU vegetable-oil trade association FEDOIL said the availability of sunflower oil was “improving”. The organisation said sunflower seeds and oil were coming out of Ukraine albeit mostly by rail and truck rather than sea as would normally be the case.

“These volumes will not reach the volumes that were shipped before the beginning of the war by sea vessel but they are improving the market situation and help vegetable oil refiners responding to sunflower oil demand in the EU. With the current increased availability of sunflower oil prices have dropped compared to rapeseed oil and the switches into rapeseed oil have stopped” FEDOIL said.

There is no question however that the conflict has significantly disrupted supply and even if there are reports of some improvement food manufacturers will be facing some tricky decisions in the weeks ahead.

Rating: About this rating Labeled Satire

Fact Check

On May 6 2022 the website Vancouver Times published an article claiming that Rady Johnson the executive vice president and chief compliance quality and risk officer of the pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. was arrested and charged with fraud after thousands of incriminated documents were released:

VP of Pfizer arrested after document dump Rady Johnson the executive Vice President of Pfizer has been arrested at his home and charged with multiple counts of fraud by federal agents. He was taken into custody and is awaiting a bail hearing. This comes as 1000s of classified documents from Pfizer were released showing the true risks of the experimental vaccine.



The false claim originated with Vancouver Times a website that describes its content as ""satirical.""

This was not a genuine news item and the central claim is false. Rady Johnson has neither been arrested nor charged with fraud or any other crime. No legitimate news sources have reported such an incident.

Vancouver Times the original source of this fabricated story describes its own content as follows:

Current evidence indicates that COVID-19 vaccines don’t impair ovarian function nor cause the immune system to cross-react to the placental protein syncytin-1.

Inadequate support: Pfizer’s safety surveillance document contains adverse events reported following vaccination. These reports on their own are insufficient to demonstrate that the vaccine caused the adverse events or is unsafe.

Lack of context: COVID-19 vaccines might cause small changes in women’s menstrual cycles. However these are within natural variation and don’t suggest any safety problems with the vaccine. KEY TAKE AWAY Pregnant women are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant women. COVID-19 also increases the risk of pregnancy complications including preterm delivery and stillbirth. COVID-19 vaccines can prevent these risks and aren’t associated with any safety issues during pregnancy. Therefore public health authorities recommend that pregnant women get a COVID-19 vaccine.

FULL CLAIM: “women’s immune systems would also make an immune response to their own placental protein”; lipid nanoparticles “are dispersed throughout the entire body” and “accumulate in ovaries”; Women’s periods are messed up all over the place”

REVIEW

On 27 April 2022 The Epoch Times published an article in which gynecologist James Thorp and former Pfizer scientific advisor Michael Yeadon associated COVID-19 vaccines with poorer pregnancy outcomes and fertility problems. The article received more than 5000 interactions on Facebook and Twitter according to the social media analytics tool CrowdTangle.

Claims that COVID-19 vaccines reduce fertility increase the risk of miscarriage and cause menstrual changes aren’t new and likely contributed to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among pregnant women who are at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant women. A 2021 report from NewsGuard an online tool that rates the credibility of news and information websites and tracks misinformation listed such claims among the top COVID-19 vaccine myths spreading online.

As we explain below these claims are unsubstantiated by scientific evidence. Data from safety monitoring and multiple studies show that COVID-19 vaccines don’t impair conception or fertility and don’t increase the risk of spontaneous abortion stillbirth preterm birth low birth weight and neonatal death[1-5]. In contrast several studies indicate that developing COVID-19 during pregnancy increases the risk of preterm birth stillbirth and neonatal death[6-8]. Therefore health authorities like the U.S. CDC recommend COVID-19 vaccination for people who want to conceive and are pregnant or breastfeeding.

This review analyzes the claims in The Epoch Times article in detail and explains why they are inaccurate and misleading.

Claim 1 (Inaccurate):

“[I]n responding to the synthetic piece of virus spike protein women’s immune systems would also make an immune response to their own placental protein”

This claim originated from a 2020 open letter written by Yeadon and physician Wolfgang Wodarg and was debunked multiple times by Health Feedback and other fact-checking organizations. In brief Yeadon and Wodarg claimed that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains a sequence of amino acids—the building blocks of proteins—that is also present in syncytin-1 a human protein that has a crucial role in the correct formation of the placenta during pregnancy.

Based on this alleged similarity Yeadon and Wodarg assumed that the immune response generated against the spike protein through COVID-19 vaccination would also target the body’s own placental protein and cause sterility due to a phenomenon called cross-reactivity.

However the sequence that syncytin-1 and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have in common involves only four amino acids which is too short to trigger a cross-reaction of the immune system according to experts. Geneticists and immunologists found that this small sequence was also present in many other human proteins some of them essential for the body’s function like actin collagen and hemoglobin. Cross-reaction against these proteins would have caused evident disorders in people who received the vaccine something that wasn’t observed in clinical trials.

Akiko Iwasaki a professor of immunology at Yale School of Medicine went even further and disproved the claim experimentally communicating the results in an opinion article for the New York Times in January 2021. If Wodarg and Yeadon’s claim were true the antibodies generated against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein through infection would also cross-react with syncytin-1. Iwasaki and another researcher Alice Lu-Culligan analyzed serum from women with COVID-19 and found no cross-reaction between the patient’s antibodies and syncytin-1. These results directly contradicted Yeadon’s claim.

A study published in October 2021 by researchers in Singapore arrived at the same conclusion[9]. The authors examined plasma from 66 individuals collected before vaccination 21 days after the first dose and two months after the second dose and found no cross-reactivity to syncytin-1 after vaccination.

In December 2021 Iwasaki’s group published a preprint—a manuscript that hasn’t undergone peer review—showing that COVID-19 vaccines didn’t cause fetal defects nor increased anti-syncytin-1 antibody blood levels in pregnant mice[10].

Another preprint published in May 2021 analyzed the levels of human syncytin-1 antibodies in the plasma and breast milk of ten pregnant and five breastfeeding women before and after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine[11]. While all women had high antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein four to seven weeks after vaccination their antibody levels against syncytin-1 remained very low. Yeadon misrepresented a slight increase in syncytin-1 antibody signal after vaccination as evidence of “an immune response to their own placental protein”. However the authors clarified that all the samples were well below the positive threshold for syncytin-1. They concluded:

“BNT162B2-vaccinated women did not transmit vaccine mRNA to breast milk and did not produce a concurrent humoral response to syncytin-1 suggesting that cross-reactivity to syncytin-1 on the developing trophoblast or other adverse effects in the breast-fed infant from vaccine mRNA ingestion are unlikely.”

Claim 2 (Inaccurate and Misleading):

“The vast majority of those [lipid nanoparticles] are dispersed throughout the entire body” “[T]he mRNA products (Pfizer & Moderna) would accumulate in ovaries”

These claims are based on a misinterpretation of biodistribution data submitted by Pfizer to Japan’s regulator Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). The researchers injected rats with lipid nanoparticles identical to the ones that enclose the mRNA in the COVID-19 vaccine. The lipid nanoparticles used in the biodistribution study carried a radioactive label. By measuring the level of radioactivity the researchers could estimate how much nanoparticles entered in each tissue and how long it takes for the body to eliminate them.

As Health Feedback explained in an earlier review pages 5 and 6 of the technical document submitted by Pfizer show that the largest concentration of lipid nanoparticles remained at the injection site (52.6% of the administered dose at one hour post-injection) followed by the liver (18.1% at eight hours post-injection). The amount present in the rest of the tissues didn’t exceed 1% of the administered dose and was below 0.1% in most of them. Therefore Thorp’s claim that “the vast majority” of the lipid nanoparticles disperse throughout the body is inaccurate.

Likewise the peak concentration in the ovaries was very low (0.095% at 48 hours post-injection) as Abraham Al-Ahmad an associate professor in pharmacology at Texas Tech University pointed out in a blog post. This concentration might be even lower in human ovaries because the dose of lipid nanoparticles in the COVID-19 vaccine is far lower than that used in the biodistribution study in rats. In an article on the blog Science-Based Medicine David Gorski a professor of surgery at Wayne State University estimated that the dose used in rats would be equivalent to about 18 to 35 times the dose used in humans.

There is also no evidence indicating that these small concentrations of lipid nanoparticles have any negative impact on ovarian function in rats let alone in humans. In fact a small study involving 32 women and published in Human Reproduction found that neither SARS-CoV-2 infection nor vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine impaired ovarian function in humans[12].

Claim 3 (Misleading):

“Women are having bleedings. The doctors in our area are doing hysterectomies in young women like 30-somethings they said ‘Oh it’s not unusual.’ Let me tell you as a board-certified gynecologist that’s very unusual. Women’s periods are messed up all over the place”

In an attempt to further support the false narrative that COVID-19 vaccines impact ovarian function The Epoch Times article quoted gynecologist Christiane Northrup. Northrup has previously spread medical misinformation and was among the six great spreaders of the 2020 conspiracy theory video “Plandemic” which propagated unsupported and inaccurate information about the COVID-19 pandemic according to the New York Times.

Northrup didn’t provide any evidence supporting the claim that vaccinated women undergo hysterectomy more frequently than unvaccinated women. Hysterectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the uterus that is used to treat gynecologic problems such as cancers endometriosis and heavy bleeding. However COVID-19 vaccines haven’t been associated with any of these conditions.

In 2021 many women reported changes in the menstrual cycles after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine including longer heavier or more painful bleeding. But clinical trials generally don’t study this subject and data about the effect of COVID-19 vaccines on women’s menstrual cycles were very scarce.

The first study evaluating the effect of COVID-19 vaccines on menstruation was published in Obstetrics and Gynecology in January 2022[13]. The authors found no difference in the duration of the bleeding before and after vaccination in almost 4000 women. They did find an increase of one day in the menstrual cycle length after vaccination. However such change is within the range expected from natural variations in menstrual cycles and the authors concluded that it doesn’t have any clinical implications.

Claim 4 (Misleading):

“Among the adverse events particularly alarming are the ones that affected pregnant women. The documents say that there were 274 pregnancy adverse events of which 75 or 27 percent were ‘serious.’”

The Epoch Times article referred to a safety surveillance report from the first three months post-authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine including data from 270 pregnant women. This document was part of the Biological License Application and was confidential until the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released it on 1 March 2022 in response to a Freedom of Information Act request.

Since its release Pfizer’s document has been misused to promote the narrative that COVID-19 vaccines are unsafe and associated with multiple medical conditions as this earlier Health Feedback review documented. However the document contains information about adverse event reports which on their own are insufficient to determine whether a vaccine is unsafe as Health Feedback explained in this Insight article.

An adverse event is any health problem that occurred after vaccination regardless of whether the vaccine caused it. This is different from a vaccine side effect which has been established to be caused by the vaccine; one example is an allergic reaction to a vaccine ingredient. In other words adverse event reports contain information about medical events that occurred after vaccination but on their own they cannot establish whether the event was caused by the vaccine.

In addition adverse event reports might not be representative of the situation in the general population due to different types of limitations. For example page 6 of the Pfizer’s document suggests that the number of serious adverse events might be overrepresented as compared to mild adverse events due to limitations in data processing:

“Due to the large numbers of spontaneous adverse event reports received for the product the MAH [marketing authorizations holder] has prioritised the processing of serious cases in order to meet expedited regulatory reporting timelines and ensure these reports are available for signal detection and evaluation activity […] Non-serious cases are processed as soon as possible and no later than 90 days from receipt.”

Given all these limitations claims that the COVID-19 vaccine is unsafe for pregnant women or for the general population based on this document are misleading and unsupported.

Conclusion

Misinformation linking COVID-19 vaccines with pregnancy and fertility problems has been pervasive throughout the pandemic. However such claims have no fundamental basis in scientific evidence. Current evidence from research studies and vaccine safety surveillance shows that COVID-19 vaccines don’t impair fertility and are safe during pregnancy. COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing severe illness and are particularly important for pregnant women who are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant women. COVID-19 also increases the risk of pregnancy complications compared to pregnant women without COVID-19. This means that getting vaccinated would reduce the risk of poor outcomes during pregnancy not increase it.

This is a big recruiting win for the Runnin' Utes as they add a very promising young talent to the mix.

Little announced his commitment via Twitter:

As a 6-foot-4 185 pound guard Little shows the ability to do a bit of everything. He can be the primary ball handler he has a strong handle to go along with good feel for scoring opportunities for himself or others. He can score inside and out and can play off the ball as well. There are a lot of natural playmaking qualities that Little possesses and he's showcased good defensive ones as well. Despite the fact that he saw inconsistent playing time this past season he is still regarded as a four-star transfer prospect.

Utah brought Little in for an official visit this past weekend and were able to make a very good impression. Little is a native of Finland which gives the program valuable relationships in the form of Hanno Mottola Mikael Jantunen and even Lauri Markennan all of whom are connected through the Finland national team.

Little entered the portal after his first and only season with Baylor. The Bears had quite the logjam in the backcourt which led to him looking for a better opportunity elsewhere. Little still showcased his productive potential in games where he got extended playing time.

He is a former top 50 overall prospect and top 10 point guard in the 2023 recruiting class. He committed to Baylor over Indiana and Villanova while also having significant interest from other power programs in college basketball as well. Little earned a 94 four-star rating and No. 9 ranking in 247Sports' 2023 recruiting class.

Little did not play his ""senior year"" of high school at Sunrise Christian Academy but played for the Helsinki Basketball Academy (HBA) in Finland. HBA is a part of the Finland 1st Division basketball league and is essentially a high school program competing against professional players in Finland. Little averaged 21.6 points 9.0 rebounds and 5.8 assists in 20 games in this league during the 2021-22 season.

He joins Utah with three seasons of eligibility and a redshirt remaining. He is the fourth transfer addition and joins Keanu Dawes Mason Madsen and Zach Keller in Utah's transfer portal class. Utah now has five open spots remaining on the roster.

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhcnRhbnN3aXJlLnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9saXN0cy9saXN0LW9mLXNjaG9vbHMtbXN1LXRyYW5zZmVyLXBnLWFqLWhvZ2dhcmQtaXMtcmVwb3J0ZWRseS1jb25zaWRlcmluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,List of schools MSU transfer PG AJ Hoggard is reportedly considering,"Former Michigan State point guard AJ Hoggard has reportedly cut the lists of schools he’s considering to only five programs.

Hoggard has started at point guard for the Spartans the past two seasons recording 10.7 points and 5.2 assists per game this past year. He however elected to enter the transfer portal following the season instead of coming back for a fifth year at Michigan State.

2022 has delivered a blunt reality check to investors. After a massive rally in 2020 and 2021 the S&P 500 is already down 10% in 2022.

According to Peter Schiff CEO and chief global strategist at Euro Pacific Capital the worst is yet to come for investors.

“The US stocks that most people own are the ones that are going to go down the most” Schiff says in a recent interview with Megyn Kelly. “Those are the overpriced momentum-type tech stocks that everybody owns.”

He adds that those kinds of stocks “were inflated during the bubble” and “are going to collapse as the air comes out of that bubble.”

On a positive note Schiff provides several ideas on how investors can prepare for a seemingly inevitable downturn.

Recession-proof businesses

Instead of chasing the exciting high momentum tech names Schiff suggests looking at recession-proof businesses especially if they pay reliable passive income to investors.

He says investors should consider assets that “sell products and services that consumers have to buy not just what they want to buy.”

The reason is simple: With rampant inflation the products that consumers need will become so expensive that they won't have money left to buy the stuff they want.

“You want to own the companies that sell the stuff that people need to buy and they can raise prices and they're paying their earnings to their shareholders in the form of dividends.”

Food and tobacco are good examples according to Schiff.

People need to eat no matter what happens and beyond food companies many sectors support the growing and processing of what ends up on our plates. Meanwhile the demand for cigarettes is highly inelastic meaning large price changes only induce small changes in demand — and that demand is largely immune to economic shocks.

Schiff is putting his money where his mouth is.

According to Euro Pacific’s latest 13F filing its third-largest holding is cigarette giant British American Tobacco (BTI). Its fourth-largest holding is Philip Morris International (PM) another tobacco king.

Both companies pay generous dividends: British American Tobacco yields a whopping 6.8% while Phillip Morris provides an annual yield of 4.8%.

While Schiff doesn’t own huge stakes in food companies the fifth-largest holding at Euro Pacific is fertilizer producer Nutrien (NTR). Nutrien doesn't boast a high dividend yield. But as one of the world’s largest providers of crop inputs and services the company is positioned solidly even if the economy enters a major recession.

You can already see the resilience of these businesses. While the broad market indices have suffered losses in 2022 shares of British American Philip Morris and Nutrien are all up nicely year to date.

Story continues

Precious metals

Raging inflation has brought plenty of attention to precious metals. And the war between Russia and Ukraine gave investors yet another reason to check out the sector.

After all precious metals like gold and silver are known for being safe-haven assets: in times of crisis people hold precious metals to protect their wealth.

Schiff likes gold too. He sees it more as a store of value rather than an investment.

“You hold on to gold to preserve value because it doesn’t throw off a return like stocks or real estate.”

Schiff explains that in 1971 the world went from a gold standard to a fiat standard. The U.S. dollar is the reserve currency for now but with massive money printing and huge trade and budget deficits that status might not hold true for much longer.

“Gold and silver will be big winners in a monetary reset where the dollar is no longer the reserve currency because when the dollar is out gold will be back in.”

You can buy physical gold and silver at your local bullion shop. Large miners provide another way to get exposure: When gold prices go up gold producers tend to enjoy higher revenues and profits.

The two largest holdings at Euro Pacific Asset Management are gold miners: Barrick Gold (GOLD) and Newmont (NEM).

These two companies are delivering solid returns as the yellow metal makes a comeback in 2022. Year to date Barrick Gold and Newmont shares are up an impressive 30% and 26% respectively.

The meet which came shortly after he announced that he would transfer from Florida to Texas for his senior season saw him finish 2nd in the 100 free in 47.61 and win the 100 fly in 50.68. Those times currently rank him as the 24th-fastest and 13th-fastest times in those events respectively all-time.

In high school Rooney swam 1:33.70 at the 2016 North Coast Section Swimming & Diving Championships. That swim broke Tom Shields’ National High School Record in the event and set Rooney up for a lot of expectations as he prepared for his NCAA career at Florida.

After winning just one individual All-America award in his first two seasons at Florida via a 6th-place finish in the 200 free as a freshman his junior year for the Gators was his breakout albeit not in the race for which he was best known. Rooney swam 44.99 in the 100 fly at the 2019 NCAA Championships to finish 4th and it looked like he was finally getting over the hump collegiately.

That momentum carried big-time into the summer. While the U.S. had already chosen their World Championship team for the year Rooney went to the summer-ending Phillips 66 Summer National Championships and marked a statement swim in prelims of the 100 fly of 50.68.

He was over 51 seconds in final but easily beat a field that included name-swimmers like Jack Conger and Jack Saunderson and Ryan Held. Even without going to World Championships he ended that season ranked #2 in the world behind only Caeleb Dressel’s World Record.

That put Rooney into prime position heading into his senior season of collegiate swimming and what was supposed to be an Olympic year. He was well-ahead of the rest of the American field and had a beat on not only a spot at the Olympics but a spot on the Olympic podium in his sights.

Prior to that he was 2nd only to Ryan Held’s career-best swim of 47.39 in the 100 free. Rooney swam a 47.61 for 2nd place which ranked him 5th in the world. The U.S. had five of the top eight swims in the world that season and six of the top ten if we count Tate Jackson (47.88) from the same Nationals meet.

His senior season at Texas was going well including a 44.83 mid-season 100 fly at the Minnesota Invitational that will wind up being his career best. But as we all know by now COVID hit. His last NCAA Championship meet was a bust and the Olympic Trials were pushed off a year and Rooney like most swimmers was left to find a path forward that wasn’t quite to plan.

While Texas wasn’t hit too hard by lockdowns coming out of the pandemic he looked okay going 53.99 at the first 2021 Pro Swim in January and 52.71 later in March.

But he never was able really have that burst again that he showed at the 2019 National Championships. At the Olympic Trials he made the semi-finals of both the 100 free (11th – 48.86) and 100 fly (12th – 52.64) but he didn’t approach those magical 2019 times.

He hovered around similar times throughout the 2021-2022 season and settled with good times (48.75 in the 100 free prelims 52.00 in the 100 fly prelims) at the US Trials with a 3rd-place finish in the 50 fly as his best result (though only the winner gets selected in that event).

While he certainly wasn’t bad coming out of the pandemic he never lifted to the same peak that he did in 2019.

And that was a big part of the story of Rooney’s results in his decorated career. He rose to really high peaks but never summited the mountain that he showed he was capable of.

It would be hard to describe Rooney as “the best swimmer to never make a US Olympic Team” because there are other candidates for that position who sustained the edge of long course glory for longer but he might be the best swimmer to never make a US open-age international team.

Rooney raced at the Junior Pan Pacific Championships in 2016 and the World University Games team in 2017 but never qualified for an open team – in short course or long course.

Based on his peaks I don’t think there are any American men of the last 15 years who have left fans longing for his international long course potential quite as much as Rooney.

Retiring just past his 24th birthday Rooney was at an age where maybe his best times and maybe his first senior US team were still ahead of him. Even leaving the sport at such a young age he left a big impact on the history books of swimming.

Dressel Phelps Rooney Crocker Conger

While the medals of Dressel Phelps and Crocker put them at the top of many very short lists in one specific category Rooney is toe-to-toe.

Among Americans who were elite in both the 100 fly and 100 free Rooney stands behind only Dressel and Phelps.

43 American swimmers in history have best times in the 100 fly + 100 free of under 102 seconds (reference: something better than a 53-second 100 fly and 49-second 100 free). Rooney ranks 3rd all-time among those swimmers.

Internationally only two others have a faster combined result in those races than Rooney. One is Hungarian Kristof Milak who has been 49.68 in the 100 fly and 48.00 in the 100 free which ranks him behind only Dressel and Phelps. Milorad Cavic had bests of 48.15 in the 100 free and 49.95 in the 100 fly which aggregate to 98.10.

While those two both have 49-second 100 meter butterflies to their name neither (yet) has a 47-second 100 fly on their register.

Fastest Swimmers Globally 100 Fly + 100 Free

Caeleb Dressel – 49.45 + 46.96 = 96.41

Michael Phelps – 49.82 + 47.51 = 97.33

Kristof Milak – 48.00 + 49.68 = 97.68

Milorad Cavic – 48.15 + 49.95 = 98.10

Kim LaScola was a high school student seated in a hammock on a plane ordinarily for paratroopers the first time that she really thought she could be an engineer.

LaScola grew up in Pittsburgh where the U.S. Steel Corp. was headquartered. So when they sent an engineering-centric program to her high school it encouraged students like her who had a penchant for math and science to pursue engineering by providing job shadowing opportunities and more.

""I took my first flight through this"" she says. ""They took us to the Pennsylvania International Guard Station and flew...that was really amazing. That's when I started thinking about engineering. I thought 'You could earn a good living and you can have independence.'""

Now Kim Needy is dean of the University of Arkansas College of Engineering a position that she has had since November 2020. She is the first female in the role. One of the many many things that Needy is currently tasked with is finding the next chancellor for the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville since she was named chairperson for the search committee in February.

""I could always count on Kim letting me know how I could be more effective"" says Chancellor Emeritus John A. White Jr. who returned to the engineering faculty soon after Needy became a professor and head of the department of industrial engineering at UA.

""She's an exemplary leader"" he says. ""Therefore I was not surprised when President Bobbitt selected her to chair the search committee for UA's chancellor.""

Last month Needy was honored as an Extraordinary Woman for faculty a designation by the Chancellor's Commission on Women that recognizes someone who is ""a role model and inspiration for others seeking gender equality; who empowers those around them; and makes a positive impact on women's experiences on campus.""

That designation surprises no one close to her as they've either watched her build others up or more often been one of those people themselves.

""Dr. Needy is a very thoughtful caring and hard working leader who is absolutely brilliant at creating an effective team"" says Patricia Koski former dean and associate dean of the Graduate School and International Education at the University of Arkansas. She got to know her when Needy was dean of the graduate school from 2014 to late 2020. Koski says she learned a lot from her which helped when she took over as dean.

""Her goal always is to empower other people"" Koski says. ""Over and over I saw her reach out to people as a mentor to help them achieve their goals. I was amazed that she did this because her own schedule was so packed full.""

Koski counts Needy as a mentor too since she continued to pick her brain as she followed in her footsteps -- a daunting prospect she notes.

""Kim was a very hands-on advisor who guided me through every step of transitioning from a graduate student to an assistant professor in industrial engineering"" says Heather Nachtmann associate dean for research in the UA College of Engineering and one of Needy's former Ph.D. students. ""Through her own actions Kim taught me the value of professional networking and how to be a servant leader ... skills that have enabled me to be successful throughout my own career.""

Kim Petrone met Needy when their sons were in kindergarten together at Root Elementary and says they not only became fast friends and running buddies but campus colleagues too.

""She mentored me as I started a career with the university helping me understand and appreciate academia"" Petrone says. ""I've enjoyed countless hours of running/walking (and) conversation with her. She's a great conversationalist whip-smart empathetic and insightful.""

Needy's impact on campus extends to keeping graduate students on the path to graduation. She established the Needy Family Graduate Student Emergency Fund for students' unexpected expenses that hinder their ability to continue in school.

""There are so many financial burdens that impact their ability to focus in the classroom"" Needy says. ""The surprising thing is that sometimes it's a small amount of money that is the difference maker ... sometimes just a few hundred dollars.""

BASEMENT ACADEMY

Kim LaScola Needy spent her childhood in Pittsburgh as the oldest of her parents' two girls. Since both of her parents were first-born children her mom the first of four girls herself she says she took the responsibility of being the elder very seriously.

Sunday dinners were always spent at grandmother's house with the rest of the family all the aunts and uncles and cousins always together.

""A lot of women influenced me"" Needy says -- especially her grandmother aunts and mother. After her paternal grandmother died grandpa moved in with them. And although they had a small home and a busy life Needy says her parents always made time for her and her sister.

""I always had everything I needed and some of the things I wanted"" she says. ""I always felt like I could do and be whatever I wanted.""

Growing up Needy wanted to be a teacher because that seemed like the biggest influence on a person's life aside from their family members. She would often play school in the basement where Needy would draw on the chalkboard and give assignments to her little sister who was her willing student.

""I have always admired Kim and wanted to be like her; she's always been strong willed independent and generous"" says Kathy Feehan Needy's sister.

Not only was she her first (pretend) academic student Feehan says Kim taught her life lessons early on by handing over a toy if Kathy's was broken. When they each got a quarter for candy Kathy would spend hers on one big thing she could she eat on the way home. Kim however would buy 25 small pieces so that she could share some with Kathy when she inevitably ran out.

""Kim continues to be my role model and hero as I followed her into an engineering degree which was particularly difficult for me with dyslexia"" Feehan says. ""More than anything she taught me that you can do anything you want to do if you put your mind into it. I couldn't ask for a better sister.""

One thing that was instilled in Needy and her sister from an early age was the importance of a college education. Their mother earned a full scholarship to college but due to her father's struggle with MS she needed to help financially support her family. After high school graduation she went to work in the insurance industry and turned each paycheck over to her mother. College was not an option at the time.

Needy's father came from a working class family too. Of her four grandparents her paternal grandfather was the only one to graduate from high school and her father became the first in his family to attend college.

""When dad set off to go to college it was a big deal"" Needy says. He studied electrical engineering but he ran out of money and came up against other issues so he dropped out. Her dad went to work as a technician for the U.S. Bureau of Mines and there he was encouraged to go back to school for his degree. He worked all day and took two classes at night. ""There was no doubt for us -- we were going to college.""

He earned his degree in math and became a research scientist. By high school it was clear that Needy was exceptional in math and science too.

I'M SURE I'LL SEE YOU THERE

When it came to picking a college Needy applied only to the University of Pittsburgh her father's alma mater. She got in -- but the night before her first day of college she didn't sleep. Instead she laid there wondering ""Am I smart enough? Can I do this?""

""I was so excited to be in engineering"" Needy says. ""It was the cream of the crop. I was at the top of my high school and everyone else was too.""

She couldn't afford to live on campus so each morning Needy took a streetcar that stopped half a mile away got a transfer and finally a bus to the university. It evened out to two hours commuting daily.

At first she thought she would study chemical engineering but as she explored the various disciplines she began to gravitate toward industrial engineering.

""I hadn't even heard about it before"" Needy says. Nicknamed ""people engineering"" it touches on so many parts of life and society: healthcare and transportation for example and working to improve it. ""Making it faster cheaper more cost effective -- everybody needs that.""

It was a career with no shortage of need she says. And as she toured companies it opened her eyes to the many possibilities. As Needy became active with the Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers as a student it solidified her choice and gave her confidence.

""I knew Kim LaScola as a very bright student in several of my classes and as a very active leader in the student chapter of the Institute of Industrial Engineers"" says Harvey Wolfe Department of Industrial Engineering chair emeritus at the University of Pittsburgh. Their strong friendship began to form when he drove her and three other students eight hours (one way) to Kalamazoo Mi. for an IIE conference.

Going to that conference was life changing Needy says as she saw industrial engineers from the entire region.

""I thought 'This is my profession. This is what I'm going to do.'""

As Needy considered her job prospects she turned toward PPG Industries. The fact that it was a Fortune 500 company and would allow her to remain in her hometown accounted for a lot. But as graduation approached a little hallway exchange changed everything.

A professor was running past Kim and her friend. They called out ""Hey wait where are you headed?"" He called back that he was going to review graduate school applications and he was certain he'd see both Needy's and her friend's in the stack.

It made Kim realize for the first time that she was capable of graduate school something she hadn't remotely considered yet. And while the salary that PPG Industries was offering her wasn't her highest it did come with reimbursement for college tuition and books.

A WOMAN IN INDUSTRY

Needy joined PPG Industries following college graduation in the summer of 1984. She was a programmer analyst in the coatings and resins division a part of the company that makes paint and she soon began to talk to her manager about that reimbursement program.

""He said 'Oh but you don't want to do that right away; you'll be busy doing this or something else'"" Needy says but she pressed on anyway. ""I said 'But if it is allowed I could start right away right?'""

The graduate program was in the evening so much like her dad she worked days and went to school at night.

""I felt fortunate to work at a Fortune 500 that recognized the importance of diversity. They wanted a woman at the table"" Needy says. She was placed on a task force to implement quality management in her division and said she got other good opportunities as a result. ""It hasn't been until later in my career that I recognized the hurdles and barriers women had because I benefited so greatly from a generation ahead of me.

""It wasn't easy but I came in at the right time.""

She was on a business trip to Milwaukee in late March 1985 when she had her next life changing meeting a chance encounter with Bill Needy who was also there on business.

""What initially attracted me to her in addition to her being attractive was that she was an engineer working on her master's"" Bill Needy says. ""But when she told me she drove a car with a manual transmission and knew how to change her own oil I knew I had to find out more.""

Two weeks later Bill visited Pittsburgh for the first time taking Kim to dinner at an exclusive Mount Washington restaurant with a view of the city below. At least that's what he thought he was doing until she insisted on picking up the check since he had driven 200 miles to be there.

With him living in Columbus Ohio and she in Pittsburgh the two only saw each other on weekends until they were married in July 1986. After Needy finished her master's degree the couple moved to Wichita Kan. where Bill was taking classes. Since he was busy with his education at night Kim thought it might be fun to keep continuing her education at the same time.

In February 1988 she took a job as a systems analyst for The Boeing Company and was the first woman there to be awarded a PhD fellowship.

ENERGIZER BUNNY

After four and a half years of working and earning her doctorate Needy was fully expecting to return to Boeing. But having kept in close contact with her former professors meant she was at the top of their minds.

""When I found out that Kim was getting her Ph.D. from Wichita State I immediately offered her a job at Pitt as an assistant professor"" Wolfe says bringing her back to campus in the fall of 1993. ""I might have bypassed a few rules relative to hiring but I knew I was getting a superb faculty member.""

Wolfe was proven right saying Needy exceeded his highest expectations as a wonderful teacher researcher doctoral advisor and volunteer for many of the extra responsibilities of the department.

When undergraduate students would ask ""Why are we learning this stuff? Will I really ever use this?"" Needy was always ready with answers from her real-life applications. Her devotion to teaching while so many others were more interested in research set her apart. Later on Wolfe nominated her for the prestigious Albert G. Holzman Distinguished Educator Award which she received in 2019.

Needy was happy in her role at the University of Pittsburgh and planned to stay there for the remainder of her career but in 2007 she got a call from the University of Arkansas which was looking for a department head for its industrial engineering department.

Kim immediately said she wasn't interested but the hiring committee was persistent and it intrigued her that the Razorback campus had already attracted three other Pittsburgh Ph.D.s including her former student Heather Nachtmann.

""I encouraged Kim to apply"" Nachtmann says. ""Although I was doubtful she would ever leave her hometown I knew she would be an outstanding department head.""

Needy came to Northwest Arkansas for a visit and was blown away by the people she met on campus -- and she liked that the weather was similar to her hometown's. But what piqued her interest most was knowing that John White was stepping down as chancellor and would be returning to the engineering faculty giving her the opportunity to work with him.

She accepted the job and became department head of UA Industrial Engineering in August 2008. Throughout the move to Arkansas and learning the new job she remained an adjunct professor for the University of Pittsburgh for three more years so she could continue to advise the PhD students she left behind.

""She is the Energizer bunny"" Bill Needy says. ""She is very good at time management but she does work a lot of hours and just never stops until she finally conks out in the evening. It has always worried me but she has been doing it for the 37 years we've been together.""

White says that she actually makes the Energizer bunny seem like a laggard.

""Kim is proof that the cream rises to the top. In practically every organization in which she works she emerges as its leader"" he says. ""Stated simply Kim's a winner. We are most fortunate to have her at the University of Arkansas.""

Now a year and a half into her tenure as dean of the College of Engineering a job she was busy learning during the thick of the pandemic Needy says her primary goal is to help the college grow.

""As we meet alumni and employers and around the state (we hear that) we're not producing enough engineers"" she says. ""We need more and we need to increase the diversity of engineers. If we continue and women or minorities are not coming to the table in greater numbers we have to go deeper.""

Kim LaScola Needy

Date and place of birth: September 29 1962 Pittsburgh

Family: husband Bill Needy sons James Needy 24 Thomas Needy 19

Fantasy dinner party guests: I would love to have dinner with my sister Kathy our mom (who is deceased) and both our grandmothers (who are also deceased). These women have all been so influential in my life and I would love to have a conversation with them.

A typical Saturday night for me includes: My work weeks are long so on Saturday night I enjoy relaxing while watching a good movie reading the newspaper or diving into an interesting book.

The accomplishment I’m most proud of is: raising our two children James and Thomas who are both incredibly smart independent and driven.

People might be surprised to find out I: have run the Pittsburgh Great Race supporting amyloidosis research since its inception in 1977 a total of 35 times and counting

The greatest challenge I’m facing right now: There’s just not enough time to accomplish all that I want to do. This doesn’t deter me however as I work to make the University of Arkansas College of Engineering the premiere engineering college in the region and the destination of choice.

Something I think everyone should try at least once: I think everyone should travel to a foreign country to gain an appreciation of how others live.

The last show I binged on television: “The Golden Girls.”

My favorite type of music: I love to listen to classic rock.

If I were stranded on a deserted island I’d have to have: a satellite telephone.

When I have an hour of free time I call a family member or friend to catch up.

Three words to describe me: energetic steady and loyal.

The impact of several contractor collapses in recent months has highlighted counterparty solvency as a key risk for construction projects. This article discusses the effect of insolvency on existing insurance policies and the extent to which insurance can mitigate counterparty risk.

Insolvency risk in the Australian construction industry

A perfect storm of rising costs supply chain delays and workforce shortages continue to put pressure on construction companies battling the ongoing impact of inflation. According to the latest ASIC data 271 construction companies entered external administration in the quarter ending March 2022 accounting for 25 per cent of all Australian company insolvencies (Source: ASIC)

The impact of counterparty insolvency on insurance policies

The insolvency of an insured is a material event that needs to be advised to insurers. Depending on which party has arranged the insurance the impact will vary.

Contract works insurance

Some contract works policies can contain “cessation of work” restrictions which means cover may cease if a project is inactive for a period of time e.g. while the project owner finds a replacement contractor.

If an insolvency results in a construction site being shut down temporarily the insurers need to be advised immediately and kept up to date with developments to avoid the potential for a loss not to be covered or the policy to be voided.

Owner controlled / Principal arranged insurance

One of the advantages of a principal-arranged insurance policy is that the impact of a contractor insolvency event is typically easier to deal with. Provided that the insurer accepts the replacement contractor and the new contractor accepts the existing policy cover and deductibles the replacement of the insolvent contractor with a new contractor should be straightforward.

Contractor controlled insurance

Where insurance has been arranged by the insolvent contractor the impact is more complex. While project policies cannot be cancelled (provided that the premium has been paid) if the insolvent contractor has used their annual insurance policies to provide the required cover there are few options for replacement contract works cover.

It will be difficult to insure partially completed work with a new insurer and the best approach is to work with the existing insurer to transfer cover.

Where the insolvent contractor has arranged a project policy  provided that the insurer accepts the replacement contractor and this new contractor accepts the existing policy cover and deductibles the new contractor should be added to the existing policy. This may require negotiation with liquidators or receivers but will minimise any restrictions in cover.

 provided that the insurer accepts the replacement contractor and this new contractor accepts the existing policy cover and deductibles the new contractor should be added to the existing policy. This may require negotiation with liquidators or receivers but will minimise any restrictions in cover. Where the insolvent contractor has used their annual contract works policy  existing insurers may be willing to convert the cover under the annual policy into a project policy and continue cover to completion; however this will require negotiation and is likely to need additional premium to be paid. Approaching new contract works insurers can result in significant restrictions to cover relating to any existing defects that have yet to manifest.

 existing insurers may be willing to convert the cover under the annual policy into a project policy and continue cover to completion; however this will require negotiation and is likely to need additional premium to be paid. Approaching new contract works insurers can result in significant restrictions to cover relating to any existing defects that have yet to manifest. Where the insolvent contractor has used their annual public liability policy the new contractor will only need to declare the work under their annual policy.

The insolvent contractor’s professional indemnity insurance will automatically go into run-off i.e. the policy will continue to respond to services and advice provided prior to the liquidation/receivership but not afterwards. The new contractor will need to advise their insurers of the works and extent to which the design is novated to the new contractor and how they are peer reviewing the design.

A project-specific professional indemnity policy may be required if the new contractor doesn’t have an annual professional indemnity policy wants to ring-fence the risk of the project or their annual insurer doesn’t wish to provide cover.

How contractors and developers can mitigate counterparty risk

From a solvency perspective the main counterparty risks relate to certainty of payment and certainty of performance – the principal/employer (or head contractor) wants to be certain that the work will be performed and the head contractor (or subcontractor or supplier) wants to be certain that they will be paid for the work they have performed.",,,,,,

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

The past few years have seen companies like Tesla and General Motors looking to enter the automobile insurance market. These manufacturers see an opportunity to offer insurance to customers because of the amount of data collected from their vehicles.

However Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Warren Buffett said he has no worries about auto manufacturers entering the insurance market. Instead Warren Buffett is more concerned about Progressive's (PGR -0.02%) edge regarding insurance. Here's why.

A two-horse race for the leading auto insurer

GEICO has been around since 1936 but was purchased by Berkshire Hathaway in 1996. According to Forbes GEICO is the fourth-largest auto insurance company with a 9.5% market share. Only State Farm Allstate and Progressive have higher market shares.

However when it comes to future leaders Warren Buffett sees two companies that could become the top auto insurer -- GEICO or Progressive.

Buffett went on to say that ""I have always thought for a very long time [that] Progressive has been very well run. They have an appetite for growth. Sometimes they copy us. Sometimes we copy them. And I think that will be true five years from now ten years from now.""

Risk management is key to running a successful insurance business

Ajit Jain is Berkshire Hathaway's vice chair of Insurance Operations and is on Berkshire Hathaway's board of directors. Jain has a deep knowledge of the insurance business and ran Berkshire's reinsurance business before stepping up to his current position. Jain noted that Progressive had a significant advantage over GEICO with regard to the loss ratio.

The loss ratio is a crucial metric insurance companies use; it's the ratio of losses to premiums earned. This ratio can give you an idea of how much of your earned premiums are used to resolve claims made by clients. Good companies can control losses and keep loss ratios in check. This is something that Progressive has done exceptionally well.

According to Jain Progressive has a 12-point advantage over GEICO when it comes to the loss ratio -- a significant margin in the industry when competition is so high. According to Jain ""There are a number of causes for that but I think the biggest culprit is as far as Geico is concerned...is telematics.""

Progressive has a nearly 10-year head start on this technology

Progressive's telematics or pricing insurance policies based on driving habits is a huge advantage. Progressive was the first in the industry to use telematics when it rolled out the technology in 2010 -- giving it a considerable advantage.

Telematics works like this: Driving data is collected from devices installed on cars or through a cellphone app. This app enables Progressive to collect mileage speed braking time and when you drive during the day.

Progressive can develop personalized rates from this data and give drivers discounts for safe driving. When it comes to pricing models the more data the better. And since Progressive has over 10 years of driver data it has better models to manage risks and keep loss ratios low.

Investor takeaway

GEICO is working to catch up to Progressive. In 2019 the insurer joined other auto insurers that began to use telematics. Jain noted ""My hope is that in the next year or two Geico will be positioned to catch up with Progressive.""

Progressive has an incredible advantage over other insurers because of its built-up knowledge of telematics. As an investor in Progressive it gives me added confidence that this is a stellar stock to hold for the long haul.

Even Charlie Munger vice chair of Berkshire Hathaway admitted ""In the nature of things every once in a while somebody is a little better at something than we are.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUub3JnL2xhdGVzdC93aHkteW91LXNob3VsZG50LWNhcmUtYWJvdXQtZ2FzLXByaWNlcy1tYXNjaW90cmEtMjIwNTA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why You Shouldn't Care About Gas Prices,"The United States has managed to survive the gas prices apocalypse. But we might not make it through the eventual ecological collapse due to the extraction and use of fossil fuels.

Meanwhile politicians and pundits on both sides are still obsessing over the increasing costs that American commuters are paying at the pump. The Biden Administration recently reversed its policy prohibiting new permits for oil drilling on federal land while also tapping into national oil reserves to mitigate potential political fallout from high fuel prices. GOP officials—including Senator Ted Cruz and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis—argue absurdly that rising gas prices prove the folly of Democrats’ environmental proposals even though those proposals have been consistently blocked by Senator Joe Manchin. Evidently the “green new deal” is so powerful that merely mouthing the words can influence the cost of oil in the United States and many other countries also experiencing increases.

Outside of Congress rightwing rage over gas prices has provoked an outbreak of sticker vandalism. Republican voters throughout the country are placing stickers of President Joe Biden pointing and saying “I did that” on fuel pumps. A Pennsylvania man was caught in the act and when asked to remove the sticker became irate and resisted arrest. He now faces charges of criminal mischief harassment and disorderly conduct.

But the panic extends far beyond average Americans armed with stickers. Politico reporters Rachel Bade and Ryan Lizza echoing conventional wisdom among the Beltway commentariat wrote that gas prices “could crush the Democrats” in the 2022 midterms. Fear of political reprisal has also moved local leaders to act including Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot who recently delineated a plan to distribute prepaid gas cards to low-income constituents.

Of course any jump in cost for the poor working class and increasingly squeezed middle class is lamentable particularly in a year of high inflation. But the excessive and outlandish attention placed on gas prices alone—compared to other rising expenses such as rent and health care—exposes a cynical political strategy that prioritizes knee-jerk reactions while refusing to substantively address the more consistent and devastating costs of ordinary American life.

And while gas can eat up to 5 percent of commuters’ monthly budgets in rural states the majority of people in the United States fill their gas tanks only once a week and as a result take less of a hit when prices go up. For residents of major cities who use public transportation the cost of gas is even less relevant.

The costs that transform life into a financial struggle are rarely the subject of forecasts of doom from political prognosticators.

But regardless of a person’s location and transit needs other costs that transform life into a financial struggle are rarely the subject of forecasts of doom from political prognosticators.

Rent for instance is now so high across the country that a full-time worker at minimum wage cannot afford a single bedroom apartment in any state. On the rise for decades the average rent in some cities over the past year alone climbed by an astounding 40 percent. And it’s particularly bad for renters of color who often pay more for rental applications—while getting denied more frequently—than their white counterparts.

Health care premiums for employer-based plans similarly have spiked by 47 percent in the past decade with rates for individual purchasers increasing by similar percentages. Along with larger deductibles and the soaring costs of prescription drugs insurance premiums rarely crop up in the press. Democratic proposals to lower health care costs—including an expansion of Medicare a cap on the price of insulin and increased subsidies for plans available through the Affordable Care Act—consistently fail to pass due to obstruction from Republicans.

In the last two decades the cost of higher education has climbed by a staggering 169 percent shackling millions of graduates with onerous student debt. Various debt forgiveness proposals have gained popularity but annual increases in tuition which have now become alarmingly routine almost never receive media coverage.

The crippling costs of housing health care and education among other necessities such as child care place Americans in a burning house armed only with water balloons. From 1980 to 2020 the purchasing power of average wages to quote one Pew Research study “has barely budged.”

This has predictably fueled the rising level of credit card debt for the average American which now surpasses $6000. Analysts are in almost unanimous agreement that the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate hike will raise interest payments on credit card holders adding yet another largely unmentioned burden to the American household budget.

The “Build Back Better” legislative agenda of Biden and Congressional Democrats included many measures to address the painful cost of living in the United States—such as an extension of the child tax credit subsidized child care and Medicare coverage of dental and vision treatment. As the bill collects dust in a dark corner of the Capitol leading pundits act as if Republican callousness toward working and middle class suffering should have no political consequences.

Fixating on gas prices gives the GOP one more tool to distract the public from their dangerous ambitions.

Worse yet the relentless rage over gas prices provides cover for the Republican Party’s ongoing assault on democracy. Investigations into the January 6 insurrection continue to expose cooperation from high level Republican officials in the House and Senate and in the Trump Administration with the violent mob that attempted to subvert the electoral process and nullify the votes of millions of Americans. Fixating on gas prices in this sense gives the GOP one more tool to distract the public from their dangerous ambitions.

Exaggerating the importance of gas prices without acknowledging the broader economic context of housing health care education debt and wages also shifts political discussion in favor of the poisonous oil and natural gas industries.

Scientists are becoming more desperate in their warnings that humanity is racing toward disaster with its policies of pollution fossil fuel extraction habitat destruction and deforestation.

But if the Legislature doesn’t pass a replacement it’s a clear loss for New York City.

A new analysis by the Citizens Budget Commission confirms those losses include:

Less rental housing construction.

Significantly less affordable-housing development.

And less property-tax revenue for the city.

Supposedly pro-tenant activists and lawmakers won’t admit that absent some incentive like 421-a developers will stop building residential units (except luxury ones) because the default tax rate for new construction is prohibitively high.

They also claim that ending the abatement will free up $1.8 billion in tax revenues. The CBC points out that not only are they wrong but that much current revenue wouldn’t exist without 421-a.

Existing projects will still benefit from the abatements granted before 421-a lapsed so the city will “lose” only about $100 million per year through Fiscal Year 2029 if the program’s not renewed; not until FY 2043 will even $1 billion of the now-foregone revenue be returned to the tax rolls.

Meanwhile CBC reports most development that occurs thanks to 421-a wouldn’t happen. That means the city loses out on the tax take such projects would generate after the abatements expire — as well as on the new housing (both market-rate and affordable) constructed.

So the budget watchdog urges both renewing or replacing 421-a and a broader package of policies to boost housing production such as reducing construction and operating costs increasing as-of-right zoning capacity and reforming the property-tax code.

A sane city tax code wouldn’t make it impossibly expensive to build new non-luxury housing; 421-a is a patch that allows enough construction to prevent Gotham from losing ground. Fixing the entire property-tax code won’t happen this year (or maybe ever); if the Legislature doesn’t replace the abatement now it’s dooming New York to housing decay.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVwLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9vcGluaW9uL2NvbnRyaWJ1dG9ycy8yMDIyLzA1LzA4L2xpYmVyYWwtcHJvZ3Jlc3NpdmUtd29rZS1yaWdodC13aW5nLzk2NzYyNDIwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion: Liberal progressive woke — don't let the right wing taint these words,"Your subscription supports:

The process of restorative justice shifts the focus away from mere punishment and retribution. It brings the victim and the perpetrator together in conversation talking out why the aggrieved was wronged and how the assailant can take accountability before not just the person who was directly harmed but also in some cases before the entire affected community.

Nobody was better positioned to model such a process than Brandy Brooks a racial equity and environmental justice consultant running for an at-large seat on the Montgomery County Council in Maryland. She’s the founder and CEO of Radical Solutions LLC a consulting firm that offers “training coaching and consulting for progressive organizing leaders who are working on multiracial cross-class movement-building electoral and issue campaigns.” The firm’s “focus [is] on supporting and centering the leadership of women and femmes of color.”

On March 14 Brooks learned that she herself was the subject of a complaint of a hostile work environment from a member of her campaign staff. What made the process feel especially difficult — but also resolvable through a restorative justice process — was the source of the complaint: a person she considered a longtime close friend. We’ll call them Sam.

Serving on the County Council is a serious job — its nine members set policy for a county of roughly a million residents — but bordering a city that serves as the world’s power center it is not without being unkind a position that Washington’s power brokers spend much time thinking about. Still it would be a foot in the door for the rising democratic socialist movement in the area positioning Brooks for a future run for county executive a statewide position or even Congress. She was a contender from the start having run previously in 2018. The top four finishers in the Democratic primary go on to win council seats and she fell 1.5 percentage points short or less than 6000 votes of making the cut.

In 2020 as Brooks explored a second campaign for a council seat in the well-to-do suburb of Washington D.C. she naturally turned to her closest friends and family to form a “kitchen cabinet” of advisers. First among them were her sister and mother followed by Sam.

Sam who uses they/them pronouns is like Brandy a fixture of the Montgomery County activist scene. They have worked for local labor unions for years and served on the steering committees of both the MoCo branch of Democratic Socialists of America and the umbrella chapter Metro D.C. DSA. Brandy a tenants rights activist in addition to her work as a racial and environmental justice consultant first met Sam in 2017 and developed a close friendship beginning in 2018. Sam volunteered for Brandy’s 2018 campaign while working professionally for a county executive candidate. (Though they spoke publicly at a widely attended DSA meeting Sam asked the Washington Post not to use their name. The Intercept reached Sam but they declined multiple opportunities to be interviewed and we’re also not publishing their name. Brooks’s recollections are central to this article but The Intercept reviewed all key documents and messages and talked to multiple people who knew them both.)

“They’ve just been really super super close friends and even like playful physical close friends” said one mutual friend of Brandy and Sam who asked to remain anonymous because of the fraught situation.

The Campaign

In December 2021 Sam told Brandy they were excited to fill out the questionnaire for the DSA endorsement. The region’s DSA chapters have quickly built themselves into a political force through the dint of their shoe-leather work on behalf of candidates they support: phone banking door knocking and otherwise putting in crucial volunteer hours in races often decided by just a few thousand votes. Given Sam’s standing in the organization and the fact that Brandy was also a member the endorsement was a slam dunk.

With Sam’s help Brandy put together an unusually broad coalition for a democratic socialist. She earned the backing of the powerful Montgomery County Education Association; CASA Action an immigrant rights group; and Jews United for Justice. The small campaign staff quickly formed a union with Sam serving as shop steward.

Text messages the two exchanged over the years provide a window into the type of witty banter mixed with emotional connection that characterizes so many friendships forged in the political world whether it was rehashing a day trip to the beach at Sandy Point State Park on the Chesapeake Bay or joking about reality TV shows or movies they both watched or gossiping about other local political figures.

Brooks shared years’ worth of the messages with The Intercept on the condition that Sam’s not be reproduced. Tracing them through the years it would be hard for an outside reader to distinguish between when Sam was on the campaign as an unpaid member of the kitchen cabinet (starting in December 2020) a part-time deputy campaign manager (June 2021) and a full-time deputy campaign manager (January 2022). The banter and emotional depth remained roughly the same with ups and downs.

In the fall a plumbing leak kept Brandy out of her home for six weeks and she went through an emotionally rough patch. Sam invited Brandy during that time for a day trip to Sugarloaf Mountain in western Maryland but the day before it Brandy offered Sam an out telling them she was feeling down and was “not going to be engaging or fun company.”

Brandy suggested instead that they just play board games in her hotel. “I’m kind of in that mode where I want to talk with someone else deeply about the hard things in our lives and cry together and hold hands and just be really vulnerable with one another. And I want to respect that might not be your vision of how you want to spend Sunday afternoon” she said in a text that later appeared in the Washington Post.

Sam bowed out and Brandy invited over a female friend for the type of evening she was looking for: tears hand-holding and self-exploration. That Sunday night just after midnight — technically Monday morning — Sam reached back out to start a long conversation about the virtues of wool dryer balls.

Sam later said — to the Washington Post and others — that they understood the request for mutual crying and hand-holding as an unwanted romantic advance. Without invalidating Sam’s perspective a mutual friend said that she had seen Brandy say similar things to people of all genders not meant in a romantic way. “That’s how she interacts with her very close friends and I felt it was really taken out of context” the friend said.

As the head of the campaign she had suggested something inappropriate either way Brandy has since acknowledged. That the relationship was already unprofessional is not in dispute and Sam hadn’t even joined the campaign full-time yet.

That happened in January and the two also talked about a potential job in the event of a victory. “Either I asked or they indicated that they would have an interest in working in my council office and I was like ‘OK what kind of things would you be interested in doing?’ And they talked about doing policy work which is what they were doing on the campaign already. And we talked about the position of chief of staff and we talked a little bit about this and I said ‘Yeah you know I would definitely be interested in exploring this with you. And we should keep talking about this’” Brandy said. “And that was our conversation maybe 15 minutes.”

On January 18 Brandy and Sam talked about how working together full time would affect their friendship with Brandy lamenting they’d be able to spend much less time together socially.

Sam agreed with the concerns and cautioned that they should remember that the campaign was temporary but their friendship would endure Brandy said — a sentiment that is confirmed and repeated in messages they exchanged.

After nearly two years of a pandemic the mood in the campaign office was warm and close people on the campaign told The Intercept and the closeness between Brandy and Sam was often on display. “We would goof around and joke and laugh and make memes and be sarcastic with each other” Brandy said. Sam “had a stuffed animal that we would toss around and play with and they would make faces at me with. And as good friends also do we hugged each other. They gave me back rubs.”

“And then there are also things that in the face of a campaign environment when you’re in that kind of proximity where we would be sitting really close next to each other — and neither of us would move away from that situation.”

On January 24 Brandy and Sam had lunch at a Chipotle in Rockville a check-in that evolved into one of their long discussions that ranged widely from the personal to political to emotional to professional and back again.

“We were talking about being glad that we’re friends with each other and that we can talk and have these deeper conversations. And one of the things that I said is it’s often harder for me to be in emotionally vulnerable relationships because I feel a lot of vulnerability and a lot of anxiety about that. And then I also said I think that’s increased unfortunately in cases where I experience romantic and sexual attraction.”

In context it was clear she was talking about Sam and she instantly wished she could take it back. “I regretted it as immediately as I said it because it wasn’t planned. It was something I blurted out. And I was like ‘Oh my God this is like not the time or place for this conversation.’ And then I kind of tried to shut down that part of the conversation and move on to other stuff because I felt really embarrassed that I had said it.” Brandy asked Sam not to respond and changed the subject.

In hindsight she said giving voice to her feelings flowed from her approach to relationships. “One of the things that I try to do is be really intentional in my friendships and my working relationships. And when there’s an issue or a thing going on to try and name it” she said. “I didn’t know if they knew [my feelings] or not. I think I had a thought that they might especially with some of the kinds of contacts that we both exchanged in the office.”

She never went beyond merely sharing her feelings and never asked Sam out nor otherwise made any physical advance. “I fully knew they were in a relationship with someone else. I wasn’t asking them to not be in that relationship. I wasn’t asking them to be in a relationship with me. I wasn’t asking them to have any kind of sexual contact with me” she said.

As she reflected on their relationship realizing things had crossed a line Brandy told Sam they needed to draw boundaries — that the professional and social blend needed to be filtered out.

They set up time to talk on February 7. “I think maybe we need to consider our relationship more of a comradeship where it’s about the work and we that value each other as organizers and we have so much we want to accomplish in the public realm. Maybe the personal stuff just isn’t the right fit” Brandy recalls telling Sam. They also communicated by text about the same idea.

Sam pushed back Brandy recalled. “They said they didn’t like that binary that they blended friendship and working relationships and didn’t want to separate it.” Indeed blending friendship and working relationships is a central component of progressive organizations such as DSA where happy hours canvassing and phone-banking are all social as well as political activities. Successful community building can hardly be done absent socializing and all successful movements have been cauldrons in which lifelong friendships and other relationships are forged. But they have also been the birthplace of animosities that can last for generations.

A few days later on February 11 Sam responded saying they no longer wanted Brandy to communicate with them outside of work. To Brandy it looked like Sam was wounded by her attempt to draw a boundary and responded by drawing a firmer and brighter one. But Sam also routinely broke it sending memes and other missives to Brandy at off hours. Brandy said she abided by the agreement but said it seemed like Sam was only honoring it when they felt like it.

According to Brandy she told Sam that the firm boundary married with frequent incursions across it felt like a “betrayal of trust” — another phrase that would later appear in the Washington Post. After Sam sent Brandy and Michelle Whittaker Brandy’s sister and campaign manager a goofy meme after 8:00 p.m. one evening Brandy reminded them of the boundary they had drawn. Brooks said Sam apologized and thanked her for the reminder. “I indicated to them that I wasn’t OK with setting this really hard boundary which felt really hard and hurtful to me and then continuing to try and engage me emotionally in a way that felt really good. They were trying to use my emotions but not be in a mutual relationship with me. And so it felt like a betrayal of our friendship.”

More hourslong emotionally fraught conversations followed. In one Brandy talked about her tortured relationship with men or people who present as masculine and Sam told her that suggesting they presented as masculine “wasn’t affirming of their gender identity.” Brandy apologized.

The next day in another long conversation Brandy again said that they needed to stick to professional boundaries. According to Brandy Sam asked two questions. First did she regret hiring them? And second was the chief of staff job still on the table?

To the first Brandy said absolutely not. Sam is a well-regarded and well-connected organizer in Montgomery County and the work they’d done to bring endorsers on board the campaign had helped build the broad-based coalition behind Brandy that was poised to elect the first countywide democratic socialist representative in the contemporary era.

To the second question she recalled saying “I don’t know. It was a question before I think it would be an even bigger question given how difficult these last few weeks have been for us. So it’s something that we would have to really talk about before we made that decision.” This answer has since become central to a public indictment of Brooks who is accused of rescinding a job offer in retaliation for a staff member rejecting her romantic advances. But Brandy said she had never made a firm job offer and also never took it off the table.

“I didn’t say ‘No you can’t have this’” she said. “At no point during this was their current job in jeopardy.”

Hope for a Just Resolution

On March 14 Sam came to Whittaker Brandy’s sister and campaign manager to make a complaint of a hostile work environment. Whittaker asked if they wanted to file a formal complaint and they said no. Whittaker took steps to cease contact between Brandy and Sam and recommended mediation to them both.

They both agreed and the campaign brought on the Conflict Resolution Center of Montgomery County to mediate two sessions. The pair came to an agreement one they both signed which rested on Brandy drafting an “accountability statement” that she would read to her full staff and kitchen cabinet — only after Sam had approved it.

Versions of restorative justice have roots in a variety of Indigenous cultures on multiple continents but in the contemporary era in North America it began percolating around the 1970s. Mediation conversation and accountability are at the core of restorative justice. Progressive institutions meanwhile are badly in need of more effective and more just conflict-resolution mechanisms in an era of increasing hostility and toxicity amid a crisis of mental health. The movement is attempting to reconcile sometimes competing values: On the one hand the abolition of prison and the deconstruction of the carceral state a radical move away from strictly punitive or retributive justice. On the other hand an all-out assault on racism misogyny and other forms of bigotry — a crusade that in its more vulgar form is derided as cancel culture. Restorative justice offers the promise of reconciling those two values while also allowing communities to emerge from conflict and crisis stronger and healthier rather than riven with animosities or left with a feeling that one party was wronged.

Mediation gave both Sam and Brandy a space to share the ways in which they felt they had been harmed by the other and it was a place where Brandy was able to see from the perspective of Sam the way she had put them in an untenable situation by not immediately drawing professional boundaries. Whether those boundaries ought to have been drawn when Sam joined as a kitchen cabinet informal adviser or later when they came on as part-time staff the conclusion was clear: The interactions had been inappropriate and Brandy took responsibility.

It seemed like the kind of thing a sophisticated progressive movement invested in the concept of restorative justice could handle through good-faith mediation.

The sessions helped Brandy craft her statement of accountability. At the second mediation Brandy read a draft of her statement to Sam who told her according to Brandy that it was beyond what they had expected and they accepted it without amendments. The two jointly signed a mediation agreement on March 22 2022. “[Sam] and Brandy Brooks agree to keep mediation discussion and written products confidential except for a limited circle of close advisers” reads the agreement. “[Sam] affirms that the campaign and Brandy Brooks handled this situation in good faith with a clear intention of restorative justice and will not make any further requests of Brandy Brooks or the campaign pertaining to the complaint of March 14.”

She read it aloud to staff on March 26. “Brandy spoke for a grueling 10 minutes about how sorry she was” said one of the roughly nine staffers in the room.

“One person cried. Everyone else who made a comment put it in chat and thanked her for a transparent process. [Sam] then said thank you everyone for coming together and listening to this.”

Brandy shared the statement with me wanting to counter the charges that were circulating about her handling of the situation and it is shared below — minus a bullet that involves Sam’s personnel records and a portion that is deeply private to Brooks the inclusion of which was unnecessary to make its point. “This is a deeply personal document meant to be shared in confidence with my close community” she said. “I’m sharing it now because of how thoroughly the letter and spirit of the mediation agreement has been broken by the other party and to be clear how seriously I took my responsibility to be accountable.”

Over the past 15 months since the end of December 2020 I have been working with friends and colleagues to build out my campaign. One of those colleagues who I consulted and engaged in the process from the outset [Sam] was a non-binary socialist and labor organizer who also lives in the County. [Sam] and I first met each other in 2017 during my first run for office and in 2018 began a personal friendship as well. I invited [Sam] to be part of my Kitchen Cabinet in December 2020 and hired them as a staff in the spring of 2021. On Monday March 14 2022 [Sam] outlined for Michelle documentation of a harmful workplace environment caused by me. Michelle informed me of the issues raised and immediately made arrangements around campaign meetings and work activities so that [Sam] and I had no further contact with one another. It is my understanding that Michelle suggested voluntary mediation to [Sam] as an option for seeking to resolve the situation and that [Sam] consented to voluntary mediation; Michelle also made the same recommendation to me and I accepted. That same day Michelle contacted the Conflict Resolution Center of Montgomery County to handle our mediation. The following agreements resulted from our mediation sessions on March 18 and March 21: Brandy and [Sam] will not communicate without a 3rd party present and will only discuss professional issues for the next 12 months at least.

Brandy Brooks will convene a meeting of her staff and kitchen cabinet at which she will read in full the statement shared with [Sam] in mediation without amendment.

[Sam] if able will attend that meeting.

Brandy Brooks will also be responsible for seeking to ensure all staff and kitchen cabinet attend the original meeting or failing that a follow up meeting with [Sam] notified and in attendance.

Brandy Brooks will share a copy of her statement with [Sam] in pdf format via email with Michelle Whittaker copied.

[Sam] and Brandy Brooks agree to keep mediation discussion and written products confidential except for a limited circle of close advisers.

[Sam] affirms that the campaign and Brandy Brooks handled this situation in good faith with a clear intention of restorative justice and will not make any further requests of Brandy Brooks or the campaign pertaining to the complaint of March 14. Per these agreements and my own desire to pursue a healing process for both [Sam] and myself this statement shares my accountability for the workplace incidents that led [Sam] to experiencing sexual harassment. I made a grave error in not putting an immediate stop to the escalating pattern between [Sam] and me of exchanging physical affection in the workplace. It is clear now and ought to have been manifestly clear to me at the time as a supervisor responsible for the wellbeing of my employees that this behavior should have been halted; it was my responsibility as a supervisor to do so. In addition to creating a damaging pattern between a supervisor and an employee where power dynamics and lack of full consent could not help but to be experienced by [Sam] it was also creating deep emotional confusion and distress for me. Although I was aware of the fact that these interactions were resulting in feelings of romantic and sexual attraction that I did not feel were healthy as well as the fact that I was repeatedly welcoming of these interactions and unwilling to stop them the powerful emotional validation that these interactions provided became an overriding need and I continued to both permit and engage in them. In many aspects of my life I consistently struggle with the belief that I am not good enough — not worth being loved listened to or followed. The extreme public vulnerability of running for office exacerbates these fears; while at surface levels I am able to project a high degree of confidence and sometimes actually believe in myself and my leadership I have not conquered these fears at their root. They most frequently manifest as regular self-doubt with periodic bouts of depression and suicidal ideation but in this case the harm was externalized through my relationship with [Sam]. Beyond our physical interactions [Sam] and I also engaged in deeply personal conversations outside and inside the workplace. These conversations included discussion of our perspectives on childbearing our relationships to our parents and friends and our dating histories and current dating situations. These conversations occurred in personal social contexts on the phone on nights and weekends or while riding public transit together after work; however there were also conversations that occurred as social chat during canvassing events and deeper conversations during mentorship meetings in the office. In particular a conversation on January 24 clearly crossed boundary lines by combining a performance check-in deeply personal conversations held in a highly public setting physical contact and a confession of romantic and sexual feelings; regardless of intent this conversation constituted sexual harassment. It’s impossible to state how deeply I regret these interactions. Reflecting on them grieves me deeply. The actions I both took and failed to take have resulted in the destruction of both a deeply valued professional relationship and a friendship that was important to me and both of those losses are profound. I have expressed my deep regret to [Sam] directly in mediation and I apologize for how I have caused them harm. This experience has led me to understand how clearly and deeply gendered trauma from past familial and other relationships continues to impact me. It’s something that I had recognized as impacting romantic relationships but failed to recognize how it could operate within professional relationships — and especially a supervisory relationship — to create an extremely toxic dynamic. I was also very naïve about how power and privilege dynamics around positional and perceived power age gender identity and expression and sexuality all remain operative in a workplace regardless of how close a friendship existed prior to the employment relationship or how collaborative a work culture we sought to create within the campaign. It’s difficult not to simply respond to all of this with shame and self-loathing. However I believe that shame and self-loathing from a sense of past abandonment due to my perception that I am not worth enough for people to love me are the root of how we got to this situation and resolution requires a different path. To start I acknowledge the seriousness of this trauma and its impacts on me and others and I will take the following actions and precautions: I will refrain from physical contact with staff members with the exception of my mother and sister regardless of any personal relationships we may have outside of the office.

During the remainder of the campaign with the exception of my sister and mother I will not discuss any sensitive personal issues with staff members or with volunteers outside of my Kitchen Cabinet and Sanity Circle.

If I wish to discuss sensitive personal issues pertaining to my emotional or mental health my experience of romantic and sexual relationships my gender trauma or any topic that invites emotional intimacy with any members of my Kitchen Cabinet or my Sanity Circle I need to inform them of the nature of the conversation in advance and ask for their express consent.

I will share this document with my staff active Kitchen Cabinet members and Sanity Circle members. I do not believe that people who have committed sexual harassment are irredeemable or unfit for leadership. Trauma affects each of us in many ways and I believe in trauma-informed practice with the goal of healing and restoration not casting people out of the community. I believe the keys to this are: Creating ways for people to be honest and reflective without shame about the traumas they have experienced and the impacts that those traumas have had and continue to have on themselves and others; Creating restorative justice spaces where people can acknowledge be accountable for and repair harms they have done without fearing that such acknowledgement will automatically result in them being removed from or shunned by their communities (personal or professional); Ongoing community training around trauma-informed and restorative justice practices within communities so that we know how to create and hold these spaces and shift from existing models of retribution and throwing people away. This is what I wish to create and model for myself and for others. It feels particularly important for me because of the way that anti-Blackness operates in our willingness to recognize people’s trauma and support them in navigating it rather than punishing and discarding them. Black people are automatically considered by our society to be dangerous and criminal in their character. This manifests in a wide variety of ways including but not limited to: fearing to raise issues or offer critical feedback to Black people in the workplace; requiring Black people to exhibit perfect behavior in order to be worthy of support and punishing them more severely than others who exhibit damaging behavior; and reducing Black people to their worst moments or faults. Black people are also often treated as if they do not experience harm or pain whether physical or emotional at a severity that may account for either their struggles to show up or their need for support. Additionally when it comes to Black women’s sexuality they are either expected to be asexual carers (the “Mammy” stereotype) or if they display sexuality considered an immoral seductress (the “Jezebel” stereotype). The mere existence of Black women’s bodies and sexuality are regarded as problematic unless they are tightly controlled and only accessed as others deem beneficial to them — regardless of the cost to the woman herself. I name these things because I believe that they both impacted the development of this situation and may impact people’s response to this document and I want us to be honest when that is showing up. These are complex incredibly challenging conversations that are ultimately about us fighting against oppression on multiple fronts. They are not easy and I don’t know how well we will accomplish restorative justice in this case. But I hope that this process offers us all some insight about what our collective liberation can look like.

Shortly afterward Brandy and the campaign began to field calls from people who had endorsed her or others in the progressive community saying they had heard damning stories about her behavior on the campaign specifically that she was offering jobs to staff in exchange for sexual favors and retaliating when the overtures were rejected. Montgomery County’s rumor mill was running wild and Brandy tried to tamp down the speculation.

Sam meanwhile stepped away from the campaign according to campaign sources. Brandy citing personnel rules wouldn’t discuss the departure. “When we first entered mediation I’d hoped we could find a way to continue working together. To not only lose a close friend but also a key staff member was very hard for me personally and for the campaign” Brooks said.

On the night of April 7 a Thursday Brandy’s campaign learned that the local Jews United for Justice chapter was discussing the situation and considering dropping their endorsement. The next day Brandy called her endorsers to let them know as much as she could: There had been a complaint of a hostile workplace environment and it had been resolved in mediation.

On Saturday April 9 Brandy got a call from a member of the Metro D.C. DSA steering committee its leadership body inviting her to join a call on Tuesday April 12 to respond to what they said were disturbing allegations they’d been hearing.

That Monday Brandy did a second reading of her accountability statement to two kitchen cabinet members who had missed the first meeting. Sam was present for that too and told Brandy afterward that the statement was no longer acceptable and more accountability was needed. Brandy said she offered to reenter mediation but Sam told her the only way they’d do so would be if Brandy withdrew completely from the race. It’s an open question what exactly prompted Sam’s change of heart but Brandy calling her endorsers to tamp down the rumor mill may have played a role. Brandy said Sam couched her departure from the campaign not as a demand but simply a necessity. “I’m not asking you to do this I’m just saying this is the only way” was the posture according to Brandy.

Dropping out Brandy responded was not an option for a number of reasons including her faith that her campaign was best positioned to serve the million people of Montgomery County she would represent. Beyond that the campaign was publicly financed to the tune of $175000 from local taxpayers. Ending the campaign early would mean Brandy would be personally on the hook for that amount plus interest.

A Show Trial

Brooks was told on Tuesday evening at the Metro DC DSA steering committee meeting that the committee would be voting soon on whether to recommend its membership unendorse her campaign and would halt work on her behalf for the time being. The committee told her it was aware of evidence that she had confessed to sexual harassment — presumably a reference to her accountability statement — and Brooks again took responsibility for what she had done but denied actively seeking sex or retaliating in any way. Losing their ground support would be hard Brooks knew and a public denunciation would be difficult to overcome. “Out of respect for the privacy of those who informed us and in accordance with mediated agreements we cannot provide additional detail but want to affirm that the evidence gave us significant concern” a statement Metro DC DSA would release on April 14 explained.

On Wednesday DSA convened a meeting of other local progressive organizations — including Jews United for Justice and CASA Action the immigrant rights group among others — which some of those who attended saw as an attempt to organize a mass rescinding of the endorsement. “The purpose of the meeting was to inform our coalition partners that we were beginning our unendorsement process and explaining what that looked like as a membership organization. It was not to get everyone on board with unendorsing at the same time as Metro DC DSA had not yet made that decision” said Carl Roberts a spokesperson for Metro D.C. DSA.

Brooks’s campaign posted a statement Wednesday afternoon saying that “increasingly inaccurate and malicious reports of my behavior are spreading within our community” a reference to rumors that Brandy was attempting to trade job offers for sexual favors.

The next day DSA members put forward a resolution to unendorse Brooks arguing that the only way for her to be held accountable was for her to end her campaign. “Whereas” reads the resolution “evidence has been brought forward that while an internal campaign mediation process was undertaken in an attempt to seek accountability from the candidate for the harm caused the outcomes of the process were insufficient and it is our belief that true accountability cannot occur amidst an ongoing campaign for office.”

A steering committee meeting was held that evening to discuss the resolution. Sam spoke at the steering committee meeting laying out the allegations. One attendee asked by chat if Brandy as a long-serving DSA member was entitled to due process. “Endorsement is a privilege not a right of membership” a steering committee member said in response. Brandy was not so privileged.

From the time DSA’s steering committee met with Brandy and the time that members supported by the steering committee put forward a resolution calling for her to end her campaign two days had elapsed.

Much of the public condemnation of Brooks was organized around the straightforward power dynamic at work between a boss and an employee. While the dynamic was painted as black and white in this instance in others the left has been able to construct increasingly sophisticated power maps that get at the gradations of power differentials at play in different relationships. Race and gender are significant factors yet there’s no evidence DSA examined the potential for implicit bias at work against Brandy or in the favor of Sam.

“We’re disappointed to now see her twist the language of abolition and restorative justice to try to deflect from her actions” DSA’s public statement read.

“My work to be vulnerable and accountable and transparent and show up the way that we want our leaders to show up absolutely got weaponized” Brooks said.

While it’s true Brandy was Sam’s employer and admitted to creating a hostile workplace for them the power dynamics aren’t as straightforward as a rigorous boss-employee analysis would conclude. If power is considered to be held by the person who can destroy and therefore exert control over the other without harming themselves the well-connected senior staffer on a short-term campaign for a relatively unknown candidate holds significant power. As the liaison between the campaign and outside endorsers and as a high-level activist in both the Montgomery County branch and the larger Metro DC DSA chapter Sam held in their hands the power to control the narrative around what happened likely dooming the campaign and to heavily influence Brandy’s personal and professional reputation in the long run. Sam would have known that as a Black woman Brandy would face a much more hostile public as she attempted to move forward from any scandal. And while Brandy indeed held employment sway over Sam through the primary on July 19 or through the general election in November Sam given their relationships quickly landed a new job.

That the dynamic between the two on the campaign was inappropriate isn’t in dispute. But in real-time and in hindsight it seemed like the kind of thing a sophisticated progressive movement invested in the concept of restorative justice could handle through good-faith mediation. Indeed if something like this can’t be resolved through such a process what can? Instead Brooks’s agreement to enter mediation became the very evidence against her and formed the foundation of the DSA’s resolution for unendorsement. “I cannot emphasize enough that Brandy Brooks admitted to sexually harassing her employee in a meeting before her entire staff. Those facts are not in dispute” posted one DSA member who co-sponsored the resolution on Twitter.

“My work to be vulnerable and accountable and transparent and show up the way that we want our leaders to show up absolutely got weaponized” Brooks said. “There’s a lot here that has to do with how we weaponize Black women’s emotions and bodies all the time. And when I think about why it’s so hard for women and people of color for Black women in particular to decide to step into these leadership spaces it’s this. This claim is being made that for six months someone was in a nonconsensual social relationship with me. And what that claim implies is that not only am I responsible for any actions that I took but that I’m responsible for every call and text and action and touch that they made. Because I somehow forced them to do it. And it made me think about the stereotypes these cultural stereotypes that we have about Black women and there’s this way that I’m being cast as this Jezebel with voodoo power to compel people to take actions that they don’t that they aren’t in control of and don’t have responsibility for. And it’s such a combination of terrible awful stereotypes that are weaponized against Black women that it almost takes my breath away.”

Enter the Washington Post

The next day the Washington Post entered the fray with a story by Rebecca Tan a former Vox writer headlined “Brandy Brooks pauses campaign amid sexual harassment allegations.”

The story was immediately devastating to Brooks’s campaign. In fact only one allegation had been leveled:

Brandy H.M. Brooks a progressive activist running for Montgomery County Council is taking a two-week break from her campaign amid allegations that she sexually harassed a member of her campaign staff. She said she behaved inappropriately with an employee but denied perpetuating a “pattern of sexual harassment.” She says she does not plan to withdraw from the election. Brooks 45 said she told a full-time paid member of her campaign staff that she had a “romantic and sexual attraction” to them in January adding at the time that she did not want them to respond because she wasn’t ready to be rejected. The now former employee who is 27 and uses they/them pronouns said Brooks’s behavior continued for months and that Brooks eventually told them that she did not know if they could continue working together though she had earlier indicated that if elected she would consider them for her chief of staff. … “For her to say there’s no pattern is completely false” said the former employee. “This was a pattern of abuse and manipulation that centered about sexual harassment.”

The Post had interviewed Brooks and had access to her accountability statement and the mediation agreement showing Sam had initially found the agreement acceptable. In survivor justice circles a “pattern of sexual harassment” is understood to mean multiple accusers though only one was quoted anonymously in the article. (In insisting on a “pattern” Sam quoted in the Post accuses Brandy of a pattern of behavior toward them not a pattern toward multiple people.)

The Post which leaned heavily into their age differential of 45 and 27 including it in the second paragraph referenced Brandy’s text in October while Sam was part-time offering to cancel the Sugarloaf trip if Sam wasn’t in the mood for an overly emotional day. Readers of the Post would no doubt have found the text disturbing out of the context of their yearslong close relationship evidence the Post referenced only fleetingly writing “The former employee had been friends with Brooks since 2018 and was among the first people she asked to join her campaign last year.”

The article embedded DSA’s full statement against Brandy and made multiple references to power dynamics while omitting the reality that Sam was a longtime figure in both the MoCo DSA branch and the regional umbrella. Instead DSA’s response was presented as merely the concerns of those committed to social justice.

The Post also made much of Sam’s claim that losing the chief of staff job amounted to retaliation. But Brandy thoroughly denied rescinding the offer. There had never been a firm offer merely the willingness to entertain the possibility. When approached by Sam again she had continued to insist that it remained a possibility if a more distant one. The accountability statement that Sam signed off on as more than sufficient included no reference whatsoever to retaliation.

“When we entered mediation I had hoped one of the outcomes would be finding a way for us to continue working together” she said.

At a public DSA member meeting on April 21 Sam spoke again thanking everyone for their support and noted that even “elected officials” had reached out to support them. “[Sam] has hated all the elected officials forever. That was the first time [Sam] has ever spoken positively about them” said one DSA member a supporter of Brandy’s who joined the call. “There’s a reason they’re reaching out to [Sam]. They’re running for office.”

One member noting that he had done employment law previously said that he was concerned about the process and wanted more evidence in order to make a decision. He was cut off. “How dare you ask who the aggrieved person is?” a former Brandy staffer and ally of Sam’s cut in. “The evidence is all there in the Washington Post article.”

Nobody spoke on Brandy’s behalf.

On April 25 the Post weighed in again: “Brandy Brooks says she has no plans to withdraw Montgomery council bid.” This time the Post called organizations and prominent people who had endorsed her and asked if they would be distancing themselves. The Post even pressured a renters group she’s part of though the group told the Post they weren’t weighing in:

Brooks a longtime tenant continues to serve as a board member at the Montgomery County Renters Alliance executive director Matt Losak said. The harassment allegations he added are “an issue between her and her campaign.”

The Post also referenced the mediation agreement. “Brooks in turn has accused the employee of violating the terms of a mediation agreement that they both signed earlier this year. (They said they have not.)” the paper reported.

On the night of April 25 DSA’s vote concluded and the chapter overwhelmingly moved to unendorse Brooks saying in a statement:

The vote followed multiple internal discussions in the chapter that began after the Steering Committee was notified on April 9 of credible allegations of sexual harassment and retaliation by Brandy Brooks towards one of her former campaign employees. We were also informed that Brandy walked back the accountability process that the campaign had internally set up. The Steering Committee met with Brandy Brooks on April 12 where she did not deny the allegations. Following this meeting a Washington Post article was released on April 15 where Brandy is quoted confirming the allegations of sexual harassment and professional retaliation against the aggrieved party including the rescinding of a job offer.

Those claims are either contested or untrue. Mediation documents show the process was completed to the satisfaction of both parties. Brooks did not “confirm the allegation” of “professional retaliation” in the Washington Post and continues to deny the charge. If DSA has evidence to the contrary the organization has not presented it.

Jews United for Justice has suspended its campaigning for Brooks and the local teachers union which had endorsed Brooks unendorsed her this week. CASA Action rescinded its endorsement. DSA has never explained how “Brandy walked back the accountability process” nor has it presented evidence to back up the vague claim.

The campaign against Brandy continues. On April 26 a local activist emailed Sam’s defunct campaign account which automatically forwarded the missive to the main campaign inbox. “If you get a sec could you give me a call?” the activist asked. “Just want to get straight on future options vis-a-vis Brandy.”

Future options for Brandy at the moment appear increasingly foreclosed as the public condemnation has not just hampered what looked to be a front-running campaign but has badly damaged other areas of her professional and personal life. What future options Sam is considering against Brandy remain unclear. “What exactly is the definition of ‘accountability’ and ‘restorative justice’ that such efforts would be based on?” Brandy wondered.

DSA declined to comment referring instead to its public statement announcing the unendorsement. “We are proud to be part of such a strong democratic organization” the statement reads “with clear processes for both endorsement and the revocation of endorsement.”

Update: May 17 2022

After publication Sam agreed to share their side of the story and connected The Intercept with Marcus Vessels a canvas fellow on the campaign. Sam said that Brandy’s focus on the conversation in Chipotle when she shared her feelings obscured Sam’s larger objection which was to the way Sam felt treated when they laid out boundaries in February. “That [Chipotle conversation] in itself is not a huge deal to me because you know people have feelings — it’s what we do with those feelings how we work professionally. It was in February that I started to feel pressure and I set boundaries around conversations and felt bullied and retaliated against for setting those boundaries” Sam said.

Brooks had said that she couldn’t remember who initiated the conversation about a future job for Sam but Sam said they recalled that she had prompted it saying “I’ve been thinking of you as chief of staff you’re someone who shares my values. I trust you we work well together.” The offer felt like a strong one to Sam. “I will say that her memory on this either is very patchy or she’s trying to backfill her own narrative” Sam said.

On the question of how the situation went from resolved-through-mediation to torpedoing Brooks’s campaign Sam described two separate tracks.

Sam had signed a written mediation agreement affirming they would “not make any further requests of Brandy Brooks or the campaign pertaining to the complaint of March 14.” That pledge Sam said was meant narrowly to refer to workplace remedies and did not mean that they were OK with Brooks’s campaign going forward. “That’s saying that I’m not going to file suit against her. I’m not going to grieve. … I’m not going to file an EEO or Human Rights Office complaint against her. I’m not going to take any of the workplace processes that we have in place. I think she now is trying to interpret that retrospectively” Sam said. “This was in lieu of a grievance. This wasn’t in lieu of accountability and I guess that might be a philosophical difference [with Brandy].”

Sam said that Brooks told them it was important to keep the situation from leaking to the public otherwise it would end her campaign. “She said ‘This is something that can’t get out.’ And I said ‘All right fine but you have to tell at least your closest supporters and advisers so that they can make their own decision. And we were in an OK place there; it could have gone either way. But then staff started asking me for more information about what happened. And I had very specifically said I reserve my right to talk about the working conditions and the cause of my departure. That’s one thing I will not compromise on” Sam said.

Brooks flatly rejected that characterization saying she sought an assurance from them that they were comfortable with her remaining in the race. “Sam and I specifically talked in mediation about whether or not they were asking me to end the campaign. In our first mediation session I asked them to take time before the next session to deeply reflect on what they wanted so that we could talk honestly about what they felt they needed and what I could agree to with them” she said. “And I said very directly and clearly that it was because I wanted to be sure that the agreement we emerged with truly represented the ask they wanted to make regarding repair and that there wasn’t going to be a surprise ask later that we hadn’t talked about and negotiated.”

Brooks said Sam spoke to the question directly. “They stated clearly that they were not looking for me to end my campaign because that wasn’t the kind of resolution they believed matched their own values around restorative justice” Brooks said.

Sam said that whether Brooks continued her campaign was “outside the scope” of the mediation and Sam wanted to be clear that she should make her own decision on whether to step down. “She asked ‘Are you asking me to drop out?’ That’s a different question. There’s a subtle difference there but it’s two different questions: Are you asking-slash-telling me to drop out? Versus what she told you ‘Does this solve everything?’ Those are two completely different conversations. At no point did I ask her to end her campaign. I didn’t really want to be in the position of asking her to do that. I wanted her to talk with staff and advisers about what she should do next” Sam said. “I didn’t want to be in the position during mediation of talking about what’s going to happen with her campaign. I’m just trying to get out of the situation.”

The second track Sam pointed to that led to the derailment came from the conversations staff had separately with both Brooks and Sam after mediation and after the first reading of the accountability statement. Marcus Vessels approached Brandy to talk saying that he had observed Sam and Brandy in the office together and he felt like they had both crossed professional lines Brooks said adding that she thanked Vessels for noticing that. Marcus relayed the conversation to Sam. “Marcus asked me ‘Did you lead her on?’ And I’m like ‘What?’” Sam recalled. “Marcus asked her ‘Was it two-sided?’ And she didn’t correct him.” That to Sam constituted walking back the mediation while Brooks contends she had always maintained it was two-sided including in her statement of accountability.

Vessels said he sided with Sam over Brooks on that question. “I can believe that Brandy went on retaliation” Vessels said arguing that if she took accountability for harassment she should also take accountability for what Sam felt was retaliation. “What she started to do was backtrack on the accountability meeting” Vessels said. “What I told her was … You can’t sit there and say OK I agree that I did these things read your accountability letter then when the pressure starts getting too hot you start now backtracking and panicking and start saying you’re being thrown under the bus.”

The main beneficiary politically of the implosion of Brooks’s campaign has been Tom Hucker a county councilmember who was running for county executive. The same week that DSA issued its public statement denouncing Brooks followed by the Washington Post article Hucker abruptly dropped out of the race for county executive and just before the filing deadline launched a campaign for an at-large County Council seat instead. Vessels is now working for Hucker.

Correction: May 8 2022 4:16 p.m.

This story has been updated to clarify the unendorsement process by DSA. The story originally referred to Montgomery County DSA as a chapter — it is a branch of Metro DC DSA. And it initially said that five days had elapsed between the time DSA steering committee first reached out to Brooks and when it called for her to drop out of the campaign. To be clear the steering committee first called Brooks on Sunday met with her on Tuesday and by Thursday had joined members in recommending a resolution of unendorsement that insisted she end her campaign. A full chapter vote started the following week."

She was wrong.

Ms. Alvarez 46 and her husband Rafael Landestoy recently booked a flight on a 10-person pressurized capsule that — attached to a massive helium-filled balloon — will gently float to 100000 feet while passengers sip champagne and recline in ergonomic chairs.

But don’t don your spacesuit just yet. While the financial services company UBS estimates the space travel market will be worth $3 billion by 2030 the Federal Aviation Administration has yet to approve most out-of-this-world trips and construction has not started on the first space hotel.

These People Are Out To Stop Him.,"Manny Villar a billioniare is behind an effort to privatize water supplies throughout the Philippines with the company Primewater Incoporated. Citizens unions and political leaders are organizing against it.

City councilor Wilson “Jun” Gamboa Jr. is running for vice-mayor in his hometown of Bacolod City. He is the only candidate on the town’s independent ticket. He is up against the Grupo Progreso slate headed by sitting Mayor Evelio Leonardia. By the estimates of Gamboa’s office Leonardia has access to billions of pesos for his election-related expenses. He is by all accounts a traditional patron-client style politician. Gamboa calls Leonardia a “warlord.”

Among the central issues raised by Gamboa is the city’s water supply. In November 2020 Primewater Incorporated took over the Bacolod City Water District (BACIWA) overhauling the city’s water supply as a public utility. By New Year’s Day 2021 59 regular unionized employees and one non-union worker were laid off and barred from entering the premises.

Since Primewater entered an unsavory turbidity has appeared in the city’s water supply. Water charges have gone up. And what was once a free-flowing supply through the public’s faucets has now become marred by interruptions and inconsistencies.

“I have to fill up drums of water in the morning before 4:00 a.m. because by that time the mud starts to seep through. In the mornings it’s as if coffee is coming through our faucets not water” Berlita Ante a leader of neighborhood associations in the Bacolod slums told The News Lens International.

“Then I have to let the faucet run for at least 45 minutes sometimes longer before what comes out of it is somewhat clear and usable. That’s why our bills are soaring. At multiple times in the day you’d have to just leave the faucet running to get rid of the dirt inside the pipes” she added.

BACIWA is a top-rated water district that earns over 100 million pesos in annual net income. Gamboa’s campaign hinges on a call to reverse the Joint-Venture Agreement (JVA) between the city and Primewater that allowed the corporation to take hold of and profit from the city’s water. Leonardia was one of the primary instruments of the deal that was cemented in November 2020.

During his term in the city council Gamboa penned four resolutions urging local and national officials to review the JVA. He says the appeals have fallen on deaf ears within the bureaucracy. “All profits are collected by Primewater. Local governments get practically nothing. They call it a ‘joint-venture’ but in reality it is privatization” he said.

Other private companies have entered into JVAs with water districts with profit sharing arrangements. But Primewater deals leave the water district with only a function to monitor and a minimal staff of up to 25 personnel only.

Alongside Gamboa are the BACIWA Employees Union (BEU) and other consumer groups. Their adversary Primewater is owned by the country’s richest man Manny Villar. He has access to vast financial and political resources. He leads the Nacionalista Party in mainstream politics his wife Cynthia is a Senator his son Paolo runs the water company and another son Mark was head of the Department of Public Works and Highways for most of President Rodrigo Duterte’s term and is now running for a seat in the senate himself.

But one might say that Gamboa inherited the battle for safeguarding public utilities. “It’s in my blood I guess” he muses. His father Attorney Wilson Gamboa Sr. won a landmark case against the takeover of major Philippine telecommunications company PLDT by foreign entities. “Water and power are also public utilities and they should remain with the Filipino people. If we hand it over or sell out it becomes for profit above everything else. That is the trend now public utilities are eaten up by big companies including multinationals. It’s a question of national patrimony because these utilities are imbued with public interest and general welfare” said Gamboa.

Amlig Tubig - Bacolod Protesters against the JVA between the Bacolod City Water District and Primewater in Bacolod City May 6 2022.

Ahead of the JVA signing Gamboa also led the “filing of a case at the regional trial court in October 2020 for the nullification of the JVA citing that it is highly disadvantageous and onerous. We lost that case so we elevated it to the court of appeals. Last March the appeals court finally asked us to file a follow up brief. That’s a good sign and we hope to take this to the Supreme Court.”

The scope of Primewater is much broader than managing the waters of a single city. Primewater is the fastest growing water company in the country. Prior to Duterte’s presidency and appointment of Mark Villar the company only held contracts with 13 water districts acquired over a decade. Since the start of both of their terms in 2016 a tally by the citizen’s group Water for the People Network and Water System Employees Response (WATER) shows that the company had assumed control over 85 out of 584 water districts. They estimate that there are hundreds of applications for JVAs all over the country to be processed in due time.

The BEU is the only group of water district employees actively resisting privatization by Primewater. And Gamboa explains “Unfortunately I am the only current public official against the takeover.” Both hope to stand in Primewater’s way.

Union Dues

The BACIWA Employees Union has been vocal against the deal. When it was approved employees were offered two choices: assimilation by Primewater with fewer work benefits than before or an early retirement package. 60 employees under the BEU sought a third option to remain in government service according to Benjie Oray BEU Vice-President. In other words a total rejection of the privatization. “That led the Board of Directors to file a resolution terminating our employment and declaring our position as redundant since January 1 2021” Oray said.

Oray remembers his final days of employment in the last months of 2020 when the Primewater deal was being finalized. He’d clock in lounge about the office looking for a place to pass the time while brooding throughout his entire shift. He used to be the executive assistant to the General Manager.

He disclosed that his former boss and BACIWA General Manager Atty Juliana Carbon refused to approve the JVA. From what Oray observed the other members of the Board were in favor of JVA as well as the mayor Evelio Leonardia. And so Carbon “was forced to exit her job because she was pressured out of it. Other members of the board were prepared to take her to court on a myriad of lawsuits. With Mayor Leonardia the Board replaced her with engineer Michael Soliva who is basically the Mayor’s puppet.” Carbon left her post in November 2020. Within the month Soliva signed the JVA. (The mayor is a member of Villar’s Nacionalista Party.)

The BEU surmises that Senator Cynthia Villar also head of the senate committee on public utilities “scratched the Mayor’s back” who in return worked for the passage of the JVA with the Board of Directors.

But the BEU is not down and out. Barring any sudden lockdown restrictions they troop to the BACIWA offices every month sometimes every week in protest of the worsening services and the illegal termination of unionized regular workers.

BEU chairperson Leny Espina said “Last February Primewater added a 12% value added tax to the rates further spiking water bills. But services are getting worse. Everyone needs to let their faucet run for a certain amount of time just to get the dirt out. Some places lose water connections for at least five hours a day. My home has no water from 9:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.”

The union filed a case with the Civil Service Commission (CSC) on the month of their dismissal and in August 2021 the regional CSC office declared that all 60 employees be reinstated with full back pay. This order was appealed by the Board of Directors. The matter is now set to be taken up by the CSC’s national office.

The regional CSC decision is a breakthrough victory for the union. But the year spent without work has taken a toll on employees.

Water Mafia

Even Calajate an engineer speaks with pride about his 18 years of service to the water district of San Jose Del Monte in the province of Bulacan. He spent that time as director of the board and 14 of those years as chairman. When he began in 1989 about 1300 households were connected to the public pipe system. By his last year in 2006 72000 households had access to public water. In the same year the Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) the state body managing water districts recognized Calajate’s office as an Outstanding Water District in the country.

Calajate is now 72 years old and would much rather spend time gardening and growing mangoes. But often he is still consulted by past and present employees. Since Primewater came to his town he has been called into action with increasing regularity.

He first encountered the Villars in the early 2000s when the family was keen to strike a deal for water access. Manny Villar has numerous subdivision projects built on San Jose Del Monte land. Calajate remembers that “he wanted us to shoulder the cost for transmission pipes from our end going to his subdivision projects. But we said that as a wholly private endeavor his company has to come up with his own water supply. The trouble is that costs extra. They’d need to find a source run a deep well and possibly a small treatment facility if the water source was found to have an unsafe mineral content.”

Fast forward to 2016 and Florida Robes Congresswoman to Calajate’s town took to the floor of the House of Representatives lamenting the “water crisis” plaguing her constituents. She hinted that a privately managed concessionaire would do much better without the red tape. This puzzled Calajate. Their water district to his knowledge was in great shape financially with 187 million pesos of revenue in particular that year. He had already recommended a reduction of water charges because as he said “We’d already built three treatment plants at the time. We had some savings for emergencies. And we are a public utility not a for-profit institution. Some of what we earn should go back to the people.”

Despite this Congresswoman Robes and her husband Mayor Arthur Robes maintained their position. (Calajate witnessed the couple having Senator Cynthia Villar as godmother to their marriage.) On March 28 2017 a purportedly unsolicited proposal from Primewater for the “Financing Rehabilitation Improvement Expansion Operation Maintenance at Septage System of the Water District” arrived at the local government offices. Calajate had friendly relations with the mayor and went to his office to demand an explanation. Mayor Robes gave a retelling of his wife’s speech. The mayor’s account was not in keeping with the facts Calajate knew of the water district’s situation.

The old engineer assembled neighborhood groups and civil society forces. By October 2 of that year the newly launched Alliance for Consumer Protection (APC) was holding a protest march against the entry of Primewater.

Four days later a major city water tank exploded killing four people and injuring 44. According to news reports by local media  the maintenance personnel said the seven year old water tank was well-maintained and could have been used for another 50 years. The tank wasn’t pressurized either which meant that it could not have exploded on its own thus amplifying suspicions around the incident.

In any case it gave impetus for both the Mayor-Congresswoman tandem to wage their crusade against the city’s supposed water crisis. And on May 16 2018 Primewater announced its JVA with the water district was now in effect. “It was like waking up to a nightmare” said Calajate.

A familiar pattern followed: murky unreliable water higher charges and layoffs for employees.

“What hurts more is that the people in this town strived to keep that water district running smoothly. We built that from nothing and the Villars just come in and take everything” Calajate said.

The APC filed cases in court against Primewater and complaints at the Ombudsman without any luck.

Reggie Vallejos Development studies professor at the University of the Philippines and Water for the People spokesman likens the dealings of the Villar family to that of a syndicate. He says they use their political and business power to bully people into getting their way. “These are not joint ventures nor takeovers. They’re handovers to the mob.”

LWUA administrator Jeci Lapus publicly stated in March 2021 that Primewater’s dealings should be deemed illegal for misrepresentation. The agreement purports to be an equal investment and sharing of returns but the reality is only the company benefits. “Joint ventures are a good idea but the implementation should be correct. The definition of a JVA should be a pooling of resources not pulling one’s leg” he said.

The LWUA answers to Mark Villar’s office. Lapus shared that in the past he had asked for financial statements of water districts but he was told they don’t answer to him anymore by the Office of The Government Corporate Counsel nor did the Villar-headed DPWH intervene to support Lapus’ challenge. Lapus surmised that the JVA was designed to keep water districts as a public entity in name avoiding certain taxes and an audit by the state while its management and profits were privately accumulated. He planned to submit a position paper to both the DPWH and OGCC but he passed away in July 2021 of Covid-19.

Gamboa the BEU Calajate and Vallejos agree that Mark Villar has used the DPWH to accelerate the growth of his family’s business and keep offices like the LWUA quiet by not entertaining queries into his private dealings. Primewater pops up whenever there is either a Villar business in the area like a subdivision or any DPWH construction that needs a water supply. For Vallejos Primewater’s behavior suggests that it only goes after water districts when it is assured of a profit.

“It’s true that a lot of water districts are in need of structural adjustments and troubleshooting. But if they say the private sector can jump in to help then why is Primewater only targeting efficient and profitable water districts? It’s troubling to see a single entity creeping its way towards acquisition and aided by oligarchic and state powers” Vallejos said.

Much of Primewater’s fate might be decided this year. At the time of writing pre-election day results can swing in either side’s favor. If Gamboa wins his post it could turn the tide against water privatization. Likewise if the BEU receives another favorable decision it could derail any similar moves of the company in the future. Both the Supreme Court and the CSC National Office await them. Although if Mark Villar wins in the senate the fight could turn much more challenging. Whatever the outcome Gamboa and the BEU the David to Primewater’s Goliath are showing no signs of slowing down. They want to put an end to Primewater’s appropriation of their waters.

The report showed most Kenyans prefer using buses minibuses vans motorcycles (boda boda) bicycles and tricycles (tuk-tuk) as their mode of transport to various destinations.

According to the 2021 Economic Survey the number of registered minibuses/matatus declined by 43.9% from 1932 units in 2019 to 1084 units in 2020 attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic which limited travelling.

However on Monday August 9 the Transport Ministry allowed matatus to begin operating at full passenger capacity in strict adherence to COVID-19 protocols.

A Wisconsin woman has gone to court to stop the sale of a long-lost piece of movie history: the blue and white gingham pinafore dress worn by Judy Garland in the “Wizard of Oz” — which could be worth $1.5 million.

The iconic costume one of five versions of the dress worn by Garland’s Dorothy in the 1939 classic is set to be auctioned off May 24 by Bonhams in Los Angeles at the behest of Catholic University of Washington D.C. where it was discovered in a shoebox inside a storage closet last year.

“I was just surprised after all this time here it had been found and here it is being rushed off to the auction house” Barbara Hartke 81 told The Post.

“I just want to know who has ownership over this … I’d like to see the documentation.” she added.

The costume complete with a short-sleeved blouse of cream organdy and Garland’s name written on a label on the inside was a present from actress Mercedes McCambridge to Hartke’s uncle Rev. Gilbert Hartke a famous-in-his-own-right priest and professor who founded the university’s drama department the family contends in a $3 million Manhattan Federal court lawsuit. It’s unclear how McCambridge came to own the dress.

“I met Mercedes McCambridge a few times and my memory is mostly of her fondness for Uncle Gib” Hartke recalled. “He helped her battle alcoholism. … That was the idea that this was gifted to Gib from her out of deep appreciation.”

Oscar-winner McCambridge a Garland contemporary who is perhaps best known in the modern era for voicing the demon which possessed Linda Blair’s character in “The Exorcist” was the artist in residence at the university from 1972 to 1973.

The “Wizard of Oz” dress one of only two complete versions of the costume known to still exist is being offered at a pre-auction estimate of $800000 to $1.2 million. Another of the surviving Dorothy dresses went for more than $1.5 million in 2015.

“There was no effort to reach out to us or any of the family. It was just like it was there it was found in this box and then immediately we’re off to the races and that was that. Was there anything else found?” wondered Hartke a retired Chicago public school teacher.

Father Hartke the youngest of seven kids who grew up on the north side of Chicago died in 1986 at age 79 of a heart condition. He was a well known figure in Washington D.C. counseling presidents from Harry Truman to Jimmy Carter and mentoring future theater critic Walter Kerr and actors such as Jon Voight and Henry Gibson.

It’s been a whirlwind few days for Hartke’s remaining family who learned of the dress auction via news reports said great-nephew Tony Lehman.

“We’re just focusing right now on ‘What’s the ownership?'” Lehman 60 said.

Catholic University “just ignored the family here” said lawyer Anthony Scordo.

The college insisted to The Post that it is “the rightful owner of the dress. … The actress Mercedes McCambridge donated the dress to Fr. Hartke in his capacity as a professor of drama at Catholic University.”

Her “intent [was] to donate the dress to support the drama students at Catholic University. … The decision was made to auction the dress in order to support the students.”

The university added that Father Hartke as a priest in the Dominican order had “taken a vow of poverty. He vowed not to receive or accept any gifts as his own personal property and at the time of his death did not have any tangible items in his estate.”

Barbara Hartke says there’s no reason to rush the sale.

“It’s not going to evaporate” she said of the dress. “I think it’s sensible to decide ‘What’s the message we want here? What’s the tribute to Uncle Gib? To his kindess and also Mercedes McCambridge and the good people who were touched by him. I think all those things have to be considered.”

Bonhams did not respond to a message seeking comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbGRvc3RhZGFpbHl0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbF9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzLWJyaWVmcy9hcnRpY2xlXzIyYzExZjkyLWQ2ODktNWFjMi04YzllLTZmMDc3YzA3MThiNy5odG1s0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudmFsZG9zdGFkYWlseXRpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsX25ld3MvYnVzaW5lc3MtYnJpZWZzL2FydGljbGVfMjJjMTFmOTItZDY4OS01YWMyLThjOWUtNmYwNzdjMDcxOGI3LmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Business Briefs,"Valdosta GA (31601)

The Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta and its watershed supply water to cities and farms across much of California; they also support commercial and recreational fisheries and provide vital habitat for many endangered native fishes and other aquatic species.

During dry periods most of the outflow from the Delta into San Francisco Bay is required to keep the Delta fresh enough for agricultural and urban uses while during wet periods most outflow is runoff that is too great to be captured and used.

The climate in the watershed is changing: the past two decades have seen record warmth making droughts more intense with higher evaporation and declining snowpack. Water use upstream of the Delta appears to be rising resulting in less inflow to the Delta.

To address declining ecosystem health regulations have also been changing leading to higher outflows and lower water exports to other regions. These changes have not stopped the decline in native species.

To better cope with more intense droughts management of the Delta and its watershed would benefit from a suite of improvements in water use tracking and oversight updates in water flow and quality regulations and cost-effective investments to store more water in wet years.

The Delta is important to all Californians

The Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta lies at the confluence of two of the state’s largest rivers and at the head of the San Francisco Estuary. Forty percent of California’s runoff comes from the Delta watershed. It supplies water to roughly 30 million residents and more than 6 million acres of farmland upstream of and within the Delta as well as in other watersheds including the Bay Area the southern San Joaquin Valley the Central Coast and Southern California. The ecological health of the Delta and the reliability of its water supplies are in decline. Given the challenges facing the watershed and the competing uses for scarce supplies Delta water management issues are a source of conflict and many misunderstandings about water use. Weak water accounting systems make this worse.

Runoff in the Delta watershed has many destinations

Surface water available in the Delta watershed in any given year can be broken down into three broad categories:",https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Karin Upton Baker’s legal stoush with Kennards storage,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/truecrimeaustralia/police-courts-nsw/hermes-australia-boss-karin-upton-baker-launches-supreme-court-action-against-kennards-storage/news-story/04808897b6e37ec3e8422658f8887fb1 on URL https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

When squabbling politicians fail to provide effective public services and spend all the people’s money it can be tempting to wish a giant hand would reach down and make everything right.

That’s what Congress has tried to do over the past six years in Puerto Rico a state-sized U.S. colony with twice the population of Philadelphia. A Penn law school bankruptcy professor David S. Skeel headed the effort for most of its existence climaxing in January with the plan’s approval by federal Judge Laura Taylor Swain.

Under U.S. law individuals businesses and even cities can go bankrupt but states and colonies cannot. So what’s happened in Puerto Rico is a blueprint for what could happen as aging U.S. states such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania continue to spend money they don’t have.

In 2015 Puerto Rico owed Wall Street investors $72 billion which then-Gov. Alejandro García Padilla said the island could not pay. It also faced a pension deficit of over $50 billion — almost as large as Pennsylvania’s for a population less than one-fourth its size.

So Congress in 2016 approved the oversight board known locally as la Junta comprising a small group of businessmen financiers and scholars. It was appointed by President Barack Obama and his successors to restructure Puerto Rico’s debt taxes and spending after elected leaders couldn’t agree on a working plan. Natalie Jaresko the American-born former Ukraine finance minister is its paid executive director.

The board demanded cuts and delays for Puerto Rico’s debts it said should never have been approved under the island’s laws. It pushed for asset sales to raise cash spending cuts to avoid going broke and sought to replace unfunded pensions with private-sector-style savings plans.

Its members were aggressively criticized by leftists and labor leaders who saw these “traitors” as selling out the fatherland and by Wall Street “vulture” investors who demanded full repayment even on high-risk bonds they had bought at deep discounts.

The plan’s approval followed long delays for ruinous hurricanes and the pandemic. The board said the plan “reduces the debt by 80% and saved Puerto Rico more than $50 billion” in long-term payments adding that Puerto Rico can now move on “from financial instability and insolvency to a future of opportunity and growth.”

Skeel’s books include Debt’s Dominion which argues U.S. bankruptcy laws helped speed the nation to prosperity. He says his work is informed by his faith as an evangelical Christian. His Wall Street Journal essay last year cited biblical precedent for reducing Puerto Rico’s debt while ensuring one pays the debts one can.

Skeel recently answered questions about the plan. This interview is edited for clarity and brevity.

The U.S. Bankruptcy Code lets cities reorganize but not states. Is this a one-of-a-kind deal or a model states might follow?

This is the largest public debt restructuring in American history. When we are at the point where folks are talking seriously about bankruptcy for states this will be the touchstone.

I’ve been a big advocate of bankruptcy for states. This has been sobering. It took a long time. This has given me a better sense of how complicated the balance sheet is for a public entity that has a very complicated set of constituencies for whom it is providing goods and services.

And now I’m pretty optimistic. I think it’s a great deal for Puerto Rico and a completely fair deal for the creditors. Puerto Rico’s population is rising again [to an estimated 3.3 million in 2021 from 3.2 million in 2019].

What did the judge finally approve?

We settled the general obligation bonds the biggest part of the debt at 85 cents to 90 cents [payback to investors for every dollar borrowed]. The rates are fixed [so the Fed’s interest rate hikes will have limited effect].

We converted the Employee Retirement System [to a private-sector-style savings plan without the taxpayer guarantees]. We froze the pension [for people still working]. Those vested will get that money.

Retirees and beneficiaries have no cuts at all Gov. [Pedro] Pierluisi insisted on that. There was a freeze on pension cost-of-living increases.

There were $3 billion in pension bonds. They will get a lower payout than the investors wanted. They litigated with us and we won.

Pension managers had used that borrowed money to buy private equity investments that did poorly?

I hope there’s never another time they borrow. The pension bondholders get 20 cents on the dollar.

But you still have that $50 billion legacy pension deficit. How are you going to pay that?

We set up a pension trust to set aside money. The government is required to pay in at least $175 million a year.

The unions resisted the pension freeze; the last three governors urged them to fight you on that no?

We made a deal with the American Federation of Teachers but the locals voted down the plan. It went to court. [On April 26 the First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for the board.]

What keeps future governments with all the pressure they face from again spending more than they collect?

One cool thing in the plan is a 10-year debt management policy. There are limits on how much they can borrow and limits on interest rates and it has to be used for capital improvements [not new hires or other operating costs].

What did you most insist on?

The thing that mattered to me most was how much debt responsibility Puerto Rico would have going forward. We drew a line in the sand at $1.15 billion a year. I said we are not going higher than that.

And it turned out there was more cash than some of us had expected because Puerto Rico hadn’t been paying debt for five years and the tax money and the federal disaster money started accumulating.

And we added a “contingent value instrument” (CVI) keyed to sales tax revenues. In Puerto Rico the sales tax is high about 11%. Almost half of that is set aside to pay creditors. But if they collect more sales tax than we projected some [of the increase] will go to pay more debt.

There is very limited debt going forward compared to what it was. The bondholders get a good payback. The clawback [for bond insurers] is not as good.

What about PREPA the power company?

PREPA has not been settled yet. We’re doing that. The government has brought in a private transmission and distribution operator [LUMA Energy owned by Quanta Services of Houston and Canada-based ATCO]. They had outages after they came in last summer and complaints. Things are getting better.

Will the island switch away from expensive imported fuel?

They have put out a request-for-proposals [to replace] the existing generation operations and to bring renewables online. There is a governmental policy to be 100% renewables by 2035.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted that costs in the present are “laying the groundwork” for this technology to hit the mainstream.

In spite of the skepticism Qualcomm (QCOM) CEO Cristiano Amon agrees that the best has yet to come for metaverse adoption and investment.

“It's real it's going to be a very big opportunity” Amon told Yahoo Finance Live. “We started investing in fundamental technologies that allow the merger of physical and digital spaces over a decade ago. It's no secret that because of those early investments for the over 40 virtual reality and augmented reality devices that exist in the world [they are] all powered by Qualcomm.”

Amon joined Yahoo Finance Live from the 2022 Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles in an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance’s Alexandra Garfinkle. Amon discussed the company’s presence in the auto industry partnerships competition and the metaverse.

And while Meta’s $3 billion bill for Reality Labs in the first quarter of 2022 may seem hefty the business lost more than $10 billion throughout 2021. Horizon Worlds Meta’s flagship VR social app piloted creator monetization features late in the quarter and is expected to launch a web version to extend access to those who do not own an Oculus Quest 2 or similar headset. The platform reached a milestone of 300000 users earlier this year.

According to Amon Qualcomm continues to maintain existing and secure new partnerships with industry giants like Meta and Microsoft (MSFT) to provide hardware and software for their extended reality (XR) businesses.

“One of our biggest partnerships is with Meta” he said. “We have had a very successful partnership with them for VR with the Quest and the Quest 2. We announced at CES that we're now doing a custom chip for augmented reality with Microsoft as the Microsoft HoloLens gets ready to scale and we announced a partnership for example [a partnership] with ByteDance for VR for Tiktok.”

Investment risks

The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.50% on Wednesday in an effort to pump the brakes on surging inflation. In light of the Fed’s hawkish interest rate hike campaign uncertainty remains in regard to metaverse investment as investors begin to favor value over growth stocks.

The issuance of exchange-traded funds like the ProShares Metaverse ETF (VERS) demonstrates that some investors both institutional and retail recognize the opportunity in metaverse. However the fund and similar ETFs like it have been hammered by macroeconomic conditions.

In any case Amon maintains optimism for the future of metaverse and XR technology.

“We have a number of different developments to eventually be able to create companion to your smartphone with fully immersive augmented reality glasses that actually is going to look like [normal glasses]” he said. “And I think that's a big opportunity. It could be as big as phones.”

If you look closely at their specifications most of them use the current top-end Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip. Reviewers and ordinary users complain about this SoC due to overheating problems; and hope that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 Plus will heat up less.

So there is an assumption that the whole point is in the design of the chipset and its optimization by smartphone manufacturers. It is hoped that smartphone manufacturers will pay more attention to adapting the work of Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 because Qualcomm does not intend to change the architecture. According to the well-known insider Digital Chat Station work is underway on the successor to Snapdragon 8 Gen 1; and the cores in it will be located in three clusters according to the “1 + 3 + 4” scheme. They will offer one super-core of the Cortex X family three high-performance cores and a quartet of energy-efficient cores.

Snapdragon 8 Gen 2: specifications and who will produce it

They promise a new 5G Snapdragon X70 modem with a peak data download speed of 10 Gbps and an updated neural engine to accelerate the execution of operations sharpened by artificial intelligence and machine learning. Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 received the SM8550 model number and its announcement will take place at the end of this year. The production of the chip was entrusted to the Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC and presumably the processor will again be manufactured according to the standards of 4-nanometer technology.

The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 Plus SoC; which will appear in the new Samsung foldable smartphones will get a delay before entering the market.

Initially Qualcomm’s plan was to announce the platform in May but now there is a delay in dates. The source says the final decision will come out in the second half of the year. These are very vague dates but the Galaxy Z Flip4 and Fold4 will launch in late August or early September; so Qualcomm’s new product should already be ready by that time.

The timing shift is due to the aggravation of the situation with the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Because of this factories are closed and the plans of many companies are violated. Recall that the first smartphone with the new Qualcomm SoC should be the Motorola Edge 30 Ultra. Considering that the Edge 30 Pro was the first to get the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1; this looks like a good bet.

So in less than a week they should introduce the Google Pixel 6a and before the end of the month; they promise the release of the Redmi Note 11T series and the Xiaomi Mi Band 7 fitness bracelet. In the second half of the year Xiaomi plans to announce a number of flagships including the Xiaomi 12S and Xiaomi 12S Pro.

Previously it was assumed that these models will receive the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 Plus chipset and information about this was shared by the Xiaomiui resource which found a mention of this platform in the MIUI source code. Now the same source has changed its prediction saying that the Xiaomi 12S Pro will be based on the Dimensity 9000 processor. Interestingly when talking about the new product the publication calls it Xiaomi 12S Pro Dimensity 9000 Edition. This makes us speculate that there is a possibility that the smartphone will be available on two hardware platforms. Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 Plus and Dimensity 9000.

Xiaomi 12S Pro will be Xiaomi’s first non-Qualcomm flagship

Like it or not we will know for sure after the announcement of Xiaomi 12S Pro. Presumably the smartphone and its basic version may be available at the end of July or August of this year. We expect that the smartphones will not enter the global market and will remain exclusive to China.

Lu Weibing general manager of Xiaomi’s Redmi brand recently posted a message on Weibo; that new Redmi Note series smartphones are in preparation for release.

The existing Redmi Note 11 family (pictured) includes models at different levels in particular the base variant; as well as more powerful versions of the Note 11 Pro and Note 11 Pro+.

The upcoming smartphones will most likely be merged into the Redmi Note 12 series. Mr. Weibing did not go into details about the technical characteristics of the devices; noting only that they will provide a performance boost compared to their predecessors.

The Redmi executive noted that the company will adhere to the strategy of releasing two series of Note devices within a year. Thus smartphones of the Redmi Note 12 family will debut in the current half of the year and Redmi Note 13 devices can be expected in the second half of 2022.

According to IDC estimates 314.1 million smartphones were in sale globally in the first quarter of this year. This is 8.9% less than a year earlier when shipments were 344.7 million units.

As TSMC reveals its Q1 2022 quarterly earnings report this week Neil Shah the VP of Counterpoint Research also recently shared a report on the breakdown of the TSMC’s clients by platform.

Historically TSMC’s highest revenue earner is the smartphone industry with tech giants like Apple Qualcomm and MediaTek ordering their small yet high-density chip wafers for smartphone chipset production. However in Q1 2022 in an unexpected upset it seems that the HPC(high-performance computing) market has dethroned the smartphone market in being TSMC’s highest revenue earner among its clients base.

High-performance computing normally refers to the processors found on your desktop or laptop as these processors require higher clock speeds and in turn have higher power draws. Among TSMC’s HPC clients are Apple’s M1 Series of Apple Silicon SoCs for its Macbooks AMD with their Ryzen desktop and laptop CPUs and their Radeon GPUs and Nvidia with their MX and GTX lineup of budget to midrange dedicated graphic cards.

Looking back at the data HPC which accounts for 41% of TSMC’s revenue has surpassed smartphones which only account for 40% of the company’s revenue. For revenue growth trends by platform TSMC concluded that its HPC client revenue rose 26% quarter-on-quarter for Q1 making it one of the highest growing industry clients for the company. The other vital industry is the automotive industry which has also seen a growth of 26% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2022.

Another graph published by Counterpoint Research also points out that the newest 5nm and 7nm advanced nodes now account for 50% of TSMC’s revenue portfolio as of Q1 2022. This may be due to the fact that smartphones and HPC Clients such as Apple AMD MediaTek and Qualcomm have been placing orders with TSMC in regards to their latest high-density chip wafers for better performance in consumer smartphones and consumer laptops.

Just two months after its installation greenery is already cascading from its walls as the class readies itself for its first harvest and the home-grown feast that will come with it.

What You Need To Know Trotwood-Madison schools are starting a classroom gardening program



Students can eat what they grow in the classroom and learn how to cook and identify healthy foods



The tower and curriculum came from Green Bronx Machine through a grant from Quest Diagnostics



The program aims to improve food access and combat food insecurity

Cossey’s is the first classroom in the Trotwood-Madison school district to adopt the Green Bronx Machine curriculum which gets aeroponics tower gardens into classrooms across the country. The machine which requires no soil provides its own light and recycles its water is a fast-growing self-sustaining method taking up far less space and resources as traditional gardening.

“When they’re first starting out it takes about a gallon a week"" said Cossey about the tower. ""Now that they’re bigger they’ll do about two gallons”

Through the program classes like Cossey’s can get hands-on lessons growing and cultivating the vegetables and herbs in the machine while also learning about conservation and alternative methods of growing.

For Mayor Mary McDonald the best part of the program is where all this food is going right back to the community that grew it.

“Food insecurity can touch any community” she said. “That’s what we focused on here in Trotwood.”

Trotwood’s last grocery store closed in 2019. Since then it's been harder to access fresh healthy affordable food especially for those with limited transportation. Meanwhile across Montgomery County Feeding America reports one in five children is considered food insecure.

As a part of the 2021 Leadership Ohio program McDonald said she and a cohort of leaders from across the state were looking for community-based solutions to food access in communities like hers.

“We have not always been a food desert and many communities are finding that they’re being challenged with that simply because the retail business is changing so much” she said.

Through their research they learned about Stephen Ritz and his Green Bronx Machine program focused on tackling a similar issue in and around New York City and sought to expand it in their community.

A $50000 grant from Quest Diagnostics covered the cost of the garden curriculum materials and the first year of seeds and Cossey said as soon as her students got planting everything grew quickly.

“We got our first zucchini blossoms and the tomatoes began to flower” Cossey said. “They should be ready to eat soon.”

In the meantime Cossey’s students have been trying some of the faster-growing lettuce plants and herbs giving students the opportunity to try or identify some of these plants for the first time.

“Before we started growing I asked students to make a list of list of herbs and they struggled” Cossey said.

Now they’re trying the flavors in the classroom and discussing how they can use them to cook up a few healthy meals in the next weeks.

“Anybody got any delicious ideas?” Cossey asked her classroom as the students got up to inspect the garden’s progress.

Once the food is ready to harvest they’ll try a few recipes in class and take some home to their families helping spread the impact throughout the community.

Meanwhile McDonald says she’s looking forward to seeing the impact the program can have once it’s implemented for a full school year.

“We can see future engineers coming out of this simply because this is the wave of the future” she said. “We’re not necessarily going to be growing things in the grounds we’re going to be using hydroponics and we’re going to be using these kinds of machinery to be able to provide food of the future.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vbWl4ZWQtbmV3cy5jb20vZW4vcXVlc3QtMi1haXItbGluay1vbi13aW5kb3dzLTExLWhvdy10by1maXgtdGhlLXN0dXR0ZXJpbmcv0gFZaHR0cHM6Ly9taXhlZC1uZXdzLmNvbS9lbi9xdWVzdC0yLWFpci1saW5rLW9uLXdpbmRvd3MtMTEtaG93LXRvLWZpeC10aGUtc3R1dHRlcmluZy8_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Quest 2 Air Link on Windows 11: How to fix the stuttering,"Quest 2 Air Link on Windows 11: How to fix the stuttering

Meta's Air Link does not run smoothly on Windows 11 in some cases. But with a simple fix you can achieve smooth streaming with Meta Quest 2 and Microsoft's latest operating system.

With Air Link you can wirelessly stream PC VR content to the Meta Quest 2 via a native app. This allows you to play graphically rich PC VR games with the otherwise standalone VR headset.

Although Microsoft has been offering Windows 11 for about half a year Meta still recommends a computer with Windows 10 for Air Link. For good reason because Air Link does not run ideally under Windows 11 in many cases.

Meta Quest 2 Air Link stutters under Windows 11

Anyone who has already given their computer a Windows upgrade will have encountered a major problem when using Air Link under Windows 11 for the first time: unpleasant judder.

Almost six months after the launch of Windows 11 there is still no official update from Meta that adapts Air Link to Windows 11. However you can help yourself with a workaround. We'll show you how to get Air Link working under Windows 11.

Here's how to fix the stuttering of Air Link on Windows 11

Open the Oculus app for on your PC or laptop. Jump to the Oculus directory and open the Oculus Debug Tool (ODT). By default the file path is C: Programs OculusSupport oculus-diagnostics.

Open the ""Service"" tab and click on ""Toggle console window visibility"" in the dropdown menu. Confirm the request to restart the Oculus service. You must now keep the displayed console window open and active. Don't close it don't minimize it. This is the only way Air Link will run without stuttering.

If you want to close the console window you need to repeat the steps up to the Service tab drop-down menu and click ""Toggle console window visibility"" again.

Alternative to Air Link on Windows 11

As an alternative to Air Link for smooth Quest 2 streaming we recommend the third-party app Virtual Desktop. It also runs smoothly under Windows 11 and Wi-Fi 6. Virtual Desktop is currently available from the Meta or SteamVR store for around $20. Developer Guy Godin recently released an update for Virtual Desktop that adds more features and supports hand tracking 2.0 for the Quest 2.

The Ballet Theatre of Carmel Academy (BTCA) will soon present Pyotr Tchaikovsky’s Swan Lake. This is the company’s third performance of the highly regarded ballet.

“The production shows the ambition of this group” BTCA Co-artistic Director Jane Hachiya-Weiner said. “Swan Lake is a challenging work and our dancers were eager to take it on.”

BTCA again has sponsors partnering for this production. All activities are underwritten in part by the Indiana Arts Commission and National Endowment for the Arts. Executive Financial Planning Group – Raymond James supported BTCA as the top-level sponsor for The Nutcracker and they return as a top sponsor for Swan Lake.

“We’re thrilled to have them return as a significant partner” Hachiya-Weiner said. “They’re part of the team along with other sponsors and parent volunteers. They all make it happen.”

Molly and the Magic Suitcase – Kids Travel Books is the other notable sponsor at present. Additional sponsorship opportunities are available with more information available at ballettheatreofcarmel.org/sponsorship. For advertising information visit ballettheatreofcarmel.org/program-ads.

The cast is made up of 70 dancers ranging in age from 5 to 21. They include dancers from BTCA’s Elementary Intermediate Advanced and Pre-Professional levels. Also included in this number are 24 children ages 5 to 8 who are part of the “Be A Fairy” Program. Dancers hail from Carmel Zionsville Westfield Indianapolis Fishers Brownsburg and Crawfordsville.

The cast features six high school seniors from area schools including Westfield Carmel Heritage Christian and Brebeuf Jesuit.

“This group lobbied hard for Swan Lake” Hachiya-Weiner said. “We’ll all get to see the reflection of their commitment to it in their performance.”

Other cast members are new to both Academy and dance performance including several up-and-coming younger dancers.

“No question we have some talented younger soloists featured throughout” Hachiya-Weiner said “and this ballet provides opportunities for many to shine.”

Some the youngest dancers are part of BTCA’s Be a Fairy program.

“It’s a special thing we do for every production” Hachiya-Weiner said. “The program is for ages five to eight and it is both a light introduction to the dancing world for newcomers and an introduction to performance for our young students.”

Swan Lake performances will take place at 2 and 7:30 p.m. on Saturday May 28 at the STAR Bank Performing Arts Center 1000 Mulberry St. Zionsville. Tickets are on sale now at ballettheatreofcarmel.org/swan-lake. Prices are $20 for children and seniors and $25 for adults.

The old and most of the young among us will know David Crosby as the American singer-songwriter who rose to fame with The Byrds and later joined forces with Neil Young Stephen Stills and Graham Nash in various combinations. Throughout his illustrious career Crosby has been lucky enough to work with other leading folk figures like Joni Mitchell and Bob Dylan who gave the Byrds their first number one hit with ‘Mr. Tambourine Man’.

His most successful and long-lasting act however has been with Crosby Stills and Nash who have toured on and off throughout the last five decades. The most recent outing of the trio was in 2015 and since then they have only stuck to isolated solo performances and one-off collaborations.

On the surface one could derive that Crosby has had an easy road in life with his successful career in music but in reality his life has been littered with lesser-known misfortune and regret. For much of his career Crosby battled addiction problems mainly with heroin and cocaine. In fact he once even spent nine months in prison on drug and weapon possession-related charges. More widely known of course are Crosby’s various feuds with fellow musicians chiefly with longtime collaborator Neil Young.

Another quieter detail of Crosby’s life is that he has a long-lost son whom he gave up for adoption back in 1962. In 1994 Crosby’s doctor told him that he needed an immediate liver transplant as his current one had been damaged beyond repair. While he was preparing for the transplant Crosby was notified that his long-lost son had been searching for him.

Following the successful transplant operation Crosby finally reunited with his son James Raymond. As fate would have it Raymond is a budding musician who had built up a successful career as a keyboardist and composer.

When Raymond was born his father was just 21 years old and so he and the mother whom Crosby declines to publicly identify immediately put the newborn up for adoption. While waiting for his new liver at the hospital in the mid-1990s Crosby began thinking of his son. “I was in the hospital dying and I knew that I had a son out there someplace” Crosby told The Baltimore Sun. “I had been beating myself up for years about not being there for this kid.”

Fortunately Raymond was given a supportive childhood and became successful in his career which has been highlighted by collaborations with Chaka Khan and a role as musical director for a popular Nickelodeon series. From a young age Raymond was aware that he was adopted but didn’t seek out his birth father until he was in his late 20s. When he finally realised that his father was David Crosby it came as quite a shock.

After meeting the pair got on extremely well and naturally had a lot in common. “He was this nice decent young guy and we became friends immediately” Crosby said. Before long the reunited father and son decided to form a jazz-rock band and called it CPR (Crosby Pevar and Raymond). By January 1997 CPR were touring and performing together.

In July 2021 Crosby released his solo album For Free which was produced and co-written by his son. On his website Raymond discusses working on the LP. “Lyrically where I started was this visual of agricultural workers in the Central Valley of California truck drivers labourers starting their workday early in the cold of morning … knowing that it would get hot as hell as the day wore on” Raymond said. “I wanted to speak of their resiliency and spirit and that of so many other working folks across the USA.”

It is the first Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 we have spotted with a blower cooler unearthed by Twitter user Zed Wang. This cooler style is sometimes frowned upon by PC gamers and enthusiasts but they can have attractive qualities for small form factor and server systems.

The Leadtek GeForce RTX 3050 Classic has reference specs for an Nvidia retail partner card – 2560 CUDA cores a base clock of 1552 MHz and a boost clock 1777 MHz plus 8GB of GDDR5 14 Gbps memory on a 128-bit bus. In addition it uses one 8-pin power connector which is plenty for its 130W max power draw.

Nvidia didn't produce a reference design RTX 3050; it left it to its AIB partners to rustle up whatever they fancied. As a result most just used the same coolers on near neighbor cards like the GeForce RTX 3060 or GTX 1660 Super. And this is the case with the Leadtek GeForce RTX 3050 Classic.

Image 1 of 3 (Image credit: Zed Wang) (Image credit: Zed Wang) (Image credit: Zed Wang)

If you look at Leadtek's product pages you will see the new GeForce RTX 3050 Classic nestled among similar cooler-equipped cards like the RTX 3060 Classic RTX 3060 Ti Classic and RTX 3070 AI Blower. Predictably there are Leadtek GeForce GTX 1660 / Super / Ti Classic cards. They all look pretty much the same and every model was two slots wide at 35mm and just a little taller than the bracket height at 111mm though lengths varied a little. The new Leadtek GeForce RTX 3050 Classic is 253mm long.

There are some excellent reasons to choose a blower-style cooler. For consumers probably the best and most relevant reason to opt for a blower will be to use a PC case with little space inside or that features a component or other add-in-card that blocks GPU fans. The blower design is attractive in this situation as it takes its hot air and jets it out the back of the slot area. Recent blower designs aren't as noisy as when this cooler style first became established in the graphics card market; however we haven't had a Leadtek in the labs to vouch for its cooling fan noise properties.

If you read our review of the GeForce RTX 3050 from January this year you will be aware that it only scrapes into the top 12 of the Best Graphics Cards for Gaming in 2022. Nevertheless it might fit your needs and you may notice one at an irresistible price. GeForce RTX 3050 graphics cards come in a wide variety of cooler types. Some of them seem overkill like the triple fan Aorus Elite but most AIB products are dual fan designs with Asus and MSI providing single fan versions. As for this blower cooler card from Leadtek – it is always good to have options.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9hc3VzLW5vY3R1YS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDgwLWNhcmQtcGljdHVyZWQtZmVhdHVyZXMtcXVhZC1zbG90LWNvb2xpbmctc29sdXRpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ASUS/Noctua GeForce RTX 3080 card pictured features quad-slot cooling solution,"ASUS to release a new GeForce graphics card with Noctua cooling

The RTX 3080 will be the new SKU featuring the iconic brown Noctua fans.

Nearly half a year after the introduction of the first ASUS graphics card designed with collaboration with Noctua we finally get a new SKU. This time around it’s the GA102-based model the RTX 3080. Interestingly the company opted for the 10GB version not the 12GB model that launched in January. Thus no one should probably be saying that 10GB model is being phased out at this point.

The card features a very similar quad-slot cooling solution with two 120 mm fans. Based on our quick check both the RTX 3080 and RTX 3070 appear to be the same size the cooling solution has not changed much but the heatsink is obviously modified for a bigger GPU.

The card is equipped with dual 8-pin power connectors and non-standard display connectors: 3x DisplayPort 1.4 and dual HDMI 2.1. It appears to be the same board design as RTX 3080 TUF series.

The card can be found listed at 1150 EUR which is 250 EUR more expensive than RTX 3070 Noctua. ASUS has thus far not provided any information on this model.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9yZXZpZXcvMjQ2MC1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC0zMDYwLXZzLXJhZGVvbi02NjAwLXh0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GeForce RTX 3060 vs Radeon RX 6600 XT,"Today we're comparing the Radeon RX 6600 XT and GeForce RTX 3060 head-to-head to see how these two GPUs stack up using the latest drivers in a wide range of games. Even though the Radeon carries an MSRP of $380 while the RTX 3060 is meant to cost $330 in reality they're competing products both selling for about $400 at major online retailers.

That's quite a drop for the RTX 3060 which was closer to $500 a few weeks ago while the 6600 XT was around $440. Meanwhile supply for the 6600 XT appears to be drying up and that's probably due to the imminent release of the 6650 XT.

For testing we've used our Ryzen 9 5950X test system with 32GB of DDR4-3200 CL14 dual-rank dual-channel memory. Both GPUs were tested using the default AMD and Nvidia clock specifications at 1080p and 1440p across 50 games with Resizable Bar enabled. The driver versions used were Radeon Adrenalin 22.4.2 and GeForce Game Ready Driver 512.59 as these were the latest available drivers when we started testing a week ago.

We won't go over the data for all 50 games individually as that would take all day instead we're going to take a close look at the results for about a dozen of them and then we'll take a look at how these two GPUs compare head-to-head across all games tested in a single graph.

Benchmarks

Starting with Dying Light 2 this recently released game uses a proprietary 3D game engine developed by Techland known as Chrome Engine 6 and it's the only game in our test suite to use it.

Dying Light 2 plays well with Radeon GPUs and here the 6600 XT is 11% faster at 1080p and 8% faster at 1440p. Perhaps more impressive is that both GPUs rendered well over 60 fps at 1080p using the highest quality settings with the exception of ray tracing which isn't enabled by default.

Warhammer III is another new game and this one uses the Warscape Engine 3 which is used exclusively by the Total War series. Here the GeForce GPUs currently enjoy a small performance advantage.

In this matchup the RTX 3060 was 9% faster at 1080p and 14% faster at 1440p which is a significant margin though the 1% lows are basically identical.

Next we have Call of Duty Warzone where the 6600 XT was quite a bit faster than the RTX 3060 delivering 21% more frames at 1080p and 16% more at 1440p. A strong win for the Radeon GPU though keep in mind it was also meant to cost 15% more based on the original MSRP.

Forza Horizon 5 is a well optimized title that plays well on both hardware platforms. We are using the extreme preset so this is as demanding as the game gets yet we're still looking at 61 fps on average from both GPUs at 1440p. Performance was very similar with no clear winner.

God of War is another well optimized title and while it does play well on the 6600 XT it plays much better with the RTX 3060 especially at 1440p. We did double check these results and it would seem the RTX 3060 is 15% faster at 1080p and a whopping 33% faster at 1440p. A massive win for Nvidia in this game.

Far Cry 6 uses the Dunia 2 engine and this one runs very well on AMD hardware largely helped by the fact that AMD had a hand in sponsoring the game's development. As a result the 6600 XT enjoys a strong 13% performance advantage at 1080p and was able to maintain a double digit win at 1440p where it was 10% faster.

Typically Radeon GPUs perform well in the F1 series but F1 2021 enables ray tracing by default at the highest presets and therefore we tested with the feature enabled. This hands the RTX 3060 a performance advantage affording it a 6% performance advantage at 1080p and 10% at 1440p. Disabling ray tracing does favor the 6600 XT but we feel we might as well test using the default configuration as that's how we normally test and we're still looking at around 60 fps at 1440p.

Next we have Metro Exodus Enhanced and this version of the game requires ray traced accelerated hardware so ray tracing effects are enabled by default and for testing these mid-range GPUs we've gone with the 'normal' setting.

Although the 6600 XT was able to deliver highly playable performance at 1080p the RTX 3060 was 29% faster and that meant we were seeing similar frame rates at 1440p from the GeForce GPU compared to what the 6600 XT could do at 1080p.

The Rainbow Six Extraction performance was comparable with both GPUs delivering over 130 fps at 1080p. The RTX 3060 did edge ahead by a 7% margin at 1440p but overall performance was very similar.

Performance was also similar when testing with Apex Legends. In short the 6600 XT was slightly faster at 1080p and then slightly slower at 1440p. Both GPUs proved plenty powerful for this title though delivering over 100 fps at 1440p using the highest in-game quality settings.

Another competitive title that delivered competitive results is Fortnite. Although most Fortnite players won't run the Epic preset we're interested in testing GPU performance and not CPU performance which is where things quickly head with competitive settings.

Assuming you don't run into CPU bound conditions Radeon and GeForce GPUs scale very similarly with the quality presets so using competitive settings both the 6600 XT and RTX 3060 will deliver a similar level of performance.

The last set of results we're going to look at are for Cyberpunk 2077 and here the 6600 XT was 9% faster using the high quality settings at 1080p. Both GPUs are best suited to 1080p gaming in this title as the slightly dialed down quality settings saw just 44 fps rendered on average at 1440p.

Performance Summary

Based on the games we just looked at the RTX 3060 and 6600 XT appear to be extremely close in terms of performance. There were a few titles that heavily favor one over the other but for the most part performance was close.

We did spend a week testing through 50 games though so let's check that out...

Starting with the 1080p data we see that the 6600 XT was 3% faster on average meaning they're basically identical overall across a wide range of games as we deem anything within 5% a draw. That means for 20 of the 50 games tested performance was near enough to ""identical"" with margins 4% or less.

There were just a handful of outliers where the margins extended to 10% or more in either direction. The big losses for AMD were seen in Resident Evil Village and Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition unsurprisingly two of the games that used ray tracing. Vermintide 2 God of War and PUBG were also bad titles for AMD.

Titles where the 6600 XT performed exceptionally well included Assassin's Creed Valhalla World War Z Borderlands 3 Warzone Call of Duty Vanguard and Death Stranding.

Increasing the resolution to 1440p flipped the results in Nvidia's favor as now the 6600 XT was 2% slower overall but again that margin is insignificant. This time there were 23 games where the margin was 5% or less with just three outliers with a few games in either direction exceeding 20%.

Picking a Winner: Go RTX

Depending on the resolution and the game played one GPU might be faster than the other. There were instances where the margins grew to almost 30% which is very significant so you may want to pay attention to how these Radeon and GeForce GPUs stack up in the games you care about the most.

When looking at our 50 game sample – and that's a substantial number of games to test – it's fair to conclude that in most instances there will be less than a 10% difference between these two GPUs.

Having said that once you take the full picture into account it's hard not to argue that the GeForce RTX 3060 is the better buy and is even worth a premium. This is because when you start to look at what each product offers beyond rasterization performance there's not much to talk about when it comes to the 6600 XT.

The RTX 3060 packs a 50% larger frame buffer with 12 GB opposed to 8 GB so it should handle future HD texture packs a lot better meaning future AAA titles could potentially look better without hurting frame rate performance. In our opinion that's a nice bonus that shouldn't be overlooked.

The RTX 3060 also packs a full x16 PCIe 4.0 connection whereas the 6600 XT is cut down to just 8 lanes and this can cause serious performance issues when exceeding the memory buffer. That's another reason why the memory subsystem of the RTX 3060 is vastly superior.

On top of that you get DLSS which is widely supported by many new AAA titles and it works really well at 1440p and beyond and that's resolutions where the RTX 3060 could do with a performance boost.

AMD offers some upscaling techniques for 6600 XT owners and more plans are in the works to head off the DLSS threat but for now DLSS is the best option. Then there's ray tracing which is yet another strength of the RTX 3060. As we saw in the titles that use this rendering technique the GeForce GPU had a clear performance advantage thanks to its more mature implementation.

In a nutshell: the RTX 3060 offers similar rasterization performance superior ray tracing DLSS support a bigger VRAM buffer and a full PCIe 4.0 x16 connection making it a better product – and if available at the same price the obvious option.

Whether or not AMD can tempt us with the Radeon RX 6650 XT has yet to be seen but we're keen to look into that very soon.

The recent photos on the website VideoCardz look very close to the previous GeForce RTX 3070 series card that the two companies also worked together to create. From the pictures provided there are minimal tweaks to the component.

Noctua & ASUS Come Together Once Again To Offer GeForce RTX 3080 OC In Quad-Slot Cooling Design

Last year ASUS and Noctua joined forces to make a graphics card with Noctua's exceptional cooling technology. The card based on the design was the GeForce RTX 3070 from NVIDIA. Users were concerned that the series was being replaced since ASUS had released no information over several months. Now the two have brought their collective minds together to offer the Noctua ASUS RTX 3080 graphics card offering a memory of 10GB. The card is based on the GA102 SKU but interestingly provides only 10GB instead of 12GB such as the model released almost five months ago.

The new ASUS GeForce RTX 3080 10GB OC graphics card offers the well-known brown Noctua fan design two on the card and a quad-slot cooling technology. The RTX 3070 and 3080 models appear identical in size and have a similar format. The most significant change between the two cards is the altered heatsink to fit the larger GPU.

The card also provides two eight-pin connections for power adorn the card three DisplayPort 1.4 connections and two HDMI 2.1 connections. The board structure appears to be taken from the RTX 3080 TUF card that ASUS also designs. However it maintains more of the Noctua aesthetic.

Blige appears to have an affinity for blue stiletto boots as of late. She wore a pair of glittery light blue knee-high stiletto boots to her album premiere party on Feb. 11 then wore a pair of dark blue thigh-high stiletto boots to promote the same album less than a month later on April 4. Most recently Blige wore a pair of denim thigh-high Dolce & Gabanna boots courtside to watch the Brooklyn Nets play against the Boston Celtics on April 24.

The Strength of a Woman Festival and Summit is a three-day comedy music and community-building event happening between May 6 and May 8 in Atlanta which was curated for women by women. During the event Atlanta presented Blige with her own “Strength of a Woman Day” which recognizes May 5 as an official holiday in the city.

For the video Aguilera wears a crimson red dress that has her channeling the title of her song which translates to “The Queen.” Simply put Aguilera looks like full-on royalty.

For the performance-based music video the 41-year-old star sings with a mariachi band while wearing a gorgeous red Garo Sparo corset gown which features a longline V-neck boned bodice extending down her hips. The bodice which laces beautifully up the back features elegant sleeves that drape off the shoulders one of which is slightly longer than the other creating asymmetry.

The regal gown’s elegant skirt starts at the low hips spilling into a floor-sweeping style with a cascading off-center slit and a sizable train. Aguilera’s gown features a large red rose detail at one of the hips adding even more royal flare.

To accent the dress Aguilera wore her ginger hair down her back with the pop star pulling the front portion of her hair into a braided crown at the top of her head. Aguilera wore a minimal glam makeup look in the music video which was focused around a rosy carved eye look and a nude lip. She appeared to wear no jewelry save for tiny gold hoop earrings that hugged her lobes.

“La Reina” is just one song off of the singer’s six-track EP “La Fuerza” which was released in January 2022. The album marks Aguilera’s first Spanish-language release in 20 years according to Billboard.

Many draw the right lesson from this: that religious difference alone is not a sufficient condition for nationhood and the Muslim League’s two-nation theory was buried under the jackboot of a genocidal West Pakistani army and its backers. Despite being the numerical majority the Bengalis of East Pakistan were aggrieved at being treated as second-class citizens by their West Pakistani counterparts. Matters came to a head when the military dictatorship conspired with West Pakistani politicians to deny the Awami League’s Sheikh Mujibur Rahman the prime ministership despite his winning the 1970 elections. Less than a year later Pakistan was broken and defeated.

When asked how he went bankrupt one of Hemingway’s characters famously replies “Gradually then suddenly."" Bangladesh might have emerged suddenly but was conceived in 1952 when Pakistan declared Urdu as its sole national language. Public protests and riots might have abated after the Bengali language was grudgingly accommodated in 1956 but Urdu imposition and Bengali resentment increased gradually. By 1971 Bangladesh was inevitable. Since then although Pakistan has tried to acknowledge Sindhi Punjabi Pashto and Balochi as provincial languages Urdu’s constitutional primacy and popular provincial aspirations have often collided violently and to this day undermine the country’s stability and strength.

While the ethnic conflict between Sinhalese and Tamils in Sri Lanka is well-known its origins are unfamiliar to outsiders. In the 1940s the political elite of both communities believed that English would be replaced by the “swabashas"" of Sinhala and Tamil after independence secured in 1948. The dream ended when Sinhala majoritarians declared theirs as the sole national language in 1956. Tamils found themselves at a disadvantage not least because the language policy hampered the life chances of the young and educated. The Sinhalese elite were perhaps not reading the news in 1971 because they adopted a new constitution in 1972 that further deprecated Tamil and minority rights. In 1976 exactly two decades after Ceylon made Sinhala the official language its Tamils raised the demand for Eelam. Civil war followed. Had it not been for this ethnic conflict Sri Lanka could have been among the Asian Tigers. It got the Tamil Tigers instead.

Elsewhere in the subcontinent language is among the mix of factors that have fuelled political conflict and chronic instability. Despite becoming a constitutional monarchy in 1990 Nepal suffered two decades of political instability and civil war. Among various causes you will find the familiar one of language imposition. At the risk of some oversimplification the dominant Pahari political elite thrust Nepali upon communities like the Maithili and Bhojpuri speakers of its southern plains. That is why post-conflict Nepal’s 2015 constitution states “all languages spoken as the mother tongues in Nepal are the languages of the nation"" and allows individual states to adopt their own official languages. If politics allows the Nepalese state to be genuinely multi-lingual it will have a better chance of prosperity.

For all its success in promoting sustainability happiness and traditional values Bhutan has a dirty secret. In the 1990s it expelled the Nepali-speaking Lhotsampa community to preserve its national identity. And while its monarchs have governed well and embraced constitutional democracy Bhutanese politicians are required to campaign in Dzongkha the national language.

An inability to reconcile ethnicity religion and language lies at the heart of the decades-old political dysfunction that has wrecked Myanmar. Like in the case of Sri Lanka the pre-independence understanding among ethnic groups was abandoned by post-independence political regimes. Bamar majoritarianism is relentless ethnic wars constant and an isolationist military regime prevails.

Let’s not forget China whose project to integrate Tibet and Xinjiang might have faced less resistance had it not been for the Han Chinese predilection to impose culture and language on the people of these regions. Beijing might accumulate wealth and power but will lack the moral legitimacy it so craves because of its hegemonic and anachronistic approach to language and culture.

Each of India’s neighbours has either come to grief or limited its potential because of the fixation with a single national language. India with much greater diversity has done better than all of them. Not because we don’t have the same pressures but because we arrived at better compromises than they have. For that reason we should not allow chauvinists and maximalists to destroy the linguistic pluralism that we have achieved. Pluralism is the magic formula that others missed. We would do well to heed the warning that the history of our neighbourhood offers us: Don’t mess with language. Doing so leads to disaster. Gradually then suddenly.

Thirty minutes of dominance.And the Mid-American Conference Tournament lacrosse championship is theirs.Central Michigan outscored Robert Morris 13-3 in the second half on Saturday to win the MAC Tourney championship game 20-10 at the CMU Lacrosse/Soccer Complex and claim the league's NCAA Tournament berth.""We've had our sights on this for a long time"" said the only coach in the seven-year history of CMU lacrosse who built the program from the ground up. ""This is what this is all about. We want to make sure that we are the MAC champions we want to go represent the MAC in the NCAA Tournament and we're going dancing.""It was the first ever MAC Tournament after the conference began sponsoring women's lacrosse in 2021. Robert Morris won the crown a year ago when there was no league tournament.CMU Robert Morris and Youngstown State shared the regular season crown in 2022 but there was no question as to which program reigned supreme on Saturday.""Every goal we made we just kept saying let's keep our foot on the gas pedal"" CMU seniorsaid. ""We did not want to let up. Robert Morris is an amazing team.""We were just feeding off of each other. We saw that open net and everybody was working together on offense.

And then Paddy scored the first two goals of the second half to make it 9-7 swinging momentum firmly to the Chippewas.CMU outscored the Colonials 8-1 in the third quarter as part of an 11-1 spurt that gave them complete control.Paddy's five-goal performance tied her career high.""I think when you see Brennan lead her team in this way it's so impressive"" Tisdale said. ""It's all over her body it's all over her face. She owns and commands the field on both sides of the ball. And once I saw her kick into gear I knew we were not going to lose this game. I'm extremely proud of all of them.

""Andis our fifth-year and we made a couple of quick adjustments and then I walked out.

The Covid-19 pandemic was a trying time for everyone including Malakai Black.

AEW star Malakai Black recently appeared on The Universal Wrestling Podcast and discussed his final few months in WWE which included navigating the pandemic in and outside of the ring.

""The first day of lockdown I'm sitting with my wife on the couch and we just did all our groceries because we're expecting...ya know we're expecting the apocalypse to basically happen and waking up in a wasteland the next morning [laughs]. I'm sitting on the couch with my wife and my wife goes 'we're in lockdown' I'm like I have no idea what this means what does it mean what are we doing? I think that state of confusion just twinkled all throughout the world and specifically into our into our world because no one knew what to do ya know? I mean everybody was just like 'what's happening?'

""The pandemic was obviously not good for me at all and I've always been told that the reason why is because Vince [McMahon] could not gauge because he didn't have an audience. We come in with this raw style but then we were guided to be smart about how the structure of like...how the match structure would like be more presented and more potent basically. That's why me and Buddy [Matthews] were like I think one of the few first...again with the Tommaso's [Ciampa] the [Johnny] Gargano's etc. that had a hybrid style of coming with that high impact indie style with the blend of traditional pro wrestling and storytelling and TV wrestling.

""I feel that's what made us stand apart because it was exciting and dynamic and it was a little bit different and then like I said when the pandemic hit I was always told the reason why the booking was the way it was is because Vince was just going 'I don't know who's over or not I don't know who's getting a good reaction I don't know because the ratings are doing all this'. I don't know he couldn't like track it and that made him really frustrated. Which is understandable because obviously prior to that I was a very well...at least maybe well is not the right word but I was in a position where I was actually being pushed more up the ladder. I really think that the pandemic era did so much damage and not just for me but for like ya know people like you and for a lot of people because it was hard all around.""

Malakai would then credit both Kevin Owens and Seth Rollins on being there for him not only whilst struggling with the pandemic but also from a lack of creative direction from WWE.

""You know I have to give a special thanks to both Seth [Rollins] and Kevin [Owens] because they held my head up high during those times of like complete confusion. Seth was also someone who was there for me with a lot of advice and a lot of like knowledge and a lot of like try this angle try that tell me about this. So if you think about your character what would you do this way what would but you know he really made think. Ya know because Seth is a lot smarter than people realize he is in this business. People like don't understand how long he's been on top because I don't care what people think. That guy's been a top player for the man for almost like a decade. He's been a high profile guy even from his NXT days he was a high profile player there to being a high profile player on the mat. He's so smart.

""The same goes for Kevin. In those last few matches right before I ya know rang the door and basically said 'boss we need to have a conversation because what the hell is happening?' Kevin would check on me every single week because he knew what was going on and he knew that it wasn't right and he knew that what was being presented and what I was promised versus what I was given would flip-flop literally every Monday and it drove me insane. Like it drove me insane because I was just like what's going on? But again reflection of that Kevin would like check on me every single week after TV or like basically go 'hey man penny for your thoughts and just know I understand that this is not the easy part' and he'd say this is the frustrating part. But ya know trying to keep my morale high but I think commonly I think we all try to keep each other's morale high because it was...yeah it was a pretty grim kind of phase in the whole universe.""

Malakai would call back to trying to make the best of a not-so-great situation and putting his all into his WrestleMania 36 match against Bobby Lashley a gesture that WWE Chairman Vince McMahon appreciated.

""I remember when Mania came and how strange it was but I still felt that ya know because I came out with the big horn jacket because I was like well it's still Mania and I'm gonna make this a goddamn Mania. Yeah I'm gonna come out with the jacket that was supposed to be seen by 80000 people so I'm still gonna wear it and ya know because I also want to I also wanted Vince to know that like you know performance center or not it was WrestleMania ya know and I wanted him to know that and we briefly spoke about that and he appreciated that I still came out with all the bells and whistles.

WrestleMania Backlash is set to go down from the Dunkin' Donuts Center in Providence Rhode Island on May 8 with plenty of interesting matchups and pairings that run back PPV showdowns from a month earlier.

There are more WrestleMania rematches at Sunday's follow-up event but one of the most anticipated bookings is entirely new. The Usos and RK-Bro have seriously elevated WWE's often neglected tag team division with their commitment to a champions vs. champions storyline. Jey and Jimmy Uso continue to perform at the top of their game while Randy Orton spits venom on the microphone and Riddle shines between the ropes. Undisputed champion Roman Reigns tossed himself into the fray only to be met by Drew McIntyre. The Bloodline has been impeccable as a trio until now. The union between McIntyre and RK-Bro has loosened The Bloodline's grip over the WWE as their six-man tag team match quickly approaches.

Plus SmackDown women's champion Charlotte Flair will take on Ronda Rousey as the two up the ante in an ""I Quit"" match. Also on the card Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins relive the former's triumphant return following a six-year stint away from the company.

Let's take a closer look at who our CBS Sports experts predict will come out on top at WWE WrestleMania Backlash which begins at 8 p.m. ET and streams live on Peacock following a kickoff show one hour earlier.

2022 WWE WrestleMania Backlash predictions

SmackDown Women's Championship -- Charlotte Flair (c) vs. Ronda Rousey (""I Quit"" Match)

WWE waited a month longer than anticipated to make the move but there seems to be little doubt Rousey will get the win here. Rousey's return has flopped with a sizable portion of the fans and the feud with Flair hasn't helped but WWE wants to get a belt back on the former UFC champion and they picked the kind of match where she can get it done even as Flair utilizes underhanded tactics to try to hold onto her title. The question becomes will Flair vs. Rousey happen again inside Hell in a Cell? Pick: Ronda Rousey wins the title -- Brent Brookhouse

It was a pleasant surprise to see Flair go over Rousey at WrestleMania 38 albeit by nefarious means. Many predicted Rousey's triumphant return at the Royal Rumble in January to translate into an immediate title run. That outcome may have only been delayed by a month but Flair got a major moment closing out WrestleMania as a consequence. The ""I Quit"" stipulation lends well to both women's submission arsenals. It is tough to imagine former UFC champion Rousey uttering those dreaded words to the dastardly Flair. Give Rousey the nod and book the rubber match. Pick: Ronda Rousey wins the title -- Shakiel Mahjouri

RK-Bro & Drew McIntyre vs. The Usos & Roman Reigns



As of the time this will go to print there are no titles on the line in this match. That could well change and the match could be for the tag belts or some sort of ""winner take all"" scenario. If no titles are on the line it seems an obvious choice to have RK-Bro and Drew McIntyre win to set up the team to challenge in title matches in the near future. It's hard to see Reigns losing if his belt is on the line even if a six-man tag with all belts up for grabs allows for a cheap out to have McIntyre pin an Uso and break up Reigns' status as undisputed champion. Still I believe this is a setup for a longer play than any titles changing hands or the tag belts being unified. Pick: RK-Bro & Drew McIntyre win -- Brookhouse

RK-Bro vs. The Usos remains one of the best feuds actively being presented in either AEW or WWE. Orton in particular has taken to the microphone with serious conviction and made the tag team titles feel as important as they have in a long time. Riddle has delivered great television matches with both Jimmy and Jey. Injecting Reigns and McIntyre into the storyline had a lot of promise at first. Reigns was the one who demanded The Usos unify the Raw and SmackDown tag team titles much like he did with the WWE and universal championships. With The Usos constantly falling short to RK-Bro Reigns would take matters into his own hands to assure The Bloodline's continued dominance. That forecast is in doubt as it appears that no titles will be contended for in this six-man tag match. A shame but the match should be solid. If WWE is going to stretch out RK-Bro vs. The Usos and Reigns vs. McIntyre to another event expect the good guys to take the nod. The Bloodline will get it back next time. Pick: RK-Bro & Drew McIntyre win -- Mahjouri

Cody Rhodes vs. Seth Rollins

There's the right thing to do and the WWE thing. The right thing is to have Rhodes win again. If you want him to come back as a star he needs to be winning matches. WWE loves to utilize 50/50 booking however which would indicate Rollins gets the win here to even things up. There is a bit of good that could come from a 1-1 series if WWE puts Rhodes and Rollins in Hell in a Cell where both men masters of ""the big match"" could truly shine. For better or worse I expect Rollins to sneak out of Backlash with a win. Pick: Seth Rollins wins -- Brookhouse

WWE appears committed to pushing Rhodes to the top. He was given an elaborate star-making entrance for his long-rumored return to the company at WrestleMania. Rollins is a tremendous performer between the ropes despite my distaste for his villainous cackling and cartoonish facial expressions. In a perfect world Rollins would not take two straight losses. Rhodes has too much momentum behind him and anything but a victory should be considered a major setback. Give the son of the son of a plumber his victory and let's keep chugging along. Pick: Cody Rhodes wins -- Mahjouri

AJ Styles vs. Edge (Damian Priest is banned from ringside)



As already mentioned in Rhodes vs. Rollins WWE loves their 50/50 booking and Styles ate the loss at WrestleMania after being distracted by the simple presence of Damian Priest -- the question of why the greatest pro wrestlers in the world are always so easily distracted is one for another time. Styles managed to beat Priest on Raw getting him banned from ringside. Styles probably gets the win here to even it up unless WWE is so in love with Edge's high school drama club theatrics in this heel persona that they just want to have him run wild possibly by introducing a third member into his alliance. Pick: AJ Styles wins -- Brookhouse

Edge's Judgement Day faction works in theory. It calls back to his time in The Brood and can be a fitting home aesthetically for Damian Priest as well as other potential initiates like Rhea Ripley. The presentation thus far has been far too hokey. It would be nice to give Styles his retribution after taking the fall at WrestleMania but it feels like WWE has invested too much in Edge's clan to erase it all right now. Damian Priest is banned from ringside so the door is wide open to officially introduce a third member. A shame for Styles one of WWE's most reliable top-level performers. Rip the Band-Aid off give Edge and his cronies the win and move on. At least Finn Balor possibly aligning with Styles is interesting. Pick: Edge wins -- Mahjouri

Bobby Lashley vs. Omos

Omos is a wrestler in the wrong era. Yes he's had a nice run in WWE but in the days of the territories he'd be the attraction moving from promotion to promotion and feuding with top stars or winning battle royals and rolling out of town. Even in the days of John Cena on top Omos would have been a valuable one or two-month feud for the Superman champion. Instead he's a guy who will probably be around for a little while longer and WWE will run out of ideas for him and he'll slowly fade away. Either way his alliance with MVP -- which is brilliant -- only works if he gets the win against Lashley at Backlash. Pick: Omos wins -- Brookhouse

This one is a tough call. Lashley defeating Omos at WrestleMania was the right call. Lashley was coming off a recent stint as WWE champion and far too experienced at a high level to lose to a relatively fresh Omos. Having MVP betray Lashley to groom the WWE's next almighty force is an interesting caveat. If MVP can shape Omos into what Lashley is that would do wonders for MVP's brand. He would arguably be WWE's most successful manager of the modern era not named Paul Heyman. Logically it is a stretch for Omos to meaningful close the competitive gap to Lashley in just one month -- with or without MVP's support. Now MVP cheating his former client out a win? That is totally believable. Omos takes the victory with an assist by MVP. Pick: Omos wins -- Mahjouri

Happy Corbin vs. Madcap Moss

How much better would this match be if it were Baron Corbin vs. Riddick Moss? Either way there's a bit of charm to Corbin vs. Moss as something of a 90s WWE midcard throwback the kind of feud that'd be blown off in a pay-per-view blindfold match second in the show's running order. Corbin has become a reliable worker and is nearly bulletproof as WWE's ""plug-him-in heel"" able to be thrown at any given babyface no matter how rarely he ever comes out on top of a feud. WWE has some belief in Moss but this is the rare spot where Corbin can be given a ""Premium Live Event"" victory. Expect him to cheat his way to victory teaching his former friend a valuable lesson. Pick: Happy Corbin wins -- Brookhouse

You would really hope that WWE is committed to elevating Moss after booking him to win the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal last month. Well five of the other seven superstars (Cesaro Big Show Mojo Rawley Matt Hardy and Braun Strowman) are no longer with the company. The promotion generally books Corbin quite strongly having him only fall to top superstars. The split between Moss and Corbin feels like a multi-match program for better or worse. Chances are Corbin takes the W on Sunday night and we see a rerun at the next major event. Pick: Happy Corbin wins -- Mahjouri",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndyZXN0bGluZ2luYy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA1L3d3ZS13cmVzdGxlbWFuaWEtYmFja2xhc2gtbGl2ZS1jb3ZlcmFnZS01LTgtZmxhaXItdnMtcm91c2V5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WWE WrestleMania Backlash Results (5/8): Flair vs. Rousey More,"WWE WrestleMania Backlash Results (5/8): Flair Vs.

Cody Rhodes defeated Seth Rollins in the dark main event after Friday's SmackDown went off the air.

After the match a young fan jumped the barricade to try and get a picture with The American Nightmare. As seen in the video below Rhodes initially seemed worried about the fan touching him from behind and immediately called for security. Rhodes asked the kid where his parents were before requesting him to return to his seat. He eventually granted the kid the picture and also shared his reaction to the video of the kid jumping the barricade as seen below.

According to PWInsder there was another incident involving a young fan at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale NY. After seeing a kid with sign noting it was his birthday Cody Rhodes wanted to bring him up to the ring. However Rhodes didn't believe he was allowed to do so but eventually said ""screw it"" and lifted the kid on the ring apron for the fans in the arena to sing Happy Birthday to close out the taping.

Cody Rhodes beat Seth Rollins after hitting three CrossRhodes in the dark main event. The RAW Superstars will lock horns in a WrestleMania 38 rematch at the upcoming WrestleMania Backlash Premium Live Event.

The RuPaul's Drag Race judge and his husband tied the knot at Almar Resort in Puerto Vallarta Mexico — the same place where the couple met two years ago. Wearing custom grooms' tuxedos from Robbie and Co. the newlyweds exchanged vows in front of 110 guests.

""It was a destination wedding"" Mathews 42 tells PEOPLE. ""So we invited 130 people thinking maybe 50 people would come. But 110 people came — and I'm thrilled!""

Because Mathews lives in Los Angeles and García in New York the couple struggled to decide where to hold the ceremony. ""It caused me such anxiety"" recalls Mathews. ""But Drew Barrymore told us 'Do it where you're supposed to do it and the people who are supposed to be there will be there.' So we chose the place where we first met.""

Not only did Barrymore come to the wedding but she agreed to be the couple's flower girl.

""I was on the The Drew Barrymore Show"" frequent guest Mathews shares. ""One day we were doing a story about weddings and she asked me 'Are you going to have a flower girl at my wedding?' And I'm like 'Why? You want the gig?' ""

""And she was like 'Oh! Are you asking me to be your flower girl?'"" he continues. ""I was like 'Do you want to be?' She goes 'Are you serious?' I'm like 'Are you serious?' And she's like 'I'm so serious.' So she's our flower girl!""

When guests arrived at the Almar Resort they received gift bags of skincare products from Mario Badescu including toner facial SPF and lip balm.

García's father represented the couple's parents as he walked both García and Mathews down the aisle. García's sister Racquel served as the pride of honor while Mathews' brother Eric was the best man. Their nephews Evan and Andrew were the ring bearers. The wedding was coordinated by celebrity wedding and event planner Michael Russo.

""The profound love shared by Ross and Wellinthon was felt by all of those in attendance at their beautiful and touching ceremony. The two exchanged heartfelt vows against the picture-perfect backdrop of an epic sunset painting the Puerto Vallarta Mexico sky"" Russo tells PEOPLE.

Mathews and García wrote their own vows. ""I wrote mine on the train into the city"" Mathews says ""and I just started to cry. It was so overwhelming thinking about all the things I wanted to say to him.""

The couple exchanged rings designed by Jean Kemanjian at OIS & Co.

After the ceremony the guests dined on bruschetta sashimi fresh fish beef salad and an assortment of vegan options. The cake — chosen by García — was red velvet. Mathews chose local artists to perform during the reception.

""I want live music"" he says. ""It was important to us to get local people to contribute to this wedding. We're there in Puerto Vallarta for a reason; we want the culture there. It'll switch to a DJ for a dance party later.""

Mathews also tells PEOPLE he wants to soak up as much time with his guests as possible.

""We'll spend a few days in Puerto Vallarta with all our guests"" he says. ""Afterwards we're going to Las Alamandas resort. It's remote just outside of Puerto Vallarta. We'll stay there for a few days.""

And after the honeymoon? ""I don't know what happens next but I know we're going to be happy"" says Mathews. ""This is the beginning of something amazing.""",,,,,,,,,,,,
RCL,Royal Caribbean Group,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZ2NhcHRhaW4uY29tL3JveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi1zaWduYWxzLXNsb3ctc3VtbWVyLWRlbWFuZC1pbi1ldXJvcGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean Signals Slow Summer Demand In Europe,"(Reuters) – Royal Caribbean Group RCL.N on Thursday flagged slow summer demand for European cruises due to the Ukraine crisis after a dull first quarter as it reeled under a resurgence in COVID infections in some parts of the world.

Shares of the cruise operator fell about 5% to $73.87 after Royal Caribbean Group said higher fuel and food costs spurred by inflationary and supply chain-related challenges are expected to weigh on 2022 earnings.

The company said while bookings for Europe sailings improved throughout the first quarter they slowed following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in late February. Cruises in the Baltic are expected to see the biggest impact.

In March Royal Caribbean joined rivals Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCLH.N and Carnival Corp CCL.N in canceling sailings to Russia and said it was removing Russian port city St. Petersburg from its upcoming itineraries.

However global booking volumes in March and April were significantly higher compared to the same period in 2019 with strong demand for North America-based itineraries.

“Recovery is clearly under way…what the shape of that (recovery) curve looks like for the balance of 2022 will depend on the health of the consumer as it relates to inflationary pressures and impacts from the Ukraine war” said M Science analyst Michael Erstad.

The decision by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to remove COVID-19 notice against cruise travel in March almost two years after introducing a warning scale is expected to boost growth for cruise companies after a long period of minimal business.

Royal Caribbean Group’s revenue rose to $1.06 billion in the first quarter from $42.01 million a year earlier but missed analysts’ average estimate of $1.15 billion according to IBES Refinitiv data.

Excluding items it posted a loss of $4.57 per share compared with estimates for a loss of $4.47.

I'm not going to screw that up’ Treacy told Seatrade Cruise onboard the fifth Oasis-class ship as it completed a two-day sailing for trade partners before its maiden European cruise departing Barcelona May 8.

‘We've got a big job to do with Icon of the Seas’ he added in reference to Royal Caribbean’s LNG-powered vessel entering the market in 2023 ‘It's going to be the first time we’ve launched a new class of ship in over a decade. That's a big job for us to do and we're very excited.’

‘Never say never’ to Chinese market

‘I would never say never’ said Bouldin when it comes to Wonder of the Seas sailing in China. Pre-pandemic the ship had been announced for Shanghai.

‘We know the UK is a particularly strong market: Anthem [of the Seas] is pretty much sold for the summer…’ he added in relation to sailings from the Port of Southampton this year. ‘I think the focus in the next five to six months is going be on our fly-cruise offer. But we're always evaluating what the right deployment is for the UK market. Michael Bailey recently announced that Icon of the Seas is going to stop in Southampton… so lots of exciting things coming down the line. We'll see what happens.’

Bouldin expects a large portion of Royal Caribbean’s growth to be realized in Europe the Middle East and Africa and as a result said ‘it's going to be really important that we build competence in fly-cruise.’

He went on to add that the balance of Americans flying to Europe versus customers being sourced locally is 'uncertain.' He explained 'My team's goal is very much on sourcing as much locally as we possibly can. We've got to figure out how we can fly more effectively for markets like Germany Italy France as well as continuing to ensure we can meet demand in the UK Ireland and some of our bigger markets...

'I think by the end of May we will have all of the ships in our fleet back in service. And we are laser focused on making sure that we're able to welcome all of our guests back successfully.’

Latin America

Latin America is another region Royal Caribbean will seek to nurture according to Treacy. Said the SVP who brings 16 years’ experience working at Royal Caribbean ‘Latin America is a key strategic region for us. Vacationers in Latin America like to go to the Caribbean and South Florida where we have more than 10 ships operating. We're very interested in growing the Latin American market and we're investing in that.

‘We've just recently announced an exciting expansion plan in Latin America with Rhapsody of the Seas. Rhapsody is going to be sailing in winter 2023-24 out of Panama and Cartagena and that's very much focused on the Latin American market… That's a big new investment in Latin America and hopefully we can expand from there.’

Support for travel trade

Addressing trade partners who previewed the world’s largest cruise ship from May 6-8 prior to its Barcelona and Civitavecchia (Rome) cruises Treacy said ‘Our support for the trade is never dying. We recognise the majority of our business comes from trade the advocacy we get from trade is tremendous it's a big part of our comeback story.'

He went on ‘We have seen business come back a little faster than through trade because so many of you are restarting your businesses but it's very exciting to see volume from trade come back. It's an essential part of our distribution strategy.’

In the past six to nine months Royal Caribbean has started to spend more ‘aggressively’ Bouldin said including on television advertising and marketing across Europe. ‘We have boosted commission. From a base commission earnings perspective we've also boosted targeted earning potential.’ In the UK Ireland and Northern Ireland the company is spending an extra 5-8% on average on commission versus 2019.

For the first time in more than two years entire fleets are back sailing there are also cancellations and ship changes.

We have a major cruise news update for you across all the major cruise lines including the cancellation of a regular sailing for Norwegian Prima two new developments related to the world’s largest cruise ship an update by the CDC Royal Caribbean deployment changes Carnival Cruise Line becoming the first major cruise line to have the entire fleet back in service and while we’re on that topic all Norwegian Cruise Line ships will be back sailing with guests today!

Royal Caribbean Ship Changes

We already knew that Voyager of the Seas was not going to be offering sailings in Northern Europe but now Royal Caribbean has confirmed that the ship will be based out of Fort Lauderdale in Florida instead starting from May 6 2023.

Voyager of the Seas was originally scheduled to offer cruises from Copenhagen Denmark and Stockholm Sweden starting May 21 2023. The cruise line has been sending out communication updates regarding the deployment change over the past week.

Instead Serenade of the Seas will take Voyager‘s place with similar itineraries sailing from Copenhagen on Northern European and Scandinavian voyages.

Serenade of the Seas was previously scheduled to sail from Barcelona beginning in May 2023 but is instead taking over Voyager of the Seas‘ Northern European and Scandinavian itineraries. The ship’s fall 2023 deployment and itineraries have not yet been announced.

Guests who were initially booked on Voyager of the Seas will automatically be moved to the identical replacement sailing aboard Serenade of the Seas. Like-for-like stateroom categories will be protected as will guests’ original cruise fare rates.

The CDC has further updated its voluntary program for cruise ships which all the major cruise lines that operate in the U.S. are following. In the change made on May 5 2022 CDC now says “Changed cruise ship vaccination status thresholds from 95% of passengers to 90% of passengers.“

Changing the threshold down to 90% allows cruise lines operating under “highly vaccinated” voyages to allow more unvaccinated guests to sail. Currently all the cruise lines opting into the CDC’s program are under “Highly Vacctined” sailings including Carnival Cruise Line Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line.

Previously the threshold was 95% for unvaccinated guests. The threshold remains the same at 95% when it comes to the crew members.

In addition to lowering the threshold for vaccinated passengers the CDC also changed its guidance on isolation onboard cruise ships. Isolation rooms onboard are no longer required to have negative pressure but the locations must still be predesignated. Guests are exempt from being isolated in the cabin within 36 hours of disembarkation.

It has been a busy week of news for the world’s largest cruise ship Royal Caribbean’s Wonder of the Seas. The ship finished its eastbound transatlantic crossing from Fort Lauderdale in Florida and is starting 7-night sailings in the western Mediterranean.

From May 8 through October 30 Wonder of the Seas will bring eager guests to sought-after destinations in Italy France and Spain. Embarkations can be from either Barcelona Spain or from Italy.

Wonder of the Seas will depart Barcelona for the last time on October 30 to begin a 14-night transatlantic crossing to reposition to her new permanent homeport Port Canaveral in Florida.

And more news on the mega-ship Royal Caribbean has started the search on the social media platform TikTok for the godmother. Using the #SearchForWonderMom hashtag a contest is running to search for the Wonder Mom through Monday May 16 2022. The cruise line will then announce the winner to become the ship’s godmother this summer.

The naming ceremony will be held this December. The event will take place when the ship is in her new homeport of Port Canaveral Florida. The godmother and her family will also be on the exclusive sailing from Port Canaveral to Royal Caribbean’s private island of Perfect Day at CococoCay in the Bahamas.

It will get even better for the Wonder Mom as the family will enjoy a seven-night Caribbean sailing on Wonder of the Seas and stay in the Ultimate Family Suite first-class flights and three nights in a five-star hotel before the cruise begins. There will also be $1000 of spending money.

All Carnival Cruise Ships Back in Service

As Carnival Splendor welcomed her first guests for the first time in over two years on May 2 the full Carnival Cruise Line fleet has now returned to service for the first time since the industry-wide shutdown began in March 2020.

The Carnival Splendor became the final ship in the fleet to return to service when she departed from Smith Cove Cruise Terminal 91 in Seattle Washington on May 2.

This initial cruise is an 8-day roundtrip sailing that will visit top Alaskan ports of call – Skagway Juneau Icy Strait Point and Ketchikan – as well as Victoria British Columbia.

Carnival Splendor will continue offering Alaska sailings from Seattle through the end of August though only this first sailing is an 8-night itinerary. The rest of the ship’s itineraries will be 7-night sailings.

With Carnival Splendor‘s official restart the full Carnival fleet is finally back in service. And it’s the first major cruise line to do so. Carnival Vista was the very first Carnival cruise ship to restart passenger operations when she set sail on July 3 2021 from Galveston Texas.

Over the past 10 months Carnival Cruise Line has operated a gradual phased restart bringing ships back into service one at a time as various ports of call have reopened for travelers.

All Norwegian Cruise Line Ships Back in Service

For the first time in more than two years the entire Norwegian Cruise Line fleet is back in service! NCL now becomes the second major cruise line to have all cruise ships back with guests.

The final ship in the NCL fleet sets sail today May 7 from Tahiti in French Polynesia. The 75904 gross ton Norwegian Spirit sails on a 12-night cruise visiting some of the most stunning islands in the Pacific. She becomes the final ship in the fleet to resume guest operations after more than two years on hold.

Norwegian Spirit will sail the same itinerary three times before repositioning to Vancouver Canada to start her season in Alaska.

Norwegian Jade became the first ship in the fleet to resume guest operations on July 25 2021 out of Athens Greece. Since then more vessels have gradually been returning to service and that’s despite some setbacks from the Omicron variant towards the end of 2021 and early 2022.

Norwegian Prima Cruise Canceled Due to Charter

Norwegian Cruise Line informed booked guests and travel partners in the past week that the January 22 2023 sailing of Norwegian Prima from Port Canaveral has been canceled due to a full ship charter sailing on that date.

The affected sailing is the 7-night sailing of what will soon be Norwegian Cruise Line’s newest ship Norwegian Prima.

The cruise was to have been a Western Caribbean and Bahamas voyage scheduled to visit Cozumel Costa Maya and Grand Cayman as well as the cruise line’s private island in The Bahamas Great Stirrup Cay. Two days at sea were also part of the itinerary.

At this time Norwegian Prima will still be sailing the itinerary as planned but the voyage is no longer available for public booking as it has been reserved for a private full ship charter.

Already-booked guests will automatically receive a full refund of all monies paid including the cruise fare pre-paid gratuities or packages taxes and fees.

Perched against the backdrop of wild Alaska the Ketchikan harbor is deep enough that cruise ships can dock right downtown making disembarking and exploring this jewel of a town easy and accessible.

Mollie Breese is a local Alaskan resident who has spent many summers exploring the wilds of Alaska. Currently residing on Kodiak Island she spends her weekends exploring new trails remote villages and her next favorite local brewery. She has travelled extensively throughout Southeastern Alaska the Aleutian Islands and along the road system of central Alaska.

Downtown Ketchikan looks just like the front of a postcard with its brightly colored homes tucked cozily along boardwalks. This town is the “gateway to Southeast Alaska” and the self-proclaimed Salmon Capital of the World. While there is much to explore within the downtown area cruise ship passengers also can take advantage of the endless wilds of the Tongass National Forest just beyond the town’s boundary.

A visitor could spend weeks exploring everything Ketchikan has to offer. Unfortunately Alaska is a big place and there is much more to see along your voyage. Many cruise ship passengers may only have a day to explore this historic stop.

So we’ve done the hard work and provided a line-up of the top things to do for a day in beautiful Ketchikan Alaska. This list stays away from overpacked or overhyped stops focusing on experiences that encompass the beauty serenity and adventure that Ketchikan offers. While some of these attractions may appear on other travel sites we’ve taken the extra step to provide you with a local perspective on visiting this island during your Alaska cruise.

Walk Along Creek Street

Located just off Main Street Creek Street is one of the most photographed spots in Southeast Alaska. Meandering along a cascading creek (hence the name) the Creek Street boardwalk is a favorite for tourists and locals. Formerly the Red Light District this boardwalk is now home to colorful homes historic totem poles local art and tourism shops cafes restaurants and the Dolly’s House Museum. These attractions make it one of the best places to shop in town. If you’re looking for a gift for those back home check out the Fish Creek Company. This is a great stop for quirky Alaskan souvenirs and quality products.

Starting in May Creek Street is also one of the best places to view the salmon run with various salmon species surging upstream in the crystal clear water as they head to their spawning zones. This run draws an array of eagles otters and seals. Visitors can look over the boardwalk railings to see a real-life display of wild Alaska.

While the Creek Street boardwalk is level and an easy walk if you are looking for a more strenuous experience then head up the Married Man’s Trail at the end of Creek Street. This extension is rumored to be the hidden path that married men used to take when attempting to visit the brothels along the boardwalk “discreetly.” Today the path is a wooden staircase that extends up to Park Avenue where walkers can get a higher vista of the town.

If you do this extra leg of the journey be sure to check out the Salmon Ladder at the end of Married Man’s Trail. At this point of the creek the water turns into a rushing cascade and you can watch salmon attempt to jump over the waterfall as they continue upstream.

Depending on how much you shop and hike plan to spend anywhere from 1-2 hours exploring the Creek Street area.

Visit the Tongass Historical Museum

The Tongass Historical Museum is one of the best displays of native Alaskan history in Southeast Alaska. Located off of Creek Street this stop can be combined with the boardwalk to fill up an entire morning.

The Tongass Historical Museum is partnered with the Totem Heritage Center. Both museums offer an engaging educational experience. However the Tongass Historical Museum is more centrally located in the downtown area making it easier to visit when on a time restraint. While a fast visit can last about 20 minutes if you take your time to appreciate each exhibit then visitors can easily spend an hour learning here.

Exhibits cover the long and fascinating history of the inhabitants of Revillagigedo Island (where Ketichand is located). Visitors can learn about Tlingit history and culture as well as the evolution of the town from a fishing port to the sixth-largest town in Alaska. Be sure to check out their homepage for current exhibits and any special events!

After your visit head west down Dock Street to the 55North Bakery one of the best places to grab a coffee and a delicious sweet bakery treat!

Go for a Hike in a Rainforest

Ketchikan sits in the heart of the Tongass National Forest the largest national forest in the United States. This temperate rainforest is full of lush ferns rare flora and towering trees. For any lover of the Pacific Northwest you will be right at home in the acres of moss-covered trails set against the backdrop of mountains and glacier bays.

While cruise ships do offer excursions to visit this wilderness visitors can also access trails straight from downtown. Just off of 3rd Avenue is the Rainbird Hiking Trail. This 2-mile trail is a popular hiking trail for visitors and offers amazing views of the inlet and town. The trail is rated as moderate on AllTrails with a 541-foot elevation gain. While rocks and roots can make the trail difficult to navigate the views and scenery make hikers feel like they are deep in the Tongass Forest.

Keep an eye out for local wildlife including black bears eagles foxes and ermine as they can be frequent visitors along this trail and on the outskirts of the town.

Catch a Fishing Charter to Fill Your Freezer

Ketchikan is known as the Salmon Capital of the World and it is a title well-earned by the masses of salmon that surge upstream from mid-May to September. However Ketchikan is home to more than just salmon. Pacific Halibut Yelloweye Rockfish and a variety of pacific cod species are also common in these waters.

If you’re looking to try your hand at Alaskan fishing booking a fishing charter for your day in Ketchikan is a great opportunity. While you can rent fishing gear in town to fish along the town streams a charter provides all the gear optional fish packing/shipping and a knowledgeable captain to take you to the best spots. A fishing charter also offers the added benefit of enjoying the scenic Tongass shoreline from the water and the chance to get close to whales orcas and dolphins. If you’re trying to decide between fishing or a whale-watching cruise a charter can combine both options. If you want to keep your catch charters offer fish packing and mailing at an additional price allowing you to ship your fish home and enjoy it for months to come.

There are a wide variety of charters available to book in Ketchikan. To get one of the best prices book your charter a couple of months out from your cruise arrival date. With Ketchikan being one of the most popular ports of call in Alaska the best charters can fill up quickly and other charters can raise their prices.

Most charters are around 4-6 hours. Plan to bring plenty of layers waterproof clothing/boots bug spray and your camera. For recommendation Oasis Alaska Charters offers a variety of fishing excursions including King Salmon fishing.

Important Note: You will need to purchase a fishing license (with a salmon stamp if you plan on salmon fishing) prior to your fishing day. You can purchase your license online at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game website. Try and purchase your license at least a month before your departure date to ensure time for processing and mailing. You can also purchase a license in Alaska at any outfitter store though this will take time away from your time on the water.

Take a Scenic Ride to Misty Fjords National Monument

Misty Fjords National Monument is not a local’s secret in Ketchikan. In fact a quick Google search will show that this is a top favorite for most travel sites. But this high status is definitely earned.

Misty Fjords National Monument combines everything that is beautiful about the wilderness of Southeast Alaska. A trip to Misty Fjords guarantees vistas filled with towering peaks glacial lakes sea cliffs plunging waterfalls and lush rainforests. Unlike some of the passages frequented by cruise ships during your days at sea small cruise vessels and kayak tours allow visitors to fully explore these narrow fjord channels. In the summer the fjord echoes with the calls of migrating birds sea lions seals whales and soaring eagles.

To visit this area visitors have a variety of options. You can take a small cruise that travels along the passage typically about 2-3 hours long. You can also opt for a private kayak tour that will paddle along the shoreline with the chance to spot bears and other wildlife. For a fancier option floatplane charters also depart daily from Ketchikan offering priceless views of the Tongass National Forest Misty Fjords National Monument and the picturesque islands spanning off into the horizon.

Regardless of how you choose to spend your day in Ketchikan Alaska you are guaranteed to enjoy it. This makes it one of the top stops to enjoy on your Great Alaskan Journey! Bon voyage!

Princess Cruises could be your line.

The California-based brand was a pioneer in adding a large number of balcony cabins to ships and even its oldest vessels are loaded with balcony cabins — something that can't be said for many of its rivals.

On the flip side Princess offers relatively few suites on its ships compared to some of the big-ship lines with which it most directly competes including Celebrity Cruises Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean. Just 46 of the 1830 rooms on the line's recently unveiled Discovery Princess are suites for instance. Believe it or not that's an improvement from earlier vessels in the same series some of which have as few as 36 suites.

For more cruise guides news and tips sign up for TPG's cruise newsletter.

Princess also isn't known for enormous and amenity-filled suites.

What this means is there aren't a lot of ways to live large on a Princess ship or pack a lot of people into a single accommodation. Until the debut of Sky Princess in 2019 the line didn't have a single cabin that could accommodate more than four people.

That said on Princess ships you can often create larger living spaces by booking two connecting cabins.

A Princess Cruises cabin primer

As is typical for many cruise ships Princess vessels offer cabins in four broad categories: Windowless ""inside"" cabins ocean-view cabins balcony cabins and suites.

As noted above a significant portion of cabins on all Princess ships are balcony cabins — the category of cabin that everyone wants these days. About 80% of the 1834 cabins on Princess's six-month-old Enchanted Princess are balcony cabins or suites with balconies for instance. Compare that to the 72% of cabins on Royal Caribbean's four-year-old Symphony of the Seas that are balcony cabins or suites with balconies.

Notably every single cabin facing the sea on three of the newest Princess ships — Royal Princess Regal Princess and Majestic Princess — has a balcony. These three vessels are completely devoid of ocean-view cabins (cabins facing the sea that only have a window). That's relatively unusual in the world of big mass-market ships — the niche of cruising in which Princess plays. It's more common with luxury cruise vessels.

Related: The ultimate guide to Princess Cruises ships

At the same time as noted above Princess vessels have fewer suites than you'll find on the ships operated by such big-ship brands as Royal Caribbean and Celebrity.

Here's a breakdown of the broad cabin categories on Royal Princess which is typical of the line's newer ships (it's the prototype vessel for the line's new six-ship Royal Class series):

Inside cabins: 342 (19%)

Ocean-view cabins: 0 (0%)

Balcony cabins (including mini-suites): 1402 (79%)

Suites: 36 (2%)

On older Princess ships (and in general all older cruise ships) there are fewer balcony cabins. However the ratio of balcony cabins to non-balcony cabins is much higher on older Princess ships than it is on older vessels at many other big-ship lines. An impressive 72% of the 1000 cabins on Princess's 2003-built Coral Princess for instance are balcony cabins.

On Coral Princess inside cabins and ocean-view cabins only make up 26% of all rooms. A breakdown of the cabin categories on that ship:

Inside cabins: 108 (11%)

Ocean-view cabins: 157 (16%)

Balcony cabins (including mini-suites): 719 (72%)

Suites: 16 (2%)

The takeaway here is that you'll have an easier time locking down a balcony cabin on a Princess ship — even an older Princess ship — than you will when booking many of the ships operated by competing big-ship lines.

Just note that you'll want to book early if you're aiming for a suite on a Princess ship since there are so few of them. Note also that suites tend to sell out early on cruise ships in general. An old saying in the cruise industry is that ""ships sell from the top and the bottom."" That is the first cabins on any vessel to sell out are the most expensive cabins which are the suites and then the least expensive cabins which typically are the inside cabins. The mid-priced ""middle"" cabins sell last.

Design-wise Princess's cabins and suites are fairly basic and comfortable if not super stylish.

When it comes to rooms Princess is sort of the Marriott of the big-ship cruise world. Its rooms are comfortable and functional but a bit bland. Avant-garde style is not a Princess thing.

Inside cabins on Princess Cruises ships

These are the cabins you stay in when you're on a tight budget. On any Princess ship they are almost always the least-expensive option when you're booking a cabin. You often can save considerable money by booking an inside cabin versus an ocean-view or higher-level cabin.

What you'll give up of course is that ocean view. Your room will have four walls and no windows offering a glimpse of the outside world.

You'll also be in a relatively small room. The typical inside cabin on the new Discovery Princess measures 166 square feet with some as big as 175 square feet. By comparison the typical balcony cabin on Discovery Princess measures 181 square feet not including a 41-square-foot balcony (for a total of 222 square feet).

Still the inside cabins on Princess ships are bigger than the inside cabins on ships operated by some of the line's main competitors.

Inside cabins on Royal Caribbean's Symphony of the Seas for instance measure just 149 square feet — quite a bit less than the inside cabins on Discovery Princess.

Note that older Princess ships sometimes have smaller inside cabins than newer Princess ships. On the line's 2003-built Coral Princess inside cabins measure just 156 to 166 square feet. On the line's 1998-built Grand Princess most inside cabins are 160 square feet (some wheelchair-accessible inside cabins on Grand Princess measure 182 square feet).

Many inside cabins on Princess ships have pull-down bunks that will allow for up to four people to stay in the rooms.

Ocean-view cabins on Princess Cruises ships

With an ocean-view cabin you get a window looking out to the sea but not an attached balcony where you can sit outside and enjoy the fresh air.

As noted above three of Princess's newest vessels — Royal Princess Regal Princess and Majestic Princess — don't have a single ocean-view cabin. Every outward-facing cabin has a balcony. However you'll find ocean-view cabins on the line's older vessels and also on the line's three newest ships Discovery Princess Enchanted Princess and Sky Princess.

In general ocean-view cabins on the Princess ships that have them are a tad bigger than the inside cabins found on the same vessels. On the line's Emerald Princess for instance the typical ocean-view cabin measures 178 square feet. The typical inside cabin on Emerald Princess measures 163 square feet.

On many Princess ships that have ocean-view cabins the rooms are mostly found just above the promenade deck where the lifeboats hang and have obstructed views. You'll also sometimes find a few ocean-view cabins at the back of Princess vessels facing the wake.

On the line's two Coral Class ships — Coral Princess and Island Princess — there are a few ""premium"" ocean-view cabins that measure a more spacious 212 square feet. If you're the kind of traveler who needs a lot of space these rooms can be a good choice.

There also are a handful of ""premium"" ocean-view cabins on the new Discovery Princess Enchanted Princess and Sky Princess that measure 172 square feet and have unusual slanting windows.

Balcony cabins on Princess Cruises ships

Balcony cabins are what everyone wants these days and Princess is delivering with huge numbers of balcony cabins on all its newest ships. On the line's new Royal Class series of ships which began debuting in 2013 nearly 80% of rooms are balcony cabins.

On these newer vessels — Royal Princess Regal Princess Majestic Princess Sky Princess Enchanted Princess and Discovery Princess — the typical balcony cabin has an interior space of 181 square feet plus a balcony that measures 41 square feet (for a total of 222 square feet). However there also are bigger ""premium deluxe balcony"" cabins that can measure as much as 233 square feet on the inside (not including the balcony). Some of these have larger-than-normal balconies that can stretch the total square footage to 312 square feet.

In addition the Royal Class vessels have even larger balcony cabins that Princess calls mini-suites. Including their balcony space these cabins measure anywhere from 299 to 329 square feet. While these mini-suite cabins have the word ""suite"" in their name we are including them in the balcony cabin category as they generally resemble very large balcony cabins vs. true suites.

The typical Princess balcony cabin has twin beds that can be converted into a queen bed a built-in desk with a chair and a built-in miniature refrigerator. In addition to beds a desk and a miniature fridge premium balcony cabins have a seating area with a sofa bed that can be used for a third passenger in the room. Some also have a pull-down bunk that can accommodate a fourth person.

Suites on Princess Cruises ships

As mentioned above Princess ships generally have fewer suites than the ships operated by some of its biggest competitors. The line also isn't known for particularly giant suites.

Princess's three newest ships — Discovery Princess Enchanted Princess and Sky Princess — have the line's first truly large standalone suites dubbed Sky Suites. There are two of them on each of the vessels and they measure a generous 1792 square feet (though more than half of that space is taken up by a huge wraparound balcony). With two bedrooms plus a living room with a pullout sofa the Sky Suites are the first Princess accommodations designed for up to five people.

Still even the Sky Suites on Discovery Princess Enchanted Princess and Sky Princess aren't the sort of truly epic suites with huge interior living spaces that you'll find on the latest ships from such competitors as Celebrity and Royal Caribbean. The latest Celebrity vessels for instance offer so-called Iconic Suites that have twice as much interior space as the Sky Suites.

If you're the kind of cruiser who is only happy in a cabin of truly giant proportions (and are willing to pay up for it) Princess probably isn't your line.

Still you'll find at least a few suites of a decent size on every Princess ship. The line's seven Grand Class vessels each offer two ""family suites"" at their fronts that can be created by connecting a mini-suite with an adjacent inside cabin to create a six- to eight-person complex.

Each of the line's Royal Class ships (the line's six newest ships) has at least 36 suites.

Bottom line

Princess offers a relatively wide range of cabins on its ships including lots of the sort of cabins that everyone wants — balcony cabins. If you're a fan of balcony cabins you'll find plenty of options on Princess ships including standard size balcony cabins and bigger ""premium"" balcony cabins. You'll also find a lot of larger ""mini-suite"" balcony cabins on Princess ships. However you won't find a lot of truly large suites with multiple rooms.

If Japan’s Best Car can be believed Toyota thinks so and it’s dusted off the circa 2015 Toyota S-FR concept for production with the help of Daihatsu and Suzuki—two small car specialists the former of which is a Toyota subsidiary. Do we want to believe?

Of course we love the MX-5; we are enthusiasts who love sporty cars and Toyota’s no stranger to the segment. The last car it built in this class was the MR-2 Spyder a nominal Miata competitor that appealed to the quirkier and more hardcore enthusiasts. It had less curb appeal and more “budget Elise” mojo. But the S-FR (well the concept which is old) has one thing the MR2 Spyder doesn’t: undeniable cuteness. Rather than an amphibian shape made out of Duplos the S-FR is funky and organic—more Kermit and less Kerbal.

Forbes’ Japan-based reporter put hands on the exclusive Best Car report and from this we understand that the appeal of shared development costs and partner automakers is what makes the revival feasible. Well rumored revival. The evidence is thin to be clear. The Daihatsu Vision Copen apparently previews the bones of a future S-FR and seems an appropriate basis; the windshield surround and the doors look very S-FR. It’s rounded and cute. Toyota-izing it would be a simple task.

After all if Daihatsu is making a small convertible already it wouldn’t be difficult for Toyota to create a larger more powerful version at a different price point. Bringing in Suzuki’s small engine expertise would help reduce costs as well. Consider the BMW underpinnings of the latest Supra and the co-development of the GR86 and the Subaru BRZ. Toyota has signaled it won’t build a sports car without some aspect of it being shared or already in existence.

Best Car pegs the upcoming S-FR to debut in 2026 or 2027 with tweaked styling but a similar overall vibe to the 2015 S-FR concept and a 150-hp 1.3-liter turbo I-3 engine under the hood.

Plausible? Maybe. Probable? That’s another story entirely. And as for the U.S. market don't expect a Daihatsu-based anything to make it here; besides Toyota has the GR86 already which is essentially a roofed Miata fighter.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9zZi9hcnRpY2xlL3MtZi12YWxlbmNpYS1zdHJlZXQtYmljeWNsZS1sYW5lLTE5NDQyMjcyLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,S.F.'s Valencia Street merchants endorse replacing center bikeway with protected side-running lanes,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/s-f-valencia-street-bicycle-lane-19442272.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9zZi9hcnRpY2xlL3MtZi12YWxlbmNpYS1zdHJlZXQtYmljeWNsZS1sYW5lLTE5NDQyMjcyLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vUG9saXRpY3MvcmZrLWpycy1jbGV2ZXItbW92ZS1lYXJuLWJhbGxvdC1hY2Nlc3MtbmF0aW9ud2lkZS9zdG9yeT9pZD0xMDk4NzIxOTfSAWhodHRwczovL2FiY25ld3MuZ28uY29tL2FtcC9Qb2xpdGljcy9yZmstanJzLWNsZXZlci1tb3ZlLWVhcm4tYmFsbG90LWFjY2Vzcy1uYXRpb253aWRlL3N0b3J5P2lkPTEwOTg3MjE5Nw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RFK Jr.'s 'clever move' to help earn ballot access nationwide: Allying with little-known parties,"""You usually don't see this kind of coordination and effort"" one expert said.

One Saturday last month several dozen members of the Alaskan Independence Party a small largely unknown political group whose primary goal is to put Alaskan secession from the United States to a vote gathered in Fairbanks for their biennial convention.

Among the topics of conversation: whether to nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for president.

The party ultimately rejected Kennedy who is running as an independent after a few outspoken members said they did not want him atop their 2024 ticket according to John Howe the party's chairman who was involved in the discussions.

""There was serious consideration"" Howe a machine shop owner told ABC News.

The decision to pass on Kennedy was seen as a blow to the candidate -- ""They wanted us to put him on the ballot"" Howe said -- as Kennedy works to overcome the biggest obstacle to his plans to run as a major outside candidate in November: getting on the ballot across the country.

Typically independent candidates must undergo the painstaking expensive process of gathering thousands of signatures from registered voters in each state in order to qualify for ballot access.

But a candidate can bypass those requirements if a political party that already has ballot access in a given state nominates them to lead their ticket there.

Kennedy has successfully employed that strategy in Michigan and California where he will technically appear on the ballot as the nominee for the Natural Law Party of Michigan and the American Independent Party of California.

What's more his campaign has been in contact with minor parties in at least six other states too ABC News has learned through conversations with leaders in more than a dozen minor parties across the country. (The Kennedy campaign did not return requests for comment for this story or respond to the details that the party leaders provided.)

""As the campaign sees and recognizes that these are very convenient vessels out there it's a clever move and it's not a surprise they do it"" Derek Muller a University of Notre Dame professor specializing in election law told ABC News.

Early polling of the 2024 race suggests Kennedy could take a notable amount of support in a close race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden the two leading candidates -- if Kennedy makes it on the ballot. A new ABC News/Ipsos survey of adults found Kennedy with 12% in a hypothetical five-way election with Trump Biden and two other candidates Cornel West and Jill Stein.

Kennedy's campaign claims to have made it on the ballot in 10 states so far including the battlegrounds of Michigan Nevada and North Carolina. Elections offices in three states have confirmed to ABC News that Kennedy is on the ballot. In other states officials have said they can't yet confirm his candidacy.

Kennedy's strategy of linking with minor parties has encountered both challenges and success. In some cases like Alaska the parties have rejected him while in others they are actively speaking with his campaign about nominating him.

His campaign tried and failed to earn the nomination of the Unity Party of Colorado which chose instead to back West another independent candidate Tijani Cole the party's chairman told ABC News in an email.

The Alliance Party a national group with ballot access in South Carolina has been more receptive.

""National Alliance Party leadership has begun early conversations with the campaign for potential mutual support"" Phil Feuhrer the party's national co-vice chair told ABC News in an email.

Besides nominating Kennedy to lead the party’s ticket in South Carolina Feuhrer said the party is discussing helping the Kennedy campaign gather signatures across Minnesota to appear as an independent candidate there.

""If we reach full agreement with the campaign and our internal statewide leadership teams it would include placement onto the South Carolina ballot as well as the Minnesota Independence-Alliance taking lead on placing the campaign onto the Minnesota ballot"" Feuhrer added using the official name of Minnesota's branch of the party.

""Those conversations are young and still ongoing"" he said.

Kennedy's camp is also in talks with the Reform Party which has ballot access in Florida and Mississippi according to party leaders.

Jenniffer Desatoff the party's Florida chair told ABC News they are ""continuing communication with the Kennedy campaign at this time."" (Kennedy's campaign also contacted the Ecology Party of Florida but was informed the party does not have a ballot line in the presidential race the party's chair Cara Campbell told ABC News.)

Elsewhere the Kennedy campaign twice reached out to representatives of the Constitution Party which has ballot access in nearly a dozen states but the party and the campaign were never able to connect Donna Ivanovich a spokeswoman for the party told ABC News.

Meanwhile Kennedy has formed a party of its own We the People to secure ballot access in several states including in Delaware Hawaii and North Carolina. In those states the signature threshold to make the ballot is lower for candidates aligned with a party than for independent candidates.

Although other independent candidates ally with minor parties for ballot access -- like West is also doing in the 2024 race -- the breadth and ""coordination"" of Kennedy's effort stands out said Muller the Notre Dame election law expert.

""You usually don't see this kind of coordination and effort because the candidacies are usually not serious enough to make the outreach to all these parties in all these different states"" he told ABC News.

But by aligning himself with small often niche parties Kennedy risks absorbing the burden of their sometimes checkered history some observers warned.

The American Independent Party of California which nominated Kennedy last month had backed George Wallace the former Alabama governor and notorious segregationist in the 1960s.

In a video announcing his nomination Kennedy acknowledged the party's past support for Wallace but said it ""has had its own rebirth even before I came along.""

""It's been reborn as a party that represents not bigotry and hatred but rather compassion unity idealism and common sense"" he said.

Another problem with wooing minor parties is that Kennedy's beliefs sometimes don't align with theirs.

The members of the Alaskan Independence Party who rejected Kennedy as the party's nominee were wary he would agree with them on their view that government-owned land should be given back to Alaskans Howe the party chairman told ABC News.

But Kennedy's chances at winning the nomination may have sunk days before the convention when he failed to win over the previous chair of the Alaskan Independence Party Bob Bird in a radio interview with Bird.

""The AIP will not be placing RFK on the ballot"" Bird wrote in a column after the interview casting Kennedy as an outsider.

""Our liberty and prosperity must come from within ourselves"" Bird wrote ""not from a knight galloping in from the Lower 48.""

Chilton Named 21st President of the University of New Hampshire,"Following a national search Elizabeth S. Chilton a native of the Northeast who most recently served as chancellor of Washington State University’s Pullman campus has been appointed the 21st president of the University of New Hampshire effective July 1 2024.

Chilton will succeed James W. Dean Jr. who is retiring after six years leading UNH. She was appointed the inaugural chancellor of Washington State’s Pullman campus in 2022 after joining WSU in 2020 as provost and executive vice president of the WSU system.

“UNH is a leading public university with strong student outcomes a large and diverse research portfolio and dedication to the state of New Hampshire and I am honored and humbled to have the opportunity to serve as president of this incredible institution” Chilton says. “I’ve long admired UNH’s history vibrant and engaged community and commitment to student success and scholarship. I look forward to returning to the Northeast to join the Wildcat family and help UNH serve our students and society in pursuit of a prosperous future.”

WSU Pullman is the system’s flagship and Washington State’s land grant university serving about 18000 students. Prior to becoming chancellor her role as chief academic officer included oversight of research functions across the six-campus system a role she continued in while serving as chancellor for the last two years.

A first-generation college student and a graduate of public universities Chilton is a champion for public higher education deeply committed to access and liberal arts education. She values UNH’s unique position as a leading public research institution that maintains a sharp focus on undergraduate education inspired by the university’s research mission while also remaining a strong believer in the power of a transformational undergraduate experience.

“Dr. Chilton has shown tremendous leadership and strategic vision across the academic and research enterprise and her career is a testament to the mission of public higher education” said Jamie Burnett ‘95 ‘96G ‘98G the vice-chair of the University System of New Hampshire Board of Trustees and chair of the presidential search committee. “She cares deeply about the student experience and is committed to advancing student success at UNH. She has a record of collaboration lifting up her peers building partnerships and creating opportunities. The UNH community and the state should have a high degree of confidence in Elizabeth’s appointment.”

Chilton’s appointment concludes a search launched last fall after Dean announced his intention to retire. A 16-member search committee comprised of representatives of the Board of Trustees faculty staff and students across UNH’s three campuses led the search.

Chilton will visit all three UNH campuses from May 9 to 11. She will spend May 9 and a portion of May 10 in Durham before visiting the Manchester and Concord campuses on the afternoon of the 10th.

“Elizabeth is a proven and versatile leader devoted to the mission and values of public land grant universities” said USNH Board Chair Alex Walker. “She brings the experience track record and capabilities to lead a multi-campus institution that is part of a larger well-coordinated public higher education system. She distinguished herself among a very strong pool of candidates as the right person to lead the University of New Hampshire in these dynamic and challenging times in higher education.”

From 2017 to 2020 Chilton was dean of the Harpur College of Arts and Sciences at Binghamton University part of the State University of New York system. Prior to that she spent 16 years at the University of Massachusetts Amherst serving in a variety of roles including professor anthropology department chair and associate vice chancellor for research and engagement.

She earned her bachelor’s degree in anthropology from the University at Albany SUNY and then her master’s and Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Her academic work focuses on the pre-colonial archaeology of Northeast North America as well as paleoecology cultural resource management heritage studies and materials science. She is the author of dozens of peer-reviewed book chapters and journal articles.

Chilton is an avid hiker kayaker and canoeist as well as an enthusiastic choral singer. Her husband Michael Sugerman is also an anthropology professor. The couple has an adult son and three lively dogs."

That’s a monumental question facing tech companies today as they struggle to define their approach to work in a post-pandemic world.

Sure there have been fully remote companies like GitLab for some time now but the conventional wisdom prior to the pandemic was that you mostly needed to be in the same place to get serious work done.

This was certainly true for larger tech companies. Salesforce Microsoft Google Meta Amazon and Apple didn’t build sprawling campuses or skyscrapers across the world just to abandon them for no reason. They built them to house their workers and show off their sheer economic power. But when the pandemic hit in March 2020 it changed how we think of work possibly forever.

Suddenly we had a giant laboratory to experiment with everyone working from home and while there are certainly some problems depending on your business your job and frankly your living situation it showed that whole categories of workers didn’t need to be sitting in a cubby farm inside a big building to get their jobs done — certainly not five days a week.

I spoke to a variety of people in the tech world from consultants and investors to startup founders to try and get a grip on exactly what the next phase of work is going to look like and without a doubt tech companies have at least become a lot more flexible when it comes to face time at the office.

Company policies are evolving

There is no one-size-fits-all answer here but there are enough examples to suggest some shift away from the traditional office setup even for well-established companies.

When Twitter shut down its offices in 2020 it looked like it was going to close them forever — until it changed course earlier this year and went hybrid. Apple much to its staff’s chagrin went hybrid as well albeit with a certain number of days in the office required. In contrast Salesforce lets workers choose how much they come into the office if at all.

It’s worth noting that Apple’s workers are not happy about being forced to return to the office even for a few days a week. Fortune reported last month that three-quarters of employees were displeased with the mandate and were even considering quitting over it.

TechCrunch recently reported that Airbnb announced a companywide policy of “work from anywhere” while PayPal closed an office that housed its Xoom unit in San Francisco.

Matt Hoffman a former HR exec at DigitalOcean who is currently a partner at M13 said he works with a lot of early-stage tech companies many of which were born just before or during the pandemic.

“They don’t know anything but working remotely and I will tell you I don’t really see — I mean every company is different — but the vast majority have no interest in ever going to the office because they’re not anchored by the fact that they’re paying for this real estate that they need to make use of” he said.

Larger companies often are however meaning that the bigger the company the more inclined it may be to repopulate expensive buildings.

Scott Johnston CEO at Docker a company that reinvented itself over the last couple of years said the reorganization began at the end of 2019 and he made the decision to shutter offices for good after the pandemic forced closures in March 2020.

“So in our first year [after the restructuring] we were facing COVID. And we sent everyone home to work from home. But then we also realized as a Series A-level startup we don’t need these underutilized offices and we actually sold them. We are now a 100% digital-first organization and we don’t have offices” Johnston told me. What’s more he sees no reason to have that overhead ever again.

Johnston is in line with other startup founders like Iman Abuzeid co-founder and CEO at Incredible Health a startup that helps connect employers mostly hospitals to nurses looking for work.

“We decided to go fully remote in January of 2021 and as of January of 2022 we no longer have a San Francisco office. We don’t have any offices. Our headquarters are in the cloud” Abuzeid told me.

She said that her thinking evolved as the pandemic progressed and after talking to employees it was clear that people liked the flexibility. She decided to go with it.

But as Hoffman said every company is different. Front co-founder and CEO Mathilde Collin said that her shared inbox startup really missed working together.

“For my workplace I know one thing for sure: The extreme of a fully remote company will not work for us in the long run. Having been forced to work from home in almost total physical isolation from my co-workers for 18 months it’s become clear to me that the short-term gains — saving money on office space for instance — aren’t worth the downsides that come with it” she said.

“That’s why my company will switch to a [home-office] hybrid model of work. This is in no way unique: Once you reject both the fully remote model and going back to how things were pre-pandemic the hybrid model is the only option on the table.”

Choice over mandates

Even the most ardent WFH advocates understand the value of getting colleagues together — it helps build company culture. What’s more connections that exist online are enhanced by being together and having group dinners and activities even on an occasional basis.

Karen Mangia vice president of customer and market insight at Salesforce has written several books on remote work including 2020’s “Working from Home” and last year’s “Success from Anywhere.” She said she just completed over 300 interviews about working from home and while people definitely want to gather with colleagues from time to time the message she heard was to make it count when you do.

“The question that’s top of mind for people is what is the activity that we are going to be doing or the experience that we’re going to be having that is fundamentally different when we are together versus not” she said.

What’s more she said people don’t want to be dictated to anymore.

“We see some organizations saying well people are coming back to the office five days a week or three days a week and here’s our mandate. What many employees question in that context that comes to the surface is: ‘Well why? What’s the purpose of that?’ Because if you look at the results for most organizations [during the pandemic-induced office shutdown] it showed that they were still able to grow with people in that work-at-home environment” she said.

She said the conventional thinking goes something like this: Employers want their people in the office and the workers would rather not come in unless it’s absolutely necessary but she said it doesn’t have to be that black and white.

“A lot of the research I’ve done seems to paint that it’s kind of this employer-versus-employee kind of battle. It makes it seem binary right? Like the employer wants people in the office and the employee does not want people to be there and that there’s this tug of war” she said.

“And as I started doing a bunch of research about how do we close this gap between what employers are willing to offer and what employees expect right now this theme about the power of choice showed up very consistently as a positive and effective technique” she said.

As Apple found when you force the issue you can alienate your workforce. In a highly competitive job market that’s probably not what you want to do.

Part of the problem and perhaps what Apple and other large organizations are facing is that in spite of two years of doing this managers still aren’t completely sure how to manage employees when they aren’t in front of them.

Dion Hinchcliffe an analyst at Constellation Research who has been studying remote work and digital trends for years said his latest research showed that for knowledge workers productivity is way up with WFH and companies really need to figure out whether it’s even prudent to call workers back to the office.

“The big debate that seems to be going on is do we make everyone come back to the office once a week or twice a month or even once a month? What does that look like? What’s the policy going to be because they want to have set times to build team cohesion. The big concern is about losing their corporate culture” he said.

In addition to productivity gains from WFH companies have access to a deeper pool of talent because workers don’t have to live within a certain radius of a physical office. Hinchliffe said that the biggest challenge for managers beyond building esprit de corps is simply figuring out how to manage remote employees.

It seems clear that two years beyond the March 2020 shutdown smaller companies see little need for an office while larger ones especially those with expensive office and real estate holdings may feel differently. But now that employees have seen the benefits of working remotely it’s going to be hard to put the genie back in the bottle and providing a level of flexibility is going to be a differentiating factor for employers moving forward.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhLW1hZy5jb20vbmV3cy9zb21lLXZlcnktcHJvZml0YWJsZS1jb21wYW5pZXMtcGFpZC1uby10YXhlcy0tdGlwYWx0aS1zYWlkLTY3NzUyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Some Very Profitable U.S. Companies Paid No Taxes Study Said,"May 7 2022

Charter Communications Nike and Salesforce.com are the top three companies that paid no taxes despite billions in income in 2020 according to research conducted by Tipalti a global business consulting company with offices in California and Texas.

Each of the top 10 companies ranked by income that paid no taxes actually had negative tax rates because of millions they received in tax rebates Tipalti said.

The following chart shows the corporations with biggest pre-tax income that paid $0 in taxes the amount the companies got back in rebates and other payments and the effective tax rate according to Tipalti.

In other research Tipalti found that the most common tax violation corporations were charged with was failure to pay taxes. For the tax year 2020 286725 penalties were issued for a total in funds to be repaid of $589 million. Only 59 fraud penalties were issued against corporations and only $7.9 million in fines were assessed

Failure to pay taxes that are owed also is the most common offense for individuals and trusts with more than 19 million penalties issues and $7.1 billion in back taxes and fines collected.

“The volume of unpaid taxes is equivalent to about three-quarters of the entire annual federal budget deficit and this is how much the U.S. misses out each and every year through unpaid taxes” Tipalti said in its report “Tax Offenses: The World’s Biggest Tax Offenders.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdGhld2Vlay5jb20vZmVhdHVyZS8xMDEzMjg3L3doZXJlLW1ham9yLWNvbXBhbmllcy1zdGFuZC1vbi1hYm9ydGlvbi1yaWdodHMtdGhlLXNjb3R1cy1sZWFr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where major companies stand on reproductive health care policies,"It's becoming increasingly difficult for companies to remain silent on controversial social issues — take the bitter LGBTQ-related standoff between The Walt Disney Company and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) as a recent example.

The latest blurring of the lines between business and politics however was sparked by the leaked draft majority opinion suggesting the Supreme Court is poised to overturn federal abortion rights as protected under 1973's Roe v. Wade. Here's where tech giants and leading businesses stand so far:

Airbnb: 'We will work to make sure our employees have the resources they need'

In a request for comment regarding the leaked opinion and its resulting expected effect on employee healthcare vacation rental company Airbnb told The San Francisco Standard that the company's ""healthcare coverage supports reproductive rights and we will work to make sure our employees have the resources they need to make choices about their reproductive rights as we committed to last fall"" in the wake of Texas' extreme six-week abortion ban.

Amazon: Up to $4000 a year in travel expenses

Amazon the nation's second-largest private employer has offered to cover up to $4000 a year in travel expenses for employees seeking non-threatening medical care including abortions if said care is unavailable within 100 miles of their residence and virtual care is not possible.

Apple: 'Actively monitoring the legal proceedings'

Tech giant Apple which has a large presence in Texas has said its health insurance covers both abortions and related travel fees. It appears Apple's policy has been in place since at least September 2021 when it confirmed to TechCrunch that it was keeping an eye on the legal challenges surrounding the Texas ban.

""We are actively monitoring the legal proceedings challenging the uniquely restrictive abortion law in Texas"" Apple wrote in an employee memo. ""In the meantime we want to remind you that our benefits at Apple are comprehensive and that they allow our employees to travel out-of-state for medical care if it is unavailable in their home state.""

Bumble and Match Group: 'We believe strongly in women's right to choose'

Online dating app Bumble commented on Monday's draft leak the following evening. ""The headlines today regarding the leaked draft opinion to overturn abortion rights in the United States are profoundly unsettling"" the company wrote on Twitter. ""At Bumble we believe strongly in women's right to choose and exercise complete control over their bodies.""

In September both Bumble and fellow dating app service Match Group separately announced they would each be launching relief funds for Texas employees in need of out-of-state abortion care. ""As I have said before the company generally does not take political stands unless it is relevant to our business"" Match Group CEO Shar Dubey said in a memo at the time. ""But in this instance I personally as a woman in Texas could not keep silent.""

Citigroup: A target of House Republicans

In March Citigroup became the first major bank to announce it would pay travel costs for employees affected by the abortion ban in Texas where it employs over 8000 workers. ""In response to changes in reproductive health care laws in certain states in the U.S. beginning in 2022 we provide travel benefits to facilitate access to adequate resources"" the bank said in a filing.

Citigroup subsequently came under fire for its decision; House Republicans urged the U.S. to cancel government contracts with the bank and a Texas lawmaker threatened to introduce a bill preventing Citigroup from underwriting municipal bonds.

CVS Health: 'We've made out-of-state care accessible and affordable'

In response to a request for comment on the draft opinion from Fortune CVS offered the following: ""We're monitoring the situation closely and evaluating how we can best support the coverage needs of our colleagues clients and consumers. We've made out-of-state care accessible and affordable for employees in states that have instituted more restrictive laws.""

Levi Strauss: 'Business leaders need to make their voices heard'

""Given what is at stake business leaders need to make their voices heard and act to protect the health and well-being of our employees"" Levi Strauss wrote in a statement released Wednesday. ""That means protecting reproductive rights."" The clothing brand is also reimbursing employees for travel expenses incurred while seeking health-care services unavailable in their state including abortions. Part-time hourly workers are able to seek reimbursement as well.

Salesforce: Helping employee families relocate out of Texas

Software company Salesforce offered in September to help employees and their families relocate out of Texas following the passage of its abortion law.

Salesforce did not take an explicit stance on the Texas law in its statement CNN noted at the time.

Uber and Lyft: Creating legal defense funds

Both Uber and Lyft each announced in September they'd be creating legal defense funds to help drivers sued under the Texas law which financially incentivizes and deputizes private citizens to sue anyone who aids or abets an abortion (including ride-sharing drives) after six weeks of pregnancy. Both companies recently extended the same coverage to drivers in Oklahoma.

Lyft also previously pledged to donate $1 million to Planned Parenthood. ""We've made our perspective on this quite clear"" Lyft co-founder and President John Zimmer told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday after the leak. ""So we will continue to look for ways to make a difference to speak out and to most importantly take action.""

UTA: 'The right to choose … has been a bedrock'

Hollywood's United Talent Agency also responded to the draft ruling by notifying its employees it would reimburse travel expenses related to reproductive health services unable to be accessed within their state. ""We're doing this to support the right to choose that has been a bedrock of settled law for almost half a century"" CEO Jeremy Zimmer said in a memo to employees. ""Several states have already introduced restrictive legislation and the draft Supreme Court ruling leaked yesterday if it comes to pass could make abortion illegal in more than half of the country.""

Yelp: 'Turning back the clock … will have a seismic impact'

Online review website Yelp has been outspoken in its opposition to an overruling of Roe warning such a decision from the court would have a ""seismic impact on our society and economy.""

""Turning back the clock on the progress women have made over the past 50 years will have a seismic impact on our society and economy"" Yelp continued in its statement on the matter. ""This goes against the will of the vast majority of Americans who agree that decisions around reproductive care should be made by women and their doctors."" The company also called on Congress to codify Roe into law.

Prior to the Monday evening leak Yelp had announced it would be covering expenses for employees and their spouses who must travel out of state for abortion care. The policy arrived in response to a restrictive six-week ban out of Texas but the benefit extends to employees in other states as well. Mirian Warren the company's chief diversity officer has said Yelp is not concerned about backlash.

Per a Wednesday report from The New York Times businesses who appear yet to directly comment on the draft ruling include PricewaterhouseCoopers Oracle JP Morgan Chase Walmart Disney ThirdLove Patagonia Kroger and Meta (though Sheryl Sandberg did post on Facebook writing that ""this is a scary day for women all across our country"").

The 22-year-old college student claimed had been preparing for the risky climb for a month and had used Google Maps to find his way to the structure

Abortion is a topic that has been debated for years and years. With pro-life and pro-choice people attacking each other with facts one person took it to the next level. A 22-year-old man who dubs himself the ""Pro-life Spiderman"" climbed the New York Times building in New York and the Salesforce Tower in San Francisco and posted anti-abortion placards. Maison DesChamps calls himself a ""rock climber that has recently started climbing skyscrapers to end abortion.""



Only days after the leaked draught opinion that Roe v. Wade could be overturned by the Supreme Court DesChamps ascended California's second-tallest skyscraper to deliver a pro-life message and raise money for anti-abortion causes. On Tuesday May 3 2022 morning DesChamps traveled from Las Vegas to San Francisco and began climbing the 1070-foot-tall Salesforce Tower at 9 am. The 22-year-old college student had been preparing for the risky climb for a month and had used Google Maps to find his way to the structure.

DesChamps was arrested for ascending the building. “Officers placed DesChamps in custody once he climbed all 61 floors to reach the tower's roof"" the Daily Mail reported. ""He appeared to only be wearing a hoodie as several office workers inside the tower recorded footage of the climber reaching their floors without any climbing gear."" He was detained by the San Francisco Police Department and charged with two misdemeanors -- trespassing and resisting a police investigation for failing to comply with police commands to stop climbing. On Tuesday afternoon May 3 2022 he was released.



A KGO-TV reporter asked DesChamps whether he was scared to which he responded ""No...I cut my feet which means bringing your feet off the wall and I hung one off one hand to show off a little bit ya know?"" DesChamps was asked if he had any regrets and he simply replied ""No... it was fun. I'd do it again. I don't have any regrets. We're sending a message.""

DesChamps spoke regarding doctors who abort saying ""These doctors are literally killing these babies on the table and leaving them out to die. We're not trying to yell at women who want to have an abortion we don't want to blame them... we just want to let them know there are other options.""



DesChamps also climbed the New York Times building. On Thursday May 5 2022 morning he scaled the 52-story 721-foot New York Times skyscraper in New York City. DesChamps scaled the Gray Lady's house at 5 am and hung two signs. ""Abortion kills more than 9/11 every week!"" read one of the signs. The pro-life protester was able to get access to the New York Times building and fled through the stairway. DesChamps posted videos on Instagram of himself climbing the New York Times building. The man has taken things really to the next level. What are your thoughts on the dangerous stunts?",,,

These two businesses came together through the $19 billion acquisition of SanDisk in 2016 which led the company to diversify its nearly five-decade business away from HDD and it became one of the largest Flash players in the industry.

Activist Commentary: Elliott is a very successful and astute activist investor particularly in the technology sector. Their team includes analysts from leading tech private equity firms engineers operating partners – former technology CEO and COOs. When evaluating an investment they also hire specialty and general management consultants expert cost analysts and industry specialists. They often watch companies for many years before investing and have an extensive stable of impressive board candidates.

On May 3 2022  Elliott sent a letter to Western Digital's board expressing its belief that the company should separate its NAND flash memory business. Elliott called on the board to conduct a full strategic review and expressed its belief that such a separation could lead to a stock price of $100+ per share by the end of 2023.

As new ""activists"" come on to the scene we have seen a fair amount of ""sell the company"" activism with no detailed plan or reason why. We have been very critical of this style of activism as short term and greedy. Those activists who did not understand why we were being so critical should read Elliott's letter as an example of well thought out deeply analyzed shareholder-focused strategic activism campaign. Elliott provides a detailed 13-page letter of why the company's two businesses need to be separated and a plan to achieve the separation that is in the best interest of shareholders.

The company is one of the largest providers of storage components for data infrastructure globally and has built a successful HDD business. However the HDD industry began a slow decline in 2013 as desktop and notebook PCs transitioned toward faster NAND flash solid-state drives (SSDs). So in 2015 the company announced it would acquire SanDisk for $19 billion to enter the higher-growth Flash industry. In the years following this acquisition the HDD industry rebounded and has now become a growth market again with Western Digital as one of the two dominant providers of this technology behind Seagate. Western Digital is the only company today that operates in both HDD and NAND flash.

In the last six years the company has underperformed in several areas. First they have attempted to deliver on the strategic synergies of a combined HDD and Flash portfolio but have lost market share in both HDD and Flash. Second the operational missteps have consistently led to unfulfilled financial targets including in revenue compound annual growth rate gross margins operating expenses and operating margin. Third the company has poor stock price performance returning -23.10% 6.14% and -39.57% over the past 1- 3- and 5-year periods versus -0.89% 41.07% and 74.0% for the S&P 500 respectively.

In its letter Elliott makes a convincing argument that the reason why Western Digital is underperforming is because the two businesses should not be in the same company. Both businesses are solid and have good market share but would have significantly more value as standalones. HDD and Flash are totally different technologies: spinning mechanical disks versus leading-edge semiconductor devices. The manufacturing processes are separate and while the businesses share common customers the products can be in competition in certain use cases.

Prior to the SanDisk acquisition Western Digital consistently had a higher price-earnings ratio than its closest peer Seagate. Since the acquisition Seagate has had a significantly higher price-earnings ratio. Today Western Digital has an enterprise value of $21 billion compared to the combined $34 billion pro forma enterprise value of Western Digital and SanDisk when they announced the acquisition six years ago representing $13 billion of value loss. By contrast in the same period Seagate grew its enterprise value from $17 billion to $22 billion. When Western Digital announced its acquisition of SanDisk its stock was trading at $75 per share. Six years later the stock has declined by nearly 30% to $53 per share. In the same time period the S&P 500 and Nasdaq increased by 103% and 190% respectively. Seagate (the company's closest HDD peer) has outperformed Western Digital by 278% over the last decade and Micron (its closest NAND peer) has outperformed Western Digital by 868% over the last decade.

Elliott believes that Western Digital's valuation today reflects the market's view that owning HDD and Flash together yields a clash of synergies in terms of operational and financial performance. Accordingly they are calling on the company to explore a full separation of the Flash business which they believe could lead to a stock price of $100+ per share by the end of 2023 and they illustrate the path to get there.

Western Digital's HDD business has 38% market share (versus 46% for Seagate) $9.4 billion of revenue (versus $12 billion for Seagate) 21% growth rate (versus 18% for Seagate) and both companies have a 30% gross profit margin. Using Seagate's multiples of 1.8x LTM revenue and 6.1x LTM gross profit Western Digital's HDD business would have a value of $17 billion.

Western Digital's Flash business generates $10 billion in revenue and similar businesses have been acquired at multiples of 1.7-1.9x revenue. This would attribute a minimum of a $17 billion value to the Flash business. But this is not the normal call for strategic action. Elliott is putting their money where their mouth is and offering $1+ billion of incremental equity capital into the Flash business at an enterprise value of $17 billion to $20 billion which can be utilized either in a spin-off transaction or as equity financing in a sale or merger with a strategic partner. Essentially Elliott is expressing their willingness to participate in the acquisition of the Flash business with a $1 billion investment. So Elliott sees each business valued at approximately $17 billion while the entire enterprise value of the company is $21 billion.

If Elliott does get the Flash business divested at the value they are putting their own money behind that would attribute a $4 billion valuation for the entire HDD business. There is good reason to believe that there are buyers out there for the Flash business especially with a combination of Western Digital's Flash business with its joint venture partner Kioxia. Western Digital's interest in acquiring Kioxia is well documented over the years including a proposal in 2017 and the rumored $20 billion transaction value last year (1.7x LTM revenue). In the past five years Kioxia has been publicly rumored to receive interest from a long list of other strategic and financial parties.

Their plan could resonate favorably with the company's current board and management team. The decision to acquire SanDisk predates the company's CEO David Goeckeler and his leadership team nearly all of whom were hired in 2020 or later. In fact Goeckeler's first operational move was separating HDD and Flash within Western Digital. It is not a big step to get the board to separate it into a different company particularly since only two of Western Digital's current ten directors were on the board for the SanDisk acquisition. Moreover shareholder activism is about the power of persuasion and the power of the argument and Elliott makes a very compelling argument here.

It should also be noted that Elliott reported an approximate $1 billion investment in the company but has not filed a 13D despite having a roughly 6% position. Based on their history and philosophy that is likely because Elliott is using swaps and other derivatives to build their position and those types of securities are not required to be included in ""beneficial ownership"" for the purposes of 13D filings at this time. The use of swaps in this manner is the subject of a current Securities and Exchange Commission proposal and could very well change in the short term forcing Elliott to file a 13D in this investment.

U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff rejected a request from the artist Mason Rothschild to dismiss the suit. Hermes sued Rothschild in January over the MetaBirkins NFTs which show the bags covered in “colorful fur.”

The lawsuit according to Reuters said Rothschild began offering the NFTs at the Art Basel art fair last December in Miami without the permission of Hermes. This reportedly netted Rothschild over $1 million by early January.

Hermes has referred to Rothschild as a “digital speculator” and called MetaBirkins a “get rich quick” scheme saying he can’t just use a trademark because he’s calling himself an artist.

According to Rothschild the works were commenting on the “cruelty inherent in Hermes’ manufacture of its ultra-expensive leather handbags.” He said they were protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and added that his art doesn’t lose First Amendment protection just because he sells it.

The lawsuit is reportedly being watched because it could clarify how trademark law will work when NFTs are in the picture.

PYMNTS wrote that publicized reports that NFTs are fading out might not be accurate as they’re actually doing quite well by other metrics.

While an earlier report predicted “the beginning of the end” for the NFTs a report from Chainalysis said that while transaction volume fluctuates the number of buyers and sellers had always been growing.

The report also said there were more weekly active collections referring to one with any transaction in that time on NFT market OpenSea.

This is important because of the potential uses for NFTs which can be a medium for “anything from songs to stocks.” For instance Goldman Sachs has been looking into ways to use NFTs to hold and trade financial instruments.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsaWNrb25kZXRyb2l0LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLzIwMjIvMDUvMDcvcmloYW5uYS1pcy1vcGVuaW5nLWEtc2F2YWdlLXgtZmVudHktc3RvcmVmcm9udC1pbi1kZXRyb2l0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rihanna is opening a Savage X Fenty storefront in Detroit,"DETROIT – Rihanna’s lingerie brand Savage X Fenty will be making its debut in Detroit with a brick-and-mortar storefront.

With gas prices approaching $4 a gallon in some regions as we head into the weekend individuals on a fixed income may be struggling to make ends meet. You might even wonder if you can use your EBT card from the program formerly known as food stamps at a gas station.

Look: SNAP 2022: Is My State Giving Out Extra Money in April?

More: Have Any $200 Quarters Lying Around? It’s Worth Checking Your Spare Change

The answer to that is “Maybe.” Depending on the government benefits you receive you may even be able to use EBT-Cash — but not EBT from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) — for fuel and other gas station purchases.

Understanding TANF vs. SNAP

First let’s go over a quick review of the programs available to help low-income households across the U.S. including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program formerly known as food stamps is administrated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and provides benefits to families on an electronic debit card that can be used to buy food non-alcoholic beverages ingredients for meals and seeds at grocery stores and other retailers that accept EBT as a form of payment.

The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program also offers an EBT card (called EBT Cash) and it can be used for a wider range of living expenses including fuel housing home maintenance supplies personal hygiene and other living expenses. You can also withdraw cash from an ATM using your ETC Cash card.

Can You Use Your EBT Card at Gas Stations?

Many gas stations across the U.S. accept EBT/food stamps and EBT-Cash cards. According to FoodStampsnow.com more than 50 gas stations across the country accept EBT including large chains like 7-Eleven Circle K Cumberland Farms Flying J and Exxon Mobil.

If you are using an EBT Cash card at a location that accepts EBT you can use it to fuel up your vehicle and purchase virtually anything in the store including personal hygiene products or food. You will not be able to purchase cigarettes alcohol vaping products lottery tickets and scratch-offs or anything that cannot be legally purchased by children under the age of 18.

However if your EBT card is only good for SNAP benefits you’ll be even more limited to the things you can buy. In addition to the above “adult-only” items you cannot purchase fuel prepared convenience foods such as pre-cooked hot dogs from a 7-Eleven gas station or foods to go like an ice cream cone from Cumberland Farms. However you can purchase milk bread butter or any of the other groceries commonly sold at gas stations or convenience stores.

Story continues

Foodstampsnow.com advises readers to call ahead to ensure the gas station near you accepts EBT since rules may vary based on the franchise owner. You can also look for the sign in the door or window saying that EBT is accepted at that location.

The actor 23 who plays Cedric 'Charley' Charlton in the ITV remake of The Darling Buds Of May will appear in the second series despite on-set tensions that led to his co-star Sabrina 30 quitting the show - with Joelle Ray 21 replacing her.

The Sun claims that Tok used the image after Sabrina took a selfie on his phone with the Mariette actress said to have complained to show bosses saying it made her 'uncomfortable.'

Claims: Ex The Larkins star Sabrina Bartlett complained about co-star Tok Stephen using a snap of her as his WhatsApp profile picture - a new report has claimed

A show insider told the publication: 'He insisted he had only done it as a joke but she made a complaint about his behaviour.

'From that point on there was a real tension between the two of them.'

A representative for ITV declined to comment to MailOnline.

Mailonline has also contacted representatives for Tok and Sabrina for comment.

Last week The Mail On Sunday revealed that the reason Sabrina decided not to return to The Larkins is because she made a complaint about Tok's behaviour to ITV bosses.

Back: The actor 23 who plays Cedric 'Charley' Charlton in the ITV remake of The Darling Buds Of May will appear in the second series despite on-set tensions that led to his co-star Sabrina 30 quitting the show

The Mail on Sunday has been told the broadcaster launched an investigation into the allegation but yesterday ITV refused to confirm or deny that one took place.

Tok's return comes after Sabrina walked out of the programme.

One member of The Larkins team said: 'Tok is back but we are sad and surprised that Sabrina is not.

'We all assumed Tok wouldn't be back when Sabrina quit. The last we heard was that there would be a new duo playing Mariette and Charley.

'Sabrina loved the show. It is a great shame she has decided to leave.'

It understood that Tok has not yet been on set and it is unclear when he will be because the majority of his scenes would need to be filmed with Ms Bartlett's replacement.

Report: The Sun claims that Tok used the image after Sabrina took a selfie on his phone with the Mariette actress said to have complained to show bosses saying it made her 'uncomfortable' (Sabrina pictured on the show)

ITV sources confirmed they had yet to find the right actress to play Mariette but hope to be able to announce their new star soon.

Catherine Zeta-Jones took the role in the original TV adaptation a part that shot her to Hollywood stardom.

Last month scenes starring Peter Davison who plays the show's foul-mouthed vicar were recorded in a sleepy Kent village.

In February it was revealed that Sabrina would not be returning to The Larkins with her publicist saying it was due to scheduling clashes. She is yet to announce her next work.

The actress who starred in the first series of Netflix's Bridgerton also left her agents the London-based Independent Talent Group which represents Mr Stephen too. It declined to comment yesterday.

Tok who graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 2017 has also appeared in the ITV drama Grantchester and the BBC series Holby City and Silent Witness.

New role? Joelle Rae 21 is set to replace Sabrina in the show

His character Charley in The Larkins was played by Philip Franks in the original TV adaptation of H.E. Bates's novel. Bradley Walsh 61 and Joanna Scanlan 60 play Pop and Ma Larkin in the new series.

In an interview last year Tok spoke fondly of his fellow cast members saying: 'Bradley Walsh is hilarious and Sabrina Bartlett is lovely to work with and I've always really admired Joanna Scanlan. I think it's any actor's dream to shoot in a location where you don't have to imagine your surroundings. We were able to live it.'

A spokesman for Sabrina did not respond to a request to comment at the time.

ITV said it 'takes its duty-of-care responsibilities to all individuals on all productions extremely seriously'.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uemhlcmFsZC5jby5uei9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2VkLXNoZWVyYW4tY2VsZWJyYXRlcy13aWZlcy1iaXJ0aGRheS13aXRoLWluc3RhZ3JhbS1tZXNzYWdlLXBob3RvL1FaNkk2WE9QQkxUQk02SFRMTktBTDZHS0g0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ed Sheeran celebrates wife's birthday with Instagram message photo,"The singer celebrates his wife's birthday with a rare personal snap on Instagram.

Ed Sheeran celebrated his wife's 30th birthday with a sweet message on Instagram.

The 31-year-old singer/songwriter posted a rare personal picture of himself and Cherry Seaborn as he celebrated his wife's milestone birthday and captioned it: ""HBD to ma baby mama. 30 looks good on you.""

Sheeran and Seaborn tied the knot in 2019 and welcomed daughter Lyra Antarctica in 2020.

It was recently revealed Sheeran and Seaborn have built an observatory for astronomy in their garden.

The pair have invested in ""all the gear"" for the stargazing hobby and have a viewing dome in the garden of their Suffolk home.

A source told The Sun newspaper's Bizarre column: ""Ed doesn't have many nights off — and will have even fewer when he goes on tour. But when he does he loves to be able to look at the night sky.

""He has all the gear to observe the constellations and knows a thing or two about it all which might surprise a lot of people.

""There is a powerful telescope for him to use for his stargazing and because he lives out in the countryside it is really dark and the visibility is great.

""It has been a fun thing to learn about. Looking up at the night sky can really put things into perspective.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN1bi5jby51ay90dmFuZHNob3diaXovMTg0OTA5MDUvZWQtc2hlZXJhbi1yYXJlbHktc2Vlbi13aWZlLWNoZXJyeS1iaXJ0aGRheS_SAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVzdW4uY28udWsvdHZhbmRzaG93Yml6LzE4NDkwOTA1L2VkLXNoZWVyYW4tcmFyZWx5LXNlZW4td2lmZS1jaGVycnktYmlydGhkYXkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ed Sheeran shares snap of rarely seen wife Cherry to celebrate her 30th birthday as she drinks beer on a...,"MY CHERRY AMOR Ed Sheeran shares snap of rarely seen wife Cherry to celebrate her 30th birthday as she drinks beer on a hammock

The relaxed picture gave a rare insight into the couple's relationship which they prefer to keep private.

Ed 31 captioned the sweet image: ""HBD to ma baby mama. 30 looks good on you 🍒""

The pair were childhood sweethearts and grew up together.

They got back together in 2014 and wed in 2018.

In February 2018 The Sun exclusively revealed that the pair had got married in secret with NO celebrities as guests.

Ed hosted the ceremony at his country estate in Suffolk just before Christmas 2017 despite having his plans to build a wedding chapel on site rejected.

Ed and Cherry have one daughter together Lyra Antarctica who is twenty months old.

In July 2020 it was revealed that Cherry had left her high-powered London job as a risk manager with Deloitte to grow fruit and veg.

Cherry’s LinkedIn page said she is “working to create a self-sufficient ­living environment aiming to produce sustainable energy as well as all fruit and vegetables”.

Last year Ed revealed he wants more kids with Cherry.

In an exclusive interview with The Sun back in October 2021 he said:

He said: “I’d love more kids man I’d love it but it does all depend on what Cherry wants too because it’s her body.

“I’m really proud of Cherry as a mother. She’s such an incredible human I’m just in awe.

“She did a whole Cambridge degree which she started two weeks before giving birth new baby and I went to her graduation three days ago at Jesus College and people were saying like ‘How did she do this with a baby?’”

He added how becoming a dad had kickstarted a massive lifestyle overhaul.

Ed said: “Since becoming a dad I’ve become quite clean-living. But I think actually taking time off and not being on tour was the worst thing for my health because I would drink every single day.

“I stopped three months before Lyra was born because I was determined I was going to be the person to drive my wife to the ­hospital. I was 15-and-a-half stone at my peak and I think I’m ten-and-a-half now – I was big it really showed. I had a 36 waist — now I’m down to 28.""

He continued: ""It was when Cherry was pregnant the penny dropped. Lyra has been the biggest motivation in terms of detoxing my life and I think it’s a change everyone needs to go through if they’re a parent.”

Daniel Bedingfield has sent fans into meltdown with his hunky new transformation.

The singer now 42 logged into his Instagram account on Friday (May 6) to show off his rugged image completely with a bushy beard.

In the black and white photograph he posed in an unbuttoned shirt and accessories his look with a silver necklace while smouldering for the camera.

He penned alongside his first post in six months: ""Loving the strength returning to my heart finally after all that Trump covid stuck in America b******t. I’m free!""

Unsurprisingly a majority of his 15.900 followers of the Gotta Get Thru This hitmaker rushed to leave a comment for the star underneath the picture.

One fan penned: ""Daniel! You look great.""

Another added: ""Wow! Look at you. Stunning.""

A third person gushed: ""Oh my god....you are beautiful x""

While a fourth social media user said: ""Gorgeous as ever.""

Daniel was last seen on TV in 2016 when he appeared on ITV show Lorraine.

He appeared alongside ex-Sugababes singer Heidi Range to promote West End musical War Of The Worlds which they both were appearing in at the time.

Viewers took to Twitter to remark on how ""handsome"" he looked with some remarking on how lovely it was that he is still alive.

One viewer wrote: ""Daniel Bedingfield is hardly recognisable.""

While another posted: ""Ooooh @DanielBedingfld is looking GOOD on @reallorraine this morning.""

A third added: ""@DanielBedingfld wow well yr looking good on it babe.""

He was involved in a horrific car accident in 2004 and has been living in America for the past ten years songwriting for other artists.

In April 2015 a year before he went on Lorraine the singer himself tweeted: ""So apparently I'm not dead according to Google. Fair enough.""

A financial report from one of the owners on Friday clearly pushed the cost of Plant Vogtle near Augusta past that milestone bringing its total cost to $30.34 billion

That amount doesn’t count the $3.68 billion that original contractor Westinghouse paid to the owners after going bankrupt which would bring total spending to more than $34 billion.

Vogtle is the only nuclear plant under construction in the United States and its costs could deter other utilities from building such plants even though they generate electricity without releasing climate-changing carbon emissions.

The latest increase in the budget by the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia wasn’t a surprise after lead owner Georgia Power Co. announced delays and $920 million in overruns on March 3. Georgia Power’s costs only cover the 45.7% of the plant it owns meaning that the cooperatives and municipal utilities that own the majority of the two-reactor project later update their financial projections as well.

MEAG which owns 22.7% of Vogtle and provides power to city-owned utilities raised its total cost forecast including capital spending and borrowing costs to $7.8 billion from the previous level of $7.5 billion.

Oglethorpe Power Corp. which provides power to 38 cooperatives in Georgia owns 30% of Vogtle. In March bumped up its cost projects by $250 million to $8.5 billion.

The city of Dalton which owns 1.6% estimated its cost at $240 million in 2021. It hasn’t released a public update.

The municipal utility in Jacksonville Florida as well as some other municipal utilities and cooperatives in Florida and Alabama are obligated to buy power from the plant.

When approved in 2012 the third and fourth reactors were estimated to cost $14 billion with the first electricity being generated in 2016. Now the third reactor is set to begin operation in March 2023 and the fourth reactor is set to begin operation in December 2023.

Atlanta-based Southern Co. which owns Georgia Power has been charging increasing shares of its cost overruns as shareholder losses saying it’s unlikely that the Georgia Public Service Commission will approve adding amounts to the bills of Georgia Power’s 2.6 million customers. But Oglethorpe MEAG and Dalton don’t have shareholders meaning customers are fully exposed to overruns.

Georgia Power’s customers as well as some Oglethorpe customers are already paying the costs of Vogtle.

To protect themselves the other owners signed an agreement with Georgia Power in 2018 specifying that if costs reach a certain point the other owners can choose to freeze their costs at that level. In exchange for paying more of the costs Georgia Power would own a larger share of the reactors.

Oglethorpe wants to freeze its costs at $8.1 billion selling 2% of the reactor to Georgia Power in exchange for Georgia Power paying $400 million more in costs. MEAG also said Friday it wants to freeze its costs but didn’t say how much it sought to shift to Georgia Power.

Southern has acknowledged it will have to pay at least $440 million more to cover what would have been other owners’ costs and has said another $460 million is in dispute.

Georgia Power is disputing the cost threshold at which it must shoulder more of the burden and saying it shouldn’t have to pay the other owners’ share of extra costs stemming from COVID-19. The owners are in talks aimed at resolving their disagreements.

“Cost sharing is imminent however until the parties reach agreement Oglethorpe will continue to pay its full share of the construction costs as billed by Georgia Power but will do so under contractual protest” Oglethorpe CEO Mike Smith said in March.

All the owners did vote to continue construction on Feb. 25. Also the owners report that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission in March completed a follow-up inspection of wiring problems at the third reactor and signed off that problems it identified in November had been fixed returning the reactor to its less intensive baseline inspection regime.

Even though some of the Port City's most historic buildings have been knocked down through the years many still remain standing and help make the city unique.

Some of the history is obvious — the Bellamy Mansion Museum and Burgwin-Wright House come to mind among many — but other history is slightly more hidden. Well perhaps not hidden just not within eye level.

Coverage from 2021:A ‘visit’ to 1971 on Wilmington's North Front Street: 50 years later what's changed?

Take the time to slowly walk around downtown and you’ll see some of those gems.

From names of the past to preserved signs and intricate designs there's plenty to see. Here are a few of those buildings and markers.

Southern Bell building

The Messenger and Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph building is actually five separate buildings designed by well-known architect Charles McMillen. The addresses when originally built were between 121-129 Princess St and they were constructed between 1899 and 1906. The phone company moved into the building at 121-123 Princess when it was completed in 1906.

According to Tony Wrenn’s book “Wilmington North Carolina: An Architectural and Historical Portrait"" some of the other various tenants that occupied the buildings over the years include E. Weaver Men’s Clothing Trust Barber Shop Carolina Building and Loan Association and Futrelle’s Pharmacy to name a few.

Current tenants include manna restaurant and Bourgie Nights lounge.

French-Shrier building

The French-Shrier building is located at 32 N. Front St in downtown Wilmington. According to the historical plaque it was built for William French and sold to Isaac Shrier in 1914. The building has been used by various businesses over the years including a shoe store from 1936-1975 and as Lenny’s Men’s Clothes from 1977-2006.

It was renovated in 2008 by Monteith Construction and was first certified LEED (Leadership in Design and Environmental Design) certified building in the county.

Henry E. Bonitz building

The Henry E. Bonitz building is located at 213 Princess St. and was built in 1906. The neoclassical detailed facade is part of the beautifully detailed structure. The architect was Henry Bonitz who is well known for many buildings in Wilmington including Thalian Hall and the building was actually home to his office.

Mugge building

The Mugge building at 200 Princess St. has one of the more unique rooftop designs of any building in downtown Wilmington. It was built in 1892-93 after owner Carl Mugge tore down the three story single building that was previously in the location.

As I prepare to celebrate Nurses Week this year it is with both immeasurable admiration and immense sadness as I can’t help but reflect on the legacy of Dr. Paul Farmer and his impact on the field of nursing.

As a nurse in the 1980’s in Boston working in the HIV field I often crossed paths with a young Paul Farmer and after joining Partners In Health in 2010 I was fortunate to work closely with Paul for over a decade. It was in that time that I came to realize how much he cultivated guided and inspired an entire generation of nurse leaders around the world who continue to build on his work to this day.

Since PIH’s inception in 1987 we have grown into a team of over 19000 employees across 11 countries who provide care to over 8 million people. And the largest clinician cadre amongst our staff are nurses and midwives. Throughout his lifetime Paul was a staunch believer in the value of nursing and the extraordinary role that nurses and midwives play in the strategic delivery of health care. His perspective on nursing was largely shaped by humility and exposure to the incredible work nurses were doing at PIH’s care delivery sites.

He witnessed the consistent presence of strong nurse leaders around him demonstrating their expertise while fulfilling our organization’s mission.

As Paul designed and as core to PIH’s commitment medical education and health care delivery are deeply intertwined. As so many of us have witnessed firsthand Paul was an extraordinary educator and knew that the way to build sustainable change was to invest in quality education in the classroom and at the bedside. Paul fulfilled his aspiration to create the University of Global Health Equity (UGHE) in Rwanda which advances global health delivery by training a new generation of global health leaders equipped in not just building but sustaining effective and equitable health systems. Specifically the university is home to the Center for Nursing & Midwifery which began with an executive education leadership program and will expand to include master’s programs in nursing specialties.

PIH and UGHE leaders are committed to ensuring that the university evolves into a transformational platform for nurses globally. I could not be prouder of what that means for us as an organization as we continue to build our nursing programs such as those at Hôpital Universitaire de Mirebalais in Haiti which trains nurse anesthetists neonatal intensive care unit oncology emergency as well as other nurse specialists and was where PIH’s first Nursing Center of Excellence opened.

Paul was a vocal and relentless advocate for nurses to be in leadership positions worldwide and he was instrumental in supporting my upward trajectory within the organization resulting in me becoming the first nurse CEO of PIH in July 2019. His mentorship and partnership provided me entry into the physician-dominated domain of global NGOs. Throughout our 12-year friendship I witnessed how the values he lived by inspired an entire movement toward global health equity. His values were rooted in the foundation of PIH and in each of us as nurse leaders – values of commitment pragmatic solidarity accompaniment humility and integrity. These are values that set the foundation of my training as a nurse as a CEO and as a global citizen and are values that I see in each of our nurse leaders across PIH.

A few days before he passed Paul sent me a text message from Rwanda with a picture of one of PIH’s nurses teaching a group of medical residents how to do an echocardiogram stating: “Nurses have always been my best teachers.” Paul saw the potential in each human being and he saw the potential in me as a nurse leader. He had extraordinary courage to challenge the status quo to call out the vast injustices in health care while using his voice to influence and raise the visibility of nurses and midwives globally. Paul was inspiring but he was also inspired. He was inspired by this work every day and he was inspired by the nursing teams the nurses at each of our sites that he got to work with side-by-side. I know he would want each of us to continue to work together towards the vision he had for PIH and for the future of the nursing field.

I am deeply grateful for the time I shared with Paul and for the memories I keep close to my heart.

It was such a gift to have experienced life with him and to have felt seen by him. As we celebrate the field of nursing I hope that we all take a moment to thank those who have helped support encourage and amplify nurse leaders for the betterment of global health care for all. I hope we also take the time to celebrate the compassion and leadership that nurses demonstrate every day. During this global pandemic nurses have stepped up in unimaginable ways. I feel honored to be a nurse and to work alongside my colleagues all around the world."

One of America’s largest airline carriers is offering FREE WiFi to all passengers on board some of its flights – up until 10 June.

Having begun the trial just a few days ago (4 May) Southwest Airlines – which is the world’s largest low-cost carrier – is currently offering free WiFi on board a number of its Boeing 737 airplanes.

The trial is part of a test for new hardware – which has recently been installed on 40 of the airline’s fleet – to see if it can cope with large numbers of users at one time as well as provide faster internet to all passengers that connect to it.

Which Flights Are Offering Free WiFi?

As just mentioned the trial of free WiFi is currently taking place on board 40 of Southwest’s Boeing 737 planes – with these aircrafts operating flights throughout the western part of the United States.

Will You Be Able To Stream Netflix Using The FREE WiFi?

Passengers that are on board any of Southwest’s flights that are part of the Free WiFi trial will be able to “stream browse and engage on the internet” according to Southwest’s Vice President of Customer Experience and Customer Relations Tony Roach.

So it does look like passengers will be able to stream their latest Netflix or HBO series whilst cruising at 30000 feet in the air.

The airline’s current offering of WiFi – which is available on board Southwest’s WiFi-enabled aircrafts at a cost of $8 – does not allow passengers to stream movies and content from websites such as Netflix HBO Max Zoom and Microsoft Teams.

This is due to the airline’s WiFi blocking access to high-bandwidth websites applications and video conferencing services.

How Long Will The Trial Last For?

The trial is set to last for six weeks with all passengers on board the 40 flights – that has the new WiFi hardware installed – being able to connect to the WiFi at no cost.

The trial began on 4 May and will continue up until 10 June.

Is Free WiFi Available On All Southwest Flights?

At this moment in time no.

However it could well be in the near future – especially if the newly installed hardware on some of Southwest’s airplanes can cope with large numbers of users at one time.

The airline does currently offer WiFi to all passengers on board its flights at a cost of $8 per passenger to use it – with the service being free to connect to for Southwest’s A-List Preferred Members.

Will Southwest Be Offering FREE WiFi On Board All Of Its Flights In The Future?

At this moment in time this is unknown.

However if the trial is a success then it could be that in the future all Southwest passengers will be able to connect to FREE WiFi – which would allow them to stream their favorite movie or TV series whilst flying high in the sky.

Speaking about the airline’s trial of their upgraded WiFi Southwest’s Vice President of Customer Experience and Customer Relations Tony Roach explained the company’s vision:

“Our goal is to evaluate how the new hardware improves performance while delivering a reliable internet experience used by a large volume of Customers.”

Do Any Other Of The Major Airlines In The U.S. Offer Free WiFi?

Right now only one of America’s major airlines – JetBlue – offers free WiFi to all passengers on board any of its flights.

However just a month ago we reported that five airlines in the U.S. had lowered the cost of their onboard WiFi services.

And just last week it was revealed that Hawaiian Airlines will become the first major airline to provide Elon Musk’s Starlink internet service to passengers on board its flights from next year.

British Airways reduced its summer flight schedules by 10% amid staff shortages.

Southwest Airlines JetBlue and Alaska Airlines had already cut flight numbers this year.

Demand is returning to pre-pandemic levels but airlines are dealing with a lack of staff.

British Airways reduced its flight schedules this summer following its decision to cut almost 10000 jobs when it faced travel restrictions during the pandemic.

The Financial Times reported the news on Saturday.

The UK airline is joining several other carriers in slashing the number of flights it is offering passengers this year. It plans to cut 10% of its flight schedules between March and October due to a shortage in staff according to the FT.

JetBlue Airways cut flights for May by between 8% and 10% and plans to make similar reductions for the summer a CNBC report says. JetBlue made 2500 new hires already this year but it is still understaffed per the report.

Similarly Alaska Airlines cut 2% of its flight schedule until the end of June after being forced to cut flights in April as a result of a lack of staff per the CNBC report. While Southwest Airlines cut 65000 spring flights an SEC filing shows and 20000 summer flights Dallas Morning News reported.

The airline industry is now grappling with staff shortages as it previously cut its workforce during the pandemic amid global travel restrictions and reduced demand. Delta Air Lines was forced to drop more than 10 routes last year because of the slowdown in demand.

The number of flights British Airways has cut is the equivalent of 8000 round trips a majority on short-haul routes British Airways chief executive Sean Doyle told the FT.

The airline plans to hire 6000 new staff members to cope with demand which Doyle says is between 65% and 70% of 2019 levels for business travel.

""The US carriers had similar rebuild problems earlier in the process we see problems in Europe and the UK industry getting the system back up and running"" Doyle told the FT.

However not all airlines are coping with the return in demand but cutting flights as they have fewer operational challenges than big carriers.

British Airways told Insider that while the past few weeks have been ""challenging"" the company is focused on its customers supporting its ""biggest recruitment drive"" and increasing its operational resilience.

""We've taken action to reduce our schedule to help provide certainty for our customers and are giving them maximum flexibility to either rebook with us or another airline as close to their original departure time as possible or to receive a full refund"" British Airways said in a statement.







JetBlue Alaska Airlines and Southwest Airlines were not immediately available for comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsdG9vbmFtaXJyb3IuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy8yMDIyLzA1L2p1c3QtbGlrZS1tb20tZGF1Z2h0ZXJzLXNoYXJlLXBhc3Npb24tZm9yLWFkdmVudHVyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Just like Mom: Daughters share passion for adventure,"Every day when Jackie Leandri and her daughters step out the door to go to work they’re stepping into adventure as flight attendants with Southwest Airlines.

It’s not a career choice for everyone but Jessica Rowe and April Leandri said watching their mom go off to work and taking flights with her when they were young reinforced their desire to work 35000 feet above the ground.

“I remember flying (April) and her friend to Minneapolis for her 16th birthday to go shopping at the Mall of America” Leandri said.

Being a flight attendant didn’t stop her from being involved with the girls while growing up because in addition to the travel aspect the job offers a lot of flexibility she said.

“She was never not at a school event” April said. “She was home for the important stuff.”

It was this flexibility and the prospect of adventure that Leandri’s mother Judy Berryman thinks inspired Jessica and April to follow in their mother’s footsteps.

Both of them wanted to be flight attendants from a young age Jackie said.

“(Jessica) told people she wanted to be a flight attendant like her mom” Jackie said.

She even worked at Mike’s Court and volunteered at the Central PA Humane Society just like Jackie.

After Jessica became a flight attendant eight years ago she and her mom have flown multiple times together.

Now that April has joined Southwest too there could be times when all three of them serve on the same flight — that’s happened once so far. More common though is that two of them are on the same flight something they said makes the trip much more fun.

Once Jackie and Jessica were stranded in Costa Rica for three days with three other Baltimore crews because of a bad snowstorm back home.

That first night the crews sat in a hotel bar and organized an all-day trip for the next day. They pooled their money rented a driver with a van and explored the country.

“We had a blast” Jessica said. “It was awesome I was stuck with her because I was pretty new at the time. I’m glad I was with someone I knew.”

Jessica and April have also flown several times together without their mother.

“We had a long overnight stay in Midland Odessa Texas” Jessica said. “Not anywhere too exciting but we made it fun.”

The last trip they took together the sisters’ connection was announced at every stop.

“People find it so interesting and it does make it a lot easier flying with someone you know” Jessica said.

The one flight that all three of them have been able to fly together was actually April’s very first trip.

“It was a lot of fun” April said. “It makes it easier. It was the first trip I had and that made it a lot less nerve-wracking.”

Once on board the flight Jackie made a formal announcement to the passengers explaining who they were with one man not believing them. Some passengers asked them questions while others even took their picture.

“Even my co-workers think it’s amazing” Jackie said. “It’s great now we get along great now that they’re adults.”

“They were horrible teenagers” she laughed.

Since then their schedules haven’t synced. If her daughters are on reserve she can still try to get on a trip with one of them Jackie said.

“To work with two people you know so well and trust and love it’s a unique situation” Jackie said. “It’s a job where you work with really different people all the time. When you get on a plane with people you know and trust you gel better.”

It was Jessica who took the leap to become a flight attendant first after she graduated from Altoona Area High School and spent a few semesters at Penn State University. She had originally intended to go into the medical field as a nurse and join Southwest later.

“I didn’t know if I was ready; I wanted to figure out for sure that’s what I wanted” Jessica said.

But when applications to become a flight attendant opened up as she was working in an assisted living facility Jackie told Jessica to go for it.

Jackie called it a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and Jessica herself couldn’t believe they had opened up when they did. She was hired at 22 after going through phone and in-person interviews.

April followed after becoming a flight attendant about two months ago.

“It’s mainly because it runs in the family” April said. “We always flew with her.”

Both sisters were surprised they were even picked — especially on their first time applying — because Jackie told them to expect to get shut down.

“It’s difficult to get in they only open it for eight hours at a time” Jackie said of the application process. “I told them it was a long shot.”

With a large airline like Southwest as many as 10000 applications could be submitted during that small timeframe Jackie said. From there it’s up to the recruitment team to whittle down the pool of candidates.

“It’s a job where once you get in you realize how flexible it is” Jackie said. “I have a ton of vacation you don’t work that much … I make $63 an hour and get five weeks’ vacation a year. You’re not going to get that anywhere else. People get hooked.”

Unlike her daughters Jackie didn’t always know what career path she wanted to take. Once she graduated high school — also from Altoona — she didn’t think she was ready for college.

“I got kind of scared and didn’t know what to do” Jackie said.

So she joined the Army. Stationed in Hawaii she worked in intelligence intercepting Morse code.

“That was rough” said Berryman — who is not a flight attendant. “I remember the day before she left she sent flowers to the house for me and needless to say I spent the day on the couch crying.”

It was in Hawaii where Jackie met her future husband who was also in the military got married and had Jessica.

Then after spending 11 years on active duty Jackie left the military in 2000. Then living in the Baltimore area she and her husband agreed it would be too much for them to handle after having had April.

“I stayed home for about two months and I realized I wasn’t cut out to be a stay at home mom” Jackie said.

It was when she went to a job fair with a bunch of military wives that she was hired to work a ticket counter for Southwest.

“I became a supervisor after six months and it wasn’t until 2004 I became a flight attendant” Jackie said. “In that time period I was a customer service representative on 9/11.”

As far as hours went she said it was worse than the military initially because the Transportation Security Administration was not in place. Therefore the customer service people were the ones responsible for conducting bag searches.

“You get out of the military and get an airline job and then 9/11 happens” she said. “It was a few months that was total chaos at the airports. We literally went in and never got out.”

Fortunately her military experience prepared her for the stress of that situation and later when she went to flight attendant training.

The training takes place in Dallas and lasts for three to five weeks Jackie said with a whole week dedicated to just aircraft emergencies.

“You’re in Dallas for a month you don’t go anywhere” Jackie said. “We have to know every single aircraft inside and out emergency equipment CPR first aid be prepared for emergencies evacuations planned and unplanned landings fires.”

Jackie said that while the military prepared her for the stress she still got eight hours of sleep a night in a hotel.

“Military people call it Barbie Doll bootcamp” she said.

Once they’re out of training flight attendants are only scheduled three days a week but are still full time. The more junior you are the more time you spend on call or “in reserve” Jackie said and regardless if you’re called in or not you still get paid a minimum of six hours a day.

Now 22 years later Jackie isn’t planning on hanging up her wings anytime soon and neither are her daughters.

“They knew the life that she led and I think they went after it because of her” Berryman said.

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 0.32%) a leader in tools and storage solutions released its first-quarter earnings on May 2 showcasing resilience amid economic fluctuations. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 slightly above the expected $0.55. Despite a 1.5% drop in revenue from the previous year total revenue of $3.87 billion was likewise better than the consensus forecast for $3.83 billion.

Metric Q1 2024 Q1 2024 Analysts Estimate Q1 2023 % Change Adjusted EPS $0.56 $0.55 ($0.41) N/A Revenue $3.87 billion $3.83 billion $3.93 billion (1.5%) Gross margin 28.6% N/A 21.2% 7.4 percentage points

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives. These areas crucial for long-term value creation embody Stanley Black & Decker's strategic pillars for navigating future market dynamics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zdGFubGV5LWJsYWNrLWRlY2tlci1pbmMtbnlzZS0xNjE0NDAyNzEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations Dennis Lange. Mr. Lange you may begin.

Dennis Lange: Thank you Shannon. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us for Stanley Black & Decker's 2024 first quarter webcast. Here today in addition to myself is Don Allan President and CEO; Chris Nelson COO EVP and President of Tools & Outdoor; and Pat Hallinan EVP and CFO. Our earnings release which was issued earlier this morning and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to are available on the IR section of our website. A replay of this morning's webcast will also be available beginning at 11 AM today. This morning Don Chris and Pat will review our 2024 first quarter results and various other matters followed by a Q&A session. Consistent with prior webcast we are going to be sticking with just one question per caller.

And as we normally do we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call based on our current views. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate and as such they involve risk and uncertainty. It's therefore possible that the actual results may materially differ from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. We direct you to the cautionary statements in the 8-K that we filed with our press release and in our most recent 34 Act filing. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO Don Allan.

Don Allan: Thank you Dennis and good morning everyone. Our first quarter performance was the result of consistent solid execution and we are making progress against key operational objectives. We continue to see significant value creation opportunities tied to our strategic business transformation and the entire company is focused on the disciplined execution of this strategy. We are encouraged by the momentum that is building across the organization. Two of our primary areas of emphasis are free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion. We are focused on what is within our control and are pleased with the momentum behind our gross margin. This is particularly notable considering a significantly worse negative macro environment and corresponding revenue performance in 2023 and '24 versus our initial expectations at the outset of our transformation in mid-2022.

Story continues

Our global cost reduction program remains on track for expected run rate savings of $1.5 billion by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025. As we hit the halfway point of our journey our decisive actions are delivering quantifiable results. Specifically we have captured 1.2 billion of run rate savings program to date. We remain confident this will support 30% gross margins in 2024 consistent with our guidance. We are encouraged that approximately 80% of the company's revenue is expected to carry 2024 adjusted gross margins in excess of 30% and exit this year at or ahead of initial expectations. We believe these product lines will continue to improve upon their current adjusted gross margin profile over the next 18 to 24 months.

As it relates to the rest of the portfolio or that 20% which is predominantly our cyclically depressed outdoor business and the rapidly recovering aerospace fastener business. We are actioning significant cost efficiencies to make necessary improvements to the profitability of outdoor in response to the current market demand and refining the aerospace fastener product line cost base to drive significant growth leverage as widebody plane production continues to recover. Our long-term success will be driven by improved profitability coupled with consistent market share gains. We believe our share position in tools is now stable to increasing. For example our 2023 point-of-sale data in tools performed better than the category average across the North American home centers which was led by our iconic DEWALT Professional brand.

We are also serving our customers better by delivering improved fill rates earning the right for more activity across our brands. Retailers are recognizing this performance. For 2023 ACE Hardware named Craftsman as Vendor of the Year and Grainger recognized Stanley Black & Decker with their partners and Performance Award. Congratulations to our organization. This is a testament to the team's efforts and as we work to get closer to our partners it's an early indication that we are on the right track. As we report our first quarter performance we are energized by how our transformation efforts are taking root. I am confident that by executing our strategy we are positioning the company to deliver high levels of organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder return.

Turning to the first quarter results. Our top line showed signs of stabilization with organic revenues down 1 point. Excluding the now divested infrastructure business organic revenue was flat as Engineered Fastening and DEWALT growth was offset by muted consumer and DIY demand. Adjusted gross margin was 29% up 590 basis points versus the first quarter of last year and 30 basis points above the second half of 2023. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56. Adjusted gross margin expansion and EPS growth were both supported by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. We are reiterating our 2024 full year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $3.50 up to $4.50 as well as our expected free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Pat will provide more color on this later in our presentation. On April 1 we completed the sale of STANLEY Infrastructure to Epiroc. We have already deployed net proceeds from the transaction to reduce short-term debt demonstrating our commitment to further strengthening our balance sheet. Looking forward in 2024 we expect mixed demand trends to persist across our businesses and we are driving supply chain cost improvements to expand margins deliver earnings growth and generate strong cash flow. At the same time we are funding investments designed to fuel targeted long-term growth and market share gains across our businesses. I want to thank our team members around the world for their contributions to the progress that we have made on our transformation journey and for their energy and focus as we continue to charge forward.

I will now pass it to Chris Nelson to review the business segment performance.

Chris Nelson: Thank you Don and good morning everyone. Beginning with Tools & Outdoor first quarter revenue was approximately $3.3 billion down 1% organically versus prior year as growth in DEWALT was more than offset by muted consumer and DIY demand which pressured volume. Pricing was relatively flat consistent with our expectations. Adjusted segment margin was 8.5% in the first quarter a 550 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2023. This was achieved through lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation savings and shipping cost reductions which were partially offset with targeted investments designed to accelerate share gain and organic growth. Now turning to the product lines.

Power tools was up 1 point organically led by pro-driven growth in DEWALT and international sales. We are also seeing benefits from a return to historic promotional levels on high margin DEWALT cordless. Organic revenue for hand tools declined 7% pressured by lower DIY demand. Outdoor product line organic revenue grew 2% in the quarter driven by strong demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment and incremental retail product listings. We are encouraged by U.S. retail point-of-sale data which showed an early start to the season versus prior year. We are cautiously optimistic that demand can be better than the last two years. Our visibility will improve as we move through the second quarter and hit key U.S. holidays. The independent dealer channel continues to work through significant on-hand inventory which pressured shipments in the quarter.

We are monitoring POS trends in this channel and currently expect that they can clear their inventory during the 2024 season to set up a stronger 2025. As Don alluded earlier the outdoor market remains soft versus 2019 volume levels. We are not standing still and are moving with speed to improve profitability by continuing to optimize our cost structure. Consistent with our overall strategy our intent is to focus resources towards capturing targeted share gain opportunities in the most profitable and attractive growth segments such as electric handheld outdoor power equipment. Turning to Tools & Outdoor performance by region. North America was down 2% organically driven by factors consistent with the overall segment. In Europe organic revenue was down 3% as declines in France and Germany were partially offset by growth in the Nordics and the UK.

We are making targeted investments in the region to expand professional product offerings and activate these innovations in the market to capture share. In aggregate all other regions were up 7% organically in the quarter driven by mid-teens growth in Latin America Brazil Mexico Central America and the Caribbean led this performance for the quarter. In summary for Tools & Outdoor we are acutely focused on successfully winning with our customers and winning with the Pro while making profitability improvements. We are navigating mixed market conditions with the goal to capitalize on the areas of strength. We are making deliberate investments in our brands market activation and innovation to capture the growth and margin opportunities that will contribute to the long-term shareholder returns.

I will now discuss our Industrial segment performance. First quarter industrial revenue declined 5% versus last year. Price realization of 1% across the segment and engineered passing volume growth was more than offset by infrastructure volume declines and a point of currency pressure. Within the Industrial segment Engineered Fastening organic revenue growth of 5% includes aerospace growth of 30% and auto growth of 4%. We believe we are outpacing customer production levels as a result of targeted share gains particularly in EV automotive. This growth was partially offset by market softness in general industrial fastening. Industrials adjusted segment margin was 12.1% an improvement of 110 basis points versus prior year driven by price realization and cost actions taken to improve productivity.

A toolbox filled with an array of different tools representing the professional products of the company.

This was a strong performance considering the infrastructure volume decline that the team faced. The quarter was a result of focused execution by our Industrial business associates. On behalf of the entire leadership team I'd like to thank our colleagues around the world for delivering another solid quarter of results and a strong start to the year. Now turning to the next slide. I would like to now highlight a few of our recent DEWALT product introductions which are the results of our investments in innovation. The new DEWALT 20-volt MAX XR cordless framing nailer is engineered for enhanced productivity and performs applications that are traditionally served by pneumatic tools. It is designed to allow the end user to sync framing nails consistently sub flush into LVL material and when used in rapid sequential mode ramp-up time is eliminated between shots.

DEWALT is also introducing the world's first 20-volt MAX cordless 2-1/4 Peak horsepower dedicated plunge router. It provides power like a corded midsized router with the convenience of a cordless tool a prime example of how we continue to help our Pro users transition to a cordless job site. Additionally our TOUGHSYSTEM 2.0 DXL workstation is the industry's first portable storage solution with a 30-inch platform that helps PROs maximize their productivity. This all-in-one workstation delivers customizable mobile storage and a functional work top that is unlike anything else currently available for commercial construction job sites. These are just a few examples of how we continue driving our innovation engine in a manner that is centered on the professional with the intent of making our users more productive.

We believe these innovations coupled with our investments in brand and market activation will stimulate share gains. As we celebrate the DEWALT 100-year anniversary we also reflect on our responsibility and commitment to serving the trades people around the world with brands like DEWALT Craftsman and STANLEY. Thank you and I'll now pass the call over to Pat Hallinan.

Pat Hallinan: Thanks Chris and good morning. Turning to the next slide. I would like to highlight the progress we've made along our transformation journey in the first quarter. We achieved approximately 145 million pre-tax run rate cost savings in the period bringing our aggregate savings to approximately 1.2 billion since program inception. As we focus our portfolio streamline our business structure and transform our operations our teams are actively identifying and prioritizing opportunities to further optimize our cost structure. Given the dynamic macro environment we continue to refine and mobilize plans to deliver targeted savings. We are confident in our ability to execute those plans. We continue to target $1.5 billion of pre-tax run rate savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion pre-tax run rate cost savings by the end of 2025.

Strategic sourcing remains the largest contributor to our transformation savings to date. We are leveraging savings on the $5 billion of addressable spend across areas such as materials and components finished goods and indirect expenditures. Our operations excellence program which leverages lean manufacturing principles is driving productivity improvements. The scope of this work stream improves efficiency and effectiveness within our production and distribution facilities. A pipeline of projects is robust with initiatives lined up to deliver efficiency gains in 2024 and beyond. Footprint-related projects and product platforming which are more event-driven will become increasingly important throughout the remainder of our transformation.

We are optimizing our distribution footprint as well as redesigning our manufacturing network to leverage centers of excellence and to optimize our operations. This multiyear endeavor is accelerating in 2024 as we plan to exit or transform a number of facilities across the globe during 2024 and 2025. And -- the manufacturing sites we previously announced for closure have ceased production and we expect to exit these sites in the near future. We continue to execute manufacturing footprint changes during the first quarter which affected five sites with the goal to complete the site modifications this year. Regarding product platforming this initiative will unlock value by reducing complexity across our value chain. This savings initiative identifies various parts and components that can be standardized across a product family which eliminates complexity and improves procurement scale.

In aggregate our supply chain transformation initiatives are expected to generate approximately $0.5 billion of savings in 2024 improving margins and generating resources for additional growth investments in our core business. We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments. Moving to the next slide. We continue prioritizing free cash flow generation and gross margin expansion to support long-term growth and value creation. First quarter free cash outflow was in line with typical historical trends due to seasonal account receivable increases. This quarter our inventory control contained the working capital build to approximately 360 million where we've traditionally averaged a roughly 700 million increase in the first quarter of the year.

Days of inventory is now approximately 150 days an improvement of 10 days versus the prior year and moving toward our long-term target of approximately 120 to 130 days. We used the net proceeds from the infrastructure sale to reduce our commercial paper balance in the beginning of the second quarter. Because this occurred subsequent to the first quarter close it is not reflected in the first quarter balance sheet. We remain focused on working capital optimization and profitability improvement to generate strong free cash flow in 2024. For the full year 2024 we plan to reduce inventory by $400 million to $500 million as we continue prioritizing working capital efficiency. CapEX is expected to range between $400 million to $500 million which includes support for the footprint-related transformation initiatives.

These items combined with organic cash generation support our full year free cash flow range of $600 million to $800 million which is unchanged from our guidance communicated earlier in the year. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent investing in organic growth and our transformation funding our long-standing commitment to return value to shareholders through cash dividends and further strengthening our balance sheet. Turning to profitability. Adjusted gross margin of 29% in the first quarter improved 590 basis points versus prior year driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and lower shipping costs. We expect to increase adjusted gross margin sequentially in each half of 2024 and we are planning for total company adjusted gross margin to approximate 30% for the full year.

We continue to expect to exit the year at an adjusted gross margin rate in the low 30s. We are off to a solid start in 2024 and the hard work we've done to make adjusted gross margin progress allows us to fund incremental investments to accelerate long-term organic revenue growth. Now turning to the 2024 guidance and the remaining key assumptions. In addition to the free cash flow guidance I just covered we are reiterating GAAP earnings per share range of $1.60 to $2.85 and an adjusted earnings per share range of $3.50 to $4.50. We are maintaining the range of organic revenue assumptions to be plus or minus low single digits. We believe the most likely outcome for organic revenue is to be flat to down 1%. At this level we expect to achieve the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range through cost controls.

Our view incorporates modest headwinds in aggregate for our markets and we remain focused on gaining share in this environment. We are maintaining a disciplined approach to cost management and remain committed to funding investments for long-term organic growth. Turning to the segments. Tools & Outdoor organic revenue is expected to be plus or minus low single digits most likely below flat consistent with the total company. The Industrial segment organic revenue is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Infrastructure's first quarter decline will impact the segment's full year organic growth. And now that the deal is closed we will report the divestiture revenue impact quarterly. Our planning assumption for growth investments is approximately an incremental $100 million in 2024.

These are designed to accelerate innovation market activation and to support our powerful DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley brands. This should result in 2024 SG&A as a percentage of sales in the mid-21% zone for the full year. We will remain agile with the pace of investments should the demand outlook swing in or out of our favor. Turning to profitability. We expect total company adjusted EBITDA margin to approximate 10% for the full year supported by the benefits of the transformation program. Segment margin in Tools & Outdoor is planned to be up year-over-year also driven by continued momentum from our ongoing strategic transformation. The Industrial segment margin is expected to be flat to slightly positive versus prior year as operating improvement in Engineered Fastening is offset by the dilution from the infrastructure business divestiture.

Our adjusted EPS range remains $1 with variability in market demand being the largest contributor we will work to optimize adjusted gross margin and manage SG&A thoughtfully throughout the year to balance the macro uncertainty while working hard to preserve investments to position the business for longer-term growth. Turning to other elements of guidance. GAAP earnings include pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments ranging from $290 million to $340 million largely relating to the supply chain transformation program with approximately 25% of these expenses being noncash footprint rationalization costs. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to be 10% for 2024 with the second and third quarters in the low 30s. Discrete tax planning items are expected to reduce the full year rate and primarily impact the fourth quarter.

Other 2024 guidance assumptions at the midpoint are noted on the slide to assist with modeling. We expect the second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be approximately 21% to 22% of the full year at the midpoint. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter as a percentage of the full year is expected to exceed 25% with EPS contribution lower due to the quarterly tax profile. In summary we continue to make progress on our transformation journey with an unwavering focus on gross margin expansion cash generation balance sheet strength and share gains in a soft market. We are confident that successful execution of our strategy can position the company for long-term growth and value creation. With that I will now pass the call back to Don.

Don Allan: Thank you Pat. As we report another quarter of progress our consistent execution against our plan is building momentum and energizing our team. As our profitability continues to improve we are focusing organic growth investments behind our most powerful brands particularly DEWALT Craftsman and Stanley. We believe these investments can enable organic growth to outpace the market by 2x to 3x. Stanley Black & Decker continues to become a more streamlined business built on the strength of our people and culture with an intensified emphasis on our core market leadership positions in Tools and Outdoor and Engineered Fastening. We are focused on consistent execution while positioning the company to deliver higher levels of sustainable organic revenue growth profitability and cash flow to drive strong long-term shareholder returns. With that we are now ready for Q&A Dennis.

Dennis Lange: Great. Thanks Don. Shannon we can now start the Q&A please. Thank you.

EASTHAMPTON — The world’s largest coffee chain plans to add another shop in western Massachusetts this summer.

The city’s Planning Board has unanimously approved a special permit to construct and operate a drive-thru Starbucks. The shop would be built on a proposed 37276-square-foot subdivision of the 32.78-acre property at 93 Northampton St. between Burger King and Tasty Top.

The resulting two parcels meet the 120-foot frontage requirement called for by city ordinances and are accessible from a public way according to City Planner Jeff Bagg. The property is owned by Dennis M. Courtney trustee of a family trust that owns the land.

This portion of the property where the Starbucks will be located has been used as a golf driving range a gravel parking lot and a 205-square-foot building designated for rental of golf equipment.

Originally listed as 93-99 Northampton St. the property has attracted a few proposals in the past few years including a Stop & Shop plaza and a marijuana business.

When Stop & Shop halted its plans Courtney listed the property in November 2018 for $3 million.

This past summer Tasty Top located at what’s now 97 Northampton St. reopened to the community under new management with Nick Dulude leasing the property from Courtney. According to a previous report by the Gazette the property survived a planned demolition and seven years sitting vacant. Future plans for the Tasty Top were not immediately clear this week.

With the proposal the building for rental of golf equipment will be razed to make room for the construction of the 2217-square-foot drive-thru establishment that includes an off-street lot with 33 parking spaces.

One of the big concerns that the Planning Board had with the planned Starbucks is traffic. At previous meetings the board voiced concerns about long delays for cars exiting and turning left which could create a queuing of cars that could potentially spill out onto Northampton Street.

“The only concern was the potential for arriving cars to extend into Northampton Street” Bagg wrote in an email to the Gazette. “They’ve added a separate exit lane which will resolve the issue.”

Starbucks (SBUX -0.55%) is enjoying a spike in demand for its coffee beverages even compared to soaring sales results a year ago. While that boost would normally be great news it has strained many of the chain's stores beyond their capacity.

Howard Schultz who recently stepped back into the CEO spot said this week that Starbucks is struggling to catch up to huge changes in the way shoppers are interacting with its brand today.

Let's look at that shift and Starbucks' plan for getting back ahead of consumer demand for its beverages.

Drive-thru and delivery

Shoppers prioritized home delivery drive-thru and mobile ordering during earlier phases of the pandemic and that shift has only accelerated even as social distancing restrictions fade. In fact Starbucks saw a 30% spike in delivery demand over the past two quarters.

More than two-thirds of its store orders occur in the drive-thru lane or on smartphones today rather than in face-to-face interactions at the counter. Starbucks was surprised by that shift and the pandemic also made it harder to invest in building a better infrastructure to support it.

The result has been a drop in service levels. Schultz said higher demand plus ""algorithms built for different customer behaviors has placed tremendous strain on our U.S. partners.""

Changing investment priorities

Now we know more about why Starbucks decided to pause stock buyback spending. Schultz sees the chain as far behind in needed investments in things like wages training and new drive-thru locations. The chain is hoping to implement handheld device checkouts and better store designs too that should speed service back up.

Most of the cash will go toward the digital platform though with improvements to the loyalty program mobile ordering and payment and home delivery on the way. While Schultz estimates that the company gains about a 10% return from stock buyback spending its returns are far higher in these other areas. ""With Starbucks' treasure trove of global assets a 10% return is not satisfactory to me"" he said.

Righting the ship

Starbucks didn't mention competition in its call with investors and that's likely added to the market share pressure that the company is feeling today. Rivals like Dunkin' and McDonald's are eager to pounce on any opening the company leaves in the coffee and to-go food niches.

It's also unclear whether Starbucks is losing some of its market power at a time when most consumers are opting for quick service over a café experience. Fast-food titan McDonald's might be better-suited for this environment given its grip on the drive-thru niche.

But the good news is that demand is still strong for Starbucks' products. And there's over $1 billion sitting on pre-paid Starbucks cards waiting to be spent at its stores. ""We have demand everywhere we look"" Schultz said.

The company's challenge now is to meet that demand while raising the bar so that its customers and employees are as happy with their experiences as they have been in the past. ""We must reintroduce joy in the customer and emotional connection back into the partner experience"" Schultz said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsaXRlZGFpbHkuY29tL25ld3Mvd2hhdC1pcy10cmlwbGUtc3Rhci1kYXktc3RhcmJ1Y2tz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Is Triple Star Day At Starbucks?

Starbucks Rewards members get many chances during the year to earn more Stars than 1 or 2 Stars per purchase (depending on purchase method). From seasonal games to using a Starbucks Visa to earn to preload your digital Starbucks card to in-app challenges Starbucks runs can be even more rewarding. One of the most exciting ways to earn Stars is Triple Star Day which was implemented in 2020. Here’s what to know about the once-per-year chance at three times the Stars.

What Is Triple Star Day At Starbucks?

ICYDK Starbucks’ Triple Star Day is all about rewarding customers with even more offers and opportunities to earn Stars. During the special one-day promo Starbucks Rewards members have the chance to snag triple Stars on almost every order using one of the qualifying purchase methods. Of course you’ll need to be a Rewards member to take part in Triple Star Day and if you aren’t you can join the loyalty program for free by downloading the Starbucks app or creating an account on Starbucks.com. Once you’re all set up you can earn Stars when you make qualifying purchase through order ahead and pay on the Starbucks App or by scanning your Starbucks Rewards account when ordering in participating Starbucks locations.

When Is Triple Star Day At Starbucks?

Though Starbucks hasn’t officially announced its Triple Star Day for 2022 the promo’s past dates can give us a clue to around when it’ll arrive. Starbucks has had two Triple Star Days before — the first Triple Star Day kicked off on Thursday Oct. 1 2020. Then Starbucks brought back Triple Star Day for its second year on Thursday Oct. 21 2021. Since both past Triple Star Days have been on a Thursday in October it’s likely that the one-day promo will also fall on the same day and month in 2022 — so mark your calendars for October and get ready to make a big order to really rack up the Stars.

If you think of summer what fruit comes to mind? In Japan you might first think of watermelon. In Taiwan it would be mango. That’s why according to our Taiwan-based Japanese-language reporter Yui Imai you’ll find mango-flavored sweets in restaurants all over the island starting in April which is just when the weather starts to get hot.

Naturally Starbucks is the same and on April 15 they started selling their new limited-edition Mango on the Beach Frappuccino which even comes with chocolate shaped like a beach umbrella! With a bright summery look to it reminiscent of a sandy beach Yui just had to go and try it out.

That beachy vibe was the core of the Frappuccino’s appeal. The vibrant orange color which practically screamed summer had some darker oranges mixed in thanks to the mango jelly at the bottom of the cup and the mango jam blended into the Frappuccino. Of course like all Frappuccinos it was topped with whipped cream but it also had whole wheat flour cookie crumbles sprinkled on top. And let’s not forget the chocolate beach umbrella! It was such a playful Starbucks drink and Yui was excited to try the exuberant mango flavors the sunny orange color promised.

She tried the chocolate umbrella first since it looked in danger of toppling out of the quickly softening whipped cream. It made a nice snapping sound when Yui bit into it and had a faint sweetness that reminded her of her childhood.

The drink itself had a super tropical flavor like drinking mixed fruit juice but it also a nice chilly creaminess that overtook her taste buds. The soft yet firm texture of the jelly was a pleasant surprise! It seemed to be made of mango juice which somehow condensed the sticky sweetness of mango into jelly form. The texture gave the jelly a sense of presence that was so impressive that Yui actually wanted to try it on its own.

Naturally whipped cream was the perfect dressing for this drink; it made the overall Frappuccino even milkier. The crunchy texture of the whole-wheat-flour cookie crumbles offered a nice accent to the softness of the cream too.

Both tropical and creamy this Frappuccino felt like it was the perfect drink for a hot summer day. It’s available in three sizes: Tall (145 yuan/635 yen/US$4.92) Grande (165 yuan) and Venti (185 yuan). Yui ordered the Tall size which has a calorie count of 368 which Yui thought was a moderate amount. If you find yourself in Taiwan this summer you’ll definitely want to try it out! And don’t forget to try their Strawberry Mango Oolong Tea too!

The City of St. Charles School District was one of 47 districts Schmitt sued earlier this year over mask mandates and it was one of only three cases that the attorney general’s office had refused to dismiss.

Judge Daniel Pelikan on Thursday sided with the district which had argued that since it had rescinded its masking policy the lawsuit was moot.

“Attorney General Schmitt is wasting judicial resources and public funds to continue litigation regarding a policy that the district completely rescinded” the district wrote in an April filing to dismiss the case.

Chris Bennett the school district’s spokesman said from the onset of the lawsuit it was clear that “our Board of Education has the authority invested in it by the voters of our district and state law to enact health protocols to protect our students staff and community and this dismissal confirms that fact.”

However Schmitt claims credit for the district changing its mask rules — even though the district’s board of education moved to drop its mask mandate in March weeks after the lawsuit had been filed in January.

“The aim of our litigation was to put an end to mask mandates in schools” said Chris Nuelle Schmitt’s spokesman “and because of our litigation St. Charles School District has dropped its mask mandate and our litigation was successful.”

The ruling against the attorney general’s office leaves just two cases where it is still pursuing judgments against districts’ masking rules.

Like the St. Charles District Columbia Public Schools no longer has a mask mandate in place and also has moved to dismiss the case. Arguments on the district’s motion will be heard later this month.

Last week a St. Louis County judge heard arguments on the University City School District’s motion to dismiss Schmitt’s lawsuit against the district’s mask mandate.

Meanwhile the Lee’s Summit School District has refused to let Schmitt dismiss the case and filed a counterclaim of its own. The district is asking a judge to declare the attorney general overstepped his authority by ordering schools to cease their masking requirements.

Fixing state law

As Schmitt has continued to pursue cases against school districts in the courts he’s simultaneously worked with state lawmakers to change the law the wave of lawsuits was based on.

On Wednesday Rep. Nick Schroer R-O’Fallon added an amendment to a Senate bill that would make clear that schools can’t require masks or face coverings for students.

Rep. Jim Murphy R-St. Louis said the provision was language that had been brought to lawmakers by Schmitt. Murphy sponsored legislation last year that became part of the basis for House Bill 271 which set time limits and regulations on the renewal of health orders.

In school districts’ filings opposing Schmitt’s lawsuits they’ve argued that the definition of a “political subdivision” cited in the state law does not apply to school districts.

Schroer’s amendment would strike the statute reference that has become a point of contention — while more broadly barring districts from requiring masks.

“Obviously we need to put an end to all the ambiguity to this” Murphy said on the House floor Wednesday “because we don’t want our state officials suing our schools.”

Schmitt’s office declined to comment on the proposed legislative changes.

Murphy removed language that would have barred local governments and public officials from claiming sovereign immunity or official immunity if sued under the amendment’s provisions.

“‘Who would run for school board if they thought that everything they did would result in them being civilly liable for it” Murphy said he told the attorney general’s office. “I said ‘That’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard.’”

The provisions would also stipulate that schools cannot require students to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to attend school or extracurricular activities. It also would prohibit requirements to wear face masks or undergo COVID testing as an alternative to being vaccinated.

The amendment Schroer said “gets us back to letting our kids learn.”

Other provisions would also stipulate that 60 days after a health order is issued during a state of emergency that limits attendance or requires masks only the director of the state health department would be authorized to extend the order or issue a new one — not the local governing body.

Local governing bodies could not issue orders relating to a pandemic unless the governor has directed the state health department director to authorize them to — and the state health director would be permitted to review and change those orders.

During a pandemic only the state health director would also be permitted to close or restrict the operations of a school “or other place of public or private assembly.”

“This strips out local control” said. Rep. Patty Lewis D-Kansas City who voted against the amendment.

Schroer’s amendment was ultimately adopted by a vote of 94 to 46. It was added onto a bill sponsored by Sen. Doug Beck a St. Louis County Democrat and vocal critic of Schmitt’s legal crusade against school mask mandates.

Beck sponsored legislation this session that would have stipulated attorney’s fees be awarded to school districts if a lawsuit brought by the attorney general ends in the school district’s favor and such fees would come out of the attorney general office’s budget.

With dozens of amendments added to his bill in the House Beck said there will be many that will have to come off in conference committee to bring the bill back to its original purpose — which dealt with health care plans for students with epilepsy or seizure disorders.

Beck said it’s wrong for Schmitt to try to revise the law that’s been the basis for lawsuits against schools’ mask mandates.

“The AG’s time should be better suited to actually do the things that my constituents call us all the time about” Beck said “…instead of attacking our local kids teachers our local governments that are perfectly suited to make these decisions.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGF1Z3VzdGluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9oaXN0b3J5LzIwMjIvMDUvMDcvd2Vlay1zdC1qb2hucy1jb3VudHktaGlzdG9yeS0zLWZ1Z2l0aXZlcy1pbmRpY3RlZC1mc3Utc3R1ZGVudHMtZGVhdGgvOTY1MDEyNTAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Week in St. Johns County History: Fugitives indicted in FSU student's death in 2010,"St. Augustine Record

Editor's note: This story by Richard Prior was written May 11 2010.

A St. Johns County grand jury has indicted three escaped convicts from Louisiana for kidnapping and first-degree murder in the death of Florida State University student Vincent John Binder.

The indictments were returned Tuesday against Peter Marcus Hughes Kentrell F. Johnson and Quentin M. Truehill according to State Attorney R.J. Larizza's Office.

Public Information Officer Christopher Kelly said the State Attorney's Office had not yet decided whether to seek the death penalty.

""We will announce that decision at the appropriate time"" Kelly said.

The three men who reportedly escaped from an Avoyelles Parish La. jail on March 30 are in custody in Tallahassee on a charge of kidnapping to facilitate a felony.

""Everybody is working together and the logistics are being discussed now"" he said.

Binder a 29-year-old graduate student was last seen walking home from a friend's house in Tallahassee on April 2. His body was found April 29 in a remote field near State Road 16 and Interstate 95 in St. Johns County.

The three fugitives reportedly robbed two people before they came upon Binder. They are said to have used his debit card in Madison County to buy gas and again in Jacksonville at ATMs and gas stations before heading south.

In Opa-locka just north of Miami a bank clerk became suspicious when a black man tried to use a card belonging to a white man the Tallahassee Democrat reported.

A security guard wrote down the license tag of the fugitives' stolen truck. That helped U.S. marshals find them hiding out in Miami according to the Tallahassee paper.

One of the fugitives Kentrell Johnson reportedly told authorities that his co-defendants forced Binder into the truck intending to rob him.

Johnson allegedly told investigators that Hughes and Truehill later led Binder into some woods then returned without him.

Authorities in Louisiana said Truehill was serving 30 years for manslaughter and armed robbery Hughes four years for unlawful entry into an inhabited dwelling and Johnson 10 years for armed robbery and a parole violation.

Kelly said he wasn't sure when the men would be brought to St. Johns County since there are ""a number of law enforcement agencies and state attorney offices"" interested in them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sdWJib2Nrb25saW5lLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvY29sbGVnZS9iYXNlYmFsbC8yMDIyLzA1LzA3L3N0LWVkd2FyZHMtb3V0bGFzdHMtbGN1LTIwLTE3LWZpbmlzaGVzLXN3ZWVwLWNvbmZlcmVuY2UtdG91cm5hbWVudC85Njg2MDIxMDAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,St. Edward's sweep puts LCU season in limbo,"No commitment required.

LOUIS – A magnitude 2.8 earthquake rattled the St. Louis County area near Valley Park on April 29. Is the seismic activity in this area something that should concern us? The research may surprise you.

What You Need To Know St. Louis County experienced a 2.8 magnitude earthquake on April 29 2022



The earthquake is part of the New Madrid Seismic Zone the Illinois Basin-Ozark Dome



There were four quakes in the St. Louis region in a 40-year span



The North American Plate is drifting west an inch to inch and a half per year

April 29 2022

It was around 5:30 p.m. on April 29 when the ground seemed to shake. Amy Blumenfeld of St. Louis County was standing in her kitchen and noticed her 5-pound dog Capulet a Bichon Frise just sort of fell over onto the floor. Items on top of her fridge rattled and she heard what sounded like a pop.

She questioned what it was thinking maybe a transformer blew somewhere in the area but she didn’t lose power. Turns out it was a 2.8 magnitude earthquake with an epicenter just south of Valley Park Missouri.

“I live very close to Valley Park where the shock was reported to be felt so strongly. This was the first earthquake I’ve ever actually been able to feel even though I’ve been in town when others have been reported. Neighbors immediately came outside on porches/decks to look and see what happened.”

Earthquakes occur in the St. Louis region but not all that often. This quake was part of the Illinois Basin–Ozark Dome which includes Missouri Illinois Indiana Kentucky and Arkansas and extends to the more active New Madrid Seismic Zone located closer to the bootheel of Missouri.

Social media impact

Social media was a buzz with posts of “did you feel the shaking?” Or even ring cameras that captured the slight movement of household items.

Kenny Stempel of Chesterfield Valley in St. Louis County posted on Facebook “Ahhhhhh! Earthquake!!! Just kidding it was only a 2.5.” Having moved here from Los Angeles 2.5 years ago he’s encountered his fair share of quakes but unlike the 6+ magnitude quakes of California this one was quite minor.

Californians may have chuckled at the magnitude of this quake but midwestern quakes differ from western quakes. The quakes don’t always occur along a fault. They are shallower and with a shallow quake felt a longer distance up to 10 times farther than their western counterparts.

How this earthquake happened

Washington University in St. Louis geophysics professor Michael Wysession explains that unlike oceanic earthquakes land earthquakes don’t go deep. That’s because the pressure prevents them.

The earthquakes that occur in the middle of continents like this one happen in part because of the North American plate drifting westward around an inch to inch and a half per year. He used an analogy of an old wooden ship moving along the waves.

“As it goes you hear the creaking and the groaning of the boards and the mast and that’s exactly what North America does. We’re moving westward and the mantle is lumpy and as this hundred-mile-thick sheet of rock moves westward across the mantle it flexes and bends a little bit.”

He adds “This quake could also be attributed to a weak spot on the North American plate which is common as these plates have drifted together and apart for millions of years.”

Geological activity in this area is recent

Activity in this area including the New Madrid Seismic Zone is quite new only around 200 years.

“First seismic activity was 1811 and 1812 in New Madrid where there were three big ones… 6.7 6.8 7.2. However the magnitudes are estimated because the first seismometer recording of an earthquake didn’t actually happen until 1889.”

Information from local newspapers discussing the shaking and damage helped scientists approximate the magnitudes.

Asked whether fracking can be a reason for the minor earthquakes Wysession says there is no fracking that occurs in the St. Louis area now.

Fracking was common in northern Arkansas and the cluster of quakes in Arkansas was the first discovered as fracking-related not the actual fracking part but the pumping of the wastewater that caused thousands of minor quakes.

Future seismic activity

Whether we can expect more shaking in the St. Louis region soon he explains “Earthquakes tend to follow a fractal dimension of one for the way we determine the magnitude scale."" He used New Madrid as an example.

""For the last 150 years we’ve had one magnitude 6 10 magnitude 5s roughly 100 magnitude 4s. If you come up to St. Louis region where that earthquake occurred near Valley Park we had only had three other earthquakes in that region over the last 40 years and they were all around 2.8” he explained.

Based on these statistics we can expect a minor quake once every decade.

Earthquake insurance

This earthquake happened when homeowners opting for earthquake insurance in the state are at an all-time low. Premiums typically are about $200-$300 a year in our area.

When asked if earthquake insurance is something folks should purchase in this region Wysession said “The risk is low.”

“Insurance is all about how comfortable you are with risk"" he added. ""It’s the sleep test. Can you sleep at night?”

He points out that back in 1811 and 1812 “there were about 5000 people living in St. Louis. Loose chimneys in St. Louis fell over yet there was almost no damage in towns half the distance like St. Genevieve which should have shaken more violently yet not a pane of glass was broken.”"

Judges Tim Cheatham Dave Moretti and Steve Weisfeld all scored the bout 115-113 for Russia's Bivol who successfully defended his World Boxing Assn. light-heavyweight title and improved to 20-0.

""I proved myself today. I'm the best"" Bivol said in the ring. ""He's a great champion. I respect him. (But) if you don't believe in yourself you'll never achieve.

""If you believe you achieve what you want.""

Bivol said that while Alvarez ""hurt my arm"" he also only ""loaded up big punches"" freeing Bivol to unleash a steady attack led by his effective jab and featuring a steady offering of powerful combinations that backed up Alvarez and fatigued the naturally lighter pound-for-pound No. 1 fighter in the world.

""He's a great champion. I lost. He won"" Alvarez (57-2-2) said. ""He's a very good fighter. He comes in goes out ... . He managed his distance really well. That's boxing.""

Alvarez said he will opt to invoke his rematch clause. His loss takes away plans for a September trilogy fight against Gennadiy Golovkin.

***

In the co-main event Cleveland’s Montana Love toned down the drama of opposing knockdowns in the first two rounds and out-boxed Gabriel Gollaz through the bout’s remainder claiming victory by three scores of 114-112.

Love met Gollaz with a knockdown punch in the first round smacking him on top of the head as the Mexican lunged forward. But Love’s confidence was deflated early in the second when Gollaz decked Love with a left to the face.

But the action veered to jeers from there drawing complaints by a crowd craving more action before the main event.

Love improved to 18-0-1 in the 140-pound bout.

Chinese heavyweight Zhang Zhilei (24-0-1 19 KOs) opened the pay-per-view portion of the card by delivering a massive left hand to the face knocking out Scott Alexander 1 minute 54 seconds into the first round. It was Zhang's fourth punch.

Lightweight Marc Castro repeatedly found Puerto Rico's Pedro Vicente with right hands cruising to a victory by three unanimous-decision scores of 60-54 improving to 7-0.

In a meeting of main-event stablemates Bivol’s Indio Calif.-based gym partner Shakhram Giyasov rode three knockdowns of Christian Gomez to win a unanimous decision by scores of 99-88 99-88 98-89.

Starting deliberately Giyasov (13-0) first dropped Gomez in the fourth round with a left hook to the head. Gomez who trains alongside Alvarez in San Diego rallied with some scoring blows in the fifth and sixth.

Giyasov then planted a right hand to the chin dropping Gomez again in the seventh before Gomez again recovered rapidly pressuring with a face shot that forced Giyasov to hold his foe’s waist in a bid to recover.

In the 10th a Giyasov combination punctuated by a right uppercut sent Gomez (22-3-1) to the canvas once more clinching the outcome.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0aW5nbmV3cy5jb20vdXMvYm94aW5nL25ld3MvY2FuZWxvLWFsdmFyZXotdnMtZG1pdHJ5LWJpdm9sLWxpdmUtcmVzdWx0cy1oaWdobGlnaHRzL29jZXh2eHltenN3eXhkN3ljc2E4dnBjMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Canelo Alvarez vs. Dmitry Bivol results: Bivol's size and skill turns back Canelo with unanimous decision,"LAS VEGAS -- Sometimes there are mountains that are too tall for even the greatest to climb. And that's what happened to Canelo Alvarez as Dmitry Bivol's size skill activity and tight defense turned back the Mexican superstar's attempt to collect more world titles with a brilliant performance that ended with a unanimous decision victory at T-Mobile Arena.

Bivol retained his WBA (Super) light heavyweight championship as he refused to bow down to Canelo's pressure and was technically sound enough to prevent making mistakes for Canelo to capitalize upon. Instead of being in awe of Canelo Bivol (20-0) used a stiff jab and kept busy whenever Canelo became aggressive. Canelo's power was evident but Bivol made sure very few punches landed clean as Canelo bounced power shots off his arms and gloves throughout.

Early on Canelo (57-2-2) attempted to walk down Bivol but the Russian sniffed out the strategy and would shoot the jab and carry a right hand behind it to keep Canelo from settling in with his power. As the rounds wore on Canelo was unable to break down his opponent and found himself in a real fight by the middle rounds. Whenever he did land a big power shot Bivol would tighten his defense up and ensure he wouldn't absorb another shot.

Bivol fought like he had the judges against him and keep throwing into the championship rounds. He caught Canelo flush several times but never seemed to have the 31-year-old in any real trouble. However the points were piling up and Canelo couldn't get the knockout or definitive rounds he needed.

With scores of 115-113 across the board Bivol pulled off the big upset as a 5 1/2 to 1 underdog. Not only that he dashed the possibility of Canelo-GGG in September as Canelo stated he wanted an immediate rematch.

Here's how it all went down.

Final Result: Dmitry Bivol def. Canelo Alvarez via unanimous decision. Scores were 115-113 115-113 & 115-113.

Love wins uneventful decision over Gollaz

11:14 p.m.: This undercard hasn't been great. It hasn't been good. Honestly it's been pretty bad. Love had a chance to put some life into this crowd but he's put together an uneven performance that consists of looking for the counter and circling. He's not having great success but will likely squeeze out a victory as they go the distance. The good news is that the main event is up next.

10:57 p.m.: Well what started off as a good fight has ended up becoming a stinker. Love has become extremely cautious and doesn't want to get countered while Gollaz has a significant reach advantage but refuses to throw his jab.

10:38 p.m.: Love and Gollaz have exchanged knockdowns in the first two rounds and are setting the pace for what could be an exciting fight. Love scored the first knockdown when he caught Gollaz coming in and Gollaz returned the favor with a similar counter in the second.

10:27 p.m.: The co-main event is up now as Montana Love faces Gabriel Gollaz in light welterweight action. Love is seemingly on the cusp of stardom and being placed in the co-main will only help enhance his profile should he have a good outing here tonight.

Giyasov drops Gomez twice pitches shutout

10:10 p.m.: Giyasov wasn't able to put Gomez away and Gomez did his best to get back into the fight but he was overmatched. The scores read 99-88 99-88 and 98-89 for Giyasov as he remains unbeaten.

9:43 p.m.: Giyasov just put Gomez down in the fourth round of a fight he is in control of. Although Gomez wasn't hurt too bad by the left hook Giyasov is stepping on the gas and it feels like he wants to put this one away sooner rather than later.

9:20 p.m.: Christian Gomez and Hakhram Giyasov are set to do battle in a ten-round welterweight bout next. The co-main event is after this and then Canelo-Bivol.

Castro schools Scharbaii with easy decision

9:07 p.m.: Marc Castro improved to 7-0 in his young career with an easy decision win over Pedro Vicente Scharbaii. Was it spectacular? Not really. But Castro is a good young prospect with impressive punch variety. One thing is for sure if Castro is going to compete with the upper crust of a loaded lightweight division he's going to have to tighten up that defense. Scharbaii touched him one too many times with punches that had no business connecting with someone like Castro.

8:39 p.m.: Up next is the talented Marc Castro squaring off with Pedro Vicente Scharbaai in lightweight action.

Zhang demolishes Alexander in one round

8:24 p.m.: Well that was expected. Zhang Zhile didn't play with his food and made sure to make short work of Scott Alexander in the opening bout on the PPV. Alexander stepped in on short notice after Filip Hrgovic pulled out due to the passing of his father and his presence in front of Zhang was...short. A straight left hand obliterated Alexander and put an end to the fight at the 1:54 mark of round one.

Alvarez (57-2-2 39 KOs) a four-division champion landed a career-low 84 punches overall overall 12 rounds as Bivol (20-0 11 KOs) relied on his defense and accurate punching to pull the upset via unanimous decision inside T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. All three judges scored it 115-113 for Bivol in a fight that appeared anything but competitive as CBS Sports scored it 119-109 in favor of Bivol.

""I'm sorry I ruined your plans [for a fall trilogy fight against] Gennadiy Golovkin maybe"" Bivol said. ""Congrats to [Alvarez] he's a great champion and I respect him. But if you don't believe in yourself what do you do? You won't achieve anything. I believe and my team believes.""

Six months after becoming the first undisputed super middleweight champion of the four-belt era Alvarez moved back up to 175 pounds for the first time since claiming the WBC title via knockout from Sergey Kovalev in 2019. But during the same week he teased a possible future move to heavyweight Alvarez was unable to break through the technical strength of Bivol a former Russian amateur star whose strength is muting the offense of his opponents.

Bivol's jab was on point throughout and he consistently responded to any single punch landed by Alvarez with clean combinations in return. Bivol allowed Alvarez to stand at close range in front of him but never gave him a clean enough strike zone to land upon.

Most of the damage Alvarez did connect on was to the left shoulder and arm of Bivol who stayed firm behind his high guard.

""I felt his power. As you can see from my arm he beat my arm up but not my head"" Bivol said. ""It's better. He had a good speed and power. Maybe his mistake was he threw only hard punches. After hard punches he relaxed and tired.

""I was feeling great. This was the biggest fight of my career and I enjoyed this fight. When the people booed me it gave me more energy.""

Alvarez whose previous lone defeat came against Floyd Mayweather in 2013 connected on just 17% of his punches against Bivol and was outlanded by a margin of 152 to 84 according to CompuBox. He also told reporters after that he thought he was ahead on the scorecards heading into the final rounds.

""He's a great champion. Sometimes in boxing you win or lose. I lost today and he won"" Alvarez said. ""He's a really good fighter. He's a fighter who comes in and goes out. I also felt his power. It was a good victory for him.""

After the fight Alvarez shared hopes for a rematch to which Bivol seemed willing.

""A rematch? No problem. Let's talk about a rematch"" Bivol said. ""I took this fight because I just wanted the opportunity and I appreciate the opportunity. I am ready for the rematch I just want to make sure I win and am treated like a champion now.""

For now it's unclear what comes next for Alvarez. The undisputed super middleweight champion was expected to face Gennadiy Golovkin in September to complete their trilogy but a potential rematch with Bivol could be in play as could another contender at either middleweight or super middleweight. One thing is for sure however this was Bivol's night and he'll be able to celebrate in kind.

The undercard saw some rising prospects take the next step in their development. Montana Love scored a knockdown and then suffered one of his own against Gabriel Gollaz en route to a decision win in the co-main event at junior welterweight. And 22-year-old Marc Castro cruised over six rounds to outpoint Pedro Vicente as the bantamweight slowly works his way toward higher levels of competition.

Again this does not mean Take-Two's premium games will be infused with NFTs. It's likely this addition references Zynga's ambitions to make play-to-earn games that use NFTs.

It's worth noting that WWE who has teamed up with 2K Games with annualized sports games has fully embraced NFTs. WWE chief brand officer Stephanie McMahon said: ""We also continue to evaluate the metaverse both walled garden environments that already exist as well as decentralized properties look to hear more in the coming months.""

Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has commented on NFTs and is open to the idea but only if it's ""well regulated"" provides value to customers and is open and honest.

""It's certainly going to happen and NFTs will take us there. The question is how do you do it in a way that you don't hurt your consumers. I have zero interest in creating some exchange that solely buys and sells Dutch tulips in the 1600s. That's what we're doing now with NFTs and cryptocurrency. ""We know where all speculations land. Some people will have made a lot of money gotten out in time and they'll have turned that money into fiat currency and be very happy about it and a whole lot of people will have lost a lot of money. ""So we're not going to create an economy to enable or enhance a speculative activity we would create an economy in service of making great entertainment experiences. Do I think NFTs could be in service to those goals and other game mechanics? ""Yes however are we going to bleed over into gambling--well not unless we're regulated and honest about it straightforward and even then I'm not sure it fits here but we're certainly not going to pretend a speculation is entertainment. Even if we could make money doing it.""

Take-Two Interactive makes a considerable portion of its net revenues from Recurrent Consumer Spending. In Q3 FY22 for example made 61% of its net revenues from RCS (see below).

According to Kotaku Zelnick will earn the money in terms of special bonuses. Aside from that the contract has also solidified his position as Take-Two's CEO until 2029. The contract refers to these bonuses from microtransactions as ""recurrent consumer spending"" (RCS) items.

As per the official definition of the company this includes digital add-on content virtual currency and other in-game items you can buy with real world money. What's going to happen here is that Zelnick will earn millions in stock bonuses should enough RCS items be sold. The reason is simple: the more money coming in the more Take-Two's stock goes up.

Considering how Zelnick is the current CEO of Take-Two Interactive it is safe to assume that he owns a considerable percentage of the company's shares.

The original report was shared by Axios who also mentioned that the contract is basically Take-Two's admittance that they're not going to stop putting microtransactions into their games. This will keep happening despite the constant backlash that these games get for the tons of microtransactions in them - with the ""NBA 2K"" series being the most notorious of them all.

This would also be not the first time that Zelnick netted millions in stock performance incentives. Last year he and company president Karl Slatoff both earned over $31 million from the same source.

But while this might sound a bit too much it's not that rare in the world of business. CEOs have almost always had the chance to earn bonuses if company stock goes up as a result of their leadership. This isn't even considering Take-Two's NASDAQ stock prices potentially going up in the future.

Either way keep buying VC in ""NBA 2K"" and Shark Cards in ""GTA Online"" and you'll make Strauss Zelnick richer and richer every year.

Microtransactions: Take-Two Interactive's Bread And Butter

Take away the considerable sales of games like ""GTA 5"" ""NBA 2K"" and others and Take-Two is still pulling a ton of cash just from microtransactions alone. In fact the amount of money they earn from these alone might just make your head spin.

From April to December last year the company was able to earn an insane $1.65 billion from microtransactions alone as reported to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In comparison full game purchases only netted them $890 million.

""GTA Online"" on its own was able to contribute around $600 million of revenue from microtransactions in 2019 reports PCGamer. The same thing goes for 2K Games who as a Take-Two subsidiary earned $410.7 million in microtransactions alone as reported by The Gamer.

The money looks to be great enough that despite a recent lawsuit involving microtransactions in ""NBA 2K"" Take-Two is still all-in on this universally hated business practice.

A bit ago Axios published a report outlining specific terms of Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick's pay structure. One interesting tidbit was how Zelnick and other executives like president Karl Slatoff are rewarded specifically if Recurrent Consumer Spending (RCS) grows.

Popular Now: Scientists use supercomputer to find out when humanity will perish

Here's the company's official definition of RCS: ""Recurrent Consumer Spending may generally include without limitation the sale of virtual currency add-on content microtransactions NFTs game related subscriptions offered directly by the Company and/or its subsidiaries and similar items but would not include full-game digital downloads.""

A quick note: Zelnick and Karl Slatoff actually advise Take-Two as part of Zelnick Media. Take-Two delivers four different kinds of awards and fees to Zelnick Media:

• Management fee - $22.5 million (thru 2029)

• Annual bonus

• RSU rewards: Includes Time-based awards and Performance-based awards

A recent SEC report notes that Recurrent Consumer Spending is actually 25% of the Performance-based RSU rewards. The other 75% is determined whether or not stock rises and by how much.

In short Strauss Zelnick and other employees of Zelnick Media are rewarded more for stock price increases and less for Recurrent Consumer Spending.

The stipulations can be tough. If total RCS growth is less than 3% the microtransaction-based bonus is $0. For reference Take-Two expects its FY2022 microtransaction revenues to slide by 5% year-over-year.

It's also worth mentioning that Strauss Zelnick cannot receive more than 60% of total compensation throughout any period. This includes management fees time- and performance-based RSUs and annual bonuses.

There seemed to be very few answers as to what was going on. (I guessed the revival of the Bennigan's Blarney Blast but apparently that was a pipe dream.)

Well it appears that the correct answer has been found.

Lafayette City Councilwoman Liz Webb Hebert took to Facebook today to inform everyone what she found out after contacting the store.

The answer is pretty simple -- it's an extensive remodel.

Here are the details sent to Councilwoman Hebert regarding the remodel:

Target Lafayette has been chosen for a state of the art Re-model which is now underway! Over the next few months we will be adding new product assortments updating fixtures and décor expanding key categories including local products and adding an Ulta Beauty inside our store! Target is thankful for the support of our Guests over the years from our Lafayette and surrounding communities and we are excited to be able to invest back into the community! Our newly re-modeled store will make it faster and safer than ever to shop in-store or by selecting many of our same day services such as On-line Order and Pick-up in store Drive Up or SHIPT. The inspiration for these re-models is always our Guests and we are excited to create an only-at-Target experience they can continue to turn to for years to come!

This sounds exciting although a few folks are curious as to why an Ulta Beauty would be added inside the store when there is one right across the street.

I'm sure that will all shake out somehow and if it means Ulta on both sides of the road then so be it.

I did see where Target opened 100 Ulta Beauty shops inside their stores in 2021 and had plans to open more than 250 new locations by the end of 2022.

Also in doing a little digging I found that this overall remodel is part of Target Corporation's remodel program with 200 top-to-bottom renovations of its existing fleet.

So it looks like one of our Lafayette Target locations is in that number.

""Years of investment in our team and business have driven our sales beyond $100 billion and positioned Target to meet the needs of our guests no matter how they choose to shop"" said Michael Fiddelke CFO of Target. ""We see substantial opportunities to build on our core capabilities to drive deeper guest engagement and long-term growth.""

We'll also pry a bit to find out when the renovations should be complete and how it will affect your shopping experience during the growing pains.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdGhld2Vlay5jb20vZmVhdHVyZS8xMDEzMjg3L3doZXJlLW1ham9yLWNvbXBhbmllcy1zdGFuZC1vbi1hYm9ydGlvbi1yaWdodHMtdGhlLXNjb3R1cy1sZWFr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where major companies stand on reproductive health care policies,"It's becoming increasingly difficult for companies to remain silent on controversial social issues — take the bitter LGBTQ-related standoff between The Walt Disney Company and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) as a recent example.

The latest blurring of the lines between business and politics however was sparked by the leaked draft majority opinion suggesting the Supreme Court is poised to overturn federal abortion rights as protected under 1973's Roe v. Wade. Here's where tech giants and leading businesses stand so far:

Airbnb: 'We will work to make sure our employees have the resources they need'

In a request for comment regarding the leaked opinion and its resulting expected effect on employee healthcare vacation rental company Airbnb told The San Francisco Standard that the company's ""healthcare coverage supports reproductive rights and we will work to make sure our employees have the resources they need to make choices about their reproductive rights as we committed to last fall"" in the wake of Texas' extreme six-week abortion ban.

Amazon: Up to $4000 a year in travel expenses

Amazon the nation's second-largest private employer has offered to cover up to $4000 a year in travel expenses for employees seeking non-threatening medical care including abortions if said care is unavailable within 100 miles of their residence and virtual care is not possible.

Apple: 'Actively monitoring the legal proceedings'

Tech giant Apple which has a large presence in Texas has said its health insurance covers both abortions and related travel fees. It appears Apple's policy has been in place since at least September 2021 when it confirmed to TechCrunch that it was keeping an eye on the legal challenges surrounding the Texas ban.

""We are actively monitoring the legal proceedings challenging the uniquely restrictive abortion law in Texas"" Apple wrote in an employee memo. ""In the meantime we want to remind you that our benefits at Apple are comprehensive and that they allow our employees to travel out-of-state for medical care if it is unavailable in their home state.""

Bumble and Match Group: 'We believe strongly in women's right to choose'

Online dating app Bumble commented on Monday's draft leak the following evening. ""The headlines today regarding the leaked draft opinion to overturn abortion rights in the United States are profoundly unsettling"" the company wrote on Twitter. ""At Bumble we believe strongly in women's right to choose and exercise complete control over their bodies.""

In September both Bumble and fellow dating app service Match Group separately announced they would each be launching relief funds for Texas employees in need of out-of-state abortion care. ""As I have said before the company generally does not take political stands unless it is relevant to our business"" Match Group CEO Shar Dubey said in a memo at the time. ""But in this instance I personally as a woman in Texas could not keep silent.""

Citigroup: A target of House Republicans

In March Citigroup became the first major bank to announce it would pay travel costs for employees affected by the abortion ban in Texas where it employs over 8000 workers. ""In response to changes in reproductive health care laws in certain states in the U.S. beginning in 2022 we provide travel benefits to facilitate access to adequate resources"" the bank said in a filing.

Citigroup subsequently came under fire for its decision; House Republicans urged the U.S. to cancel government contracts with the bank and a Texas lawmaker threatened to introduce a bill preventing Citigroup from underwriting municipal bonds.

CVS Health: 'We've made out-of-state care accessible and affordable'

In response to a request for comment on the draft opinion from Fortune CVS offered the following: ""We're monitoring the situation closely and evaluating how we can best support the coverage needs of our colleagues clients and consumers. We've made out-of-state care accessible and affordable for employees in states that have instituted more restrictive laws.""

Levi Strauss: 'Business leaders need to make their voices heard'

""Given what is at stake business leaders need to make their voices heard and act to protect the health and well-being of our employees"" Levi Strauss wrote in a statement released Wednesday. ""That means protecting reproductive rights."" The clothing brand is also reimbursing employees for travel expenses incurred while seeking health-care services unavailable in their state including abortions. Part-time hourly workers are able to seek reimbursement as well.

Salesforce: Helping employee families relocate out of Texas

Software company Salesforce offered in September to help employees and their families relocate out of Texas following the passage of its abortion law.

Salesforce did not take an explicit stance on the Texas law in its statement CNN noted at the time.

Uber and Lyft: Creating legal defense funds

Both Uber and Lyft each announced in September they'd be creating legal defense funds to help drivers sued under the Texas law which financially incentivizes and deputizes private citizens to sue anyone who aids or abets an abortion (including ride-sharing drives) after six weeks of pregnancy. Both companies recently extended the same coverage to drivers in Oklahoma.

Lyft also previously pledged to donate $1 million to Planned Parenthood. ""We've made our perspective on this quite clear"" Lyft co-founder and President John Zimmer told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday after the leak. ""So we will continue to look for ways to make a difference to speak out and to most importantly take action.""

UTA: 'The right to choose … has been a bedrock'

Hollywood's United Talent Agency also responded to the draft ruling by notifying its employees it would reimburse travel expenses related to reproductive health services unable to be accessed within their state. ""We're doing this to support the right to choose that has been a bedrock of settled law for almost half a century"" CEO Jeremy Zimmer said in a memo to employees. ""Several states have already introduced restrictive legislation and the draft Supreme Court ruling leaked yesterday if it comes to pass could make abortion illegal in more than half of the country.""

Yelp: 'Turning back the clock … will have a seismic impact'

Online review website Yelp has been outspoken in its opposition to an overruling of Roe warning such a decision from the court would have a ""seismic impact on our society and economy.""

""Turning back the clock on the progress women have made over the past 50 years will have a seismic impact on our society and economy"" Yelp continued in its statement on the matter. ""This goes against the will of the vast majority of Americans who agree that decisions around reproductive care should be made by women and their doctors."" The company also called on Congress to codify Roe into law.

Prior to the Monday evening leak Yelp had announced it would be covering expenses for employees and their spouses who must travel out of state for abortion care. The policy arrived in response to a restrictive six-week ban out of Texas but the benefit extends to employees in other states as well. Mirian Warren the company's chief diversity officer has said Yelp is not concerned about backlash.

Per a Wednesday report from The New York Times businesses who appear yet to directly comment on the draft ruling include PricewaterhouseCoopers Oracle JP Morgan Chase Walmart Disney ThirdLove Patagonia Kroger and Meta (though Sheryl Sandberg did post on Facebook writing that ""this is a scary day for women all across our country"").

Besides the ethanol target will not reduce earth-warming emissions drastically it may be detrimental to India's food security and will only help us inch towards energy security experts say.

Pros and Cons

Ethanol can be blended into petrol to reduce the quantity of petrol required to run a vehicle thus reducing dependency on imported costly and polluting petroleum. Today India imports 85% of its oil requirements.

India's net import of petroleum was 185 million tonnes in 2020-21 at a cost of $551 billion according to a roadmap for ethanol blending released by NITI Aayog the Centre's policy think-tank in June 2021. Most of the petroleum products are used in transportation and therefore the E20 programme can save the country $4 billion (Rs 30000 crore) annually.

Besides ethanol is a less polluting fuel and offers equivalent efficiency at a lower cost than petrol. Availability of large arable land rising production of foodgrains and sugarcane leading to surpluses availability of technology to produce ethanol from plant-based sources and the feasibility of making vehicles compliant to ethanol blended petrol (EBP) are some of the supporting arguments used in the roadmap for E20 which refers to the target as ""not only a national imperative but also an important strategic requirement"".

However increasing production of food-based feedstock for ethanol manufacturing may not be the best use of land in a hungry country IEEFA contends. India ranked 101 of 116 countries on the World Hunger Index 2021 . Further land can be used far more efficiently for generating renewable power for Electric Vehicles (EV) than for growing crops for ethanol.

For example you need 187 hectares worth of maize-derived ethanol to match the annual travel distance of an EV recharged from one hectare of solar energy--even accounting for losses from electricity transmission battery charging and grid storage stated the IEEFA report authored by Charles Worringham an Australia-based independent researcher.

Independent experts also believe that existing ethanol production based on surpluses or damaged foodgrains can be maintained at status quo or at E10 (10% ethanol-blended petrol) but the E20 target may be a misplaced priority for India.

What consumers gain and what they lose

Ethanol is one of the principal biofuels naturally produced by the fermentation of sugars by yeasts or via petrochemical processes. In India it is primarily produced from sugarcane-based raw materials or certain types of heavy molasses sugarcane juice/sugar/sugar syrup surplus rice available with the Food Corporation of India and maize. These are known as first generation biofuels.

Since the beginning of the EBP programme in 2003 average blending ranged only in the 0.1% to 1.5% range upto 2013-14. The NITI Aayog lists a number of interventions by the government post that period including eased tender conditions an interest subvention scheme--a financial support scheme for distilleries--for augmentation of production capacity and more owing to which average ethanol blending in the country reached 5% in Ethanol Supply Year (ESY) 2019-20. An ESY is from December of a given year to November of the next year.

In ESY 2021-22 India has achieved 9.45% ethanol blending as on March 13 2022. The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG) aims to take this to 10% in ESY 2021-22 and in December 2020 the government advanced its target of achieving 20% blending from 2030 to 2025. But this target comes with challenges.

Ethanol can be used in vehicles calibrated to that particular degree of ethanol blending (for eg E20) or in flex fuel vehicles that can run on pure fossil fuel or fossil fuels blended with any degree of biofuels.

There is a long way for vehicles to be E20 compatible. Vehicles made in India since 2008 are material-compatible (rubber and plastic components) with E10 and fuel-efficient compliant with E5 (5% ethanol blended in petrol) but their engines are not tuned to E10 for optimum performance. At the next stage when E10 petrol is made available across the country new vehicles will need engine modifications.

Besides when using E20 there is an estimated loss of 6-7% fuel efficiency for four-wheelers which are originally designed for regular petrol and calibrated for E10; 3-4% loss for two-wheelers designed for regular unblended petrol and calibrated for E10 and 1-2% loss for four-wheelers designed for E10 and calibrated for E20. To offset this the government might have to consider tax incentives on E10 and E20 fuel.

Also the cost of flex fuel vehicles (four-wheelers) would be Rs 17000 to Rs 25000 higher and of two-wheeled flex fuel vehicles Rs 5000 to Rs 12000 higher compared to ordinary vehicles tailored to run on 100% gasoline. The cost of E20 compatible vehicles is also expected to be higher by Rs 3000 to Rs 5000 for four-wheelers and Rs 1000 to Rs 2000 for two-wheelers. This level of modification and calibration of vehicles will require large scale investment in infrastructure.

""We estimate that 162 million motorised two-wheelers and 4.2 million three-wheelers on road use petrol"" said Himani Jain senior programme lead at the New-Delhi based think-tank Council on Energy Environment and Water (CEEW). ""Retrofitting the engines of such an enormous existing vehicle stock across India will require competent skilled technicians at scale strategic and early planning of required infrastructure and robust monitoring systems.""

That said the prices of ethanol produced in India are higher in comparison to global players since the cost of raw materials--that is sugarcane and food grains--are fixed by the government to support farmers. But at present excise duty on the landed cost of petrol at oil depots is higher than the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the landed cost of ethanol and the benefit is being passed on to the retail consumers.

Petrol cost Rs 105 in Delhi on May 1 and high petrol prices work in favour of EBP users. However should the price of ethanol increase beyond that of petrol consumers may have to pay more for ethanol-blended fuel. In such a scenario tax (GST) breaks on ethanol may become necessary said the NITI Aayog roadmap.

Jain of CEEW stresses that the gains from ethanol-blended petrol are miniscule as compared to the effort. ""Only if there is a substantial increase in fuel prices consumers gain from blending ethanol; otherwise the gains are not that big"" she said.

""In November when we checked the savings were as little as 5%-6%. For OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers or automobile manufacturers) investing in the internal combustion engine value chain makes no sense since it has to be phased out eventually (as EVs are introduced). Apart from Brazil nowhere else in the world are people looking at ethanol as an energy security solution"" said Jain. ""Overall when it comes to our E20 target there is net-net not so much impact (on energy security).""

But Hetal Gandhi director of CRISIL Research a global ratings agency believes that EBP can be a viable option for now as EVs will become a reality only after 2026-27.

""When oil prices were lower the scheme (EBP) was more expensive for a consumer who is buying EBP"" said Gandhi. ""Right now oil prices are high so it is a great value proposition for consumers in terms of the amount that gets passed on to them. There is time for the EV ecosystem to get established. Until then you proliferate CNG and you also shift demand to blended petrol.""

E20 target could impact food water security

The NITI Aayog has estimated an ethanol demand of 10.16 billion litres by 2025 based on the expected growth of vehicles. The current ethanol production capacity in India of 4.26 billion litres derived from molasses-based distilleries and 2.58 billion litres from grain-based distilleries is proposed to be expanded to 7.6 billion litres and 7.4 billion litres respectively. This will require 6 million metric tonne (MT) of sugar and 16.5 million MT of grains per annum by ESY 2025.

The IEEFA report translates this as 30000 additional sq km of land to come under maize cultivation. With half that land IEEFA estimates India can generate clean electricity by 2050.

Using one hectare of land for solar power generation is far more efficient than using the same land for cultivation of any of the agricultural ethanol feedstocks. For example an EV charged from solar energy generated on one hectare of land can drive 32 times further than an EV running on ethanol derived from one hectare of sugarcane. The difference is even higher for other feedstocks.

Use of land on this scale to grow crops for ethanol production is questionable considering India's food security concerns the fact that sugarcane is a water-guzzling crop and that availability of damaged or surplus grains is uncertain. For example on average one tonne of sugarcane can produce 100 kg of sugar and 70 litres of ethanol. Cultivation of each kg of sugar requires 1600 to 2000 litres of water. Hence one litre of ethanol from sugar requires about 2860 litres of water.

Ethanol can be produced from both maize and sugarcane.

""If we do increase the area under sugarcane cultivation we are using land that can be used for food crops. Increasing land under food grains like maize for ethanol also makes no sense from a food security point of view and maize also produces less ethanol as compared to sugarcane"" said Ramya Natarajan a research scientist at Bengaluru-based think-tank Centre for Study of Science Technology and Policy (CSTEP). ""Besides what needs to be kept in mind is that right now there might be a surplus (of grains or sugarcane) but there are so many factors like climate change that impact yield.""

If the target is for E10 rather than E20 Natarajan believes it would be possible to achieve with existing availability of molasses and sugarcane juice without need for extra land or water.

Even the NITI Aayog roadmap asks that ethanol production reduce dependency on water-intensive first generation biofuels like sugarcane and instead develop advanced biofuels.

""The task force on sugarcane and sugar industry estimated that sugarcane and paddy combined are using 70% of the country's irrigation water depleting water availability for other crops"" as per the roadmap . ""Hence there is a need for a change in crop patterns to reduce dependence on one particular crop and to move to more environmentally sustainable crops for ethanol production. Cereals particularly maize and second generation (2G) biofuels with suitable technological innovations offer promise of a more environmentally benign alternative feedstock for production of ethanol.""

The National Policy on Biofuels had emphasised on 2G biofuels in 2018 too but the E20 target put the focus back on first generation feedstock options. 2G biofuels include rice or wheat straw corn cobs bagasse bamboo and other non-food feedstock. At the moment 2G biofuels technology is at a nascent stage due to which the roadmap has called for technological innovations.

Limited reduction in earth-warming emissions

The roadmap estimated higher reductions in carbon monoxide emissions with E20 fuel--50% lower in two-wheelers and 30% lower in four-wheelers--as compared to unblended petrol. Hydrocarbon emissions also reduced by 20% with ethanol blends compared to normal gasoline. But how does that fare in terms of absolute reduction in greenhouse gas emissions?

(SMC) said the reopening of the economy pushed up first quarter operating income by 25 percent to P40.1 billion while its fuel subsidiary Petron Corp. doubled earnings as oil prices rushed higher in the wake of Russia’s Ukraine invasion.

Led by billionaire and company president Ramon Ang SMC ended the January to March period with consolidated revenues of P316.8 billion up 57 percent.

It attributed gains to strong volume growth and increased selling prices despite the Omicron pandemic surge early in the year and volatile commodity costs.

“Overall we are off to a good start this year with volumes and revenues showing robust growth” Ang said in a statement.

“Economic activity is returning to prepandemic levels our workforce has been fully vaccinated and we have managed to keep the virus under control. With these we are confident we can sustain our target levels of growth” he added.

Recurring net income

SMC said recurring net income which removes one-off items rose 3 percent to P13.9 billion during the quarter.

Its earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization—a key measure of profitability—was also up 9 percent to P44.8 billion the statement showed.

Petron was among its best performing subsidiaries after the company doubled first quarter profits to P3.6 billion because of higher demand and skyrocketing fuel prices after Russia invaded Ukraine. Petron revenues also jumped 107 percent to P172.3 billion during the same period.

San Miguel Food and Beverage Inc. which owns its beer spirts and food businesses recorded a first quarter net income of P9.2 billion up 1 percent. Total revenues rose 9 percent to P83.1 billion.

“This was driven mainly by a combination of volume growth and better selling prices across multiple categories in its beer spirits and food divisions” SMC said.

Power sales

SMC Global Power Holdings Corp. saw revenues reach P43 billion during the first quarter up 57 percent.

This gains were due to higher electricity sales as demand for power increased. SMC Global Power is one of the country’s largest energy producers with about 4714 megawatts of combined capacity by the end of 2021.

Its power assets include the 1000-MW Sual coal plant in Pangasinan the 1200-MW Ilijan natural gas power plant in Batangas and 345-MW San Roque hydroelectric facility In San Manuel Pangasinan.

SMC’s infrastructure arm recorded a 44 percent increase in revenues to P6.2 billion during the first quarter of the year.

The state government has decided to conclude the procurement of wheat in 825 mandis across the state from Sunday evening. There are a total of 1099 grain markets in Punjab out of which 274 have already closed.

Punjab's foodcivil supplies and consumer affairs minister Lal Chand Kataruchak said the details of the wheat procurement season were issued by the mandi board. According to him the state government has ensured the speedy disbursal of Minimum Support Price (MSP) dues directly into the bank accounts of the farmers.

Agriculture expert Devinder Sharma has cited the prolonged dry spell as the primary reason for the decline in wheat procurements. Drought resulted in shrivelled grains and subsequently decreased the yield.

The Punjab government is yet to announce compensation to the affected wheat farmers.

Sometimes Mother Nature and modern technology just don't mix -- especially when it comes to the nation's power grids.

Gusty winds knock down power lines and spark wildfires. Vegetation surrounding the substations catch fire. Severe winter storms cause mayhem at substations bringing freezing conditions to regions with infrastructure not built to withstand frigid temperatures. And these threats are expected to worsen as the number of severe weather events continue to climb due to climate change.

But the risks posed by nature don't end with natural disasters. Wildlife also poses a significant threat to power grids experts told ABC News.

""Animals also play a role in the reliability of the overall power system"" Drew McGuire the director of substations distribution and environment research at the Electric Power Research Institute a non-profit energy research and development organization told ABC News. ""We typically see this in distribution in the lower voltages that you would typically see in neighborhoods and things like that in in substations.""

One of the biggest ways animals disrupt the flow of electricity to households is by breaking into electrical substations Luis Puigcerver a senior product manager for wildlife and asset protection at TE Connectivity a technology company that designs and manufactures connectors and sensors told ABC News.

Once critters such as squirrels rats raccoons and even snakes get into the substation all they have to do is touch two pieces of bare metal to conduct a surge Puigcerver said. Just the slightest touch could cause a flashover which is involves electricity running through the animal from one electrical bare connection to another or to a grounded position he added.

""They're sitting on a piece of metal that that's either grounded or electrified and then they touch their pop of their nose"" Puigcerver said. ""And sometimes they don't even have to touch and get very close to it and it'll bridge the gap -- literally cause that electricity to jump from the metal through the body of the creature and then short itself out.""

What results is a small explosion that leaves the animal burned electrocuted and causes damage to the substation and outages to sometimes thousands of households Puigcerver said. Sometimes the animal can even catch fire he said.

""It could be catastrophic"" he said. ""In some areas I've seen a small little 12-inch squirrel blow up a $2 million-plus transformer.""'

Birds especially birds of prey with large wingspans pose the second more significant threat to power grids Alex Mackewich Power Line Sentry a company that designs power protection solutions to prevent power outages and wildlife deaths told ABC News.

Power poles in the U.S. typically are made with wooden poles and three wires as conductors. While it's a common sight to see flocks of smaller birds sitting safely on one wire the danger is present when the birds are able to touch two different charges as once.

Squirrels and sometimes snakes can also climb onto the wires and cause this damage but in North America birds are typically the culprits Puigcerver said. Bald eagles especially love to perch on top of the poles to hunt for prey but when it takes off with its 6-foot wingspan and touches multiple bare wires that electric surge will then flow right through it he said.

Then if it falls to the ground onto dry vegetation it could spark a wildfire Mackewich said.

Animals have proven problematic in the past.

In March a bird that flew into an electrical substation was blamed for taking out power for nearly 10000 customers in New Orleans.

A slug was blamed for cutting power for nearly 10000 riders of two dozen high-speed trains in Japan in 2019. A weasel was the cause of a similar shutdown of Europe's Large Hadron Collider in 2016.

Squirrels which have been such a problem in the past that the American Public Power Association tracks squirrel-caused blackouts with its Squirrel Index are thought to be more dangerous to power grids than Russian hackers. In 1987 a stray squirrel was blamed for shutting down the NASDAQ for 82 minutes thwarting the trade of an estimated 20 million shares.

The data about the number of outages in the past caused by wildlife is likely underrepresented as technology advances and tracking methods improve Mackewich said.

Sometimes turning the power back on is as simple as resetting some of the lines so the power can be redirected. Other times customers can be without power for hours or even days as crews work to repair the damage Puigcerver said.

Officials will need to ensure the infrastructure is sound as the world begins to rely less on fossil fuels and more on electricity Mackewich said. Most of the structures in the U.S. are at least 50 years old and there are many that are more than 100 years old she said. Power grids are not only subject to a demand they likely were not built for but climate change continues to threaten the grids.

The ultimate ""failsafe"" is to create underground lines that are protected from the elements Puigcerver said. But burying the power lines underground is expensive and requires extensive planning around the topography of the land.

Utility companies spend a lot of time thinking about how to mitigate potential impacts and how to do so in a cost-effective way McGuire said.

Three types of technology are used to prevent outages he said. Insulation products covers that companies would use to cover power lines and transformer metal connectors act to prevent an animal such as a squirrel or a bird from making contact with an energized component. Isolation products something like a fence or spikes are installed to prevent birds from perching and discs are used in similar ways at substations. And hazing products products that are meant to discourage animals from from entering the general area include flight diverters or a plastic owl and in some cases noise machines McGuire said.

TE Connectivity has created plastic materials designed to withstand the rigors of pollution ultraviolet rays and electrical activity some which cover critical areas such as bare wires and transformer metal connectors to prevent accidents on power lines and substations Puigcerver said.

""And that's why these devices that you put up from a maintenance standpoint and from a reliability standpoint come into play afterwards"" he said.",,,,,,,,,

There are already signs of investor concern. As Tesla has become one of the world’s most valuable companies its stock has become widely owned by retail investors through mutual funds and other investment vehicles. But it has fallen 24 percent since the disclosure early last month that Mr. Musk had taken a sizable stake in Twitter a period in which the S&P 500 has declined 10 percent.

The Supercharger station features four plugs for Tesla vehicles and supplements an already-existing Destination Charger which charges electric vehicles at a much slower rate.

Henry Krull owns the station with his wife Mary Krull and said the Supercharger station has been open and available to Tesla owners since the middle of last November but the official opening ceremony was delayed almost six months due to the tragic death of a close friend who was integral to the development of the site.

Derek Leichliter was contracted to work on the project but was killed last fall in a plane crash on Kodiak just weeks before the Superchargers were scheduled to go online. Leichliter was an electrical contractor who was the proprietor of Legacy Electric on the Kenai Peninsula.

“This project was a big deal for him” Krull said. “He was very passionate about renewable energy and electric vehicles and he was very excited to be working on this project and was trying to get awarded the contracts for additional Alaska Tesla Superchargers and I believe they may have been awarded to him posthumously.”

The official opening ceremony included the unveiling of a large rock emblazoned with a plaque that reads “This first-in-Alaska Tesla Supercharger station is dedicated to our dear friend and outdoor lover Derek Leichliter of Legacy Electric whose passion and support for electric vehicles will forever be part of his legacy.”

Krull owns the land the Superchargers sit on colloquially known as Whistle Hill. The area features the Addie Camp restaurant Fresh365 hydroponic farm and Brew@602 which occupies the interior of a nearly 70-year-old Alaska Railroad train car that was retired in 2002.

But it’s the development of a long-term solution to powering electric cars on Alaska’s road that has Krull excited.

“I think it’s particularly important in our state which was built on oil and gas” Krull said. “And despite that there is a transition going on here in Alaska just like in the Lower 48 to renewable energy sources and cutting down greenhouse gas emissions and there really is a trend towards electric cars now.”

The Whistle Hill development sits on the hill leading into Soldotna proper on the Sterling Highway and the Tesla Supercharger station is just the next chapter in revitalizing and bringing a modern touch to the area.

There are over 30000 Supercharger stations around the world according to Tesla’s website. Krull said he was told that there are over 800 Tesla’s in the state a far cry from just six years ago — Krull said when he first purchased his car in 2016 it was just the fifth Tesla to be owned in Alaska.

Krull had previously installed three Destination Chargers a year after buying his own Tesla which the company itself offered to send him.

“As the Tesla population began to grow there was a talk among Tesla owners through Facebook forums primarily about getting Tesla to put in Supercharger locations” Krull said. “And again that would just open up the state for fast charging and you know driving from you know Soldotna or Homer or all the way up to Fairbanks potentially.”

Krull said once the company felt like there were enough Tesla owners in the state the feasibility of installing the first Supercharger station became a reality.

“Of course I couldn’t contain myself and I said ‘Hey let me know I’ll do whatever you need’” Krull said.

Tesla asked the Krulls for space on their property to work on the installation then got to work putting in the infrastructure.

“My wife and I the developers of Whistle Hill really thought that that would be a big draw to our development in getting Tesla owners to come and charge at our location and maybe visit our business facilities up there” Krull said. “And likewise Tesla thought it was a very good fit because that’s the kind of place they like to put superchargers is places where Tesla owners can get out stretch legs get something to eat something to drink.”

The addition of Supercharger station is a gamechanger for Alaska — Destination Chargers are able to give a Tesla approximately 30 miles for each hour of charging while Superchargers extend that range to a whopping 250 miles for an hour of charge Krull said.

Tesla claims that one hour of charging can give a car 800 miles in ideal conditions. That mileage varies depending on weather conditions; in cold temperatures batteries don’t hold a charge as well and therefore won’t last as long just as a standard car battery in a gasoline-powered vehicle will lose charge sooner in cold weather.

Krull said the superchargers will provide a big boost to the renewable energy industry on the Kenai Peninsula. According to Tesla the average driver can save over $2000 a year (using current gas prices in Alaska).

“I think it’s going to be critically important for us to make the transition” Krull said. “Alaska being the size that it is needs to have significant infrastructure because ideally these fast chargers are available every 100 to 150 miles. That’s what really makes driving across the state possible.”

The electricity providing the Superchargers on Whistle Hill currently comes from the Homer Electric Association grid Krull said powered by natural gas and wind turbines but he hopes to soon switch over to solar power. Construction for those solar panels is expected to begin in a month he said and could be ready to turn on by this fall.

Krull also said he’s planning to develop a large-scale solar farm in Sterling that he hopes one day can provide power to about 5000 homes in the area. Krull expects that project to be completed in three or four years.

DragTimes' host Brooks Weisblat owned both cars and he raced them on multiple occasions.

Fast forward to the present Brooks still owns the McLaren 720S and he's now also the proud owner of a Model S Plaid. In the recent video above DragTimes heads to the Palm Beach International Raceway to run one final test and tune before the track closes. Brooks says the track owners are trying to sell it though it was unable to be rezoned. For now the track will be closed until an upcoming hearing in September.

At any rate the races of the day included the tri-motor all-wheel-drive Model S Plaid – which Tesla says can pull off a zero-to-60-mph sprint in just 1.99 seconds – versus a Dodge Demon a Hayabusa bike and of course a McLaren 720S.

As you'll see the Plaid makes easy work of the Demon though it only beats the superbike in one of three drag races. To makes things a bit interesting the McLaren 720S which doesn't appear to be Weisblat's car gets an intentional headstart when it faces off against the range-topping Model S. However it's not a big enough headstart because the McLaren has clearly met its match.

Unlike its predecessor – the Model S P100DL – the Plaid makes easy work of the 720S despite the headstart. In fact the McLaren almost looks as though it's not moving very quickly as the Model S easily overtakes the initial lead.

In the end the race between the Plaid and 720S isn't even close. The Model S pulls off a 9.42-second quarter-mile with a trap speed of 146.86 mph. Meanwhile the McLaren supercar finished the sprint in 10.17 seconds with a 139.50 mph trap speed.

Tesla has sued a former employee who it is accusing of stealing trade secrets related to its supercomputer project Bloomberg reported on Friday. According to a filing in the U.S. District Court in San Jose thermal engineer Alexander Yatskov quit on May 2 after having joined the company only a few months earlier in January. According to Tesla Yatskov admitted to transferring confidential information to his personal devices and later handing over a ""dummy"" laptop after company officials confronted him on suspicion of theft.

In addition to breaching a non-disclosure agreement intended to protect trade secrets Bloomberg reports that Tesla is also accusing Yatskov of misrepresenting his experience and skills on his resume. Bloomberg also says that Yatskov declined to comment.

“This is a case about illicit retention of trade secrets by an employee who in his short time at Tesla already demonstrated a track record of lying and then lying again by providing a ‘dummy’ device to try and cover his tracks” Tesla wrote in the filing reports Bloomberg.

CEO Elon Musk has been teasing Tesla's supercomputer project called ""Dojo"" since at least 2019. Last summer the company finally explained the project in more detail laying out a goal of using AI to analyze massive amounts of vehicle data ideally resulting in a safer more refined autonomous driving experience. The computer which offers 1.8 exaflops of performance and 10 petabytes of NVME storage running at 1.6 terabytes per second trains itself using video from eight cameras inside Tesla vehicles running at 36 frames per second.

Tesla claimed last year that although this approach generates a tremendous amount of data it is still more scalable than building high-definition maps around the world. At the time Tesla indicated that the system was most successful in sparsely populated areas where cars could mostly drive uninterrupted. Even so the company also touted some early successes in denser areas including Dojo's ability to learn new types of traffic warnings pedestrian collision detection and pedal misapplications (accidentally hitting the gas instead of the brakes)."

In Hulu's latest dramatized true-crime series Candy we're invited into a small town in Texas in 1980. However don't be fooled by the title because the story is anything but sweet. It has all the fixins of a classic crime tale complete with an unsatisfied housewife an illicit affair and a bloody ax.

The woman behind the murder is Candy Montgomery and all she wanted out of life was a little excitement which she found in Allan Gore a married husband with two kids. Of course Candy had everything she should have wanted: a beautiful home two adorable children and a husband who gave her almost everything. When Candy murdered Allan's wife her family was turned inside out. What became of her husband Pat Montgomery? Here's what we know.

Where is Pat Montgomery now?

According to Texas Monthly Pat and Candy got married in the early 1970s. At the time Pat was ""one of the brightest young electrical engineers at Texas Instruments."" Candy was working as a secretary and by all accounts was an attractive woman with a high-pitched laugh that you couldn't possibly ignore. With an easy charm and a fun personality it's easy to see why Pat would want to scoop her up.

Pat and Candy soon had a son and a daughter and in 1977 the family moved to Wylie Tex. As an ""army brat"" who was constantly on the move growing up getting married and settling down in the country was exactly what Candy thought she wanted. Pat had an amazing job working on ""sophisticated military radar systems at Texas Instruments"" where he made $70000 a year (about $332000 in 2022). Given the era and her husband's salary Candy stayed home with the children and immersed herself in their church though she quickly became ""bored crazy.""

Church is where the Montgomerys met Allan and Betty Gore. Beyond that Candy and Allan played on a volleyball league together which is how bored Candy got the idea to ask Allan if he wanted to engage in a strictly physical affair. After much consideration Allan relented and the two began a 6-month relationship that Candy would eventually break off after Allan recommitted himself to Betty and their marriage.

Candy's husband Pat was mysterious or at the very least he was a shadowy figure in the background of this tragic quasi lust triangle. The most ""damning"" thing about him was the fact that he didn't understand what Candy wrote in her creative writing class. We always come back to what we know and what Candy knew was a childhood of instability that consisted of constantly moving and possibly not forming a lot of deep attachments. When she finally got what she thought she wanted with Pat maybe it just didn't feel like home.

Then in 1980 Candy murdered Betty Gore with an ax leaving 41 wounds in her body. Initially she told no one but eventually claimed self-defense during her trial which in a wild plot twist actually worked. Candy was acquitted. Evidently Pat stayed by her side throughout the entire ordeal but it was reported by The Daily Mail that after moving to Georgia Pat and Candy divorced. Apparently Candy returned to her maiden name of Wheeler and Pat seemingly disappeared. Now this story will be told by Hulu and we want to know who will be playing Pat.

Who plays Pat Montgomery in Hulu's 'Candy'?

Physically the casting is a bit off but emotionally we're pretty sure this actor is nailing it. Pat Montgomery is being portrayed by actor Timothy Simons who's best known as Jonah Ryan from Veep. While Jonah is dorky often sleazy but adorably lonely the character of Pat comes across as a devoted father and husband who at times is more like a third child to Candy (played by Jessica Biel).

When we first meet him he's enthusiastically discussing plans to take the kids to see The Empire Strikes Back. And while the faux confidence of Jonah Ryan is missing here what we get is the comfortable confidence of a man who's deeply satisfied with his life. Nothing drives that point home harder than when Candy tells Pat he should get more friends and he says ""I'm not 11 years old. I have you."" And that's when we start to see the cracks in Candy's life as she realizes she's the sun in the orbit of her family's universe which cannot last.

Speaking exclusively with Distractify Timothy Simons opened up about tackling this simple somewhat oblivious character. ""I would joke around [on set] about how my job is pretty easy in the first couple episodes in that I just had to play a guy who was uncomplicated and stoked about how things were going"" he said.

Of course things don't stay uncomplicated for long which means Timothy's job as an actor got a bit more layered and difficult. ""There was one big question in my mind about [Pat]"" Timothy revealed. ""How does one compartmentalize this new information about your spouse somebody who you have in front of God and family said that you'll spend the rest of your life with for better or worse? How does somebody who thinks their entire life is set and solved compartmentalize pretty unbelievable new information?""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy91cy1jaGVlcmxlYWRlci1kaWVzLWFnZWQtMTktMTAyNzU5MzYxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US cheerleader dies aged 19 after alarming online post about struggles with injury,"A 19-year-old cheerleader at the Southern University and A&M College in Louisiana who took to social media to share her struggles with mental health died this week.

Arlana Miller a first-year student from Texas was announced dead by university authorities on Thursday raising concern about the mounting pressure on student athletes in the United States.

""Our entire campus community is deeply saddened by the untimely death of Arlana Miller a freshman who was majoring in agriculture on the Baton Rouge campus” the university said in a statement on Facebook.

The university did not share the cause of her death but the athletic department confirmed she died after putting up a post on social media.

It added that on 4 May at approximately 9pm local time the athletic department was informed about a social media post ""which ultimately led to this unfortunate announcement"".

In her final post on Instagram Millar wrote about her mental health struggles and history of suicidal thoughts. She wrote about her sufferings in this past year alone with Covid-19 tearing her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and failing school.

The post has since been deleted from the platform however screenshots of her message continue to make rounds.

HOUSTON Texas (KTRK) -- Surgeries at the Micheal E. DeBakey VA Medical Center were shut down after reports of bacterial water contamination of surgical instruments on Wednesday.

The video above is ABC13's 24/7 livestream.

According to the VA there is a routine of testing the deionized water used to wash and disinfect instruments for surgical procedures. The samples are sent for out-of-state testing.

One of the test results came back with a bacteria level that was higher than average and one sample came back out of the normal range. Other samples were satisfactory.

A new sample has been sent for retesting and is expected to return.

In a statement from the Houston VA Communications Director they suspect that the water sample from the surgical instrument cleaning table was contaminated due to a mailing issue.

As a precaution surgeries were postponed until further notice.

The VA says they are doing all they can to confirm the safety of the deionized water and will be taking action on the water safety results as necessary. Their process of cleaning and sterilizing is stringent and involves instruments being cleaned in a high-heat sterilizer.

As of Friday the VA is operational and surgical procedures will continue with disposable instruments.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9wb3AtY3VsdHVyZS93aGF0LWhhcHBlbmVkLWJldHR5LWdvcmUtZ3J1ZXNvbWUtYXhlLW11cmRlci1yZXZpc2l0ZWQtYWhlYWQtaHVsdS1zLWNhbmR5LXByZW1pZXJl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What happened to Betty Gore?

Ever-growing needs for Actionable Insights

Thermo Fisher has grown through acquisitions and has a complex ecosystem. Thermo Fisher has a data-driven culture and a business drive to ingest new data and derive actionable business insights. Thermo Fisher’s Enterprise Technology Organization (ETO) has built a data lake namely Enterprise Data Platform (EDP) that supports different business group’s Analytics/DW/BI needs. The ETO team has used Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) as the data lake solution because of its high availability scalability 11 9s of durability and cost efficiency. Business users on the other hand are familiar with Microsoft Office 365 tools and use Excel SharePoint and Power Apps for their day-to-day requirements. When they need data lake resources they prefer to raise the request within the Microsoft platform itself.

In this blog post we explain how the ETO Team integrated Microsoft Power Apps with data lake resources provisioned on Amazon S3. We will also walk through the workflow devised to automate and enable the self-service platform for business users familiar with the Microsoft platform.

The ETO team works closely with business stakeholders to support their ever-growing needs. As of early 2022 the ETO team serves eight business groups and 14 corporate functions (HR Finance IT etc.). When the ETO team developed EDP their goal was to have business users self-serve to get their resources created with the least amount of lead time.

Creation and management of data lake S3 buckets was a manual multi-step process. Business users had to put in the request which went through an approval cycle. Each of the S3 buckets must follow certain standards including encryption lifecycle policy S3 storage class analysis configuration tagging and access control to be compliant with Thermo Fisher’s policies for ensuring data security. There are hundreds of TBs of data maintained in the EDP data lake. As of early 2022 the EDP has hundreds of buckets per environment (Dev QA Prod) and dozens of buckets being created per week. The ETO team has planned to automate the end-to-end process that would provide a seamless faster experience to business stakeholders.

Existing Manual Process

Thermo Fisher’s business users are familiar with Office 365 tools and Microsoft Power Apps. The business users used to put the S3 bucket provisioning requests in the Power Apps platform and notify the ETO admin team. The ETO admin team would then collect the requirements from the Power Apps platform update the AWS CloudFormation template manually with the bucket configuration and provision the bucket by running the updated CloudFormation template. AWS CloudFormation is an infrastructure as code service that gives developers and businesses an easy way to create a collection of related AWS and third-party resources and provision and manage them in an orderly and predictable fashion.

However the manual process of gathering business requirements and updating the CloudFormation templates takes time especially with the scale of the enterprise. Hence introducing an innovative approach to link the Microsoft ecosystem and AWS together in one workflow became important. When Microsoft introduced REST API capability in the Power Apps platform it helped the ETO team build the integration between Microsoft ecosystem and AWS.

Enabling self-service by integrating Microsoft Power Apps with AWS

The ETO team at Thermo Fisher designed the architecture (as shown in Figure 1) to remove the manual work required to update the CloudFormation templates. This serverless architecture is performant cost efficient and reduces the operational overhead.

Let us dive deep into how this architecture enables a self-service platform through the integrated workflow as illustrated in Figure 2:

The following numbers correspond to the steps shown in Figure 2:

Business user submits a S3 bucket creation request in the PowerApps interface. The app requires all mandatory tags and justification for security and compliance requirements. There are links to documentation on the app to guide the user. Power Automate forwards the request to the admin team for review and approval. Once approved the system processes the next step. Power Apps uses REST API Action to call Amazon API Gateway (API Gateway) a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create publish maintain monitor and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the “front door” for applications to access data business logic or functionality from backend services. Power Apps passes the S3 bucket configuration details to the API Gateway. The ETO team has used a combination of Lambda authorizers and IP restrictions to enforce security. API Gateway triggers an AWS Lambda function to create the S3 bucket. AWS Lambda is a serverless event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers. The REST API call carries all the S3 bucket configuration details. AWS Lambda creates the S3 bucket and uses an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) execution role that only allows the access to create buckets. IAM provides fine-grained access control across all of AWS. With IAM one can specify who can access which services and resources and under which conditions. The ETO team uses the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) package to create the buckets. If there are any errors AWS Lambda returns the error code which is passed to the Power Apps via an API Gateway response. Power Apps sends an email to the admin team via the Power Automate Outlook activity. AWS Lambda logs success or error messages in Amazon CloudWatch a monitoring and observability service that provides customers with data and actionable insights to monitor the applications. Upon success Power Automate sends an email to the user and the ETO admin team. The email is sent by an Office 365 Service Account.

Conclusion

With this automated self-service platform the ETO team reduced the data lake resource provisioning turnaround time from days to hours. Also the integration between Microsoft Power Apps with AWS services allowed the ETO team to decouple business user experience from the backend technology. This helped the ETO team choose the right technology and cloud provider for their data lake requirements without disrupting the experience of the business users who can continue with the tool sets that they are comfortable with.

This solution is the first step in building a bridge between the Microsoft Office ecosystem and AWS in the Thermo Fisher environment. Continuing to build on the power of the Amazon API Gateway as the bridge the ETO team plans to expand and scale up the solution to pair and match other AWS services and Microsoft Office Services. As a next step the team plans to address the following automation needs:

Request for AWS Management Console access or AWS IAM access key creation

Request to add service access or security policies to an existing IAM role

Request access to data lake so that users can query data using their preferred analytics platform

The ETO team believes that this will activate and inspire endless possibilities where resource auto-creation is merely a start. This will foster innovation drive more automation and process improvements within Thermo Fisher.

Developers will break ground on the Beckington Townhomes project on Wednesday May 11 with the first homes expected to be built out by the third quarter of this year. The entire development will be built out in three phases.

The project across from Clancy Drive near Old Fayetteville Road and Lanvale Road is in a growing area of Brunswick County where developers Burkentine Builders look to capture the incoming market.

As more people and businesses move into the county the builders are targeting professionals coming to the Wilmington area who may not be ready to buy a house.

According to Burkentine communication consultant Alec Sivel while the project is geared toward the luxury market the goal is to expand the overall rental options for workers in the Leland community.

""Especially in healthcare or manufacturing their jobs transfer them here but they just don't have any of these rental units for folks to move in"" Sivel said. ""And the last thing they want to do is buy a home especially with the market we're looking at.""

The two-story three-bedroom townhomes are priced at over $2000 per month. The community will offer walking/biking paths an outdoor fitness center a dog park and clubhouse.

Before the development was approved residents in the area raised concerns about the project's impacts on stormwater traffic and the building heights.

“We are experiencing strong growth and increased opportunity in our county"" North Brunswick Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Dana Fisher said in a release.

""Many people are relocating to Leland and the surrounding towns and luxury rental apartments are a much-needed amenity in this area.”

North Carolina State Highway Patrol said Trooper Cody Thao used his own patrol car as a barrier to stop the driver who was speeding up an exit ramp the wrong way. The dramatic crash was caught on dashcam video.

Police said Trooper Thao was called in to help with a pursuit in the early morning hours of April 8. Just as the trooper arrived the pursuit arrived onto the I-40 eastbound ramp to Rock Quarry Road in Wake County. The suspect started driving the wrong way on the ramp.

The video shows Trooper Thao intentionally drive his own car into the path of the suspected drunk driver to stop him from entering the interstate going the wrong way. Amazingly the trooper was not injured.

“I could not be prouder of Trp. Thao and his quick decision to stop the wrong way driver his actions most undoubtedly saved lives” Colonel Freddy L. Johnson Jr. commander of the North Carolina State Highway Patrol said in a statement. “His willingness to put himself in harm’s way is representative of the lifesaving work our members do each day. Placing others before ourselves is not just a saying amongst the law enforcement profession it’s a reality of what we do for the betterment of the communities we serve.”

Trooper Thao told Fox 12 he didn’t even think about how he could be seriously injured until afterward.

“Once I saw the vehicle I just decided to stop the chase right there” Thao said. “This is what we signed up to do this is what we agreed to do.”

He added “All the credit goes out to the other troopers who inspire me on a daily basis especially here in Wake County.”

Thao has been with the North Carolina State Highway Patrol for less than a year.

“Before that I actually worked at a Tractor Supply” he said. “I don’t have any prior experience with law enforcement. I’ve always had a servant’s heart and I’ve always wanted to help people.”

Greenworks goes with a 26-inch dual-action blade for the brushless motor to drive. The “dual-action” designation simply means that it is able to cut in both directions and is a must-have feature.

The branch capacity is up to an impressive 1.2 inches—a significant improvement from the previous model’s 3/4-inch capacity. Some residential models move up to 1 inch while others are at 3/4-inch putting Greenworks ahead of a lot of the competition.

The blades slice away at 3200 SPM a speed that matches some commercial-level cordless models.

When it comes to actually trimming hedges we don’t have any complaints about the cutting performance. The knives make quick work of well-maintained shrubs. When it comes to those that don’t get as much attention the blades keep their speed up well and the additional capacity makes a big difference.

There’s no doubt that you can feel the weight of this tool especially when you need to work at shoulder height. Without a battery we weighed the Greenworks HT60L211 at 7.2 pounds. However that’s almost 1/2 a pound less than the last version. With our 2.0 Ah battery it bulks up to 10.1 pounds.

The 2.0 Ah battery is the way to go on this model. It balances the weight much better drops the weight by more than 1.5 pounds compared to a 4.0Ah pack and still gives you up to 45 minutes of runtime.

Rotating Handle

I really enjoy having a rotating handle on my hedge trimmers. It’s a big help when you’re trimming sides or angles and helps take some of the strain off of your back. To rotate the handle drop your finger into the ring below the trigger and pull back. Then rotate the handle left or right into any of its 5 positions (180° of total rotation).

Simple Controls

You need safety measures on battery-powered lawn care equipment and the Greenworks 60V cordless hedge trimmer manages it without overcomplicating things. The trigger safety is on the front handle to ensure you have two hands on the tool. Just push it in with your natural grip pull the trigger and cut.

Battery Placement

There are only so many ways to install a battery on a hedge trimmer and we’re not a big fan of the side entry design on the last version. This update shifts to slide the pack down from the top and it’s much better.

Additional Highlights

Includes blade sheath

Greenworks 60V Battery-Powered Hedge Trimmer Price

As a bare tool the hedge trimmer runs $149.99 at Tractor Supply. The kit comes with a 2.0Ah battery and charger for $199.99—the same kit price as the previous model this one replaces. Either way you get a 4-year warranty.

The Bottom Line

The Greenworks 60V battery-powered hedge trimmer is simple to use and has the performance to tackle tougher hedge trimming than many of its competitors. Adding a couple of design tweaks to go with the improved power while leaving many of the best qualities from the previous model makes this one of the best cordless hedge trimmers currently available.

But Ms. Alvarez a legal-mediation firm owner is afraid of flying and she isn’t a billionaire — two facts that she was sure until just a few weeks ago would keep her fantasy as out of reach as the stars. She was wrong.

Ms. Alvarez 46 and her husband Rafael Landestoy recently booked a flight on a 10-person pressurized capsule that — attached to a massive helium-filled balloon — will gently float to 100000 feet while passengers sip champagne and recline in ergonomic chairs. The reservation required a $500 deposit; the flight itself will cost $50000 and last six to 12 hours.

“I feel like it was tailor-made for the chickens like me who don’t want to get on a rocket” said Ms. Alvarez whose flight organized by a company called World View is scheduled to depart from the Grand Canyon in 2024.

Less than a year after Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson kicked off a commercial space race by blasting into the upper atmosphere within weeks of each other last summer the global space tourism market is skyrocketing with dozens of companies now offering reservations for everything from zero-pressure balloon trips to astronaut boot camps and simulated zero-gravity flights. But don’t don your spacesuit just yet. While the financial services company UBS estimates the space travel market will be worth $3 billion by 2030 the Federal Aviation Administration has yet to approve most out-of-this-world trips and construction has not started on the first space hotel.

Short trips and staycations were how Chinese spent their Labor Day holiday this year amid COVID-19 control measures and ongoing domestic travel restrictions. Of these “glamping” (glamorous camping) came out on top. According to travel booking site Qunar ticket sales for parks that allow campsites increased by over 50 percent compared with the same period last year. Ctrip data also shows that on the first day of the holiday its online traffic for ""camping"" reached a historic peak and the search volume increased by 90 percent from the week before.

The Jing Take

Glamping has become one of the hippest trends among young Chinese travelers since COVID-19 hit the country in 2020. Distinct from its perception as a niche experience favored by outdoor enthusiasts the high-end outdoor activity has now hooked a broader consumer demographic. Aside from the experience of nature (and the draw this represents for those in urban centers) its connotations of glamor and luxury translate well to social media: on Xiaohongshu there are over three million campaign-related UGC posts from snapshots of gear to the adventure itself.

This booming trend has projected a promising future for the outdoor equipment and apparel market. As Daxue Consulting forecasted the sector is expected to reach 100 billion (666.8 billion RMB) by 2025.

Luxury houses have been quick to tap this opportunity. Last year Prada unveiled its Outdoor Collection a special ready-to-wear range inspired by the great outdoors. And local players like the lifestyle brand Beast launched Spring 2022’s “Inspired by Camping” with gear like mats night lights and portable cookware as well as fragrance gift boxes.

Glamping shows no sign of going anywhere. The challenge for luxury companies is not whether to engage — that’s a given — but what to offer. As the market saturates with more of the same traditional gear there is money to be made for a label that can think creatively.

Things are getting better but it could still be dicey,"""Sean did you book the rental car yet?""

It's a question my wife knows to ask me since I have historically had a habit of booking almost every aspect of our trip far in advance — flights hotels entertainment — but leaving the rental car until the last minute.

I'm apparently not alone and industry experts tell TPG breaking that habit is among the best things you can do right now. That's because rental car companies are preparing for a summer onslaught of travelers even as they still try to climb out of a car shortage that's plagued the industry since travel began bouncing back from the worst days of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Here are some of the issues travelers may still face if they need to rent a car this summer.

Car shortage

TPG has reported on the rental car shortage for many months now. Rental car companies sold off cars when demand dipped by as much as 80% in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As travel has returned though the companies have not been able to replace cars at a fast enough rate because of problems with the global supply chain. Shortages of key parts like microchips have slowed new car production across the board and the rental industry has been particularly affected.

A spokesperson for Enterprise Holdings which includes rental car brands Enterprise Alamo and National told TPG the global chip shortage continues to be a ""key challenge"" when it comes to new car availability but the company remains ""optimistic.""

There's still concern among industry leaders though.

""It's a challenging time and a tough time out there"" Greg Scott spokesperson for the American Car Rental Association told TPG Monday.

Scott recalled a recent situation where he was not able to find a rental car at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).

""We're trying just about everything we can do to increase these numbers"" he said. While there has been moderate improvement Scott said ""There is just not as many cars in the rental pool as we would like"" given a resurgence in both leisure and now business travel.

Reserving a car only to find none available when you arrive

Is it possible with the shortage you could reserve a car online only to get to the rental car facility to find no cars available?

Scott said that's the ""last thing"" the car companies want — and it's not entirely out of the question given the current situation. That's because when companies have fewer cars there's less flexibility at a single location if a few customers return vehicles late or a couple of vehicles have to go out of service because of mechanical issues.

""The cushion that was there in 2019 is no longer there"" he said.

Preparing for your travel

Both Scott and the rental car company representatives that TPG spoke with encouraged travelers to book a rental car as early as possible.

Enterprise called this ""critical"" and Hertz said customers should book their car right as they book their other travel arrangements.

A Hertz spokesperson also recommended customers check neighborhood car rental locations ""which may have more availability when airport volumes are high."" The company has thousands of non-airport locations nationwide.

Speaking from experience I've found neighborhood rental car facilities to be low-stress with short waits — and they are often located very close to your home or hotel.

Scott pointed out that reserving your car early doesn't just lock in your reservation. It also gives the rental companies an early heads up on where demand is going to be high so they can move cars to the area. That means more of a cushion if cars break down.

A Hertz representative told TPG it's consistently moving vehicles to areas with the highest demand which Scott said was a best practice across the industry.

""We're asking our customers to help us … by trying to get out in front of their reservation as early as possible and give us a signal where we have to get these cars"" he said. ""And we'll try to get them there.""

It's also a good idea to join the loyalty program for the car rental company you're using and look at the options the companies have (often free of charge) that allow you to manage your reservation from your phone or even skip the line and counter when you go to pick up your car.

Bottom line

While rental car companies work to improve the inventory problems that have plagued the industry during the pandemic Scott said it's clear this will continue to be an issue through 2022 and particularly over the summer given the supply chain problems.

To give yourself the best chance at avoiding unpleasant surprises when you try to reserve or pick up a car book it early. Also tap into whatever free loyalty benefits the car companies are offering and keep neighborhood locations in mind if something goes wrong and you need to look elsewhere for a car."

Utility man Mike Brosseau was recalled from Class AAA Nashville to take McCutchen's spot on the 26-man roster.

McCutchen went 1 for 5 with a run scored in the Brewers' 6-3 victory Friday night at Truist Park then reported symptoms earlier Saturday.

""He came in got tested here and just went back to the hotel"" manager Craig Counsell said. ""He's just going to stay at the hotel and as he feels better we'll figure out what to do.""

McCutchen entered Saturday tied for the team lead in hits with 24 in 25 games serving as Milwaukee's primary designated hitter. He's hitting .240 with two home runs and 14 runs batted in with an OPS of .641.

Brosseau meanwhile had been optioned out Sunday with teams needing to pare their roster sizes from 28 players down to 26.

He hit .250 with a homer and four RBI in 15 games for the Brewers.

McCutchen becomes the second Brewers player to land on the COVID-19 list this season joining catcher Victor Caratini.

Possible bad news for Jake Cousins

Right-hander Jake Cousins on the IL since Sunday with what was diagnosed as an elbow effusion is undergoing further examination after an MRI revealed the possibility of more serious damage.

""There's concern about the UCL with Jake Cousins"" Counsell said. ""We're getting a second opinion right now and we should have more information on that early next week.""

Cousins made his first opening-day roster with the Brewers after a strong debut in 2021. In eight appearances this season he's 2-1 with a 4.50 earned run average WHIP of 1.63 and 13 strikeouts in eight innings.

Milwaukee bolstered its bullpen in advance of its nine-game road trip Friday by selecting right-hander Luis Perdomo from Nashville.

The Brewers' bullpen entered Saturday ranked fifth in the major leagues second in the National League with a collective 2.89 ERA and tied for first with 13 saves (closer Josh Hader had 11 in 11 appearances tying him for second in the majors and tying him for first in the NL).

Brewers Manny Piña meet back up

Former Milwaukee shortstop Orlando Arcia won a World Series ring with Atlanta after being traded by the Brewers to the Braves last April.

The latest ex-Brewer seeking some jewelry with the Braves is Manny Piña who is currently on the IL with a wrist injury suffered in spring training.

Piña who turns 35 on June 5 became a favorite of Brewers fans since debuting with the team back in 2016 and had become something of an institution as backup catcher before Atlanta swooped in and signed him to a two-year $8 million contract last Nov. 15.

""Their offer was OK"" Piña said referring to the Brewers. ""This team offered more and my agent wanted security. I love the Brewers for sure and I wanted to finish my career there with them.

""But that's how it is. I'm here working playing the same baseball with the same attitude and trying to win games.""

Piña is hitting .143 with two RBI in five games with the Braves but it appears as though he'll be out for a bit longer as he said he's scheduled to undergo another MRI on his wrist.

The Brewers have had quite the time trying to replace Piña.

First free-agent signee Pedro Severino was suspended 80 games for a positive PED test at the end of spring training. The Brewers traded for Caratini and another potential backup Alex Jackson the next day.

Then Caratini landed on the COVID-19 IL leaving the Brewers to call up Jackson from Nashville before Caratini was reinstated.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9kYy1tZC12YS8yMDIyLzA1LzA3L2RjLWhvbWVsZXNzLWRlYXRoLW1pZ3VlbC1nb256YWxlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Miguel Gonzales died homeless in D.C. steps from his childhood home - The Washington Post,"Miguel Gonzales spent his life in Adams Morgan.

Matt Olson hit a two-run double during a four-run second inning. Duvall homered in the third off starter Aaron Ashby and Contreras added a three-run drive in the fifth off Jandel Gustave to pad the lead.

The Braves were winless over Morton’s last four starts a stretch that included a 7.85 ERA. But the 38-year-old right-hander (2-3) pitched around three walks to allow two hits with five strikeouts in five scoreless innings.

The defending World Series champions won just their second series of the season in nine tries to improve to 14-16. The Brewers have lost two straight but still lead the NL Central with a 19-10 record.

Duvall hit his second homer of the year with an opposite-field solo shot in the third to make it 5-0. Of Atlanta’s 34 homers this year 27 have been solo shots. Contreras made it 9-0 by connecting to left field with a 436-foot shot that left his bat at 113 mph.

The Braves went up 6-0 in the fourth when Dansby Swanson scored on a wild pitch off Ashby (0-3). Ashby was charged with six hits and six runs with four walks and three strikeouts in four innings.

Morton escaped trouble with the bases loaded in the second when Lorenzo Cain struck out and Jace Peterson flied out.

The Braves took a 4-0 lead in the second on Contreras’ bases-loaded walk Ronald Acuña Jr.’s RBI grounder and Olson’s double. Olson’s bloop hit landed in shallow left field just out of the reach of shortstop Willy Adames and allowed Acuña to score from first.

Milwaukee scored twice in the eighth off Tyler Matzek. Pinch-hitter Mike Brosseau had a run-scoring single and another run scored on a double-play grounder.

Streaking

Acuña reached on an infield single in the first increasing his on-base streak to an NL-best 23 games dating to June 25. Acuña doubled in the fifth and finished 2 for 4 with a stolen base.

Improving

Swanson got off to a rough start to the season but after going 2 for 3 he has hit .340 with six extra-base hits and eight RBIs in his last 16 games. He’s now batting .242.

Brewers catcher Omar Narváez dropped to the ground after a foul ball by Swanson glanced off his left arm in the fourth. He stayed in the game after being tended to by a trainer.

Be ready when called upon – this concept is ingrained in every Marine. Force readiness sets the Marine Corps apart from all other forces throughout the world. For III Marine Expeditionary Force adaptability and modernization have been crucial as the Marine Corps maintains this reputation and evolves into a stronger and more lethal fighting force.



“In order to carry out an attack we must have means available” wrote Sun Tsu in his timeless book The Art of War. “The material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness.”



III MEF has been using new training and upgraded technologies to support the successful completion of current and future missions throughout the Indo-Pacific region.



For the Marine Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Squadron (VMU) 3 1st Marine Air Wing the divestment of the RQ-21 Blackjack and transition to the MQ-9A Reaper are among these upgrades. The use of these Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) allows for communication and information relay by flying sensors across the battlespace.



The Mobile User Objective System is another new technology that affects the Marine Corps’ long-range communication capabilities. MUOS works as a satellite communication system providing safe and secure worldwide network coverage so that Marines can target enemy forces quicker and expedite calling for fire and support.



With the use of satellite communication systems the Marine Corps is able to find locations to utilize as Forward Arming and Refueling Points. FARPs enable III Marine Expeditionary Force and the Marine Corps to rearm and refuel at hidden locations throughout the world. Ie Shima an island off of Okinawa Japan is one location that allows III MEF to extend their mission capabilities without the need to return to a forward operating base.



The Commandant of the Marine Corps Gen. David H. Berger’s Force Design 2030 lays out the need for modernization through technology. Transitioning from using the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) to the Navy/Marine Corps Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System (NMESIS) is one of many advancements highlighted in this guidance. NMESIS an unmanned weapon system can be positioned and hidden at remote locations allowing for the remote launch of anti-ship missiles.



“We [the Marine Corps] have to change” said Berger. “We have a lot of experimentation a lot of learning to do. We cannot wait to move out. We have to change we have to move out now. And we have to preserve enough to learn in the future over the coming years to make sure we get it right.”



The threat environment is changing; with the Commandant’s Planning Guidance and Force Design 2030 Marines are adapting and utilizing technology to counteract that change. Adjustments continue to be made to organizational and force design force structure force posture and naval and joint force integration.



“As we face the challenges in the future that gives me no end of confidence. Shoulder to shoulder with the fleet with the joint force with our allies and partners we are ready to take on all challenges” said Lt. Gen. James Bierman Commanding General III Marine Expeditionary Force. “Moving forward III MEF will continue to do whatever needs to be done. We will spare no effort to deter would-be adversaries to maintain peace in this region but if necessary we are prepared to deploy and fight and win on short notice.”

The answer lies in the past,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.

New York CNN Business —

The Federal Reserve’s favorite inflation-related adjective used to be transitory as in: Inflation is transitory and price increases should be temporary.

That is no longer the case. Inflation rates have been increasing sharply since August 2021 and have been out of the normal 2%-to-4% range for a full year. The Consumer Price Index rose 8.5% for the year ending in March a rate that hadn’t been seen since December of 1981.

So the central bank has broken up with “transitory” and set its eyes on a new inflation-modifying term: entrenched.

“It’s our job to make sure that inflation of that unpleasant high nature doesn’t get entrenched in the economy” said Fed Chair Jerome Powell last Wednesday just after he announced a half-point interest rate hike to combat inflation.

It’s unclear what exactly entrenched inflation looks like or how we’ll know if we’ve reached it. The Fed has given very little guidance in general on how long they predict it will take for their interest hikes to lower inflation. “It’s a very difficult environment to try to give forward guidance 60 90 days in advance” said Powell last week. “There are just so many things that can happen in the economy and around the world.”

There’s nothing investors hate more than uncertainty and as increasing rates pummel US markets they want more guidance. Americans who have been hard-hit by rising gas and food prices also want to know when they can finally feel some relief especially if the Fed’s rate hikes risk dragging the economy into a recession.

Looking back: Looking to the past could offer some insight: Although prices have been relatively stable over the past four decades large swings were not uncommon before the early 1980s.

History (and Fed data) show that the driver of inflation is important in predicting when rates will finally decrease: Prices grew at very rapid rates during World War I and World War II as a result of war-time constraints but fell again when peacetime resumed.

In the 1970s the US experienced its longest stretch of heightened inflation. President Richard Nixon removed the dollar from the gold standard and two surges in oil prices pushed inflation rates to 12.3% by late 1974. The Fed began practicing “stop-go” monetary policy raising benchmark rates as high as 16% and then quickly dropped them again leading to a cycle in which increased interest rates weren’t sustained for long enough to end inflation or increase growth.

By the late 1970s Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker took over and ended that policy. He raised rates and kept them high until inflation came down throwing the US into recession (its second of the decade) but finally permanently lowering inflation rates where they remained for the next 40 years.

“I have tremendous admiration for [Volcker].” said Powell last week when asked about his policy changes. “He had the courage to do what he thought was the right thing.”

Looking ahead: So will it take nearly 20 years and two recessions to get us back to normal? Powell certainly doesn’t think so. The economy is strong and the unemployment data looks nothing like it did in the 1970s Powell said. Many believe that we’ve already reached an inflationary peak and numbers are beginning to flatten.

Analysts often speak of the fears of 1970s stagflation and compare our current situations but today’s inflation is caused by a mixture of global crisis supply chain disruptions and growth in consumer demand after Covid-lockdowns shut down the economy.

“The inflationary period after World War II is likely a better comparison for the current economic situation than the 1970s and suggests that inflation could quickly decline once supply chains are fully online and pent-up demand levels off” wrote the White House Council of Economic Advisers in a recent white paper.

Still as growth slows and markets drop the two S phrases — stagflation and sticky inflation — get thrown around with increasing frequency.

Some investors think the answer is in the middle.

“We expect US inflation to slow over the next two years but the progress will be very uneven” wrote Bank Of America analysts in a recent note. “There is tentative evidence of an easing of supply chain challenges and we expect ‘two steps forward one step back’ process in the next year.” But this won’t be a decade-long struggle they predict. Prices should begin to ease by 2023.

Is Google an oasis of green in the great tech wreck?

It’s been a bad few weeks for tech stocks but analysts are still keen on at least one name: Google parent company Alphabet (GOOGL).

Tech titans have fallen victim to rising rates and lackluster earnings this spring. PayPal Amazon Facebook parent company Meta Platforms and Netflix all took nasty spills in April and the Nasdaq had its worst month in nearly 14 years.

The forward-thinking tech sector is particularly vulnerable to higher rates: investors expect tech companies to post electric growth but inflation and higher interest payments will take a big bite out of those profits.

But not all companies will be hurt equally by the great tech wreck of 2022 say analysts. Many see Google as a green oasis in a desert of red.

“Google has withstood a few recessions already and held up pretty well” said Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler. “Typically the last thing advertisers cut is their Google spend.”

The numbers add up: Google Search growth remained solid at 24% in the first quarter and Google Cloud revenues increased 44% during the same period. YouTube advertising revenue fell below expectations as advertisers in Europe pulled back at the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but YouTube’s scale remains unmatched with over 2 billion monthly active users. More than a third of YouTube viewers are not reached by any other ad-supported streaming service.

Alphabet has a more stable business than its peers do wrote Bank of America analysts in a recent note. It also outperforms in artificial intelligence and machine learning products has significant expense flexibility and a management team that is doing more for shareholders than other companies are.

About those shareholder perks: Alphabet doesn’t mind scratching its shareholders’ backs the company repurchased $52 billion of shares over the last 12 months and the board has authorized the repurchase of an additional $70 billion.

Management also announced earlier this year that Alphabet stock will be split 20-for-1 in early July.

Cheaper shares mean smaller retail investors can flood into the stock further raising prices. More liquidity usually means more protection from extreme swings and a split signals to investors that a company is thriving and in demand by shareholders.

Kessler warned that Google isn’t immune to the headwinds harming other companies. “We do expect slower growth this year than we saw last year” he said.

But in the long run said Kessler “we think Google probably has the strongest fundamentals in large cap internet names.”

The Reconstruction Finance Corp. (RFC) was an agency authorized by the U.S. government to loan money to assist the nation's ailing banks after the stock market crash of 1929 and during the Great Depression that followed.

Congress created the RFC in 1932 with a limited mandate to issue emergency loans to banks railroads and farmers threatened with insolvency. Its scope quickly expanded and it soon began lending money to state and local governments to finance public infrastructure projects. It outlived the Great Depression and later helped finance industries that were key to the nation's role in World War II.

The RFC was not fully abolished until 1957.

Key Takeaways The Reconstruction Finance Corp. was created to stabilize the nation's banks railroad industry and farms during the economic turmoil that marked the early years of the Great Depression.

Its role expanded greatly especially during the presidency of Franklin Roosevelt as it began funding local infrastructure projects and lending money to small businesses.

Later the RFC had an important role in funding the nation's preparation for its entrance into World War II.

The RFC's unusual status as a quasi-independent agency made it useful to President Roosevelt who could funnel money to public projects through it without Congressional oversight.

The RFC was scaled down and finally abolished in the years after World War II.

Understanding the Reconstruction Finance Corp. (RFC)

Congress created the RFC primarily to shore up the nation's banks which were collapsing under the strain of panic withdrawals from their customers as the Great Depression took hold.



It was intended to stay in business for only 10 years but the RFC continued and even expanded throughout the 1930s and the 1940s.

Soon after its creation the RFC expanded its lending activities beyond the nation's banks railroads and farms. It ultimately made loans to state and local governments as well as small businesses. When World War II broke out the RFC developed eight subsidiaries to focus on financing industrial production related to the nation's wartime needs.

History of the Reconstruction Finance Corp. (RFC)

The Emergency Relief Act created in the summer of 1932 broadened the agency's scope and power. It allowed the RFC to extend loans to local and state public works as well as farmers and small businesses.

In its initial years under President Herbert Hoover the RFC made little use of its expanded powers. After Franklin D. Roosevelt took office and the New Deal went into effect the agency sought more vigorously to support the recovery effort.

The RFC expanded even further during World War II to provide financing for the construction and operation of war plants and even loans to Allied foreign governments.

The original concept was that the RFC would be a non-political autonomous agency. During its earliest years the concept held.

However as the RFC continually expanded and assumed the hefty responsibility of doling out massive sums of money it became more subject to accusations of political favoritism in its decisions on loans.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) which protects bank deposits and the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) which regulates the financial markets are both products of Roosevelt-era reforms.

Beginnings

The bank panic was one of the symptoms of the Great Depression which began with the collapse of the stock market in 1929 and would continue until 1939. At the time America had more than 24000 independent banks most of them serving small communities and rural areas.

One bank after another collapsed as their customers lined up and withdrew their savings until the vaults were empty and the banks closed. The remaining customers lost their life savings. The panic spread from town to town.

The Federal Reserve had been created in 1913 specifically to prevent this type of crisis by providing emergency loans to banks. But only nationally-chartered banks were required to be Fed members. State-chartered banks including most of those small local banks were not members.

The Hoover Administration

In 1932 the Reconstruction Finance Corp. was created by Congress with the backing of President Herbert Hoover. Its mission was to provide emergency loans to three key sectors of the economy: banks railroads and farm crops.

The U.S. Treasury initially provided $500 million in funds to be distributed by the RFC.

The New Deal

The scope of the RFC and its funding expanded enormously after the election of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Its independence was a key benefit of the RFC from the politician's viewpoint: Its spending did not require Congressional authorization and did not appear in the federal budget.

The agency began to loan money to state and local governments to fund state and local public projects and to pay for relief programs for the unemployed. Assistance to cash-strapped farmers was greatly increased.

As the Great Depression continued many homeowners defaulted on their mortgages. The banks fearing more defaults made it even more difficult to obtain a mortgage. In yet another expansion of RFC powers it was empowered to create the Federal National Mortgage Association to guarantee mortgages. That association still exists and is known as Fannie Mae.

The Small Business Administration was created to fill a gap left by the dissolution of the RFC. Its creation acknowledged the importance of small businesses to the U.S. economy and the difficulty of their owners in getting financing through the private banking system.

World War II

By 1940 U.S. involvement in World War II appeared inevitable. No fewer than eight subsidiaries were added to the RFC to finance the development of materials necessary to the war and to replace imported materials that had become unobtainable.

End of the Reconstruction Finance Corp.

Post-depression and post-war the work of the RFC began to wind down.

In 1948 Congress began a series of investigations of political corruption within the RFC. One accusation was that the RFC had granted a loan to a customer of Boeing Corp. in return for Boeing's support of President Harry S. Truman.

The Senate Committee on Banking and Currency mandated an immediate reorganization leading to a restructuring of the RFC in 1952.

Despite the effort to revamp the agency accusations of mismanagement continued to surround the RFC. Just one year after the restructuring Congress passed the RFC Liquidation Act.

The agency was defunded and its remaining functions were slowly transferred to other agencies. The Small Business Administration was created in part to fill a void in government lending to small businesses that the RFC's disappearance created.

In 1957 the all-but-defunct RFC was dismantled entirely.

Economic Review of the Reconstruction Finance Corp.

The Reconstruction Finance Corp. filled the role of lender of last resort that in later years has been held by the Federal Reserve. Although it had been created in 1913 the Federal Reserve did not have the ability to lend to state-chartered banks. Nor did banks then have federal insurance to guarantee their deposits.

It was those state-chartered banks that served America's small businesses farms and consumers. And about 9000 of them failed between 1930 and 1933 taking their depositors' money with them.

The RFC must get some credit for stopping that spiral of destruction and preventing the U.S. from an economic collapse. Its record however is still debated:

A near-fatal decision to publish the names of banks seeking loans from the RFC may have caused some to shun the agency's help for fear of causing panic withdrawals.

A requirement for collateral for some RFC loans may have deprived banks of much of the liquidity they could have used to stabilize and expand their operations.



What Was the Main Purpose of the Reconstruction Finance Corp.? The original mandate of the Reconstruction Finance Corp. was to make emergency loans to keep American banks railroads and farms afloat through the worst of the Great Depression. The scope of its activities expanded greatly over the years. During the Depression it lent money to state and local governments to fund public works projects. During World War II it took a key role in funding the expansion of U.S. military capability and even loaned money to foreign governments.



How Did the Reconstruction Finance Corp. Impact the Great Depression? You think the 2008-2009 financial crisis was bad? The unemployment rate hit 24.9% during the Great Depression. Nearly half of the nation's banks failed. Industrial production dropped by half. The downturn lasted for 10 years. The Reconstruction Finance Corp. seems to have kept some banks up and running through the worst years of the depression. It took on a far more substantial role after 1932 when President Roosevelt used it to funnel much-needed money into state and local government projects and ailing small businesses.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvMDgvYnVzaW5lc3MvcnVzc2lhLW9saWdhcmNoLXlhY2h0LWFzc2V0cy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Selling Off Russian Oligarchs’ Assets Will Take Years,"The U.S. government was so pleased with its swift seizure of a Russian oligarch’s 255-foot yacht on the Mediterranean island of Majorca last month that it posted a video on YouTube of the moment F.B.I. agents and Spanish authorities clambered up the gangplank. The $90 million yacht owned by Viktor Vekselberg called the Tango was the government’s first big prize in a campaign against billionaires with close ties to the Kremlin.

The Tango is just a sliver of the $1 billion in yachts planes and artwork — not to mention hundreds of millions in cash — that the United States has identified as belonging to wealthy allies of Russia’s president Vladimir V. Putin since the invasion of Ukraine. U.S. Magistrate Judge Zia M. Faruqui who approved the seizure called the pursuit of the yacht by a new Justice Department team called task force kleptocapture “just the beginning of the reckoning that awaits those who would facilitate Putin’s atrocities.”

The reckoning may take a while.

Seizing assets whether a yacht or a bank account is the easy part. To permanently confiscate them the government must usually navigate a potentially cumbersome process known as civil forfeiture which requires proving to a judge that the assets were obtained from the proceeds of a crime or through money laundering. Only then does the government actually own the assets and have the power to liquidate them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpzb25saW5lLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL21qczA2MjQ1MdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John A.

The United States is in a maternal health crisis.

Maternal mortality and morbidity rates across the country have increased steadily over the past 20 years even as rates in all other developed countries have decreased significantly.

New government data shows that US maternal deaths jumped by 14% during the first years of the pandemic to 861 in 2020 from 754 in 2019. The rate of maternal deaths for Black women in the US was nearly three times higher than it was for white women over that time frame.

Goldman Sachs wants to change that. Mahmee a six-year-old maternal healthcare startup has announced the closing of a $9.2 million Series A funding round led by Goldman’s Growth Equity Business.

High maternal mortality rates in the US especially among minority groups have “become a systemic issue and something that we’re not paying attention to” said Mahmee founder and CEO Melissa Hanna. “But we can also turn this around.”

The investment is part of Goldman Sachs’ One Million Black Women initiative a $10 billion commitment to narrow opportunity gaps for Black women over the next decade.

Mahmee which has also received funding from Serena Williams and Mark Cuban hopes to build the digital infrastructure needed to bring patients and providers together and make healthcare data widely available in an industry where it’s often siloed.

“The reality is that most of the records systems that we use to track health information on mothers and babies don’t talk to each other” said Hanna.

Mahmee creates a unified record for each patient that shows all the health data of a mother in one place. The service also offers access to a national network of community-based health providers including in-house nurses and care coordinators who provide live support seven days a week. The coordinators monitor health needs offer referrals to health professionals and assist with questions and concerns from expectant mothers.

The company also works directly with institutions by selling their nurse-led coordination programs to a number of health services medical groups and insurance companies. Mahmee currently has over 750 providers and organizations in its network in 44 states.

Well-coordinated care has been proven to lead to better health outcomes and fewer hospitalizations according to research published in the Annals of Family Medicine but US patients are more likely to encounter gaps in those services than patients who live in other high-income nations the study found.

“We’ve been able to create some lifesaving interventions and point out things that other people may have just overlooked by accident or lack of experience” Hanna said.

Since launching in 2016 Mahmee has served over 15000 women Hanna said and those patients are 10% less likely to have a C-section and 50% less likely to deliver prematurely.

“Disparities in accessing high-quality maternal and perinatal care contribute to poor health outcomes in underserved communities and substantial costs for the broader healthcare system” said Suzanne Gauron global head of Launch With GS a Goldman Sachs program that aims to increase access to capital for underrepresented entrepreneurs and investors.”We believe Mahmee is well positioned to improve the lives of mothers and babies by narrowing critical opportunity gaps in care and outcomes.”

“The US has a relative undersupply of maternity care providers especially midwives and lacks comprehensive postpartum supports” wrote doctoral researcher Roosa Tikkanen in a report for The Commonwealth Fund examining the disparities.

America meanwhile is by some accounts the most expensive country to give birth in and the only developed country without mandated paid parental leave.

But this is not a purely philanthropic work Hanna said. Maternal and infant health care is a $160 billion industry in the United States. Failures in care coordination account for $27.2 billion to $78.2 billion in unnecessary medical fees and waste per year according to a 2019 Journal of the American Medical Association study.

“If we even scratch the surface of solving this problem for any mothers and babies in this country” said Hanna “we have unlocked billions of dollars of potential here.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vcnVzc2lhbnMtb2xpZ2FyY2hzLWx1eHVyeS1hc3NldHMtc29sZC11cy1iaWRlbi13aGl0ZS1ob3VzZS1wbGFuLTIwMjItNNIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vcnVzc2lhbnMtb2xpZ2FyY2hzLWx1eHVyeS1hc3NldHMtc29sZC11cy1iaWRlbi13aGl0ZS1ob3VzZS1wbGFuLTIwMjItND9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biden's proposal to sell oligarchs' assets would be difficult: experts,"Joe Biden (left) and the superyacht ""Tango"" seized by the US. Anna Moneymaker Levent Kisi/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images

A new order would authorize the US to sell assets belonging to Russian-sanctioned individuals.

The aim is for the proceeds to be used to help fund Ukraine's defense.

The US however only seized a $90 million 255-foot yacht belonging to Viktor Vekselberg.

A new executive order from President Joe Biden would grant the US wider authority to speed up the sale of assets seized from sanctioned Russian oligarchs and use the proceeds to support Ukraine as it fends off the Russian invasion.

Assets currently under US control include cash in US bank accounts as well as a $90 million 255-foot yacht belonging to Viktor Vekselberg which was captured earlier this month in Spain.

A 325-foot superyacht belonging to Suleiman Kerimov has also been seized in Fiji after the US requested Fijian authorities to carry out the seizure. The FBI later found evidence incriminating Kerimov of US crimes according to the Department of Justice.

Meanwhile a European Union taskforce has been particularly busy snagging more than $30 billion in boats helicopters real estate and artwork a European Commission official told Insider.

The US and the EU are joined by the UK Australia Canada and Japan as members of the Russian Elites Proxies and Oligarchs (REPO) Task Force which formed last month to track and coordinate the capture of sanctioned oligarchs' assets.

Although the order on April 28 from the White House says it aims to ""improve our ability to enforce foreign restraint and forfeiture orders in the United States"" experts told Insider the process is still unclear.

Transferring yachts to the US or the UK would incur considerable expense said Benjamin Maltby a partner at Keystone Law in the UK and an expert in yacht and luxury asset law. While selling them in place under US authority ""will only add another layer of unnecessary administrative expense and delay.""

Shane Riedel financial crimes expert and the CEO of Elucidate whose work focuses on monitoring financial transactions pointed to the period following the 1979 Iranian revolution when a lack of a legal framework to redirect funds frozen by Western governments meant they remained untouched in locked accounts for decades.

""When the sanctions against Iran were lightened"" referring to the lifting of the United Nations sanctions on Iran in 2016 ""there was a big export of cash"" Riedel said explaining that Republicans protested that the US was giving money to Iran when in fact it was Iranians' own frozen funds that had been held for 35 years.

""You can't liquidate those assets and use them for something else. There's neither precedent nor a clear framework for how that could happen"" Riedel added.

The Justice Department announced on April 4 that the seizure of Vekselberg's yacht as ""subject to forfeiture based on violation of US bank fraud money laundering and sanction statutes."" Britt Mosman a partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP said: ""From there the US government has broad discretion in disbursing seized and forfeited assets – including by selling the assets and distributing the proceeds.""

She said it would be difficult however for individual civil or criminal forfeiture actions to reach the scale needed to impact the rebuilding of Ukraine.







Since assets like yachts and real estate are hard to sell and costly to maintain the time they spend in legal limbo can add up to significant costs to the governments – and their taxpayers – who seize them. ""You could have a really perverse scenario where governments like the US UK Fiji or others are forced to actually subsidize those assets until such time as they're then forced to give them back – which is crazy"" Riedel said.

""Members of the REPO Task Force would be more incentivized to cooperate with the US in forfeiture actions if there is a clear pathway for the seized property to be liquidated and then used to remediate harms of Russian aggression toward Ukraine"" Mosman added.

While assets belonging to oligarchs may be seized some of their wealth wouldn't necessarily be tied to Russia as Shiedel added that in some cases they have made their fortune outside of Russia. This includes Oleg Deripaska for whom parts of his wealth were generated in Switzerland on the back of activities there."

It's a bummer to lose any personal belonging that you hold near and dear but there are two items that are inevitably the most frustrating and depending on the situation that you're in scariest to lose and that's your wallet and cell phone. Some would even argue that because of the ability to make purchases through a mobile device these days thanks to handy-dandy NFC technology there are some who'd rather lose their wallet as most folks' only piece of consumer tech that they rock to do pretty much everything in their lives are their smartphones.

And things get even worse if the bulk of your livelihood centers around your phone like let's say if you're an Influencer who travels around to different parts of the country scoping out and documenting events you frequent and share with your followers. And that's unfortunately what happened to TikToker Becca Moore.

Many of Becca's posts center around her misadventures in dating along with other daily encounters and situations that she gets herself into. And in a now-viral clip she talks about the time she went to Coachella when a guy began flirting with her. Turns out the dude was a thief who decided to relieve her of her wallet phone and keys.

@becccamooore the uber driver that saved me from going missing is @buds4u559!! 😭 after spending the day w him he told me his daughter is a senior in high school & is having a hard time going through chemo. i made a gofundme he could’ve left me and didn’t have to help me the way he did! I’d love to help his fam give his daughter a normal end to her senior year of high school this year (prom!!) i’m putting it in my bio!! ♬ original sound - becca moore Source: TikTok | @becccamooore

She begins the video by stating: ""I went to Coachella this weekend and I thought this guy was kinda hitting on me but then he just robbed me."" She explained the situation to staff members at the hotel who called an Uber on her behalf so they could take her to a nearby cell phone store so she could purchase a new device. And she ended up making an ally in the process.

That ally was Uber driver Raul Torres: ""A normal Uber driver takes you to a place and then drops you off. He insisted on coming in with me and making sure that I was gonna have a ride after that"" Becca said.

The two decided to team up to try and find the perpetrator who stole from the Influencer. Raul took Becca to the police station to file a report and managed to uncover the alleged thief's identity. Raul then accompanied Becca and the police officers who searched for her belongings but they came up short. Raul didn't stop helping her however.

Ultimately they were able to locate the phone presumably using ""Find my iPhone"" or a similar feature and thankfully they were able to find the phone. It was left outside of an Airbnb.

Becca was thoroughly touched by Raul's commitment to helping her get her phone back and during their journey to recover her belongings they got Starbucks and then went out for margaritas together after the wild goose chase.

""We went on an entire adventure from 10 a.m to 6 p.m which should’ve been an entire day of work for him and towards the end of the day is when I started realizing he actually needed more help than I did"" local news outlet KGET reported the Influencer as saying. The outlet also highlighted the dedication Raul had to hustling: he drove all the way from Fresno Calif. to Indio Calif. in order to more rides from Coachella attendees so he could give some cash to his teenage daughter — it's a five and a half hour drive.

Becca also learned that both Raul's daughter and father were diagnosed with cancer and he helps to take care of the both of them. After seeing how much he was willing to help her despite everything that was going on in his life Becca launched a GoFundMe to assist the Uber Driver and tell people about her positive interactions with him.

""So usually I use my platform to talk about like boys my dating life and stupid things that now I really see are just surface level. It means a lot that I can help him back"" Becca said.

His phone would usually be constantly ringing with order requests but not that day.

“Two-hours-and-a-half passed by and I wasn’t getting any deliveries” Guerrero told Fortune. “I’m like ‘What’s going on?’”

But when he switched his app to show he was willing to deliver orders by bike instead of by foot the usual rhythm of orders resumed.

Guerrero who delivers full time in New York City called UberEats customer service more than five times and was told it was likely a glitch in the app and that he should reset his phone. As of Thursday Guerrero was still making less than what he usually did two weeks ago. Instead of earning the usual $500 to $600 for 60 to 75 deliveries last week he said he made $320 to $370 working nearly double the hours he used to.

The lag in orders is caused by a change to the UberEats algorithm Guerrero thinks. Although he said he lacks proof he’s noticed that delivery drivers are getting priority with the orders they don’t want pushed to bikers. He said he believes the orders that the other two groups reject are passed to delivery walkers.

A spokesperson for UberEats said that the company is not phasing out walking couriers on its app but that it recently made a change to how orders are routed to couriers based on who has the quickest delivery time. The spokesperson said that the change takes into account the location of each courier.

“We have not phased out couriers who deliver on foot and we have no plans to” an UberEats spokesperson said in a statement to Fortune. “We are simply encouraging couriers to bike when possible to ensure the most reliable delivery times for consumers.”

An email from the company sent to couriers on April 8 said “We’re changing the way courier trip requests are sent. (Hint: wheels > feet.)” The company said it has also provided delivery workers with information about biking and discounted bike rental options across the country—at least one of which is UberEats own partnership with bike rental company Zoomo. After a $150 refundable deposit and a free week the Zoomo bike rentals start at $49 weekly with an additional $12 per week “theft protection” charge according to the company’s website.

Yet UberEats delivery workers who spoke to Fortune say that the changes to the app have been poorly communicated. And some workers including three who spoke to Fortune said they either don’t want to ride a bike or that they feel unsafe riding one in their city.

Guerrero 31 preferred delivering food by foot because he said he used to make more money delivering multiple orders over shorter distances. But because his order volume has declined he’s started renting an electric bike through the UberEats and Zoomo program for $66 a week to get more orders.

A 59-year-old walking courier named Lila who requested her last name not be used for fear of retaliation by UberEats said renting a bike isn’t an option for her because she doesn’t feel safe biking in New York City where she lives and works.

Lila said she works as a presentation and graphic designer on contract but delivers for UberEats on the side to make extra money for her mom. Yet for the last four weeks in walker mode she has only gotten four order requests she said. Repeated calls to customer support got Lila nowhere she said.

“Over and over and over again the same thing: uninstall your app power down reinstall it make sure you have the right version. You know they’re telling me all this stuff and there’s still nothing going on in the walkers mode at all” Lila told Fortune.

Frustrated Lila did a test on her own to see if there was a difference in the frequency of orders between walking and biking modes.

Logged in as a biker recently for more than four hours she received 52 order requests. Some were for distances as short as 0.3 to 0.7 miles that she said she could have covered as a walker.

When she switched to walking mode she said she got zero requests. Now she said she is considering dropping the app because the scarcity of orders makes working for UberEats not worth the effort.

Patrick Dayrit an 18-year-old college student in New York City who delivers for UberEats part-time by foot said although he’s not worried about his own financial situation after a drop in orders he thinks the changes will hurt many walking delivery workers who depend on the app for their income.

A spokesperson for UberEats said walking trips are just a small fraction of its deliveries and that most walking deliveries are in densely populated areas.

Dayrit started a Change.org petition that has so far garnered 201 signatures asking UberEats to go back to its previous system for walkers and bikers who he said have also experienced a drop in the number of order requests they receive.

“They have families to support and it’s just really concerning how Uber is just taking that away for them and leaving them with no other option” Dayrit said.

Because order requests are now so low Guerrero said he has no choice but to double the hours he works for UberEats to make the same money. He applied to deliver for DoorDash one of UberEats delivery competitors but said there is a waiting list to be accepted.

For now he’ll continue delivering on his e-bike while he waits to see if anything changes.

“If you’re deciding to make changes that affect our livelihood at least notify us” Guerrero said. “Treat us like people.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZ29sZi5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL2Zvb2Qvc2VjcmV0LXRvLW1ha2luZy1jcnVzaGJ1cmdlci1hY2NvcmRpbmctdG8tZ29sZi1jbHViLWNoZWYv0gFZaHR0cHM6Ly9nb2xmLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZm9vZC9zZWNyZXQtdG8tbWFraW5nLWNydXNoYnVyZ2VyLWFjY29yZGluZy10by1nb2xmLWNsdWItY2hlZi8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The secret to making the uber-popular ‘Crushburger’ according to a golf-club chef,"The secret to making the uber-popular ‘Crushburger’ according to a golf-club chef

One of the Crushburger's many tasty attributes is a toasted brioche bun. Getty Images

Welcome to Clubhouse Eats where we celebrate the game’s most delectable food and drink. Hope you brought your appetites.

***

Tour pros aren’t the only ones crushing it these days.

Chefs are doing the same.

Except that what they’re crushing is ground beef.

The result is an increasingly popular item at restaurants pop-ups and golf course grill rooms coast to coast.

Some know it as the smash burger.

But at Arcis Golf a course operator with some 70 private public and resort clubs in its portfolio they call it the Crushburger.

Among the Arcis clubs that serve it is the Dominion Country Club in San Antonio where Jay Nash wears the toke.

We asked Nash what sets this breed of burger apart in the hopes that we too might start crushing it at home.

The Meat of the Matter

In theory anyway you could make a Crushburger with ground pork ground chicken ground duck and on. “Umm but why?” Nash says. “Cows are good eating.” Just make sure it’s high-quality beef.

A Ball Not a Patty

When you shape ground beef into a patty you can overwork the meat which can lead to a tougher finished product. With the Crushburger thereis no such risk because well you’re not making a patty at all. What you do instead is shape the ground beef into a meatball which then gets smashed on a hot griddle under special griddle weights. The process creates a large surface area with a beautiful sear and Nash says because the smashing only happens at the start of the cooking you lose less moisture with juicier results.

The Seasoning

Nash says this is a secret kept locked in a vault. That’s the bad news. The good news is there’s no going wrong with salt and pepper.

The Toppings

Nash says the sauce atop the Crushedburger is also secret but we know it starts with mayonnaise and no he doesn’t work for the CIA. What we can also say for certain is that there are sliced tomatoes and lettuce. Where you go from there is a matter of choice. Some of us believe that ketchup diminishes most everything it touches. But have at it if you like it. Mustard. Onions. Pickles. Relish. The world is your condiment jar.

And the Bun

Brioche toasted and buttered. That’s what Nash suggests for rich delicious flavor and appealing crunch.

Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE: UBER) released the latest earnings report delivering growth in mobility booking and total revenue. Yet net loss widened to almost US$6b owing to equity investments and significant stock-based compensation.

Despite surprise in 3 out of 5 latest earnings reports the stock has been steadily declining losing over 55% from its peak.

View our latest analysis for Uber Technologies

First-quarter 2022 results:

US$3.04 loss per share (down from US$0.058 loss in 1Q 2021).

Revenue: US$6.85b (up 136% from 1Q 2021).

Net loss: US$5.93b (loss widened US$5.82b from 1Q 2021).

Revenue exceeded analyst estimates by 12%. Earnings per share (EPS) missed analyst estimates by 972%.

Performance per segment:

Mobility: US$10.7b (+58% Y/Y)

Delivery: US$13.9b (+12% Y/Y)

Freight: US$1.8b

Over the next year revenue is forecast to grow 44% compared to a 16% growth forecast for the industry in the US. Over the last 3 years on average earnings per share have increased by 62% per year but its share price has fallen by 14% per year which means it is significantly lagging behind earnings.

Can we expect growth from Uber Technologies?

Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re buying a stock especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Uber Technologies' earnings are expected to increase by 27% in the upcoming year indicating an optimistic future ahead.

Yet looking at the earnings projection it is likely that the company is at least 2 years away from reaching positive numbers.

What does this mean for investors?

Ride-hailing companies have been on a prolonged decline yet Uber fared much better than its main rival Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT) which dropped over 30% in the last week alone. Uber owes this to its successful diversification efforts as its food delivery division (Uber Eats) remains the biggest segment showing surprising post-pandemic resilience.

While losing US$3 per share at the share price of US$30 looks concerning one has to be aware this is due to unrealized losses. The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) now requires this from publicly listed companies which often results in some spectacular numbers. The best example was the Amazon earnings in February 2022 beating the estimate by over 660% due to unrealized gains on Rivian investment. Reflecting on this situation Uber CFO Nelson Chai stated that the company has the liquidity to sit on those positions and wait for the situation to improve.

Although reporting unrealized losses from equity investments isn’t the best outlook for an unprofitable company we’re more concerned about US$359m of stock-based compensation which is excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Even for a US$50b company this is a significant number that continues to weigh on the company. Despite all the accounting smoke and mirrors we believe that stock options are compensation and thus an expense for the company – just like Warren Buffett explained 30 years ago.

(Xinhua/Rachen Sageamsak)

BANGKOK May 8 (Xinhua) -- China's women's badminton team swept Australia 5-0 on Sunday to begin their quest to defend their Uber Cup title.

In the opening singles Tokyo Olympic gold medalist Chen Yufei had a close first set with world No. 72 Chen Hsuan-yu by only winning 21-19. But Chen then took control of the match with a 21-10 win in the second set.

Returning to the Uber Cup as defending champions only after seven months Chen said she would not consider the past results too closely. ""What's important is focusing on right now and giving everything I have.""

In the following doubles China didn't start their world No. 1 duo Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan but Zhang Shuxian and Zheng Yu easily overcame Joyce Chong and Angela Yu 21-12 21-12.

In the second singles He Bingjiao crushed Louisa Ma 21-6 21-6 in only 20 minutes to secure victory for China.

In the two remaining matches Du Yue and Li Wenmei beat Kaitlyn Ea and Gronya Somerville 21-11 21-5 while Zhang Yiman defeated Tiffany Ho 21-6 21-9. ■

She unscrews a tiny pot revealing a clue. “I’m a bit of a bright girl” she says of her shade preferences among Keys Soulcare’s new cheek tints. The vivid geranium in her hand is called Powerful part of a nomenclature that aims to lend a spiritual boost to those so inclined. “You might need a little more energy and you need the power” she floats. (In fact I do though the makeup artist in the next room has aptly paired me with the ruddy clay-colored Enigmatic.) Keys points out the fine print along the glass rim one of the mantras that accompanies each item in her wellness collection: I choose my own path.

That much is true of the Grammy-decorated musician who has carved out a singular place in the conversation around beauty beginning with a bare-faced photo shoot in 2016. For Keys who landed her first major-label record deal at 15 the world of ever-present cameras reinforced a cycle of stress for her touch-and-go skin. “I always felt I had to cover it and cover it and cover it and it just got worse and worse and worse” recalls Keys looking back on her headline-making decision to pare it all back. As a luminous face of the makeup-free movement it made sense that she would launch Keys Soulcare in 2020 with a bakuchiol-powered face cream. Now with an edited collection of “skin-color hybrids”—including tinted lip balm clear brow gel and cream blush all of which Keys debuted on the Met Gala red carpet—she’s rewriting that narrative once again.

The first Keys Soulcare makeup launches—tinted lip balm cream blush brow gel and complexion brush—follow the hybrid model of the niacinamide-boosted illuminating serum. Courtesy of Keys Soulcare.

It’s an exercise in navigating between the all-or-nothing poles. There might be absolutists who shake their heads at her return to flushed lips and liquid liner. “People like to keep you in that box and never let you out” says the musician who tends to avoid the rabbit hole of internet comments. “I realized along my journey that the only beauty standard is the one you create.” That sentiment inspired the collection’s overarching name: not makeup but Make You. “I was asking myself ‘Who do you want to be? You want to be this person that’s freaking out when you pick up your son from school because you don't have a full beat or are you just a human who experiences life in different ways?’” she says.

Such flexibility is embedded in the formulas themselves. The lip balm—offered in five shades along with a transparent version—imparts a buildable wash of color within an avocado oil–enriched base. Similarly the cheek tint (featuring sunflower and safflower seed oils) is designed to mimic a naturalistic flush. The coexistence of a stripped-back aesthetic alongside an adorned one is more than a tenet in Keys’ beauty philosophy. It’s also the structure of her 2021 album Keys with sparer piano-accompanied tracks (“Originals”) side by side with room-filling produced versions (“Unlocked”). “Sometimes you want to turn up and sometimes you want to turn down and that’s your prerogative” says Keys.

There’s one volume shift on the musician’s mind lately: her long-awaited tour which will take her through European arenas before she makes the rounds Stateside. (In August she plays Radio City Music Hall a short walk away from her childhood roots in Hell’s Kitchen.) “My new song ‘City of Gods’ is a kind of New York anthem and it just feels so good to sing” she says when asked what tracks are itching for a larger audience. “There’s one off the Alicia record called ‘Authors of Forever’—I love that because it says that we’re the authors of our own story.”

By now she knows how to recreate the comforts of home while on the road. “The Keys Soulcare candle that’s a must” she says of the oat milk–sage blend (fitting for a singer who avoids dairy for her vocal performance). “These gummies are literally on my rider” she says brightly holding up a bag of SmartSweets. “They have four grams of sugar yet you still get that sweet high! And I always have a humidifier in the room. That helps a lot.”

A likely addition to the rider might be a fresh stack of tinted lip balms which have arrived just in time for a subset of fans: mothers like Keys who appreciate that balance of practical and feel-good. Is there a gift she’s wishing for that hits that same sweet spot? “The only thing I ever usually want for Mother’s Day is about three hours to read” she says with a laugh imagining a kid-free afternoon with a bathtub and a book. “Just maybe I fall into a nap” she adds painting a reverie that sounds like the lip balm’s mantra: I put myself first. “That type of vibe.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vOTczdGhlZGF3Zy5jb20vbXlzdGVyeS1zb2x2ZWQtd2Utbm93LWtub3ctd2hhdHMtaGFwcGVuaW5nLWF0LXRhcmdldC1vbi1hbWJhc3Nkb3ItY2FmZmVyeS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mystery Solved -- We Now Know What's Happening at Target on Ambassdor Caffery,"For several days now I've seen on social media folks asking questions regarding some things going on in the parking lot of Target on Ambassador Caffery in Lafayette.

There seemed to be very few answers as to what was going on. (I guessed the revival of the Bennigan's Blarney Blast but apparently that was a pipe dream.)

Well it appears that the correct answer has been found.

Lafayette City Councilwoman Liz Webb Hebert took to Facebook today to inform everyone what she found out after contacting the store.

The answer is pretty simple -- it's an extensive remodel.

Here are the details sent to Councilwoman Hebert regarding the remodel:

Target Lafayette has been chosen for a state of the art Re-model which is now underway! Over the next few months we will be adding new product assortments updating fixtures and décor expanding key categories including local products and adding an Ulta Beauty inside our store! Target is thankful for the support of our Guests over the years from our Lafayette and surrounding communities and we are excited to be able to invest back into the community! Our newly re-modeled store will make it faster and safer than ever to shop in-store or by selecting many of our same day services such as On-line Order and Pick-up in store Drive Up or SHIPT. The inspiration for these re-models is always our Guests and we are excited to create an only-at-Target experience they can continue to turn to for years to come!

This sounds exciting although a few folks are curious as to why an Ulta Beauty would be added inside the store when there is one right across the street.

I'm sure that will all shake out somehow and if it means Ulta on both sides of the road then so be it.

I did see where Target opened 100 Ulta Beauty shops inside their stores in 2021 and had plans to open more than 250 new locations by the end of 2022.

Also in doing a little digging I found that this overall remodel is part of Target Corporation's remodel program with 200 top-to-bottom renovations of its existing fleet.

So it looks like one of our Lafayette Target locations is in that number.

""Years of investment in our team and business have driven our sales beyond $100 billion and positioned Target to meet the needs of our guests no matter how they choose to shop"" said Michael Fiddelke CFO of Target. ""We see substantial opportunities to build on our core capabilities to drive deeper guest engagement and long-term growth.""

We'll also pry a bit to find out when the renovations should be complete and how it will affect your shopping experience during the growing pains.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9iZWF1dHkvbGFkeS1nYWdhLWhhdXMtbGFib3JhdG9yaWVzLW1ha2V1cC1iZWF1dHktYnJhbmQtc2VwaG9yYS1saW5lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lady Gaga's Haus Laboratories Beauty Line Is Coming to Sephora: 'Dream Come True',"Lady Gaga is coming to a Sephora near you!

The Grammy Award winner 36 announced Sunday that her vegan and cruelty-free cosmetics brand Haus Laboratories will be carried by the beauty retailer next month with a brand new lineup of products.

""I'm extremely excited to announce that we are bringing brand-new supercharged clean artistry makeup to the world through a place that has inspired me for years Sephora!"" Gaga wrote on Instagram. ""At Haus Labs artistry is for everyone and no one should have to damage their skin or sacrifice their principles and values to be self-expressive with high-performance makeup.""

The ""Plastic Doll"" singer noted that the brand will be available June 9 on Sephora's website for those in the United States and Canada (and globally on HausLabs.com) as well as in 25 stores before expanding to more locations. Additionally they'll roll out new products this fall. ""I know you're going to love them as much as we do!"" Gaga added.

""Thank you from the bottom of my heart for helping make this dream come true. The Future Is Beautiful. — xx @ladygaga"" she concluded.

Lady Gaga launched Haus Laboratories exclusively on Amazon in Sept. 2019. The line was inspired by her early days as an aspiring singer shopping for makeup before shows at drugstores in New York City.

""Color is completely transformative — it's powerful it's beautiful and it's how I found my voice with makeup"" she said at the time. ""I discovered myself but also other people discovered me for me through the way that I was expressing myself.""

The Chromatica artist (born Stefani Germanotta) previously expanded on how makeup has helped her evolve and develop her music persona during an interview with Allure for their Best of Beauty issue in 2019.

""I never felt beautiful and I still have days that I don't feel beautiful"" she said. ""All of the insecurities that I've dealt with my whole life from being bullied when I was younger they come right back up to bite me.""

""I put makeup on and before I know it I feel this superhero within. It gives me those wings to fly. When I became Lady Gaga when I was younger it was because I discovered makeup.

We’re all done streaming the final episodes of the iconic Grace and Frankie ( season 7 dropped at the end of April if you missed the memo) and we still can’t get over the finale or that Dolly Parton cameo .

In an interview with Vogue  Tomlin’s makeup artist Bonita De Haven revealed how she matched Tomlin’s makeup look to enhance her colorful wardrobe–and the perfect primer she used to ensure the makeup stayed in place: .

“Shoot days can be long and primer gave her foundation and makeup the ability to last” De Haven told Vogue. The makeup pro turned to for the ultimate long-lasting wear.



“Her makeup needed to reflect natural while enhancing her lovely features” De Haven said. The most important step in Tomlin’s makeup routine was the primer which creates the perfect base to smooth fine lines reduce shine and set the stage for her face makeup.

And this product is a fan favorite. With nearly 1400 Amazon reviews and a 4.5-star rating it’s no wonder De Haven trusted this on Tomlin. The product boasts a three-in-one capability that works as a primer moisturizer and a tightening mask–and reviewers are all about it.

One customer raved “The moment you apply it to your face your skin feels firm and moisturized. Applying your foundation and other products goes on smoothly and [lasts] all day. I think it’s a great product for women of all ages.” Other reviewers said it’s a “fantastic primer for older women” and others claim it “fills in lines tightens and improves staying power of foundation.”

And when it came to Tomlin’s ultra-long grey locks her hairstylist Marlene Williams revealed Tomlin actually used a full lace-front wig that was air-dried and touched up with a curling iron and lightweight hair oil to add definition and tame flyaways. Williams reached for the to get the job done.

If you were as sad as we were about the end of the incredible Netflix show–don’t worry! The two ladies revealed they’re working on a major new project after Grace & Frankie ends  so we’ll be on the lookout for their next big thing.

Along with McDonald’s and Burger King Wendy’s makes up the Big Three of U.S. fast-food burger chains. The Ohio-based company has more than 7000 restaurants worldwide that serve up its famous square burgers and Frosty milk shakes. Wendy’s fans who qualify for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits can use their SNAP electronic benefits payment (EBT) cards at participating Wendy’s restaurants though their choices are very limited.

See: Does Taco Bell take EBT Food Stamps?

Find: Does KFC Accept SNAP EBT Cards?

Only select Wendy’s locations in a handful of California counties accept SNAP EBT cards for purchases according to a 2021 Frugal Reality article. The Wendy’s website does not offer details on which of its locations accept SNAP EBT cards for payment.

SNAP is a federal program designed for families who need financial help buying food. Consumers used to pay with food stamps but now use reloadable EBT debit cards. Although SNAP is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture the program itself is administered at the state level.

Under the SNAP Restaurant Meals Program (RMP) qualified SNAP recipients can purchase food at SNAP authorized restaurants using their EBT cards according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Participating restaurants must offer meals at discount prices. In some cases the program lets recipients buy food in the deli sections of participating grocery stores. The idea is to help SNAP recipients get hot prepared foods at restaurants — something many are unable to do at grocery stores.

To participate in the RMP a restaurant must be located in a state that has an RMP get approval from the state and provide a signed agreement to the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) — and be authorized by FNS to accept SNAP benefits.

As GOBankingRates previously reported seven states have opted into the RMP. It is widely available in Arizona and California while five other states — Illinois Maryland Michigan Rhode Island and Virginia — offer the program in select cities or counties.

As well New York has passed a law that lets state social services agencies apply to the federal program.

To use your EBT card at Wendy’s you must live in California and qualify for the CalFresh RMP per your state requirements. Wendy’s does not accept EBT cards for online in-app delivery or pickup orders placed via DoorDash Uber Eats Postmates or Grubhub according to Frugal Reality.

Residents in all emirates have raised concerns about receiving fake SMS messages or emails from scammers asking them to pay Dh4 to claim a parcel.

The fraudsters have been using names and logos of well-known courier companies to avoid rousing suspicion. According to police reports in various emirates many individuals have fallen victim to this fraud which drained money from their bank accounts.

Fahad Rashid Al Ameri who has received the fake text repeatedly said the scam will only be combated through awareness campaigns spread by police to educate community members about the dangers of responding to such messages which are aimed at seizing bank data.

Since the scammers impersonate established courier companies Al Ameri said victims may unknowingly respond to their text especially since they're only asked to pay a small amount ranging between Dh4 and Dh12.

Mohamed Zakir another resident said people may click on the attached link make the payment process and later discover that their bank data has been stolen. This method of phishing hinges on the idea that the victim will think a family member requested the shipment and proceed to make the payment to the fake courier company.

Zakir stressed that individuals should investigate the accuracy of the information in these messages and ensure its authenticity before clicking on fake links.

Aisha Al Shamsi said her aunt had fallen victim to the fraud and Dh10000 had been withdrawn from her bank account. She lodged a complaint at the police station. Al Shamsi said awareness campaigns are the most effective way to confront the danger of electronic fraud gangs.

The rise in phishing

Since the Covid-19 pandemic more and more customers have been shopping online instead of going to stores and malls. This is one of the main reasons why such phishing cases have been on the rise said a cybersecurity expert at Dubai Police.

Most fraudsters send emails and texts impersonating reputed sources or companies. In the case of the courier scam the link in the message leads to a fake webpage that is designed to look like an official company website.

Customers are then tricked into entering sensitive information such as bank details credit card numbers and CVV codes to pay a fraudulent delivery fee. However a delivery never takes place. Instead phishers use the information entered to harvest personal data and withdraw money from victims' bank accounts or make expensive purchases.

The official urged community members to remain vigilant and watch out for linguistic errors in the body of the message or impersonal statements such as 'Dear Sir/Dear Madam' as these may indicate that the sender is seeking to steal information.

""Before entering payment data on any website or application it must be ensured that it is the official site or application of the delivery company"" he stressed.

Anyone who encounters fake websites or receives a notification of an unexpected delivery should report the matter to police.

Maj-Gen Saif Al Zeri Al Shamsi commander-in-chief of Sharjah Police warned of other methods related to the courier fraud where after customers click on a link and enter the card data a fake one-time password is generated. If victims fail to realise that it is not from their bank the fraudster may use the information to complete the purchase transaction.

How to protect yourself from scams

Colonel Omar Abu Al Zoud CID director at Sharjah Police identified seven tips to protect residents from falling victim to fraud:

1. Do not click on links in emails or text messages without ensuring they're legitimate.

2. Make sure that a family member is expecting a shipment to arrive.

3. Carefully read messages and verify the source.

4. Ensure the legitimacy of email addresses. Fake ones are often very similar to the original address.

5. Avoid providing bank data through WhatsApp.

6. Carefully read one-time password messages sent by the bank.

7. Ignore online promotions that seem too good to be true.

High end luxury finishes were just as described. Loved the Shock Hill location too. Will definitely book again! We stayed at the home in early August and it was a perfect location to downtown and the mountain. The space of the home was wonderful – master on the top floor just off the foyer with beautiful views in every room on the main and 3 additional rooms on the lower level each with a bathroom making it convenient for families or multiple guests. You can see the gondola from the kitchen living room and balcony space and its a 3 minute walk from the front door to take down to town or up the mountain. Fireplace hot tub and an outdoor dining table make it enjoyable to relax outside in the warmer months. Easy access to hiking trails just off the road and can cruise into town in less than 5 minutes! Highly recommend this space for a large group or family. My family of 5 and another couple had the best time at the home. The location to the Mid-Station was amazing and the features in the house were really cool. There are hiking trails are in every direction near the house. Their was even a stampede of deer that came through the street one night while we were enjoying the hot tub. We look forward to staying here again in the winter. Read Less ∧ Read More ∨ View Deal

When his lease was up for renewal last year his landlord wanted to raise his monthly rent from about S$3000 to S$9500 which would have been higher than the S$8000 or so he was paying before the Covid-19 pandemic.

In October last year he officially closed Alfa Cafe and gave up the lease for his kitchen. He then converted the dining area for the fish soup store which was located a few shops away and leased from a different landlord into a bakery to focus on online sales.

“We had many issues with the landlord (for my kitchen). We paid him more than a million dollars over the 30 years and rent was always paid on the dot” Mr Lim 51 said.

He leases his shops from private landlords not from the mall because Lucky Plaza is a strata-titled development where units were individually sold to different owners. Other malls may be owned by a single developer that leases shop space.

As the economy reopens some tenants said that they are now looking at paying higher rent than before Covid-19 struck in 2020.

OWNERS FORCED TO CLOSE SHOP

In interviews with nine tenants from various malls in the heartlands and along the Orchard Road shopping belt many of them said that their rental costs were raised when they renewed their leases in the past 12 months.

The majority saw a 10 per cent increase compared with pre-Covid levels but some experienced hikes of up to 30 per cent.

Some of the shop owners facing higher rent when their lease expire later this year said that they have chosen to close some stores or relocate to a different mall.

Ms Grace Tan director of ToTT Store said that when the lease for the kitchenware and cooking school’s outlet at Century Square in Tampines was up for renewal in mid-last year the mall had tried to increase the rent but she managed to negotiate for a one-year extension with no change in price.

Then when negotiations started again in December last year for the renewal the mall offered her a 30 per cent more expensive rental price.

“We did not think it was fair to go up by that much so we countered with a 10 per cent increase and they refused to accept it” Ms Tan said.

The ToTT branch was already making a loss that year so she has decided to move out of the mall when the lease expires in June this year.

The company has since signed new leases at i12 Katong mall on East Coast Road and IMM at Jurong East.

It has another outlet at Suntec City mall and the company managed to renew its three-year lease at a lower price last June.",,,,,,,,,

Wong at the Department of Health’s “Looking Back Marching Forward” event on April 29 at the Conrad Hotel Pasay City.

Thank you for giving me this opportunity to share my thoughts. Greetings to Secretary Duque and his team at the DOH to Dr. Kazai and his team at the WHO and to my colleagues who advised the DOH and the IATF. It’s nice to see all of you in person after two years in the trenches together. The pandemic required a whole-of-society approach but looking at the people assembled in this room I see that it also required a lifecourse approach. In this room and among the experts I see former professors and classmates from UP medical school. I also see former students from Ateneo where I teach.

I was at a former student’s wedding last December 2021 just after the deadly and exhausting Delta surge. A stranger also a guest at the party walked up to me and said: “I’ve seen you on TV.” And then she said “Thank you for your service.” With that she quietly walked away. It was just five words but I consider my service fully paid.

The pandemic has not ended yet but let me offer lessons for UHC that I learned from the pandemic:

UHC needs to ensure that all Filipinos have a primary care provider. During the pandemic many Filipinos did not know they were suffering from a comorbidity because they did not have a primary care provider and therefore did not qualify for priority vaccination.

We need to go back to the basics of public health. During the pandemic mortality from all infectious diseases not called COVID decreased. This was an unexpected but beneficial consequence of the COVID interventions. So we have to go back to basics. Public health is not just surveillance and statistics; it is also clean air clean hands and knowing enough to cover your mouth and nose when you’re sick (or health literacy).

The schism between medicine and public health or personal services and population services need to be healed. Health is only possible when both fields are integrated.

We need to identify where disease is but also where their causes are. Instead of just mapping disease at the barangay level let’s also map the things that cause ill health: pollution food deserts poverty unemployment low education and out-of-pocket health expenditures.

Multisectoral policy and action need to be enabled by decision-making methods that account for multiple criteria. The IATF brought together multiple government agencies to battle a health crisis whose causes and effects oftentimes lie outside the health system. However we need better processes for making complex decisions based on multiple sometimes competing criteria values and preferences.

Wisdom does not only reside in experts. I present a design challenge: How might we create structures and processes so that: People can also be policy advocates? People can be co-developers of services? People can be more able self-carers and caregivers?

How do we release the creativity of communities? In the past two years we have seen community pantries rise to address the problem of lockdown-related hunger. Communities need to be allowed to develop their own solutions while still being consistent with the national vision.

Filipinos need to regain their trust in government and in each other. Finally in a global study of factors associated with the reduction of COVID infections the IHME found that more than testing contact tracing or lockdowns it was social capital (bonding bridging and linking) that had the strongest association with the reduction of infections. Better health outcomes are primarily driven by the trust that people have in their government and in each other.

Today the DOH celebrates the experts. But there are other people here whose service we also need to be grateful for. So let me end by quoting from a speech of Teddy Roosevelt given a little over 112 years to the day at the Sorbonne in Paris while on his way to Oslo to receive his Nobel Peace Prize. The speech is commonly known as the “Man in the Arena.” I’ll paraphrase it a little to update it for the 21st century.

It is not the critic who counts; not the person who points out how the strong stumble or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the one who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions; who spends himself or herself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he or she fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his or her place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

At this point I call on my colleagues my fellow experts to stand up and applaud the men and women of the DOH the men and women in the arena for their service to the country.

Thank you for listening. – Rappler.com

Previous Or Current Elected Or Appointed Office: No former public office Why are you seeking to run for Congress?

The issues I’m talking about can’t be effectively rectified at the local or state level. Sure we can use the tools we have at the state level to try to mitigate our healthcare problems but these are just Band-Aids that neglect the root causes of our problems. For example states can expand their Medicaid program to increase the number of insured residents. New Jersey has done this. Despite this expansion New Jersey is among the states with the fewest doctors even accepting Medicaid patients (NJ FamilyCare) – “You have a card saying you have health insurance but if no doctors take it it’s almost like having one of those fake IDs.” The same is true for climate mitigation. Despite New Jersey “leading the country in offshore wind” and taking climate mitigation seriously our state is the quickest warming state in the country. We're not unaffected by the neglect of other states. Fighting climate change requires a federal war-time effort. If we are to advocate for these issues we’re compelled to look at the record of our federal representative – the person with the capacity to influence these policies. The health care and climate advancements we seek are undermined by our federal representative. Donald Norcross was the only leadership member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus not supporting House Resolution 1976 – a single-payer universal healthcare system that Yale University Harvard University and the Congressional Budget Office suggest would save hundreds of billions of dollars a year and tens of thousands of lives. On climate he was one of the only House Democrats who supported the Keystone XL Pipeline – energy described as the most destructive on the planet by National Geographic. He also celebrates the Covanta Incinerator in Camden New Jersey – the largest polluter in the county and the second-largest emitter of lead in America. He accepts campaign contributions from the private insurance industry ExxonMobil and the Covanta Incinerator. If our current representative wasn't undermining our progress on universal healthcare and climate mitigation there'd be no reason for my primary challenge. This isn’t about career advancement; it’s about realizing we don’t have the luxury of time to wait for our representatives to do what’s right.

What is the most important issue in your district and how do you intend to address it? Campaign Finance Reform: No matter what our policy priorities are removing private money from the political process is a prerequisite. Our electoral system has been tainted by the overwhelming influence money plays in determining which candidates are elected and how they legislate once in office. It’s a cycle that undermines our progress: corporations fund their preferred candidates and those candidates legislate on behalf of the corporation’s interest. This isn’t speculative. The ExxonMobil Political Action Committee for example is explicit in describing how they determine to which candidates they donate: “Before giving to any political candidate [we have] a robust process to assess the candidate’s platform prior voting record and consistency with the company’s priorities.” Needless to say efforts to decarbonize the planet and electrify our energy sources are at odds with ExxonMobil’s priorities. Their unrestricted ability to fund candidates to maintain their interests severely undermines our chances of effectively mitigating a climate catastrophe. How can we trust our representatives are working for our interests while also accepting money from corporations whose interests are often at odds with our own? To end this perpetual cycle I support a public campaign finance system which rectifies the damage our democracy has incurred due to Citizens United – corporations are not people.

Health Care: Despite the improved coverage accomplished by the Affordable Care Act 30 million Americans uninsured and 44 million underinsured – these are patients with premiums deductibles and co-pays so high that they cannot afford to even use their insurance. What good is having health insurance if it’s too expensive to use? Our current for-profit health care system results in inexcusable failures and immoral tragedies: diagnoses of the four most common types of cancer in the United States spike at age 65. This is because uninsured and underinsured patients become eligible for Medicare at age 65 and can finally see a doctor. There are over 250000 fundraisers on GoFundMe each year to benefit patients who cannot afford their treatments. Medical debt is the leading cause of bankruptcy and patients have died avoiding necessary treatments after losing their health coverage. These tragedies are not isolated; in fact in 2019 34 million Americans reported knowing someone who died because of not receiving medical care. Some suggest we can improve our health care system by expanding Medicaid. While such suggestions are made with the best intent Medicaid expansion does not rectify the problems we face. Our state for example has generously expanded Medicaid benefits; despite this expansion New Jersey is among states with fewest doctors even accepting Medicaid. Others suggest we should increase our federal health care investments. This solution neglects the reality that a considerable portion of our health care expenditures we’ve made isn’t even going towards healthcare: “Although [the Affordable Care Act] expanded coverage…the new public dollars it offered were funneled through private insurers whose exorbitant overhead and profits drain funds before they reach the clinic.” In 2017 health care administrative costs totaled $812 billion – 25% of our national health care expenditures. For context in the same year the Medicare public K-12 education and defense budgets were cheaper than healthcare administration.

Health care is also a women’s rights issue: “health insurance has been…a common reason for…staying married when one would rather not.” The prospects of a divorce disproportionately burdens women: “Ultimately divorce leaves some 65000 women uninsured each year with men being far more likely to maintain coverage after their marriages dissolve.” What if women didn’t have to choose between staying married and health care? It's an issue which has even undermined our local property taxes and school resources. Last March the school district for which I work passed a resolution citing the rising costs of health insurance as a burden which has the potential to lead to program and staff cuts: “Many [school districts] are experiencing...an increase in their health care costs which may result in cuts to critical programs services and staff in order to balance their budgets.” Several other schools in our Congressional district passed this resolution as well. If we are the party that believes in science and research we are compelled to support a single-payer universal healthcare program. The Lancet among the world’s most prestigious medical journals suggests a single-payer system has the potential to save $450 billion and 68000 lives annually and is the quickest way to rectify health care inequities. The Congressional Budget Office and even a Koch brothers-funded study also support these savings. With many patients in one fund we have the leverage to negotiate cheaper health care costs. This is how Medicare patients pay far less for comparable services. For example Medicare patients seeking a musculoskeletal system/connective tissue biopsy at Cooper University Hospital are charged $25257.76 while private insurance patients seeking the same treatment at the same hospital will be charged $109125.00 $125514.96 or $134480.31 depending on their plan. These savings are common. Even providers are grieving their experiences with private insurance companies: “Most of my colleagues wanted to be doctors because they had a strong desire to help heal the sick…. They now spend more time reading procedural rules and entering routine data than diagnosing illness or comforting patients.” The American College of Physicians estimates doctors spend two hours on administrative work per each hour spent with patients. Increasing a significant amount of patient care time a single-payer system relieves this burden and facilitates the increase of per-physician revenue by between $39816 and $158412 annually. These are two of the many reasons the American College of Physicians the second-largest doctors’ group in the country endorsed a single-payer universal health care plan.

There was a point at which every other developed country chose to guarantee the health of its people. I refuse to believe it should take any greater tragedy than the past two years to join the rest of the civilized world and guarantee health care as a human right. What other issues do you feel must be tackled in your district? Environment: I spend a lot of my time in Camden New Jersey. The number of times I’m greeted with a “No Smoking – Oxygen in Use” sign on the front door is sobering. Asthma-related hospitalizations in Camden are among the highest in the state. Camden is also burdened by the Covanta Incinerator the largest polluter in Camden County and the second-largest polluter of lead in the entire country the side effects from which have been identified as asthma irritants. The NAACP highlights the ways in which communities of color are disproportionately burdened by such polluters: “Toxic facilities like coal-fired power plants and incinerators emit mercury arsenic lead and other contaminants into the water food and lungs of communities…. Race – even more than class – is the number one indicator for the placement of toxic facilities.” While accepting their campaign contributions Donald Norcross celebrates Covanta's ""clean renewable energy."" Voter suppression/voting rights:

We often think of voter suppression as a red state issue but New Jersey is just as guilty; we’re just more covert about it. Our primary election ballot is the subject of a lawsuit for the ways its design affords candidates awarded “the line” an average advantage of 30%. This is quantitative research published by Rutgers University. If we believe in democracy we must challenge any systems that undermine democracy – that includes our primary ballot design. “Divide a vertical line in two equal parts by bisecting it with a curved horizontal line that is only straight at its spot bisection of the vertical.” This prompt was from the Louisiana Literacy Test – a prerequisite test given to some voters. If voters couldn’t pass they couldn’t vote. This was one of many absurd measures meant to prevent Black voters from successfully voting. Voting only takes seconds but gaining the right to vote took decades. While racism under Jim Crow laws was explicit voting rights suppression has become implicit packaged under the guise of voting security. There are two bills in Congress that protect the right to vote – The For the People Act and The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. Under these bills voter registration would be automatic early voting would be expanded and voting would be more accessible. Gerrymandering and voter roll purging would be effectively eliminated. As a voting rights and healthcare activist I joined 50000 organizers with Martin Luther King III and Reverend Al Sharpton to call on Congress to lift the filibuster and pass these bills. What sets you apart from the other candidates?

One of the big-ticket items in the most recent federal budget was the new NDP-approved dental care program. Since oral health falls under provincial jurisdiction the announcement raises several questions as to the application of this program across the country.

Expanding access to dental care is a goal we can all get behind especially when we consider that nearly 20 per cent of Canadians see cost as a barrier in this area. But the situation will not improve if the funds are used inefficiently. Certain guidelines if followed would increase the chances of achieving the best possible outcome.

First for the sake of the health of our public finances if the federal government is to introduce a permanent spending program like this it must also cut its expenditures elsewhere by at least an equivalent amount. Failing to consider the extra strain such a program will impose on already heavily taxed Canadian families is irresponsible.

Moreover the federal government must let the provinces organize the delivery of dental care and the distribution of funds. Not only is health care a provincial responsibility but the provinces are in the best position to answer the needs of their population and adjust the program as those needs change over time. In other words the dental care program must not take away the provinces’ ability to innovate in elaborating their public policies just because the financing comes from the federal government.

And speaking of elaboration the dental care program should be modelled after Quebec’s current drug insurance plan. Specifically this means having the government cover the cost or part of the cost of select dental services for those who do not already have dental insurance. Indeed those who already have a good dental coverage plan as many Canadians do often through their employer should not be forced to abandon it in favour of a government-run plan. This way just as for prescription drugs the province’s entire population would have dental insurance without limiting choice.

Including dentists and dental hygienists in the elaboration of the government-run program could also ensure that it is well-adapted to the realities of their profession. Surely maintaining their professional autonomy is of the utmost importance.

It is worth mentioning that improving the accessibility of dental care can be achieved without increased spending. Introducing public policies that instead increase efficiency can also lead to greater access to health services.

A concrete example of such a policy is the autonomy that was finally granted to dental hygienists in Quebec in 2020 to allow them to work within their own clinics without the supervision of a dentist. Quebec was one of the last provinces in the country to do so with Prince Edward Island alone now still prohibiting independent practice for these professionals. Entrepreneurship has therefore been encouraged across the country likely reducing the cost of routine cleaning and thereby improving access to preventive treatments.

Achieving more with the immense amount of money we already spend on our provincial health care systems needs to be explored before resorting to increased spending. Other countries such as the United Kingdom can serve as models as they have less costly universal health care systems that offer greater dental coverage than Canadian provinces currently do.

At the end of the day we must avoid nationalizing dental care and instead provide coverage for those who can’t afford it. Creating a government-run monopoly would lead to the same problems we see elsewhere in our health care systems – long wait lists shortages an overabundance of bureaucracy – none of which will help improve the accessibility of this important service.

I point to two critical challenges which can gain so much from a well-structured and implemented public-private partnerships (PPPs) environment:

1.) Boosting healthcare: Significantly adding healthcare capacity should be a top priority. We need both “beds” and “heads” — hospitals and healthcare practitioners — if we truly want to future-proof our healthcare system. With around 100000 beds our bed-to-population ratio of 1.0 remains under the World Health Organization (WHO) standard of 3.0. To reach a ratio of at least 1.25 by 2025 the country needs to increase its capacity by at least 54000 beds. This is a massive undertaking that government cannot do alone. If we want to increase hospital bed capacity we need to attract more private sector investments through incentives and other mechanisms such as PPP arrangements so we can entice more private players to be involved.

However the other half of the challenge is the glaring gap in the country’s pool of doctors nurses and allied professionals. For example we have around 0.4 doctors per 1000 population well below the WHO-prescribed standard of 1:1000. The next generation should be encouraged to pursue training in healthcare-related fields. The government should explore incentivizing universities and medical schools to lower tuition costs and increase class sizes. PPPs can also be harnessed to establish more medical schools and training facilities further empowering Filipinos all over to take on the call of service as healthcare providers.

Part and parcel to the government’s plan of strengthening Philippine healthcare is the implementation of Universal Health Care (UHC). Private healthcare providers should be encouraged and incentivized to establish primary healthcare facilities in coordination with LGUs to support the roll out of UHC. Furthermore as the private sector continues to innovate with new mechanisms in line with UHC the government should also be flexible in its regulations able to adapt and evolve with these new business models. The private sector is eager to support UHC and like how we dealt with the pandemic cooperation and collaboration with the government are key if we want to see UHC through.

Finally PhilHealth plays a vital role. To ensure PhilHealth’s future success and build resilience in the healthcare system against the future unpredictability with the pandemic there are clear opportunities that should be addressed now particularly on improving technology and systems for claims processing fraud detection and collections and reimbursements. The private sector can help by lending its collective wealth of technical knowledge and experience with global best practices. Should PhilHealth need to outsource certain functions or consult on what are the best strategies as it reforms the private sector is readily available to help and provide support where needed.

2.) Addressing our learning crisis: The pandemic has aggravated a Learning Crisis that has been creeping upon us for decades but has been highlighted in recent years with our dismal placings in several international assessments of learner competencies and most recently with the World Bank’s staggering data showing us at the bottom of the heap in almost all categories. Using data from PISA TIMSS and SEA-PLM (Program for International Student Assessment Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study and Southeast Asia Primary Learning Metrics) the World Bank (2021) estimates that 90% of 10-year-olds cannot read a simple story.

There are three areas with great opportunities for a strong Public Private Partnership to make a difference:

A. Improving the voucher system to accelerate school opening and learning recovery: The government has been successfully running large scale education subsidy programs in high school. In SY 2021-22 about a million private junior high students are ESC grantees while in senior high about a million students are voucher recipients.

The positive impact is clear cut. In August 2020 an ADB study concluded that the programs promote the efficiency of the mixed public-private education system enable greater choice empower the parents and the learners and promote diversity of providers.

But there is much more potential to expand and refine these programs such as (1.) increasing high school slots; (2.) redesigning programs towards the adoption of a universal voucher across eligible grade levels; (3.) adding grades 1-6; (4.) differentiating the grant amount using parameters such as socio-economic status school location SHS tracks or strands; (5.) quality assuring all participating schools and (6.) prioritizing disadvantaged students such as children with disabilities and indigenous peoples.

In higher education the government is spending massively by subsidizing state colleges and universities offering free tuition for all. As has been pointed out by the Philippine Institute for Development Studies (PIDS) the government’s think tank this is sub optimal: there is not enough financial support for the truly needy students (tuition is only a portion of the cost) leakages to the non-poor and inimical effects on private institutions many of which are much more efficient in providing education than their public counterparts. To address these shortcomings a PPP model wherein a portable voucher is provided exclusively to the poor that would allow them to enroll in the post-senior high school of their choice whether public or private can be adopted. This is more efficient in using taxpayer money and by empowering students to choose provides a market test of the quality of public provision.

Additionally vouchers need not be limited to college but can also be deployed for other post-senior high school training programs more attuned to the needs of our country e.g. digital skills.

B. Improving digital connectivity and 21st century teaching and learning: Improved availability of good digital connectivity in urban centers has partially addressed the inability to do face to face classes in the last two years. However this has widened the digital divide in terms of access to remote education platforms.

A possible PPP solution to this would be for the government to tap the technological and management expertise of telcos to expand their reach into those areas. Financially supporting their infrastructure and facilities roll out in areas that would not otherwise be commercially viable and providing subsidies to poor users using for example the CCT (conditional cash transfer) mechanisms would help solve this pressing problem.

But technology alone cannot solve the learning crisis. Guidance by trained and well-supported teachers is also needed for students to maximize the benefits of digital connectivity.

C. Education Commission 2: If Education Commission 2 is passed into law it would be a golden opportunity for the public and private sectors to work together to reboot our educational systems.

Ideally the reboot should be informed by a holistic data-driven assessment led by PIDS the government’s think tank. Its review should cover legislative policy and administrative gaps including the assessment of budgetary requirements to support public and private education sectors equally. The private sector could take the lead in providing technical assistance for a truly reimagined education system focused on improved learning for all.

Healthcare and education are just two areas that can flourish and create meaningful social impact through PPPs that are designed properly and implemented under the right enabling environment. I remain steadfast in my belief that there is a golden opportunity for us to build on the trust and collaboration gains created between government and the private sector during our collective response to COVID’s challenges and channel these towards structured well-designed and longer-term contractual PPPs.

However unlike the partnerships done during the pandemic — which are one-shot endeavors — contractual PPPs typically require long-term commitments including significant capital from proponents and financiers. Thus given the complex nature of such arrangements such contractual PPPs need to be commercially viable sustainable and predictable.

Allow me to provide some recommendations to ensure that such a vibrant environment for contractual PPPs will emerge:

1. Institutionalize Public-Private dialogues for each of the government’s priority sectors and supplement these with a Steering Committee Secretariat and regular cadence. While these may sound mundane a continuous series of regular monthly dialogues with clear accountabilities and next steps will be much more effective than the current approach of ad hoc and irregular meetings when crises arise. The T3 (Task Force T3 [Test Trace Treat]) experience validates this arrangement.

2. Place the spirit of partnership and collaboration at the center of joint initiatives. Partners should recognize the strength of the private sector and the limitations of government and vice versa and seek to bridge these gaps through cooperation. We note that the government has had difficulty in the building and operation of projects especially those that are complex and require high levels of technical expertise (e.g. IT projects massive infrastructure initiatives etc.). The private sector can certainly fill in these gaps but under the appropriate environment of trust and genuine partnership.

3. Respect the basic principle of risk allocation. Parties that can best manage particular risks should be the primary ones to carry these. Thus on the issue of Material Adverse Government Action (MAGA) such risks should not and cannot be borne by the private sector as this may result in unviable projects that do not generate interested qualified bidders.

4. Respect the sanctity of contracts. Business thrives in an environment of predictability and consistency with internationally recognized mechanisms existing to resolve disputes between parties. Robust PPP arrangements would greatly benefit from this environment of respect for private partners their contracts and the decisions of international arbiters in cases of disputes.

5. Design globally competitive PPP contracts. Connected to the above arrangements that are investment-friendly attract the highest quality local and global players that can best meet the requirements of government and the public at the least cost while promoting healthy competition. The amendments to the Public Services Act that allows 100% foreign ownership in key infrastructure projects are a step in the right direction. However the proposed amendments to the BOT (build operate transfer) Law’s Implementing Rules covering exclusions to what constitutes MAGA uncertainty in determining “reasonable” rates and returns and removing arbitration as a dispute-settlement mechanism among others are a worrying development.

To close the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have ushered in unprecedented levels of trust and a much tighter partnership within the private sector and between the private sector and the government — the bayanihan spirit coming to life. I believe that there is no other more opportune time than this post-pandemic period to build on these gains and create an environment where public-private partnerships broadly defined become a critical vehicle for addressing our several development challenges in the delivery of needed public services and infrastructure both hard and soft. The government’s limited fiscal resources at this time require that it spend these more wisely and leverage the same with private financial resources and technical and management know-how.

Es optimista por las ventas alcanzadas en las últimas semanas especialmente a Estados Unidos.

El sector ha experimentado un crecimiento sostenido durante los últimos dos años a pesar de la contracción generada en el mercado internacional al inicio de la pandemia por el COVID-19.

“El año anterior durante toda la temporada de madres logramos exportar 16 millones de tallos y este año logramos una meta de 17.7 millones de tallos” señala Rubén Orozco director general Utopia Farms

Explica que la actividad en el sector ha sido afectada por el incremento del precio del petróleo los fletes y fertilizantes lo que ha incidido en los costos de producción. Además en el caso de los floricultores ecuatorianos también afectó la invasión rusa a Ucrania porque alrededor del 40% de la producción local se destina a Europa.

“Ucrania se transformó en ventas cero (…) Si bien las ventas no son directo a Rusia se han abierto otros canales a través de Polonia y Bielorrusia” afirma Orozco.

En materia local también se advierte una reactivación del mercado de flores. Así lo dice Byron Heredia dueño de una pequeña finca localizada a unos 40 minutos de Quito.

""El Valentín americano el Día de la Mujer Rusia estuvo bien (…) Ahora bien lo de Madre pasamos una temporada bastante aceptable rentable”)). dijo Heredia.

Según la Federación de Exportadores de Flores en 2021 se estableció un récord en exportaciones alcanzando alrededor de 927 millones de dólares que superó a la cifra de 2020 que fue de 827 millones de dólares.

The best Verizon prepaid phones:

Editor’s note: We’ll be updating this list of the best Verizon prepaid phones regularly as new devices launch.

1. Samsung Galaxy S22 series

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

Samsung kickstarts every year with its most popular smartphone line-up and 2022 was no exception. Samsung’s flagship trifecta was announced at its Unpacked event revealing a trio of what are all but guaranteed to be among the most popular handsets for a while. These are the Samsung Galaxy S22 S22 Plus and S22 Ultra. More: These are the best Samsung phones currently available

The base Samsung Galaxy S22 is the most affordable of the three followed by the S22 Plus and the priciest one is the Galaxy S22 Ultra. Aside from the display and reduced battery sizes though differences between the former are kept to a minimum which means the experience should be very similar across the board. In fact it’s tough to tell either the Galaxy S22 or S22 Plus apart from its S21 predecessor.

The S22 Ultra is the one that stands out the most thanks to its more impressive camera setup and S Pen support. It looks closer to a Galaxy Note 20 successor than a standard S-series flagship. However all come with an impressive Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and all the high-end specs you’ve come to expect from a modern flagship handset.

Eric Zeman / Android Authority Samsung Galaxy S21 FE

The Samsung Galaxy S series may be more popular but it’s easier than ever to get flagship specs in a more affordable package. Samsung’s Galaxy S21 FE might not be the same hit its predecessor was but it makes for a great value from Verizon. Read next: The Galaxy S21 FE buyer’s guide

The Galaxy S21 FE lands right in the middle of the vanilla Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus. It packs a 6.4-inch display with a Gorilla Glass Victus front and a plastic rear panel yet it still offers 15W wireless charging. Samsung tapped the 2021 flagship Snapdragon 888 processor to keep the lights on as well as up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.

It feels more premium in hand thanks to its metal frame. The rear panel of the Galaxy S21 FE comes in four clean colors: white Graphite Olive and Lavender. You should have no problems with the 4500mAh battery and 25W wired charging will have you back on the go quickly. This is still among the best Verizon prepaid phones so go get it!

3. iPhone 13 series

Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority

No matter how much we love Android it’s tough to deny that the iPhone 13 and its siblings are some of the best phones you can get right now. From the powerful A15 Bionic chipsets to the clever camera array there’s a lot to like coming out of Cupertino. Sure you’ll pay the Apple tax but these are some of the best Verizon prepaid phones you can find. See also: Apple iPhone 13 buyer’s guide

Apple’s flagship line has stayed at four devices for the second year in a row — improving on the flaws of the previous 5.4-inch iPhone 12 Mini. It matches the rest in terms of CPU and a pair of 12MP shooters but Apple gave the battery a boost in hopes of it lasting a bit longer. You’ll find a glossy glass finish on both the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini though the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max opt for a frosted glass finish and they jump to 6GB of RAM.

Overall the blend of hardware and software makes Apple’s iPhone 13 line the best yet.

4. Google Pixel 6 series

Robert Triggs / Android Authority

Google flipped the script last year by offering a midrange Pixel 5. Now it’s firmly back in the flagship camp with its latest Pixel 6 series. Not only that but Google found a way to push high-end specs without the premium price tag. Both the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro pack plenty of updates and they more than justify the cost.

For starters Google ditched Qualcomm for its latest devices. Instead you’ll find a Google Tensor chip at home on both models. This allows for better use of Google’s machine learning and image processing as well as longer future updates. You can choose between the 6.4-inch Pixel 6 and the 6.7-inch Pixel 6 Pro along with a solid set of colors. Related: Google Pixel 6 buyer’s guide

Google’s other key change is in the camera department. It’s impossible to miss the hefty camera bar across the rear Gorilla Glass Victus panel. Said camera bar packs an all-new 50MP primary lens backed up by a 12MP ultra-wide option. If you go for the Pixel 6 Pro you get a 48MP telephoto lens to boot good for up to 4x optical zoom.

Google Pixel 6 specs:

Display: 6.4-inch Full HD+

6.4-inch Full HD+ SoC: Tensor

Tensor RAM: 8GB

8GB Storage: 128/256GB Cameras: 50 and 12MP

5. Motorola One 5G Ace

Adam Molina / Android Authority

If you’re in the market for a mid-range smartphone Motorola should find its way towards the top of your list. It’s a leader when it comes to budget-friendly devices and you have a whole host of options to choose from. See also: Motorola One 5G Ace review

The One 5G Ace handset packs the Snapdragon 750G chipset under the hood and 4GB of RAM with 64GB of storage. There’s also the old-fashioned headphone jack onboard. Motorola’s triple camera setup is another important feature capped off by a 48MP main lens. The 8MP ultra-wide camera and 2MP macro shooter offer extra flexibility even if they’re not the sharpest around.

You should have no problem bingeing the day away on the large 6.7-inch Full HD display and a water-repellent coating can offer at least a little bit of peace of mind. There’s no real IP rating but that doesn’t stop the One 5G Ace from landing among the best Verizon prepaid phones.

Motorola One 5G Ace specs:

Display: 6.7-inch Full HD+

6.7-inch Full HD+ SoC: Snapdragon 750G

Snapdragon 750G RAM: 4GB

6. Samsung Galaxy A53 5G

Ryan Haines / Android Authority

The Samsung Galaxy A53 5G is a great alternative on the Verizon prepaid phones list for those not looking to splash out on a flagship device. The A53 comes with a four-lens camera array that impresses a large OLED display and an Infinity-O display. Also: These are the best cheap phones available

It’s equipped with Samsung’s in-house Exynos 1280 SoC and packs 128 or 256GB of storage space for all of your favorite apps and photos. Samsung opted for a plastic construction for its Galaxy A53 but it feels premium in hand thanks to the metal frame.

Samsung Galaxy A53 5G specs:

Display: 6.5-inch FHD+

6.5-inch FHD+ Chipset: Exynos 1280

5000mAh Software: Android 12

7. TCL 10 5G

Eric Zeman / Android Authority

The TCL 10 5G is no powerhouse but it’s one of the best Verizon prepaid phones for affordable 5G. For starters the price is just $299.99 with a special promo code right now. Add the fact that you get a triple camera experience with a 16MP selfie lens on the front and you have a solid all-around performer. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 765G is the beating heart of the operation and 6GB of RAM help to round things out.

You’re also looking at a 6.53-inch Full HD+ display and a headphone jack for some added media enjoyment.

8. Apple iPhone SE (2022)

Ryan Haines / Android Authority

Budget premium phones are all the hype these days with the Pixel 6a and iPhone SE offering amazing quality at very accessible price points. The iPhone SE is easily one of the best Verizon prepaid phones and one of the best Apple handsets on a budget. More: iPhone buying guide

The iPhone SE offers the Apple promise at about $430. It includes the familiar glass and metal design we saw on the iPhone 8 and has a very competitive camera even if there’s only one lens. Users will also love that Apple didn’t skimp out on the processor as the iPhone SE uses the same Apple A15 Bionic processor we see in iPhone 13 handsets. Other benefits include wireless charging and an IP67 rating two features that have become popular in the budget realm.

Apple iPhone SE (2022) specs:

Display: 4.7-inch 1334 x 750

However budgets are tighter than usual this year. So Verizon is making it somewhat more affordable to treat mom with a Mother's Day gift she's bound to love.

Currently at Verizon you can get an iPhone 13 for free when you trade-in your old device and open a new line with unlimited data. That's one of the best iPhone 13 deals we've seen. If you don't have an old phone to trade in Verizon is also offering a free iPhone SE 2022 when you open a new line with select unlimited data plan. Remember you can opt to buy these online and pickup in-store.

iPhone 13: free w/ trade-in + unlimited @ Verizon

Get mom one of the best phones on the market. For a limited time at Verizon you can get a free iPhone 13 when you trade-in your old device and open a new unlimited line. Plus you'll get an additional $200 if you switch from a competing carrier. Make sure you check our Verizon promo codes for the latest discounts.

iPhone SE 2022: free w/ unlimited + new line @ Verizon

Don't have an old or damaged phone to trade in? New and existing members can get a new iPhone SE 2022 for free when you open a new unlimited line. That's $429 off and one of the best deals we've seen from Verizon. No trade-in is required for this deal.

The iPhone 13 is one of the best phones you can buy. Naturally it comes with a high price tag. The base iPhone 13 costs $799 whereas the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max cost $999 and $1099 respectively. Meanwhile the iPhone 13 mini is the smallest and least-expensive model in the lineup coming in at $699.

In our iPhone 13 review we called the Editor's Choice phone the best iPhone for most people. We like that Apple has finally bumped the base model's storage to 128GB so you don't have to jump to the next storage tier just to fit everything on your phone. The A15 processor — the same one found in the iPhone 13 Pro models — continues to set the pace for mobile processors allowing the iPhone 13 to outperform any Android device.

However the real story is the cameras. The iPhone 13 still features two rear lenses but they have bigger sensors which translates to improved low-light photography. What’s more Apple includes a number of computational-powered features like Cinematic mode to automatically shift focus when you’re shooting video.

Alternatively the iPhone SE 2022 is the perfect phone for any mom. In our iPhone SE 2022 review we called the new phone the fastest phone you can buy for under $500. It's very similar to its predecessor. The main difference is the addition of a new A15 Bionic CPU which is the same chip found in the iPhone 13 lineup. The new CPU brings better battery life (up to 15 hours vs. up to 13 hours) and advanced camera features like Photographic Styles and Deep Fusion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdldGRyb2lkdGlwcy5jb20vbW90b3JvbGEtZWRnZS14MzAtZmlybXdhcmUtZmxhc2gtZmlsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Motorola Edge X30 Firmware Flash File | Downgrade Unbrick,"On this page we have shared the download link and guide to install the Motorola Edge X30 (hiphi) firmware flash file using the ADB Fastboot method.

Caesars Entertainment spinoff VICI Properties said April 29 that it completed its $17.2 billion buyout of MGM Growth Properties the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. The deal was first announced last August and included the assumption of about $5.7 billion of debt.

As part of the sale VICI acquired several MGM Resorts-operated properties along Las Vegas Boulevard including Mandalay Bay MGM Grand The Mirage Park MGM New York-New York Luxor and Excalibur.

It also picked up several other casino properties outside Nevada including MGM Grand Detroit and MGM National Harbor near Washington D.C.

All told VICI is slated to receive more than $1 billion in initial annual rent from the newly acquired properties the firm indicated.

The buyout likely won’t result in noticeable changes at the resorts anytime soon as VICI does not operate the properties but rather collects rent from the companies that do.

Still it easily ranks among the largest real estate sales the Strip has ever seen and significantly expands VICI’s holdings in the famed casino corridor making the New York company one of the biggest property owners on Las Vegas Boulevard.

VICI now owns 10 resorts on the Strip totaling almost 41000 hotel rooms 1.2 million square feet of casino space and 5.9 million square feet of meeting and convention space company President and Chief Operating Officer John Payne said in a news release.

Company CEO Ed Pitoniak said the deal makes VICI the largest owner of hotel and conference real estate in America.

MGM Resorts which spun off MGM Growth in 2016 and was its controlling shareholder received about $4.4 billion in cash as part of the VICI buyout according to a company news release.

Operations at MGM Resorts-run properties now owned by VICI ""will continue as before for guests and employees"" MGM spokesman Brian Ahern told the Review-Journal.

MGM will use proceeds from the deal to invest in its ""core business"" President and CEO Bill Hornbuckle said in a May 2 earnings call adding the company would also ""continue to seek meaningful growth opportunities.""

MGM announced it is offering $607 million to buy LeoVegas a Swedish online gaming firm. It also is in the process of buying the operations side of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas for more than $1.6 billion; will begin spending on a new resort in Osaka Japan later this year; and plans to build a 1000-room resort in the United Arab Emirates.

VICI was spun off from Caesars Entertainment in 2017 as the casino chain’s main operating unit emerged from bankruptcy. By the end of that year VICI’s real estate holdings on the Strip consisted of Caesars Palace and Harrah’s a securities filing shows.

In the not-too-distant past Las Vegas Boulevard was an eerily quiet ghost town.

Casinos were under state-ordered lockdown over the coronavirus outbreak and tourism Southern Nevada’s main financial engine had largely ground to a halt.

Today? The Strip is jammed with people again casinos are raking in mountains of cash — and real estate activity in the corridor is gaining momentum.

Over the past year or so Las Vegas has seen a rising tally of sales and construction plans involving vacant land retail properties and hotels on or near the Strip.

In the latest transaction the company behind Formula One said Friday it is buying 39 acres east of the Strip for $240 million. It did not provide long-term plans for the site but outlined the purchase after F1 announced in late March it will hold a race on the Strip next year.

America’s gambling capital is no stranger to high-priced real estate deals and while Las Vegas is filled with massive hotels and other over-the-top projects it also has a long history of developers pitching big plans and never following through.

But real estate deals seem to be picking up around Las Vegas Boulevard as tourism bounces back from the catastrophic drop-off of 2020.

Houston billionaire Tilman Fertitta for instance is in the process of acquiring around 6 acres on the Strip for more than $200 million with plans to build an upscale hotel people familiar with the matter recently told the Review-Journal.

Las Vegas real estate firm The Siegel Group purchased roughly 10 acres on and near the north Strip for $75 million last month and is eyeing a project that could include a hotel-casino condo units and retail.

Also live-entertainment firm Oak View Group announced plans in late March for an estimated $3 billion complex south of the Strip with an arena hotel-casino and amphitheater and Hard Rock International said in December that it’s buying The Mirage’s operations for more than $1 billion in cash and aims to build a guitar-shaped hotel tower on the Strip.

Other deals announced last year have pushed ahead as well. Among them: Casino landlord Vici Properties completed its $17.2 billion buyout of MGM Resorts International’s real estate spinoff last week giving the buyer several more hotel properties on the Strip.

Vici now owns 660 acres along the corridor and according to CEO Ed Pitoniak has become “the leading real estate owner” on what “we believe is the most economically productive street in the world the Las Vegas Strip.”

With all this cash flowing around some might think back to the go-go days of the mid-2000s when easy money inflated the real estate market until of course it burst and the broader economy collapsed.

Back then Las Vegas was ground zero for America’s real estate boom and bust and the Strip was by no means spared the financial carnage as big projects were halted and property values plunged.

More than a few people contend the U.S. economy is currently overheated though for now there’s no way to tell what direction it will go let alone how or if it would affect real estate on the Strip.

But with visitors streaming back to Las Vegas developers and others in this highly lucrative and ultra-competitive tourism market are doing what often just seems normal here: buying and building big real estate.

Arlana Miller a first-year student from Texas was announced dead by university authorities on Thursday raising concern about the mounting pressure on student athletes in the United States.

""Our entire campus community is deeply saddened by the untimely death of Arlana Miller a freshman who was majoring in agriculture on the Baton Rouge campus” the university said in a statement on Facebook.

The university did not share the cause of her death but the athletic department confirmed she died after putting up a post on social media.

It added that on 4 May at approximately 9pm local time the athletic department was informed about a social media post ""which ultimately led to this unfortunate announcement"".

In her final post on Instagram Millar wrote about her mental health struggles and history of suicidal thoughts. She wrote about her sufferings in this past year alone with Covid-19 tearing her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and failing school.

The post has since been deleted from the platform however screenshots of her message continue to make rounds.

""She was extremely dedicated to her sport a tremendously hard worker and a warm and engaging young woman. She will be missed. Our thoughts are with her family; her teammates and friends"" he said in a statement.

Miller's death highlights the plight of student-athletes bound by tremendous pressure to perform on the field and academically. Since March 2022 three students have reportedly died by suicide across the country.

Katie Meyer the 22-year-old captain of the Stanford University women's football team was found dead in her dorm. Sarah Shulze 21 a star runner at the University of Wisconsin-Madison died by suicide in April.

Days later Lauren Bernett a 20-year-old softball player at James Madison University was found dead.

I have heard of the UAE’s long-term residency called Golden Visa. Can you explain the scheme to me? Who can apply and what are its benefits?

Pursuant to your queries it should be noted that the UAE Cabinet Resolution No. 56 of 2018 allows a foreign national to obtain long-term residency (Golden Visa) in the UAE. Multiple categories of residents can apply for the residency.

An individual is eligible to apply for a 10-year Golden Visa without a sponsor if his or her investments in the UAE are at least Dh2 million. These may be in the form of investment funds accredited in the UAE; or a commercial or industrial licence of an investor where the memorandum of association of their legal entity mentions the paid-up capital of the said company is not less than Dh2 million; or the investor is the owner of a company in the UAE and pays tax of not less than Dh250000 annually to the Federal Tax Authority. Under these categories the investor may also include his or her spouse and dependents while applying for the Golden Visa.

Senior employees such as executive director or an advisor appointed by an investor in public investments may be entitled to apply for a Golden Visa without a sponsor.

Any individual who owns properties worth Dh2 million or more in the UAE is eligible to apply for a five-year Golden Visa. Under these categories the properties should not have any loan on them. However the investors whose properties are on loan may be eligible for the visa provided that at least Dh2 million of the value of the properties are their own equity.

Individuals who do not fall under the investors or businessmen eligibility criteria may apply if they are a retired foreigner who are at least 55 years old and have Dh1 million investment or an income of Dh15000 per month.

Individuals who are researchers in the fields of science and knowledge such as doctors specialists scientists inventors as well as creative individuals in the field of culture and art may apply as well.

The specialised talented individuals may be granted a 10-year Golden Visa.

Further outstanding students studying in recognised schools and universities inside or outside the UAE may apply for the long-term residency visas.

If any individual in the UAE falls under the aforesaid categories they can apply for the Golden Visa through the website of the Federal Authority for Identity Citizenship Customs and Port Security (ICP).

Benefits

- 10 years of renewable residence visa.

- No sponsor or employer required.

- The limitation period to stay outside the UAE does not apply for the visa holders; ie the visa is not cancelled if the holder stays outside the country for more than six months.

- The residence visa is granted to family members of visa holders including spouse and children with no age limit.

- There is no maximum limit to apply for domestic workers’ visas/work permits.

- An entry permit issued to potential visa holders are valid for six months with multiple entries allowed until the visa processing procedures are completed.

- In the event of death of the original holder of the visa the family members may stay in the UAE till the end of their residence permit.

For further clarifications related to this matter you may contact the ICP and the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs.

VMC,Vulcan Materials Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndzd3Mub3JnL2VuL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjIvMDUvMDkvaW93YS1tMDkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Iowa cement truck drivers' strike for higher pay enters second week at King's Ready Mix,"A King's Material cement mixer truck. [Photo: King’s Material]

On Monday May 2 cement truck drivers employed by King’s Ready Mix in Cedar Rapids Iowa began to strike after unanimously rejecting a contract proposal by the company. Somewhere between 16 and 18 drivers are involved in the action according to local press reports and are seeking substantial wage increases to offset inflation and years of stagnating pay.

Workers’ current base pay rate is $22.45 an hour. Teamsters Local 238 has stated it is demanding this be raised to $25.70 but it is not clear how many years a new contract would cover and what annual percentage raise this would represent.

The strike at King’s takes place as part of an international upsurge of strikes protests and working class struggles. Faced with spiraling prices for food gas and other basic necessities growing numbers of workers around the world are seeking higher pay and improved working conditions. In Burlington Iowa and Racine Wisconsin roughly 1200 workers at CNH the global agricultural and construction equipment manufacturer initiated a strike the same day as King’s and are also seeking major improvements to wages and benefits.

King’s driver Jim Hoyt who has worked for the cement mixing company for 25 years told local KCRG reporters that workers rejected one formally written offer and another verbal offer before making the decision to go on strike. “I think all the drivers should be able to afford their rent or mortgage every month take a vacation once a year and right now with the wages we’re currently getting we can’t do that” Hoyt told the station.

King’s Inc. President Charlie Rhode predictably expressed the company’s “disappointment” in the strike claiming in a statement “We have always had a wage-and-fringe benefit package that is fair and equitable to our team and our offers have reflected that.”

Teamsters Local 238 Secretary-Treasurer Jesse Case stated recently that the union is “hopeful for a resolution” adding “It’s important to keep the lines of communication open. We want a deal that’s reasonable to both parties.”

Such language has long been used by the pro-corporate trade unions to force through contracts entirely on the companies’ terms allowing them to drive down wages and shred pensions health benefits and other gains. In 2018 the Teamsters rammed through a sellout contract at UPS which created a new tier of low-paid hybrid driver-warehouse workers despite a majority no vote by workers against the contract.

Founded in 1935 King’s was acquired by US Concrete in 2016 for an undisclosed sum. US Concrete founded in 1997 in Euless Texas is a major national construction company with positions in cities such as Dallas-Fort Worth San Francisco New York City Philadelphia and Washington D.C. among others. In 2021 the reported revenue for the corporation was over $1.3 billion. US Concrete President and CEO Ronnie Pruitt reportedly made over $3.3 million in 2020 with a base salary of over $700000 and an end-of-year bonus of over $1.4 million.

US Concrete’s stock price has skyrocketed over the last two years as the Federal Reserve flooded financial markets with virtually free money massively inflating share prices. At the beginning of the pandemic the company’s stock plummeted to just over $5 per share the lowest since the company went public in 1999. By April 2021 the value had risen to over $78 a share.

In August 2021 US Concrete was acquired by Vulcan Materials a deal valued at $1.3 billion. Vulcan recently reported their first-quarter aggregate sales totaled $1.12 billion an increase of more than 25 percent compared to their 2021 first-quarter sales.

With such large sums being made there is simply no grounds for King’s to claim that it cannot afford to massively raise workers’ wages.

To win their demands workers at King’s must take matters into their own hands and seek to broaden the strike appealing for support throughout the working class including at CNH John Deere the meatpacking plants among teachers and elsewhere.



The mobilization of workers’ collective strength requires a network of rank-and-file committees independent of the pro-corporate unions. On Thursday the newly formed CNH Workers Rank-and-File Committee issued a statement calling for a $10 raise and the restoration of cost-of-living raises and retiree health care among other demands.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zYWxpc2J1cnlwb3N0L25hbWUvcm9iZXJ0LXBvd2VsbC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNDc5NDk4N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert Powell Obituary (2022) - Woodleaf NC - Salisbury Post,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/salisburypost/name/robert-powell-obituary?id=34794987 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9zYWxpc2J1cnlwb3N0L25hbWUvcm9iZXJ0LXBvd2VsbC1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zNDc5NDk4N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

R. Berkley Corporation (NYSE:WRB)?,"A look at the shareholders of W. R. Berkley Corporation (NYSE:WRB) can tell us which group is most powerful. Institutions often own shares in more established companies while it's not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies. Warren Buffett said that he likes ""a business with enduring competitive advantages that is run by able and owner-oriented people."" So it's nice to see some insider ownership because it may suggest that management is owner-oriented.

With a market capitalization of US$18b W. R. Berkley is rather large. We'd expect to see institutional investors on the register. Companies of this size are usually well known to retail investors too. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below) it seems that institutions own shares in the company. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups to learn more about W. R. Berkley.

See our latest analysis for W. R. Berkley

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About W. R. Berkley?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

W. R. Berkley already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see W. R. Berkley's historic earnings and revenue below but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. W. R. Berkley is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data we can see that the largest shareholder is the CEO William Berkley with 19% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile the second and third largest shareholders hold 8.5% and 5.2% of the shares outstanding respectively.

We did some more digging and found that 8 of the top shareholders account for roughly 52% of the register implying that along with larger shareholders there are a few smaller shareholders thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

Insider Ownership Of W. R. Berkley

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business but the CEO will answer to the board even if he or she is a member of it.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

It seems insiders own a significant proportion of W. R. Berkley Corporation. It has a market capitalization of just US$18b and insiders have US$3.8b worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders especially in a company of this size. You can click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public-- including retail investors -- own 11% stake in the company and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Next Steps:

It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand W. R. Berkley better we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 1 warning sign with W. R. Berkley  and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

EGYPT: The cabinet has approved two railway financing packages including an agreement for Export-Import Bank of Korea to provide a loan for signalling modernisation on the 224 km Luxor – Aswan High Dam railway.

Electronic signalling new control systems and the installation of automatic barriers at 70 level crossings is intended to enhance safety and reduce headways to increase passenger and freight capacity while allowing the maximum speed to be raised from 120 to 160 km/h.

In January Egyptian National Railways and Export-Import Bank of Korea signed an agreement for the Korean Economic Development Co-operation Fund to provide US$251·6m soft loan to finance the project.

The cabinet has also approved a draft agreement which would see the European Investment Bank provide a €221m loan for upgrading the 119 km Tanta – Mansura – Damietta line.

Meanwhile the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development has awarded a US$2·5m grant to finance technical economic and environmental feasibility studies for the construction of a 570 km line linking Egypt and Sudan.

The shortage has led retailers including CVS Target and Walgreens to limit purchases of infant formula.

Shortages are even worse in some states: Tennessee Texas Missouri Iowa South Dakota and North Dakota face supply shortages higher than 50%.

The ongoing infant formula shortage isn't over yet – and appears to be getting worse.

Nearly 40% of popular baby formula brands were sold out at retailers across the U.S. during the week starting April 24 according to an analysis by Datasembly which assessed supplies at more than 11000 stores.

That's up from an already-high out-of-stock percentage of 31% two weeks ago Datasembly said.

Major retailers including CVS Target and Walgreens are limiting the amount of formula shoppers can purchase.

Walgreens continues to limit shoppers to three infant and toddler formula products per transaction Walgreens Boots Alliance spokesman Steve Cohen said. ""Due to increased demand and various supplier challenges infant and toddler formulas are seeing constraint across the country"" he said.

The situation is the same at CVS which limits three baby formula products per purchase in its stores and online according to a statement to USA TODAY from CVS Health which owns the pharmacy chain. ""We’re continuing to work with our baby formula vendors to address this issue and we regret any inconvenience this causes our customers"" the statement continued.

Target is also limiting shoppers to up to four formula products at a time the retailer told CBS News.

After recently visiting three different stores in one day last month Elyssa Schmier the vice president of government relations for advocacy group MomsRising""all of a sudden realized my formula was nowhere to be found"" she told USA TODAY. ""It's almost a full-time job trying to find Similac.""

Infant formula recalls worsen situation

Exacerbating the problem has been a voluntary recall Abbott Nutrition issued in mid-February recalling select batches of Similac Alimentum and EleCare formulas made in Sturgis Michigan. That recall was expanded in late February to include one lot of Similac PM 60/40.

Subsequently the Food and Drug Administration in March issued preliminary findings about the formula maker's failure to maintain sanitary conditions and procedures at that plant.

The FDA continues to investigate the situation at Abbott and is ""working with Abbott on safe resumption of production at the Sturgis Michigan facility"" it says in a notice about the recall on its website.

""We are aware the recall has created new concerns about the availability of certain types of infant formula particularly given the overall strains on supply chains experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic"" the FDA said. ""We will continue discussion with Abbott Nutrition and other infant formula manufacturers and consider all tools available to support the supply of infant formula products.""

An Abbott spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal on Friday the company found that the formula made at that plant ""is not likely the source of infection in the reported cases and that there was not an outbreak caused by products from the facility.""

As it awaits the reopening of that plant Abbott is trying to increase Similac production at its other plants and is shipping formula from Europe the Journal reported.

Similarly the maker of Enfamil has its factories running constantly to increase supply the Reckitt Benckiser Group told the Journal.

The company has ""ample supply"" but baby formula sales in the U.S. are up 18% which is ""more than double"" birth rates Reckitt told CBS News.

Reckitt has ""taken a number of measures – including shipping over 30% more product in Q1 running our factories 24/7 with 3 shifts per day and rationalizing our portfolio to focus on those sizes that allow us to provide the most formula"" the company said in a statement to USA TODAY. ""We have also significantly increased our quality assurance resources to make sure our rigorous safety standards are maintained.""

Where the formula shortage is worst

Baby formula shortages began to emerge near the end of November 2021 when about 11% of popular brands were out of stock Datasembly said. Prior to that during most of 2021 supply was ""relatively stable and (shortages) fluctuated between 2%-8%"" the research firm said in its most recent report.

The recalls supply chain shortages and inflation have affected the baby formula supply said Datasembly CEO and founder Ben Reich in the report.

“Unfortunately baby formula out-of-stock levels have continued to soar since the beginning of April and we see no indication of a slow down"" he said. Baby formula continues ""demonstrating higher out-of-stock levels than other categories"" Reich said/in an email exchange with USA TODAY.

Shortages are even worse in some states and cities.

Six states – Tennessee Texas Missouri Iowa South Dakota and North Dakota – faced supply shortages higher than 50% the week starting April 24 Datasembly said. The metro area with the highest out-of-supply rate was San Antonio with 57% followed by Memphis & Nashville (52%) and Des Moines & Houston (50%).

More than 330 pitches resulted in a business deal and an additional 280 products may eventually land on shelves at Walmart and Sam’s Club stores or online at Walmart.com.

Walmart’s Open Call event is part of the retailer’s commitment to invest $250 billion over 10 years on products made grown or assembled in the United States a milestone already reached since announcing the effort in 2013. Last year Walmart pledged to spend an additional $350 billion on such products by 2031.

“Investing in US manufacturing is not only the right thing to do for the country’s long-term economic health it's the right thing to do for customers today who are dealing with historic inflation” said Doug McMillon president and chief executive officer of Walmart. “We’re excited that more and more great products at strong price points are being produced in the US. Our $350 billion investment in items made grown or assembled in the US helps deliver our customers the goods they need when they need them at affordable prices while supporting the creation of more than 750000 jobs.”

In its ninth year Walmart’s Open Call drew applications from more than 4500 entrepreneurs registering more than 13000 products. The finalists represented all 50 states and the District of Columbia and are eligible to sell shelf-stable products on Walmart’s online platforms including Walmart.com Walmart Marketplace and Samsclub.com.

A new supplier selected through the process is Catrina’s Kitchen Louisville Ky. which offers Southern-inspired spices seasonings and breading.

“We’ve met so many amazing small business owners through Open Call over the years and this year is no exception” said Scott Gutche senior director of US manufacturing at Walmart. “From Catrina’s Kitchen Southern Seasoned Flour to EZ-gro’s Spicy Salad Mix Microgreen Growing Kit we’re so excited about the new products and people that will be joining the Walmart supplier family.” FBN",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNwaGlsYWRlbHBoaWEuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvbWFuLWdldHMtNDUtdG8tMTAwLXllYXJzLWZvci1jdXN0b2R5LWV4Y2hhbmdlLWtpbGxpbmdzLWluLXdhbG1hcnQtcGFya2luZy1sb3QvMzIzMjE0My_SAYcBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjcGhpbGFkZWxwaGlhLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL21hbi1nZXRzLTQ1LXRvLTEwMC15ZWFycy1mb3ItY3VzdG9keS1leGNoYW5nZS1raWxsaW5ncy1pbi13YWxtYXJ0LXBhcmtpbmctbG90LzMyMzIxNDMvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man Gets 45 to 100 Years for Custody Exchange Killings in Walmart Parking Lot,"A man has been sentenced to 45 to 100 years in the shooting deaths of two people last year during a custody exchange in the parking lot of a Walmart store in Whitehall Township.

Edward Joel Rosario-Jimenez 24 was sentenced after pleading guilty Thursday to third-degree murder in the February 2021 deaths of 22-year-old Jonathan Martinez and 20-year-old Nicolette Law in Lehigh County.

Officials said Martinez the child’s father had arrived with his 3-year-old child and Law his new girlfriend. Rosario-Jimenez drove a Toyota SUV to the store with the child’s mother and two other people. An argument began and the defendant shot Law and then Martinez before fleeing prosecutors said.

Law was pronounced dead that night and Martinez died just over a week later. Rosario-Jimenez was arrested a few days later and the handgun was found hidden in a snowbank. LehighValleyLive reports that video evidence showed that it was 45 seconds from the time Rosario-Jimenez arrived to when he shot the two victims.

In exchange for the plea Lehigh County prosecutors dropped plans to seek the death penalty in the case. Assistant District Attorney Steven Luksa called the sentence tantamount to a life term but Laws mother said she had wanted to see a life sentence for the man who killed her youngest child.

Judge Robert Steinberg told the defendant that he belonged “in the darkest place the state correctional institution can put you"" saying he had shown no remorse. He said it was a sad commentary on society that the killings occurred during a custody exchange.

""All their dreams and aspirations ended with your shooting of them"" the judge said of the victims.

DOING the big weekly grocery shop can be a hassle especially if you end up getting stuck in a long line at the checkout.

But a former Walmart employee has revealed that there is an easy way around the long lines - just ask for another lane to be opened.

2 A former employee has shared hacks that every customer should know including how to avoid a lengthy checkout process.

2 Apparently Walmart's policy states that there should be no more than three customers waiting in line at one time.

Former Walmart employee Paris Mars known online as Heyparis told The US Sun that if a queue is taking too long you can request another register be opened.

Walmart's policy according to Heyparis specifies that no more than three consumers should be in line at any given time.

The staff is ""not supposed to say no"" if you ask for another register to be opened she stated.

""If the line is too long and there's only like three cashiers open you can go to the cashier and say: 'Can you call someone to hop on this register that's empty because this line is too long'"" the social media influencer shared.

At the time Heyparis' own hack was to ask for a register to be opened as soon as she entered the business.

That way when she's finished shopping there aren't any long lines and she can pay and leave promptly.

While it appears that asking for assistance will help you skip a lengthy checkout process there are situations when it will not.

For instance if you have a question regarding a product the workers aren't properly trained to assist you.

""No Walmart employee is trained for any department that they're put in"" Heyparis told The US Sun.

Employees will even tell you they don't know the answer and lie about finding someone who does.

""No one else is going to come"" she said.

""You're going to be standing there for hours okay because Walmart employees do not care.""

If you're in the technology department and have a question about an iPad or a camera Heyparis said you should just read the box yourself because that's what employees are trained to do.

According to Heyparis other things to know about Walmart include the possibility of receiving a gift card if you complain respectfully.

She also shared that personnel are unlikely to search the stock room for additional items.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseWNpdGl6ZW4ubmV3cy9uZXdzL2xvY2FsX25ld3MvZGFsdG9uLWhpZ2gtYXJ0LXN0dWRlbnRzLWNyZWF0ZS1tdXJhbHMtZm9yLXdhbG1hcnQvYXJ0aWNsZV80MTFmYjM4MC1hNTU1LTExZWMtOWE3MC1mM2YwZjA2ZDVjZDkuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dalton High art students create murals for Walmart,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

DIS,Walt Disney,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9maWxtLzIwMjIvbWF5LzA3L2Rpc25leS1sZ2J0cS1jb21tdW5pdHktZ2F5LWRheXMtYW1lcmljYW4tY29uc2VydmF0aXZlc9IBY2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9maWxtLzIwMjIvbWF5LzA3L2Rpc25leS1sZ2J0cS1jb21tdW5pdHktZ2F5LWRheXMtYW1lcmljYW4tY29uc2VydmF0aXZlcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Disney found its pride – and riled the American right,"‘Christ. they’re going after Mickey Mouse” said president Joe Biden in April bemoaning the Republican party’s targeting of yet another American institution. A few days earlier at a desk surrounded by small children Florida governor Ron DeSantis had stripped Disney World of its self-governing status. Since its inception in 1967 Disney’s central Florida estate – officially the Reedy Creek Improvement District – has effectively operated under its own jurisdiction. The agreement has worked for both sides. Disney funds and manages public services in the district in return for autonomy over governance and development. Disney World has become the cornerstone of Florida’s tourist economy employing 75000 people locally. This is supposed to be Disney World’s 50th year but the company finds itself in danger of being cast out of its own magic kingdom.

DeSantis’s move was explicitly in retaliation to Disney’s opposition to HB 1557 better known as the “Don’t say gay” law. This vaguely worded bill prohibits discussion of or instruction on issues of sexual orientation or gender identity in Florida schools. After the successful weaponisation of “critical race theory” (an academic field that considers systemic discrimination in public life) Republicans have identified LGBTQ+ rights as another potential wedge issue even linking them with paedophilia and grooming. DeSantis’s press secretary Christina Pushaw tweeted that the bill could be “more accurately described as an anti-grooming bill”. Disney responded with a statement calling for HB 1557 to be struck down in the courts.

Sign up to our Inside Saturday newsletter for an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the making of the magazine’s biggest features as well as a curated list of our weekly highlights.

To Republicans Disney had crossed a line by interfering in politics. “Ultimately this state is governed by the best interests of the people of this state not what any one corporation is demanding” DeSantis said as he signed the bill. Viewed from the opposite side DeSantis is using the power of the state to punish a private corporation for its political views – a significant escalation in the culture wars and a worrying look for a democracy. How did it come to this?

In truth conservatives have been going after Mickey Mouse for a long time now. Disney which now owns Star Wars Marvel Pixar and 20th Century Studios is the US’s pre-eminent cultural superpower with particular influence over children. In recent years it has been targeted for its “woke” values in terms of inclusion and diversity in matters of race gender and sexuality both in its content and its employment practices. In terms of the LGBTQ+ community though Disney’s relationship goes far deeper and it has developed in ways the company itself can never have anticipated.

Many Disney stories could be interpreted as explorations of sexuality or gender identity

Walt Disney was never a card-carrying homophobe but he was a steadfast conservative and long after his death in 1966 Disney’s output continued to promote “traditional” and “family” values. That didn’t discount “coding” Disney characters (usually villains) as queer in that they exhibited stereotypically gay attributes such as effeminate behaviour or disinterest in the opposite sex: Jafar in Aladdin for example or Scar in The Lion King or even Shere Khan the tiger in The Jungle Book. And as with all forms of culture Disney stories have lent themselves to queer readings regardless of their makers’ intentions.

Dealing with themes of fantasy and magic many classic Disney stories concern characters moving between two worlds feeling like outsiders in their communities transforming and becoming their true selves. These themes could equally be interpreted as explorations of sexuality or gender identity. Cinderella goes from dowdy domestic to sparkling princess at the wave of a wand; Mowgli must decide whether he belongs in the jungle or the village; Mulan masquerades as male to join the Chinese army during which time she forms an ambiguous bond with the handsome captain. Princess Elsa in Frozen is urged by her parents to suppress her true nature but after she is figuratively “outed” (as a sorceress) she flees her heteronormative destiny preferring to belt out Let It Go in icy isolation: “Don’t let them in don’t let them see / Be the good girl you always have to be / Conceal don’t feel don’t let them know …”

Disney films have helped queer people discover their sexuality says George Youngdahl a lifelong fan. “Tarzan Aladdin Peter Pan Hercules – all of those were people who I wanted to emulate and I was attracted to. I wasn’t looking at the princesses or I was because I wanted to be them not necessarily because I thought they were attractive.” After his first visit to California’s Disneyland Youngdahl applied for a job at Florida’s Disney World when he was 25. He moved to Florida and worked for Disney for 15 years.

Although Disney would never admit it queer themes have sometimes been more deliberate than accidental. One of the unsung LGBTQ+ heroes of Disney lore for example is Howard Ashman the openly gay lyricist and producer who died of an Aids-related illness in 1991. With a background in musical theatre Ashman was instrumental in bringing Disney classics The Little Mermaid Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin to the screen and his involvment is obvious in the final releases.

In The Little Mermaid for example Ariel is told by her domineering father that the human world is evil and forbidden but to Ariel it looks like more fun. “Up where they walk up where they run / Up where they stay all day in the sun / Wanderin’ free wish I could be / Part of that world” she sings. The fact that the evil sea witch Ursula was modelled on renowned drag artist Divine only adds to the queer appeal. (The original Little Mermaid was written as an allegory for same-sex attraction incidentally: Hans Christian Andersen was inspired to write the fairytale by his unrequited love for another man.)

“Kids even in the most accepting of environments grow up knowing that they’re different and unsure of how that’s going to play out in the world” says Eddie Shapiro co-author of Queens in the Kingdom an LGBTQ+ guide to Disney’s theme parks. “So there’s a sense of otherness. And in the Disney universe the characters who triumph the Dumbos of the world are frequently also other. And they come out on top or they come out loved supported safe. And that’s a big comfort.”

It is fair to also call Shapiro something of a Disney super-fan. As we speak he is on a Disney cruise from Florida to Castaway Cay Disney’s private resort island in the Bahamas. As with the movies Disney theme parks have a certain appeal from an LGBTQ+ perspective he says. “Disney offers a perfect world that never was” he says. “You didn’t always feel safe as a gay kid now you’re walking down Main Street USA and everything is manicured everything is clean. Everybody’s friendly. It’s perfect – something that appeals to the child within.”

Disney initially resisted attempts by LGBTQ+ visitors to express their fandom at its theme parks. In the 1980s the company was twice sued for prohibiting men dancing together at Disney World for example. But in June 1991 a man named Doug Swallow organised a coordinated mass trip to Disney World attended by 3000 LGBTQ+ people wearing red shirts to identify themselves. This was the park’s first Gay Day and it has continued ever since. The event now brings more than 150000 LGBTQ+ people to Orlando every June.

In the early years Disney would warn “straight” visitors when it was Gay Day and hand out white T-shirts to non-participants who had inadvertently turned up wearing red. While Disney does not officially recognise Gay Day it soon came to appreciate the commercial clout of the LGBTQ+ community. There is no end of rainbow-coloured Disney merchandise on sale and Disney accommodates and facilitates the Gay Day schedule of events including a week-long festival taking place across the city with club nights drag shows pool parties and special hotel deals.

After his first Florida Gay Day in 1998 Shapiro founded a sister Gay Day Anaheim at the Los Angeles Disneyland. While Orlando Gay Days are more party-centric the lower-key Anaheim event takes place mostly inside the park. There is a high level of cooperation. Disney now hosts a table at its welcome centre promoting fairytale gay weddings at Disneyland and hosts premieres at Gay Day.

“Gay Day was never formed with a political agenda” says Shapiro. The idea was always integration rather than segregation. “You’re mixing with traditional families and hopefully changing some hearts and minds. It was not at all lost on us that we were showing up at America’s number one family destination with our families of choice and announcing by being there that [we] were worthy and should absolutely be there and stand up and be counted. And we’re still doing that.”

Can Disney operate as an umbrella brand for everybody during this kind of culture war? Matthew Belloni

Disney has learned to embrace LGBTQ+ friendliness on screen and off in recent decades. In 1995 it became one of the first companies to offer health benefits to same-sex partners of employees (prompting a considerable conservative backlash in the process). Meanwhile it has taken tentative steps towards representation on screen. Even if its “openly gay character” proclamations rarely live up to the billing there have been fleeting references to same-sex relationships in movies including Toy Story 4 (two women drop off their daughter at kindergarten); Onward (Lena Waithe’s cop refers to her girlfriend); the live-action Beauty and the Beast remake (the character LeFou played by Josh Gad is telegraphed as gay and dances with another man although not even Gad was particularly proud of that one; “I don’t think we did justice to what a real gay character in a Disney film should be” he admitted). Jack Whitehall went a step further playing a gay man in Disney’s live-action film Jungle Cruise last year. And Pixar was recently reported to be casting for a voice actor to play a “14-year-old transgender girl” in an upcoming project.

But Disney has always balanced its support for the LGBTQ+ community with its appeal to more conservative-leaning consumers which could be seen as playing both sides. The corporation was recently revealed to have donated almost $1m to the Republican party of Florida in 2020 and $50000 directly to DeSantis – none of which appears to have deterred him from targeting Disney.

Many insiders blame Disney’s mishandling of the Florida issue on its new CEO Bob Chapek. His predecessor Bob Iger is regarded as a hero for presiding over Disney’s canny acquisitions of LucasFilm Marvel and Pixar and launching Disney+ all while vocally supporting progressive causes such as Black Lives Matter during the Trump administration. Chapek who came from Disney’s parks division is reportedly more conservative-leaning more managerial and less experienced at this kind of political diplomacy.

When DeSantis first announced the “Don’t say gay” bill in early March Chapek’s response was to stay silent. He sent an internal email to Disney staff expressing his support for the LGBTQ+ community but claiming “corporate statements do very little to change outcomes or minds. Instead they are often weaponised by one side or the other to further divide and inflame.” This enraged Disney’s LGBTQ+ staff and their allies. Pixar employees released a statement alleging that Disney executives had demanded cuts from “nearly every moment of overtly gay affection” in its movies. In response Chapek gave a public apology “You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights and I let you down. I am sorry.” That was not enough to prevent a series of staff walkouts leading up to the signing of the bill on 22 March. Hence Disney’s more confrontational statement about seeking to have the law repealed and struck down.

“There is a widespread belief that this was bungled and it’s a belief not just inside the company but in the Hollywood community at large” says Matthew Belloni ex-editor of the Hollywood Reporter. “If they had remained on the sidelines lobbied behind the scenes and made employees know that they cared about the issue but didn’t do so in a way that provoked the politicians they could have in my opinion gotten away with advocacy without becoming a punching bag.”

If it happens the removal of Disney World’s special status which would come into effect in June 2023 is likely to hurt local citizens more than Disney itself. The burden of running the district’s public services will now fall to taxpayers and could translate into additional bills for locals. As his public signing of the anti-Disney law surrounded by schoolchildren suggests DeSantis who many see as a presidential contender is essentially engaging in political theatre. But potentially more harmful than the attacks on Disney is the “Don’t say gay” bill itself which is likely to cause long-lasting harm to Florida’s young LGBTQ+ people and their educators.

As with previous occasions when conservatives have “gone after Mickey Mouse” this latest attack is likely to blow over. “Disney is such a large corporation that I don’t think this specific punishment is going to register in the grand scheme of things” says Belloni. “It’s more about how it moves forward and whether it can operate as a down-the-middle umbrella brand for everybody amid this kind of culture war that it has found itself the centre of.”

Maybe Disney doesn’t have to pick a side. The Republicans’ current tactics feel like an attempt to turn back the clock – ironically to an era and a set of values Disney once embodied. But Disney is compelled to look in the opposite direction led by a market that is increasingly global young and diverse. While Disney’s centrism can be interpreted cynically as playing both sides or more generously catering to all tastes the important thing is that “centre” has moved a considerable way during the company’s lifetime – and Disney has moved with it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1lcGFya2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2ZsdW1lLzIwMjIwNS84OTMzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Does the New Guardians Coaster Rank Among Disney Rides?,"How Does the New Guardians Coaster Rank Among Disney Rides?

So where does the new Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind rank among Disney's theme park rides?

A reader asked me in the comments on my review of the new Epcot attraction how Cosmic Rewind would rank in the hierarchy of Disney Mountains. That's a great question but I am going to dismiss it on a technicality since I do not consider Cosmic Rewind a ""Disney Mountain.""

This indoor roller coaster is accessed through the Wonders of Xandar pavilion in Epcot's World Discovery. It does not have the word ""Mountain"" in its name nor is it built on or within a mountain facade. Sure Cosmic Rewind's show building is bigger than some Disney mountains but without a mountain to be seen in its name or setting I cannot put Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind into the Disney Mountains family.

That said I would rank Cosmic Rewind highly among these elite Disney attractions and when considering non-Mountain rides as well. Just so you know where I am coming from here is my ranking of the Disney Mountains. My elite top three are:

Expedition Everest

Splash Mountain

Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars

And the rest:

Big Thunder Mountain Railroad

Space Mountain

Seven Dwarfs Mine Train

Matterhorn Bobsleds

Paris has the best installations of Thunder and Space while Orlando has the weakest. I would rank Matterhorn higher if Disney could give us some comfortable sleds but they haven't so the west coast home of the Yeti gets my last place.

Looking at non-Mountain Disney attractions the top 10 favorites from our annual reader survey are:

Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance

Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Sunken Treasure

Avatar: Flight of Passage

The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror

Indiana Jones Adventure

Journey to the Center of the Earth

Pirates of the Caribbean (Disneyland)

Radiator Springs Racers

Mystic Manor

Guardians of the Galaxy: Mission Breakout

I am good with that list though I would suggest that Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway should go on it instead of Mission Breakout. I also prefer Tokyo's Tower of Terror to the Twilight Zone version and would be happy swapping Haunted Mansion for Radiator Springs Racers or maybe the ailing Disneyland installation of Indiana Jones though Tokyo's more-functional version still beats Mansion in my book.

So where does Cosmic Rewind rank?

First up I think it's the better of Disney's two Guardians of the Galaxy attractions. While I love Mission Breakout the joy of drifting through space on Cosmic Rewind holds more appeal for me than the Yo-Yo action on Mission Breakout.

So that gets Cosmic Rewind up into the non-Mountain Top 10. Among the Walt Disney World attractions on that list I cannot rank Cosmic Rewind higher than Flight of Passage since the Guardians coaster lacks anything that tops that exhilarating emotional moment near the end of Animal Kingdom's Pandora flying theater ride. They're both great attractions - well worth the effort to experience them - but Flight of Passage remains my choice if you told me I could go on one or the other again now that I have been on both.

So that puts Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind third for me among top attractions at the Walt Disney World Resort behind Rise of the Resistance and Flight of Passage and juuust ahead of Runaway Railway. As such Cosmic Rewind ranks easily as my top pick at Epcot.

And since I have Guardians therefore ranked ahead of Expedition Everest in my book I guess that means that I consider Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind as the the King of the Disney Mountains.

Even if it isn't a Disney Mountain.

The original video was posted on TikTok and has garnered over 3 million views as of Sunday.

""We are sickened to our stomachs seeing Nazi flags flown at Disney World in Orlando FL a few hours ago"" tweeted non-partisan organization Stop Antisemitism.

Many social media users have taken to Twitter to express their outrage and criticized Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for not issuing any condemnation of the incident.

Last month DeSantis signed a bill that strips Disney World of its status as an ""independent special district"" multiple media sources confirmed. Before then Disney operated as an ""independent government around its Orlando-area theme parks"" according to a CNN report. Ron DeSantis Florida Governor (credit: Courtesy)

DeSantis said that the bill was punishment for Disney standing in opposition to the Florida governor's ""Don't Say Gay"" law.

In February DeSantis refused to condemn a Nazi rally in Orlando that had taken place claiming that those asking him to condemn it are trying to “smear” him.

Wade and a draft is not quite a ruling but it’s been refreshing to finally be hearing nothing from business leaders on this contentious cultural issue.

Maybe our corporate elite has finally woken up to the notion that it’s bad business to piss off more than half the country with virtue-signaling on progressive issues. Or maybe they’re ignoring the political noise and keeping busy doing what they get paid to do — trying to run profitable companies that provide returns for their shareholders.

Either way silence is golden and we can thank Florida Gov. Ron ­DeSantis for making it happen.

DeSantis did something that would have made movie character Jimmy Malone proud. Malone played by Sean Connery in the 1987 flick “The Untouchables” is the tough veteran cop who explained to Eliot Ness how to beat Al Capone and his criminal gang: “They pull a knife you pull a gun. He sends one of yours to the hospital you send one of his to the morgue.”

For the record: I’m NOT advocating violence in defeating the corporate wokesters or anyone for that matter.

But there is something to be said about following Jimmy Malone’s logic and taking the battle to corporate woke gangsters if they choose to become an arm of the AOC-Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party. And that’s exactly what DeSantis did in his battle and convincing victory over the virtue-signaling of the Disney theme-park and entertainment corporate empire.

According to my sources the C-suite types weren’t just closely watching but also learning something about a new brand of GOP politics after DeSantis counter-punched Disney CEO Bob Chapek.

Chapek thought it was a smart idea to follow the lead of some of his far-left employees who demanded he speak out against a Florida law they inaccurately and libelously dubbed “Don’t Say Gay.”

Keep in mind the law doesn’t say that all; it merely states that kids from kindergarten through the third grade don’t need sex-ed lessons or gender-identity preaching when they’re supposed to be learning the ABCs and how to add.

Lefty rallying cry

The cultural left doesn’t really care about the truth when it comes to advancing its agenda. Left-wingers and their friends in the media created the fake meme as part of a rallying cry hoping to generate public and corporate pressure to get the state to back down. And it worked at least for awhile. After keeping his mouth shut (Smart!) Chapek gave in to the woke heat (Dumb!) and publicly attacked the law.

Disney’s corporate headquarters are in Burbank Calif. But it’s fair to say Florida is its second home. It’s among Florida’s largest employers. The Disney World theme park is a cultural landmark of the state so much so that the company has received corporate welfare writ large for decades and its complex near Orlando operates as a de facto independent local government.

No longer. DeSantis did what lawmakers should have done when all those corporate CEOs decided to give in to the woke mobs in the streets and on Twitter by attacking Georgia’s voting law as racist when it merely checks for ID: He fought back.

He didn’t just criticize Disney and Chapek for political grandstanding he pushed through the Florida legislature a law that rescinds the company’s corporate-welfare goodies which includes tax breaks access to the low-cost municipal bond market and other privileges.

Then came this warning from the Republican governor: “If you are in one of these corporations if you’re a woke CEO you want to get involved in our legislative business look it’s a free country. But understand if you do that I’m fighting back against you. And I’m going to make sure that people understand your business practices and anything I don’t like about what you’re doing.”

DeSantis is despised by the left and most of the media because he embodies many of Donald Trump’s winning instincts without the former president’s losing rough spots (meaning no tweeting out of the Florida governor).

That’s why he remains popular in his state and should cruise to re­election despite barely defeating his Dem opponent four years ago. The Disney fight isn’t going to hurt his standing with voters. He’s already considered a 2024 GOP presidential contender and fellow GOP public officials are likely to follow his lead when it comes to fighting back when the business community locks arms with the left.

Fighting back

My DC sources say that if the GOP takes the House and Senate in this year’s midterms look for them to go on the offense against corporate wokesters. There’s already talk in GOP circles of public hearings forcing CEOs to explain why they think it’s in the best interests of their shareholders to weigh in and support lefty issues which are opposed by many Americans.

If my sources are telling me this I’m pretty sure the army of lobbyists employed by Wall Street and even Big Tech are telling their CEOs the same thing. Maybe that’s why we’ve heard so little from them about the draft Roe v. Wade ruling.

If they’re smart they’ll keep it that way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpc25leXRvdXJpc3RibG9nLmNvbS9yZXNpZGVuY2UtaW5uLW9ybGFuZG8tZmxhbWluZ28tY3Jvc3NpbmdzLWhvdGVsLW5lYXItZGlzbmV5LXdvcmxkLXJldmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Residence Inn Orlando at Flamingo Crossings: Disney World Hotel Review,

From the original merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications in 1990 to the infamous AOL/Time Warner Merger in 2000 to the AT&T Inc. (T Financial) acquisition in 2018 the company seems to change it corporate structure every 10 years or so. Now in 2022 we have what many hope to be the final reshuffling of these core businesses for quite some time when the Warner Media businesses merged with Discovery Communications to form Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD Financial).

This new media powerhouse hosts the legacy Warner assets such as cable channels TBS TNT HBO and CNN as well as Warner Bros. movie and television studios and legacy Discovery assets such as Discovery Channel Food Network HGTV and TLC. As with most media companies today streaming services are of course a focus for the company. Primary streaming channels include HBO Max and Discovery+.

CNN+

One of the company’s first stumbles came in April when it announced it was going shut down its streaming version of CNN called CNN+. The service was rolled out March 29 after spending $300 million to attract big-name journalists. The streaming service never found a big audience with an average of only 10000 daily users in the first few weeks after launch. The company had planned to spend approximately $1 billion on the service in the first four years to grow the audience and make it profitable. The overabundance of streaming options currently available and the reluctance of consumers to pay for a multitude of these services seems to be having an affect on the streaming industry. If a consumer is paying for seven or more streaming services why not just pay for cable or satellite TV for the same price where you get 100s of ""streams?""

Financials

The first-quarter results for the company which were released April 26 only include the former Discovery business and not WarnerMedia as the merger occurred on April 8. Nonetheless results were strong with revenue growing 15% on a constant currency basis and adjusted Ebitda increasing 23%. When looking at WarnerMedia results from AT&T’s first-quarter results revenue also increased 15% but operating income was down significantly due to heavy investments in the HBO Max streaming service. On a combined basis the new company would have generated $45 billion in revenue in 2021.

One of the principal reasons for the spinoff from AT&T was to reduce debt so the new Warner Bros. Discovery is highly leveraged. Long-term debt on a pro-forma basis is $56 billion but the company expects $14 billion in Ebitda in 2023. Due to strong free cash flow generation management stated the leverage ratio will be approximately 3 times within a 24-month time period after closing.

Valuation

Analysts are still trying to figure out the earnings potential of the company going forward. This year's earnings per share estimates of 60 cents are somewhat meaningless due to the April 8 closing date and expected synergies are not anticipated to kick in until next year. 2023 estimates are more reasonable in the $1.61 to $1.91 range creating a very low forward price-earnings ratio. The forward enterprise value/Ebitda valuation are approximately 7 to 8 times based on $14 billion in Ebitda in 2023. This a discount to most streaming peers.

Guru trades

Gurus who have purchased or added to their Warner Bros. Discovery positions include Jeremy Grantham (Trades Portfolio) and John Hussman (Trades Portfolio). Gurus who have reduced their positions include Ken Fisher (Trades Portfolio) and Mark Hillman (Trades Portfolio). Note that these transactions pertain to the former Discovery entity as the merger transaction closed after the March 31 filing date.

Conclusion

Warner Bros. Discovery laid out four strategic priorities for the new company which include creating world-class content widespread global distribution a balanced asset monetization model from different revenue streams and strong and lasting free cash flow generation. This means that although the company hopes to be a streaming leader with HBO Max it will still maintain strong positions in traditional advertising revenue and content distribution.

The stock appears to be undervalued based on the company’s and analysts' outlooks. The current leverage ratio of approximately 4.5 times is something to watch but strong free cash flow generation should alleviate those concerns over the long term.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXh0dHYuY29tL25ld3MvbGlvbnMtZ2F0ZS1jZW8tZmVsdGhlaW1lci1vbi10aGUtaGJvLW1heC1kaXNjb3ZlcnktY29tYm8teW91cmUtZ29pbmctdG8tdGhyb3ctaXQtYWxsLWluLXRoZXJlLWFuZC10aGF0cy1nb2luZy10by1iZS13b3J0aC1kb2xsYXI0MC1iaWxsaW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lionsgate CEO Feltheimer on the HBO Max-Discovery Combo: 'You're Going to Throw It All in There and That's Going ...,"Chief Executive Officer of Liberty Global Mike Fries and CEO of Lionsgate Entertainment Jon Feltheimer speak at SeriesFest Season 8: Innovation Talks at the Sie FilmCenter on May 06 2022 in Denver Colorado.

""The family"" presents a special relationship -- you can say things others maybe can't.

Perhaps that's what Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer was thinking Friday when speaking alongside Liberty Global CEO Mike Fries at SeriesFest in Denver he gave ""advice"" to newly christened Warner Bros. Discovery chief David Zaslav.

Feltheimer seemed to question Zaslav's core strategy: merging HBO with Discovery to achieve more scale will justify the $43 billion paid to AT&T to spin off WarnerMedia and merge it with Discovery.

""HBO has such a refined important brand and even just frankly expanding HBO to HBO Max what do you do with that?"" said Feltheimer who's comments were related to Next TV Saturday morning by SeriesFest reps.

""So now you add all of this Discovery product nonfiction programming and for what you paid what $40 billion for enterprise value right? And you gonna throw it all on there or is that going to add $40 billion of value? I don't know"" Feltheimer said.

And he kept going: ""One might have said ‘Well keep it off to the side it may be a discrete group of buyers and you're not cannibalizing that one plus one equals maybe less than two.""

As Feltheimer also noted HBO is a key client for Lionsgate with the ""mini-major"" studio currently producing six shows for the outlet including Julia and Minx.

Notably however the ties between Lions Gate and Discovery run deep. Liberty Global Discovery's largest shareholder also owns a large chunk of Lions Gate with both Fries and Zaslav joining the Lions Gate board of directors in 2015 when that latter position was consummated. Zaslav only stepped down from the Lions Gate board last year when he was named CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery.

For his part however Feltheimer didn't appear exactly cagey the whole session which was also covered by the Penske Showbiz Trade Conglomerate's Deadline.

When pressed by Fries to assess Netflix's suddenly challenging business climate Feltheimer remarked ""They decided they were just going to do a slash and burn and get to more subs than anyone and no one would ever catch them. They would just spend and spend and if anyone else tried to spend as much they would go out of business. That was pretty much their strategy. But they got to a point where they started slowing down and we had the pandemic. And I think that maybe they didn’t pivot quite quickly enough. But they’re going to pivot.

Discovery Platforms,"A peak audience of 4.5 million BBC viewers watched the final of the World Snooker Championship on Monday night the highest figure for eight years.

Ronnie O’Sullivan made history with a record equalling seventh victory at the Crucible beating Judd Trump 18-13 in the final. The 4.5 million peak on BBC Two was the highest since 2014 and an increase of 17% on last year.

The average audience for the evening session was 3.1 million with a 20% share of the overall viewing audience. Overall across the event the share of audience was up 30% on last year.

Across BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website there were a record 22.5 million requests across the Championship including 2.8 million during the final.

Warner Bros. Discovery Sports which shows the tournament in over 50 countries across Europe also recorded extremely strong figures on its Eurosport linear channel. Overall the World Championship was its best tournament on record in the UK in terms of average audience and market share with the final seeing a 29% increase against 2021. Other countries including Italy Poland Spain Germany and France also hit record numbers on Eurosport.

The World Snooker Championship was the most streamed sport on discovery+ UK during the event period with the highest viewing time per unique video viewer across the duration of the tournament. The event was one of the top acquisition drivers among new subscribers during that period demonstrating strong viewership on Warner Bros. Discovery services across both linear and direct-to-consumer platforms. Fan engagement across its digital platforms saw healthy performance against 2021 with Eurosport.co.uk generating a 113% rise in page views a 26% increase in unique users plus a 167% growth in media starts.

WST Chairman Steve Dawson said: “We are delighted to see significant increases in viewing figures on both BBC and Eurosport. This underlines the enduring popularity of snooker for our core audience and the fact that we are also bringing in new fans.

It provides waste collection waste disposal transfer and recycling services in the U.S. and Canada.

The company recently reported earnings. Revenue came in at $1.64 billion a beat of $30 million and an 18% increase year-over-year. Earnings per share were essentially in-line at $0.82 but a miss of $0.01 nonetheless.

In addition the company is still expecting to meet its cash flow guidance for the year. However the stock still sold off following the release causing it to close lower on the week.

Waste Connections is an essential business that provides some stability during periods of uncertainty. However this predictability comes at a premium with the stock trading at a P/E ratio of 53 times. As a result we are neutral on the stock.

Growth Catalysts

Collecting waste is an essential service that modern societies simply cannot go without. Removing this service would quickly lead to piles of garbage everywhere on the streets. If we thought COVID-19 was bad the diseases that would be caused by garbage strewn about could be potentially worse.

Furthermore the waste management industry is a very capEx-intensive business that requires heavy investment to simply get started. In addition a company requires an ability to run operations unprofitably for a while as it gains traction in its market

As a result a company like Waste Connections has a lot of pricing power due to the business’s necessity and the high barriers to entry. Therefore the company is able to hedge against inflation by passing on costs to customers.

In addition since Waste Connections is one of the more prominent players in the industry it can grow through acquisitions which it has been doing. What we like about its approach to acquisitions is the fact that it doesn’t take on too much leverage to do so indicating that the company is responsibly managed.

Waste Connections is Predictable

The way we like to determine a company’s level of predictability is by analyzing its free cash flow trend. We want to see relatively smooth growth over a long period of time.

In Waste Connections’ case the free cash flow has been increasing every year (with the exception of 2020) over the past decade. This has undoubtedly been aided by its acquisition strategy. However it’s good to see that the acquisitions are adding to the free cash flows instead of impacting it negatively.

Waste Connections has been able to maintain reasonably consistent free cash flow margins over the past decade as well. Since 2012 the range has been between 13.3% to 17.6% with the majority of the time being greater than 15%.

Valuation

To value Waste Connections we will use a single-stage DCF model. We’ll use this because its main growth driver is acquiring companies which uses up a large portion of the company’s free cash flow. This means that most of the money doesn’t actually go to shareholders.

Therefore instead of trying to speculate how much money will be spent on future acquisitions and the impact they will have on future cash flows we will value the company assuming no acquisitions.

Since WCN is a mature company we believe the growth rate will be close to long-term GDP growth. Thus we will use the 30-year U.S. Treasury yield as a proxy for expected long-term GDP growth for the terminal growth rate.

Our calculation is as follows:

Fair Value = Average FCF per share / (Discount Rate – Terminal Growth)

$85.07 = $3.64 / (0.075 – 0.0322)

As a result we estimate that the fair value of Waste Connections is approximately $85.07 under current market conditions.

Dividend

For investors that like dividends Waste Connections is not the stock for income because it currently has a 0.62% dividend yield which is above the sector average of 0.45% but well below current treasury yields. Nonetheless with a payout ratio of 30% the current dividend payment is likely safe.

Looking at its historical dividend payments we can see that its yield range has been relatively flat in the past five years.

At 0.62% the company’s dividend is near the lower end of its range implying that the stock price is trading at a premium relative to the yields investors have seen in the past.

Wall Street’s Take

Turning to Wall Street Waste Connections has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on nine Buys one Hold and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The average Waste Connections price target of $149.20 implies a 17.71% upside potential.

Analysts’ price targets range from a low of $132.01 per share to a high of $161 per share.

Final Thoughts

There’s no question that Waste Connections is a good business that effectively turns trash into cash. As an industry leader it has the cash flow to acquire smaller players in order to grow its market share and appears to be doing so responsibly.

Nonetheless the valuation is not cheap which is why we are neutral on the stock.

People come to Las Vegas for a lot of reasons. Some come for conventions. Some come for the magic shows Cirque du Soleil or Celine Dion. A lot of people come to gamble. Some come purely for the spectacle of it all. But everyone who comes to Las Vegas knows about the buffets.

Those legendary Las Vegas buffets — with everything from salad to sirloin — fuel the trips of more than 42 million visitors per year. Caesars Palace’s Bacchanal Buffet alone offers more than 500 food items serving more than 3500 visitors daily. The buffets are “all you can eat” but not all is eaten. Inevitably some of that food goes to waste.

And that is a microcosm of what happens at the national level. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture about 30 percent to 40 percent of the U.S. food supply is wasted. Some of that waste is caused by food spoiling but the vast majority of it is food that was purchased but not eaten like the food presented on display at Las Vegas buffets.

Food waste creates myriad economic challenges including the expense and labor involved in producing the food in the first place the fuel and transportation costs of getting it from farm to market the costs of handling and selling the food and finally the value of the food product itself. The USDA estimates the true cost of food waste at about $218 billion per year.

Simply put: Food waste as a category is a large and growing contributor to the detrimental impacts of waste on the environment and the economy. It also impacts world hunger.

Although the United States currently produces twice as much food as it needs to serve its 330 million citizens according to analytics firm SAS roughly 54 million people in the U.S. are food-insecure. In Nevada alone there are more than 373000 people experiencing food insecurity many of them children.

Las Vegas produces more than 5 billion pounds of waste per year. Most of that waste — food and all — ends up at the landfill. If all of that wasted food made its way to food pantries or shelters there would not be any hunger. The food exists to solve that problem but instead of going to good use it goes to landfills.

Given the vast amounts of food produced in Las Vegas at its more than 40 buffets and more than 4000 restaurants it is without a doubt one of the leading contributors to the abundance of food waste in the United States. The Strip alone has more than 30 resorts each with restaurants and many with buffets. Each produces food waste.

One novel method of diverting this waste from landfills in Las Vegas is the pig farm. Resorts such as Aria Bellagio Luxor and The Venetian send mountains of food waste to Las Vegas Livestock about 30 miles northeast of the city. There the farm’s 4000 or so pigs eat roughly 20 tons of food waste per day — all from the Strip. But that 20 tons is only part of the problem.

The true magnitude of the food waste epidemic in Las Vegas is likely unknowable. But given that Las Vegas consumes nearly 30 tons of shrimp per day alone the total amount of food consumed — and wasted — is colossal.

Pigs alone will not solve this problem. Las Vegas as a global leader in hospitality must commit to a more sustainable solution for dealing with food waste. More of it must be diverted from landfills and less of it must be created in the first place.

Food waste is a problem with economic societal environmental and moral implications. We must come together to resolve this crisis.

Frosty temperatures. Gusting winds. Unrelenting rain. A course so water-logged it’s mindful of a sponge rimmed with thick drenched punishing rough.

Now imagine that quartet of misery as a collective and you have Saturday’s third round of the Wells Fargo Championship at TPC Potomac at Avenel Farm north of the nation’s capital.

“Just get around literally just any way possible” Matthew Fitzpatrick said about his game-plan for Saturday. He did OK with a 71.

Most others weren’t so fortunate on a day the thermometer never reached 50 and the winds made it feel cooler. As well the clouds kept spitting rain throughout the day adding to the 3 inches of H2O that fell on the course the past two days.

Which of course kept TPC Potomac soaked making for some interesting lies despite players being allowed to lift clean and place.

“It feels like I’ve just gone 12 rounds in a pro boxing match” said Anirban Lahiri who shot 70. “You’re fighting everything you’re fighting your body the elements the water the cold the conditions. It’s tough work and you just have to grit your teeth and kind of grind it out.”

After a dry Thursday when the field averaged 69.58 strokes the players posted averages of 72.57 on rainy Friday and 73.67 on Saturday; that was the highest average relative to par in a non-major since the final round of the 2020 Memorial.

In the third round only four of the 65 players broke par including three-time Wells Fargo winner and defending champion Rory McIlroy who moved from a tie for 50th to a tie for sixth with a 68.

The leader however is Keegan Bradley who somehow shot 3-under-par 67 to grab the 54-hole lead. The 2011 PGA Championship winner is looking for his first win since the 2018 BMW Championship which finished on Monday because of storms throughout the week. Bradley made just two bogeys.

“When the conditions get like this I find a sense of calm just because I’m sort of worried about other things keeping my clubs dry and my bag dry. Sort of keeps me in the present. I did that today and I just had a great time with my caddie Scotty (Vail). We’re a good team and we did a lot of good things today” Bradley said. “My coach Darren May and my caddie Scotty are in my ear that these sort of conditions are good for me. When you look at the weather the extended weather as a player you get sort of stressed when you see this even though everyone’s playing in it it’s silly. But they were sort of in my ear saying this is what you want you want it to be windy and tough. I’m starting to believe them.”

Bradley is at 8 under.

Max Homa the 2019 Wells Fargo winner who had the lead earlier in the day shot 71 and is at 6 under. At 4 under are Lahiri and James Hahn the 2016 Wells Fargo winner; Hahn shot 72. At 3 under is Fitzpatrick. A large collection is at 2 under including McIlroy Cameron Young (69) and Matthew Wolff (70).

“Six shots is still six shots” McIlroy said. “It depends what the weather’s like tomorrow. I’d like it to be pretty tough. I know it’s probably not going to be as wet. It’s going to be quite cold. I don’t know what the wind’s going to be like. I can’t imagine tomorrow being any tougher than today was.

“You can’t really chase much around here because it’s a tough golf course but like six shots is still a long way back.”

The forecast is for a rainless day. But the temps will still not reach 50.

It certainly wasn’t Jason Day’s day in the third round. The 2015 PGA Championship victor looking for his first win since the 2018 Wells Fargo Championship looked stellar through 36 holes and led by three shots at 10 under.

But he hit tee shots into water hazards on consecutive holes early in his third round hit his approach on the par-5 10th into a swamp made just one birdie and shot 79.

“I just didn’t have my stuff today” Day said. “Just trying to think. I made a lot of errors out there and hitting into penalty areas. It’s OK. I’ve just got to get back to it tomorrow and try and find some positives from the first two days going into tomorrow’s round.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vZ29sZi5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLXdlbGxzLWZhcmdvLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcC1wdXJzZS_SATpodHRwczovL2dvbGYuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi13ZWxscy1mYXJnby1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAtcHVyc2Uv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 Wells Fargo Championship purse: Payout info winner's share,"2022 Wells Fargo Championship purse: Payout info winner’s share

These two businesses came together through the $19 billion acquisition of SanDisk in 2016 which led the company to diversify its nearly five-decade business away from HDD and it became one of the largest Flash players in the industry.

Activist Commentary: Elliott is a very successful and astute activist investor particularly in the technology sector. Their team includes analysts from leading tech private equity firms engineers operating partners – former technology CEO and COOs. When evaluating an investment they also hire specialty and general management consultants expert cost analysts and industry specialists. They often watch companies for many years before investing and have an extensive stable of impressive board candidates.

On May 3 2022  Elliott sent a letter to Western Digital's board expressing its belief that the company should separate its NAND flash memory business. Elliott called on the board to conduct a full strategic review and expressed its belief that such a separation could lead to a stock price of $100+ per share by the end of 2023.

As new ""activists"" come on to the scene we have seen a fair amount of ""sell the company"" activism with no detailed plan or reason why. We have been very critical of this style of activism as short term and greedy. Those activists who did not understand why we were being so critical should read Elliott's letter as an example of well thought out deeply analyzed shareholder-focused strategic activism campaign. Elliott provides a detailed 13-page letter of why the company's two businesses need to be separated and a plan to achieve the separation that is in the best interest of shareholders.

The company is one of the largest providers of storage components for data infrastructure globally and has built a successful HDD business. However the HDD industry began a slow decline in 2013 as desktop and notebook PCs transitioned toward faster NAND flash solid-state drives (SSDs). So in 2015 the company announced it would acquire SanDisk for $19 billion to enter the higher-growth Flash industry. In the years following this acquisition the HDD industry rebounded and has now become a growth market again with Western Digital as one of the two dominant providers of this technology behind Seagate. Western Digital is the only company today that operates in both HDD and NAND flash.

In the last six years the company has underperformed in several areas. First they have attempted to deliver on the strategic synergies of a combined HDD and Flash portfolio but have lost market share in both HDD and Flash. Second the operational missteps have consistently led to unfulfilled financial targets including in revenue compound annual growth rate gross margins operating expenses and operating margin. Third the company has poor stock price performance returning -23.10% 6.14% and -39.57% over the past 1- 3- and 5-year periods versus -0.89% 41.07% and 74.0% for the S&P 500 respectively.

In its letter Elliott makes a convincing argument that the reason why Western Digital is underperforming is because the two businesses should not be in the same company. Both businesses are solid and have good market share but would have significantly more value as standalones. HDD and Flash are totally different technologies: spinning mechanical disks versus leading-edge semiconductor devices. The manufacturing processes are separate and while the businesses share common customers the products can be in competition in certain use cases.

Prior to the SanDisk acquisition Western Digital consistently had a higher price-earnings ratio than its closest peer Seagate. Since the acquisition Seagate has had a significantly higher price-earnings ratio. Today Western Digital has an enterprise value of $21 billion compared to the combined $34 billion pro forma enterprise value of Western Digital and SanDisk when they announced the acquisition six years ago representing $13 billion of value loss. By contrast in the same period Seagate grew its enterprise value from $17 billion to $22 billion. When Western Digital announced its acquisition of SanDisk its stock was trading at $75 per share. Six years later the stock has declined by nearly 30% to $53 per share. In the same time period the S&P 500 and Nasdaq increased by 103% and 190% respectively. Seagate (the company's closest HDD peer) has outperformed Western Digital by 278% over the last decade and Micron (its closest NAND peer) has outperformed Western Digital by 868% over the last decade.

Elliott believes that Western Digital's valuation today reflects the market's view that owning HDD and Flash together yields a clash of synergies in terms of operational and financial performance. Accordingly they are calling on the company to explore a full separation of the Flash business which they believe could lead to a stock price of $100+ per share by the end of 2023 and they illustrate the path to get there.

Western Digital's HDD business has 38% market share (versus 46% for Seagate) $9.4 billion of revenue (versus $12 billion for Seagate) 21% growth rate (versus 18% for Seagate) and both companies have a 30% gross profit margin. Using Seagate's multiples of 1.8x LTM revenue and 6.1x LTM gross profit Western Digital's HDD business would have a value of $17 billion.

Western Digital's Flash business generates $10 billion in revenue and similar businesses have been acquired at multiples of 1.7-1.9x revenue. This would attribute a minimum of a $17 billion value to the Flash business. But this is not the normal call for strategic action. Elliott is putting their money where their mouth is and offering $1+ billion of incremental equity capital into the Flash business at an enterprise value of $17 billion to $20 billion which can be utilized either in a spin-off transaction or as equity financing in a sale or merger with a strategic partner. Essentially Elliott is expressing their willingness to participate in the acquisition of the Flash business with a $1 billion investment. So Elliott sees each business valued at approximately $17 billion while the entire enterprise value of the company is $21 billion.

If Elliott does get the Flash business divested at the value they are putting their own money behind that would attribute a $4 billion valuation for the entire HDD business. There is good reason to believe that there are buyers out there for the Flash business especially with a combination of Western Digital's Flash business with its joint venture partner Kioxia. Western Digital's interest in acquiring Kioxia is well documented over the years including a proposal in 2017 and the rumored $20 billion transaction value last year (1.7x LTM revenue). In the past five years Kioxia has been publicly rumored to receive interest from a long list of other strategic and financial parties.

Their plan could resonate favorably with the company's current board and management team. The decision to acquire SanDisk predates the company's CEO David Goeckeler and his leadership team nearly all of whom were hired in 2020 or later. In fact Goeckeler's first operational move was separating HDD and Flash within Western Digital. It is not a big step to get the board to separate it into a different company particularly since only two of Western Digital's current ten directors were on the board for the SanDisk acquisition. Moreover shareholder activism is about the power of persuasion and the power of the argument and Elliott makes a very compelling argument here.

It should also be noted that Elliott reported an approximate $1 billion investment in the company but has not filed a 13D despite having a roughly 6% position. Based on their history and philosophy that is likely because Elliott is using swaps and other derivatives to build their position and those types of securities are not required to be included in ""beneficial ownership"" for the purposes of 13D filings at this time. The use of swaps in this manner is the subject of a current Securities and Exchange Commission proposal and could very well change in the short term forcing Elliott to file a 13D in this investment.

Western Digital has evidently slashed the pricing for the company's Gold Red Pro Red Plus Purple Purple Pro and Blue product lineups. However the new pricing looks skeptically low so it's likely a pricing error.

Western Digital's online store shows the WD Gold enterprise hard drives starting at $3 (down from $117.99) or the Purple surveillance hard drives at $1 (down from $83.99). Even the Red Pro and Red Plus which target NAS users carry starting prices at $10 and $27 respectively when they typically go for $209.99 and $109.99.

The manufacturer has large capacity drives including the Gold 20TB at $150 (down from $679.99) and Red Pro 20TB at $75 (down from $599.99). But unfortunately neither hard drive is stock. Moreover none of the discounted units are available for purchase suggesting that it could be a pricing error. Western Digital offers the option to notify the consumer when the hard drives are back in stock but they probably won't retain the low pricing.

It appears that only Western Digital's SATA-based hard drives show these low prices. The pricing for the brand's SSDs portable hard drives and Ultrastar hard drives remain the same.

The lower prices are only on Western Digital's U.S. store as the other regional stores show regular pricing. Unfortunately we haven't seen any reports of a successful purchase. At any rate we'll keep our eyes peeled to see whether Western Digital restocks the low-priced drives and if they fix the pricing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5lb3dpbi5uZXQvbmV3cy93ZXN0ZXJuLWRpZ2l0YWwtcHJpY2luZy1lcnJvci1oYWQtaGFyZC1kcml2ZXMtc2VsbGluZy1mb3ItanVzdC0xLTMtNS0xMC1hbmQtbW9yZS_SAWxodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZW93aW4ubmV0L2FtcC93ZXN0ZXJuLWRpZ2l0YWwtcHJpY2luZy1lcnJvci1oYWQtaGFyZC1kcml2ZXMtc2VsbGluZy1mb3ItanVzdC0xLTMtNS0xMC1hbmQtbW9yZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Western Digital pricing error had hard drives selling for just $1 $3 $5 $10 and more,"When you purchase through links on our site we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works

Western Digital (WD) which is one of the biggest and best manufacturers of storage devices in the world was selling hard disk drives (HDDs) on its own website for as little as just $1. Yes you read that part right HDDs for as little as just $1. And if you think that's just a little too low for you there were other buying options too for $3 $5 and $10.

Some of these listed models here are top-notch products too. For example the $1 drive is WD Surveillance model with a 4.8 stars rating. The $5 one is an enterprise-class product in the form of the WD Gold. You can see these listings in the image below:

In fact our very own warwagon on the forums managed to place an order for 10 4TB HDDs for just $321 that's $32.10 per drive after discounts were applied.

We'll let you know if the order is honored or not.

Jokes aside the prices that were being displayed here were probably due to some error that were overlooked and the company has appeared to have fixed the bug now.

Interestingly it appears that all the super-cheap drives were actually out of stock in many places though evidently not everywhere so you may not have been able to buy them anyway even if you had tried hard. However if you seriously happen to be shopping around for some external hard drives you can have a look at this deal where a Western Digital WD_Black 5TB HDD is selling for under $100 (via Newegg) for a limited time.

In an interview this week with The Register RISC-V International CEO Calista Redmond reckons the buy-in which comes in the form of paid memberships is needed to support ongoing development of the royalty-free CPU instruction set architecture to better compete with x86 and Arm ISAs.

""We have to have a level of funding in order to operate and manage this special rodeo of ours"" she says.

Redmond an IBM veteran pitches involvement in RISC-V International which gives paying members an extra level of say in the ISA's future development as a more even playing field for tech companies than what has been allowed with proprietary ISAs namely x86 and Arm.

""What everybody gets from this is the vested collective interests of everyone involved to say 'My destiny isn't pinned to any one or five companies. Everyone's investing together therefore my level of risk is much lower'"" she says.

When Intel joined RISC-V International in February it became a premium member the top membership tier that gave the semiconductor giant a seat on the nonprofit's board and the Technical Steering Committee which determines new features and specifications for the ISA.

For those privileges Intel and the other 19 premium members each chip in an annual fee of $250000 according to the nonprofit's website.

Redmond characterizes the interest of these premier members like this:

I want to really underwrite this thing because it helps me with my own commercialization as well as builds the ecosystem that fosters continued momentum across the industry where I will find development partners customers new opportunities growing all of that stuff that makes something really strategically durable.

Besides Intel other major companies with premier memberships include Alibaba Cloud Google Huawei Unisoc Western Digital and ZTE.

The premier members also range from startups like StarFive Ventana and Micro Systems to SiFive the latter of which is hoping to go public in the next two years with a RISC-V CPU licensing business.

There are many more RISC-V International members at the ""strategic"" level which still gives them the ability to weigh in on the future development on the ISA but not at the same level as premier members.

These members which include Canonical Nvidia and Samsung pay as much as $35000 for an annual membership. Smaller organizations pay half or less.

But it's not just companies that are members. RISC-V's more than 2400 members also include universities and government-related entities.

Just last week India's government announced that it had become a premier member and revealed a RISC-V roadmap for homegrown processors.

Another significant government-related entity with premium membership is the Chinese Academy of Sciences which participates through its Institute of Software and Institute of Computing Technology. The academy is on the US Entity List of trade-restricted organizations which underlines the unique position RISC-V is in with its open-source nature amid international tensions.

But Redmond says that as with other countries such as Russia RISC-V International is ""not required to block anybody from engaging and participating"" though the organization will make changes if needed.

""If things go the way of sanctions that are heavier on a country level we may need to pivot but at this point we are abiding by things and [are] in very close contact in understanding what are other open source and global organizations doing"" she says.

CEO has nuanced view of what RISC-V's rise will look like

For member companies that have historically been associated with proprietary ISAs such as x86 or Arm Redmond tells us they are looking at RISC-V to diversify their risk. It also gives these companies another ISA to support their increasing heterogenous computing needs.

""It makes business sense to do it"" she says.

In the case of Intel Redmond thinks the x86 giant's involvement with RISC-V is helping support the company's revitalized contract manufacturing business which has vowed to make custom chips for others using x86 Arm or RISC-V ISAs as part of a larger comeback plan.

While Intel's move to support RISC-V could seen as a conflict with the semiconductor giant's traditional x86 business Redmond admits that she doesn't think RISC-V poses an existential threat.

""This isn't inside information but I'm pretty sure they're not too worried about their x86 business. I mean they've locked that in. They've got so many customers that have some millions into that already. People are not typically ripping out existing investments"" she says.

However Redmond does see an opportunity for RISC-V to win business in new and emerging workloads and she thinks over time devices and IT infrastructure will increasingly shift to the open-source ISA.

""Now one or two generations down the line as you continue to advance and evolve your portfolio I expect many of those may shift to RISC-V"" she says.

But Redmond has a more nuanced view of what a world filled with more RISC-V designs will look like. She doesn't necessarily believe x86 and Arm will fall out of fashion. Instead she suspects tech companies will increasingly see RISC-V x86 and Arm ISAs as tools within the same toolbox. This will lead to a greater mix of ISAs used in devices and IT infrastructure which is already starting to play out.

For instance Intel uses Arm core designs for some products including its Mount Evans infrastructure processing unit. AMD relies on Arm for hardware-based security within its processors and its reportedly looking at incorporating RISC-V into future products. While Nvidia is expanding its use of Arm with upcoming server CPUs it also uses RISC-V within its GPUs as does Imagination which backs the architecture.

""You start to look at technology and hardware differently as building blocks rather than a blind allegiance"" says the CEO.

RISC-V can move faster than Arm

It's important to note that RISC-V for the most part is pretty far out from powering mainstream processors in servers and PCs.

Patrick Little CEO of RISC-V designer SiFive told us in March he doesn't expect to see commercial processors using the company's designs in PCs until late 2025 and server efforts will take longer than that.

It should be noted too that Arm has only just started to become a serious contender in PCs and servers over the past couple years.

But Redmond says that Google and other so-called hyperscalers are working on RISC-V projects ""under the covers"" and pointed out that the ISA is also used in microcontrollers in storage devices from companies like Western Digital and Seagate.

She also highlights Alibaba Cloud's XuanTie RISC-V processors which have been marketed for networking devices gateways and edge servers [PDF].

Another company Esperanto Technologies is testing its 1000-core RISC-V AI chip with Samsung's IT services arm and other companies Redmond noted. We also know of another startup Ventana Micro Systems that is building RISC-V server chips.

Redmond didn't cite any examples of PC activities. We do know that SiFive launched a RISC-V development board for desktops in late 2020 for instance while Microchip offers RISC-V boards folks are recreating the TRS-80 Model 100 with a RISC-V system-on-chip... it's safe to say various projects and products are on the go.

She promises we will see more examples of RISC-V implementations of both servers and PCs later this year.

""You're going to see a laptop this year. You're going to see more datacenter implementation stories this year"" she says.

The CEO also makes a bolder promise: whereas it took Arm about 20 years to get where it is today she predicts it will take RISC-V roughly five years to make the same amount of progress. ""Where are we in the adoption curve? We're not halfway yet but we are getting there very quickly"" she says.

The caveat she adds is that the five-year timeline is an ""imprecise measurement"" as RISC-V International and its members need to fill out some additional capabilities on the instruction set side as well as software support to cover a broad spectrum of applications.

But what makes Redmond confident in RISC-V's ability to gain more traction over the next few years is the growing support the ISA has received from a plurality of organizations.

""The reason that we're getting there faster is that we have a greater shared pool of investment across the community that is driving that"" she says. ®",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vZ2ZtYWcuY29tL2Jhbmtpbmcvd29ybGRzLWJlc3QtYmFua3MtMjAyMi13ZXN0ZXJuLWV1cm9wZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,World's Best Banks 2022: Western Europe,"Digitalization investments spur growth.





Europe’s banks showed strong resilience through the ongoing pandemic pushing forward for a second year with efforts to serve retail customers and corporate clients who were coping with a range of obstacles thrown up by Covid.

Clients of all kinds became more demanding as greater implementation of digital innovations revealed vast new possibilities. Environmental social and governance issues also continued to garner attention from corporate and institutional clients as scientific warnings grew increasingly dire. The past year saw some banking-sector merger and acquisition activity as banks sorted out strategic priorities including the mega-merger of CaixaBank and Bankia.

In part as a result of the Bankia merger CaixaBank Group today serves 21 million customers through more than 5300 branches in Spain and Portugal and exceeds €680 billion ($736 billion) in assets. Our overall winner for Western Europe Caixa also retains pole position as Best Bank in Spain after a year of strong performance right across the board—from business restructuring to digital innovation.

“We successfully completed the integration of CaixaBank and Bankia while at the same time concluding a very positive year especially in the management of long-term savings” said CEO Gonzalo Gortázar at the time.

Core revenues came to €11.34 billion and pro forma recurring profit for the year was €2.42 billion. Fee and commission income climbed to €4 billion up 6.7%. CaixaBank ended 2021 with a long-term savings market share of 29.4% and assets under management total of 48.2% in the year of which 16.5% was organic growth. The Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio rose to 13.2% well over the goal of 11%-11.5%.

Caixa continues to strengthen in digital banking with the proportion of digital customers rising to 73.1%. In March the bank announced a landmark partnership with BNP Paribas 3-Step IT giving its professional clients access to innovative and sustainable IT solutions for the first time. Rated one of the world’s most sustainable banking groups in 2021 CaixaBank became one of the founding members of the Net Zero Banking Alliance.

In neighboring Portugal the winner Santander reached a million digital customers increasing 7.5% compared with 2020. Sales through digital channels represented 56% of the total up 13% over the previous year. Deposits increased by 7% off-balance sheet resources grew by 17% and the bank held onto market shares in mortgages and new corporate loans for nearly a quarter. Total income increased by 3% costs were down 5% and underlying attributable profit leapt by 42% over the previous year.

“These figures reflect the transformation that has been carried out both at an operational and commercial level with a focus on simplifying processes and technology oriented towards improving our customers’ experience and satisfaction within a new more competitive more digital context and with increasingly demanding customers” says CEO Pedro Castro e Almeida.

In Austria winner Erste Bank more than doubled its profits mainly due to sharply reduced risk costs. Operating income increased by 8.2% with net fee and commission income up 16.5% while risk costs were reduced from €1.3 billion in 2020 to €159 million. As a result net profits for the year were €1.92 billion compared to €783 million in 2020. Customer deposits were up 10.2% across core markets most strongly in Austria and the Czech Republic. With war sanctions impacting other Austrian banks Erste stated that ‘it has no direct operating subsidiaries in Russia or Ukraine and our direct exposure to these countries is negligible.”





The winner in Germany Deutsche Bank put in exceptional performance with core banking profits up by 48% to €4.8 billion before taxes. CEO Christian Sewing said: “In 2021 we increased our net profit fourfold and delivered our best result in ten years while putting almost all our expected transformation costs behind us. In addition all four core businesses performed at or ahead of our plan and our reduction of legacy assets progressed faster than expected.”

Overall revenue rose 6% to €25.4 billion. This increase in profitability ran across the business at the corporate bank where profits were up 86% while asset management nearly doubled its contribution. Deutsche Bank also reduced its leverage exposure from €72 billion in 2020 to €39 billion. Risk-weighted assets came down sharply and provisions for credit losses were 71% lower. The bank’s CET1 capital ratio stood at 13.2% at the year end.

Italy’s largest lender and our repeat winner Intesa SanPaolo has more than 20 million customers nearly 100000 employees and over 4700 branches. It takes pride in its role as a growth accelerator for the Italian economy and its growing ESG and climate initiative. Financially the bank had a particularly good end to 2021 with €1.7 billion of its total pre-tax profit of €2.2 billion coming in the last quarter. Net income for the year was up nearly 20% on a substantial increase in fee and commission income. Operating margins improved as did credit quality with over a quarter of gross NPLs removed by the year-end. The bank has strong liquidity and a solid capital position reporting a fully-loaded CET1 ratio of 12.9%.

Intesa’s profits and capital buffers may come under strain in 2022 due to its considerable exposure (estimated at €5.7 billion) to Russia and Ukraine which in a worst-case scenario could knock 1.4 percentage points off its core capital. Though the direct impacts are likely to be less than at its main rival UniCredit the knock-on effects on Italy’s economy of a prolonged war and financial sanctions would further undermine credit quality and profitability.

Our Best Bank in France is Crédit Mutuel whose strong financials underpin an equally strong commitment to the values of mutualism and staying close to its customers on a regional basis. Overall income rose by nearly 13% to €16 billion. More tellingly this was an 8.7% increase over pre-pandemic levels. Profitability rose even faster by 39% year-on-year or 11% compared to 2019. The bank increased its lending across the board with a 9% boost to mortgages and a 6.4% rise in consumer loans while income from its insurance activities and specialized business lines grew by nearly a third. With a CET1 ratio of 18.8% Crédit Mutuel is among the best capitalized financial institutions in France

Crédit Mutuel’s digital transformation gathered momentum partly in response to the pandemic. The app using the bank’s video service launched in 2020 recorded a sixfold increase and nearly 12 million electronic signatures were completed 73% more than during the first year of Covid-19. As chairman Nicolas Téry notes: “The Covid-19 crisis and its digital environmental and social impacts have transformed us. We have mobilized our forces around the principle of mutualism in evidence. The 2021 results reflect these changes.”

KBC the winner in Belgium saw group net profit up by 81% to €2.6 billion of which nearly €2 billion was generated by the bank’s domestic market where profitability nearly doubled over the previous year. Given the low net interest margins prevalent in Benelux countries KBC could pull ahead of its competitors thanks to the richer mix of fee and commission income built into its bancassurance model.

Group revenues rose by 5% with net fee and commission income up by 14% driven primarily by an increase in fees for fast-growing insurance and asset management services. At year end total assets under management amounted to €236 billion up by 12% over 2020. Management kept a lid on costs and the capital base remains robust with a fully loaded common equity ratio of 15.5%.

The winner in the Netherlands ING put in another strong performance with profit before tax up by 78% and full-year return on equity (ROE) rising to 9.2% on the back of higher fees and commissions and a substantial reduction in provisions against bad loans. The bank’s CET1 ratio strengthened to 15.9% reflecting improved risk management and adequate capital buffers.

“Looking back on 2021 I’m pleased with our performance” says ING CEO Steven van Rijswijk. “I’m encouraged by increased lending volumes and strong fee income growth in the final quarter of 2021 a sign of growing confidence in the economy as the world seeks ways to live with the coronavirus. … I’m particularly satisfied with the consistent growth we’ve recorded in our diversifying sources of income.”

ING was a front runner in the race to digitalize and now some 51% of its customers are mobile-only. The bank is investing in a seamless digital customer experience and a crucial component of its scalable technology is the ING Private Cloud (IPC).

The Best Bank in Luxembourg is Spuerkeess the largest lender in the Grand Duchy actively diversifying its financing sources by issuing securities mainly intended for institutional investors. Over the first half of 2021 this type of funding increased by 35% reflecting the appeal of a strongly capitalized bank with a CET1 ratio rising above 22%–well ahead of most competitors. The bank is expanding its lending particularly to retail and corporate projects and growth in customer deposits remains strong. Lower cost of risk and reversals of provisions made at the outset of the pandemic contributed to a 50%-plus boost to profitability over the previous year.

In Iceland winner Arion Bank ended 2021 with its core income up 14.8% while ROE rose to 13.4% on a solid operating performance. Customer loans grew by 13.8% deposits from customers increased by 15.3% and total assets were 12.0% larger. CEO Benedikt Gíslason noted: “It was a record year in mortgage lending with 211 billion Icelandic kronas [$1.6 billion] in mortgages and the bank’s mortgage portfolio grew by 85 billion kronas over the year. Assets under management increased by almost 20% to 1.35 trillion kronas at year-end.” The bank’s CET1 ratio rose to 19.6% at year end with strong liquidity maintained after dividend payment and share buybacks amounting to 31.5 billion kronas.

The Best Bank in Sweden this year Swedbank saw fee and commission income rose by 16% to record levels. Growth in mortgage volumes was sustained and the bank built on its market-leading position for new mortgage sales. Jens Henriksson president and CEO highlighted the bank’s substantial capital and liquidity position. “Swedbank stands strong in an uncertain time … The ROE was 13.2% for the full year of 2021. Our target of a 15% return remains unchanged regardless of the bank tax. Before the end of the year we will present a plan to reach the target.” The bank’s CET1 ratio at year end was 18.3%.

Our winner for Norway and Finland Nordea “wants to become the leading relationship bank in the Nordics” says their head of Personal Banking Sara Mella. Nordea President and Group CEO Frank Vang-Jensen declared himself “happy with our progress” reflecting on a milestone year in which the bank surpassed its financial targets for 2022 ahead of schedule. Operating profit was up 67% to €4.9 billion and ROE reached 11.2% well above target.

Total income from personal banking grew by 9% driven by solid mortgage activity. Finland was the star performer across the pan-Nordic bank with an 8% increase in mortgages improved net interest margins and a 14% boost to fee and commission income lifting total income by 14%.

Tighter lending margins in Norway more than offset higher mortgage volumes and a 23% rise in fees and commission driven by higher savings and investment income. Group business banking income grew by 15% with lending volumes up 6% on strong growth in Norway and Sweden. Assets under management grew by 17% reaching an all-time high.

In a joint message from Danish winner Nykredit Chair Merete Eldrup and Michael Rasmussen Group Chief Executive announced: “Despite the constant change again in 2021 Nykredit maintained its position of strength. The financial results announced today exceed our expectations and are the Nykredit Group’s best.”

The year saw strong business and customer growth at Nykredit Bank resulting in a business profit of 5.3 billion Danish krones ($770 million) in 2021 (2020: DKK3.3 billion). Assets under management grew by 39% at newly acquired Sparinvest now part of Nykredit Wealth Management. Specialist subsidiary Totalkredit increased its lending in 97 out of 98 Danish municipalities and a wave of new green investments was announced. At year end Group CET1 ratio was 20.6%.

Switzerland’s largest bank UBS remains the Best Bank having had a strong performance in 2021. Group profit leaped to $7.5 billion with sharp improvements across all divisions and while costs remain an issue the cost/income ratio of 73.6% came in under target. UBS flagship Global Wealth Management raised its profitability by 19% and contributed $4.8 billion pre-tax. The Swiss bank increased operating income by 13% to $481 million on a 5% growth in fee-generating assets but higher costs including an $85 million increase in litigation provisions against historical involvement in tax evasion for French clients.

CEO Ralph Hamers says: “We now manage $4.6 trillion in assets and during 2021 assets invested in sustainability-focus and impact strategies across the firm increased 78%” adding that “We’re adapting our coverage model to deliver more digital and scalable advice as well as bespoke solutions and we’re accelerating our technology investments while maintaining strong cost discipline.” The CET1 ratio strengthened to 15% at the year end.

Some forty different banks are within a 10-minute walk of Monte Carlo’s celebrated casino. They are practically the only branch of an international group in the country and catering exclusively to ultrarich tax exiles. Our repeat winner as Best Bank in Monaco CFM Indosuez Wealth Management is different. The principality’s leading bank’s roots go back a century to 1922 when it was created by prominent Monegasque families some of whom still hold a minority stake in the bank. It maintains five branches and serves all types of clients from private individuals and businesses to institutional clients. It is majority-owned by Crédit Agricole and its main business is providing bespoke services to international clients. Still it is also a mini-universal bank with the region’s largest dealing room. Green investment offerings support its partnership with the Oceanographic Institute of Monaco.

Liechtenstein’s banking system is similarly devoted to servicing a wealthy international clientele and our repeat winner LGT expanded its global reach through the acquisition of UBS’s wealth management business in Austria last July to be followed this year by Crestone Wealth Management Australia’s grew leading service provider for HNWIs to provide coverage of the Indo-Pacific region. LGT produced strong results with operating income up by 16% and net profits of 353 million Swiss francs ($369 million) representing a 21% increase over 2020. Assets under management grew by 19% with net inflows of 24.8 billion francs. Having established a range of sustainable solutions for its clients LGT launched its first impact fund.

The winner in Andorra is Credit Andorra which on top of strong organic growth reinforced its leading position through the acquisition of smaller local lender Valls Bank. CEO Xavier Cornella says: “[This] is a strategic operation that reinforces our growth plan and that is intended to consolidate our leadership position in Andorra and strengthen our long-term commitment to the economic and social progress of the country.” Following the acquisition and alongside the integration of GBS Finanzas Investcapital A.V. in Spain Credit Andorra Group’s business volume amounts to €23 billion well above the forecasts of the bank’s strategic plan.

Malta’s largest lender Bank of Valletta has come out of a sticky period of being hacked by cybercriminals abrupt changes in management and major litigation that is still unresolved to produce a sparkling set of figures for 2021. Profits rose fivefold to €81 million on stronger commission and net interest income. Costs remain an issue increasing by 15% though this includes a hefty increase in strategy costs disbursements for card fraud and regulatory fines. The bank embarked on a digital transformation process and is upgrading branches accordingly. However the directors recommend no final dividend be paid–possibly due to an Italian court’s judgment against Bank of Valletta requiring it to pay €363 million to bondholders of a failed ship-owner that BOV backed. The bank is appealing the outcome.

After a difficult financial decade for Greece winner Eurobank led the way in restructuring bad loans and in 2021 reduced its NPL ratio to 6.8%. Core operating profit was up 64.9% to €482 million new loan disbursements increased by €7.8 billion and customer deposits increased by €5.9 billion. The bank’s CET1 ratio rose by 60 base points year on year to 14.5%

CEO Fokion Karavias says: “As Greece exits a decade of deleveraging the economic recovery will be investment-driven and banks have a crucial role. We believe we are in a pole position to capitalize on this growth cycle. Our profitability will be based on loan growth our leading position in fee businesses cost containment with a shift from ‘run the bank’ to ‘grow the bank’ and investments both in people and systems to leverage data and digital tools.”

In December Eurobank announced that as part of its strategy to expand its international presence it had completed the acquisition of 12.6% of Hellenic Bank Cyprus’ second-largest lender and this year’s Best Bank in Cyprus. Hellenic worked hard to improve the quality of its portfolio with NPLs now at 14.5% after a program of resolution and deleveraging. Profit to end September was €21 million.

Hellenic is currently acquiring a performing loan portfolio worth €556 million from RCB Bank subject to compliance with international sanctions. CEO Oliver Gatzke comments: “In line with the bank’s strategy of growing its business in Cyprus the transaction increases the bank’s client base in business lending provides cross-selling opportunities improves its operating income through higher interest income and creates the potential for growing its non-interest income.” The bank’s CET1 ratio was 20% in the third quarter.

Bank of Ireland rebounded strongly in 2021 delivering €1.4 billion in underlying pre-tax profit on 12% income growth and a successful cost reduction program stripping out €1.65 billion of operating expenses. Asset quality improved with NPE down to 5.5%. The bank boasts a solid capital position with a CET1 ratio of 17.0%. As CEO Francesca McDonagh comments: “We grew income reduced costs for the eighth consecutive reporting period and significantly increased capital ahead of the anticipated completion of two transformational acquisitions of Davy and KBC Ireland’s portfolios.” The bank achieved an adjusted ROTE of 12.7% last year.

Our Best Bank in the United Kingdom is Lloyds whose focus on domestic individuals and business clients served it well in 2021. Net profit increased fourfold to nearly £5.9 billion ($7.6 billion) on a 9% increase in net income due to higher lending volumes and improved margins. A hefty reduction in impairment charges generated a net underlying impairment credit of £1.2 billion.

A disciplined approach kept the lid on costs with operating expenses rising just 1% overall. Strong savings demand and investment performance in insurance and wealth management produced a £7 billion boost to new open book assets under administration. A long time leader in banking IT Lloyds continued to enhance its digital capabilities with mobile app releases that nearly doubled the previous year’s usage and led to a three-fold increase in corporate clients onboarded to the new cash management and payments platform. The bank’s CET1 ratio was 17.1% at the year end."

At first glance you might think it referred to stock market fortunes but when I peer closely the sad truth behind its jagged peaks becomes clear: it traces the amount of anti-Black hate speech recorded on Twitter in the aftermath of last July’s Euro 2020 final when England lost to Italy in a nail-biting penalty shootout.

After missed penalties from three Black England players Marcus Rashford Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka racist abuse “went through the roof” says Williams. Within the hour there was an almost 700% increase in hate directed against those players. Half of the 20000 toxic tweets came from within the UK; the police made 11 arrests for hate crimes four of which have resulted in prosecutions.

In some ways this is a textbook example of a hate-filled outburst. There was a trigger event and for many offenders lots of alcohol and drugs involved. That the abuse trickled off over the following two days is also typical. But the content of the hate directed against the players was new. Alongside familiar racists slurs there was a deluge of primate emojis. Williams calls this a key shift. “We’ve never seen emojis used as features of hate speech in that way – and volume – before.”

It is no coincidence that soaring hate-crime figures are found in countries where the extreme right is rising Matthew Williams

Williams would know: he is a professor of criminology specialising in hate crimes and along with computer scientist Pete Burnap is the co-founder of the HateLab a platform that monitors hate across social media in real time. They are on the frontline of internet hate observing shifts in behaviour and figuring out who is stirring the fury. They pass their insights on to civil rights organisations governments and big tech firms who use it to inform counter-hate-speech campaigns ban users and pursue prosecutions.

An all-seeing eye for the racist misogynistic homophobic transphobic venom that humans spit at one another from behind keyboards Williams has advised everyone from Twitter Meta (formerly Facebook) Google and TikTok to the Professional Footballers Association the UK Home Office and the US Department of Justice.

The 45-year-old has also just published a book that investigates the biological and sociological reasons why people commit hate crimes. The Science of Hate asks big urgent questions: is everyone capable of hate? Is this the most hateful the world has ever been? And perhaps most importantly how can we combat it?

In recent years hate has felt omnipresent. “It is no coincidence that soaring hate-crime figures are found in countries where the extreme right is rising” writes Williams adding that “divisive messages from public figures are directly linked to tipping some people into violence on the streets.” The 2016 election of Donald Trump coincided with the biggest rise in hate crimes in the US since 9/11. And the HateLab found there were 1100 racist attacks committed in the UK as a direct result of the 2016 Brexit referendum result.

In nations with reasonable hate-crime recording standards such as the UK US and much of Europe the data points to an “upward trend” says Williams. The internet has amplified the rage by giving people a 24/7 hotline to spurt poisonous views and egg one another on. A 2021 survey found that half of all 12- to 15-year-olds in the UK had encountered hateful content online. “Left unchallenged” he writes “the expression of hate… has the potential to become more widespread than at any other point in history.”

Yet Williams is no doomster. With neatly combed hair a gently lilting Welsh accent and an easy laugh he is a surprisingly cheery character given his line of work. He does however want to awaken us to the fact that “everyone” has prejudices – “You can say you don’t but you’re lying” – and under the right mix of circumstances has the potential to slide towards hateful behaviour.

It’s a sobering thought in a woke era in which we’re loath to admit any prejudices. But it’s intended as a rallying cry. Being mindful of our own prejudices helps us keep them in check – and understanding how biases work better equips us to de-fang those who peddle hate especially online.

“To keep my faith in humanity I have to constantly remind myself that the majority are not hateful” says Williams. “What I hope for is for more of these good citizens to stand up to hatred when they see it instead of scrolling or walking on.”

Williams who is gay knows full well how damaging a hate crime can be. In 1998 when he was 20 he was beaten up by three men after leaving a gay bar in London. Their punches were punctuated by snickering and homophobic slurs. The attack shook him. “I couldn’t get it out of my head: it filled my thoughts until there was no room for anything else” he says. Even today he won’t hold his husband’s hand in public for fear of being targeted. “It’s stayed with me for a long long time.”

It also shaped his career prompting the then-aspiring journalist to switch to criminology. A key thrust behind the book was to find out what made his attackers do what they did that day. “There’s this notion that all hate crime offenders are monsters beyond understanding and that if you dare to try to understand them you humanise them or in some way provide an excuse for their behaviour” he says. “I wanted to find something that really separated me from my attackers something that was unique about them – and different from me.”

Instead his findings showed that he and his attackers were in all likelihood “remarkably similar in our biology and psychology”. The common core? An innate human desire to be part of a group and to favour people we perceive to be like us. Such “groupishness” is an evolutionary trait: huddling with others increases our chance of survival. And it means that from a young age we instinctively view the world through the lens of our group and other folks: “us” and “them”.

Our behaviour towards “others” occupies a spectrum with unconscious bias at one end prejudice in the middle and hate at the other extreme. Whereas prejudiced behaviour means avoiding others hateful acts seek them out in order to hurt them. There’s often a twisted moral element to hate too with offenders claiming that the victim’s group are an affront to their way of life.

Neuroscientific studies suggest bias is mapped on to our brains: the amygdala a “fast but dumb” threat detector in our temporal lobe as Williams puts it often sounds an alarm when it registers someone who is not like us. The smarter prefrontal cortex then overrules it when it realises there is nothing to worry about (most studies on this relate to race). But research suggests certain individuals can develop an oversized amygdala and a weak executive control centre meaning they instinctively overreact to threats and then have no reasoning function to calm things down. Statistically hate offenders are most likely to be young men (and in western countries white). Williams imagines them to be “fearful angry and powerless”.

Traumatic childhoods often set them apart. Many grew up with abusive or absent parents and experienced personal losses homelessness drug addictions or other traumas that left them emotionally unstable. “Childhood scars can thwart psychological development to a point where normal coping mechanisms are either malfunctioning or absent” he writes.

Williams cites a study from the University of Manchester involving in-depth interviews with 15 young white British men convicted of racial violence. When stressed or triggered they took out their frustrations on ethnic minorities who they “saw as having less power than them” he writes. “Race hate provided a convenient home… for their unresolved frustrations from past trauma.” The racial “other” was an easy target: hate almost always involves punching down. (For the most extreme type of hate criminal a “mission offender” eliminating other groups is seen as serving a higher purpose. Examples include suicide bombers; the 1999 London nailbomber who targeted gay black and Bengali communities; and Joseph Paul Franklin a KKK member who during the 1970s and 80s killed more than 20 black people.)

While it’s human nature to classify “us” and “them” how those lines are drawn is – at least theoretically – not fixed. “Evolution tells us that we’re not inherently racist or biased against a religion or a sexual orientation” says Williams. That certain groups are consistently targeted for hate is a product of social forces: it is shaped by what we see in the media what our parents tell us and who we interact with growing up (children who attend mixed-race schools before the age of 12 are less likely to possess race-related bias). And new battle lines are constantly being drawn. Covid has pitted vaxxers and anti-vaxxers against one another seen a spike in anti-Asian hate crimes and resulted in experts and even the NHS becoming targets of derision.

The unique dynamics of social media can spur people into hateful outbursts. Filter bubbles and algorithms reinforce and deepen prejudices while anonymous accounts reduce accountability. When sparked by an event – whether political vote terror attack or football game – some users temporarily lose their ability to suppress their ingrained biases and take to their keyboards as the mask of civility slips. In what’s known as a “cascade” effect they’re encouraged by the rush of others doing the same and the perception that “such actions have little or no consequence” says Williams who is currently busy monitoring a prolonged wave of hate speech against Russians in the wake of the Ukraine invasion.

The most common target for online hate? Women. “Misogyny is always the most prevalent category on social media: it’s a huge problem” says Williams. Its rifeness is partly attributable to the fact that women account for half the population (most other hate victims are minorities) so there are lots of targets and to a culture of misogyny that festers among “incels” and other all-male communities. Misogyny would probably attract the highest number of hate-crime prosecutions – if it were in fact a hate crime.

In the UK’s hate crime legislation sex and gender are not recognised as protected characteristics so a judge is not compelled to consider misogyny as an aggravating factor in sentencing and police are not required to record it as a hate statistic. Just this February MPs rejected a proposal to add it as a category due to concerns it could complicate domestic violence and rape prosecutions. “Because there’s no sort of legal framework there [anti-women online hate] is probably not policed to any great extent – not in the same way anti-black or anti- Muslim or anti-gay rhetoric would be” says Williams.

Who should be accountable for stamping out hate is a thorny issue. While governments and police should be responsible for dealing with the most serious offences in many places – including the US but not the UK – hate crimes are woefully under-reported. This is a combination says Williams of a lack of police resources (investigating hate crimes requires considerable effort) and lack of trust in police by the most vulnerable members of society.

Online big tech clearly has a role to play in monitoring content on their sites and banning users who go too far. But sifting through the millions of posts requires vast resources and as Williams puts it “There’s no money in stopping hate.” There’s no thriving marketplace for services that track hate speech and coordinate anti-hate campaigns meaning organisations doing these things are chronically underfunded and rely on support from government and charities to survive (HateLab is mostly funded by the UK’s Economic and Social Research Council and the Alfred Landecker Foundation).

By contrast “There seems to be more profit in generating hate and keeping people on social media by engaging with it” says Williams. As is shown by YouTube’s famously addictive algorithm which draws viewers deeper down a rabbit hole by suggesting ever more extreme content “hate is sticky”. It’s like not being able to avert your eyes from a car crash. Even so Williams is optimistic that an anti-hate crusade could bear fruit for businesses concerned with bottom lines. “Can you imagine if you could say your platform was free of hate speech?” he says. “How great would that be for the company – but also the profits!”

Rather than relying on the likes of Mark Zuckerberg Williams thinks we’re best placed to take on the responsibility ourselves. First we need to learn the art of neutralising hate speech. Our instinct says Williams is “to go in all guns blazing and attack the hate speaker with equally offensive speech sometimes” which – surprise surprise – escalates the situation. By contrast calmly challenging the logic of their claims has proven success.

“If they say ‘All Muslims are terrorists’ you say ‘Hang on a second. Don’t you think that if every Muslim was a terrorist we’d have a lot more terror attacks right now? Because there’s X many Muslims living in this place.’”

The quick-witted among us will be pleased to hear that humour and parody can be handy too. “Engaging in a lighthearted way and maybe being a bit sarcastic to highlight the inconsistency of their argument can help – the [hate makers] start to interact a bit more” he says. And coordinated efforts whereby a group of users are “singing from the same hymn sheet” are far more effective than solo missions (a catchy hashtag can help engender a sense of solidarity). Such things need to be taught in schools he says. “We don’t have any solid educational guidance on what the best counter speech is.”

Combining this knowledge with an eagle eye we need to start shutting down bile whenever we see it and taking control of our online spaces. Williams has seen examples of this done with success in the past such as the “safety pin” campaign in the aftermath of Brexit whereby “every time someone said something racist a bunch of people would descend on it using the safety-pin hashtag and standing up for migrants.”

Williams views Wikipedia as an unlikely North Star. “It’s a self-regulating system: people pull up information if it’s false members of the community flag it and get rid of it. They set their standards of operation.” He’s hopeful that we can turn our online spaces into “more mature” places if counter speakers engage with hate speakers in a sustained coordinated drive. And en masse. “That I think will change how these platforms look.”

It’s not rocket science but it does require a conscious effort. Start by looking at your own prejudices. Then armed with a calm mind and perhaps a quip or two pull up your Twitter Instagram and TikTok feed. And then you anti-hate hounds get sniffing.

Two generations of University of Southern California quarterbacks have teamed up to establish an NFT platform for student-athletes to capitalize on their name image and likeness. Matt Leinart a 2004 Heisman Trophy winner for USC and 2021 Freshman All-American Caleb Williams have teamed up to launch Hall of GOATs to help empower student-athletes at all levels to create their personal brands through a digital marketplace.

The newest NIL platform will partner directly with student-athletes to help them establish and execute their personal brand strategy for long term success. It will also allow collectors and fans to easily access and engage with their favorite amateur athletes and will offer limited edition merchandise autographed memorabilia tickets to events and exclusive conversations with athletes.

“There is a new generation of athlete today that has the power and ownership potential of their future on and off the field” said Leinart the two-time National Champion and College Football Hall of Famer. “Hall of GOATs’ mission is to empower collegiate and high school athletes to further take control of their own brands and build a legacy that extends well beyond the playing field.”

The platform will offer digital collectibles highlighting the student-athlete’s personality on and off the field. The collectibles will feature memorable athletic performances but they will also include personal stories interests passions and other significant off court moments.

“I’ve been trying to figure out how to get into the digital collectible and NFT space for some time now” added the sophomore-to-be Trojans quarterback Williams. “But not until I joined the Hall of GOATs team have I seen a platform that helps amateur athletes in particular build their brands tell their stories and set them up for long term success. It’s always been my goal to do something that could help my teammates and other athletes in this new space of college sports. I feel like Hall of GOATS can do just that.”

Hall of GOATs will serve both high school and collegiate athletes. It will partner with top-level providers including design and production companies gaming and streaming activations and other brand collaborations. Also it specifically plans to integrate the collectibles on the new Metaverse.

The vast majority of athletes will not continue to play professionally. Hall of GOATs recognizes that reality and is focused on helping athletes create long term success with a digital marketplace.

“98.5% of amateur athletes don’t go pro” said Hall of GOATs CEO Greig Carlson a former USC wide receiver. “I went from being a walk-on to earning a scholarship on a National Championship-winning team but was out of the sport just as quickly. Hall of GOATs will help athletes at all levels build their communities while navigating the NIL landscape to set them up for success even after they hang up their cleats or sneakers.”

Built on the NEAR protocol – a certified carbon-neutral blockchain – and accepting credit and debit cards Hall of GOATs is focused on sustainability and accessibility for all levels of collectors and fans to participate and engage.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA1LzA4L3dhbnQtNzUwMC1pbi1hbm51YWwtZGl2aWRlbmQtaW5jb21lLWludmVzdC0xMDEwMDAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Want $7500 in Annual Dividend Income? Invest $101000 in These Ultra-High-Yield Energy Stocks,"These passive income powerhouses sport an average yield of 7.45%!

While there are a number of moneymaking investing strategies buying dividend stocks just might be the best.

Back in 2013 J.P. Morgan Asset Management a division of money-center bank JPMorgan Chase issued a report comparing the performance of companies that initiated and grew their payouts to publicly traded companies that didn't pay a dividend. Over a 40-year stretch (1972-2012) the dividend stocks mopped the floor with the non-dividend payers: 9.5% annualized return vs. 1.6% annualized return.

Because income stocks are often profitable and time-tested they're just the types of businesses we'd expect to increase in value over time. In other words it's not a matter of if dividend stocks can make you money -- it's determining which dividend stocks to buy.

If steady annual dividend income that can put inflation in its place is what you're after ultra-high-yield energy stocks could be your answer. The following three passive income juggernauts average a 7.45% yield which means you can generate $7500 in annual income by investing roughly $101000 (split equally).

Enterprise Products Partners: 6.9% yield

The first energy powerhouse that can help investors rake in the cash while taming historically high inflation is oil and gas stock Enterprise Products Partners (EPD -0.07%). Though its 6.9% yield is the low-water mark on this list the company has raised its base annual payout in each of the past 23 years.

For some investors the idea of putting their money to work in oil stocks may not be appealing. Just 25 months ago the energy sector was in a state of shock as the COVID-19 pandemic led to global lockdowns and a cratering in crude oil demand. In fact West Texas Intermediate futures briefly hit negative $40 a barrel.

But EPD (I'm referring to Enterprise Products Partners' ticker symbol here as an abbreviation for the company) is an entirely different beast. Whereas drillers and explorers were pummeled by the historic demand drawdown EPD was fine. That's because it's an integrated midstream company. In plainer terms it's an energy middleman. It controls more than 50000 miles of transmission pipeline has 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage capacity operates 23 natural gas processing facilities and manages 19 deepwater docks handling natural gas liquids.

The beauty of the midstream operating model is very simple: it's predictable. Utilizing volume-based commitments from drillers EPD is able to forecast its annual cash flow with incredible accuracy. This is important as it allows the company to outlay capital for new infrastructure as well as make acquisitions. EPD currently has 10 major infrastructure projects under construction totaling $4.6 billion. All but two of these projects will be fully operational within the next 20 months.

If you need even more convincing consider this: At no point during the pandemic did Enterprise Products Partners' distribution coverage ratio fall below 1.6. The ""distribution coverage ratio"" describes the amount of distributable cash flow from operations relative to what was paid to shareholders. A figure below 1 would imply an unsustainable payout. With EPD nowhere near this danger zone and oil and gas prices now soaring it's safe to say this supercharged payout is rock-solid.

Alliance Resource Partners: 7.14% yield

A second ultra-high-yield energy stock that can help income seekers generate $7500 in annual payouts is coal producer Alliance Resource Partners (ARLP -2.35%). Following its recent 40% quarterly dividend hike Alliance Resource Partners is parsing out a 7.1% yield.

As recently as the fourth quarter of 2020 coal stocks were a dumpster fire -- and that's putting it nicely. Between July 2018 and August 2020 coal price per ton plummeted almost 60%. Weakened demand from COVID-19 coupled with supply chain challenges and labor shortages proved to be a perfect storm for much of the industry. At one point even Alliance Resource Partners was forced to shelve its dividend due to economic uncertainty.

But that's all a distant memory. Historically high commodity inflation has sent the per-ton coal price up 600% since August 2020 (and that's after a modest pullback). With management expecting high inflation and robust coal prices to persist throughout 2022 the company aims to increase its distribution by 10% to 15% per quarter for the remainder of the year. If its share price were to stay the same income investors would be looking at a yield of around 10% or possibly higher.

What makes Alliance Resource Partners tick is its forward-thinking management team. Well over 90% of 2022's estimated coal production is already spoken for via volume and price commitments. Further around 55% of next year's output if similar to 2022 is locked in. During the first quarter the company booked commitments all the way out to 2025. Similar to EPD this is a way for Alliance Resource Partners to maintain a transparent outlook for its operating cash flow.

In addition to its coal operations the company also has oil and gas royalty interests. Without getting too deep into the weeds the higher oil and natural gas prices head the likelier it is that Alliance Resource Partners will recognize more adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) from this royalty segment. During the first quarter the company's adjusted EBITDA from its oil and gas segment rose 139% from the prior-year period.

After years of underperformance things couldn't be any better for Alliance Resource Partners.

Antero Midstream: 8.31% yield

The third ultra-high-yield energy stock that can bring in the green and crush inflation is midstream natural gas operator Antero Midstream (AM 0.49%). Among the three stocks listed here Antero's 8.31% yield is the highest.

Similar to EPD Antero Midstream benefits from the predictability of the contracts it signs with parent company Antero Resources (AR 0.03%). The former provides gathering compressing processing and water delivery for the latter. Knowing well in advance how much operating cash flow the company can expect in a given year allows Antero Midstream to outlay capital for new infrastructure projects without compromising its profitability or distribution.

Interestingly Antero Midstream slashed its quarterly distribution by 27% last year. I say ""interestingly"" because the price for natural gas had improved significantly from the previous year and the company had no trouble covering its distribution. However there's a very good reason for this reduction.

Parent company Antero Resources plans to increase its drilling on Antero Midstream's acreage. The latter purposefully reduced its dividend to shift additional capital to new infrastructure projects through the midpoint of the decade. In announcing the move Antero Midstream estimated that it would generate $400 million in incremental free cash flow by 2025. The company is effectively trading a small amount of near-term distributions to generate significantly more operating cash flow over the long run.

One reason to make this move is that it'll likely help push Antero Midstream's share price higher. Even though I'm pounding the table on the yields for these passive income juggernauts their valuations can easily expand over time.

We’ve all heard of right to education --- but right to nap? Earlier this week Chaitanya Ramalingegowda co-founder of home and sleep solutions brands Wakefit  announced just that: a first-of-its-kind right to nap initiative to promote and normalise afternoon naps at work. As people took to LinkedIn to laud the move the startup’s social media handle quipped: ‘Miles to go but before that we sleep’.In a post-Covid-19 world where employees are demanding more work-life balance more flexibility and a better more inclusive workplace culture startups such as Wakefit Dream11  The Good Glamm Group BeatO and Zepto are stepping up with initiatives to keep employees happy at a time when attrition is high and competition intense to attract the right talent.From nap times to birthday leaves and vacation reimbursements chatbots that connect with employees to gauge how they are feeling to employee-driven benefits programmes startups are going the extra mile to change how staid old corporate culture works.“Initiatives like this have a compounding effect. Anyone alone won’t be a retention tool; but they all add up” Ramalingegowda told ET.“It’s about constantly pushing the envelope. If it resonates great; otherwise we phase it out” he says.The emergence of multiple new opportunities for talented employees coupled with a weakened emotional bond between employees and the organisation due to long duration of WFH has resulted in high attrition“To manage this situation organisations are taking a multiprong approach. They have become very innovative in customising their benefits to position themselves uniquely in front of employees to ensure a stronger connect” says Rajul Mathur Head of talent & Rewards Willis Towers Watson.Fantasy sports platform Dream11 had earlier introduced the Proximity to Stadium benefits programme to encourage employees to move closer to The Stadium (the office) by contributing up to Rs 1 lakh every month towards HRA. More recently it offered an instant relocation policy when it anticipated the end of pandemic-related restrictions. Under this new and current Dreamsters could move back to Mumbai with their families and their end-to-end relocation including accommodation in five-star hotels for up to three weeks was paid for.“This policy is among the top reasons why more than 2/3rds of Dreamsters who were already availing the Proximity to Stadium benefit resumed work with us full time in February. We believe that our culture and the way we work are huge motivators for our talent to be with us in the long run” said CHRO Kevin Freitas.Other startups are trying different things. Like The Good Glamm Group has done away with the attendance system. About a month ago it introduced the Amber chatbot to put in place a continuous listening mechanism where it connects with employees on how they're feeling whether they're burnt out etc. “Amber has been working very well for us as a retention tool because it helps us identify which employees are disengaged. In a sense we're able to do 'stay interviews' rather than 'exit interviews’” says chief people officer Kartik Rao.Grocery startup Zepto recently carried out a survey asking employees what they want in terms of benefits and then rolled out a benefits programme including multiple options to allow employees to curate what works for them. “The intent was to ensure that the benefits eventually matter and help each of our employees"" said CHRO Roma Bindroo. This week they are rolling out a vacation reimbursement under which all employees will be encouraged to take a few days off and be reimbursed for it.Health startup BeatO has recently rolled out individual 1:1 employee meetings with the founders to provide employees a platform to voice/communicate their issues and have them resolved said HR head Sugandha Jain.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But just the pools themselves were open absent the wild party scenes (or with toned-down parties at best).

But this year the parties are back in full force. Gone are restrictions that allow only hotel guests to use a casino pool and many are now open to the public for swimming or partying — but be prepared to pay for the privilege. These pools will be hopping all summer long as part of Las Vegas’ vibrant “daylife” scene: Aliante Aria Bally’s Circa Cosmopolitan Downtown Grand Encore Flamingo Golden Nugget Green Valley Ranch JW Marriott Luxor Mirage M Resort Mandalay Bay MGM Grand Park MGM Planet Hollywood Red Rock Resorts World Sahara Sunset Station The Cromwell The LINQ Tropicana Venetian and Virgin. If you don’t see your resort on the list don’t worry. All the casinos have pools for their guests they just aren’t all open to the public.

Toptional: This year six Las Vegas pools are classified as “toptional” meaning topless sunbathing is allowed (if not encouraged) — Artisan Encore (XS) The STRAT (Wet24) Mandalay Bay (Moorea) Mirage (Bare) and Wynn (Sunset). Most charge admission fees for nonhotel guests.

Blackjack: If you want to play live blackjack by the pool there are six casinos to choose from: Cosmopolitan Encore Flamingo Golden Nugget Mandalay Bay and Tropicana (swim-up blackjack coming soon).

Question: What’s being built in the corner of the CityCenter complex on the south Strip?

Answer: It’s a four-story retail center tentatively called Project63. The topping off ceremony took place last month one year to the day after the close of the sale by MGM Resorts of the two-acre property previously occupied by the failed Harmon condo tower. Project63 is on schedule to welcome its first tenants in October with the complex completely built out by February.

The pair were hard at work filming the show on their 25th wedding anniversary.

Tim McGraw and Faith Hill got the chance to act together when they were cast in Taylor Sheridan’s Yellowstone prequel 1883. However the husband and wife’s time filming the show was anything but a walk in the park. The 1883 cast endured some pretty harsh conditions while filming the series. McGraw and Hill were even put to work on their 25th wedding anniversary.

‘1883’ star Tim McGraw recounts proposing to Faith Hill

Tim McGraw and Faith Hill recently celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary. The pair have spent a quarter of a century together and are raising three children. However McGraw recalled that Hill didn’t say yes to his proposal right away.

“We had dated for a while. I actually asked her to marry me quite a few times and she kept saying no” he stated in a Twitter video. “She said ‘I’m not going to get involved with another country singer it’s just not going to work out.'” Then one day Hill and McGraw were at a country music festival.

“They had these trailer houses set up. I’m getting ready to go on stage and I had this sort of case that had this big mirror in it” he recounted. McGraw asked Hill to marry him once again before he had to get onstage.

25 years later and it's still the best day of my life. Thanks for going on this journey with me. Love you @FaithHill ❤️ pic.twitter.com/DmxXCDnOH3 — Tim McGraw (@TheTimMcGraw) October 6 2021

“I came off the stage and went back into my dressing room and Faith wasn’t there but I looked at the mirror. In lipstick it said ‘Yes! I’m gonna be your wife'” the singer said. “And we still have that mirror. And it was the best day of my life that’s for sure.”

McGraw and Hill were filming ‘1883’ on their 25th wedding anniversary

Years later McGraw and Hill were selected to portray James and Margaret Dutton in Taylor Sheridan’s Yellowstone prequel 1883. The series follows the story of the 19th century Duttons as they embark on the treacherous journey from Texas to Montana in the hopes of a better life.

Filming 1883 certainly wasn’t a walk in the park for the cast of the show. “I remember we were sitting on our patio and I looked at Faith and I told her ‘Once we sign [the contract] we are no longer the boss anymore. We’re hired help'” McGraw told NPR. “‘It’s going to be really hard work.’ And it was: It was 14-hour days six days a week and we probably got three hours of sleep a night.”

“I grew up in Louisiana and my step dad was a cowboy so I could ride before I could walk” McGraw said. “But the wagon driving was something completely different. I’d never done that before and Faith had to do that the most.”

McGraw recalled one scene that stands out in his memory: “[Faith] was driving that wagon across the river and it was probably 36 degrees out freezing cold. I was up to … my waist and on the horse in water. And it was probably 3:30 in the morning and it was our 25th wedding anniversary when we did that scene.”

‘1883’ has been renewed for additional episodes

1883 aired its finale on Feb. 27 but the story doesn’t end there. Paramount ordered more episodes of the prequel series though there won’t technically be an 1883 Season 2. The additional episodes of 1883 are anticipated to air some time this fall. Although there is not an official cast list yet it seems more than likely that Tim McGraw and Faith Hill will return.

All episodes of 1883 are currently streaming on Netflix.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9vdGhlci1zcG9ydHMvbW1hL2Nvbm9yLW1jZ3JlZ29yLW5ldC13b3J0aC11ZmMtMjY5MDQ2NjDSAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy5taXJyb3IuY28udWsvc3BvcnQvb3RoZXItc3BvcnRzL21tYS9jb25vci1tY2dyZWdvci1uZXQtd29ydGgtdWZjLTI2OTA0NjYwLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Conor McGregor backed to become billionaire before UFC star's own deadline,"UFC star McGregor has been backed by US Sports analyst Andrew Petcash to become a billionaire this year - in advance of the Irishman's own deadline

Conor McGregor has been backed to become a billionaire by the end of the year - several months ahead of his original prediction.

The UFC superstar was the highest earning sportsperson in 2021 having generated earnings of around $180 million from his successful fighting career and other business ventures.McGregor's revenue was largely generated by the recent $150m sale of his whiskey brand Proper Twelve to Proximo Spirits.

And sports entrepreneur Petcash has delivered a bold prediction of the Irishman's future new net worth tweeting: "" Conor McGregor will be a [dollar] billionaire this year (earning) $235m from fighting and a $600m deal [from] the ring. McGregor makes a lot from fighting. A study by OLBG found that he makes over $8m for every minute in the octagon.

“McGregor made $158m last year – it’s the most ever by an athlete. McGregor invested in his own fitness program FAST a program (that) helps users get into fighting shape. Last year it did $5m in revenue. August McGregor his fashion and lifestyle line created alongside A-list tailor David Heil makes luxury suits for the likes of Elon Musk. Around $50m/year in profits is created by this menswear brand.

""Conor McGregor excels equally at business and sport. In his words fighting is his 'third income'. With his smart business moves he is all set to achieve his personal goal of becoming a billionaire by the time he is 35.""

With his fortune continuing to soar McGregor previously predicted to ESPN that he would be a billionaire by the time he turns 35 next summer. But as he has done in his fighting career the UFC star is set to break boundaries and reach the net worth milestone at the age of 34

Petcash went on to list McGregor's endorsements including Reebok Burger King Beats by Dre and Wynn Resorts in addition to his mega-money fight with Floyd Mayweather which is expected to have generated the Irishman a purse of around $100m due to it's monumental success.

McGregor is also expected to have a ""huge acquisition on the horizon"" just days after collecting his new plush £2.6m Lamborghini yacht which joins a whole fleet of luxury vehicles worth an estimated £2.5m. The 33-year-old has also recently been splashing the cash on several luxury holidays and has been partying during his down-time as he plots a UFC comeback.

Despite the majority of his earnings coming from outside the octagon in recent times McGregor generated a lucrative £40m from his two exploits with Dustin Poirier last year making him the highest-paid in the promotion. He even claimed that he would be able to afford to table a bid to buy Chelsea Football Club after the Blues were put up for sale for a value of £3billion by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdW5kYXl3b3JsZC5jb20vc2hvd2Jpei9jb25vci1tY2dyZWdvci13aWxsLWJlLWEtZG9sbGFyLWJpbGxpb25haXJlLWJlZm9yZS1oaXMtdGFyZ2V0LWFnZS1vZi0zNS1leHBlcnQtY2xhaW1zLzQxNjI1MDQ0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Conor McGregor will be a 'dollar billionaire' before his target age of 35 expert claims,"'McGregor makes a lot from fighting.

Conor McGregor is set to achieve his personal goal of becoming a billionaire by the time he is 35-years-old a top US sports analyst has claimed.

In 2020 the now 33-year-old fighter told ESPN he believed he would be a billionaire by the time he's 35.

However he looks set to beat his own prediction by at least a year as it looks like he will break into the billionaire bracket as he turns 34 in July.

Andrew Petcash a sports entrepreneur and former Division 1 basketball player at Boston University detailed how the Notorious is about to turn the major financial corner in a series of tweets.

A former athlete himself Petcash created the Petcash Post a newsletter that “breaks down the business of athletes & sports"" which is “read daily by athletes coaches sports professionals and fans”.

Just last week McGregor took ownership of his new 63-foot-long Lamborghini Technomar

In the first tweet Petcash declares: “Conor McGregor will be a billionaire this year (earning) $235m from fighting and a $600m deal off the ring.

He adds: “McGregor makes a lot from fighting. A study by OLBG found that he makes over $8m for every minute in the octagon.

""Billed as ‘The Money Fight’ the Dubliner took on Floyd Mayweather in what was the second most watched fight of all-time” Petcash reports. “The duo pocketed $400M combined.

“Conor also known as ‘Notorious’ is a huge asset to advertisers"" Petcash states and then lists his endorsements that include Reebok DraftKings Burger King Beats by Dre Wynn Resorts Roots of Fight MonsterEnergy and EA (Electronic Arts).

“McGregor made $158m last year - it's the most ever by an athlete” he adds.

“McGregor invested in his own fitness program FAST a program (that) helps users get into fighting shape. Last year it did $5m in revenue.

“August McGregor his fashion and lifestyle line created alongside A-list tailor David Heil makes luxury suits for the likes of Elon Musk. Around $50m/year in profits is created by this menswear brand” Petcash tweets adding “a huge acquisition is on the horizon.

“The Mac Life Conor's media house has 1.2m subscribers on YouTube. The Mac Life primarily covers MMA sports lifestyle and fitness (and) early every video gets six figure views bringing in $1000's of ad revenue.”

He also refers Proper No 12 Conor’s whiskey brand that had $1bn in sales in its first year of launch.

“In April 2021 McGregor sold his majority stake to Proximo Spirits for $600m” Petcash adds. “He is estimated to have made a whopping $150m from this deal.”

As well as his big earnings Petcash highlights McGregor's philanthropy.

“Conor may be notorious in the ring but he's generous in the community adding: “Donated $1m for families of deceased first responders. Built houses for the homeless in Dublin. Donated $1.4m in PPE kits to healthcare workers in Ireland.

“With his smart business moves he is all set to achieve his personal goal of becoming a billionaire by the time he is 35.”

McGregor is not shy about splashing his cash.

Just last week he took ownership of his new 63-foot-long Lamborghini Technomar nicknamed the “supercar of the sea” after seven months of waiting for the vessel to be ready.

Estimated to cost in the region of €3 million McGregor previously referred to 4000-horsepowered dual engine twin turbo “rocket ship” as the best purchase he has ever made.

“I am honoured to secure the Number 12 edition of just 63 to be made” he revealed on Instagram last year. “1963 being the year Lamborghini first began and 12 being well you know Twelve

When later asked by MMA journalist Aaron Bronsteter what was the best purchase he ever made McGregor said: “I would say my Lamborghini yacht.

“It's some vessel so I'm really excited to get into it and rally it around. I look forward to setting records on it also.

McGregor also has a collection cars including a luxury Rolls Royce worth more than €435000 that was seen most recently in Temple Bar.

The Notorious rocked up outside The Porterhouse and Roberta’s on Parliament Street and shared a photo of his black Rolls Royce Phantom VIII on the cobblestoned paths.

A grey Range Rover Sport worth around €87400 can also be spotted in the photo parked behind the Rolls Royce.

McGregor of course also famously purchased the Black Forge Inn in Dublin 12 for €2m in 2020 and later spent a further €1m renovating the pub

He also recently secured planning permission with 10 planning conditions attached by the council for the scheme which will see it expanded at the rear of the venue.

In May of last year it was reported how a record four athletes had each earned $100 million or more in the previous 12 months.

According to data from Forbes MMA star McGregor topped the list of the world's 10 highest-earning athletes having made $180 million in 2020.

“This is the 32-year-old's first time in the No. 1 slot -- and it isn't just because of his fighting earnings"" it was reported.

To do that the state will need the infrastructure to transport power from wind and solar installations in southeast New Mexico across the state.

That’s why the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) was studying the environmental impact of the proposed SunZia Southwest Transmission Project and amendments the agency approved in 2015.

The project would see two 500 kilovolt transmission lines carrying up to 4500 megawatts of electricity mostly from renewable sources from rural New Mexico to homes and businesses in the two states to the west.

Sign up for our newsletter the Daily Briefing to get stories like this one delivered straight to your inbox every morning.

It would travel 520 miles across state federal and private lands bolstering the market for New Mexico’s wind and solar power as production grows amid a statewide push to decarbonize its energy sectors.

The BLM on April 29 released a draft environmental impact statement for the SunZia project opening a 60-day public comment period running until July 28.

Public meetings were also planned to be scheduled this year per a BLM news release to solicit more feedback on the project.

Here’s what we know about the proposal’s latest form and how New Mexicans can participate in the process.

Why is the SunZia project needed?

New Mexico’s renewable energy sector is growing quickly as Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham since taking office in 2019 sought to increase the state’s renewable energy portfolio.

That meant several large-scale wind and solar projects were being built throughout the state and utility providors like Xcel Energy made commitments to decarbonize their operations entirely in the coming years and decades.

Records from the New Mexico State Land Office showed there were 16 active leases for wind power projects in the state representing 619 megawatts of total capacity.

But the 12 lease applications the Land Office had on file records show would more than quadruple the capacity to add 2570 megawatts to New Mexico’s wind power generation.

Solar power was poised for similar growth with 35 lease applications on file records show for 3146 megawatts of added capacity to join just 303 megawatts on 11 active leases.

More:Oil industry urges support from Biden as energy costs soar in the wake of Russia conflict

That’s a lot of growth in both wind and solar and the SunZia would act as a conduit to export all that energy out of New Mexico to larger urban markets in Arizona and California.

Where will the transmission lines start and where will they end?

SunZia’s route begins at a substation in Torrance County where power is sent from wind turbines and solar panels then traverses Lincoln Socorro Sierra Luna Grant and Hidalgo counties in New Mexico.

It crosses into Arizona and heads through Graham Greenlee Conchise Pima and Pinal counties in Arizona where it terminates at another substation and can then be connected to other transmission systems for further exportation.

What are the proposed amendments to the project?

There are four components of the SunZia’s route that were proposed to be altered by the BLM avoiding environmental impacts and interactions with other federal or state lands.

Rights of way were proposed to be changed to avoid difficulties acquiring access to private lands in the region adding about 4.7 miles to the length of the lines.

The BLM also asked to add a right of way for about 844 miles of access roads throughout the project with 804 permanent miles and about 40 miles of temporary roads.

There would also be 1402 acres of added temporary work areas to support construction of the lines.

Another proposed adjustment was to shift the path of the lines around the northern call-up area of White Sands Missile Range.

This area is not a permanent section of the missile range but the federal government can “call up” the land to restrict access when it is needed for testing or other operations.

That shift would also allow SunZia to run parallel with the West Spirit Transmission Project a 345 kilovolt transmission project for wind generation projects and move the eastern substation in Torrance County closer to other wind power projects.

Going around White Sands would add about 92 miles to the project.

The western substation in Arizona was also proposed to be used to convert the power from direct current to alternating current so it can be used to power homes and business.

This would require one of SunZia’s two lines be alternating current and the other to be direct or alternating.

The direct line would require additional equipment to convert to alternating current at each of the project’s end points.

How can you participate in the decision-making process?

The BLM published its draft environmental impact statement for the SunZia project in the Federal Register which gives people the change to submit comments online through the register.

During the 90-day comment period the BLM said it would plan three public meetings for additional discussion.

LOUIS — Wild winger Jordan Greenway made his NHL debut on March 27 2018. A few weeks after that he was playing in a playoff series against the rival Winnipeg Jets. As a wide-eyed 21-year-old kid nonetheless.

“It was definitely intimidating at first” Greenway said. “You adjust quickly. The nerves kind of go away with all the adrenaline and everything like that. Obviously it’s a lot different now.”

That’s an understatement. Now a 25-year-old man Greenway is an established player in the NHL and a big reason the Wild are up 2-1 in their first-round series with the St. Louis Blues.

He scored less than a minute into Game 3 on Friday night at Enterprise Center igniting the Wild on their way to a 5-1 win. Maybe more important than the actual goal though Greenway along with linemates Joel Eriksson Ek and Marcus Foligno brought a physical presence every time he hopped over the boards.

“I think a majority of the season we usually play against the other team’s top line” Greenway said. “Not only do we want to go out there and not allow them to score 5-on-5 we want to go out and produce and get some goals.”

The confidence with which Greenway spoke about his line is emblematic of his growth. He has long boasted the size and speed to be a dominant player at the highest level. Now he has the swag to go along with it.

“It helps when the team is playing as well as we are” Greenway said. “It allows everyone to kind of play with a little more confidence and a little more edge. It’s nice to have the success we’ve been having.”

No doubt Greenway has been a key contributor in that success.

“His game has matured” coach Dean Evason said. “He has embraced what is going to allow Jordan Greenway to have success individually in the National Hockey League. That’s not dangling around people. It’s using his big body and his speed.”

Though it’s impossible to pinpoint the moment everything clicked for Greenway it’s safe to say it’s been building over the past few months. After admitting earlier this season that playing physical doesn’t come natural for him the 6-foot-6 230-pound Greenway has started to fully embrace it as of late.

Asked about Greenway’s shift in mentality Foligno joked “I just yell at him all the time to get him going. You guys don’t see it. I get him pissed off.”

Whatever works. Nowadays it’s not uncommon to see Greenway deliver a huge hit along the boards then immediately stand up for himself after the whistle.

Maybe in the past Foligno would’ve had to jump in to calm things down. Not anymore.

“He’s a guy that needed to understand that it’s the physical side first and then the skill can follow up” Foligno said. “He’s done a great job with it. The past couple games he’s been awesome. When Greener does that he’s a force out there and it’s something we need moving forward for sure.”

Aside from embracing the physical side of the game on the ice Greenway has also matured off the ice. While he always has been revered by his teammates for being a goofy guy in the locker room Greenway didn’t always channel it in the right way early in his career.

“Sometimes he took his joking around stuff into games and that’s not good” Evason said. “It’s not unlike a lot of other players. It takes time to mature. It’s taken him some time to mature and figure out his game. Now when he comes to the rink it’s businesslike and it’s allowed him to play like that.”

If the Wild go on a deep playoff run someone like Greenway could emerge as a star. Not only is he built for these types of game his confidence level is at an all time high.

“It’s too hard to come into the playoffs without having confidence” Greenway said. “I think other players see that and other teams see that and they can take advantage of that. Whether guys have it or have to fake it whatever the case is I think confidence is what allows people to have success.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vY29sb3JhZG9zdW4uY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvMDcvY29sb3JhZG8tbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC1mdW5kaW5nLWluZGl2aWR1YWwtcmVzb3VyY2VmdWxuZXNzLW9waW5pb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion: While Colorado gets its mental-health act together the village must step up.,"May is Mental Health Awareness Month and after the last two years most of us are well aware of the state of our mental health.

Vincent Atchity

Coloradans statewide are struggling with mental health more than ever. A 2021 Colorado Health Access Survey revealed that 38% of Coloradans over the age of 16 experienced a decline in mental health such as anxiety depression or loneliness as the result of COVID-19.

At the same time Mental Health America ranked Colorado dead last in the nation for access to care for adults with mental health needs. The combination of declining well-being and poor access to resources has our community facing a crisis from which we must not turn away.

Mental Health Colorado has been deeply engaged in supporting the recommendations of the behavioral health task force convened by Gov. Jared Polis in 2019. Task force recommendations have resulted in a series of bills designed to fill gaps in services all over the state most recently with the help of $450 million in federal American Rescue Plan Act funding.

This funding will enable us to build much-needed in-patient capacity — beds — for adults and youth. We will invest in recruiting and retaining our behavioral health workforce. We will take important steps toward decriminalizing mental health better coordinating care and resources and much more.

These investments won’t solve all of Colorado’s problems or solve anyone’s problems anytime soon but they will eventually make a meaningful difference in the lives of many.

In the meantime how do we become more resourceful and resilient without contributing to the long wait lists for professional support?

The scarcity of mental health care in our state leaves many of us to our own devices — as if this were an earlier era in history. In an age of heightened risk for suicide and harmful substance use we must prioritize access to care and services for those who are at greatest risk or most seriously ill.

The rest of us will have to cultivate individual peer-to-peer support for ourselves and those around us. We must remind one another to engage in practices that contribute to well-being. Be more proactive about reaching out to somebody who hasn’t been their usual self. Make inquiries. Offer companionship. Offer to help someone access resources — whether it be transportation research or caring communities.

Earlier this year Mental Health Colorado launched a campaign to surface the real-life ways people around Colorado care for themselves and find joy strength or peace. The “What’s Your Peace?” campaign is meant to get people thinking about the daily steps that bolster our mental well-being to carve out time for them with more intention and to expand our collective toolkit by sharing them with one another.

We received “peaces” from all over the state. It was no surprise to hear that hiking walking snowboarding and fly-fishing bring many Coloradans peace. We also heard from knitters bird-watchers dog-snugglers and home cooks about their self-care habits. They’re not competitive or performative — most of these moments never make it to Instagram. It’s the restorative or meditative nature of the activity itself that helps us keep our balance.

If only we could all knit hike and fish our way to holistic well-being. But for many of us the challenges run deeper.

Rough days and months are still ahead. It will take years for Colorado’s new behavioral health legislation to take hold and begin to improve access to mental health care in our community. I call on family members friends teachers hospital staff first responders and anyone who encounters someone in need to draw from — or continue to draw from — their well of kindness and humanity.

. . .

Two horses dueled down the stretch of the 148th Kentucky Derby. For most of the final moments of the race spectators at Canterbury Park cheered on as they focused on Epicenter the betting favorite at 4-1 and the Minnesota-owned Zandon.

Could Zandon run down the powerfully built Epicenter and put Minnesota in the spotlight?

But Rich Strike appeared on the inside over the final seconds and edged both to win throwing Canterbury into stunned silence.

Seriously. I ran down from the press box to roam around the betting areas following the race hoping to hear someone celebrating. There was nothing other than horseplayers mumbling ""unbelievable"" or ""I can't believe it."" There were some seriously long faces after the race.

No one was in line to cash a ticket. Rich Strike at 81-1 became the second-biggest long shot to win the Derby behind Donerail a 91-1 longshot in 1913. Zandon threatened Epicenter down the stretch for a bit but could not catch him. And both got dusted by Rich Strike. Zozos the other Minnesota-owned horse in the race started strong but finished 10th.

But officials at Canterbury reported after the race that one person affiliated with the track — meaning they either bet at the track online or through its wagering app — had Rich Strike in a superfecta that paid off $321500 for a $1 dollar bet. That's a lot of Mint Juleps. Surely those who love longshots probably had Rich Strike in some other parlays.

Hours before the race Zandon was landing in plenty of parlays. And the crowd swelled in the moments leading to post time. For the first time Canterbury held a fashion show before the race that drew more than 500 spectators. In all officials estimated that 8000 to 10000 fans turned out for Derby Day at the park.

It was a Derby that no one will forget any time soon.

Recruiting's big wrinkles

Name image and likeness (NIL) deals are now a factor in the college recruiting process. That combined with the freedom provided by the transfer portal enables athletes — legally — to follow the money when deciding to switch schools.

Commissioners for the Pac-12 and SEC met with U.S. senators on Thursday to ask for legislation to help combat these issues. The portal and NIL deals are the new way of life in college athletics. They can put college programs in tough spots when trying to attract athletes.

""It's an added challenge. It's an added piece to it"" Gophers men's basketball coach Ben Johnson said. ""What we have tried to do is work intelligently around that issue.

""If there is a kid we're recruiting and the first thing he talks about is maybe a large NIL number well then we probably move on.""

There are around 1400 players in the men's basketball transfer portal and about the same number in the women's portal. That's nearly an average of four players per program that could be looking for another school. Johnson who recently landed transfers Dawson Garcia Ta'Lon Cooper and Jaden Henley would like to add another player but it must be the right fit.

He laughed when asked how many times he checks the portal each day.

""It's an every five-minute thing"" Johnson said. ""It's a sickness.""

Lynx need strong start

The WNBA season is upon us and the Lynx intend to avoid duplicating their 0-4 start from last season.

""Last year being my first year I wasn't really sure what to expect and this year came better prepared"" forward-center Natalie Achonwa said. ""And I think we're taking more advantage of getting ready in the moment and not just going through training camp but taking advantage of every day.""

It still will be hard to avoid stumbling out of the block after a flurry of moves last week.

The Lynx had to cut guards Layshia Clarendon who's still recovering from a right fibula stress fracture and Crystal Dangerfield the 2020 rookie of the year as part of a roster crunch. They signed guard Odyssey Sims an All-Star with the Lynx in 2019. Free-agent Angel McCoughtry is recovering from injury. As the Lynx ready for their home opener Sunday they are in a spot trying to start fast when they are down some players.

They will have to ride out the opening weeks as McCoughtry gets healthy and Sims re-acclimates herself to the team. They also are waiting for Kayla McBride to return from playing in Europe. Star forward Naphessa Collier who is about to give birth to her first child wants to return before the season is over.

The Lynx could be a tough out by the end of the season. They just have to survive the start.

... AND TWO PREDICTIONS ...

Big step up to big leagues

Injuries are giving Jose Miranda a shot at the big leagues but it will be a rough baptism. Look for him to hit around .235 over the next month showing occasional power as he adjusts to tougher pitching.

Game 5 will be fun

Game 4 of the Wild-Blues series is Sunday with the series returning to St. Paul on Tuesday night. That should be a good one; the prediction here is that this series will be tied at 2-2 as it returns to Xcel Energy Center.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vY29sb3JhZG9zdW4uY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvMDgvY29sb3JhZG8tZWFnbGVzLXJhcHRvcnMtbmVzdHMtaW50ZXJ2ZW50aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,If a Colorado eagle nest falls in the forest — and the cameras are on — should anyone save it?,"Story first appeared in:

FORT COLLINS — When an aging cottonwood hosting an active eagle nest at Barr Lake State Park blew over and sank into the depths raptor fans were sad and families sent hand-drawn sympathy cards to the park office.

But state biologists stuck to their carefully considered response: “Better luck next time.”

Near Longmont a few years ago a mama eagle was electrocuted by a power line one of the hatchlings fell out of the nest and then a rattlesnake came along and punctured the fallen eaglet’s talon. Dropped at a raptor rescue for intensive care the baby bird made it and was released healed talon and all.

And when fans of a Stearns Lake nest worried the leaning tree would fall over onto Boulder County Open Space they offered to pay to prop up the branches. The county’s reaction? “That’s not what we do.”

As raptors from eagles to ospreys to great horned owls make a strong comeback in spite of relentless urban growth on the Front Range wildlife biologists acknowledge that a live-cam-loving public gets confused.

When do we intervene to save wild animals and when is nature the better judge?

Do we keep building artificial nests? Shore up ancient cottonwoods? Close more trails in nesting season? Pick up every fallen chick? Spend a week dunking eagles in warm baths to loosen cement?

And how to teach webcam watchers that a remote nest show is not meant to play like “Daddy Day Care” but “Survivor”?

“The first thing we do is try to talk people down off the ledge because they’re emotionally involved. They want to help” said Mike Tincher rehabilitation coordinator at the Rocky Mountain Raptor Program in Fort Collins. “It’s up to us to articulate and take the emotion out of it the best we can.”

Yet Tincher has found himself chasing an ailing golden eagle up and down a rain-soaked slag pile at a cement plant the bird’s wings increasingly coated in concrete and Tincher increasingly exhausted. He notes a distinction between human-caused animal disasters like a cement pile in a raptor breeding ground and natural causes like windstorms or drought. But he agrees the lines can be invisible to many.

Colorado State University veterinarian Miranda Sadar was once caught up in a Virginia debate over an eagle nest on a popular web cam when the mama died and Daddy Bird had three starving eaglets to manage. A web of wildlife agencies considered the full range of possible reactions from doing nothing to dangling fish popsicles over the nest that would drop morsels at regular intervals of melting. (They ended up taking the eaglets to a rehab center — but only after sorting the risk that the babies would see humans coming jump in a panic and injure themselves.)

Official reactions are often complicated by contact with citizens whose enthusiasm for wildlife can be undermined by inconvenient facts.

In her experience Sadar said an extremely common call to biologists and rescue centers goes like this:

We know this is a baby bald eagle.

Can you send a picture?

“They send a picture. And it’s a pigeon.”

You can build the nest but you can’t make them stay

In the 1970s after the pesticide DDT ravaged U.S. bird populations by weakening eggshells states like Colorado hoped to rebuild to 10 nesting pairs of bald eagles statewide.

Now there are more than a dozen active nests in Boulder County alone wildlife biologists say. Though counts are imprecise and in flux there are about 300 viable bald eagle nests across Colorado these days said Michelle Seubert manager of the popular bird sanctuary Barr Lake State Park.

Bird observation and conservation groups have speculated for years that burgeoning Front Range suburbs encroaching on wetlands and old cottonwood stands would renew threats to bald eagles and other raptors. But Front Range wildlife biologists say experience shows that with careful trail closures to protect wetland or cliff nesting areas many raptors seem to thrive while living close to respectful humans.

Bald eagles hang out regularly in spaces as busy as Denver’s City and Washington parks or Memorial Park in Colorado Springs. One wildlife biologist didn’t want her name attached to the observation that eagles in their frequency and eating habits may be more like seagulls than majestic national icons. But you get the idea.

Seubert and many of her regular walkers are disappointed eaglets will be missing from Barr Lake for the first time since the 1980s. But Seubert pecks through some recent history to explain why one tree falling is not catastrophic.

“Since 1986 we’ve had 61 eaglets fledge from Barr Lake” she said. The park does build artificial nesting platforms in trees safer than the dead or flirting-with-disaster cottonwoods eagles often prefer. But pairs ready to nest don’t always choose the prefabs.

A ferruginous hawk is kept in the nursery and educational area of the Rocky Mountain Raptor Program in Fort Collins. The program rehabilitates around 300 birds a year. (Photos by Olivia Sun The Colorado Sun via Report for America) Of the 300 birds rehabilitated at the facility 78% have treatable cases and can be returned to the wild.

Last year at Barr Lake a tree with a human-made nest basket fell over. Park workers put it back up in a more viable tree. The local nesting pair ignored it and built in a precarious dead cottonwood. Protective park staff and trail regulars were certain this year’s nest had eggs before an early April windstorm toppled the cottonwood into six feet of water too deep for any evidence to surface.

That’s when biologists urge birders to keep calm and binocular on.

Even on the built-up Front Range Seubert said “nature has a way of taking care of its own. And so just to know that there are plenty of nests and they’ll rebuild and come back.”

After the blowover and egg disaster one sympathy card included a sticker of Snoopy hugging Charlie Brown.

“There’s some people that commented on Facebook ‘Well they need to take all the dead trees out.’ But for the most part people are just sad” Seubert said.

Fake nests ok but no crutches for a tree

Some longtime bird observers stay at sad while others fly beyond deep into mad. And few even enlist lawyers.

Front Range Nesting Bald Eagle Studies is an amateur group that puts in serious time observing and defending local birds from perceived threats. At Boulder County’s Stearns Lake in the Carolyn Holmberg Preserve at Rock Creek Farm the group and its vocal leader Dana Bove wanted much more done to protect a locally famous nesting pair.

The pair had nested in a precarious tree in 2019 that did indeed topple with eggs on board. They moved on to another precarious tree and the watch group started agitating in 2021 for Boulder County to take more action. They wanted nearby farming activity restricted from a larger buffer zone and offered to pay the costs of propping up the latest nesting tree after any hatchlings were safely gone.

“Based on our mapping they are probably in the last viable nest tree in their three-kilometer territory” Bove said. “That nest is being supported by at least one small dead limb and will not likely last much longer.”

The group Bove added “does not promote intervention for the most part but these bald eagles have been intervened with by human disturbance.”

A red-tailed hawk kept at the Rocky Mountain Raptor Program in Fort Collins has lived at the center since 2009 and is often featured for classroom and educational outreach programs. (Olivia Sun The Colorado Sun via Report for America)

Last summer the Boulder County Attorney’s office wrote Bove back saying county biologists “do not support artificial interventions such as installing artificial nests or shoring up nests believing that eagles know best where to site their nests.”

Colorado biologists are proud of their eagle record the letter said. Existing open space agriculture does not appear to be bothering them when trail restrictions are set up properly “and this year there was an unprecedented (at least in modern times) 29 eaglets that fledged from Boulder County nests” the attorney’s office wrote.

Boulder County wildlife biologist Michelle Durant echoed others in arguing that birds not people should decide when a tree is no longer safe for a nest. “It’s always good we feel to let the birds select a different tree and in most cases we let nature run its course. What we try to do is to give the birds space.”

“No artificial nests” is not an absolute with Boulder County Open Space Durant added. There have been talks with Colorado Parks and Wildlife about building a platform at Stearns Lake if the right spot becomes clear.

“Now there’s no guarantee that the birds are going to accept it. That’s the thing. You know we’ve done this with ospreys and learned our lesson” she said.

Don’t get biologists started on the ospreys

Ospreys a more fish-centric raptor than the less finicky eagles create their own set of mixed blessings for Front Range wildlife biologists.

Left on their own the dynamic birds love to build nests in Xcel powerline towers not realizing the platforms come with the real estate as-is of potential electrocution. Xcel cooperates with open space agencies to build substitute nests — which of course the ospreys don’t always take.

A City of Boulder osprey nest cam at Valmont Reservoir is wildly popular with thousands of views said ecological stewardship senior manager Heather Swanson. (Boulder County Open Space has another osprey nest cam at the county fairgrounds in Longmont.) Live wildlife images with a compelling backstory are great ways to help the public value habitat and conservation biologists note.

But as with all social media and live footage access makes “experts” out of a distractingly high number of residents with time on their hands.

“There’s been super windy days where people are concerned that we should go put something up to help block the nest from the wind” Swanson said. “Or go put a cover over the nest because it’s going to be hailing or snowing.”

The biologists’ response Swanson said is “these are the natural conditions that these birds live in. Our job isn’t to manage that it’s just to provide them a good place to nest and then let things fall as they may.”

Will we catch you when you fall? Can we get back to you?

And fall they do.

A dazed fledgling hitting the ground before learning to soar is a cliché based on eons of reality. While on a hike or while watching the bird cams some residents see a chick on the ground and simply can’t walk away.

Take young kestrels said the rehab center’s Tincher. They are cliff dwellers and after hatching and growing they don’t use a series of high branches to fledge away from human sight as eagle chicks might.

“When they’re too big they just bail on the ground and then maybe bump around climb up on bushes and stuff like that. That’s normal” Tincher said. But those facts are unknown to kestrel newcomers who come upon what they perceive to be an awkward dangerous scene during a hike.

Great horned owls are kept in the hospital area of the Rocky Mountain Raptor Program in Fort Collins. (Photos by Olivia Sun The Colorado Sun via Report for America) A great horned owl is kept in the hospital area.

“People will say well there’s cats and coyotes! Well there’s cats and coyotes everywhere” Tincher said. “We have to look at immediate danger.”

That’s where ubiquitous cellphones and sharing technology can be an advantage for rescuers he added. Rehab centers used to waste untold time going out on calls unable to assess the situation from a voice call. Now they get pictures.

“Last night I got three calls about young great horned owls” Tincher said. “All three pictures showed three youngsters doing what they do. So we play wait and see. We have triage by picture.”

From soaring updraft to a more level flight?

The public’s — and the biologists’ — affinity for intervention does vary by species though some are reluctant to spell it out. They’re not building artificial platforms for seagulls for example.

On the interventionist side few efforts match the dedication and ingenuity of California in pulling back the condor from the brink of extinction. Breeders took away the first egg of the season and raised the hatchling with hand puppets knowing the double-clutching parent condors would then lay and hatch another that year.

Colorado biologists and amateur watchers worry that a few years of bad luck from high winds or avian flu could crack recent success with eagles. Bove’s group continues to push hard against allowing oil and gas development and new homebuilding in established raptor hunting grounds.

But if the positive trends continue biologists also say they are starting to see a time when eagle growth will level off.

“There’s going to be a limit there’s going to be a carrying capacity” Boulder County’s Durant said. “I’m just not sure when that’s going to happen.”

An early sign of that she added would be eagle nests that no longer produce two or three viable chicks. In relatively dry climates without as many fish or other wildlife eagles need broad hunting areas to accumulate the prairie dogs trout frogs and other food their babies need.

“Are they only able to successfully rear one chick because of limited resources?” Durant said.

“We’re not sure” she said. “And that’s why we do long-term monitoring. So maybe we can extrapolate some meaning from this.”

Clutter is not your friend. Besides making your space look sloppy it can also become a major distraction. Why do you think there are all of those TV shows (think: Tidying Up with Marie Kondo The Home Edit etc.) about cleaning out clutter? It can feel kind of intimidating to take on a decluttering project but your best bet is to start with something small — like all of those cables crowding your outlets and desktop.

With this 4-in-1 Multi-Port Charger you can consolidate your chaotic cable mess into one convenient cord. One one end there’s a USB-A port just like your typical Apple cable. On the other there are four different outputs — a Lightning connector USB-C Micro and Apple Watch charging pad. That means you can charge your iPhone Apple Watch tablet and another device all at the same time. It’s definitely convenient if you own an array of devices across brands. You could also charge your iPad an Android phone an Apple Watch and a Bluetooth speaker at once. And it won’t slow down the charge speed if you have four devices plugged in at once; it’s built to handle it.

Made of top-quality TPE with nylon braiding and an aluminum shell the 4-in-1 Multi-Port Charger is stronger than your average iPhone cable. And it’s just under 4 feet long so it also works well for delivering juice to devices on road trips. No more fighting over the single USB outlet. And no more having to choose which device should be charged first. Charge ‘em all.

It’s usually $34 for one of these 4-in-1 Multi-Port Chargers but for a limited time you can snag one on sale for $17.99. That’s 48% in savings and just $2 more than its price last Black Friday.
