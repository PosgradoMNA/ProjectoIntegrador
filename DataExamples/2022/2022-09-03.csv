Every year the massive plant produces nearly 12 million miles of tape — an average of 22 miles per minute — as it satisfies society's need to keep stuff stuck together.

The 1.4 million-square-foot factory celebrates 75 years in operation this year as it remains the center for 3M's globally recognized Scotch brand of tapes and a host of other products.

""Over the last 75 years 3M Hutchinson has played an important role in the company's success"" said plant manager Angie Byars.

Rolls of the translucent adhesives were spinning onto dispensers at dizzying speeds in mid-August for back-to-school shopping season which gives 3M's $6 billion consumer business an annual boost.

""This is our biggest time because we're making product for back to school and the holidays"" Byars said. ""We're getting all that inventory ready to go.""

Painter's tape was being rolled out by the ton as well. Production of the signature blue rolls had to expand to keep up with a surge in home improvement projects during the pandemic.

""There's still strong demand for painter's tape"" Byars said.

Robots conveyor belts and specialized machinery dot the landscape inside the factory which has an enclosed space equal to 25 football fields. Despite a high level of automation the plant remains Hutchinson's largest employer with 1600 workers.

""We used to have lots of people standing on lines packing tape closing boxes and putting them on the pallet — that was all manual"" said Dave Hansen the plant's manufacturing manager. ""That workforce has evolved and they're now expected to work with some high-tech equipment.""

Tape and a range of other adhesives for industrial use are the factory's focal point but the plant also makes some Post-it products and Filtrete air filters another in-demand product during the pandemic.

About 30% of the tape made in Hutchinson — over 3 million miles annually — is shipped to other locations to be cut and packaged in local languages Byars said.

Hansen has worked at the plant for 30 years. As products are developed and processes improve no two days are the same he said.

""I've seen almost all of it in one job or another but it's never gotten old"" he said. ""Every day we're working on experiments to make those products of the future.""

Rolling expansions

The sprawling campus started as a government-owned hemp rope plant used during World War II. When 3M moved in it was a 10000-square-foot building with 10 employees.

By the end of the 1970s the site encompassed 90 acres and employed 2000 people.

After spurts of major growth and additions the plant lost a big part of its identity when 3M spun off Imation in the 1990s. A wall of Scotch-brand VHS tapes in Hutchinson still pays homage to the days of producing magnetic data storage.

""It was an impressive operation"" Hansen said. ""We took some of what we learned there and incorporated it into new products.""

3M quickly filled that space with film production to meet demand in the auto building and electronics markets. Products include optical films used in cellphones and window films that block UV light.

""We are involved in inventing products today that will be in the next phone in two years"" Hansen said.

The last major expansion at the plant came in 2005 when the plant's north and south buildings were physically linked.

The Hutchinson plant has run entirely on renewable energy since August 2021 3M said and sends no waste to landfills.

At the end last year Maplewood-based 3M operated 61 factories in 29 states plus another 89 facilities in 30 countries worldwide.

""We appreciate the valuable hard work of past and current employees to manufacture products that are used in businesses and homes around the world"" Byars said.

Hotel Football the hospitality chain owned by Manchester United icons Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville has lost £3.2million over the last two years and owes more than £10m in loans.

Giggs started the business with Neville back in 2011 after retiring from football. Now annual accounts for the business - which were filed this week - show the hotel which is based near Manchester United's Old Trafford ground lost heaps of cash in 2020 and 2021 after suffering from the Covid pandemic.

The documents as first reported on by the Daily Star reveal the firm had pulled a restaurant from the National Museum of Football to save cash. Accounts show that the company behind the business – called Old Trafford Supporters Club Ltd – lost £1148879 in 2021 and £2042812 the previous year during the pandemic.

The company while unable to operate during the Covid pandemic continued to pay its workers throughout and opened up the building for the NHS to use free of charge.

Giggs' fellow director Neville said in comments attached to the figures that trading had not been 'normal' as the business had been 'hit drastically' by lockdown restrictions which had 'affected the financial figures' throughout the pandemic.

Neville also alluded to the fact that the business was still contending with issues in the wake of the pandemic with inflation costs rising rapidly. But he added: ""The directors have continued their policy of investing in the hotel to improve operational performance and to promote the Hotel Football brand even post the pandemic year.

""The directors feel that whatever the case the quality of the brand and of the property they manage cannot be sacrificed.’’

After stressing that the figures for 2022 were 'very encouraging' as life reverts back to normality Neville said the firm’s parent company Orchid Leisure Ltd had loaned the hotel business £10.2m to help it survive.

""Based on the above the directors are confident that the company will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least the next 12 months’’ he added.

Neville set up the Old Trafford Supporters Club in 2012 before Giggs joined him as a fellow director four months later. The pair progressed through the ranks at Manchester United together as part of the group known as 'The Class of 92'.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vb2JzZXJ2ZXIudWcvbGlmZXN0eWxlLzc0OTk1LXJ3ZW56b3JpLW1hcmF0aG9uLWlzLXRoZS10aGluZy10aGlzLXdlZWtlbmTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rwenzori marathon is the thing this weekend,"All is set for the inaugural Tusker Lite Rwenzori Marathon this Saturday in Kasese. The marathon at the foothills of Uganda’s tallest mountain is going to be run at a much higher altitude than the usual ones covered in Kampala.

While Kampala is at an altitude of 1200 metres above sea level the Rwenzori stands at 5109 metres offering a completely different running experience. It will involve the 42 21 and 5-kilometre races and the top five finishers will each bag Shs 5m Shs 4m Shs 3m Shs 2m and Shs 1m respectively in cash prizes.



Amos Wekesa the founder of Great Lakes Safaris (a tour operating company) that is part of the organizers of this event told The Observer of the great ecosystem that the Rwenzori is endowed with.

“Certainly for everyone that will be in Kasese will be able to experience the natural beauty of both plants and animals on and around the Rwenzori mountain. So beyond just the experience of taking part in the different races there is much to tour” Wekesa said.

The Rwenzori Marathon is where sport and tourism are going to intersect. This according to Emmy Hashakimana the marketing and innovations director at Uganda Breweries Limited. It is also an opportunity to remind people of how to live healthily by exercising their bodies. But at the same time know about the tourism sites in their country. None is probably more significant than the Rwenzori mountain with its wide range of plant and animal species.

As part of the marathon events a total of five million trees are to be planted in Kasese district where the Rwenzori mountain is situated over the next five years. That should boost the forest cover of this country quite significantly hence creating remarkable habitats for more birds and animals. The existence of many birds and animals today is threatened by the destruction of forests a situation that needs to be sorted out.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said this week that rape victims in his state can take Plan B a pregnancy-preventing emergency contraceptive known as a “morning-after pill.”

“We want to support those victims but also those victims can access health care immediately as well as to report it” Abbott said in a pre-recorded interview with KXAS-TV and The Dallas Morning News slated to air on Sunday the newspaper reported.

“By accessing health care immediately they can get the Plan B pill that can prevent a pregnancy from occurring in the first place. With regard to reporting it to law enforcement that will ensure that the rapist will be arrested and prosecuted” Abbott added according to the Morning News.

CNN has reached out to Abbott’s office for comment.

Texas’ abortion trigger-law which passed in 2021 in anticipation of the repeal of Roe v. Wade went into effect last month putting in place new criminal penalties for abortion and offering an exemption only for certain health emergencies.

The Lone Star State bars abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy which is one of the strictest in the nation and prohibits abortion before many people know they are pregnant. Under the Texas law abortion is prohibited when a fetal heartbeat is detected.

In developed countries where abortion is legal none have set a gestation limit as early as six weeks according to the Center for Reproductive Rights which campaigns for improved access to abortion.

The US Food and Drug Administration approved Plan B in 1999. The key ingredient in the pill is a synthetic hormone called levonorgestrel. This drug stops an egg from being released from the ovary or preventing fertilization of the egg by sperm.

If there has been fertilization Plan B may prevent a fertilized egg from embedding in the uterus. But if the egg has already been implanted in the uterus the morning-after pill will not work.

These upcoming CPUs will be the first major revamp in Ryzen's lineup of processors ever since its introduction in 2017.

The Ryzen 7000 CPUs are introducing an all-new architecture Zen 4 and a new socket AM5. These processors will also introduce support for DDR5 system memory PCIe Gen 5 graphics cards and storage solutions to Team Red's offerings.

At the August 29 launch event in Austin Texas AMD claimed that the upcoming processors would feature up to 13% improvements in IPC (Instructions Per Cycle). At the same event the company handed over delidded Ryzen CPU samples to media personnel who got to view the chip's internal structure.

Team Red has made fancy innovations with Zen 4 to achieve their target performance improvements. Several internal changes contribute to the 13% gain in IPC and up to 60% improvement in gaming performance over the Core i9 12900K.

Here are the five changes AMD has made with its Ryzen 7000 series.

The Ryzen 7000 lineup is the biggest innovation in AMD CPUs since 2017 and here are the 5 best things about it

1) Improved Zen 4 architecture

An overview of the Zen 4 architecture (Image via AMD)

The most important aspect contributing to the heightened performance levels of the upcoming Ryzen 7000 chips is the underlying Zen 4 architecture. For the first time AMD has shifted to a 5nm process node. This promises better performance lower latencies and better efficiency in the upcoming Ryzen-based systems.

With Zen 4 AMD has vastly increased the amount of L2 and L3 cache. Ryzen chips now pack up to 80 MB of cache memory to further contribute to the performance gain. Zen 4 processors have also been optimized to run at high clock speeds of 5 GHz and above. The flagship Ryzen 9 7950X hits up to 5.7 GHz.

Thus the Zen 4 architecture is the major factor contributing to the improvement in Ryzen 7000's performance.

2) Massively shrunk down IO chiplet lithography

The I/O die is a large silver chiplet below the two gold-plated chiplets in the substrate shown in the above picture. The overall structure and outer look of the I/O die have remained the same compared to a Ryzen 7000 chip.

However AMD has moved to a far more efficient lithography for the I/O die in the upcoming Ryzen lineup. Zen 3 processors pack an I/O die based on 12nm lithography. Zen 4 makes a massive leap by packing an I/O die manufactured on 6nm lithography.

Although the I/O die does not directly affect the core complex dies (CCDs) and their performance it significantly impacts the chip's total computing power.

3) Unique placement of Surface Mount Devices (SMDs)

Ryzen 7000 chips are easily recognizable via their eight-legged Integrated Heat Spreader (IHS). However there is a reason behind designing the IHS as a spider. The extra performance of the Ryzen 7000 chips has been brought about without increasing the size of the physical chip. This move is unlike Intel which has increased chip sizes with every generation.

AMD managed to maintain a similar chip size by moving the Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) to the side of the chip. Intel chips have their SMDs at the bottom of the chip. Thus Team Blue (Intel) had to significantly increase pin density in their latest LGA 1200 and LGA 1700 to prevent the chips from becoming too large.

Moving the SMDs above the chip has resulted in a similar IHS surface area when compared to AM4 chips. This also allows coolers made on either generation of sockets to be compatible with each other.

4) Up to three 5nm chiplets

A delidded Ryzen 7000 CPU (Image via AMD)

The upcoming Ryzen 7000 chips can house up to three chiplets depending on the SKU. The higher-end Ryzen 7 7700X the Ryzen 9 7900X and the Ryzen 9 7950X chips have two Core Complex Dies (CCDs) and one I/O die. The mid-range Ryzen 5 7600X has one CCD and one I/O die.

CCDs house individual cores and the CCXs. The I/O die mainly houses the Integrated Memory Controller (IMC) and the PCIe controller. The CCD in the upcoming Ryzen chips has been manufactured on the TSMC 5nm process node. The I/O die has been manufactured on the Global Foundries 6nm process node.

These chiplets are paramount in determining the overall IPC of the processor. The vastly improved and efficient technology used in their manufacturing contributes to the 13% improvement in performance.

5) New standard RDNA 2-based graphics processor

This iGP is expected to feature four Compute Units (CUs). They will only allow for basic video output video encoding and decoding workloads. AMD however is packing the chips with advanced video acceleration capabilities including support for decoding AV1 footage.

Conclusion

Overall the upcoming Ryzen lineup is shaping up to be an interesting series of CPUs so far. The processors will have their global debut on September 27. More data on how the upcoming chips will fare against Ryzen 5000 and the 12th Gen Alder Lake CPUs will be revealed as the embargo lifts.

On the same date X670 and X670E motherboards will launch. Users will have to wait until October for the cost-efficient budget-oriented B650 and B650E motherboards.",,,,,,,,,,,,

.Publicidad.

En la península de Guajira se concentran los mayores vientos alisios que recibe el país durante todo el año de 8 a 10 metros por segundo a 80 metros de altura y en la zona de más potencial el 10 % del territorio de Maicao hacia arriba el viento va a 1059 metros por segundo a 100 metros de altura que lo convierten en el único departamento del país con vientos de calidad mundial.

Esta favorable situación llevó al entonces presidente Iván Duque y al Ministro de minas Diego Mesa a promocionar el desarrollo de energía eólica en el norte de Colombia con unos indudables resultados: quedaron andando 16 proyectos eólicos con una capacidad de generación de 2.502 megavatios lo cual representa 24.027 megavatios hora/día así como dos líneas de transmisión del Grupo de Energía de Bogotá y de ISA.

..Publicidad..

Este es de alguna manera es el sueño del Presidente Gustavo Petro y la ministra de minas Irene Vélez del modelo de transición energética que quieren ver escalar en Colombia en el camino a ir dejando atrás las fuentes de energía destructoras del medio ambiente. ¿Cuáles son esas empresas y quienes las lideran?

EDP Renováveis - EDPR es una compañía del Grupo Energías de Portugal que ocupa la cuarta posición mundial como operador de energía eólica. Colombia es su tercer mercado en América Latina después de Brasil y México siendo EEUU el principal donde opera el 50 % de su capacidad.

En la Guajira está construyendo dos parques Alpha (Maicao) de 212 MW y Beta (Urubia) de 280 MW lo cuales les fueron adjudicados en la subasta organizada por el Gobierno en 2019 y supusieron la llegada de EDPR al país. Ambos parques cuya capacidad instalada permitiría atender la demanda de una ciudad del tamaño de Santa Marta se espera entren en operación comercial el primer semestre de 2023.

A principio de 2019 AES Colombia adquirió́ el proyecto eólico Jemeiwaa Kai de 648 MW en el municipio de Uribia hasta el momento el más grande del país y se encargó de continuar con el desarrollo construcción y operación del mismo.

AES Colombia filial de AES Gener es propiedad de la norteamericana AES Corporation fundada en 1981 empresa dedicada a la generación y distribución de energía eléctrica a nivel mundial. En Colombia hace presencia a través de la Central Hidroeléctrica de Chivor en Santa María (Boyacá) y Tunjita una pequeña central hidroeléctrica con 20 MW de capacidad instalada ubicada en Macanal (Boyacá).

En 2019 Ecopetrol le asignó la construcción de un parque solar de 21 MW en el municipio de Castilla La Nueva Meta para suministrar energía al campo Castilla el segundo más grande de Ecopetrol y en el 2020 inició la construcción de la Planta solar San Fernando de 59 MW para Cenit filial del Grupo Ecopetrol.

Isagen empresa privatizada en 2016 cuyo accionista mayoritario es la canadiense Brookfield Asset Management a través de su filial BRE Colombia Hydro Investments Ltd posee los parques Guajira I Guajira II y Wesp01.

En 2005 Wayúu S.A. E.S.P. (Wesp) realizó un convenio con Isagen para la promoción y desarrollo de un proyecto eólico localizado en el corregimiento del Cabo de la Vela municipio de Uribia de capacidad total instalada de 32 MW (parque Eólico Guajira I de 20 MW y Parque Eólico WESP 01 de 12 MW)

Guajira I fue construido por los españoles del grupo Elecnor quienes asumieron toda la ingeniería suministros terrestres y marinos y la construcción integral del parque. Fueron cerca de $ 75.000 millones los que Isagen y Elencor invirtieron para llevar a cabo la construcción.

En mayo del año pasado Isagen anunció el desarrollo del proyecto Wesp01 de 12 MW en el municipio de Uribia incluyendo el acuerdo para la cesión por parte de la sociedad Wayúu S.A. Ese mismo año en septiembre la Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales – Anla otorgó el licenciamiento ambiental para el proyecto Parque Eólico Guajira II ubicado cerca del municipio de Maicao que tendrá una capacidad total instalada entre 300 MW y 420 MW. En estudio se encuentra Guajira III de 40 MW en el municipio de Manaure.

Enerfín la filial eólica del Grupo Elecnor es la encargada de desarrollar construir y explotar proyectos de inversión en energía eólica tanto en España como en el exterior. Entre España Brasil y Canadá participa en la explotación de más de 1.200 MW. En Colombia tiene el contrato de El Ahumado por 50 MW a 20 minutos en el corregimiento de Camarones dentro del territorio denominado Línea Negra zona especial para los cuatro pueblos indígenas de la Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (Kogui Arhuaco Wiwas y Kankuamos) quienes dieron su consentimiento.

Elecnor se constituyó el 6 de junio de 1958 por un grupo de empresarios españoles entre las noblezas de Vizcaya y Andalucía marquesados y condados adornan sus apellidos. A principios de siglo eran diez familias seis vascas tres andaluzas y una vasco-andaluza las que se repartían el 60 % de Elecnor las cuales decidieron depositar el 51 % en la sociedad Cantiles XXI con la que siguen actuando concertadamente como unidad de decisión sobre Elecnor.

Está diversificada en dos grandes áreas: infraestructuras con proyectos en energía electricidad gas y telecomunicaciones; y concesional con construcción y gestión de activos de energía. Muy grande fuera de España Europa le genera el 50% de su caja.

La línea de negocios Enel Green Power de Enel Colombia es la encargada del desarrollo de los parques eólicos Windpeshi de 205 MW que junto con Tumawind y Chemesky sumarán 508 MW de capacidad instalada.

La compañía desarrolla y opera más de 1.200 de energía renovable en los cinco continentes específicamente de energía eólica produce 1691 GW a nivel global. En Colombia también se encuentra construyendo el proyecto solar La Loma de 1732 MW en el departamento del Cesar y El Paso con capacidad instalada de 862 MW energía de cuya venta se encargará Enel-Emgesa empresa controlada por el Grupo Enel.

Enel (originalmente ENEL acrónimo de Ente nazionale per l'energia elettrica) fue privatizada por el estado italiano en 1999 aunque el Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas de ese país se mantiene como el principal accionista con el 236 %.

Celsia filial del Grupo Argos cuenta con los campos de Camelia 1 de 83 MW y Camelia 2 de 84 MW en el municipio de Uribia y Acacia en el municipio de Maicao todos en construcción; más un tercero en Costa Rica en la provincia de Guanacaste con 495 MW de capacidad instalada adquirido en 2014.

Celsia de la mano de su CEO el paisa Ricardo Sierra se encuentra desconcentrando su portafolio de la energía hidráulica que representa el 95 % de su matriz energética. Además del respaldo que posee mediante generación térmica y de sus inversiones en energía eólica cuenta con más de 584 proyectos solares ubicados en Colombia Costa Rica y Honduras con capacidad instalada de 1.788 MW incluyendo el más grande en Yumbo Valle del Cauca de 99 MW.

Empresas Públicas de Medellín – EPM adelanta en la Anla los trámites para la obtención de permisos de su complejo eólico de 200 MW EO200i ubicado en la zona de Uribia.

Por lo pronto y hasta el 2023 continuará con la operación de Jepírachi el primer parque eólico del país que entró en operación comercial en abril de 2004 en inmediaciones de Bahía Portete en el municipio de Uribia con una capacidad instalada de 195 MW. La operación de Jepírachi fue suspendida a principio de 2020 acatando una resolución de la Comisión de Regulación de Energía y Gas - CREG que implicaba la adopción de nuevas tecnologías dada su antigüedad pero dada la imposibilidad de dicha actualización debido a sus características se le permitió finalizar su vida útil en 2023.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Hannah Layfield and Carl Edwards check out the design of Edwards' car for Sunday's race.

Carl Edwards loves to talk about perspective.

""Ten years ago I was living in my mother's basement"" said the 32-year-old Edwards who grew up in Missouri and now is one of the top drivers in NASCAR. ""People laughed at me when they heard what I wanted to do for a living. But now I'm living my dream.""

Saturday Edwards won the Nationwide Series race at Atlanta Motor Speedway and Sunday the fourth-ranked driver will compete in Sprint Cup's AdvoCare 500. It's been a good few weeks for Edwards as he recently re-signed with Roush-Fenway Racing to continue driving his No. 99 Aflac Ford Fusion for about $40 million.

""I have to remember that my life isn't normal. My family had so much difficulty supporting me a few years ago"" said Edwards who started dirt track racing in 1997 and moved through every level before making it to the biggest stage. ""They weren't sure this auto racing thing would work out. They just didn't have the money to do it. It was a pretty stressful time. Now it's time for me to give back.""

Edwards along with sponsor Aflac have teamed to support this year's National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. As part of the company's ""Friends of a Feather"" campaign Edwards will drive a specially painted car in Sunday's race. The design features duck feathers from front to back inscribed with names of the many unsung heroes who have gone the extra mile for 12-year-old Hannah Layfield a patient at the Aflac Cancer Center and Blood Disorders Service at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. Hannah like so many children facing cancer has an army of devoted people who have stood by her and her family during her multiple bouts with leukemia.

""I was a kid who grew up with normal problems. It's nothing like what these kids are going through"" said Edwards who visits the center often when he's in town. ""They have so much humility and strength. I mistakenly thought I would be there to inspire them. But in fact it's the opposite. They show me strength.""

Over the past 15 years Aflac has helped raise more than $65 million to help end childhood cancer. In its latest campaign on Aflac's Facebook page fans can make donations and Aflac will double the amount.

""This is an amazing program. I don't give back nearly enough. I haven't taken the time that I should and I want to change that"" Edwards said. ""When you look at what these kids are going through you realize that just trying to be a race car driver isn't as important as just trying to live. It's all about perspective.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the role of Yap1 and Taz (Wwtr1) in aging HSPCs we analyzed their expression in LK (Linneg Sca-1neg c-Kitpos) and LSK (Linneg Sca-1pos c-Kitpos) cells from young and old mice (for exemplary flow cytometry profiles see Supplementary Fig. 1). Wwtr1 mRNA as well as the Taz Protein were both strikingly induced in old LSK (oLSK) whereas Yap1 expression remained unchanged (Fig. 1a–c).

Fig. 1: TAZ (Wwtr1) is strongly induced in oLT-HSCs. a Representative flow cytometry plots of LK (Lineageneg Sca-1neg c-Kitpos) and LSK (Lineageneg Sca-1pos c-Kitpos) cells of young and old mice. b qRT-PCRs of Wwtr1 and Yap1 expression in LK and LSK isolated from young and old mice (n = 4 per age group one-way ANOVA with Tukey HSD post hoc test). c Immunoblot analysis of TAZ in LK and LSK of young and old mice. d Representative flow cytometry plots of LT-HSCs ST-HSCs and MPP in the LSK compartment of young and old mice. e Overview of the samples that were analyzed by RNA-Seq (n = 3 per group). f Principal component analysis of the RNA-Seq of the indicated populations (n = 3 per group). g Summary of gene expression changes (old vs. young) of Hippo pathway core components. h Volcano plot encompassing all transcriptional regulators (KEGG database) that were analyzed in the LT-HSC dataset old vs. young.

To analyze gene expression changes in the LSK compartment in greater detail we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) from long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs: LSK CD34neg CD135neg) short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs: LSK CD34pos CD135neg) and multipotent progenitors (MPPs: LSK CD34pos CD135pos) from young and old mice (Fig. 1d e). As expected the number of immunophenotypic LT-HSCs was strongly increased in old mice (Supplementary Fig. 2a).

ST-HSCs and MPPs showed a weaker age-dependent separation in principal component analyses whereas old LT-HSCs (oLT-HSCs) were more clearly separable from young LT-HSCs (yLT-HSCs) and showed the highest number of differentially expressed genes between old and young (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 2b). Although most Hippo core components showed only weak or no age-dependent changes Wwtr1 was strongly increased specifically in LT-HSCs and old human HSPCs (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 2c). Yap1 on the other hand was barely expressed in LT-HSCs demonstrating that Wwtr1 is the predominant transcriptional Hippo effector in these cells (Supplementary Fig. 2d).

Strikingly Wwtr1 was the most potently induced transcriptional regulator when comparing oLT-HSCs vs. yLT-HSCs (Fig. 1h).

To identify TAZ-dependent target genes in HSPCs we lentivirally overexpressed the constitutively active TAZ S89A point mutant in freshly isolated LSKs and subsequently performed RNA-Seq (Fig. 1i j). A TAZ-induced gene set consisting of 169 genes was then used to probe TAZ activity in HSCs (Fig. 1k and Supplementary Table 1). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrated that Taz-induced genes were upregulated in oLT-HSCs compared to oST-HSCs and in oLT-HSCs compared to yLT-HSCs (Fig. 1k). These results show that Taz is active in oLT-HSCs and contributes to aging-dependent gene expression changes.

Clca3a1 is induced by Taz and marks oLT-HSCs

To filter for TAZ-induced genes specific of oLT-HSCs we intersected the Taz overexpression RNA-Seq performed in LSKs with the previous RNA-Seq of young and old HSPCs (Fig. 2a). We obtained a relatively concise set of 24 genes that is also strongly induced in independent datasets (Supplementary Fig. 3a) which we refer to as aged LT-HSC-Taz signature (aLT-Taz signature). In the aLT-Taz signature Calcium-activated chloride channel regulator 1 (Clca3a1) coding an accessory protein for calcium-activated chloride channels demonstrated one of the most striking aging-dependent change in LT-HSCs (Fig. 2b). Clca3a1 expression just like the TAZ target gene Amotl2 strictly followed Wwtr1 expression in the different HSPC populations suggesting that CLCA3A1 may be used to trace TAZ activity in vivo (Fig. 2c). Remarkably Wwtr1 Amotl2 and Clca3a1 were all part of an aging HSC (aHSC) signature (Supplementary Table 1) generated by a meta-analysis of sixteen transcriptomic datasets of aged HSCs17 underlining the robustness of our results.

CLCA3A1 was barely detectable by flow cytometry in young LSK populations but specifically induced in old LT-HSCs (Fig. 2d e and Supplementary Fig. 1). CLCA3A1low HSCs purified from old animals were less quiescent than yHSCs. It took them significantly shorter to complete their first cell division in vitro18 (Fig. 2f) a typical phenotype of oHSCs19. CLCA3A1low cells demonstrated a significantly higher Ki67 positivity potentially because they showed a ~3x higher Cdk6 expression and thus were more Cdk6-dependent for cell division (Supplementary Fig. 3b–e).

RNA-Seq analysis of sorted CLCA3A1high and CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs (Fig. 2g) identified a high number of DEGs: 1169 upregulated (FDR < 0.01) and 1489 downregulated (FDR < 0.01) in CLCA3A1high vs CLCA3A1low.

Notably the aLT-Taz signature was significantly upregulated (p = 1.2e−7) in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs (Fig. 2g) showing that CLCA3A1 is a proxy for TAZ activity.

To analyze the relative contribution of the aging-dependent increase in the frequency of CLCA3A1high cells to the overall transcriptome changes during HSCs aging we compared the CLCA3A1 RNA-Seq with the old vs. young LT-HSCs RNA-Seq (Fig. 2g). Strikingly the vast majority of genes that were upregulated in CLCA3A1high cells were also upregulated in old vs. young LT-HSCs not only in our data but also in an independent RNA-Seq study7 comparing old and young LT-HSCs (Supplementary Fig. 3f). The same was true for the downregulated genes. Thus the up- and downregulated genes in CLCA3A1high cells significantly overlap with the genes up- and downregulated in oLT-HSCs (Fig. 2h). When Clca3a1 is knocked out in yHSCs in vivo20 Clca3a1 seemed to be required to maintain the HSC pool suggesting that this TAZ-induced gene also has a function in young HSCs (Supplementary Fig. 4). However we focus here on the upstream coactivator Taz because it regulates a variety of different genes that can affect the ageing phenotype.

CLCA3A1high/TAZhigh HSCs mark a specific oHSC subpopulation

To investigate the heterogeneity of Taz-dependent transcription programs in HSPCs at the single-cell level independently of any surface marker we analyzed the transcriptome of young LSK (yLSK) and oLSK by Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-Seq)21. We labeled LSKs with antibody-derived tags (ADTs) for the SLAM marker panel CD150 and CD48 as well as CLCA3A1 to validate our findings with an independent set of HSC surface markers. Based on the activity of specific gene sets (Supplementary Table 1) we were able to identify individual cells with different activities for LT-HSCs ST-HSCs and MPPs (Fig. 2i).

Graph-based clustering identified six clusters (clusters 0–5) in the single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) dataset from young and old LSK cells (Fig. 2j). With the help of the SLAM ADTs and gene set activities22 we identified cluster 1 as a cluster enriched for LT-HSC (Fig. 2j–m and Supplementary Fig. 3g h). Since functional studies would be required to demonstrate their functionality as LT-HSCs we refer to this cluster as ‘HSC-like cluster’. It contained cells expressing high Taz on mRNA level (Fig. 2k) high CLCA3A1 on protein level (Fig. 2l) and showing high activity for a CLCA3A1high gene set (Fig. 2m). CLCA3A1high were much more abundant in the aged population (Fig. 2k l) within the HSC-like cluster’. Only very few scattered yLSKs demonstrated high CLCA3A1 protein level or a high Clca3a1 gene set activity (Fig. 2l m and Supplementary Fig. 3i) suggesting that CLCA3A1high cells also exist to a minor extent in young animals. TAZ activity just like CLCA3A1 activity was largely limited to the HSC-like cluster and was strongly induced in old cells within this cluster (Fig. 2n).

The CLCA3A1high gene set activity strongly correlated with the activity of two independent LT-HSC-specific gene sets (Fig. 2o) one based on our own RNA-Seq data and one previously published23.

In summary CLCA3A1high/TAZhigh HSCs represent a specific and highly abundant population within the oHSC compartment. They are characterized by high expression of genes that qualify them as LT-HSCs but are transcriptionally distinct from yHSCs.

Old CLCA3A1low HSCs show features of “young-like” HSCs

To test whether the surface marker CLCA3A1 is sufficient to isolate a pure fraction of oHSCs and “young-like” HSCs from old mice we compared our CLCA3A1high signature with the aHSC signature. Both signatures nearly perfectly correlated at the single-cell level indicating that CLCA3A1 is an excellent marker to isolate oHSCs (Fig. 3a b). Remarkably a substantial number of old cells with low CLCA3A1high gene set activity were present in the HSC-like cluster (Fig. 3c) suggesting that a CLCA3A1low immunophenotype marks individual “young-like” HSCs within the pool of oHSCs.

In accordance with the aged phenotype of CLCA3A1high HSCs CLCA3A1 induction also correlated with a gene expression profile of myeloid-biased LT-HSCs (MyLT-HSCs)24 at the single-cell level (Supplementary Fig. 5a) and in the bulk RNA-Seq dataset (Fig. 3d). Consistently Clca3a1 expression clearly correlated with the expression of CD150 a marker of MyLT-HSC in flow cytometry analyses (Fig. 3e).

Given the fundamental differences between CLCA3A1low and CLCA3A1high HSCs at multiple levels we next tested whether these two cell populations also differ functionally. To this end we analyzed their long-term repopulating capacity and their long-term multilineage reconstitution potential in competitive repopulation assays. Two expected hallmarks of oLT-HSCs in this assay are functional decline in long-term repopulation and myeloid skewing of peripheral blood (PB) cells. We transplanted CD45.2-expressing CLCA3A1high or CLCA3A1ow LT-HSCs together with CD45.1/2 competitor cells into lethally irradiated CD45.1 (Ly5.1) recipient mice. PB chimerism was investigated monthly over a period of 4 months. One month post-transplantation chimerism in the blood of CLCA3A1high recipients was comparable to those who received CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs (Fig. 3f). Over time however recipients of CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs showed a gradual decline of donor contribution to the PB (Fig. 3f g) demonstrating a defect in long-term repopulating activity of the CLCA3A1high population. The frequency of CLCA3A1low-derived leukocytes in contrast remained stable compared to the young and age-matched competitor cells (Fig. 3f). In addition CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs produced significantly more myeloid cells in the PB and fewer B and T cells (Fig. 3g). Four months after transplantation spleen and bone marrow (BM) chimerism appeared strongly decreased in recipients receiving CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs (Supplementary Fig. 5b c). Within the donor-derived compartment Clca3a1high- and CLCA3A1low-derived cells generated a similar frequency of myeloid progenitors but the CLCA3A1low samples showed a higher frequency of common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs)—a typical characteristic of yHSCs3 (Supplementary Fig. 5d). Irrespective of the donor status (CLCA3A1high or CLCA3A1low) CLCA3A1 expression was lost in the BM 4 months after transplantation and the two different cell populations showed similar behavior in secondary transplantations.

Old HSCs induce Taz to keep a minimal regenerative potential

Next we tested whether Taz actively contributes to the functional decline of CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs or whether it gets induced to counteract defects in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs. Intriguingly Clusterin (gene name Clu) was potently induced in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Previous studies showed that Clu expression is YAP1-dependent and is induced in stressed cells to trigger a regenerative response25. To test whether TAZ has a similar function in oHSCs we depleted TAZ in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs using two potent shRNAs (shTAZ#1 and shTAZ#2) shTAZ#2 being more potent than shTAZ#1 and a control shRNA (shRen) targeting Renilla (Fig. 4a). We isolated CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs infected them ex vivo with lentiviral shRNA constructs and transplanted these cells into lethally irradiated recipients. Transplanted CLCA3A1high populations contained ~60–80% infected (GFP-positive) and ~20–40% uninfected (GFP-negative) cells in order to use the GFP-negative fraction as a competitor against the GFP-positive fraction from the same donor and follow the frequency of GFP-positive cells within the CD45.2 donor fraction over time (Supplementary Fig. 6b). In the PB shTAZ-transduced donor cells rapidly lost the GFP signal demonstrating that uninfected cells outcompeted TAZ-depleted cells whereas shRen cells maintained a stable frequency of GFP-positive cells (Fig. 4b).

The experiment was independently repeated three times. b PB analysis after transplantation of CLCA3A1high HSCs transduced with the indicated shRNAs.

TAZ-depleted HSCs showed a tendency to produce increased numbers of myeloid cells and decreased numbers of B and T cells (Supplementary Fig. 6c). The effects appeared subtler when compared to those observed for competitive repopulation although both Taz shRNAs showed similar trends. The inferior fitness of shTAZ progeny was also reflected in the BM where TAZ depletion led to a significantly reduced GFPpos fraction in lineage-negative (Linneg) precursor cells (Fig. 4c). The percentage of CD34neg LSK cells in the GFP-positive compartment however remained largely unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 6d) indicating that HSCs were not lost due to Taz depletion. The RNA-Seq analysis of donor-derived LSK CD34neg cells 4 months after transplantation revealed that TAZ-depleted cells were transcriptionally distinct from shRen cells (Fig. 4d e) and that TAZ depletion led to a downregulation of the top 200 genes that were induced in old LT-HSCs (Fig. 4f). These transcriptional profiling analyses in conjunction with our transplantation studies of TAZ-depleted HSCs demonstrate that TAZ sustains a transcriptional program that protects aged HSCs from functional decline.

Clca3a1low HSCs resemble yHSCs at the chromatin level

Given the fundamental changes that occur at the epigenomic level in oHSCs7 we analyzed the chromatin changes in CLCA3A1high and CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs. To this end we profiled the global chromatin accessibility of these cells as well as yHSCs and oHSCs by FAST-ATAC-Seq (Fig. 5a b)26.

We identified 43031 peaks that were shared between all four samples (Fig. 5b). Strikingly CLCA3A1high HSCs and oHSCs demonstrated many additional peaks of these 22023 were shared between these two samples. The functional GO term analysis of those additional peaks demonstrated a clear enrichment for pathways involved in direct or indirect regulation of TAZ e.g. Hippo and Wnt signaling pathways (Fig. 5c)27. Also the Wwtr1 locus itself showed changes in chromatin accessibility specifically in candidate enhancer regions which are hypomethylated in oHSCs7 (Supplementary Fig. 7). Differential peak analysis of CLCA3A1high vs. CLCA3A1low HSCs corroborated the trend toward more peaks in CLCA3A1high HSCs (Fig. 5d–f). Increased accessibility also led to greater expression of the associated genes at the mRNA level (Fig. 5e f) which shows that chromatin changes can impact on gene expression.

To identify changes in TF accessibility indicative of altered TF activity which could explain the functional differences we performed a chromVAR analysis28. In accordance with our transcriptomic profiling of CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs and yLT-HSCs CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs clustered together with yLT-HSCs whereas CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs clustered with oLT-HSCs (Fig. 5g h). Furthermore the accessibility of the TEAD motifs was much higher in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs than in yLT-HSCs indicating that TEAD/TAZ is more active in these cells (Fig. 5i).

Collectively our data demonstrate that old CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs have lower TEAD/TAZ activity than CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs and resemble yLT-HSCs at the transcriptional chromatin and functional level.

Low PU.1 expression is associated with aging phenotypes

To understand chromatin accessibility changes in aging HSCs at the single-cell level we performed single-cell ATAC-Seq (scATAC-Seq) of young and old LT HSCs and of CLCA3A1high and CLCA3A1low LT HSCs (Fig. 6a d). Analysis of differentially accessible TF motifs showed a striking correlation when comparing changes in old vs. young and CLCA3A1high vs. CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs (Fig. 6g). Here DNA sequences bound by ETS transcription factors (SPI1 and SPIC) were identified as the most differentially accessible sites in both comparisons as well in our bulk ATAC-Seq data (Fig. 6g and Supplementary Fig. 8a b). While the accessibility of Spi1 motifs progressively decreased from young to old and from CLCA3A1low to CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs the accessibility of a Tead motif showed an opposite behavior when we analyzed the behavior of these motifs in pseudotime analyses (Fig. 6h i). oLT-HSCs are thus a heterogeneous pool of cells where opposed activities of PU.1 and TEAD/TAZ define functionally distinct populations which can be separated based on CLCA3A1. Remarkably Spi1 encodes the transcription factor PU.1 a key regulator of HSC function29 suggesting that the activity of this critical regulator is decreased during HSC aging. Consistently Spi1 expression demonstrated a sharp drop specifically in the HSC-like cluster 1 but not the adjacent cluster 0 in our scRNA-Seq data (Fig. 6j). To investigate whether decreased Spi1 expression in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs also affects PU.1 target gene expression we generated PU.1-dependent gene sets from hematopoietic progenitor cells. For that we depleted PU.1 in the HSC-like cell line BM-HPC#530 using two potent shRNAs and performed RNA-Seq (Fig. 6k l). We identified 667 genes which were downregulated (log2FC < (−1) padj<0.05: shPU1.down) and 899 genes that were upregulated (log2FC > 1 padj < 0.05: shPU1.up) upon PU.1 depletion (Fig. 6l). Consistent with low PU.1 expression in CLCA3A1high HSCs HSC-like cluster 1 contained significantly more cells with high shPU1.up AUC from old vs young a trend which could not be observed in the adjacent cluster 0 (Fig. 6m). Furthermore the shPU1.up gene set was significantly upregulated when comparing CLCA3A1high vs. CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs while the shPU1.down gene set showed opposite regulation (Fig. 6n). We noticed that many genes encoding surface markers commonly used to isolate HSCs (Cd34 Flt3 (CD135) Cd48 Procr (EPCR)) were affected by PU.1 depletion in BM-HPC#5 and were also downregulated in CLCA3A1high vs. CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs (Fig. 6l o). Low Spi1 expression in oHSCs could hence explain the increased frequency of immunophenotypic HSCs commonly observed in aged individuals. We confirmed this by flow cytometry comparing young and old LSK since the frequency of immunophenotypic LT-HSCs in old Clca3a1low LSK resembled that of yLSK cells (Fig. 6p q).

These data demonstrate that HSC aging is associated with a gradual depletion of PU.1 which correlates with specific features of oHSCs at the transcriptional and immunophenotypic level.

Decreased Spi1 expression in yHSC drives features of aging

To test whether decreased PU.1 levels in yHSCs is sufficient to induce an “old-like” HSC phenotype we depleted PU.1 in yHSCs from 14- to 17-week-old by two independent shRNAs. We analyzed the PB and BM only 2 months after transplantation as PU.1-deficient HSCs are lost shortly after transplantation31. PU.1-depleted HSCs rapidly lost their ability to contribute to the production of PB cells but had mostly weaker effects on other parameters in BM and PB (Supplementary Fig. 9a–d). Due to the critical role of PU.1 in progenitors downstream of the HSC compartment we consequently focused on PU.1’s role in HSCs. Therefore we performed scRNA-Seq of the LSK compartment from control- (shRen) and PU.1-depleted (shPU1 #1 and shPU1 #2) HSPCs 2 months after transplantation (Fig. 7a–d Supplementary Fig. 9e). Graph-based clustering revealed seven clusters (Fig. 7a). We used a previously defined stringent HSC vs. MPP1 gene set23 (LT-HSC #2 Fig. 2i) to identify “HSC-like cells” in our scRNA-Seq data. In this way we identified two populations consisting mainly of HSC-like cells (Fig. 7b). One population located in clusters 2 and 5 contained almost exclusively PU.1-depleted HSC-like cells while shRen HSC-like cells were mainly found in cluster 0 (Fig. 7c d). Just as in BM-HPC#5 cells PU.1 depletion in young HSC-like cells resulted in drastic gene expression changes with Cd34 as well as Flt3 being potently downregulated (Fig. 7e). Consistent with the previously described role of PU.1 in maintaining HSC quiescence genes induced after PU.1 depletion in HSC-like cells showed highly significant enrichment for E2F-dependent target genes (Supplementary Fig. 9f g). Noteworthy Taz mRNA was undetectable in the scRNA-Seq dataset suggesting that PU.1 depletion alone does not lead to Taz induction. The shPU1.up gene set showed high activity exclusively in clusters 2 and 5 which contained shPU1 HSC-like cells (Fig. 7f). Strikingly PU.1 depletion alone was sufficient to induce an “aged-like” transcriptome in young HSC-like cells without inducing a myeloid-biased LT-HSC gene expression program (Fig. 7g h) suggesting that decreased PU.1 expression in oHSCs does not contribute to this phenotype or that it takes longer to establish. However the aHSC gene set showed high activity specifically in PU.1-depleted HSC-like cells with low PU.1 activity—equivalent to high sh.PU1.up activity (Fig. 7i).

Given the partially overlapping phenotype that depletion of TAZ and PU.1 had on the regenerative potential of HSCs and their opposite activities in our scATAC analyses we hypothesized that Taz is induced during aging to compensate for the decreased PU.1 expression in oHSCs—possibly because TAZ can act as a coactivator for PU.1. Consistent with this hypothesis PU.1 and TAZ depletion showed a convergent transcriptional response upon depletion (Fig. 7j). Moreover PU.1 and TAZ physically interacted in GST pulldown assays and TAZ was able to act as a potent PU.1 coactivator in transient luciferase reporter assays in a strictly PU.1-dependent manner (Fig. 7k l). Since we were not able to obtain high-quality genomic binding data for PU.1 or TAZ from freshly sorted HSCs we performed Cut&Run for PU.1 in BM-HPC#5 cells to identify genes that are directly regulated by PU.1. The 3163 PU.1 Cut&Run peaks were highly enriched for ETS-motifs and were almost exclusively located in promoter regions (Fig. 7m–p). To identify direct PU.1 target genes that are induced in a TAZ-dependent manner we intersected the PU.1 peaks with the genes that are significantly downregulated in transplanted old CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs (Fig. 4e) upon TAZ depletion (Fig. 7q). We identified here 60 genes that were potently downregulated (with a median log2 fold change of −4.8) upon TAZ depletion (Supplementary Table 1). Here the two gene ontology terms centrosome and microtubule organization which play a critical role in mitosis and symmetric vs. asymmetric cell division were highly enriched in these 60 genes (Fig. 7r). Thus our data show that age-dependent loss of PU.1 activity in HSCs is sufficient to induce aging phenotypes and that Taz can counteract them at least in part by acting as a PU.1 coactivator for specific genes (Fig. 7s t).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNDY3LTAyMi0zMjkyMS130gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Expanding the terpene biosynthetic code with non-canonical 16 carbon atom building blocks,"Chemicals and enzymes

Gene cloning and expression in yeast

All primers used for cloning purposes are listed in the Supplementary Table 2. Yeast codon optimized versions of S. plymuthica sodorifen methyltransferase (SpSodMT) (GenBank WP_004943917.1) A. grandis γ-humulene synthase (AbHumS; GenBank U92267) K. griseola terpentetriene synthase (Cyc2; GenBank AB048795.1) and H. aurantiacus kolavelool synthase (HaKS GenBank ABX04786) were obtained by gene synthesis bearing flanking regions containing specific restriction sites and a generic sequence compatible for USER cloning. Using the generic primes USER-Gen-FP and USER-Gen-RP the above genes were amplified and cloned by USER cloning into a generic backbone introducing BamHI and EcoRI sites at the 5’ end and NotI BglII and XhoI sites at the 3’ end. The constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Subsequently the genes of interest were excised from the generic USER vector by BamHI and XhoI digestion and ligated into pESC vector (Agilent Technologies Cat. #217453) of different selection (TRP for SpSodMT HIS for TPSs) linearized with BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes. This approach enabled subcloning of the genes of interest under P GAL1 promoter and resulted into construction of the following plasmids: pESC-TRP/SpSodMT pESC-HIS/AbHumS pESC-HIS/CYC2 and pESC-HIS/HaKS. Genes encoding the different other TPSs involved in this study (full list available in Supplementary Table 5) were available from previous work as compatible parts for subcloning in pESC-HIS linearized with BamHI and XhoI21313233.

pESC-Leu/CPR2 vector carrying the cDNA encoding a cytochrome P450 reductase from poplar (CPR2)39 was previously modified46 to enable standardized CYPs cloning under the P GAL10 promoter into the EcoRI and NotI restriction sites.

The rest of CYPs (full list available in Supplementary Table 5) were available from previous work144647. All CYPs involved in this study were digested with EcoRI and NotI and subcloned in pESC-Leu/CPR2 linearized with the same restriction enzymes to obtain bifunctional constructs for simultaneous expression of one CYP and CPR2.

Selected S. cerevisiae strains were cultivated in 10 mL CM liquid media. Liquid-liquid extraction of 1 mL culture using hexane was applied for measuring the C 16 compounds produced in yeast cells after 48 h of culturing followed by GC-MS and GC-qTOF analysis (see details in the corresponding section below). For quantification 0.01% isopropyl myristate was used as internal standard. Samples were analyzed in triplicates and the error calculated as the mean absolute deviation (MAD) around the mean. Purified C 16 compounds obtained from yeast were used as standards when available to quantify the titer of specific compounds. Titers of compounds 1d and 2d were calculated using the corresponding standards while the average signal peak area of 1d and 2d standards was calculated and used for quantification of the titers of compounds 3d and 4d. Titers of compounds 1b-5b and 7b-10b were calculated using their corresponding standards. Titer of compounds 13OH-1b and 9OH-3b produced by PtAO were calculated based on the purified 13OH-1b and 9OH-3b standards respectively. The average signal of 13OH-1b and 9OH-3b was used for quantification of compounds 11-15. Titers of total C 16 products were calculated using the average of standards corresponding to the most representative products in the profile of each individual mutants.

Shake flask large scale cultivation

For the extraction of C 16 olefins 1% (w/v) Diaion HP20 (Supelco Bellefonte PA) was used as adsorbent resin. The HP20 beads were activated by ethanol and washed by Milli-Q water before use. A two liter culture of yeast cells in Gal/Raff-CM medium together with 2 g HP20 beads were incubated in shake-flasks at 30 °C for 3 days. The medium and beads were subsequently extracted with hexane (3 × 1 L) at room temperature. The resulting hexane phase was evaporated to dryness by rotary evaporator.

Fed-batch fermentation

Seed cultures were prepared by inoculating 5 mL of overnight cell culture into 500 mL selective CM glucose media and cultivated at 30 °C and 150 rpm. After 6 h of growth the seed cultures were washed 3 times with water and added to a 5 L bioreactor (Sartorius benchtop bioreactor with BIOSTAT B Plus controller) containing two liter of CM galactose/raffinose media. Fermentation was carried out at 30 °C with the pH maintained at 4.2 by automatic addition of 4 M NaOH. Airflow was maintained at 1 L/min for the first 24 h increased to 2 L/min from 24 h to 48 h and finally set to 10 L/min after 48 h for the remainder of the fermentation. The dissolved oxygen concentration was controlled at above 20% saturation by agitation cascade between 100-500 rpm. 200 mL of 15× concentrated media (30% galactose 15% raffinose 10% YNB 2% dropout mix) was manually fed into the culture at 48 h with subsequent daily feedings of 400 mL 15× media. Fermentations were terminated after 7–9 days and the cultures extracted.

The His-tagged proteins were then purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography and eluted with 60 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) 0.5 M NaCl 250 mM imidazole and 8% glycerol. The enzymatic activity of SpSodMT was assayed in 0.2 mL reaction containing 10 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0) 20 mM MgCl 2  0.2 mM MnCl 2  10 mM DTT and using as co-substrates 120 µM SAM and 70 µM of GPP FPP or GGPP. The reactions were incubated for 18 h at 30 °C and terminated by addition of 0.2 mL 2 N HCl in 83% ethanol and 0.2 mL hexane.

The obtained cultures were diluted to OD 600 ~0.1 (time 0) in a final volume of 25 mL and were incubated at 30 °C with 150 rpm shaking. Measurements of OD 600 were taken every 2 h to monitor the curve of yeast growth (Supplementary Fig. 3). For OD 600 values higher than 1 samples were diluted accordingly.

Analysis of yeast sterols and squalene

A volume of 4 mL yeast cultures induced to express SpSodMT (or containing the empty pESC-TRP vector) was used to collect yeast cells. The obtained pellet was treated with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) in a ratio of 2:1 (v/w) resuspended in 500 µL 10% KOH in 80% EtOH solution and incubated at 70 °C for 2 h. Samples were cooled at room temperature and overlaid with 300 µL of hexane followed by vigorous vortexing prior to collecting the hexane phase. The extraction was repeated three times and the collected hexane phase (~0.9 mL) was initially washed with water (equal volume) three times and then evaporated down to 100 µL and derivatized with 50 µL trimethylsilyl cyanide (Sigma Cat. #212849) for 30 min at 60 °C prior to GC-MS analysis46.

He carrier gas was helium with a linear velocity of 30 cm/sec and the following temperature program was used: initial temperature 60 °C ramp to 170 °C at 10 °C/min ramp to 210 at 2 °C/min ramp to 300 °C at 20 °C/min hold for 5 min. This method was used for analysis of samples resulting from hexane extractions of S. cerevisiae grown in buffered media expressing SpSodMT together with Cyc2 or HaKS and SPME fiber sampling of the head-space of in vitro enzymatic reactions using S. cerevisiae expressed SpSodMT together with Cyc2 or HaKS.

GC-APCI-QqToF experiments were performed on a Scion 456 GC system (Bruker Daltonics) with a micrOTOF-Q II (QqToF) mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) using an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source (APCI). Samples (1 µL) were injected at 250 °C in splitless mode using a BR-5ms capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm ID x 0.25 µm film thickness; Bruker Daltonics). The carrier gas was helium with a constant flow of 1.0 mL min−1. The temperature program was: 50 °C for 1 min ramp to 280 °C at 15 °C min−1 and hold for 3.67 min. The transfer line was maintained at 280 °C and the temperature of the APCI source was 280 °C and of the APCI heater 200 °C. The charging voltage was 2000 V. The mass spectrometer was operated in full scan positive ion mode with the following settings: m/z 80 − 310: nebulizer gas (nitrogen) 3.5 bar; drying gas (nitrogen) 2.5 L min−1; drying gas temperature 240 °C; capillary voltage 3000 V; spectra acquisition rate 5 Hz.

Data analysis was performed using Compass DataAnalysis software (Version 4.3 Bruker Daltonics).

GC-MS-olfactometry

Samples containing 100–300 μg of each of the isolated compounds were directly injected on Tenax-TA traps (200 mg of Tenax-TA mesh size 60/80 Markes International Llantrisant UK). The trapped volatiles were thermally desorbed (TurboMatrix 300 Perkin Elmer Shelton USA) using a two-step procedure: Primary desorption was at 250 °C with a 50 mL min−1 flow of carrier gas for 15.0 min. The stripped volatiles were trapped in a Tenax-TA cold trap (30 mg held at 5 °C) which was subsequently heated at 300 °C for 4 min (secondary desorption outlet split 1:10). This allowed for rapid transfer of volatiles to a GC-MS (6890 N GC interfaced with a 5973 MSD from Agilent Technologies Palo Alto California) through a heated (225 °C) transfer line. Separation of volatiles was carried out on a ZB-Wax capillary column 30 m long x 0.25 mm internal diameter 0.50 µm film thickness. The column pressure was held constant at 2.3 psi resulting in an initial flow rate of 1.4 mL min−1 using hydrogen as carrier gas. The column temperature program was: 10 min at 30 °C from 30 °C to 240 °C at 8 °C min−1 and finally 5 min at 240 °C. The effluent of the column was split in a ratio of 1:2:2 between the mass spectrometer (electron ionisation mode at 70 eV scanning m/z ratios between 15 and 300) and two olfactory detector ports (ODP-2 Gerstel Mülheim an der Ruhr). Agilent Chemstation (E.02.02.1431) was used for data acquisition and data analysis.

Construction of the SpSodMT structural model

The structural model of SpSodMT was constructed using the SWISS-MODEL server51 and 5kok29 as template scoring a GMQE of 0.52 and a QMEAN of −2.70 and covering amino acids 31-325. S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) was imported into the model from 5kok and FPP was chosen as a ligand from the ZINC database (ID: ZINC12494625). Using the SwissDock program FPP was not found to dock next to SAH in the expected pocket. VegaZZ AMMP edition was used to optimize SpSodMT model by selecting the Conjugate Gradient (CG) algorithm for energy optimization and the CHARMM force field for fast docking. A total of 645 steps were run. The docking results using the optimized SpSodMT model demonstrated that FPP was placed next to SAH as expected. To obtain a more accurate model the optimization process was repeated following conversion of SAH into S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). The final model displayed a deeper cavity for FPP than the initial model and 4 Å distance from SAM to FPP as expected for a methyl transfer5253. Subsequently a refined SpSodMT model was obtained using Molecular mechanics (MM2) algorithm54. The energy optimization was performed with the software Chem3D (v. 16.0) from CSC Cambridge (USA). Residues F56 Q57 F58 G187 I189 S190 N219 V273 W276 L302 and W306 were identified within 5 Å of the isoprene unit tail and were selected as potential mutagenesis targets for modifying product specificity.

Water depths in the HMB range from 20 m in the north to 110 m in the south. This study used marine sediment from the deep-drilled cores HMB-103 (34°43.50'N 125°37.51'E; water depth of 48 m) and HMB-102 (34°7.96’N 125°40.94’E water depth: 57 m). The HMB is characterised by high sedimentation rates (approximately 0.2 cm/yr) allowing for the reconstruction of the SST record at a high resolution. To investigate changes of monthly mean SST at the study area in situ SST data from Chilbaldo buoy station (dataset from the Korea Meteorological Administration KMA) for the period 1998–2018 was examined (Fig. 1b)24. The lowest SST (5.4 °C) occurs in February whereas the highest (22.4 °C) occurs in August. The annual mean SST is 13.7 °C.

SST at the study area is strongly influenced by the seasonality of two atmospheric circulation systems: the mid-latitude Westerly Jet (WJ) and the East Asian monsoon. During winter the main route of the WJ lies in the south of the Himalayas (< 30°N)2526 and the dry and cold terrestrial air mass anchored in Siberia expands southward27. Conversely during summer the WJ moves to the north of the Tibetan Plateau (> 42°N). The wet and warm subtropical air mass from the Northwest Pacific overarches the East Asian marginal sea areas. Change in atmospheric heat flux associated with seasonality of the two-circulation system is the primary cause of SST variations in this shallow area28. The extended winter regime with both dry and cold air and stronger wind speed accompanied by the southward shift of the WJ can maintain the vertical contrast between the local ocean and the atmosphere and cause excessive heat loss to the atmosphere thereby decreased the SST272930. In the meantime the persisting summer regime associated with the northward migration of Westerly Jet would reduce the heat loss to the atmosphere thereby increases the SST.

Radiocarbon dating of ten samples from cores HMB-102 (six samples) and -103 (four samples) has been previously measured using benthic foraminifera and bivalve shell in Holocene muddy sediments31. The age-depth model for each core was constructed using the Bacon 2.5 package in R32 with the Marine20 radiocarbon calibration curve and the ΔR value of 284 ± 39 years (Fig. 2). The Bacon method simulates the accumulation rates of core sediments based on Bayesian statistics and calculates the ages and uncertainties (1σ) of sediment deposits. Core HMB-103 covers the last 6.5 cal kyr B.P.; while core HMB-102 covers the period between 6.9 and 10 cal kyr B.P.. The results of the 210Pb dating of the HMB-103 and other core-top sediments collected near the HMB-103 were examined. The 210Pb and 226Ra activities were measured at the Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI). The observed excess 210Pb activities in the box cores indicate that the core-top surface sediments near the HMB-103 are modern-day sediments which is in line with previous findings33. However the 210Pb dating of HMB-103 indicates that the upper most sediment appears to be at least 111 years older than the sampling year of 2013 (see “Method”). According to the age model the core HMB-103 and -102 have a high sedimentation rate (approximately 0.2 cm/yr) which allows for the SST reconstruction at a high resolution (approximately 10–20 years) for the Holocene.

A new high-resolution alkenone SST composite covering the Holocene was constructed by combining records from cores HMB-103 and -102. For the SST reconstruction of HMB-103 newly analysed alkenone data (269 samples) were added to the previously published temperature data (80 samples)24 hence a total of 349 samples were used in this study. For the HMB-102 188 new samples were added to the previous 41 samples24. Since we collected sediment samples at 3 cm interval there could be bioturbation effects. In this case the temperature signal would be smoothed and/or reduced by mixing of the sediments. The error range of the alkenone temperature assessment for replicate samples of the two kinds of homogeneous laboratory-standard marine sediments exhibited less than ± 0.05 °C (n = 90) and ± 0.07 °C (n = 7) at 95% confidence level respectively. The alkenone SST estimates obtained from the 31 core-top sediments collected near HMB-103 were compared with in situ temperatures24. The results indicated that the alkenone unsaturation index effectively represented the averaged SST from April to October in this area (Fig. 1b).

Figure 3ab shows the resulting high-resolution SST record reconstructed from alkenone analysis of the HMB-102 and -103 cores. The 10-year interpolated alkenone SSTs are listed in Supplementary Table S1. The essential observed characteristic was the periodic SST fluctuations on a multidecadal- to millennial-scale. Although the amplitude of variations often range within ± 1 °C (Fig. 3a) these periodic fluctuations were distinct considering the error range of SST reconstructions from homogeneous marine sediment (< ± 0.1 °C). SSTs were relatively warm during the early Holocene (8–10 cal kyr B.P.) then cooled during the period of 6.5–8 cal kyr B.P. then warm again between 5 and 6.5 cal kyr B.P. (Fig. 3a). There were several distinct and rapid cooling events with a large amplitude up to 3 °C during the period of 7–9 cal kyr B.P. (Fig. 3a). In a previous study on the reconstruction of low-resolution (~ 50 years) alkenone SSTs from cores HMB-102 and -103 Bae et al.24 demonstrated that the cold period dropped by 2 °C for the period of 3–5 cal kyr B.P. was a regional pattern in the mid-latitudes of East Asia via comparison with other regional temperature records. Two cooling periods (3–5 cal kyr B.P. and ~ 7–8 cal kyr B.P.) were possibly associated with millennial variations. To remove the cooling patterns on a millennial scale and investigate centennial variations we extracted 50–2000 years periodicities from the raw dataset by applying a band-pass filter (Fig. 3b). The spectral analysis of band-pass filtered SSTs revealed significant (> 90% confidence level) periodicities of 544 414 190 135 102 and 89 years (Fig. 4a). In addition 1034-year cycle variability seems to exist (Fig. 4a). We also conducted wavelet analysis on the Holocene alkenone SSTs (Fig. 5a). The cycles of 544 414 190 135 102 89 and 78 years were significant for the interval of 7–9 cal kyr B.P. (Fig. 5a). Another characteristic of the wavelet analysis results is that 1034-year cycles predominated during the early to mid- Holocene (Fig. 5a). The periodic centennial-scale fluctuations of alkenone SSTs with the periodicities of 190 135 102 and 89 years have been strengthened after 2 cal kyr B.P. (Fig. 5a). Overall the composite SST record indicated the occurrence of centennial-scale variability over the last 10000 years.

We used the Holocene total solar irradiance (TSI) data obtained by Steinhilber et al.19 (Fig. 3c) for comparison with our composite SST record. TSI data have been reconstructed based on the principal component analysis of production rates of 14C in tree ring and 10Be obtained from ice cores collected in Greenland and Antarctica. Variations in TSI during the Holocene exhibit periodic fluctuations on multidecadal to millennial scales although the magnitudes were less than 1 W/m2 (Fig. 3c). The spectral analysis on band-pass filtered (50–2000 years) TSI data revealed that the periodicities of 353 206 150 130 104 and 87 years were significant (> 90% confidence level) (Fig. 4a). The wavelet analysis of the TSI data demonstrated that the periodic centennial-scale fluctuations of solar activity have been strengthened for the periods of 0–3 4.5–6 and 7–9 cal kyr B.P. (Fig. 5b).

The composite SST record was compared to the variations in solar activity over the Holocene (Fig. 3) showing a good agreement at the centennial scale. Periods of low SST corresponded approximately to those of low TSI within the estimated age error (± 60–90 years). In particular the periods of minimum solar activity known as Dalton (~ 1820 CE) Maunder (~ 1680 CE) and Spörer (~ 1470 CE) which have been previously recognised from sunspot observation data covering the last 500 years correspond to cold intervals in our SST composite. We compared the cross spectrum analysis results obtained from these two datasets (Fig. 4b). Cycles of 89 and 102 years in the SST record could have been associated with those of 87 and 104 years in the TSI record (i.e. Gleissberg cycles). Additionally the 190-year cycles observed in HMB-103 were similar to the 206-year TSI cycles (i.e. Suess/de Vries cycles). Finally the 414-year cycle may reflect 353-year TSI cycles (unnamed cycles). The results of the coherence calculation between the SSTs and the TSI confirm the correspondence of the periodicities between them (Fig. 4b). The periodicities of 88 102 130 247 and 927 years are highly coherent between SST and TSI (> 99% Monte Carlo false alarm level) (Fig. 4b). The simultaneous occurrence of cold SSTs and low TSI combined with their similar cyclicity indicates that the solar activity may have influenced the centennial-scale SST variability in the study area.",,,,,,

Do Not Let Your Children Play With Old Plastic Toys

Playing with old plastic toys may not be good for your child's health. Toxins found in old toys and dress-up items made of plastic.

Reuse and recycling of old products helps prevent environmental degradation and can significantly reduce air and water pollution. But not all products may not be good to reuse again particularly old plastic toys. Researchers at the University of Gothenburg Sweden have warned that old toys and dress-up items may contain toxic chemicals that can cause cancer disrupt growth and development in children and reduce their future reproductive capacities.

The researchers found hazardous chemicals such as phthalates and short chain chlorinated paraffins in about 84 per cent of old plastic toys and dress-up items that they tested. These chemicals are used as plasticizers and flame retardants in toys. They reported their findings in an article recently published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials Advances.

In many toys and items that they tested (both old and new) the chemical content was found exceeding the current legal limits. But the number was significantly higher in older toys and items (84 per cent) compared to the newer toys and items (30 per cent).

Further they found significantly higher concentrations of toxic chemicals in the older items. The concentrations of phthalates in many old balls constituted over 40 per cent of the toy's weight which is 400 times over the legal limit according to the researchers.

Need to regulate use of toxic chemicals in toys

Many countries regulate the chemical content in toys to protect the health and safety of children.

For example the EU's Toy Safety Directive have set the permissible limit for phthalates used in new toys at 0.1 per cent by weight while for short chain chlorinated paraffins it is 0.15 per cent by weight.

However this legislation is only applicable to new toys not old ones noted Daniel Slunge Environmental Economist at the University of Gothenburg.

In 2019 the Quality Council of India (QCI) conducted a testing survey of imported toys available in the markets of Delhi and NCR. About 67 per cent of the imported toys failed to meet the safety standards which included the admissible levels of chemicals such as phthalate heavy metals and physical safety properties.

Phthalates are identified as endocrine disruptors (EDs) that can cause hormonal imbalances. Exposure to phthalates has been linked to a range of health problems including asthma preterm birth attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and breast cancer.

Sadly while Indian authorities have made it mandatory for imported toys to meet the safety standards it remains voluntary for domestic toy makers in the country.

TRENDING NOW

As parents you can protect your children from these chemicals at some levels by choosing safe toys for them and paying attention to the items they come in contact with.",,,,,,,,,,,,
ABNB,Airbnb,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5haXJibmIuY29tL2Z1cnRoZXItYWZpZWxkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Further afield: Spreading the benefits of the travel revolution,"More than two years since the beginning of the pandemic travel is fundamentally different. What started as a largely experimental phase of remote working and increased flexibility has now cemented as a way of life for millions of people. Untethered from their offices to varying degrees many have been able to embrace a new form of living and travel that’s encouraging them to broaden their horizons and think beyond the confines of the traditional holiday escape. Workcations are increasingly common and many people have even taken up life as digital nomads.

In response communities across the Asia Pacific region are looking to make the most of this newfound willingness to step off the beaten path and are actively working to build more resilient diversified local economies through tourism. The gradual return of cross-border travel will likely have emerging destinations thinking about how they can grab a slice of the international tourism pie.

The way that people travel internationally is also changing and creating new opportunities for locals. Recent research commissioned by Airbnb and undertaken by YouGov* revealed not only a huge amount of enthusiasm among many travelers for international travel but also that people in many countries and regions were more open to traveling internationally during off-peak times of the year than they were before the pandemic. The survey also showed that many travelers were more open to the idea of combining work and travel while abroad.

As people continue to grapple with rising costs of living and inflation many are embracing hosting as a way of making ends meet keeping pace with mortgage repayments and earning income to deal with increasing costs of goods services and energy bills.

This heightened focus among both travelers and local communities on flexibility and fresh opportunities has led to a dispersal of travel beyond traditionally popular tourist destinations. This is something Airbnb has also been championing through the rollout of innovative new search tools such as Categories and I’m Flexible which actively encourage travelers to seek inspiration off the beaten path.

More communities are sharing in the benefits of this travel revolution allowing more people access to an economic lifeline through hosting. This report provides a snapshot of this tourism dispersal throughout much of the Asia Pacific as well as the communities that are emerging as beneficiaries of this ongoing change.

Across the region Airbnb is committed to working together with governments to help empower communities to seize the opportunities presented by the travel revolution for the benefit of all locals.

Embracing rural and regional destinations

Over the course of the pandemic as remote work and increased flexibility became the norm for millions of people travelers set their sights on picturesque rural destinations where they could connect with new communities and seek out fresh hidden gems.

On Airbnb non-urban nights booked have significantly increased for a number of countries and regions in the Asia Pacific when comparing the second quarter of 2022 with the pre-pandemic second quarter of 2019. Of particular note are:

Australia (up about 60 percent)

(up about 60 percent) India (up about 140 percent)

(up about 140 percent) South Korea (up more than 180 percent)

Malaysia and New Zealand also recorded increases.

Case study: Partnering with Shimizu Town Hokkaido Prefecture Japan In an effort to grow tourism foster connection and help drive economic revitalisation Airbnb partnered with the town of Shimizu in Hokkaido. As part of this initiative the Mayor of Shimizu also became a Host on Airbnb to help promote local tourism while the broader partnership was focused on tackling the issue of empty homes and empowering locals to take advantage of the growing popularity of longer trips that combine work travel and living.

Internal Airbnb data comparing Q2 2022 with Q2 2019 shows that a number of destinations outside major cities have seen considerable growth in searches which is providing locals with new avenues for earning income through hosting. Some examples include:

In India Haldwani recorded growth during this period of about 330 percent in addition to more than 270 percent in Jibhi.

In Japan Nasushiobara experienced an increase of more than 200 percent in terms of searches and Isumi saw growth of almost 160 percent.

In Australia searches more than doubled for Mount Field while New Zealand’s Levin recorded growth during this period of more than 130 percent.

Malaysia’s Marang experienced notable growth (more than double) as did Siquijor (up more than 280 percent) in the Philippines.

In South Korea Yeongdeok-gun recorded almost 580 percent growth and searches for Sancheong-gun’s increased by more than 560 percent.

Case study: Growing agritourism in Australia In 2020 Airbnb formed a partnership with Australian Regional Tourism to help farmers across the nation diversify their businesses by becoming farm stays and accommodating agritourism. The partnership involved a bespoke toolkit for farmers looking to earn extra income through hosting and was later expanded to include funding for the development of a National Agritourism Sector Development Plan.

More resilient local communities

As costs of living continue to rise the dispersal of travel and willingness among guests to venture further afield has created economic opportunities for people in communities that may traditionally have missed out.

In fact the typical earnings for non-urban Hosts on Airbnb was more in the second quarter of 2022 than they did during the same period in 2019 in a number of countries and regions across the Asia Pacific. For example:

Australia (more than doubled)

India (up almost 40 percent)

South Korea (more than doubled)

Malaysia (up by about a third)

New Zealand (increase of about 60 percent)

Many people across the Asia Pacific are turning to hosting as a way to harness the travel revolution in a way that directly benefits them and their families. Through hosting they’re combating rising costs of living working to secure their financial independence and making a tangible economic contribution to their local community.

Case study: Empowering rural women in India In August 2021 Airbnb and the Self-Employed Women’s Association of India (SEWA) expanded an existing partnership to include Ladakh. This partnership with SEWA an organization representing 1.5 million self-employed women living mostly in India’s rural areas is aimed at helping to provide livelihood opportunities for rural women through hosting while also fostering digital inclusion and driving economic revitalisation for the broader community.

Staying longer and driving connection

Not only are travelers eyeing destinations off the beaten path they’re also looking to stay longer allowing them to forge deeper connections with locals and help spur economic growth.

On Airbnb non-urban nights booked for long-term stays (28 days-plus) have dramatically increased for a number of countries and regions across the Asia Pacific when comparing the second quarter of 2022 with the pre-pandemic second quarter of 2019.

In particular this growth was more than double for Japan South Korea Australia and India with Thailand about doubling.

Among destinations outside the major cities that proved popular on Airbnb for long-term stays within their respective countries and regions in the second quarter of 2022 were:

Geelong Banora Point Mandurah and Bundaberg in Australia

Arambol Naggar Kullu Agonda and Almora in India

Dapa Panglao Dumaguete and Silang in the Philippines

Niseko/Kutchan Nago and Otaru in Japan

Kang-neung Jeju-si and Suncheon in South Korea

Ipoh Kuah Semenyih and Port Dickson in Malaysia

Kerikeri Wanaka Tauranga and Napier in New Zealand

Koh Pha Ngan Koh Lanta and Krabi in Thailand

Case study: Showcasing Bali to remote workers Airbnb has partnered with Indonesia’s Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy on a range of initiatives aimed at attracting digital nomads and remote workers to Bali as part of broader efforts to generate economic opportunities for locals. This initiative also includes collaborating on educational campaigns to promote responsible hosting and traveling.

The rise of conscious travel

As more emerging destinations develop tourism economies off the back of the travel revolution they’ll be looking to do so in ways that benefit locals and minimize negative impacts.

Fortunately it appears many travelers are also focusing on how they can ensure their trips are more positive and empowering experiences for the communities they visit.

The rise of the ‘conscious traveler’ is increasingly presenting an opportunity for communities to not only grow their local economies off the back of the travel rebound but also welcome an evolving form of empowering win-win tourism that emphasizes genuine connection.

Airbnb-commissioned research and analysis by Economist Impact** – which included surveying more than 4500 people across nine countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific – found:

More than two-thirds of people say it’s important to them that they’re creating a positive impact for locals with 58 percent saying it’s important that they’re not contributing to issues such as overtourism.

More than 60 percent of people are conscious that communities are in need of economic recovery and will factor this into where they travel and how they spend their money.

Almost 60 percent of people say they’ll be more conscious when it comes to familiarizing themselves with what’s important to the communities they’re visiting and how they can make a contribution.

Almost two-thirds of people place importance on using travel as a way to meaningfully connect with communities and culture with 60 percent believing it important that they immerse themselves in local communities.

Case study: Furthering sustainable tourism in Malaysia Airbnb and the Malaysian Green Technology and Climate Change Corporation (MGTC) signed a Memorandum of Understanding to jointly drive the country’s green growth agenda through a series of initiatives including education programs relating to sustainable hospitality practices and travel habits.

Case study: Showcasing Korean culture As K-wave continued to gain momentum across the world Airbnb partnered with the Korea Tourism Organization to promote uniquely Korean cultural experiences beyond South Korea’s borders through a series of Online Experiences on Airbnb. During a period when international travel was yet to return this collaboration also gave locals an additional avenue to earn income and stay afloat.

Spreading the benefits of the travel revolution

With the lines between travel and living continuing to blur it’s increasingly vital that everyone works together collaboratively to help ensure the resulting economic opportunities are spread more equitably than in the past.

In addition to encouraging travelers to explore further afield through innovative search tools such as Categories and I’m Flexible Airbnb also remains committed to partnering with governments communities and other stakeholders across the Asia Pacific region.

That's the slogan you'll see on Airbnb's website. Yet the reality is when an Airbnb is situated in a residential neighbourhood most people staying there may not be living as considerately as a local during their stay.

To clarify I’m not referring to shepherd-hut style lettings such as when someone with land sets up a novelty caravan yurt or similar on their grounds or if someone lets their spare room to guests via Airbnb. I’m concerned with entire flats or houses in residential areas being bought up as investment opportunities and let out all-year round through Airbnb or newer similar American site Vrbo.com standing for Vacation Rentals by Owner. Communities are affected by rows of these holiday let-style properties clogging up neighbourhoods and causing over tourism in some areas.

Rental costs and house prices soar in areas where second homes are purchased as demand pushes up market value. Cornwall is experiencing unmanageable housing issues largely due to the demand for second homes many made homeless as landlords cash in on this more lucrative form of letting. The reality is though there are not enough houses for people and allowing the mass purchase of homes in residential areas to be operated as Airbnb short-lets must be a sufficient factor generating that shortage.

Back in early 2019 pre-pandemic the house next door to our home in a waterside location in Plymouth was purchased as a Airbnb venture. That was the beginning of two years with an Airbnb next door. The property is no longer an Airbnb (thankfully) it changed hands again early in 2022 and a permanent resident moved it someone who actually lives there and is part of the community. At the time the home was purchased as an Airbnb the owners or 'hosts' as they're generally referred to knocked on the door to tell us about their plan. Describing it to be their holiday home but to also be advertised as an Airbnb let.

Needless to say my heart sunk however I assumed perhaps it would just be the odd short-let and not as daunting as it sounded. But the house was booked up most weeks and all-year round unless the owners who lived in the south east were staying for their occasional holiday it was a constant stream of Airbnb bookings. I thought of Cawsand and Kingsand on the Rame Peninsula I imagined how the community felt there when the first one or two Airbnbs moved in. These twin villages are now saturated with pretty pastel-coloured holiday homes most of which are owned by hosts who do not reside anywhere near that community.

Surprisingly perhaps although the hosts did not reside at the property they held a residents' parking permit despite PCC’s website stating: “The permit address must be the permit holder’s sole or main residence where they live for a minimum of four nights a week.” Visitors permits which residents can apply for so friends family and workers can park nearby when visiting were also given out to Airbnb guests despite conditions for use on PCC’s website stating: “These permits are not available to guests of hotels or guesthouses.”

I can’t help but wonder how common place this parking issue is with Airbnb in residential areas. Cornwall Council's terms and conditions for resident parking permits state: ""A resident is deemed to be someone who normally resides at the property this does not include landlords."" With the amount of Airbnbs in Cornwall I wonder how many owners of properties hold a residents' permit when they perhaps shouldn't - according to the council's criteria detailed on both Devon Cornwall and Plymouth's council websites. Devon County Council's website regarding residents parking permits states: ""Permits are usually issued to the full-time residents of the address for use on a vehicle which is also DVLA registered at that address. If your primary address is elsewhere you should not hold a resident permit.""

Although the Airbnb next-door was not used as a 'party house' as such some guests even families were loud and disruptive. One occasion when a group of lads stayed they were noisy into the early houses talking loudly banging about and another time several guys were sitting out the front of the property drinking in the early hours of the morning. Needless to say this disturbed us and other residents on our street. Often other visitors would join guests staying and the lounge with an adjoining wall to our lounge would become very noisy. Even turning the TV up didn't drown out loud guests sometimes we'd resort to banging on the walls as if we alerted the host he'd just say that the noise wasn't over the legal limit - apparently he had microphones inside the property to measure noise limits.

The houses in this location in Plymouth's East End are extremely compact and close together a terraced street dating back to the late 1800s that once homed fishermen's families. You really want to know and preferably like your neighbours in this community and be able to communicate easily with local residents. Unfortunately this was not really possible with an Airbnb next door. At the beginning I communicated complaints directly to the hosts but as issues built up so did hostility and eventually the hosts chose to ignore or become agitated with any grievances.

One occasion when a single man stayed he came back at around 5am with a woman - she was shouting out the front as we peered down from the upstairs window. A calm request for them to quieten down ended up with the woman hurling offensive abuse and swearing at us. That whole experience was stressful and infuriating as there's not a lot you can do.

Normally problem neighbours that cause disturbance can be reported to the council but with Airbnb lets because there are so many different people coming and going - a changeover every few days - it's a different situation because the issues are not ongoing with the same residents. As well as a steady stream of guests cleaners were in and out constantly meaning sometimes every three days or so there'd be a professional cleaner in there hoovering and banging cupboards.

Late check-ins were also a problem the hosts had 10pm advertised as the latest check in on their Airbnb page. Honestly I think 10pm is too late anyway in a residential area as there would be an hour or two after check-in when sounds of doors wardrobes and cupboards banging shut could be heard. The reality though guests checked in much later at times midnight 1am 2am. Generally it's a very quiet street and late check-ins drove us mad at times.

When one family arrived in summer 2021 after midnight they made so much noise suitcases banging through the front door clunking up the stairs car doors slamming. I was fuming to be woken up - again - by at this point a holiday let which had been next door for nearly two years. It felt like things would never change. I decided on this occasion to complain via Airbnb. When you message Airbnb the reply comes from a representative based in America.

This was the reply: ""It was unfortunate that you were disturbed. We never want that to happen. These particular guests had travel delays and it was never their intention to arrive as late as they did. Arriving at such a late hour to an unknown place with a small child is bound to cause a few suitcases to knock on the entrance area.""

It was similar whenever I brought other issues to the attention of Airbnb they were generally unhelpful. Often rubbish was left outside the property on days when it shouldn't be which causes issues with gulls swooping in and piercing bin bags. It was a constant headache dealing with small issues that became a big deal day-to-day. When the pandemic hit followed by lockdown in March 2020 one good thing that came out of it was the peace and quiet it brought as this mini 'hotel' next-door was not allowed to operate. Then in spring and summer 2021 when lockdown was lifted the bookings stacked up and the Airbnb was in high demand.

People seemed even more selfish post-pandemic some guests started to pull up in residents' parking happy to take the chance of getting a ticket to be right outside of the holiday-home. Occasional confrontation on parking caused some nasty tensions; the feeling was that relaxing at home was difficult. There was always the dread of who would check in next; would they be loud and inconsiderate like so many had been?

There must be so many residents across Devon and Cornwall living with this situation on a daily basis: an Airbnb next door with an attached key-safe by the door so guests can come and go at their ease. From my experience a holiday let next door affects normal day-to-day living as a resident in that community. I appreciate that Airbnb is convenient with families and larger groups able to book an entire property and 'live' in that residence for the duration of their stay but something needs to change before Airbnb gobbles up more communities.

It seems completely unfair that homes in seaside locations are now viewed as investment assets; some estate agents advertise these dwelling houses as 'an ideal property for a holiday rental'. When the Airbnb house next door went up for sale the ad read: ""This property has been successfully holiday let over recent years but would be a perfect 'first-time buy'.""

One major building society recently announced it would no longer lend to people purchasing a second home so maybe the tide is changing? Perhaps one day soon seaside communities can become 'real neighbourhoods' once more. Is it really too much to ask that homes for local people living in these communities must come first?

An Airbnb spokesperson said: “We are committed to being good partners to neighbours and took action with the Host at the time to help resolve the concerns reported to us. Our industry-leading dedicated 24/7 hotline for neighbours means anyone can contact us about a concern with a local listing at any time and we investigate and act on the reports received up to removing Hosts and guests from Airbnb. The overwhelming majority of our community are respectful neighbours and travellers and isolated issues are rare.”

East Japan Railway Company (JR East) has launched the Steam store page for JR EAST Train Simulator. The game is expected to be released in early access on September 20 (JST).



JR EAST Train Simulator is a train driving simulation game that is being published by Japanese train company JR East and developed by Ongakukan a company that creates professional simulators for business use. Players will be able to experience what it is like to drive trains on the real-life JR East lines. The game will first be available in early access and will include the following route segments:

– Hachiko Line (Kiha 110 Series) Upbound Takasaki – Kuragano (approx. 4 min. 4.4km)

– Keihin Tohoku Line (Series E233-1000) Southbound between Omiya and Yono (about 5 min. 2.7km)

When playing the game you first choose a line and train model before selecting which station along the route that you would like to begin from. There are three difficulty modes in the game and the Beginner difficulty displays an operation guide driving instructions and other helpful information that will make the game easier to enjoy for those who have never played a train driving sim before.





The game is being developed based on the professional simulator that is actually used by JR East drivers for training purposes. The visual scenery that is shown while driving is high-definition live action footage recorded on the JR East lines and the sounds heard from the trains running on the tracks use audio that was recorded using real-life trains. The instrument panel is a faithful replica that responds just like the real thing and there are a number of other meticulous details.

In April of this year four hotels in Japan were offering accommodation packages that included the ability to experience JR EAST Train Simulators that were set up within the hotels. It is unclear what connection these simulators have to the new game but both are developed by the same company: Ongakukan.

The game is expected to stay in early access for 2-3 months and while it will initially only include two routes as mentioned above in the full release “you will be able to change the routes you can drive and purchase DLC to drive longer distance sections.” The full release of the game is also expected to include support for external controllers.





The Steam page for JR EAST Train Simulator can be found here.

Allstate also has more than twice the level of complaints than the industry average per the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ complaint index.

Almost all of the extra protections and benefits at Allstate -- such as new car replacement or accidental forgiveness -- come with additional costs. The insurance giant has many discounts but not many extra services for free.

Allstate insurance cost

Allstate currently offers some of the highest premiums out of the auto insurance providers that CNET’s reviewed.

Minimum coverage per year at Allstate costs $558 a bit higher than the industry baseline of $545. A healthy list of discounts can bring down those costs but Allstate’s base rates are consistently higher than competitors’ right now.

Methodology

CNET reviews insurance carriers and products by exhaustively comparing them across set criteria. For auto insurance we examine average annual premium rates for full coverage consumer complaints collision repair scores the carrier’s financial strength auto claims satisfaction and overall customer satisfaction. Our data comes from a multitude of sources.

Auto insurance rates come from Bankrate which gathers data using Quadrant Information Services. We also use both J.D. Power annual surveys that collect data on customer auto claims satisfaction and overall customer satisfaction.

Consumer complaints are taken from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) which collects consumer complaints across states indexing complaints on a scale that takes into account the industry average. We collect the financial strength rating of each carrier from the A.M. Best Rating. Lastly we collected collision repair scores from the Crash Network Insurer Report Card which collects data from collision repair professionals including mechanics to gauge the quality of collision claims service from insurance carriers.

The first thing I must outline is that patience is needed. Rebuilds are far tougher than (especially younger) LSU fans are used to and year 1 of that rebuild is all about process and groundwork not results. Many of the games are going to suck. Your team is going to look at times like it doesn’t belong on the field and frankly even successful rebuilds will look like that. We learned nothing new about Brian Kelly or where his program will be headed tonight. Everyone relax.

Did LSU look like a good football team? No not remotely. Did LSU look like it did a year ago? It sure did in many ways eerily at times. The thing is at first that’s to be expected with a rebuild.

They did however look like the LSU we’re used to in that they opted for the drunkest silliest looney-toonsiest ending they could possibly have drawn up. Frankly beneath all of the success and the talent and the glory that has been one of LSU football’s most integral qualities. We all remember the Les Miles untimed down/12 men on the field game against Tennessee the 7 overtime Sickos Committee end-of-year celebration against Texas A&M and the clock review that got Les Miles fired after a win turned into a loss on the Plains. The fact of the matter is it’s weird here. It’s not like buttoned-up Notre Dame it’s drunk crazy and eccentric and boy does that translate to the field. It always has and it probably always will.

Welcome to LSU it ain’t changing for nobody.

GAME RECAP

The first half was an absolute slog. Jayden Daniels scrambled LSU down for a field goal but that was it for LSU’s offense in the first half as Daniels was very rattled in the pocket and the OL allowed pressure after pressure. On D they gave up a lot of movement particularly on 3rd down with FSU QB Jordan Travis expertly dissecting 3rd down pressure packages but only gave up a single touchdown on a trick play so the results weren’t terrible considering how well Travis played.

The second half was blind-drunk. FSU opened the half with a field goal LSU with a punt but then the game went absolutely ballistic. The teams then traded touchdowns 4 times (2 aside) to make it 24-17 FSU headed down the stretch. LSU finally came up with a 3rd down stop and looked to have a chance to go down and tie the game but WR Malik Nabers muffed and lost his SECOND punt of the game giving FSU the ball deep in LSU territory. FSU took it down to the one where they proceeded to FUMBLE AND LOSE THE FOOTBALL AT THE 1 YARD LINE. Now with 1:05 left and 2 timeouts LSU had to go 99 yards to tie this game. LSU’s offense managed to scramble fight and claw its way down the field. With time running low Daniels found talented freshman TE Mason Taylor who looked like he got out of bounds with just ONE SECOND left on the clock. Sike he didn’t they reviewed it and gave LSU time for ONE MORE PLAY as the clock stops with the moving chains and LSU got lined up during the profoundly long review. With the last play on the clock the line finally held up and Daniels found Jaray Jenkins for a clutch TD to make it 24-23 FSU.

Sadly you kinda have to do something after you score a touchdown don’t you? Instead of going for 2 and a possible win (which I’d have done) Kelly played it safe and opted for a PAT. Safe of course if you know how to protect a field goal attempt. Florida State EDGE Jared Verse who had a WHALE of a football game broke through the line and BLOCKED THE PAT. Game over FSU wins.

Florida State fell behind quickly after two penalties and a long run handed LSU a 3-0 head start. From there the Noles rattled off 17 straight points largely on the shoulders of Jordan Travis. FSU’s two big offensive plays both came from the combo Jordan Travis and Ontaria Wilson.

The first saw Wilson getting wide open following a reverse flea flicker for a 39-yard touchdown to take the 7-3 lead.

The second came late in the 3rd quarter as Wilson fought through defensive pass interference to make a one-handed grab for the score.

Both throws were part of an impressive night for Travis as he flashed with both his arm and his legs.

Bitcoin BTC/USD Bull and SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci says that his firm is investing heavily in Algorand ALGO/USD because he thinks the cryptocurrency will replace many of its competing blockchains.

In a recent interview he said that ALGO will challenge leading competitors in the crypto industry just like Alphabet Inc GOOGL did in the early days of the internet.

“I’ve got a quarter-billion dollars in Algorand right now. I think Algorand will be the Google” Scaramucci said.

In December 2021 he compared Algorand's potential to pass Ethereum ETH/USD in market cap to the opportunity that Google capitalized on bypassing its predecessors in the early stages of the internet.

Algorand is a blockchain-based crypto platform that focuses on security scalability and decentralization.

It is faster than Ethereum and offers lower transaction fees. ALGO also has a net-negative carbon footprint.

“I think ultimately when the big enterprises get on to the tokenization side of the market and they start working in the world of DeFi they’ll need something that’s scalable like Algorand secure like Algorand and ultimately decentralized so they won’t have to worry about capricious inflation-deflation of what it is that they’re using as a form of exchange of value” Scaramucci added.

He feels that Algorand is the future and it’s going to require more and more people doing deep-dive due diligence and making the decision to choose the blockchain.

During an interview in December of last year Scaramucci told CNBC his funds hold about $9 billion in assets with $1.3 billion of that consisting of crypto investments. Each fund has a 10% to 25% allocation to crypto.

According to the e-commerce giant “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power” was viewed by 25 million viewers globally over the initial 24 hours that the TV series’ first two episodes were available for streaming on Prime Video in 240 countries and territories.

Amazon’s “The Rings of Power” debuted globally Sept. 1 and Sept. 2 depending on what territory and time zone Prime customers were streaming from across the world. The first two episodes dropped at 6 p.m. PT/ 9 p.m. ET Thursday.

In its release announcing the “Rings of Power” premiere viewership Amazon did not specify how it measures a view nor how much of an episode a user needs to watch to count as a viewer.

Popular on Variety

With Amazon never before releasing numbers for a Prime Video series and only Nielsen’s Top 10 streaming data for popular series like “Reacher” and “The Boys” to use as a third-party benchmark for success for the streamer it’s hard to say just how big of a hit “The Rings of Power” is for Prime Video. However Amazon said Saturday that “Rings of Power’s” performance broke “all previous records marking the biggest premiere in the history of Prime Video.”

Though a fair comparison is nearly impossible to draw here based on self-reported metrics on Amazon’s part and a combo of Nielsen and proprietary streaming data on HBO and HBO Max’s side the TV industry at large is bound to compare the “Rings of Power” premiere with the U.S. launch of HBO’s “House of the Dragon” which premiered to a record-breaking nearly 10 million viewers Aug. 21 and grew its viewership by 2% with its second episode Aug. 28 (global figures were not disclosed). The “Game of Thrones” prequel has been pitted against the “Lord of the Rings” series since well before either debuted within two weeks of each other.

“It is somehow fitting that Tolkien’s stories – among the most popular of all time and what many consider to be the true origin of the fantasy genre – have led us to this proud moment” Jennifer Salke head of Amazon Studios said in a statement provided by Amazon along with the “Rings of Power” viewership numbers. “I am so grateful to the Tolkien Estate – and to our showrunners J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay executive producer Lindsey Weber cast and crew – for their tireless collaborative efforts and boundless creative energy. And it is the tens of millions of fans watching – clearly as passionate about Middle-earth as we are – who are our true measure of success.”

Costing a reported $465 million for its first season alone with a second season already in the works at Amazon the adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien’s work follows 23 series regulars during the lesser-known story of the Second Age of Tolkien’s Middle-earth.

Though “The Rings of Power” premiere has received much attention it hasn’t all been positive. Amazon’s ‘The Lord of the Rings” series appears to have been review bombed — a practice involving bad-faith users flooding intentionally negative reviews for a show or film — on sites like Rotten Tomatoes where it has an 84% rating from professional critics but a 35% from user-submitted reviews. (“The Rings of Power” has specifically faced backlash from some people who take issue with the decision to cast actors of color as elves dwarves harfoots and other folk of Tolkien’s fictional Middle-earth.)

As Variety reported Friday Prime Video user reviews of “The Rings of Power” are being held by Amazon for the first 72 hours post launch a delay implemented across the board for all Prime Video series earlier this summer that began around the time of the launch of “A League of Their Own.” The new procedure involves a hold that allows for reviews to be evaluated to determine whether they were created by a bot or troll.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDMvYW1hem9uLXRoZW1lZC13ZWRkaW5nLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtY291cGxlcy1sb3ZlLW9mLWUtY29tbWVyY2UuaHRtbNIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIyLzA5LzAzL2FtYXpvbi10aGVtZWQtd2VkZGluZy1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLWNvdXBsZXMtbG92ZS1vZi1lLWNvbW1lcmNlLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This couple had an Amazon-themed wedding to celebrate how e-commerce brought them together,"In this article AMZN Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT

Jing Gao and Eddie Levine have both worked in e-commerce for more than a decade. Eddie Levine

Eddie Levine and Jing Gao first met at an Atlanta e-commerce conference in 2016. Two years later they shared their first kiss outside an Amazon seller summit in New Orleans. And in 2020 Gao left her home in Los Angeles to move in with Levine in Chicago bringing their e-commerce businesses under one roof. So it only made sense that when it came time to tie the knot they turned to e-commerce for their inspiration. On Aug. 21 the couple tied the knot in Chicago and the wedding reception was filled with Amazon paraphernalia. At the reception guests were seated at tables designated by a ten-digit code used to look up products on Amazon's website (known as an ASIN in seller parlance). Wedding favors were tiny Amazon packages complete with barcodes and filled with treats placed in miniature shopping carts.

Attendees posed for photos in front of a backdrop declaring ""Jeddie (a combination of the couples' first names) Prime Day"" an homage to Amazon's annual summer shopping bonanza. Although the references were a little bit esoteric at least the couple was confident that some of their guests would understand them. Levine gave a toast during the reception. ""I said 'Last but certainly not least e-commerce brought us together. If we have met you as a result of e-commerce directly or indirectly stand up"" he told CNBC in an interview. ""Literally half of our guests stood up."" Not everyone got it though. ""The bartender was like 'Can you tell me what the deal is with all the Amazon-inspired stuff?"" said Robyn Johnson CEO of digital marketing agency Marketplace Blueprint and a friend of the couple who attended the wedding.

Getty Images

At several points of the year it's been easy -- natural almost -- to ask oneself a torrid question.

No not ""Can this world survive another year?"" Nor even ""Will we ever all get along?""

Instead it's been this: ""What on earth is going on inside airlines?""

Too many stories of abject customer despair keep emerging for anyone to think airline managements fully know what they're perpetrating. Or even partly.

Yet two separate elements have fused in my mind to make the question sliver in my entrails yet again.

First it was this. The Points Guy performed a little experiment where three of its writers flew on three different airlines. In business class.

Liam Spencer flew American Airlines and observed: ""I did think the crew could have been a little friendlier.""

If they're not friendly in business class can you imagine what it's like further back? Yet the second element that slid into my soul might offer some sort of counterbalance.

Over the last year or two I've experienced enormous sympathy for the cabin crew. Passenger behavior has sunk to the depths of baseball bleachers. Flight scheduling is such a painfully humorous affair that unions make films to scoff at it. Tales of flight attendants having to sleep inside airports abound.

How can it be then that one reads that American Airlines is apparently firing far more flight attendants than in any normal year?

Here's Paddle Your Own Kanoo echoing the words of the flight attendants' union -- the Association of Professional Flight Attendants -- which says it's never seen such a plethora of flight attendants confronting dismissal.

It appears that American Airlines is being rigid in enforcing rules in order to maintain some sort of discipline.

Something similar may have been mooted at United Airlines. United was very concerned its flight attendants had crooked ties and non-regulation pants. Which led the flight attendants union to offer the airline some strict truths about such finer elements as the supply chain and well the fact that airlines keep on slipping on more bananas.

In American's case it may seem odd bordering on pathological for an airline to be firing staff when -- as all airlines have -- it offers short-staffing as one of the reasons for flight cancellations.

It may seem extremely odd that an airline would be firing more of its customer-facing staff at the very time customers would love to be faced with any kind of service at all.

It may well be though that American hired too quickly without sufficient diligence concerning the people they were hiring. After all the airline let a lot of experienced flight attendants leave and again along with other airlines suddenly hired less experienced staff. (Or those with no experience at all.)

It may also be that passengers increasingly complained about certain aspects of American's service and this is the airline's reaction -- one that would please those passengers.

Then again maybe American sees a downturn approaching and is preparing the way.

Naturally I asked American and the flight attendants' union for their views. I'll update should either choose to fire back.

The driest of countenance might observe that if you're firing those who are among the lowest paid in your company there might -- just might -- be something imperfect about not only your hiring practices but your training abilities.

I wouldn't dream of suggesting that.

I'll just remind those who may have forgotten that American's tagline is: ""Caring for people along life's journey.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYW1lcmljYW4tZGlkLW5vdC1sZXQtdW5hY2NvbXBhbmllZC1taW5vci1nZXQtZm9vZC1kdXJpbmctbGF5b3Zlci0yMDIyLTnSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2FtZXJpY2FuLWRpZC1ub3QtbGV0LXVuYWNjb21wYW5pZWQtbWlub3ItZ2V0LWZvb2QtZHVyaW5nLWxheW92ZXItMjAyMi05P2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American didn't let an unaccompanied minor buy food during a layover,"An American Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

A teenager traveling alone for the first time was not allowed to buy food on a layover.

He was told by staff to stay with the group despite seeking permission multiple times.

He was left hungry on a near-two hour layover due to likely ""staff shortages"" his stepmom was told.

American Airlines did not allow a 15-year-old to buy food during a layover between flights after he asked staff for permission multiple times.

The teenager was flying unaccompanied from Jacksonville Florida where he was visiting his sister back home to Albany New York via Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.

The layover was supposed to be for an hour but ended up being almost two as his flight was delayed which Insider verified via flight details.

The incident is the latest involving American Airlines' treatment of unaccompanied minors reported by Insider amid a summer of travel chaos. The airline sent a 12-year-old child to the wrong state in June and it lost a child's passport in July.

Jennifer Roback the boy's sister told Insider that he was not allowed to get food from a shop in the terminal just a few feet away as he had to stay with a group of other unaccompanied minors at all times on the layover.

""He didn't have breakfast so he hadn't eaten all day and was just left hungry"" she said.

When the teen first asked the accompanying staff member he was told to ask someone else Roback said as that person was not the assigned leader. He then asked another person a few more times but was continually refused.

""I was upset about it because my brother's never flown alone before so it was a big trip for him"" she said. ""It bothers me that his way back wasn't great and I was angry for him.""

When his step-mom picked him up from Albany airport she went to the American Airlines desk to find out what happened. They apologized and told her it was probably due to staff shortages she said.

""I know that there have been a lot of staff shortages because of the pandemic but I feel like companies are now just trying to use that as an excuse"" Roback told Insider. ""It's one thing if someone closes a register at a grocery store but it's another thing when you deny children food.""

Roback messaged American Airlines on Twitter on August 8 about the incident and the airline responded: ""If your brother had money to grab a bite to eat our team should've had someone take him. DM his record locator and we'll pass this on.""

American Airlines did not respond to Insider's request for comment.

Flights used to be a chance to sit back (albeit a bit cramped) and watch a recently released movie or catch up on some reading. Now they’re just another place to log on.

Delta and United each host more than 1.5 million inflight WiFi sessions a month the airlines told CNN Business while JetBlue said its service is used by “millions of customers” every year. Southwest declined to share specific numbers but said inflight Wifi is “popular.”

Alaska Airlines meanwhile estimates that about 35% of its passengers on average make use of its $8 onboard WiFi services which include surfing the web and streaming.

While most airlines will allow certain messaging apps for free full internet access in the skies usually comes at a premium with Delta charging nearly $50 for a monthly pass on US flights (though the airline plans to switch to a $5 per flight per device offering by the end of this year). But with a market that’s currently estimated at around $5 billion and projected to grow to more than $12 billion by 2030 according to research firm Verified Market Research there’s a lot of room for improvement.

Inflight internet has been around for nearly two decades with aircraft manufacturer Boeing announcing its service known as Connexion in April 2000 and debuting it on a Munich-Los Angeles Lufthansa flight in 2004. Boeing discontinued the service in 2006 saying the market for it had “not materialized” as expected. But the advent of smartphones and subsequent efforts by a host of satellite providers and airlines have helped the technology evolve significantly in the past decade — though it still has some catching up to do in order to compare to home and office networks.

How it works

There are two main types of inflight connections. The first known as air-to-ground or ATG relies on antennae attached to the aircraft that catch the signal from cellphone towers on the ground.

Intelsat which launched air-to-ground services with American Airlines in 2008 currently operates a version of the technology on more than 1000 aircraft across North America.

The one major drawback of this technology is that much like cellphone service on the ground it is dependent on the density and connectivity of towers and so flights over rural areas deserts or large water bodies are likely to suffer drops in connectivity. The maximum speeds for these systems are currently around 5 megabits per second (which is shared by hundreds of passengers) according to Andrew Zignani a research director at technology intelligence firm ABI Research who specializes in wireless connectivity. By comparison median global download speeds for mobile and fixed broadband are around 30 megabits per second and 67 megabits per second respectively according to recent data from monitoring app Speedtest.

“To date the biggest issues have been speed limited availability gaps in coverage dropouts and price” Zignani told CNN Business.

That’s why airlines and providers are increasingly switching to satellite-based connections that are relatively less susceptible to interruptions because they can more effectively cover the entirety of the flight path from space and keep the signal active as it moves through the air.

That includes Intelsat which has a network of over 50 satellites serving airlines such as Alaska American Delta United Air Canada British Airways and Cathay Pacific.

“As regional jet fleets are refreshed we expect the majority to migrate to satellite-based solutions” Jeff Sare Intelsat’s president of commercial aviation told CNN Business.

Viasat another major provider used by several airlines around the world uses its own network of satellites that provide high-speed connectivity and is gearing up to launch another satellite constellation later this year. The company debuted its services with JetBlue in 2013 and now serves more than a dozen airlines around the world.

But even satellite connections are currently capable of around 100 megabits per second per aircraft or around 15 megabits per second per passenger device a far cry from the speeds terrestrial WiFi is capable of.

Many airlines use a combination of WiFi providers and types of technologies depending on the type of aircraft and routes they need to be deployed on.

Newer players such as Starlink the satellite internet service run by billionaire Elon Musk’s company SpaceX are also entering the fray. Earlier this year SpaceX announced a partnership with Hawaiian Airlines to provide high-speed internet through Starlink’s network of low-earth orbit satellites.

“Some of these solutions also adopt a hybrid approach combining the best of both technologies to ensure optimal coverage depending on the specific flight path” said Zignani. “I believe we will see opportunities for all technologies in the coming years and recent partnerships are showing that each technology will have its own part to play” he added.

Challenges and opportunities

There are still gaps between inflight WiFi and the networks you would use in your home office a coffee shop or anywhere on the ground.

While most airline WiFi connections now support messaging and social media functions and some even have live TV and video streaming capabilities providing users with the same level of bandwidth and connectivity mid-air can be a challenge.

“The biggest point of difference for inflight WiFi is the complexity added by the mobility element” Don Buchman vice president and general manager for commercial aviation at Viasat told CNN Business. “The aircraft is traveling at a high rate of speed typically banking during the flight and often flying across large geographical areas that demand consistent coverage for a high-quality in-flight connectivity experience.”

And while satellites solve for some of the restrictions that cellphone towers face expanding the satellite network to keep up with increasing demand is not always straightforward.

As Sare of Intelsat puts it: “It is much faster and cheaper to deploy new cellular towers than to launch a satellite on a rocket.”

In a survey by Intelsat last year of airlines service providers and equipment manufacturers 65% of respondents said they anticipate increases in the number of passengers who expect to be connected while flying. The two biggest impediments to increasing inflight WiFi adoption the survey indicated were the high price of the service and “poor internet connection.”

Companies such as Viasat Intelsat and Starlink continue to expand that capacity however launching more satellites every year in anticipation of the growing demand for their services. That added capacity will not only enhance the online experience for users but could also potentially give airlines more avenues to monetize and lower the price.

“One example is ad sponsored inflight WiFi so passengers can access WiFi for free and use it however they would like” Buchman said adding that Viasat is also exploring ways to use its connectivity services to help airlines with functions such as crew management and aircraft maintenance.

The biggest priority according to Sare of Intelsat is shortening the time it takes to make those technological advances happen and he foresees more partnerships between companies to help move the industry standard forward.

The aromas of airplane food are once again wafting through cabins at 35000 feet. From vegan meatballs to ice cream sundaes airlines are offering new options and old favorites to woo returning travelers. As the peak travel season fades and inflation weighs on household and company budgets it's even more important than usual for airlines to court passengers. Airplane food a favorite travel punchline for comedians is hardly the top reason why travelers choose a carrier — price and schedule are much stronger factors. But it can be a creature comfort on board and can go a long way toward winning over passengers especially those who are willing to pay up for premium seats analysts say. ""Food is one of the most tangible signals of what an airline thinks of its customers"" said Henry Harteveldt founder of travel consulting firm Atmosphere Research Group and a former airline executive. The start of the Covid-19 pandemic halted almost all food and beverage service on flights as travel collapsed and airlines limited crews' contact with passengers to avoid spreading the virus. The pandemic drove airlines to record losses and had them looking to cut costs wherever possible such as in-flight food. With travel returning airlines around the world are rolling out new menu options. Alcohol sales with some new ready-to-drink options are back on board in U.S. coach cabins. And face masks are now mostly optional removing an obstacle to onboard food and beverage service. As tastes change and airlines face supply chain challenges the meal on your seat-back tray table is making a comeback — with some adjustments.

Chasing high-paying travelers

Better in-flight menus can boost a carrier's image and help it bring more high-paying travelers on board. First- and business-class customers are becoming even more of a prize as airlines try to recover from the pandemic's financial impact. Because of ""the incentive to win those premium class passengers the incentive to spend more money [on food] is high"" said Steve Walsh partner at management consulting firm Oliver Wyman in its transportation and services practice. Still food and beverage costs make up just about 3% of a full-service airline's expenses he estimated.

While food is for sale in many domestic coach cabins and is generally complimentary on long-haul international flights many of the new offerings target those in premium classes where there are fewer passengers and service is more elaborate. A plethora of videos have been posted online by airline passengers reviewing meals plating and service in detail. Popular staples such as Biscoff cookies and Stroopwaffel treats garner loyal followings and come to be expected by many travelers. Missteps on the menu or service are amplified on social media by disappointed travelers. One offering: Delta is serving passengers on long-haul international flights a new sundae-in-a-cup premixed with chocolate cherries and spiced Belgian cookies called speculoos which are known in North America as Biscoff cookies. ""Obviously it is an homage to the Biscoff"" said Mike Henny Deltas' managing director of onboard services operations. In more premium cabins such as Delta One on international flights passengers can build their own sundaes with a choice of toppings including Morello cherry compote chocolate sauce and speculoos cookie crumbles.

Delta in July said the revenue recovery in premium products and its extra-legroom seats was outpacing sales from standard coach — further motivation to introduce new and exciting food items. Last week the airline said it is teaming up with James Beard Award winner Mashama Bailey executive chef of Savannah Georgia-based restaurant The Grey for ""Southern-inspired"" meals on flights out of Atlanta for domestic first-class passengers. Travelers on Delta One flying internationally out of the hub can also preorder menu items curated by Bailey. Airlines for years have teamed up with celebrity chefs to design their menus and lately have been working more with local businesses. In February American Airlines brought Tamara Turner's Silver Spoon Desserts' Bundt cakes on board domestic premium cabins.

Veggie and vegan

Even before the pandemic airlines were expanding options for travelers who prefer vegetarian and vegan meals. Now those types of alternative dishes are getting an even closer look. ""Pasta isn't always the solution"" said Delta's Henny. Singapore Airlines a carrier that operates some of the world's longest flights brought in Southern California-based luxury spa Golden Door to develop dozens of recipes for its in-flight menu. Golden Door's executive chef Greg Frey Jr. focuses on vegetable-forward dishes that he says are among the best for digestion on flights. ""I think people are rightly so concerned they're not going to feel as satiated with this vegetarian meal and [think] 'I just need this piece of meat.' And in the end ... you really don't need that much protein when you're sitting in an airplane and relaxing"" he said. ""It's not like you're heavy lifting.""

An hour later you're not going 'Ugh I wish I didn't have the meatballs.'"" Greg Frey Jr. executive chef at Golden Door

Frey developed a Portobello mushroom ""meat ball"" dish that's served with a risotto made with vegetable broth. The mushroom balls are steamed and served with an heirloom tomato sauce: ""There's not a lick of meat in there"" he said. ""It's so satisfying and you get all those umami flavors"" he said. ""The best part is an hour later you're not going 'Ugh I wish I didn't have the meatballs.'""

Supply chain puzzle

Greens and salads are among the most difficult dishes to serve on board. Airline chefs have to make sure ingredients are hardy enough to endure transportation and refrigeration making stronger greens such as kale a better option than some more delicate varieties. ""We have to be very choosy about what type of greens we offer"" said American Airlines spokeswoman Leah Rubertino. ""Arugula for example is not our friend."" The airline is offering salads on more flights compared with before the pandemic Rubertino said. The airline is also now offering a ""fiesta grain bowl"" with rice quinoa black beans cauliflower corn and zucchini as a vegetarian option in many first-class cabins for domestic flights. Airlines have been trying to source vegetables more locally giving their catering companies fresher ingredients and cutting down on transportation time and costs. Singapore Airlines since 2019 has been using greens from AeroFarms a vertical farm near Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. Spokesman James Boyd said the airline has plans to source from other vertical farms close to the major airports it serves in the coming years.

Why activists in New York Maine and elsewhere are pushing for public power.,"For Daniel Atonna access to utilities is a personal matter.

Atonna who grew up in New York's Hudson Valley said his family couldn't always afford to heat their home. On some nights when the heat wasn't running he and his sister accompanied their mother to her overnight shifts at a nearby nursing home. The two would sleep in the facility's lobby ensuring they were able to stay warm.

Now 24 years old Atonna said his family's experiences with privately owned power companies have in part inspired his work organizing for a different system in New York: Publicly owned and government-operated utilities.

""These private utilities are not up to the task"" Atonna said. ""They can't even maintain the current energy grid let alone get us prepared for the future.""

Atonna is political coordinator of For The Many a grassroots organization championing progressive causes across The Empire State. The first step toward a new statewide energy economy he said could be the Build Public Renewables Act. The legislation passed the state Senate in June but the Assembly failed to take up a vote before the end of its latest session leaving the bill in limbo.

The act if signed into law would expand the reach of the New York Power Authority a state-owned utility that provides power to public buildings and schools. It would allow the utility to serve businesses and homes across the state requiring an eventual transition to exclusively renewable energy sources and significant infrastructure investments.

The New York act is one of many efforts across the nation to implement publicly-owned sources of energy. Such utilities generate about 10% of the country's electricity according to the American Public Power Association and supporters are looking to increase that percentage.

Activists are rallying in other states too – including Illinois Massachusetts and Michigan.

Organizers at municipal and state levels say the practice would eliminate the incentivization of profit that comes with privately-owned utilities while also allowing customers to more easily hold companies accountable for their service.

Opponents meanwhile remain concerned about the costs of investments associated with a shift to public power and many doubt whether such a model would fulfill its promises.

""With major projects in the works from private investors and the benefits that consumers see there is no reason to shake that up by allowing NYPA into the fold"" Gavin Donohue president of trade association Independent Power Producers of New York said in a statement. ""Why change up the competitive procurement process when private independent energy companies are more than willing to continue investing in New York?""

The history of US public power utilities

To trace the history of public utilities it's important to start with the first American power grids created in the 1880s.

At first electricity was a luxury afforded only to the rich through private utilities according to Michael Menser the director of Urban Sustainability Studies at Brooklyn College. But it didn't take long before access expanded with towns constructing their own grids for both private and public utilities he said.

CLIMATE POINT:Subscribe to USA TODAY’s free weekly newsletter on climate change the environment and the weather

Throughout the next few decades public power grids became more widespread with large expansions into the beginning of the 1920s. But soon after their fate would change as private utilities rapidly began buying up their public counterparts Menser said.

While public grids do still exist nearly a century later – most notably in Nebraska the only state served wholly by a consumer-owned power system – Menser told USA TODAY he's seen a recent resurgence in the push to create more such utilities.

Though Menser identified a range of possible explanations for the shift he described racial disparities in service and climate activism around renewable energy as primary drivers.

""When climate change intensifies storms and fires have also increased"" Menser said . ""In many cases private utilities don’t seem to be accountable after the event. So that's another thing that made people realize we need a much more accountable entity.""

A governor's veto in Maine

Wil Thieme became interested in the issue of public utilities after realizing it centered two subjects he cared about: Monopoly ownership and sustainability.

Thieme of Cumberland Maine learned about the push for public power in July 2021 and has since been elected as a co-chair of the Maine Public Power campaign.

Democratic Gov. Janet Mills vetoed a bill in July 2021 that would have with voter approval authorized the replacement of the state's two largest electricity companies with a publicly owned utility. In her veto letter Mills expressed concerns about the legislation’s plans for financing and regulation.

""There may be a way to create a utility with a professional governing board that is clearly eligible to issue low-interest tax-exempt bonds that would save ratepayers money achieve better connectivity with solar and other renewables and further the climate goals of this Administration"" Mills wrote at the time. ""But L.D. 1708 hastily drafted and hastily amended in recent weeks without robust public participation is a patchwork of political promises rather than a methodical reformation of Maine’s complicated electrical transmission and distribution system.""

Since then Thieme told USA TODAY that Maine Public Power has been collecting signatures in support of a statewide referendum that could overturn Mills' veto. They're facing strongopposition from privately owned utility companies he said.

""They lobby aggressively against anything that could potentially hurt their profits"" Thieme said. ""It's not great when you're trying to get real progress so a change is going to be very helpful in terms of getting climate bills passed.""

The opposing viewpoint: Private utilities could provide the most effective path to meeting sustainability goals.

CLIMATE CHANGE? The Inflation Reduction Act's surprise winner the U.S. oil and gas industry.

""To achieve our climate and grid modernization objectives we need everyone working together"" John Flynn president of statewide utility Versant Power said in legislative testimony in May 2021. ""We don’t have time or money to waste on polarizing fights.""

Marie Therese Kane an organizer with We Power D.C. said many members of the public power movement joined looking to take drastic steps to address climate change. With a public utility company Kane said there is a unique opportunity for direct accountability especially in meeting climate goals that doesn’t exist to the same extent in a privatized system.

​​""A lot of folks are disenchanted by traditional environmental organizations’ focus on individual behavior change or incremental units – efforts that don't account for the political reality"" Kane told USA TODAY. ""The movements for public power have an opportunity in something that can attack the systemic causes of something like climate change.""

A fight 'worth fighting' in New York

The supporters of public power still face significant obstacles – even after sparking conversation at some statehouses.

In New York for example the opposition to additional public utilities starts in the organization that activists are trying to expand. Justin Driscoll NYPA’s interim president and Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul’s nominee to fill the permanent role opposes the Build Public Renewables Act much to the chagrin of organizers.

""NYPA does not believe that we have a cost advantage in developing renewable generation"" Driscoll said in a July special hearing discussing the act. ""The bill's mandates like those directing NYPA to develop renewable energy projects and provide energy services and imposing limits on what NYPA may charge for that power are simply unworkable.""

Still for Atonna the need for public utilities in New York – and the passage of the Build Public Renewables Act – remains clear.

""This is really an agency that is uniquely positioned to do some amazing things right now"" he said. ""What we need to do is unleash its full potential.""

And then what?

""Just because something is public doesn't necessarily mean it's good"" said Aaron Eisenberg 31 another member of Public Power New York. “But the fight for a democratically accountable public institution and utility? That's worth fighting for.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZWFydGhvYnNlcnZhdG9yeS5uYXNhLmdvdi9pbWFnZXMvMTUwMjk3L3RoZS1nZXlzZXJzLW9mLWNhbGlmb3JuaWHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Geysers of California,"About 1.3 million years ago a large blob of silica-rich magma forced its way through Earth’s crust beneath the Coast Range of northern California. Today that shallow rock body is still piping hot and the 45-square-mile area above it is known as The Geysers—the world’s largest energy producing geothermal field.

Although the nearby Clear Lake volcanic field was still erupting as recently as a few thousand years ago there were never any geysers at this geothermal field. The Geysers is a misnomer that came from 19th century settlers to the area who misunderstood the hot springs and fumaroles bubbling and steaming away in the canyon of Big Sulphur Creek. From the mid-19th to the mid-20th century a popular resort hotel operated in the area while indigenous people of the region have visited the springs since prehistoric times.

Situated about 8 miles (13 kilometers) northeast of Geyserville the site is now home to 18 power plants that use steam to drive turbines to generate electricity. The white roofs of several of the power plants appear in this natural-color image acquired by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 on January 10 2022.

The steam-driven turbines in this area can generate 725 megawatts of electricity enough to power a city the size of San Francisco. The Geysers typically supplies the power needs of Sonoma Lake and Mendocino counties as well as a portion of Marin and Napa counties. As of 2018 turbines in the Geysers area produced 50 percent of California’s geothermal power.

Geothermal energy is produced by capturing heat from within the Earth either via natural steam or very hot water. It is a reliable and renewable source of energy that can be available whether or not the Sun is shining or the wind is blowing.

Three elements are needed to produce geothermal energy: magma close to the surface fractured or permeable rock and fluids that can circulate through the heated rock. At The Geysers the body of rock that intruded over a million years ago lies just 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) below the surface. Deeper parts below 1.5 miles (2.5 kilometers) can reach temperatures of 750°F (400°C).

While most geothermal power plants tap into water reservoirs the Geysers system is one of only two vapor-dominated systems in the world according to the U.S. Geological Survey. This means the formation produces steam directly which can more efficiently be tapped to produce electricity.

A small steam-engine generator was first used to produce electricity here in the 1920s and the first modern geothermal well was drilled in 1955. Over several decades further drilling and development by various operators brought The Geysers to its peak-production in 1987 when 21 power plants had a capacity of more than 2000 megawatts. Then power production began to decline as the steam reservoir began to tap out.

In the mid-1990s to sustain energy production and extend the life of the field plant operators turned to a practice called enhanced geothermal systems (EGS). Water is injected at high pressure to reopen the natural fractures in the rock and allow hot water or steam to flow into wells. Today two pipelines deliver treated wastewater from Lake County and the city of Santa Rosa to recharge the reservoir.

The shutdown was triggered by a reactor coolant pump motor the company said. No radioactive matter was released and it was not classified as an emergency according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

The reactor coolant pump motor failed due to ""a fault in a power cable connector"" Indiana Michigan Power said in a news release Sunday. ""Operators safely restored the unit to service once the connector repair was completed.""

There were no service interruptions as a result of the reactor shutdown and while the connector was repaired Indiana Michigan Power said. A second nuclear reactor at the Cook plant remained operational at full capacity while the other unit was out of service.

All systems functioned properly after the reactor shutdown according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Auxiliary feedwater pumps started properly and decay heat or energy that continues to be released after a reactor shuts down was removed from the system using the steam dump system.

""Plant operators followed proper protocols to safely remove the reactor from service"" Indiana Michigan Power said. ""The unit trip was noncomplicated.""

The reactor coolant pump that triggered the shutdown helps transfer and remove heat generated in the nuclear reactor core.

""When certain systems have an issue like in this instance it was a reactor coolant pump ... the unit automatically shuts down operators are there to put the unit in a safe condition in a full shutdown"" Cook representative Bill Downey said last week.

The Cook nuclear plant owned and operated by Indiana Michigan Power a unit of American Electric Power sits on 650 acres along the shores of Lake Michigan near Bridgman in Berrien County. At full capacity the two nuclear reactors produce enough electricity to power over 1.5 million homes according to the plant's website.

Pierluigi Paganini September 04 2022 September 04 2022

Cybersecurity firm Armorblox discovered a new phishing campaign aimed at American Express customers.

Armorblox researchers uncovered a new phishing campaign that is targeting American Express customers.

The messages use a malicious attachment and their content attempt to trick cardholders into opening it.

The subject of the emails reads “Important Notification About Your Account” in an attempt to urge recipients to open it. Once opened the email appears as a legitimate email communication from American Express while the content instructs the cardholder on how to view the secure encrypted message attached.

“Upon opening the attachment victims were greeted with a message announcing additional verification requirements for the associated account. Urgency was instilled within the victims through the inclusion of the language “This is your last chance to confirm it before we suspend it” and a prompt for victims to complete a one-time verification process that was needed as part of a global update from the American Express team.” reads the analysis published by the Armorblox.

Upon clicking on the link in the message victims are redirected to a fake American Express login page which includes the company’s logo and a link to download the American Express app.

The page was crafted to request the victims to enter their user ID and password.

The phishing campaign bypassed native Google Workspace email security controls because it passed both DKIM and SPF email authentication.

Threat actors behind the campaign used a valid domain to send this malicious email the domain used by the sender received a reputation score of trustworthy and global threat history of zero security events. The phishing email marked by Google as safe was delivered to more than 16000 users’ addresses.

Below are the recommendations provided by Armorblox to identify phishing messages:

Augment native email security with additional controls;

Watch out for social engineering cues;

Follow multi-factor authentication and password management best practices;

Last night the Greatest of All Time lost to Ajla Tomljanović in the third round at the US Open.

Throughout the three-hour match the adoring New York City crowd roared in cheers for Williams as she showed again and again why she is the GOAT. But at the end Tomljanović who is considered 46th in the world beat Williams 7-6 6-7 6-1 in what would instantly become an iconic and bittersweet defeat.

In the last minute Williams hit a ball to the net giving Tomljanović her winning point. With tears streaming down her face the tennis pro put her hand over her heart and took in the crowd. In the stands fans including Bella Hadid Ciara Gayle King and Spike Lee clapped cheered and cried with her while giving her a standing ovation. Williams twirled her signature twirl and gave a final wave before stepping off the court to Tina Turner's ""Simply the Best.""

Harper's BAZAAR was among the attendees last night at the stadium's American Express Center Court Club where screens zoomed in on Williams as she gave an emotional post-match interview on the court.

""Oh my god thank you so much you guys were amazing today"" she said. ""Thank you Daddy I know you're watching. Thanks Mom. Thank you everyone that's here that's been on my side—so many years literally decades. But it all started with my parents and they deserve everything. So I'm really grateful for them.""

Tim Clayton - Corbis // Getty Images

""These are happy tears I guess. I don't know"" she continued. ""And I wouldn't be Serena if there wasn't Venus so thank you Venus. She's the only reason Serena Williams ever existed ... It's been a fun ride. It's been the most incredible ride and journey I've ever been on.""

In her court interview Tomljanovic too praised Williams.

""I'm feeling really sorry just because I love Serena just as much as you guys do. And what she's done for me for the sport of tennis is incredible"" she said calling the moment—her first time passing the quarterfinals at any major—""surreal.""

""I just thought she would beat me. ... She's Serena. That's that's just who she is: She's the greatest of all time. Period"" Tomljanovic added.

American Express who is offering immersive tennis experiences and fine dining throughout the US Open for members in their Centurion suite spoke to BAZAAR about what it was like hosting fans for Williams's final match. ""Our Card Members know when they're with Amex they have access to life’s unforgettable and epic moments like last night’s history-making match. The energy in Arthur Ashe was off-the-charts and will certainly go down as a 'member when' experience for our Card Members"" they said.

Williams announced her retirement from tennis last month in an emotional essay published on Vogue in which she wrote candidly about the point she is at in her life—and the balancing act she plays every day trying to be both the world-renowned star athlete she is on the tennis court and the mom and wife her family needs her to be. She said that though it was not an easy choice to make she is ready for the next phase and looking forward to expanding her family.

""I don't want it to be over but at the same time I'm ready for what's next"" she wrote. ""I don't know how I'm going to be able to look at this magazine when it comes out knowing that this is it the end of a story that started in Compton California with a little Black girl who just wanted to play tennis. This sport has given me so much.""

""But I'm not looking for some ceremonial final on-court moment"" she added. ""I'm terrible at goodbyes the world's worst. But please know that I am more grateful for you than I can ever express in words. You have carried me to so many wins and so many trophies. I'm going to miss that version of me that girl who played tennis. And I'm going to miss you.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9yZXZpZXctcHJpbWVjbGFzcy1kb21lc3RpYy1sb3VuZ2UtYXQtbWlsYXMtYm9kcnVtLWFpcnBvcnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: The Primeclass Domestic Lounge At Milas Bodrum Airport,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9yZXZpZXctcHJpbWVjbGFzcy1kb21lc3RpYy1sb3VuZ2UtYXQtbWlsYXMtYm9kcnVtLWFpcnBvcnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWFuZGxldHNmbHkuY29tL2RlbHRhLWpmay1sb3VuZ2UtY3Jvd2Rpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hilarious: Lines So Bad At Delta SkyClub Passengers Are Fed While Waiting Outside,"This really cracks me up. The crowding is apparently so bad at the Terminal 4 Delta SkyClub in New York (JFK) that passengers are being fed while waiting in line to get in.

Delta Feeding Passengers As They Brave Long Lines To Enter Delta SkyClub Lounge (Hilarious Crowding…)

As usual the lines to get into the Terminal 4 Delta SkyClub at JFK are horrible:

Wowza – just leaving but this is the current line to get into the @delta #SkyClub at JFK. pic.twitter.com/33eNx56zi4 — Jonathan Jacobs (@JonEJacobs) September 2 2022

But this caught my eye…apparently Delta is bringing snacks outside the club while people are waiting.

I had a similar experience on Sunday. It moved pretty quickly though and they brought some snacks from the club while we were waiting. I was surprised how easy it was to find a seat once I got inside tbh — Zach Wichter (@zlwichter) September 2 2022

I’m not so sure that’s a great idea since it might encourage even more people to get in line including some who will indulge in the snacks knowing they will be turned away when they reach the front of the line. It seems like almost every time I use an airport lounge I see people being turned away. Airlines like Delta should do a better job of having a “line monitor” letting people know that domestic first class tickets or American Express Gold cards do not include lounge access.

There is no ultimate end in sight to this lounge crowding as both Delta and American Express continue to market co-branded cards that come with lounge access and of course the American Express Platinum card also comes with SkyClub access when flying on Delta.

The good news for crowding is that after Labor Day we should see a drop in travel which will result in fewer travelers at airports across the nation. Flights might not feel any different because carriers will offer reduced schedules during the winter season but I do not expect airports and lounges to be quite as crowded.

That said the bottlenecks will continue at certain lounges like the JFK SkyClub in Terminal 4. This daily occurrence of long lines is a clear sign that Delta must find more to expand its lounge operations.

CONCLUSION

Poor Delta poor us…the lounge crowding is so bad that apparently the airline is feeding passengers while they are waiting to get in! As we enter the shoulder season let’s hope this problem becomes less prevalent. But if you’re looking for a “free” snack at JFK well…

INSIDE THE SERIES: USA VS. NIGERIA

The USA and Nigeria are set to meet for the second time in two years though this will be just the seventh matchup all-time between the nations and only the second such meeting in a friendly match. The first five matchups between the USA and Nigeria all came at world championship events with four meetings at the Women’s World Cup (1999 2003 2007 and 2015) and one at the Olympics (2000).





Apart from a 7-1 win in the first ever meeting between the teams – which came in group play at the 1999 Women’s World Cup – and a 5-0 victory for the Americans in the 2003 World Cup group stage the majority of the meetings between these two countries have been tightly contested. The USA defeated Nigeria 3-1 at the 2000 Olympics and registered a pair of 1-0 group stage wins over the Super Falcons at both the 2007 and 2015 World Cups.



The most recent matchup between the two sides came on June 16 2021 in Austin Texas as the teams met in the first-ever soccer match at Austin’s FC’s spectacular Q2 Stadium. Christen Press scored the first-ever goal in that venue and Lynn Williams added a score off a counterattack for the 2-0 win for the Americans. The USA out-shot Nigeria 15-7 in that match though only six of the 23 players on this roster saw action in that 2021 match against the Super Falcons.



The USWNT has a perfect record against African opposition defeating Nigeria six times in six meetings and South Africa twice in two games. The USWNT has kept clean sheets in each of its last six games against CAF foes.

KANSAS CITY CONNECTIONS

The USWNT has several Kansas City connections on its roster for the match at Children’s Mercy Park with no one more intertwined with the city than head coach Vlatko Andonovski who has been a Kansas City resident for 18 years. Andonovski first came to Kansas City to play professional indoor soccer with the Kansas City Comets and also five years as head coach of FC Kansas City (2013-2017) who he led to back-to-back NWSL Championships in 2014 and 2015. Two players on this USA roster played for Andonovski on FC Kanas City in team captain Becky Sauerbrunn and midfielder Kristie Mewis. Mace who is looking to earn her first caps with the USWNT since 2018 presently plays for the Kansas City Current who are in the midst of a 12-game unbeaten streak.

ALL EYES ON AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND

With the opening match of the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup less than a year away 22 teams have already qualified for the tournament which has been expanded to now feature 32 teams up from 24 in both 2015 and 2019. The nations that have already punched their tickets Down Under are co-hosts Australia and New Zealand South Korea Japan China PR Philippines and Vietnam from Asia and Sweden France Denmark and Spain from Europe the USA Costa Rica Canada and Jamaica from Concacaf Zambia Morocco Nigeria and South Africa from Africa and Brazil Colombia and Argentina from South America. This will be the first Women’s World Cup at any level the Philippines and Vietnam who qualified through the AFC Asian Women’s Cup as well as Morocco and Zambia who qualified through the Africa Women’s Cup of Nations. Still to be filled are seven remaining slots from Europe and three slots from the 10-team playoff tournament that will feature two teams from Asia (Chinese Taipei and Thailand) two from Africa (Cameroon and Senegal) two from Concacaf (Haiti and Panama) two from South America (Chile and Paraguay) one from Oceania (Papua New Guinea) and one from Europe.

The USA has qualified for its ninth consecutive FIFA Women’s World Cup having played in every tournament since the competition’s inception in 1991 and winning a record four titles. Brazil Japan Sweden and Nigeria have also qualified for a ninth Women’s World Cup and German and Norway can join that group as well if they successfully qualify for Australia/New Zealand.



The draw for the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup will be held on October 22 in Auckland as all the competing nations will find out their first round schedules and path through the tournament.



The USA also qualified for an eighth consecutive Summer Olympics by virtue of its 1-0 win over Canada in the Concacaf W Championship final. The USA Sweden and Brazil are the only nations to appear in every edition of the Olympic Women’s Football Tournament since its inception in 1996.

BACK IN THE U-S-A



After playing all five games of the 2022 Concacaf W Championship in Monterrey Mexico the USA returns to action on home soil with a 69-game home unbeaten streak which includes 62 wins and seven draws and has now spanned more than five years. During this home unbeaten streak the USA has outscored its opponents 260-28 including a 127-2 margin during its last 30 matches at home all of which have been wins save for the 0-0 draws with Czech Republic on Feb. 17 and with Korea Republic on Oct. 21 2021. This is the second-longest home unbeaten streak in USWNT history the longest lasting 104 games from December of 2004 to December of 2015.

The USA also enters the two-game series against Nigeria on an 11-game win streak dating back to its second match of the year against New Zealand. During the 11-game winning streak the USA has outscored its opposition 46-1 and has kept eight consecutive clean sheets. The current eight-game shutout streak is the team’s longest since keeping eight consecutive clean sheets to open 2020 while the current 11-game win streak is the USA’s second-longest win streak in Andonovski’s tenure.

SEPTEMBER AT HOME OCTOBER ABROAD



With less than a year until the start of the 2023 World Cup in New Zealand and Australia Saturday’s matchup against the Super Falcons kicks off a fall of high-profile matches for the USA. Following the games against Nigeria who has also qualified for the World Cup 2023 the top-ranked Americans will travel across the pond for an October 7 meeting against recently crowned European Champions England at historic Wembley Stadium.

England won the 2022 UEFA Women’s EURO in historic fashion at Wembley Stadium on July 31 defeating Germany 2-1 in overtime on a goal from forward Chloe Kelly in front of a record-setting crowd of 87192 fans. Tickets for USA-England as many as 80000 of them sold out in less than a day and the crowd will be the largest to ever watch the USWNT in a friendly match. The USA-England match is subject to England securing its FIFA Women’s World Cup qualification during the September international window which they are very likely to do. England just needs to earn a point away against nearest group rivals Austria on Saturday September 3 or failing that a victory at home over Luxembourg on Tuesday September 6 to confirm their spot in Australia and New Zealand next summer. This will be the USWNT’s first visit to Wembley Stadium since the gold medal match at the 2012 Olympic Games a 2-1 victory for the USA over Japan and the first-ever meeting between the United States and England Women’s National Teams at London’s green cathedral of soccer

NIGERIA ROSTER NOTES

Nigeria has players playing eight different countries around the world and has 12 players playing professionally outside of Nigeria and two in college in the USA. Just six players on the roster are currently playing in Nigeria.

Nigeria has called up three players who were a part of its team at the recently completed FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup in Costa Rica in defenders Deborah Abiodun and Blessing Demehin and midfielder Esther Onyenezide. Nigeria won Group C in Costa Rica but fell to the Netherlands 2-0 in the quarterfinals. Nigeria beat France South Korea and Canada in group play. Against Canada Onyenezide scored twice from the penalty spot and against South Korea she bagged the game winner.

Nigeria earned its berth to the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup by advancing to the semifinals of the 2022 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations that was held in Morocco. In the semifinal Nigeria fell in penalty kicks to the hosts in front of 45562 fans in Rabat after a 1-1 tie during regulation and overtime. Nigeria finished that game with nine players after receiving two red cards.

The Super Falcons then fell in the Third-Place Match 1-0 to Zambia to finish an uncharacteristic fourth in the WAFCON but that is also indicative of the growth of the women’s game on the African continent. Zambia’s goal was actually a Nigeria own goal by Chiamaka Nnadozie.

Nigeria is by far the most successful Women’s National Team in Africa having won the continental title 11 times and appeared in every Women’s World Cup ever contested as well as three Olympic Games but recently their supremacy has been challenged as several African countries have made great strides on the field most notably South Africa Ghana and Cameroon but now by fellow World Cup qualifiers Morocco and Zambia.

Super Falcons’ head coach Randy Waldrum is also currently the head coach at the University of Pittsburgh which has gotten off to a fine start to the 2022 college season. He was also the head coach for the Houston Dash in the NWSL from 2014-2017 and for the Trinidad & Tobago Women’s National Team from 2014-2016. He got the job in May of 2020 after turning it down a few years before. Waldrum also led the University of Notre Dame to two NCAA titles during his stint in South Bend Indiana from 1999-2013 and did a short sting at the U.S. Under-23 WNT head coach.

One of Waldrum’s assistant coaches is Lauren Gregg who was one of Tony DiCicco’s two assistant coaches during the 1999 FIFA Women’s World Cup and was the interim head coach for the USWNT for three games in 2000. She was also an assistant coach for the USA at the inaugural Women’s World Cup in 1991.

Midfielder Toni Payne a native of Alabama played at Duke at represented the USA at the Youth national Team levels. In fact she was a part of the U.S. team that won the U.S. team that won the 2012 CONCACAF U-17 Women’s Championship scoring two goals with two assists in that tournament and then played in all three games at the 2012 FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup scoring against Gambia

Payne’s younger sister Nicole who attends West Virginia is also on the squad and also represented the USA at various age levels although never in a CONCACAF or FIFA tournament.

NJ/NY Gotham FC forward Ifeoma Onumonu hails from Southern California and played at UC Berkeley. She has also played for the Boston Breakers Portland Thorns and Reign FC in the NWSL. Onumonu previously played for U.S. head coach Vlatko Andonovski when they were both part of the Seattle Reign organization.

Michelle Alozie hails from Apple Valley Calif. and played college soccer at Tennessee. She plays for the Houston Dash and has played in six NWSL games so far this season and scored her second goal on Aug. 27 against the Washington Spirit to equalizer in stoppage time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1mZXN0aXZhbC1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLXRyYWRpdGlvbmFsLWZvb2QtYW5kLWRhbmNlLS82NzI4MDcxLmh0bWzSAWZodHRwczovL3d3dy52b2FuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1mZXN0aXZhbC1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLXRyYWRpdGlvbmFsLWZvb2QtYW5kLWRhbmNlLS82NzI4MDcxLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US International Festival Celebrates Traditional Food Dance,"The Washington D.C. area is multicultural with embassies international businesses and a host of ethnic restaurants.

People from Ethiopia El Salvador the Caribbean and more live in the city and the surrounding Maryland and Virginia suburbs.

To showcase the food artisans and traditional dance of these many cultures the Around the World Cultural Food Festival recently took place for the 6th year. The event is the largest outdoor cultural food festival in the Washington area.

With flags flying 40 nations were represented at a park in historic Alexandria Virginia. The event featured African countries such as Nigeria Kenya Rwanda and Ethiopia. Thailand Lebanon Jamaica and El Salvador were also included.

Corina Serbanescu the event manager said the festival provides the opportunity to learn about various cultures.

""Although the Washington area is multinational"" she said ""people don't necessarily know about one another's cultures including the food.""

Feride Ozkan owner of Istanbul Kitchen in McLean Virginia was giving visitors a taste of Turkish cuisine including chicken borek made with vegetables and mozzarella cheese and simit a Turkish bagel.

""Turkish cuisine consists of a melting pot of cultures brought together over the centuries"" she said. ""I'm serving food that I learned to cook from my mom that she learned from her mother.""

As Devin Holum from Washington took a bite of borek made with beef he said ""I had a good time going to Turkey on vacation a few years ago … and I'm enjoying the food and feeling like I'm back in the country again.""

With a long line at another booth Sus Grondin-Butler was serving Indonesian chicken satay. Considered a national dish of Indonesia satay is made from skewered and grilled marinated meat.

""What makes Indonesian food unique is that each of the islands has their own style of cuisine. Some is sweeter while other food is spicier"" she said. ""Since Indonesia has the largest Muslim population in the world there is also that influence.""

Visitors were also given a taste of cultures through traditional dance performances.

As dancers shimmied and moved their hips the Raqs El Hob dance company performed Egyptian belly dancing.

Adriane Whalen artistic director of the Washington-based troupe said ""There's the beauty of the dance and the costumes of course but I also love that it celebrates women coming together. Some of the moves today can be seen in hip hop and jazz dancing.""

Shortly after the colorfully clad Armonias Peruanas — which means Peruvian Harmony — kicked up their heels.

Lourdes Curay the troupe's director said ""We have hundreds of dances that are unique from different regions of Peru and we wanted the audience to see the richness of our country.""

Ricardo Martinez who grew up in El Salvador danced to the music.

""You can't help but get on your feet because the music and dancing are so exciting.""

Another popular performance featured Indian dancers from the Kalavaridhi Center for the Performing Arts in Herndon Virginia.

Kalavaridhi Center founder Sheela Ramanath was born in India.

""Traditional Indian dancing tells stories about right and wrong and draws a lot from Indian mythology"" she said. ""The dances are also connected to nature where every living creature is respected.""

Besides dance vendors were showing off their artistic sides.

Henna artist Kavita Dutia immigrated from India to the United States 15 years ago.

""The art of applying henna on hands and feet is a very old custom"" she explained as she painted the design of a leaf on a young woman's hand with a brown paste. ""Henna brings happiness and joy to life.""

""I thought it would be fun to do this"" said Cara Shawly a college student. ""It's pretty and like getting a tattoo but one you know won't last forever.""

Items from around the world were being sold at the festival.

Monica Mensah from Ghana was selling traditional clothing and baskets. Her business is called Back to the Roots.

""I am here to showcase Ghana"" she said. ""I want everyone to know that Ghana has a beautiful culture with peaceful friendly and welcoming people.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDMvd29ybGQvYW1lcmljYXMvc2hpcHMtZ3BzLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtbGF3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Shady Ships Use GPS to Evade International Law,"The scrappy oil tanker waited to load fuel at a dilapidated jetty projecting from a giant Venezuelan refinery on a December morning.

The fate of 13 former American colonies was agreed upon and the borders of the new republic were agreed upon: Florida north to the Great Lakes and the Atlantic coast west to the Mississippi River.

The events leading up to the treaty extended to April 1775 in a common green area in Lexington Massachusetts when the American colonists responded to King George III's refusal to grant them political and economic reform by armed revolution according to History.

On July 4 1776 more than a year after the start of the war the Second Continental Congress formally adopted the Declaration of Independence. After five difficult years in October 1781 British General Charles Lord Cornwallis surrendered to American and French forces at Yorktown Virginia ending the last major battle of the Revolution.

In September 1782 Benjamin Franklin along with John Adams and John Jay began formal peace negotiations with the British. The Continental Congress originally appointed a five-person panel including Franklin Adams and Jay along with Thomas Jefferson and Henry Lorenz to conduct the talks. However both Jefferson and Lawrence missed the sessions.

Jefferson was late to travel and Laurens was captured by the British and kept in the Tower of London. The American delegation distrusting the French chose to negotiate separately with the British.

During the talks Franklin demanded that Britain hand over Canada to the United States. This did not happen but America gained enough new territory south of the Canadian border to double its size. The United States has also successfully negotiated important fishing rights in Canadian waters.

Two months later the main details have been worked out. On November 30 1782 the United States and Britain signed the preliminary articles of the treaty. France signed its initial peace treaty with Britain on January 20 1783. Then in September of that year the final treaty was signed by the three countries and Spain. The Continental Congress ratified the Treaty of Paris on January 14 1784.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlemVlbi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wMy9zdXBlcnRhbGwtc2t5c2NyYXBlcnMtYmVpbmctYnVpbHQtYXJvdW5kLXRoZS13b3JsZC1yb3VuZHVwcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fifteen supertall skyscrapers being built around the world,"To mark World Skyscraper Day Dezeen has rounded up 15 supertall skyscrapers that are set to be built in cities across the globe including a pair of twisting towers in Australia and the buildings battling to become Africa's tallest.

For some an inspiring beacon of progress and for others emblematic of economic inequalities neck-craning skyscrapers continue to capture the public imagination.

The vast majority of tall buildings have been constructed in the past two decades and this trend shows no sign of slowing down as cities around the world build ever higher.

Supertall skyscrapers which are buildings over 300 metres tall are increasingly appearing in our cities. Dezeen recently highlighted 11 supertall skyscrapers that have had a major impact in the past 10 years and looked at six supertalls set to join the skylines of North American cities.

Below are 15 skyscrapers being built around the world each in a different city:

Special to USA TODAY

Forget scrolling through your phone’s endless photo gallery to find something. Here’s a pro trick to locate any photo you want in 30 seconds or less.

If your photos aren’t backed up this is your friendly reminder to do it now. You’d be heartbroken should you lose all those memories. Tap or click for the foolproof steps to make the job a lot easier.

When it comes to the old photos you have lying around you don’t need to pay for an expensive digitizing service or buy a scanner. You can use an app to get the job done. Here are three great options:

PhotoScan by Google Photos

Google’s PhotoScan is a free app for iOS and Android that scans your photos multiple times then stitches all the images together to remove glare and improve the quality of the final image. The app works on matte gloss prints and photos inside or outside albums.

Tech how-to:Colorize old black-and-white family photos

Here’s how it works: Snap one photo then take four additional shots according to the app’s instructions. PhotoScan uses an algorithm to detect and crop the photo automatically detect the edge correct the rotation and correct the perspective to show a frontal view.

• Open the PhotoScan app and hold your phone above a photo.

• Tap the capture button to take pictures which will save to your device.

• Move your phone around to get the circle over each of the four dots.

• After the photo is processed tap the photo thumbnail.

• Select a photo to rotate adjust the corners or delete.

You can then use Google Photos to store and organize your scans. From there you can edit your images and share them with others.

Microsoft Lens

Microsoft Lens (formerly Office Lens) is a free business-oriented scanning app that works with documents whiteboards business cards receipts menus signs handwritten memos or anything else containing text you want to import to your phone. It certainly beats typing everything by hand.

The app also works with photos and automatically corrects things like shadows and odd angles.

Microsoft Lens makes it easy to digitize photos in a few steps:

• Open Microsoft Lens and swipe left or right near the bottom of the screen and select Photo.

• Point your camera at the photo you want to capture ensuring it is in the frame. You can turn the flash on and off before tapping the camera button to snap the picture.

• Now you can Add a new image to your scan apply a Filter to the image Crop Rotate or Delete the image. You can also annotate it or add text.

• Tap Done when you’re finished.

You can save pictures in your phone’s gallery.

A solid option for negatives: FilmBox by Photomyne

FilmBox is a scanner app for iOS and Android that digitizes your camera film negatives using just your smartphone.

You can view capture and save film negatives making browsing organizing and sharing easier. FilmBox inverts the image’s negative colors into positive then enhances the overall appearance.

Note: The first few scans are free but you’ll have to pay for a subscription if you want to capture more. A two-year plan costs $39.99 and gives unlimited access to the app and its features.

All you need is a light source and your smartphone to get started:

• Place your negatives in a dark or low-lit room. Open the FilmBox app.

• The only light source should be a backlight which you can get by opening a white screen on a tablet or computer. You can also use the photomyne.com/backlight link provided in the app. Set your backlight device to the highest brightness setting.

• Hold your film strip vertically in front of the light and keep it steady. Make sure the perforated borders are included in the scanning screen.

• Hold your negatives about two inches away from the light source and tap the app’s capture button.

• Your image will be saved as a digital photo in the app.

“When I transplant seedlings they die out. The salt is still in the soil” said the farmer from Slab Ta Aon village a riverside settlement roughly 150 kilometers southwest of Cambodia’s capital Phnom Penh and 4 kilometers from the green mangrove-lined coast of Kampot province.

The farmer said that saltwater has destroyed rice paddies in Slab Ta Aon village for the past two years. Prak Nhorn 55 doubts that he and the other villagers will be able grow rice in the future.

Slab Ta Aon’s problem is no environmental fluke. It is an omen of a global environmental crisis that has been brewing for decades destabilizing food systems that feed millions.

Around the world saltwater is seeping further and further inland from the coasts tainting soils and fresh water with salt. A complicated interplay between groundwater extraction river damming for hydropower and riverbed mining is sinking shorelines as climate change raises the seas drawing seawater inland.

River deltas are especially vulnerable. Fan-shaped plains that form where rivers spill into the sea deltas often boast fertile soils thanks to nutrient-rich sediments delivered from upstream. Increasing salinity puts these special agricultural regions at risk.

The threat is perhaps most grave in Asia where vast “megadeltas” are vital for growing the continent’s staple crop — rice. High salinity can make it impossible to grow rice.

“You really see a solid layer … a white layer on the soil from where saltwater was” said Bjoern Ole Sander of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). Rice plants growing in saline soil “look like straw” he continued. “If you touch them they’re hollow. There’s nothing.”

Food drinking water at risk

In Southeast Asia saltwater threatens rice paddies in the Mekong River and Red River deltas in Vietnam and the deltas of the Chao Phraya River in Thailand and the Ayeyarwady River in Myanmar.

In South Asia it degrades soils and taints drinking water in the densely populated Ganges–Brahmaputra Delta of Bangladesh and India and the Indus Delta of Pakistan.

China’s Yangtze River Delta also faces rising salinity.

Beyond Asia saltwater intrusion affects the Nile Delta in Egypt and the Mississippi Delta in the United States — both important agricultural regions.

For subsistence farmers like Prak Nhorn rising salinity directly threatens food security and access to drinking water. About 76% of Cambodians live in rural areas and many depend on natural resources for food. This makes many of the country’s 17.2 million inhabitants vulnerable to changes in the environment. Undernutrition rates in Cambodia hover around 15%.

Cambodian farmers have reported issues with salinity for years and “there is saltwater intrusion” in the country said Hak Mao director of Cambodia’s Climate Change Department at the Ministry of Environment. But “limited technical capacity” means the true extent of the problem in Cambodia is not known he said.

In neighboring Vietnam however the costs of saltwater intrusion have been clear for decades.

“If there’s fresh water we can grow rice all year round” said farmer Khau Van Ngoan of Vietnam’s Long An province. “If there’s none nothing can be grown.”

Vietnam grows more than half of its rice in one region — the Mekong River Delta.

There salinity has “really been on the rise” said hydrologist Gijs Simons of FutureWater a consultancy that uses satellite data to assess salinity for the Mekong River Commission (MCR). The area affected by severe salinity which makes it nearly impossible to grow rice has roughly “doubled since the '90s or even almost tripled for some years” he said.

In the past saltwater would seep about 30-50 kilometers inland. Now it can reach areas more than 100 kilometers inward from the coast said hydrologist Binh Doan Van of the Vietnamese-German University who studies saltwater intrusions in the Mekong River Delta. One particularly severe salinity intrusion in 2016 affected 270000 hectares of rice said Andrew Wyatt who oversees projects in Southeast Asia for the environmental organization International Union for Conservation of Nature or IUCN. The damage totaled an estimated $455 million or 1.5% percent of Vietnam’s annual rice yield.

Shrimp alternative

But it’s possible to see rising salinity as an opportunity rather than a disaster.

Rice can’t tolerate salty water but shrimp can — and shrimp fetch a better price than the rice Vietnam produces for export to low- and middle-income countries.

“Shrimp is better business than rice. It’s more lucrative” said Dang Thi Vich a shrimp farmer from Ben Tre province.

Some farmers in the Mekong River Delta took advantage of this as salinity rose growing shrimp instead of rice during the dry season when conditions are most saline. The Vietnamese government and NGOs later launched programs to help more farmers adopt this rice-shrimp rotation system.

“Shrimp farming began about some 20 years ago and it’s become very popular” said Vich. “Everyone grew rice before that.”

Things are changing fast. In 2018 15% of farmers in the delta gave up rice farming for something else usually shrimp farming said Bradford Mills an economist at Virginia Tech who studied the switch. The next year another 10% stopped growing rice. Simons noted that the shift from rice paddies to shrimp ponds is visible in his satellite data.

Experts say the Vietnamese government plans to scale back rice farming and diversify the Mekong River Delta’s economy. This will mean upping shrimp and other aquaculture along the coast and growing “high quality” rice for export to rich countries. This diversification “is in line with Vietnam's move from a low-income country to a middle-low-income country” said Wyatt.

But researchers have expressed concerns that adaptions to rising salinity in Vietnam are coming at a social cost widening the gap between rich and poor.

“For the country scale [shrimp farming] may be good” said Binh. “But for [the] local scale for individuals that's I think [it] still has some problems.”

Ben Tre province farmer Nguyen Thi Be Lieu said she tried shrimp farming a couple of years ago “but business didn’t take off. We spent more than we earned so we stopped.”

Switching from rice to shrimp aquaculture is risky. Not everyone can afford to. Those who can’t — and who don’t receive aid — can have no choice but to sell or lease their land and migrate to find work.

There’s also evidence that shrimp aquaculture isn’t always environmentally sustainable. While Wyatt noted that rice-shrimp rotation is more sustainable than farming rice or shrimp exclusively for lands at the mouth of the Mekong it isn’t a good solution everywhere it is being adopted. If there’s not enough freshwater flow from upstream dry-season shrimp ponds can leave salt in the soil which over time makes it hard to grow rice at all in the wet season. Ponds can get so salty that even shrimp can’t survive.

“Saline soil is bad for business even shrimp farming” said Long An province farmer Pham Van Bay. “There’s absolutely nothing you can do with saline soil.”

Aquaculture can also pollute waterways a problem Binh says should be managed to ensure that it stays sustainable and profitable for the future.

Still if these challenges can be overcome sating wealthy countries’ appetites for shrimp and high-quality rice could pay off for many farmers and the Vietnamese economy as a whole said Binh and Wyatt.

‘How can we have rice to eat?’

The question said Sander “is of course: where do you produce the rice instead? Because demand is still there. And shrimp cannot replace rice on people's plates.”

Vietnam is the third-biggest rice exporter worldwide and more than 90% of its exports come from the Mekong River Delta. Countries that are “big rice importers … are hit also by climate change impacts and salinity impacts in the Mekong Delta” said Sander. For instance the Philippines imports nearly 80% of its rice from Vietnam.

Demand for rice is increasing as the world population grows. IRRI estimates that rice production globally needs to increase by 1% to 1.2% every year to keep rice prices low enough to be affordable for billions of people who depend on the grain.

For the Mekong River Delta Binh said that adapting to rising salinity involves a combination of pricey infrastructure to keep saltwater out — which can come with its own environmental problems — and changes to how people live and work like adopting rice-shrimp systems. Other agricultural deltas face similar choices.

Countries that import a lot of rice from salinity-affected regions will need to find new sources to meet their growing demand for rice or consumers will simply pay more for it. Many farmers will need to adapt. And some will just need to find a way to survive.

Suos Sovann lives just a stone’s throw away from Prak Nhorn’s farm in Slab Ta Aon village. She is a rice farmer — or was. Saltwater now floods her 7000-square-meter farm every year making her soil infertile.

Unable to grow rice for herself and her family Suos Sovann now depends on money sent by two of her children who work in a nearby garment factory. Combined they send her about $50 every month. She will spend $30 of it on rice.

She wonders if perhaps her children could send more money but she doesn’t dare ask. There’s nothing to do but bear with it she says.

""If we don’t farm"" asked Suos Sovann ""how can we have rice to eat?”

INJURY PRONE Phil Jones has been kicked out of Manchester United’s training ground dressing room - to make space for Erik ten Hag’s new signings.

The first team changing room at United’s AON training Centre at Carrington is only meant for a maximum 24 players and is bursting to capacity after Ten Hag’s summer spending spree.

And that’s left stars like Jones and third choice left back Brandon Williams on loan at Norwich last season being shunted down the corridor to the Under-23 changing room.

Joining them are believed to be defenders Teden Mengi and Axel Tuanzebe as well as promising midfielder Shola Shoretire.

The arrival of Real Madrid’s Brazilian midfielder Casemiro Ajax winger Antony Argentinian defender Lisandro Martinez left back Tyrell Malacia and back-up keeper Martin Dubravka has squeezed space at Carrington.

It’s the latest blow for hapless Jones and another twist in his bizarre United career that had hit the buffers even before he signed a four-year £110000-week contract in February 2019.

The 30-year-old former England defender has played only 13 games in four seasons and his last appearance came in January in a 1-0 defeat by Wolves - his first match in two years.

United fans are astonished the former Blackburn defender is even still at Old Trafford after the transfer window closed on Thursday.

But it’s believed Jones in the final year of his contract is nursing another injury and was unable to be sold in the latest window.

United have given up on recovering a fee for the defender who was once described by Sir Bobby Charlton as reminding him of the great Duncan Edwards.

Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag has reportedly axed Phil Jones and four other players from the club's first-team dressing room in order to accommodate new signings.

Although United endured a slow start to the transfer window Dutchman Ten Hag was backed with significant funds in a bid to overhaul a squad that slumped to United's worst-ever finish in the Premier League last term.

Tyrell Malacia Christian Eriksen Lisandro Martinez Casemiro Antony and Martin Dubravka have all arrived at Old Trafford over the summer for a combined sum of around £220million - the largest amount Manchester United have ever spent in a single transfer window.

The influx of new arrivals has left United's first-team dressing room at their Carrington base at breaking point. And according to The Sun the AON Training Centre's first-team changing room is only able to accommodate a maximum of 24 players... meaning the club have been forced to a shunt a number of fringe players into the U23's changing area.

Jones is the biggest name to have been culled by Ten Hag in order to make room for the club's new recruits the England international still at Old Trafford despite seeing his career wrecked by injury.

Brandon Williams who spent last year on loan at Norwich City has also been sacrificed. Defenders Axel Tuanzebe and Tegen Mendi are two other players to have been moved along with young midfielder Shola Shoretire.

Join the debate! What did you make of Man Utd's summer transfer business? Let us know here.

Ten Hag's decision is the latest blow for Jones who was expected to leave this summer. Williams and Tuanzebe were also available for transfer in the window however Ten Hag was reluctant to lose the trio in the wake of injuries which scuppered their chances of securing moves.

Jones has only made a handful of senior appearances after being plagued by injuries over the past four years. His last match for United was in the 1-0 defeat against Wolves back in January - his first appearance in two years.

Williams is unlikely to be handed a reprieve anytime soon following the positive impression that Malacia has made to life at Old Trafford while Tuanzebe and Jones have dropped even further down the pecking order after the arrival of Martinez who has struck up an instant understanding with Raphael Varane.

Malacia and Martinez have already taken the places of Luke Shaw and Haryr Maguire in Ten Hag's first-choice XI and both are set to start against Arsenal on Sunday with Eriksen expected to continue in midfield. Big money Brazilian duo Casemiro and Antony are both yet to make their first starts for the club with the £85million Ajax star having only joined this week.",,,,,,

Reportedly several old iphones could be killed off. However Apple has not made any official announcement in regards to the discontinuation of the previous iPhone models.

According to the reports Apple may ditch the older iPhones especially iPhone 11 after the iPhone 14 launch. The American tech giant tends to follow this norm to ensure sales of new models are not affected.

Here is a list of iPhone models whose existence has been put in doubt ahead of the launch of iPhone 14.

iPhone 11

As per the reports from iDropNews Apply may drop the iPhone 11 as it takes the sale of new iPhone SE 3 away. Additionally iPhone 11 does not support 5G. The claim has been echoed by a Tom’s guide report that says “Apply also rarely keeps phones longer than three years after their release date. The iPhone 11 unveiled in September 2019 is rapidly approaching its Sell-By date so it is a pretty safe bet that it is getting cycled out of the lineup this fall.""

iPhone 12 mini

Apple is believed to avoid the iPhone 14 mini in favour of the new large iPhone 14 Max or Plus as the mini version previously failed to deliver as per the company’s expectations on terms of sales. While keeping it in mind Apple may discontinue the iPhone 12 mini too.

iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max

While analysing the earlier patterns of Apple it is assumed that the tech giant may kill off the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max. Significantly since the beginning of the Pro and Pro Max models back in 2019 Apple has never kept any of its Pro versions for more than a year. Additionally the latest iPhone 14 is expected to get the same iphone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max’s chipset.

Meanwhile as the much-awaited Apple launch event is likely to take place soon several rumours about the upcoming iPhone 14 line-up phones have been making rounds and the latest one suggests that Pro models will revive the classic iOS battery percentage indicator.

Apple could train you. The company offers two professional training and certification programs to better prepare people for a career in IT. The courses focus on how to deploy manage and support various Apple devices in the workplace. You can sign up for the courses here.

The courses are called Apple Device Support and Apple Deployment and Management. Both use a combination of articles and exercises and they are sequential.

The Apple Device Support course is a mix of articles and exercises that cover tools and services -- like troubleshooting and system administration -- used to support Apple device users. The company said the course covers about 14 hours of content. Once it's completed you'll take an exam to earn certification and to advance to the next course.

The Apple Deployment and Management course will show you how to configure manage and secure Apple products using mobile device management. This course also covers how to develop your own deployment strategy and how to use Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager. Apple estimates there is about 13 hours of content in this course. Once the course is complete you can take the certification exam.

Each exam costs $149 and recertification exams for unexpired certificates cost $49. Apple said it will offer scholarships covering the cost of the exams to students in its Community Education Initiative. Anyone with financial difficulties can also apply for vouchers from the Mac Admins Foundation to help pay for the cost of the exams.

People who pass the certification exams receive a digital certificate that can be displayed on resumes online profiles and job boards. Apple

""Apple Professional Training helps anyone with an interest in technology ... pursue high-paying IT jobs with certifications that will stand out to potential employers"" Susan Prescott Apple's vice president of enterprise and education marketing said in a release. ""The new courses are self-paced and freely available and we are working to ensure ability to pay isn't a barrier to earning Apple certification.""

Apple is also offering in-person preparatory courses at community colleges and universities. A version of these courses was offered at Austin Community College in Texas in 2020. Maricopa Community Colleges in Chandler and Mesa Arizona and Ed Farm an education nonprofit based in Birmingham Alabama will offer the courses soon.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics found the number of jobs in the computer and information technology field is expected to grow by 13% by 2030 and there are about 42400 openings in this field each year. The median yearly wage for these careers is about $97430 which is much higher than the median yearly wage for all other jobs at $45760."

The endoscope is an imaging device consisting of a camera and a light guide attached to a long flexible tube. It is particularly useful for acquiring images of the inside of a human body. For example stomach and colon endoscopy are widely used for the early detection and diagnosis of diseases such as ulcers and cancers.

In general an endoscope is manufactured by attaching a camera sensor to the end of a probe or using an optical fiber which allows for information to be transmitted using light. In the case of an endoscope that uses a camera sensor the thickness of the probe increases which makes the endoscopy rather invasive. In the case of an endoscope using an optical fiber bundle it can be manufactured in a thinner form factor which minimizes invasiveness and results in much less discomfort to the patients.

However the downside is that in a conventional fiber-bundle endoscope it is difficult to perform high-resolution imaging because the resolution of the obtained image is limited by the size of the individual fiber cores. Much of the image information is also lost due to reflection from the probe tip. Furthermore in fiber endoscopy it is often necessary to label the target with fluorescence especially in biological samples with low reflectivity due to strong back-reflection noise generated from the tip of the thin probe.

Recently a research team led by CHOI Wonshik the Associate Director of the Center for Molecular Spectroscopy and Dynamics (CMSD) within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) has developed a high-resolution holographic endoscope system. The researchers were able to overcome the previous limitation of fiber optic endoscopy and were able to reconstruct high-resolution images without attaching a lens or any equipment to the distal end of the fiber bundle.

This feat was accomplished by measuring the holographic images of the light waves that are reflected from the object and captured by the fiber bundle. The researchers first illuminated an object by focusing light onto a single core of a fiber bundle and measured holographic images that were reflected from the object at a certain distance from the optical fiber. In the process of analyzing the holographic images it was possible to reconstruct the object image with a microscopic resolution by correcting the phase retardation that occurs by each fiber core. Specifically a unique coherent image optimization algorithm was developed to eliminate fiber-induced phase retardations in both the illumination and detection pathways and reconstruct an object image with a microscopic resolution.

Since the developed endoscope does not attach any equipment to the end of the optical fiber the diameter of the endoscope probe is 350 μm which is thinner than the needle used for hypodermic injection. Using this approach researchers were able to obtain high-resolution images with a spatial resolution of 850 nm which is far smaller than the core size of the optical fiber bundle.

The researchers went on to test the new Fourier holographic endoscopy system to image the villi structure of mice. It was possible to acquire high contrast image by effectively removing the back-reflection noise of the probe even in biological samples with very low reflectivity such as rat villi. In addition post-processing of the measured holographic information made it possible to reconstruct multi-depth 3D images from a single data set with a depth resolution of 14 μm.

It is believed that the practical application of this new endoscope will greatly improve the way we can image the internal structures of our body in a minimally invasive manner with little to no discomfort for patients. It will also open the possibility of directly observing cavities as small as microvessels and the smallest airways in the lungs which was impossible with preexisting technologies. The researchers even suggested the application of their new endoscope can go well beyond the medical field as it can potentially be useful for industrial inspections of semiconductors and microprocessors.

n maillon grippe et toute la chaîne peut défaillir voire dérailler. Dans celle des soins les sociétés d’ambulances privées sont l’un de ces maillons assurant une jonction essentielle. À partir du 1er octobre elles tiendront un rôle encore élargi dans le dispositif même de transport des urgences pré-hospitalières. Le transport sanitaire privé était déjà tenu d’assurer 12 heures de garde la nuit. À compter du 1er octobre dans chacun des neuf secteurs découpant la Charente-Maritime un équipage de deux ambulanciers devra être en mesure de répondre aux sollicitations du centre 15 la régulation médicale d’urgence « H24 ».

Sur le même sujet Gironde : le centre 15 en souffrance face au défi de la régulation des urgences Depuis le mois de mai dernier la direction du CHU de Bordeaux a régulé ses urgences adultes mesure dupliquée par toutes les urgences de la Gironde. En début de ligne le Centre 15 s’essouffle

Pas une question d’argent

Le hic c’est que l’entrée en vigueur de ces gardes élargies survient en Charente-Maritime en tout cas plusieurs années après la conclusion de l’accord. Entretemps bien des paramètres ont changé. Le coût des carburants a bondi notamment. « La compensation d’une garde de 12 heures pour la mobilisation d’un équipage de deux personnes était de 346 euros. En passant sur un système de garde H24 l’heure sera rétribuée 64 euros ce qui couvre à peine les frais » analyse Bernard Fauconnet longtemps président de l’association des transports sanitaires urgents en Charente-Maritime avant d’en confier les clés à son homologue rochelaise Magalie Gerbaut.

Ne pas y lire une remise en question de l’accord accepté avec l’État. « Il a fallu aux entreprises privées de transport sanitaire du département trouver les modèles d’organisation jongler de manière serrée mais toutes les entreprises vont remplir cette mission sans se préoccuper d’équilibre financier » promet Bernard Fauconnet de tout temps investi dans la défense de sa corporation jusqu’à exercer un temps la vice-présidence du syndicat national.

Effectifs en berne

L’inquiétude actuelle des professionnels tient davantage à la bonne compréhension de leurs difficultés par leurs clients. Certes pour ces derniers le service rendu est financièrement indolore en surface puisque pris en charge par l’Assurance-maladie. « Mais certains regrettent parfois par exemple de ne pas bénéficier d’un transport individuel pour être conduit à un rendez-vous médical. Précisons déjà que le transport groupé assis est autorisé mais surtout pour nous professionnels c’est parfois une nécessité pour pouvoir répondre à la demande. »

« Notre profession a enregistré des démissions et rencontre des difficultés de recrutement »

Un autre paramètre a sensiblement évolué depuis qu’État et ambulanciers privés ont convenu d’une garde sur la journée entière. « La crise Covid est passée par là et notre profession comme bien d’autres a enregistré des démissions et rencontre des difficultés de recrutement. » Bernard Fauconnet illustre son propos par le cas de l’entreprise qu’il a lui-même créé à Cozes près de Royan en 1980 dont son fils assure aujourd’hui la direction. « Avec un effectif de 50 salariés dont une trentaine de roulants on peut rapidement se retrouver avec une dizaine d’absents. » Le problème peut vite devenir aigu avec le doublement des gardes pour les urgences pré-hospitalières à partir du 1er octobre.

Ne pas voir que les contraintes

Le site de Pôle emploi fait état de 245 offres de postes d’ambulancier (ères) s et d’auxiliaires ambulancier (ère) s ou propositions de contrat d’apprentissage. « Et on reçoit peu voire pas de réponses » se désole Bernard Fauconnet. « À croire que les gens ne veulent plus s’engager. Ce métier est pourtant porteur de valeurs humaines. Je comprends que la question du salaire soit importante mais déjà nos ressources étant encadrées par les remboursements de l’Assurance-maladie les marges sont extrêmement serrées nous ne pouvons pas augmenter substantiellement les salaires. Mais peut-être faut-il arrêter de ne considérer un métier que sous l’angle des contraintes. Il faut peut-être voir aussi l’importance du rôle qu’on joue dans le parcours de soins d’un patient l’accompagnement qu’on lui apporte à notre niveau la relation humaine qu’on noue avec lui » tente de plaider Bernard Fauconnet.

La conséquence de ces effectifs sur le fil ? « On refuse quotidiennement des missions de transport assis. Mon souci c’est de faire entendre aux clients cette réalité. Nous ne le faisons pas pour une raison économique mais parce que la profession manque de personnel. Avec des salariés en nombre suffisant nous pourrions mieux gérer l’emploi de nos véhicules. Bon si les heures de sortie dans les établissements de soins étaient aussi mieux respectées si les rendez-vous étaient assurés à l’heure également… » Un autre débat bien qu’il participe d’une grande planification plus harmonieuse en constante amélioration nuance Bernard Fauconnet. Les mois et années n’en seront pas plus faciles à aborder pour ce maillon de plus en plus important que représente le transport sanitaire privé.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZm10di5jb20vaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9sLXVrcmFpbmUtcmVjb25uYWl0LWF2b2lyLWZyYXBwZS11bmUtYmFzZS1ydXNzZS1wcmVzLWRlLWxhLWNlbnRyYWxlLWRlLXphcG9yaWppYV9BRC0yMDIyMDkwMzAwNzUuaHRtbNIBjQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZm10di5jb20vYW1wL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvbC11a3JhaW5lLXJlY29ubmFpdC1hdm9pci1mcmFwcGUtdW5lLWJhc2UtcnVzc2UtcHJlcy1kZS1sYS1jZW50cmFsZS1kZS16YXBvcmlqaWFfQUQtMjAyMjA5MDMwMDc1Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,L'Ukraine reconnaît avoir frappé une base russe près de la centrale de Zaporijia,"Vendredi livrant le bilan quotidien de ses opérations l'armée ukrainienne a indiqué avoir frappé la base russe d'Energodar près de Zaporijia assurant y avoir détruit trois systèmes d'artillerie un dépôt de munitions mais aussi avoir tué des soldats.

L'Ukraine a indiqué vendredi avoir frappé une base russe à Energodar dans le sud du pays non loin de la centrale nucléaire de Zaporijia d'où elle accuse la Russie d'avoir retiré ses armements avant son inspection par une équipe de l'Agence internationale de l'énergie atomique (AIEA).

L'Ukraine dresse le bilan de ses frappes sur Energodar

Dans le même temps alors que les pays du G7 visaient la manne énergétique de la Russie en convenant de plafonner le prix de son pétrole Moscou a fait trembler les Européens en annonçant que le gazoduc Nord Stream serait totalement arrêté jusqu'à la réparation d'une turbine un motif jugé fallacieux par l'Allemagne hautement dépendante du gaz russe.

""Dans les localités de Kherson et d'Energodar des frappes précises de nos troupes ont détruit trois systèmes d'artillerie de l'ennemi ainsi qu'un dépôt de munitions"" tuant nombre de militaires russes a affirmé l'armée ukrainienne dans son point d'information quotidien.

Accusations mutuelles

L'armée ukrainienne a par ailleurs affirmé que les forces russes avaient évacué ""tout leur équipement militaire depuis le site de la centrale"" avant l'arrivée jeudi de la mission de l'AIEA dont plusieurs membres sont restées à la centrale et s'y trouvent toujours. La centrale de Zaporijia la plus grande d'Europe est tombée aux mains des troupes russes en mars peu après le lancement par Moscou de son invasion de l'Ukraine et son site a été visé par plusieurs bombardements faisant craindre une catastrophe nucléaire. Kiev et Moscou se rejettent la responsabilité de ces frappes.

Arnaque. Cotation en direct et historique des transactions : on se croirait à la Bourse de Paris sur le site du revendeur de sneakers StockX. Depuis quelques années les baskets sont devenues un véritable objet de spéculation. Certains modèles s'échangent à prix d'or à l'instar de la vente record au printemps 2021 d'une paire de Nike Air Yeezy 1 portée par le rappeur Kanye West pour la modique somme de 18 million de dollars. Un marché fructueux qui a donné la folie des grandeurs à Michael Malekzadeh rattrapé en août par la justice américaine.

Déjà surnommé « le Madoff de la sneaker » ce natif de l'Oregon aurait monté une pyramide de Ponzi au travers de son site Zadeh Kicks. Selon les procureurs fédéraux il collectait l'argent de ses clients en leur assurant qu'il leur fournirait moyennant un paiement à l'avance des paires de sneakers rares dans un délai de trois à six mois après leurs sorties d'usines. L'escroc présumé achetait en réalité les modèles sur des sites de revente classique dans des quantités bien inférieures à celles promises. Les heureux élus qui recevaient leurs commandes les revendaient en réalisant une plus-value et ceux privés de marchandises étaient remboursés en cartes cadeaux grâce à l'argent des nouveaux clients.

Le système s'est effondré au coup de trop : Malekzadeh avait enregistré 600.000 commandes d'une paire d'Air Jordan en édition limitée mais ne possédait que 1 % du stock. Les défauts de paiement s'accumulant l'homme de 39 ans a été contraint de se déclarer insolvable. Il a été inculpé de trois chefs d'accusation recouvrant une escroquerie de 85 millions de dollars : 70 millions pour les pertes des particuliers et 15 millions pour celles des institutions financières auprès desquelles il est endetté. Une somme de 64 millions de dollars a déjà été récoltée par la justice américaine grâce à la vente d'une partie de ses effets personnels et près de 60.000 paires de sneakers saisies ont été mises sur le marché.

ATF agents were back on the scene of the fire on Harvey Road near Post Oak Mall on Tuesday looking at evidence along with investigators from the College Station Fire Department and the State Fire Marshal’s Office.

KBTX has learned accelerants were detected at the scene of the fire along with racist spray-painted messages in three separate spots on the property including on the outside of the building a utility box and a fence.

A spokesman for the College Station Fire Department said that because it’s an ongoing investigation he could not comment on specifics but confirmed that the ATF reached out Monday to assist in investigating the blaze.

“We begin treating all fire scenes like this with the assumption that it may be an arson” said CSFD Captain Stuart Marrs.

We have reached out to the ATF for additional comment on the investigation.

A spokesman for the FBI Houston Office declined to say if agents are also involved in the case.

On Monday the fire was first reported around 2 a.m. by an employee at a nearby business who heard an explosion and saw the fire at Krispy Kreme.

“When our crews arrived the structure was already compromised. Flames were intense and parts of the building were collapsing so CSFD fought the fire from the outside using large bore nozzles and aerial ladders” said Cpt. Marrs. “At about 2:30 we called for additional resources and a second fire hydrant for more water supply.”

No employees were at work when the fire started and no injuries were reported.

Volunteers from Brazos County Fire Departments staffed CSFD’s Stations 1 and 3 to protect the rest of the city for the rest of the morning as fire crews worked to contain the fire.

Georgia’s president has called on protesters to use their vote in upcoming parliamentary elections to ""reverse"" the controversial foreign agents law passed by the country’s parliament on Tuesday.

President Salome Zourabichvili admitted to CNN's Christiane Amanpour that there are ""many concerns"" after the parliament voted in favor of the controversial foreign agents law.

""The way and the place where we can reverse all of this is the elections in October...And we have to use this mobilization of the society and this consolidation of the political parties to go and win those elections"" Zourabichvili said.

The president who has previously accused Russia of trying to bolster its influence over the former Soviet country told CNN that she will symbolically veto the law.

Due to the setup of Georgia's parliamentary system Zourabichvili holds mainly a figurehead role and her veto can be overruled by a simple parliamentary majority.

She called the law a complete ""duplicate"" of one passed by the Kremlin in 2012 which she said has been used to ""completely oppress and repress the civil society"" in Russia.

Russia is growing more and ""more worried"" by Georgia's rapprochement with the European Union Zourabichvili remarked referencing the recent decision by the bloc to grant Georgia candidate status.

Although roughly 20% of Georgian territory is currently controlled by Russia following the 2008 invasion Georgia has not been ""diverted"" from ""following its European path"" the president added.

It was a remarkable moment in modern American politics: The House speaker turning his Republican Party against the federal and state legal systems that are foundational to the U.S. government and a cornerstone of democracy.

Johnson who is second in line for the presidency called the court system “corrupt.”

Outside the New York courthouse he decried “this ridiculous prosecution that is not about justice.” He said “It’s all about politics.”

AP AUDIO: Speaker Mike Johnson’s appearance at Trump’s felony trial marks a remarkable moment in US politics AP correspondent Julie Walker reports House Speaker Mike Johnson lends his support to Donald Trump at court today.

The speaker is leading a growing list of Republican lawmakers who are criticizing the American judicial system as they rally to Trump’s side appearing at the courthouse to defend the party’s presumptive presidential nominee. Trump is accused of having arranged secret payments to a porn actress to hide negative stories during his successful 2016 campaign for president.

With Trump stuck in court and barred by a judge’s gag order from criticizing witnesses or certain elements of the case Johnson and the lawmakers are taking it upon themselves to attack the proceedings now in a fourth week of witness testimony. They’re using the trial as a de facto campaign stop as they work to return the former president to the White House.

In portraying the case against Trump as politically motivated the Republicans are also laying the groundwork to dismiss its significance should the jury convict and for potential challenges to the fall election a rematch with President Joe Biden a Democrat.

Johnson was a chief architect of Trump’s efforts to challenge the 2020 presidential results ahead of the Jan. 6 2021 mob assault on the U.S. Capitol and last week he called the hush money trial and the other election-year cases against Trump a “borderline criminal conspiracy.”

“It is election interference” Johnson said Tuesday insisting he was appearing on his own to support a friend. “And the American people are not going to let this stand.”

Unlike other Republicans showing up to show their support Johnson did not enter the courtroom where Trump is on trial departing the scene following his remarks to reporters as he dashed back to Washington to open the House chamber for the day.

Also with Trump on Tuesday were U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum — both considered possible vice presidential candidates — as well as former GOP candidate Vivek Ramaswamy one of Trump’s current top surrogates.

U.S. Sens. JD Vance of Ohio and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama were among those who attended court on Monday.

Trump’s campaign has lined up allies in recent days to appear at the New York courthouse to attack witnesses and others whom Trump is barred by a judge’s gag order from criticizing himself.

Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said Monday that he appeared last week at the invitation of Trump senior advisor Susie Wiles. The campaign has said others volunteered to come to New York.

“The Democrats are using the court system to go after and prosecute criminally a political opponent — that’s a crime” Scott said over the weekend on Fox News. “They’re just thugs trying to stop Trump from being able to run for president.”

In the short term the Republicans’ presence at the courthouse and comments critical of the process have let Trump and his allies amplify their message without risking another explicit violation of the gag order. Trump’s attorneys have challenged the gag order as unconstitutional but an appeals court upheld it on Tuesday.

Johnson specifically attacked the credibility of Michael Cohen Trump’s former lawyer and fixer who began his second day of testimony in the former president’s hush money trial. And others too.

He criticized Cohen as “a man who is clearly on a mission for personal revenge” said lead prosecutor Matthew Colangelo “recently received over $10000 in payments from the Democratic National Committee” and said the daughter of Judge Juan M. Merchan has made “millions of dollars” doing online fundraising for Democrats.

Colangelo who joined the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office in 2022 and previously worked in the U.S. Justice Department in the Biden administration did paid “political consulting” work for the DNC in 2018 according to federal campaign finance records.

The Republican speaker who is wholly dependent on support from Trump to keep the gavel has aimed to strengthen their alliance particularly as Johnson has come under fire from his own caucus in the House including a failed effort at his removal by a fellow Trump backer U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.

Johnson made an appearance with the former president at his Mar-a-Lago club last month to announce new House legislation to require proof of citizenship for voting echoing Trump’s baseless claims that Democrats are abetting immigrants entering the U.S. illegally to swing elections — another potential route for Republican challenges to the 2024 election.

There isn’t any indication that noncitizens vote in significant numbers in federal elections or that they will in the future.

And Johnson joined Trump on stage for the Republican National Committee’s gala at Mar-a-Lago earlier this month praising the presumptive presidential nominee and saying House Republicans fully expect to ride Trump’s coattails to their own re-elections to keep the majority hold on the chamber.

Johnson has been using the pulpit of the speaker’s office in Washington to attack the U.S. judicial system criticizing the courts as biased against the former president claiming the case is politically motivated by Democrats and insisting Trump has done nothing wrong.

The speaker has demurred when asked if the 2020 election was legitimate and in a departure from the tradition of trust and adherence in U.S. election systems Johnson and other Republicans have hedged when asked if they will accept the election results of 2024.

A teenager from Chicago walked in her graduation ceremony this month after earning her doctoral degree at 17.

Dorothy Jean Tillman II told ""Good Morning America"" that she was homeschooled in her early years before entering college at age 10.

In 2020 she said she earned a Master of Science degree and then one year later at age 15 was accepted into the Doctorate of Behavioral Health Management program at Arizona State University.

In December 2023 at 17 Tillman successfully defended her dissertation to earn her doctoral degree in integrated behavioral health from ASU's College of Health Solutions.

On May 6 she walked at ASU's spring commencement ceremony.

Tillman told ""GMA"" she has always held education in such high regard in part due to her family's background.

""People in my life like my grandmother who was part of the Civil Rights movement she of course harped on the importance of education and consistently learning something always"" Tillman said. ""But the way I always held education so high on my own aside from being raised that way was finding different things to be educated about.""

She continued ""I feel like that urge to learn something new just never didn't exist for me.""

Dr. Lesley Manson a clinical associate professor at ASU told ""GMA"" that Tillman is the youngest person in school history to earn a doctoral degree in integrated behavioral health.

Manson said she oversaw Tillman's dissertation for the doctoral program offered through ASU Online.

During her studies Tillman wrote a journal article of her dissertation and completed an internship at a university student health center according to Manson.

""She really led change and worked on different forms of management to really reduce healthcare stigma and improve that student population there to be able to enter and accept student health services"" she said of Tillman. ""It was wonderful to see her and help her navigate some of those personal and professional interactions and grow through those experiences.""

Manson described Tillman as an ""inquisitive"" and ""innovative"" student and emphasized just how rare it is to accomplish what she has so far.

""It's a wonderful celebration ... but this is still something so rare and unique"" she said. ""She has innovative ideas and motivation which is wonderful and truly I think what is inspiring is that she embodies that meaning of being a true leader.""

Manson said she hopes Tillman continues to inspire people with her love of learning saying ""That curiosity is always there and I think all learners come with that but it's great to be able to see it in someone so young as well.""

Her inspiration and how she gives back to community

Tillman said her own journey wouldn't be possible without the support of her mom who she said is one of her biggest motivators.

""Seeing my mother consistently work so hard to continuously uphold our family's legacy and be that person that everyone was able to go to if they needed anything ... always seeing [her] like [a] 'wonder woman' definitely made me want to grow up [into] an accomplished person"" she said.

An advocate for education Tillman is also the founder and CEO of a leadership institute that emphasizes the arts and STEM.

""I feel like adding art and putting a focus on it throughout science technology engineering and math makes the kids excited to learn all those things"" she said. ""And it opens them up to all of the possibilities and all the knowledge provided in that area of just STEM.""

As for her plans after graduation Tillman said she is ""just like any other teenager still figuring out what my specific dreams and goals are.""

""I'm really just grateful that the world is my oyster and that I've done so much so young"" she said. ""And I have time to kind of think that through.""

Tillman added that she hopes young people will take away from her story that it's OK to continually figure out what you want to do in life.

""Always remember that everyone has points in their life where they feel like they're figuring it out"" she said. ""And so figuring things out not knowing what you want isn't a bad thing. But making the choice not to sit down and try to figure it out is.""

The design software company one of Marin’s most successful startups notified the state Employment Development Department of its plans “as a courtesy and in an abundance of caution” in an Aug. 15 letter.

The letter stated that Autodesk’s San Rafael office at 111 McInnis Parkway will be closing for good effective Oct. 14.

“All 578 employees who are currently assigned to the San Rafael office will have their assigned office transferred to our office at the Landmark at One Market Street San Francisco” said Autodesk executive Rebecca Pearce.

The letter stated that most of these employees are now designated as hybrid workers and therefore do not have mandatory weekly in-office days. Only five employees are office based and will be required to work in the San Francisco office.

Autodesk spokeswoman Mary Garofalo said the company has “ramped up” a new workplace model that divides employees into three groups: office based hybrid or home based.

“The majority of our global team falls within the hybrid category meaning they split their time between their homes and local commutable Autodesk offices” Garofalo said. “At this time Autodesk is not requiring employees to come into an office on any fixed or mandatory weekly schedule.”

Garofalo said Autodesk has 12600 employees worldwide but she declined to disclose how many of those employees work in the United States.

Reacting to the news of Autodesk’s move Mike Blakeley chief executive officer of the Marin Economic Forum said “It’s always a big deal if you lose a name brand business that has been an important part of the community.”

“Autodesk started here grew up here became a billion-dollar company here” he said. “That is significant in terms of establishing that kind of business can start and grow in Marin County. It’s like losing a good neighbor.”

Autodesk was launched in 1982 by 13 programmers who pooled about $60000 of their own money and worked out of co-founder John Walker’s two-bedroom home in Mill Valley.

The founders initially concentrated on developing a text editing program with spreadsheets before shifting their focus to a computer drawing program that was an instant hit at the COMEX trade show that November. The program would later become AutoCAD the company’s flagship product and cash cow.

In the 2021 fiscal year Autodesk reported a net profit of $497 million on revenue of $4.39 billion. Its software is used by a broad range of industries including the manufacturing architecture building construction media and entertainment sectors. The software has aided in the development of new technologies such as virtual reality robotics and 3D printing.

Autodesk’s decision to close its San Rafael headquarters comes on the heels of the company’s disclosure in January that it was giving up leases at 3900 Civic Center Drive in northern San Rafael and at 300 Mission St. in San Francisco. Autodesk’s lease of 46000 square feet at 3900 Civic Center Drive began in early 2020 and the company opened the 116000-square-foot office at 300 Mission St. last year.

Autodesk stated in its 2022 annual report that “the COVID-19 pandemic has spurred changes in the way we work as we move to a more hybrid workforce resulting in an evaluation of our office space needs.”

Accordingly the report said Autodesk planned to reduce its facilities portfolio worldwide and had incurred “impairment and accelerated depreciation charges of $103.7 million to assets associated with its operating leases for real estate during the fiscal year ended January 31 2022.” In finance an impairment is defined as a permanent reduction in the value of a company asset.

Autodesk also said it expects to incur additional impairments over the next several quarters amounting to as much as $25 million.

Between its annual reports in 2021 and 2022 the company shed 270000 square feet of leased office space leaving it with 1.83 million square feet at 101 sites in the United States and internationally.

Autodesk’s 2022 annual report indicated that its lease on the space at 111 McInnis Parkway extends until December 2024. It said the company has 284000 square feet of space in San Francisco under leases that have expiration dates ranging from December 2022 to June 2026.

Regarding the 162000 square feet of space that Autodesk has exited in Marin recently Haden Ongaro a North Bay executive for the Newmark real estate services firm said “I’m confident we’ll be able to lease those spaces but I hate to see a major employer leave Marin.”

Ongaro noted that Autodesk moved from Sausalito to the new building at 111 McInnis Parkway in 1994.

“Those buildings leased up pretty quickly” he said.

Ongaro said office space left behind when Lucasfilm Ltd. moved to the Presidio in 2005 and Glassdoor exited Mill Valley for San Francisco last year has also been filled.

According to Newmark’s most recent report on the Marin office market the vacancy rate was 18.5% at the end of June down from 19.4% during the second quarter of 2021. By comparison the San Francisco office market ended the second quarter of 2022 with a vacancy rate of 24.2% according to the Coldwell Banker Richard Ellis Group. Marin had an office vacancy rate of 16.3% in the second quarter of 2020.

Blakeley said the fact that a number of very successful companies have started in Marin and then moved away is not necessarily a bad thing.

“We look at it in a very positive light” he said. “You can start a billion-dollar publicly traded company in Marin County not many regions can say that.”

Blakeley said more recent success stories such as Restoration Hardware in Corte Madera Ultragenyx in Novato and BioMarin Pharmaceutical in San Rafael demonstrate that Marin retains its mojo for entrepreneurs.

“Obviously the conditions exist to start and grow a company here” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZ2luZWVyaW5nLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9ob3ctdG8tY2hlY2stc3lzdGVtLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLXdpdGgtYXV0b2NhZC1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1hbmFseXplctIBLWh0dHBzOi8vbW9iaWxlLmVuZ2luZWVyaW5nLmNvbS9hbXAvMjYxNzEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Check System Performance with AutoCAD Performance Analyzer,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9kZXNrLmNvbS9jb21wYW55L25ld3Nyb29tL2NvcnBvcmF0ZS1pbmZvL2V4ZWN1dGl2ZS1iaW9zL3JhbWktcmFoaW3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rami Rahim,"Board of Directors

Businesses whether big or small know that understanding data is essential to making informed decisions that impact the organization’s bottom line. The emergence of new data from embedded devices mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) is accelerating and complicating insights. Here’s what Statista said in the recent reports “In 2021 it was projected that the overall amount of data created worldwide would reach 79 zettabytes and would more than double by 2025 with no end in sight.” (Reference as illustrated below)

Image Source: https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/

The same report also states the factors contributing to the rapid growth of data traffic. “It is the Internet of Things (IoT) which already connects the digital and physical worlds through a network of sensors. The data volume created by global IoT connections reached 13.6 zettabytes in 2019 and is forecast to amount to over 79 zettabytes by 2025.”

Apart from this the proliferation of business intelligence tools growing diversity of machine and human-generated data Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning Blockchain etc. are opening

more ways for information management and interpretation. But accessing this data poses a challenge for many organizations.

Harnessing data for informed decision-making gets difficult especially when reporting and utilities are across multiple vendors or paper-based. As a result manual data entry and collection limits an organization’s ability to understand its data usage on a granular level. Advanced technological solutions address such challenges effectively; however several companies have been slow to adapt their workflows and processes to take advantage of more scalable data collection options.

Confronting Data Collection Challenges with Automation

Though data-driven decision-making is crucial for creating values and driving businesses in the right direction it needs a mix of capabilities and actions—some technical some not. Automated data collection solutions combine human intelligence with RPA AI and ML. Whether proprietary or public data organizations can transform their raw unstructured data into tagged and schema-compliant XML fit for data products analytics AI/ML applications etc.

Listed here are the leading-edge tools and software for data capture and collection processes:

● Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

One of the well-established and proven technologies is Optical Character Recognition. Even after disrupting the traditional approach to document management once this technology remains as relevant as ever.

It is perfect for digitizing huge piles of electronic and paper documents and is widely used across healthcare logistics banking finance governing and more. Multipurpose OCR systems not only reduce the costs of capturing data but also help in automating routine manual tasks. This helps in freeing human resources from doing mundane repetitive tasks. In short the OCR solution is a prerequisite for cost-efficient document management.

● Optical Mark Recognition (OMR)

Optical Mark Recognition is another approach to managing documents. It is used to capture and speed up human-marked data. For example multiple-choice tests the results of polls surveys consumer feedback and so on. After scanning the documents the Machine Learning algorithms detect the location. It can recognize hand-written marks much faster than human employees. Hence businesses can complete routine tasks time- and resource-efficiently and foster workflow automation.

● Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR)

Intelligent character recognition aims at solving more sophisticated challenges. Using this technology machines can easily process raw hand-written documents. The level of accuracy varies from 50% to 70%—depending on cursive handwriting block letters fonts styles etc. Bonus point this level of accuracy can be improved via further training the Machine Learning algorithm on rich datasets of specific data.

● Intelligent Document Recognition (IDR)

Volumes of unstructured documents are produced in complex business processes taking the case of the logistics and finance industry. Intelligent Document Recognition can extract data from any document part including meta description. It not only incorporates the capabilities of OCR but also enhances it. IDR technology can interpret tables patterns and content in electronic and paper formats by recognizing the beginning and end of documents and categorizing them. Any required data can be extracted whether stored in a database or used in business apps.

● QR Code Recognition

As data occurs in different formats for instance being encrypted in QR codes automated data capture can be conducted via different systems. This scan-and-go system has transformed the traditional way of shopping by facilitating hassle-free payments check-out-free stores self-servicing etc. QR code recognition has become a novel solution for many industry giants like Walmart Amazon Starbucks and the likes of the same for capturing data on merchandise and making payments.

● Voice Recognition

Voice assistants like Siri Cortona Alexa and Google Assistant are powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology. Simply say “Hey Siri” or “Google” to awaken the system dictate the command and get your answer.

NLP approaches based on deep learning algorithms are used in different areas such as marketing interpreting security support services etc. NLP embedded in electronic data capture systems helps collect clinical trial data or patient data that can be entered manually or via voice.

Final Words

Decisions processes and actions that use data can be automated in a variety of ways as stated but fall somewhere between mostly human-based and completely automated. In the age of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence companies that embrace some degree of automation in their core processes such as data collection and capture processes are more likely to gain a competitive advantage—through rapid granular and more sophisticated decision-making. Gartner also predicts that by 2025 “95% of decisions that currently use data will be at least partially automated.” Hence leaders can efficiently create decision intelligence with organizational competency.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The video features the employee Sammy (@sammylocodoee) as he works behind the counter at an AutoZone location and speaks to a customer who wants to return window washer fluid. For a minute and a half Sammy and the customer are speaking in circles Sammy repeatedly explaining how AutoZone can’t accept the bottle with a cracked seal.

The customer then continually protests Sammy’s rejection claiming that he should be allowed to return the item as he ensured the fluid was at the same level as when he first purchased it.

Sammy explains that he can’t accept the return due to the store’s policy.

“I’ve shopped here for over 2 years now” the customer replies noting that he’s always been able to return items at both AutoZone and O’Reilly. “I’ve never had this issue with you.”

The worker once again explains that once the seal is broken he is unable to accept a return. “I don’t know if you used it” he says. “You could’ve poured Gatorade in it.”

The customer then demands to speak to the manager.

“I am the manager” Sammy responds before the customer then requests to speak to the district manager.

“His number is on the front door and on your way out you can read the return policy” the worker adds.

Before leaving the customer accuses Sammy of being “completely unprofessional.” The TikToker then apologizes for the inconvenience and wishes him a good day.

“Go fuck yourself” the customer responds while walking away.

According to AutoZone’s website requests for a refund can be denied if the item has been used or installed. The only way to receive a refund is to return the product within 90 days in its original packaging along with the receipt.

The video has amassed 1.1 million views as of Sunday. Many people in the comments sided with Sammy and commended him on his professionalism in dealing with the “Karen.”

“‘This is completely unprofessional you know that?’ This is one of the most professional exchanges i’ve ever seen” one user complimented.

“You were very respectful too” a second said.

“‘I am the manager’ that made me so happy. You weren’t rude. You didn’t get scared. Good for you!” a third wrote.

Additionally several others claiming to be O’Reilly Auto Parts employees said they also don’t accept open containers.

“As an O’Reilly employee if it’s cracked we don’t return it as well” one user confirmed.

“I do the same at O’Reillys. Seal broken no returns. Electrical part installed can’t return” a second concurred.

The Daily Dot reached out to Sammy via TikTok comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29hc3RhbC5jb20vYnV6ei9idWlsZGluZ3VwamF4L2EtcnVubmluZy1saXN0LW9mLXdoYXRzLWNvbWluZy10by1ub3J0aGVybi1zdC1qb2hucy1jb3VudHkv0gFlaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVjb2FzdGFsLmNvbS9idXp6L2J1aWxkaW5ndXBqYXgvYS1ydW5uaW5nLWxpc3Qtb2Ytd2hhdHMtY29taW5nLXRvLW5vcnRoZXJuLXN0LWpvaG5zLWNvdW50eS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Running List of What’s Coming to Northern St. Johns County,"LAST UPDATED: Sept. 3 2022

Among the offerings a few standouts at Heritage included some coins that are rarely seen like a Professional Coin Grading Service certified About Good 3 1930-S Saint-Gaudens gold $20 double eagle with a green Certified Acceptance Corp. sticker that realized $44400 on Aug. 24.

The San Francisco Mint issue is a late rarity in the series with around 75 estimated to have survived from 74000 struck since most were melted around the time of issue. Nearly all survivors are Mint State or nearly so but this one has extensive wear with design elements that merge with the rim.

Heritage wrote: “This coin was clearly carried as a pocket piece and it may well be unique in this grade among 1930-S double eagles. A true once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the low-ball Registry collector.”

It's been that way nearly since the beginning of the pandemic when the company sent most of its workers home leaving the 450000-square-foot office building nearly empty. And like a lot of large companies Prudential began re-evaluating its space needs.

Late last month the company sold the property to a pair of development companies that decided that although the building is only 42 years old it doesn't have the features and amenities most companies want. Demolition is the only sensible option they determined.

""It's getting more and more difficult to fill existing [office] space ... and that's a really tough building to repurpose"" said Jeff Koch principal partner of Twin Cities-based Roers Cos. ""But it's a perfect site for residential.""

Koch and Dan Salzer a director of development for Scannell Properties said that over the next five years the team plans to spend $300 million to build 12 to 15 buildings that will include rental apartments medical offices and retail space in what will become one of the biggest redevelopment projects in the metro.

While there's plenty of demand for housing demand for traditional office space is weak and the future of the sector remains uncertain brokers say.

An estimated 18 to 25 % of all office space in the Twin Cities is empty and the situation is likely to worsen as leases expire and companies downsize leaving vacancy rates elevated for the ""foreseeable future"" according to a new report from Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL)

The group said the average vacancy rate for offices across the metro has increased slightly since the beginning of the year rising to 18% during the second quarter.

""Large tenants are still hunkered down and figuring out how and what hybrid work means"" said Jon Dahl a managing director in Minneapolis for JLL.

He said smaller companies are having an easier time determining their future space needs because they have a better handle on what works and what doesn't. Most of the active shoppers are in the market for spaces with 2000 to 10000 square feet. A few companies Dahl said are on hunt for 30000 to 40000 square feet.

""Small tenants are wanting new space and moving into new buildings"" he said. ""But there's a lot more movement than there normally would be.""

Dahl said that in a normal market there's a 75% probability of a tenant renewing but those odds are now below 50%. Still Dahl thinks the vacancy rate in downtown is close to leveling out.

Cushman Wakefield's estimates are even more dour. The company's second-quarter report shows that the average office vacancy rate across the metro was closer to 25% after hovering at around 18% for the three years prior to the pandemic.

The group said that leasing activity across the metro has remained relatively steady over the past several quarters. But for the eighth consecutive quarter more office space has been vacated than occupied.

Excluding the massive vacancy at City Center after Target Corp. left the building absorption during the second quarter was slightly positive given that several companies have signed leases and there have been several high-profile move-ins especially in downtown Minneapolis.

Those recently signed deals included Fox Rothschild which is taking nearly 40000 square feet of that former Target space. ESG Architecture & Design said it will take 20000 square feet at the new North Loop Green. In both cases however those new leases are downsizings from previous offices creating a net increase in available space.

During the second quarter Agiliti and HelpSystems moved into One Southwest Crossing and the Pohlad Cos. and JLL moved into their new office space at the RBC Gateway tower.

Demand has been especially strong in the North Loop which is now back to pre-pandemic leasing levels. The buildings in that area he said have the kinds of amenities and features that many companies want. Canteen One for example announced a move from the suburbs to a more than 40000-square-foot space in the North Loop.

""Companies are not shying away from quality space"" Paul Donovan executive director at Cushman Wakefield said. ""They just want less of it.""

With more than 2.3 million square feet of ""active office requirements"" (companies looking for space) JLL says leasing activity might increase slightly in the second half of 2022. If so that could push some new speculative office development forward in downtown Minneapolis and St. Louis Park's West End.

Though the future of the office sector is uncertain many investors are still shopping for and buying office properties especially those with the best amenities and in the best locations.

There have been several notable deals this year including the recent sale of the 1.7 million-square-foot Normandale Lake Office Park to Opal Holdings its first acquisition in the Minneapolis-St. Paul market.

That property which was nearly fully leased quickly found a buyer after being marketed but it closed for slightly less than the $369 million the seller paid in 2014.

Overall though investment sales have been relatively slow since the beginning of the pandemic. Higher interest rates have put downward pressure on prices and rising construction costs have only made such deals more challenging.

Still higher vacancy rates aren't necessarily leading to bargains for redevelopment sites. Koch said that when he first contacted Prudential to see if it would be willing to sell even a portion of its property in Plymouth he expected a deal. That wasn't the case.

""We thought we'd see a fire sale for office properties"" Koch said. ""We thought we'd get this for pennies on the dollar.""

Koch said that even at market prices it still made sense to do the acquisition. He'd long seen opportunity in the rolling hills and ponds on the Prudential property which he passed on his daily commute.

So just after the start of the pandemic thinking the company might be looking to downsize its holdings he made the call. His timing was perfect. The company said it was willing to sell the entire property.

Since closing at the end of August the development process has just begun. Land preparation is expected to begin in 2023 and it'll take about five years to fully redevelop the site into retail medical office buildings multifamily residential and a business park.

""This is going to be a vibrant new destination for the community"" Scannell said. ""Where people can live work shop eat and gather.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taHNjZm9vdC5vcmcvYWNhZWZsc2hvcC8yMDIyL2Zhc2hpb24vcmVkLWNhcnBldC9jaGFzZS1zdG9rZXMtc2hpcnRsZXNzLXN1aXQtYnJvZ3Vlcy1iYWxsLW9mLWxpZ2h0LXZlbmljZS0xMjAzMzMyNDU0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chase Stokes Wears 'Topless' Suit & Patent Brogues at Ball of Light,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://www.mhscfoot.org/acaeflshop/2022/fashion/red-carpet/chase-stokes-shirtless-suit-brogues-ball-of-light-venice-1203332454/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taHNjZm9vdC5vcmcvYWNhZWZsc2hvcC8yMDIyL2Zhc2hpb24vcmVkLWNhcnBldC9jaGFzZS1zdG9rZXMtc2hpcnRsZXNzLXN1aXQtYnJvZ3Vlcy1iYWxsLW9mLWxpZ2h0LXZlbmljZS0xMjAzMzMyNDU0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vZm9vdHdlYXJuZXdzLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LW5ld3MvcmVkLWNhcnBldC96b29leS1kZXNjaGFuZWwtaGFsdGVyLWdvd24taGVlbHMtYmFsbC1vZi1saWdodC12ZW5pY2UtMTIwMzMzMjQ1My_SAX1odHRwczovL2Zvb3R3ZWFybmV3cy5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC1uZXdzL3JlZC1jYXJwZXQvem9vZXktZGVzY2hhbmVsLWhhbHRlci1nb3duLWhlZWxzLWJhbGwtb2YtbGlnaHQtdmVuaWNlLTEyMDMzMzI0NTMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Zooey Deschanel Sparkles in Bejeweled Halter Gown at Venice’s Ball of Light,"Zooey Deschanel made a glamorous entrance during the 2022 Il Ballo Della Luce (AKA “The Ball of Light”) in Venice.

Though the “New Girl” star’s footwear wasn’t visible it’s likely she wore a pair of pointed-toe pumps sandals or platform heels that matched her gown’s color or sparkling accents. All three styles have been seen across numerous red carpets and celebrity arrivals throughout the Festival’s first weekend this fall.

Cinched with one button the “Outer Banks” star’s top revealed he was wearing the suit sans shirt adding a sleek and nonchalant take to formalwear — a styling move that’s taken off as a top menswear trend seen on stars including Timothée Chalamet Dwyane Wade and Nick Jonas. Stokes was accompanied by his friend and fellow actor Gavin Leatherwood with the duo striking humorous poses for the cameras together.

Finishing Stokes’ ensemble was a set of black brogues crafted from glossy patent leather. The lace-up style appeared to feature almond-shaped toes adding an air of formality to the actor’s outfit.

Is Bank of America's new zero-down mortgage worth it?

Home buying is a notoriously expensive process and has gotten even more costly as property values have increased over the years. When you consider a modest 5% down payment lender fees which can run you up to 1% of the home's value and closing costs which can be as high as 6% of the loan's value buyers can pay close to $46800 upfront for a $400000 home — this still excludes other charges like the underwriting fee title check home inspection and appraisal fees. Offering a loan that doesn't require a down payment mortgage insurance or closing costs could lower the barrier to entry for homeownership. And when you spend less money on down payment and closing costs you can reserve more of your savings for paying for serious home repairs that need to be taken care of or emergency expenses that could arise as soon as you move in. Just keep in mind though that making no down payment means that your home loan will cover the entire value of the property and your monthly payments can be higher than they'd be if you paid a little upfront. You'll need to work with a financial planner or mortgage lender to make sure that the monthly payments will fit into your budget.

Who will be eligible?

While the goal of the program is to bring Black and Hispanic borrowers closer to homeownership people of all races can qualify for the Community Affordable Loan Solution. Eligibility will be based on income and the location of the property. It will also use credit guidelines based on factors such as timely rent utility bill phone and auto insurance payments to determine creditworthiness though there is no minimum credit score requirement. If you're interested in applying for a loan through this program you must also complete a homebuyer certification course provided by select Bank of America and HUD-approved housing counseling partners before submitting your loan application. ""Our community affordable loan solution will help make the dream of sustained homeownership attainable for more Black and Hispanic families and it is part of our broader commitment to the communities that we serve"" AJ Barkley head of neighborhood and community lending at Bank of America said in a statement.

Black and Hispanic families typically don't have a large stash of cash on hand to fund a home down payment and closing costs so Bank of America removing those barriers will certainly help someone on the hunt for home Indiana University finance professor Jun Zhu told CBS News.

""If you have a program with no down payment and no closing costs it can help minority families to fill the gap between available savings and upfront cash needed"" said Zhu an expert on mortgage financing and housing affordability.

To qualify for the Bank of America program applicants must seek to buy a home in one of the five cities and complete a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development-certified homebuyer course. Applicants won't need mortgage insurance after they've acquired the loan.

Rates of homeownership vary dramatically across racial and ethnic groups thanks to differences in wealth and the legacy of historic discrimination. About 7 in 10 White households own homes while only 4 in 10 Black households and 5 in 10 Hispanic households do according to the National Association of Realtors.

Bank of America says 6 of 10 signs point to no,"The S&P 500’s decline this year—it’s down nearly 18% since January—accelerated last week after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated more “pain” was ahead.

Has the market hit bottom? Bank of America Research based on its new list of 10 signals showing whether the stock market has hit bottom says no.

View this interactive chart on Fortune.com

The bank came up with the list released on Friday after analyzing “macro and bottom-up data encompassing policy valuation growth sentiment and technical trends” the researchers said.

As of Friday only four of the 10 criteria have been met. That means there are six more that must be hit before it’s really a market bottom at least according to Bank of America’s formula.

The four indicators that are considered triggered include the unemployment rate rising. The latest monthly jobs report released Friday showed that the unemployment rate rose to 3.7% in August from 3.5% the month prior a relatively good sign in terms of reducing inflation because it hints that the economy is slowing.

Additional positive indicators for a market bottom included the bear-to-bull ratio of major investors whose sentiments lean toward a more bearish outlook. The others were multiple bear market rallies of 5% or more (the bank says there have been two rallies of 5% or more so far) and the Purchasing Managers’ Index—a measure of the prevailing direction of economic trends in manufacturing—has improved on a year-over-year basis.

But six out of 10 signs have yet to turn favorable for a market rebound according to Bank of America.

The Federal Reserve must start cutting interest rates which would signal that inflation is under control (in fact the Fed has been increasing rates). Also the equity risk premium or excess returns over the risk-free rate that investors expect for taking on the incremental risks connected to the market must increase by more than 75 basis points.

Additionally the two-year Treasury yield must decline 50 basis points or more from its highs; the yield curve—a tool that helps understand the bond market—must steepen; the trailing price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 when added to the Consumer Price Index must be below 20; and there must be the presence of “Buy” signals within the Bank of America’s “Sell Side Indicator” that tracks average stock allocation recommendations by strategists.

In Bank of America’s view the market has more room to drop. And it’s unclear when all of the signals of a rebound will switch from red to green.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on August 31 affirmed a district court’s ruling that Verify Smart Corp had failed to plausibly allege an agency relationship between Wells Fargo and Bank of America (the “Banks”) and a banking industry group’s subsidiary sufficient to prove the Banks enlisted the subsidiary to challenge a patent they were contractually prohibited from challenging themselves.

Verify brought a patent infringement suit against the Banks for infringement of its multifactor-identification software. Bank of America challenged the patent but as part of a subsequent settlement agreement the Banks eventually agreed not to challenge the patent further. However following the settlement Askeladden LLC a subsidiary of the banking industry group The Clearing House Payments Company LLC (TCH) of which both banks were members challenged the patent at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) and got it invalidated. Verify then sued the Banks alleging they had breached the settlement by acting through Askeladden.

Verify argued that:

“(i) the Banks and their peer institutions own and control TCH; (ii) TCH owns and controls Askeladden;

(iii) TCH created Askeladden to challenge patents that adversely [a]ffect TCH’s owners including the Banks;

(iv) TCH controls Askeladden’s patent challenges on behalf of the Banks; and

(v) Askeladden has an established practice of suing patent owners after TCH’s member banks settle their patent challenges and it did just that here.”

Verify amended its complaint twice but the district court dismissed its Third Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim against the Banks for breach of contract and fraud because its reliance on Askeladden’s LLC Agreement “contradicted the existence of any agency relationship.” Specifically the district court said that several provisions of the LLC Agreement “suggest the opposite” such as the Agreement’s mandate that Askeladden “shall have a Patent Challenge Committee” whose purpose “shall be to independently implement manage and conduct that aspect of the Company’s Patent Quality Initiative directed to challenging the validity of low-quality patents as specified in the Patent Challenge Guidelines”; that the PCC “shall operate independently of the Executive Committee [TCH] and any other Person that is affiliated with or otherwise related to [TCH]”; and that although TCH could appoint individuals “to assist and support the activities of the [PCC]” they “shall have no authority to direct bind or otherwise control the activities of the [PCC].” The LLC Agreement also explicitly prohibited any requests that the PCC institute review of specific patents or patents of a specific patent owner “or any direction or suggestion . . . from the Executive Committee [TCH] or any other Person that is affiliated with or otherwise related to [TCH].”

The district court further found that Verify had failed to establish that the several individuals Verify identified as being associated with the Banks had “any authority to direct Askeladden to challenge patents” or that they had ever directly communicated with the Banks regarding the patent challenge.

On appeal the Third Circuit in a very brief discussion affirmed the district court’s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim explaining that although it agreed the timing of Askeladden’s challenge to the patent was “suspicious” it also agreed “that the LLC Agreement actually shows that the Banks do not control which patents Askeladden challenges.” Furthermore Verify had presented no facts showing that any Bank officer had authority or responsibility related to Askeladden.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3ZpZGVvLzYzMTE4MjAxMjAxMTLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bank of America experiments with zero-down mortgages for black Latino homes,Log in to comment on videos and join in on the fun.

The quaint village of Saltford nestled between the bustling cities of Bristol and Bath is more than just a passing point along the A4 Bath Road. Despite its location on a key route it boasts a tight-knit community where ""everyone knows each other and feels like they belong"".

Once perceived as lacking identity Saltford has transformed into a thriving hub for families couples and young people. Over the past decade the village has embraced numerous changes evident in the 'sold' signs dotting almost every street corner. Its prime position along a busy A-road and the scenic Bristol Bath railway path make it an attractive place to settle down.

Saltford offers a diverse range of homes from luxury properties with expansive driveways and mechanical gates to charming cottages adorned with plants and flowers. It also houses hidden architectural gems like the grade II listed Saltford House believed to have been built in the 1700s by architect Thomas Bennett for his personal use.

Like any desirable location house prices in Saltford reflect its growing popularity. However data from Rightmove indicates that the overall average price of homes there was £492222 over the last year marking a 10 per cent decrease from the previous year reports Bristol Live.

According to Rightmove's records ""The majority of sales in Saltford during the last year were semi-detached properties selling for an average price of £487400. Detached properties sold for an average of £571500 with terraced properties fetching £425000.""

Saltford offers easy access to Keynsham's town centre with a mere stroll and city centres and rural pubs are just a short drive away. The public transport system is quite capable with two primary services between Bristol and Bath the X39 and 39 still running every half hour into the pre-dawn hours despite the 2023 bus cuts that affected other areas. Additionally there's the A4 an hourly airport service.

Saltford also boasts places like The Riverside Inn on the banks of the River Avon and Thai Cafe on Bath Road offering delectable meal options. Though Thai Cafe primarily serves scrumptious Thai food in the evenings it has become such an integral part of the community that it invites people in for a daytime cuppa.

During a 2022 visit Nikki the proprietor of Thai Cafe shared: ""Saltford has become the place to be. Everyone knows each other and helps each other out.""

""I have been here for about 20 years. It used to be mostly retired people who lived here but we are getting more families and young people now.""

Nikki pointing to the restaurant's interior expressed her gratitude for local support: ""People around the village have helped to make the restaurant what it is today. If something is broken someone will help and fix it.""

She continued to praise the community spirit saying ""People in the community helped me to get the restaurant up and running when we had to shut for eight months. Everyone is so nice and so helpful. That's what makes the village so great the people in it. I feel like I belong.""

Highlighting the perks of village life Nikki added ""In Saltford you have things like parking space. You don't get that in most cities. I also know that if I walk home at 10pm from work I will be safe. You don't get antisocial behaviour around here.""

Overlooking the bustling Bath Road Thai Cafe benefits from the traffic calming measures. ""Luckily traffic is slowed down because of the traffic lights"" Nikki remarked.

""We do get a lot of cars go by but people have to get to work and we understand that. Those people the people that drive through the village aren't the people that live here.""

As the warmer months roll in Saltford becomes a haven for wild swimmers kayakers and paddleboarders boasting a picturesque marina and the Bristol Avon Sailing Club making it a perfect destination for water enthusiasts.

Salford Parish Council is at the helm of addressing local concerns in the village. A spokesperson for the Parish Council shared with BristolLive their pride in the community stating: ""Many people who live and work in the village make Saltford a great place to be through their voluntary contributions which are celebrated annually through the Saltford Parish Council Community Awards. Much of the community activity is centred around Saltford Hall run by the Saltford Community Association.""

""Saltford is fortunate to have a community run Post Office and library on the A4 Bath Road as well as many active commercial businesses based around the village. Saltford is surrounded by green belt land which preserves its rural setting; care of the local environment is a matter close to many villagers' hearts as shown by the many members of the Saltford Environment Group and Saltford Wombles.""

""The village is served by the Bristol to Bath Railway Path which is popular with walkers and cyclists alike. As a rural community Saltford Parish Council welcomes considerate visitors who follow the countryside code who leave no trace of their visit by taking their litter home or use one of the many bins around the village. Saltford's residents appreciate considerate parking by visitors and use of public transport is strongly encouraged due to limited parking in the village.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXNzaGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzEyL3VwdG93bi1hcGFydG1lbnRzLXVudmVpbGVkLWluLXJlZGV2ZWxvcGVkLWRvd250b3duLWJhdGgtYmxvY2sv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uptown apartments unveiled in redeveloped downtown Bath block,"The Midcoast’s housing crunch eased slightly this month as developers unveiled 60 new Bath apartments geared toward senior residents.

The new apartment complex called The Uptown features 60 mostly one-bedroom apartments for tenants aged 55 and older. The apartments are for mixed-income households with rents ranging between $794 and $1495 per month. Around 42 apartments are classified as low-income according to developer The Szanton Company.

A large crowd gathered for the grand opening of the redeveloped Moses and Columbia Block Buildings on the corner of Front and Summer streets on May 8.

“There’s a housing shortage here and everywhere in Maine so the fact that we have one unit still available before we even open our doors speaks to the need for housing” said The Szanton Company Vice President Amy Cullen.

Around 10 existing units were already open in the Moses and Columbia building with Szanton adding four more units there Cullen said.

Applications for The Uptown opened in January with the apartments filling up in about one month leaving just one unit available at the time of the grand opening. The new tenants started moving into The Uptown on May 10.

“There is a housing crisis in the state and Bath is no exception” said Bath City Council Chairperson Mary Ellen Bell. “The Uptown project builds density in the downtown recreates underutilized space and provides attainable housing for some of our older residents.”

The newest addition of the building that connects to the renovated Columbia and Moses housing block sits on what used to be an empty lot that was once home to the Bath YMCA. Szanton bought the historic Moses and Columbia blocks back in 2020 with construction beginning in the summer of 2022 according to Cullen.

“The rehab of the existing historic building Moses and Columbia block that this project contains had a lot more work than we expected” Cullen said.

Most of the new tenants come from the Bath area with some coming in from out of state.

“For years to come these affordable homes are going to be a remarkable and lasting tribute to those who have worked so hard for affordable housing in this City of Ships” said MaineHousing Director Daniel Brennan.

When Berkshire Hathaway Inc. started trimming its stake in BYD Co. theories swirled about the prospects for China’s largest electric-vehicle maker. Turns out it’s less about the company and more about Warren Buffett being Warren Buffett.Berkshire has begun shedding BYD stock  dragging down the firm’s shares as traders feared an exit by its most notable backer. For BYD with profit that just tripled and a nearly 30% share in China’s expanding electric-car manufacturing market the stock sales struck some as puzzling.But the share sales probably don’t reflect concerns about BYD’s fundamental business and rather underscore the billionaire investor’s relentless focus on intrinsic value according to analysts. Buffett Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive officer has made billions of dollars from the holding since he invested around $230 million in 2008. The stake is now worth north of $8 billion.“Berkshire has benefited greatly from what BYD’s done -- they’ve made wonderful money” said Cole Smead president of investment firm Smead Capital Management. “He’s watched it grow and now based on the price the open market is giving right now he’s saying: I’m willing to take money off the table to go elsewhere.”Berkshire didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.BYD shares plunged 7.9% in Hong Kong on Wednesday the most in seven weeks and the worst performance on the benchmark Hang Seng Index. The selling followed Berkshire’s filing to the exchange late Tuesday saying its holding of BYD’s Hong Kong-listed shares had fallen to 19.92% from 20.04% on Aug. 24.Buffett is a disciple of the value strategy which focuses on long-term intrinsic value with a goal of buying shares in good firms at reasonable prices. That way investors avoid fast-growing firms with expensive stocks and the fickle gyrations of the market. Berkshire has held stakes in Coca-Cola Co. and American Express Co. for decades.It’s a strategy that’s served him well with Berkshire shares outpacing the S&P 500 Index since 1965 when Buffett took over the company.In recent years though analysts note there’s been more of a “trading component” to Berkshire’s equity portfolio which Buffett’s investing deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler help run. Berkshire has held certain stocks for shorter periods according to Meyer Shields an analyst with Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc.“There’s an increased willingness to adjust things down when they’re less attractive” Shields said. “Their sense is if this is now above intrinsic value as we assess it it may be good to sell the stock. Given where the BYD price is that has to be the conclusion they’re drawing.”Buffett has certainly ridden the BYD wave. Shares in the company gained 31% last year and surged 423% in 2020 as it benefited from China’s shift from gasoline and diesel-powered cars to electric vehicles. BYD also produces semiconductors and is now the world’s third-largest producer of batteries for EVs with 14% of the market.Theories about Buffett’s plans for the electric-car maker have percolated since a 20.49% stake -- identical to the size of Berkshire’s last reported BYD position in Hong Kong as of the end of June -- entered the Central Clearing and Settlement System in July a sign to investors a sale may be imminent. That triggered the biggest slump in BYD stock in nearly two years.The appearance of that stake in the clearinghouse likely means Buffett eventually intends to exit according to Smead.After trimming its stake further Berkshire has now jettisoned 3.05 million BYD shares or 1.4% of Buffett’s known 225-million-share holding. Its interest in BYD’s Hong Kong-listed stock has now fallen to 18.87% from 19.02% with the latest securities sold for an average of HK$262.72 apiece. It’ll likely continue to sell chunks this way Smead said.“If your ultimate goal is to exit the investment altogether it doesn’t look good in the eyes of the Chinese regulators for Buffett to come in and sell aggressively and disrupt the market” he said. “If they want to do future investments with China they are better off selling this way.”Berkshire started investing in BYD after Buffett’s long-term business partner Charlie Munger -- who bought the stock with Himalaya Capital’s Chairman Li Lu -- recommended the investment. Li once a contender to manage Berkshire’s investments and a BYD shareholder for more than a decade cut his stake to about 5% last year representing a 28% reduction.Munger has been bullish on China even amid worsening relations between Beijing and Washington. At Berkshire’s annual meeting this year Munger said he invested in the country because he was “willing to take a little bit of risk to get into the better companies at the lower prices.”Berkshire invests in BYD stock through its energy business which also fully owns utility companies throughout the US. Energy is a “core pillar” of Berkshire’s operations according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Matthew Palazola. Berkshire last month won approval from US regulators to buy as much as 50% of Occidental Petroleum Corp. after spending months snapping up its shares.Whatever the fate of Berkshire’s BYD stake Palazola estimates it represents about 2% of Berkshire’s investment portfolio.“For moving the needle on the financials of Berkshire it’s minuscule” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wNC9ob3VzaW5nLW1hcmtldC1tYXAtaG9tZS1wcmljZS1jdXRzLXJlZGZpbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Map: How fast sellers are slashing home prices in America's biggest housing markets,"The Pandemic Housing Boom saw U.S. home prices spike an unprecedented 43% in just over two years. But that’s over now: Spiked mortgage rates have pushed the U.S. housing market into a sharp slowdown that could threaten some of those gains.

Some firms—including John Burns Real Estate Consulting Zonda and Zelman & Associates—are already predicting that U.S. home prices in 2023 will post their first year-over-year decline of the post–Great Financial Crisis era. In a sharp housing downturn scenario Fitch Ratings thinks a 10% to 15% national home price decline is possible. Not everyone agrees. Goldman Sachs and Zillow predict that U.S. home prices will rise another 1.8% and 2.4% respectively over the coming year.

While industry insiders are still debating whether national house prices will post year-over-year declines there’s a consensus that some regional markets will see prices go down.

To get a better idea of which regional housing markets could first see year-over-year home price declines let’s look at list prices. While a spike in slashed list prices doesn’t guarantee a market will post year-over-year home price declines it does mark a trajectory change. Long before a market actually posts a year-over-year price decline it would have seen a spike in list price cuts.

Among 97 regional housing markets measured by Redfin the average market saw 34% of home listings get a price cut in July. That’s the highest-ever reading on Redfin. It’s also well above the 25.7% in May 2022 and 21% in July 2021.

“Nationwide the share of homes for sale with price drops reached a record high in July. Sellers had to cut their prices because they were catching up with buyers who had come to expect lower prices amid a cooling market. Rising mortgage rates and the prospect of falling home values also made buyers hesitant to pay sky-high prices and an uptick in supply gave them more to choose from. Price drops are likely to flatten out as sellers come to terms with the shifting market” write Redfin researchers.

The regional housing markets seeing the highest share of price cuts are in the very places that saw the biggest price gains during the pandemic. Just look at Boise. During the Pandemic Housing Boom prices in Boise soared over 60%. But as the market shifted Boise got hit the hardest. In July 70% of home listings in Boise saw a price cut. That's up from 30% in July 2021.

According to data collected by John Burns Real Estate Consulting home prices are already falling in Boise. Those month-over-month Boise price drops can already be found in Zillow data. Before the end of the year John Burns Real Estate Consulting predicts that Boise will be the first U.S. market to post a year-over-year price decline.

It isn't just Boise. The West—the epicenter of the Pandemic Housing Boom—has shifted very fast. Just behind Boise are Denver (where 58% of listings saw a price cut in July) Salt Lake City (56%) and Tacoma (55%). Markets like Phoenix (where 50% of listings saw a price cut) San Diego (50%) and Stockton Calif. (47%) also rank near the top.

Why are Mountain West and West Coast markets shifting so fast?

“The strong demand over the past two years drove up home prices across the country and it appears the West hit the pricing ceiling quicker than other markets given the particular supply constraints” Ali Wolf chief economist at Zonda told Fortune.

Simply put: The intense bidding wars out West—which were exacerbated by tight inventory—pushed home prices to buyers’ breaking point.

The data seems to agree with Wolf.

Regional housing markets that became the most detached from underlying economic fundamentals are now cooling the fastest. Places like Boise and Austin saw home prices rise to bubbly levels amid the Pandemic Housing Boom. Once historically low mortgage rates disappeared earlier this year would-be buyers in those markets began to feel the full brunt of record home price appreciation. That's why this summer many shoppers in places like Boise and Austin called off their search.

Heading forward these bubbly housing markets are at the highest risk of sharp price corrections. Peak to trough Moody's Analytics expects national home prices to decline between 0% to 5% amid this housing slowdown. However in significantly ""overvalued"" markets like Boise and Austin Moody's Analytics expects 5% to 10% home price drops. That's assuming no recession. If a recession hits Moody's Analytics expects a 5% to 10% national home price decline and 15% to 20% declines in the nation's 187 significantly ""overvalued"" markets.

To explore Tfeb expression during embryonic development we used a TfebEGFP mouse model in which the EGFP gene is knocked into the Tfeb locus resulting in the fusion protein TFEB-EGFP (Fig. 1a)33. At E11.5 Tfeb-EGFP was expressed in the heart myocardium and at a particularly strong level in epicardial cells (Fig. 1b) and in placental trophoblasts and endothelial capillaries (Supplementary Fig. 1) as previously reported3338. To further investigate whether Tfeb expression correlated with a particular stage of epicardial development we analyzed EGFP expression in the heart tissues of wild-type and TfebEGFP mice from E9.5 to E15.5 and in adults (Fig. 1c). Tfeb was specifically expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of WT1+ cells in the PE at E9.5 and in the epicardium up to E15.5. The expression decreased during development and was barely detectable in adult epicardial cells (Fig. 1c). To determine whether Tfeb expression differs in epicardial and epicardially derived cells undergoing EMT we costained hearts at E13.5 for EGFP and markers of EMT (Fig. 1d). Epicardial cells localized above the basement membrane that was stained with an anti-laminin antibody contained a significantly higher amount of TFEB-EGFP than EPDCs localized in the subepicardial space between the basement membrane and the myocardial surface (Fig. 1d i). Staining for the EMT-associated transcription factor Slug46 demonstrated that epicardial TFEB-EGFP+ cells had only 9% Slug+ nuclei while subepicardial TFEB-EGFP- cells had 56% Slug+ nuclei (Fig. 1d ii). Accordingly subepicardial TFEB-EGFP- cells were positive for PDGFRα or PDGFRβ which are markers of fibroblast and SMC differentiation respectively1112 (Fig. 1d iii iv). To further verify the correlation between Tfeb expression and the epithelial state of epicardial cells we cultured epicardial explants from E11.5 TfebEGFP hearts and induced EMT by TGFβ1 treatment. Figure 1e shows that TGFβ1 challenge resulted in a mesenchymal phenotype as shown by the development of α-smooth muscle actin (SMA)+ stress fibers and the increase in cell size. TFEB-EGFP was present in the nuclei of untreated epicardial cells and was reduced twice in cells differentiated into α-SMA+ myofibroblasts.

Values are shown as the number of nuclei and Fisher’s exact test p value is indicated. iii iv Cells positive for TFEB-EGFP were considered TFEB-EGFP + epicardial cells negative for TFEB-EGFP and localized above myocardial surface–TFEB-EGFP- subepicardial.

To implement a more suitable model to study TFEB functions we derived a mouse embryonic epicardial cell line (MEC) as described in ref. 47. MECs showed a typical epicardial cobblestone-like morphology (Supplementary Fig. 3a) with cortical distribution of the tight junction protein ZO1 (Fig. 2a) expressed the epicardium-specific TFs WT1 and TBX18 and did not contain contaminating cells such as endothelial cells (ECs; CD31+) cardiomyocytes (cTnT+) fibroblasts (PDGFRα+) and SMCs (PDGFRβ+; Supplementary Fig. 3b). TGFβ1 treatment triggered EMT as inferred by the increase in cell size the loss of WT1 and ZO1 and the positivity for the smooth muscle proteins αSMA and Sm22α (Fig. 2a). MECs expressed TFEB but during EMT both TFEB transcript and protein levels gradually decreased (Fig. 2b c). Both in primary epicardial cells and in MECs Tfeb was the most highly expressed member of the MITF family (Fig. 2d).

Fig. 2: Tfeb is downregulated during EMT in MECs. a MECs undergo EMT upon TGFβ1 treatment. MECs were treated with 10 ng/ml TGFβ1 in 2% FCS for 24 and 48 h to trigger EMT and then fixed and immunostained for epithelial (ZO1) epicardial (WT1) and SMC (αSMA and Sm22α) markers. The experiment was repeated three times with similar results.

Tfeb overexpression in the embryonic epicardium is lethal due to an impairment of EMT

Tfeb downregulation in epicardial cells during EMT suggested its role in EMT regulation. To investigate this possibility we generated a mouse model in which Tfeb expression in EPDCs persisted.

Tfeb-flagfs mice48 were crossed with mice expressing Cre under the control of the epicardium-specific Gata5 promoter8 (Fig. 3a). Tfeb overexpression in the epicardium was lethal. At weaning the analysis of 54 animals showed the absence of Gata5+; Tfebfs mice in contrast with the 25% expected Mendelian frequency given that the parents were heterozygous for Gata5 and Tfebfs alleles (χ2 test; p value <0.001; Table 1). To establish when exactly the embryos died we collected litters at different gestational stages. At E17.5 among the 29 collected embryos no live Gata5+; Tfebfs embryos were found (χ2 test; p value <0.05; Table 1); however 2 of the 3 collected resorbed embryos had the Gata5+; Tfebfs genotype. The distribution of genotypes of the embryos collected before E15.5 was not different from the expected distribution (p value >0.99).

Fig. 3: Tfeb overexpression in the epicardium is lethal due to inhibited EMT and fibroblast and SMC differentiation. a Scheme of the transgenic allele used for the creation of the Tfeb-overexpressing mice.

Table 1 Tfeb overexpression in the epicardium is lethal Full size table

Gata5+; Tfebfs embryos at E15.5 were smaller than their wild-type littermates with hemorrhagic areas (Fig. 3b). Microcomputed tomography (Micro-CT) scanning (Fig. 3c d) revealed that the Tfeb-overexpressing embryos were edematous as indicated by the significant increase in pericardial cavity volume and demonstrated enlarged atria. Mutant mice also had a thinner compact myocardium layer with a significant decrease in thickness in the right ventricle and interventricular septum. Six of eight analyzed Gata5+; Tfebfs embryos developed an incomplete interventricular septum while the control littermates (n = 8) did not show any defects. Consistent with the fact that Gata5 is active in the PE at E9.5–10.58 Cre recombinase and TFEB-FLAG were already detected in WT1+ cells at E9.5 (Supplementary Fig. 4). Immunostaining of E15.5 hearts (Fig. 3e) showed that the epicardial layer of mutant embryos marked with WT1 was fully formed and expressed TFEB-FLAG indicating that Tfeb overexpression did not alter the survival or proliferation of epicardial cells. However many fewer WT1-positive cells were found inside the myocardium of the Gata5+; Tfebfs embryos (Fig. 3e). Moreover PDGFRβ+ and PDGFRα+ cells which are both derived from epicardial cells were strikingly decreased in the mutant hearts (Fig. 3e). The quantification of both the number of PDGFRα+ or PDGFRβ+ cells invading the myocardium and the depth of the invasion of each PDGFRα+ or PDGFRβ+ cell from the surface confirmed the severe phenotype (Fig. 3e). Taking all these observations together we hypothesized that Tfeb overexpression would halt the differentiation of EPDCs leading to the development of hearts with defects derived from the poor differentiation of epicardial cells in vSMCs and fibroblasts. Of note the CD31+ endothelial cell population was not diminished in the Gata5+; Tfebfs myocardium (Fig. 3e) according to previous findings that the coronary endothelium mainly derives from the endocardium and sinus venosus4950. To verify whether Tfeb overexpression influenced epicardial EMT or the subsequent migration and differentiation of EPDCs we analyzed the Gata5+; Tfebfs embryos at E13.5 when EMT has already begun16. To visualize epicardial cell delamination we immunostained the basement membrane with an antibody against laminin and counted epicardial cell nuclei localized above the membrane and subepicardial cell nuclei between the basement membrane and the myocardium surface (Fig. 3f i). In the control embryos the ratio between epicardial and subepicardial cells was 1:1.31 while in the Gata5+; Tfebfs embryos it was 1:054 suggesting a strong inhibition of derivation of mesenchymal cells (Fig. 3f i). We also quantified the epicardial cells and EPDCs positive for the EMT-activating TFs Slug Zeb and Twist51. These EMT markers were consistently reduced in the Gata5+; Tfebfs embryos: from 51% of Slug+ cells in the controls to 24% in the Tfeb-overexpressing epicardial cells and EPDCs from 31% to 16% for Zeb+ and from 28% to 7% for Twist+ (Fig. 3f ii–iv). No difference in proliferation rate evaluated as positivity for Ki67 was observed (Supplementary Fig. 5v). These data suggest that Tfeb overexpression severely inhibited but did not fully abolish epicardial EMT starting from the early stages.

TFEB regulates EMT in primary mouse epicardial cells and MECs

Thereafter we evaluated the effect of Tfeb overexpression on TGFβ1-induced EMT in primary epicardial cells isolated from the Gata5+; Tfebfs mice. Epicardial explants from the mutant embryos grew similarly to those from the wild-type embryos and contained TFEB-FLAG in the nuclei (Fig. 4a) indicating that overexpressed TFEB did not affect cell survival and proliferation. However the Gata5+; Tfebfs epicardial cells showed a significantly weaker response to TGFβ1 treatment as demonstrated by αSMA expression and cell size (Fig. 4b).

Superimposable results were obtained by infecting MECs with a lentivirus encoding the constitutively active TFEB mutant S142A26 under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter (MEC-TFEB S142A) (Supplementary Fig. 6a b). After induction TFEB S142A was localized to nuclei ensuring protein activity (Supplementary Fig. 6b) and after 2 days it did not show toxic effects as demonstrated by a slight increase in BrdU incorporation consistent with previous reports3334 (Supplementary Fig. 6c).

To further support the observation that TFEB S142A overexpression inhibited MEC response to TGFβ1 we analyzed the expression of 85 EMT-related genes such as myofibroblast-specific proteins and extracellular matrix components selected by Gene Ontology annotations in the MECs overexpressing TFEB S142A and treated with TGFβ1 by real-time PCR. Twenty-five genes were significantly downregulated in the doxycycline-treated MEC-TFEB S142A cells stimulated with TGFβ1 compared to the TGFβ1-stimulated MEC-TFEB S142A cells nontreated with doxycycline (Student’s test p value <0.05; Fig. 4c). Next we analyzed the expression of well-known EMT markers in a time-course experiment after TGFβ1 stimulation (Fig. 4d). Tfeb overexpression blocked the induction of the EMT-activating TFs Twist Zeb and Tcf21 and delayed and diminished the increase in the transcription factor Slug the mesenchymal markers CTGF and FN and the smooth muscle markers Acta2 and Tagln. This analysis was further validated by evaluating the protein levels of selected targets. Figure 4e shows that the increased expression of the Acta2 gene-encoded α-SMA and Tagln gene-encoded Sm22α proteins induced by TGFβ1 was blunted in the doxycycline-treated MEC-TFEB S142A cells.

Since overexpressed TFEBS142A acted as an inhibitor of EMT in MEC cells siRNA-mediated silencing was used to determine whether endogenous TFEB might have the same role (Supplementary Fig. 6d). We evaluated the expression of SMC markers (α-SMA and Sm22α) at the mRNA (Fig. 4f) and protein (Fig. 4g) levels and found that in the Tfeb-silenced MECs the SMC markers were upregulated. The expression of TFEB S142A after Tfeb silencing rescued the MEC phenotype (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig. 6e). Independent of the presence of TGFβ1 Tfeb-silenced MECs showed an upregulation of Acta2 and Tagln transcripts which was reduced after TFEB S142A reintroduction (Fig. 4h).

TFEB modulates EMT through TGIF1

To provide insights into the mechanisms sustaining the regulatory effect of TFEB in the mesenchymal transition of epicardial cells we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) in MECs overexpressing TFEB S142A. To prevent the possible side effects of excessive TFEB accumulation we set 8 h of doxycycline induction as the minimum to guarantee TFEB S142A overexpression in most of the nuclei (Supplementary Fig. 6g). The 8258 peaks of TFEB S142A DNA binding were called with medium stringency (Supplementary Fig. 7a). The annotation of peak genomic distribution executed by HOMER software52 showed that gene promoters and 5’ untranslated regions (UTRs) were strongly enriched among the TFEB target regions (Supplementary Fig. 7b). For further analysis we focused on the set of 1899 peaks superimposing mouse promoter regions defined as −2500 bp and +2500 bp from the transcription start site (TSS) of 1928 protein-coding genes annotated by GREAT 3.0.0 software53. Thirty-two percent of the TSS-associated peaks directly contained a TFEB-binding motif specified by the JASPAR matrix (relative score >0.6)54. Furthermore de novo motif discovery on the complete set of sequences of the TSS-associated peaks demonstrated a strong enrichment in the E-box CACGTG TFEB-binding motif (p value 10−29; Supplementary Fig. 7a). Functional annotation of TFEB target genes performed by GREAT (Supplementary Fig. 7c) revealed the most important enrichment for functional groups related to the regulation of transcription including DNA binding and TF activity itself as well as TF binding and cofactor activity. In terms of biology TFEB targets are involved in the regulation of cell differentiation epithelial phenotype cytoskeleton rearrangement adhesion and motility which are the processes underlying EMT. Notably among TFEB target genes there were components of the TGFβ/SMAD and PDGFR signaling pathways which are involved in epicardial EMT regulation.

We demonstrated above that the TFEB inhibitory effect on EMT was underpinned by the decreased expression of many genes. The presence of many transcriptional regulators and a marked enrichment of genes belonging to the TGFβ pathway in the ChIP-seq dataset prompted us to hypothesize that TFEB might directly upregulate a transcriptional repressor or an inhibitory cofactor of the TGFβ-activated gene response which is crucial for epicardial EMT. Among the TFEB ChIP-seq targets harboring this function the Tgif1 Ski and Skil genes were identified455556 (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 8a b). We excluded Ski and Skil after experimental validation. In MECs Ski expression did not depend on overexpressed or endogenous TFEB (Supplementary Fig. 8c). Skil mRNA expression was upregulated by TFEB S142A and downregulated by Tfeb silencing (Supplementary Fig. 8d); nevertheless Skil silencing did not rescue the inhibition of the Acta2 transcript by TFEB S142A overexpression (Supplementary Fig. 8e f).

TGIF1 was reported to inhibit TGFβ signaling by directly binding the SMAD2 and SMAD4 complexes and repressing TGFβ-induced SMAD-mediated transcription4445. ChIP-seq analysis revealed a peak of TFEB S142A binding overlapping the Tgif1 promoter region (Fig. 5a). Bioinformatic analysis of the sequence of the ChIP-seq peak revealed the presence of a TFEB Jaspar binding site. To demonstrate the direct activity of TFEB on the Tgif1 promoter we designed two luciferase reporter constructs with the Tgif1 full promoter sequence (−1106; +310 bp around the TSS) and the mutant version lacking the TFEB binding peak (pTGIF1-full and pTGIF1-del) which were transfected into MEC-TFEB S142A cells. The overexpression of TFEB S142 by doxycycline resulted in a 60% increase in pTGIF1 full promoter activity while no increase was observed for the mutated promoter (Fig. 5b). Accordingly immunofluorescence analysis showed an increase in TGIF1 protein expression in the TFEB S142A-MECs starting after 8 h of doxycycline treatment (Fig. 5c) and persisting after 24 and 48 h (Fig. 6b). This finding was confirmed by transcript analysis showing that Tgif1 mRNA expression was strongly upregulated upon TFEB S142A overexpression and downregulated in the Tfeb-silenced MECs (Fig. 5d).

To verify whether TFEB inhibited TGFβ1-induced EMT in the TFEB S142A-MECs by upregulating Tgif1 we performed a rescue experiment by simultaneous overexpression of TFEB S142A and knockdown of Tgif1 by a lentiviral vector carrying shTGIF1. After 24 h the cells were treated with TGFβ1. Doxycycline-induced TFEB S142A expression caused a strong increase in Tgif1 mRNA (Fig. 6a) and protein (Fig. 6b) expression which was mainly nuclear. Tgif1 silencing completely abolished the observed upregulation induced by TFEB S142A; however importantly it did not reduce the mRNA and protein levels below those in the untreated cells (Fig. 6a b). In addition our experiment showed the induction of TGIF1 by TGFβ1 under normal conditions confirming previous reports57. Fig. 6a shows that Tgif1 knockdown rescued the inhibitory effect of TFEB S142A on the upregulation of ACTA2 and Tagln mRNA after stimulation with TGFβ1. Similarly the expression of the Tagln gene-encoded Sm22α protein observed in the MECs challenged with TGFβ1 was inhibited by TFEB S142A overexpression but completely rescued by Tgif1 silencing (Fig. 6c). The increase in cell size which characterizes EMT was also controlled by the TFEB-TGIF1 signaling axis. Tgif1 knockdown abolished the TFEB S142A-induced inhibition of the cell size increase upon TGFβ1 treatment (Fig. 6c). Altogether the results of the rescue experiment suggested that TFEB inhibited TGFβ1-induced EMT in epicardial cells in vitro by directly upregulating Tgif1.

To validate these in vitro findings in vivo we analyzed the expression of Tgif1 in the epicardium of the Gata5; Tfebfs and control E15.5 embryos by immunofluorescence and found a strong increase in TGIF1 protein expression in the nuclei of the mutant embryos (Fig. 6d). This result was further confirmed in primary epicardial cells cultured from the Gata5+; Tfebfs and control embryos. Both under basal conditions and during the differentiation induced by TGFβ1 Tgif1 was significantly upregulated in the TFEB-overexpressing cells (Fig. 6e).

Altogether these data indicate that overexpressed Tfeb acts through Tgif1 upregulation ultimately inhibiting the cell response to TGFβ1 both in vitro and in vivo.

Dynamics of the TGFβ1 regulation of TGIF1 and TFEB

To investigate the physiological role of TFEB in TGIF1 regulation of TGFβ1 signaling we first examined the time-dependence of TGIF1 expression after TGFβ1 stimulation. For the transcriptional response to TGFβ1 signaling TGIF1 repression should be promptly lifted. This kind of regulation was shown for other TGFβ1 inhibitors such as Ski and SnoN: after TGFβ1 treatment the repressor proteins are rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery with the minimum level reached in 15–45 min; at the same time their mRNA is de novo synthesized leading to the restored protein level at ∼2 h56585960. To determine whether TGIF1 shares the same regulatory pattern we evaluated its mRNA and protein levels in MECs after TGFβ1 treatment in the absence and presence of the proteosome inhibitor lactacystin. TGFβ1 stimulation caused a significant decrease in TGIF1 protein expression after 15 and 30 min which was followed by a restoration of protein levels after 1 h and an increase after 24 h (Fig. 7a). Lactacystin completely abolished TGIF1 protein level decrease suggesting the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system degradation (Fig. 7a). A TGIF1 mRNA increase was observed starting from 1 h of TGFβ1 treatment (Fig. 7b). Therefore it is conceivable that similar to Ski and SnoN TGFβ1 caused rapid short-term TGIF1 protein degradation and long-term transcriptional upregulation (Fig. 7c). We also examined whether TGFβ1 had any short-term effects on TFEB protein levels and did not observe any effects (Supplementary Fig. 9a and Fig. 7c).

The role of the TFEB-TGIF1 axis in TGFβ signaling under physiological conditions

Because mechanistic information revealing the function of TFEB was obtained in Tfeb-overexpressing models we evaluated the TFEB-TGIF1 axis under physiological conditions. We found that endogenous TFEB inhibited mesenchymal differentiation of MECs (Fig. 4f g) and that in the Tfeb-silenced MECs Tgif1 was downregulated (Fig. 5d). Next we compared the effects of Tfeb and Tgif1 silencing on the TGFβ1-elicited dose-dependent transcription of the EMT marker gene Acta2 in MECs (Fig. 8a). As previously reported44 Tgif1 silencing sensitized and amplified the increase in Acta2 mRNA in response to both low and high doses of TGFβ1 (Fig. 8a). The shCtrl-expressing cells responded to TGFβ1 starting from concentrations of 0.5 ng/ml while Tfeb or Tgif1 silencing sensitized the cell response to 0.05 ng/ml TGFβ1. The shTFEB and shTGIF1 MECs showed significantly stronger responses to low concentrations (0.05–1 ng/ml) of TGFβ1. According to the interplay between TFEB S142A and TGIF1 demonstrated above (Fig. 6) it is likely that the sensitization effect of Tfeb deletion relied on the lack of TGIF1. To test this hypothesis we evaluated TGIF1 protein levels in the MECs with Tfeb silencing treated with low (0.05 ng/ml) and high (10 ng/ml) concentrations of TGFβ1 for 15 min the time point at which we observed the lowest level of TGIF1 (Fig. 7a). Low amounts of TGFβ1 (0.05 ng/ml) caused a 30% reduction in TGIF1 examined by immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 8b and Supplementary Fig. 9b) which was not sufficient to remove transcriptional inhibition of Acta2 (Fig. 8a). In the MECs stimulated with 10 ng/ml TGFβ1 TGIF1 was reduced by 60% which allowed a transcriptional response (Fig. 8b a). In the siTfeb MECs the TGIF1 protein level was low under basal conditions and 0.05 ng/ml TGFβ1 treatment resulted in a 60% reduction permitting a transcriptional response (Fig. 8b a).

Fig. 8: Tfeb silencing in MECs sensitized them to lower concentrations of TGFβ1. a Tfeb and Tgif1 silencing caused a stronger upregulation of the Acta2 transcript in response to low doses of TGFβ1. MECs were infected with a lentivirus coding for a shRNA for Tfeb or Tgif1 or control shRNA. Cells were treated with 0.05 0.5 1 5 and 10 ng/ml TGFβ1 for 24 h. The Acta2 mRNA quantity was assessed by real-time PCR analysis. Values are shown as the mean ± SEM n = 4.

Then the hearts were removed and the explants were cultured for 48 h in DMEM with 10% FCS and 0.5 ng/ml or 10 ng/ml TGFβ1 and immunostained for αSMA (representave images in top panel). The αSMA immunofluorescence signal was quantified in ImageJ software and five explants and at least four images for an explant were analyzed for an experimental point (plot in bottom panel). Box plot shows the quartiles the 5th and 95th percentiles (whiskers). Student’s two-tailed t test p values are reported in the plot. f A proposed model for the role of TFEB and TGIF1 in the regulation of TGFβ1 signaling. Under basal conditions TFEB expressed in epicardial cells is required to establish an appropriate quantity of TGIF1 protein. TGFβ1 stimulation rapidly initiates proteosome-dependent TGIF1 degradation; however a low concentration of TGFβ1 is not sufficient to remove TGIF1 repression thus creating a dose-dependent response.

To verify in vivo whether the lack of Tfeb had the same effects observed in vitro we generated a mouse model in which Tfeb was knocked out in epicardial cells by crossing Gata5-Cre with Tfeb flox/flox mice. The resulting Gata5+; Tfeb flox/flox mice were healthy and did not present visible pre- or postnatal morphological defects. No difference in the EMT intensity assessed as the number of delaminated mesenchymal cells and Slug+ epicardial cells and EPDCs was found in the E13.5 embryos (Supplementary Fig. 10). However the staining for PDGFRα and PDGFRβ revealed a significant increase in fibroblast and SMC precursors at E13.5 (Fig. 8c). These findings suggest a premature differentiation of the Tfeb-deleted EPDCs into SMCs and fibroblasts which however was recovered at later developmental stages.

We analyzed TGIF1 protein levels in epicardial cell nuclei of the E12.5 Gata5+; Tfebflox/flox embryos and found a 21% reduction compared to the controls (Fig. 8d). Therefore we investigated the response to TGFβ1 in epicardial cells cultured from the Gata5+; Tfebflox/flox embryos. The efficiency of Tfeb deletion in epicardial cells was confirmed by real-time PCR analysis of Tfeb mRNA in the mutant and control epicardial explants (Supplementary Fig. 10a). Next we cultured the Gata5+; Tfebflox/flox epicardial explants for 48 h in the presence of 0.5 or 10 ng/ml TGFβ1. Immunostaining revealed that low TGFβ1 amounts significantly increased the synthesis of α-SMA in epicardial cells isolated from the Tfeb knockout but not from the control animals (Fig. 8e).

Taken together these findings suggest a model (Fig. 8f) in which TFEB present in epicardial cells under physiological conditions is necessary to establish a TGIF1 protein quantity threshold allowing a dose-response to TGFβ1. TGFβ1 stimulation initiates rapid TGIF1 proteasomal degradation; however a high dose of TGFβ1 is required to reduce TGIF1 to a level that allows initiation of transcription. Long-term TGFβ1 treatment promotes an increase in TGIF1 protein probably functioning as a feedback mechanism.

It is likely that excess TGIF1 levels observed in the TFEBS142A-overexpressing MECs and in Gata5+; Tfebfs embryos strongly inhibited the response even to high doses of TGFβ1. In contrast an insufficient level of TGIF1 observed in siTfeb MECs and in Gata5+; Tfebflox/flox primary epicardial cells allowed the response to low doses of TGFβ1 which under physiological conditions do not promote a response.

TFEB regulates EMT in vascular endothelial cells and in epithelial MDCK cells

To verify whether the regulatory effect of TFEB on EMT is restricted to epicardial development or may represent a more general mechanism we investigated whether this function of TFEB occurs in other cell types. ECs physiologically express TFEB both in embryos and adults33 and undergo a process analogous to EMT named endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). EndMT is governed by a network of growth factors shared with EMT including the TGFβ family. However TGFβ2 is considered to be a stronger EndMT inducer than TGFβ16162. TFEB was expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) under basal conditions and downregulated by TGFβ2 treatment similar to what we observed in epicardial cells (Fig. 9a). TGFβ2 stimulation for 3 and 5 days triggered EndMT as demonstrated by the increase in SM22α expression while αSMA expression did not change significantly. TFEB S142A overexpression completely abrogated the upregulation of SM22α indicating the inhibition of EndMT (Fig. 9b).

Fig. 9: TFEB S142A overexpression inhibits EndMT in human endothelial cells and EMT in MDCK cells. a TFEB expression decreases during EndMT.

Finally we investigated the effect of TFEB on TGFβ-induced EMT in renal tubular epithelial cells (MDCK) a prototypical cell model of EMT63 (Fig. 9c). TGFβ1 treatment for 5 days induced EMT characterized by an increase in αSMA and SM22α and TFEB S142A overexpression strongly diminished αSMA expression. No effect of TFEB S142A on SM22α expression was observed in this cell type probably because it did not respond strongly to TGFβ in the first place.

Altogether this evidence supports the idea that the regulatory effect of TFEB on EMT is not confined to epicardial development but is a more general mechanism.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQyMDAzLTAyMi0wMzg4NS130gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Low dose rate γ-irradiation protects fruit fly chromosomes from double strand breaks and telomere fusions by reducing ...,"A 2.5 mGy/h dose rate gamma irradiation protects Drosophila chromosomes from ionizing radiation-induced chromosome damage

To investigate the effects of low dose rate irradiation on chromosome damage we assessed whether a pretreatment with chronic low doses of γ rays (priming dose) affects the frequency of total chromosome breaks (CBs; for examples of CBs see Fig. 1a) induced by an acute γ dose of 10 Gy (challenging dose) in Drosophila third instar larvae neuroblasts. Vials containing 12 h old Drosophila embryos were placed at 23 °C inside the LIBIS irradiation facility19 and irradiated continuously at a dose rate of 2.5 mGy/h until they developed into third instar larvae (7 days for a final dose of 0.4 Gy herein 0.4 Gy LDR). Irradiated and non-irradiated control vials were then exposed to a challenging dose at the dose rate of about 0.7 Gy/min and 4 h later larval neuroblasts were analyzed for CBs frequency (Supplementary Fig. 1). Chromosomes were fixed at 4 h and 8 h post irradiation time points (PIR) to recover cells that were irradiated in the S-G 2 or G 1 stage respectively20. The average number of total chromosome breaks per cell (CBs/cell) was calculated by measuring the ratio of the total number of chromatid deletions (CDs scored as a single event) and isochromosome breaks (ISOs or chromosome deletions scored as two events) to the total number of metaphases (Fig. 1b). Cytological analysis of exposed pretreated and non-pretreated third instar larvae showed that in non-pretreated larvae the average number of CBs/cell induced by the challenging dose after 4 h PIR was ~1.0 in females and ~0.8 in males. Differently the 0.4 Gy LDR determined a ~2 fold decrease of CBs/cell frequency in both male and female larval neuroblasts indicating that the LDR treatment renders neuroblast chromosomes resistant to IR-induced DNA breakage as a result of the activation of radioadaptive response (RAR). Interestingly a 1.2 mGy/h dose rate for 7 days (0.2 Gy total dose) was not sufficient to trigger a RAR suggesting that this response could be dose rate dependent (Supplementary Fig. 2a).

(A) Wild-type female and (D) male metaphases; (B) female and (C F) male metaphases with examples of isochromosome breaks (arrows); (E) male metaphase showing autosomal chromatid deletions (arrows). Bar = 5 μm. b Analysis of the frequency of CBs induced by the acute exposure to 10 Gy in 0.4 Gy LDR chronically treated and non-treated (NT) larvae after 4 and 8 h post irradiation (PIR) and in the first and the second generation from adults exposed to 0.4 Gy LDR during their development. Chromosome exchanges did not vary and were not considered in the analysis. The CBs frequency of 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy treated larvae at 8 h and 4 h PIR was compared with that of 10 Gy treated larvae at the same PIR times. The CBs frequency of 10 Gy treated F1 and F2 was compared with that of 10 Gy exposed controls after 4 h PIR. Note that CBs frequency of 0.4 Gy LDR treated larvae were indistinguishable from that of NT larvae. n = 3 biologically independent experiments were conducted.

We sought to understand whether the 0.4 Gy LDR could affect CBs frequency also at 8 h PIR when cells are irradiated during the G 1 stage. The analysis of ~1000 female metaphases revealed no statistically significant difference on CBs frequency between non-pre-treated (~54%) and 0.4 Gy LDR treated (~45%) larvae at 8 h PIR (Fig. 1b). This suggests that 0.4 Gy LDR could primarily influence the HR-based repair systems that by employing sister chromatids as template for the DNA synthesis to regenerate the sequence surrounding the break site is restricted to S-G 2 phase21. Furthermore we evaluated whether the radiation resistance could be also maintained for more than one generation. Thus male and female adult flies that developed from 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated larvae were mated to each other outside the LIBIS and the resulting F 1 larvae irradiated with 10 Gy. Interestingly we found that the frequency of CBs calculated at 4 h PIR was ~2 fold reduced in metaphases from both male and female F 1 larvae of 0.4 Gy LDR -derived adult parents (n = 1861 for both sexes) with respect to control F 1 larvae deriving from non-pretreated adults (Fig. 1b). This indicates that the RAR shows a transgenerational inheritance. However the F 1 obtained from reciprocal crossings between 0.4 Gy LDR-treated females or males and non-treated males or females respectively did not elicit RAR (Supplementary Table 1) suggesting that the transgenerational inheritance of RAR depends on both maternal and paternal factors.

To analyze whether the 0.4 Gy LDR affected the regulation of G 2 /M checkpoint we carried out a standard checkpoint assay evaluating the proportion of dividing cells (Mitotic Index MI) in larval brain cells fixed at different times after the challenging dose (10 Gy). As shown in Fig. 2a the MI of the non-pretreated Oregon R control brains dropped at 5–30 min PIR remained low for 1 h and came back to a normal value only at 2 h PIR. The MI of 0.4 Gy LDR -pretreated larvae decreased as much as in control brains at 5–30 min PIR but then markedly increased after 30 min PIR suggesting that the 0.4 Gy LDR exposure determined a faster recovery from the G 2 -M checkpoint (Fig. 2a) compared to non-pretreated cells most likely due to a reduced amount of DNA damage (~50%) to be repaired.

Fig. 2: The influence of cell cycle and DNA Damage Response (DDR) on the RAR. a Checkpoint assay of Oregon-R 0.4 Gy LDR chronically exposed Oregon-R larval brains versus non-treated (NT) controls. In the picture is shown the mitotic index (MI) calculated as the ratio between the total number of dividing cells and the number of optical fields. Note that the MI of 0.4 Gy LDR larvae increases after 60 min post-irradiation compared to NT control. n = 3 biologically independent experiments were conducted. Values of p < 0.05 (*) were considered as statistically significant (Student t-test). b EdU incorporation analysis of Oregon-R larval brain cells exposed to IR. EdU-positive cell nuclei of larval brains show 3 different incorporation patterns: S 1 represents early S phase nuclei that do not incorporate Edu in the DAPI-stained chromocenter; S 2 represents mid-S phase nuclei that incorporate EdU in all DAPI-stained nuclei; S 3 shows nuclei in the late S-phase that incorporate EdU only in the chromocenter. c Frequencies of EdU positive nuclei. The frequencies of EdU positive nuclei in each sample (NT 0.4 Gy LDR 10 Gy 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy) were obtained by examining at least 2000 nuclei from 3 brains. Values of p < 0.05 (*) were considered as statistically significant (Student t-test). d Quantification (%) of EdU positive cells divided in S1 S2 and S3 phases according to the staining pattern observed in (b). No statistical differences were observed in treated cells compared to controls. e DNA repair gene mutant larvae do not elicit RAR.

The ATPCL mutant was used as a control. Note that in all DNA repair (but not in ATPCLDG23) mutants RAR is abolished. ISOs isochromosome deletions CDs chromatid deletions CBs chromosome breaks NT non-treated PIR post-irradiation time. The comparisons of the CBs frequency were performed among 0.4 Gy LDR treated- and untreated mutants before and after the exposure to the challenging dose using Student’s t-test; †statistically significant for p < 0.01. Bar = 10 μm. Full size image

We also checked whether the rate of IR-induced apoptosis and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were influenced by the 0.4 Gy LDR. Immunostaining of whole-mounted brains and imaginal discs for cleaved-Caspase-3 revealed that the number of positive cells in treated larval brains was indistinguishable from that observed in non-pretreated control after the challenging dose indicating that RAR does not reduce the occurrence and distribution of apoptosis caused by extensive DNA damage (Supplementary Fig. 3a-d). Moreover using dihydroethidium (DHE) as an indicator we found that ROS levels in 10Gy-irradiated brains did not differ from those observed in 0.4 Gy LDR + 10Gy-irradiated brains although as expected they increased compared to unirradiated larvae (Supplementary Fig. 4). These results indicate that LDR does not lead to a statistically significant response to the ROS generating activity that could be taken into account to explain the radioresistance.

We finally compared the occurrence of DNA replication in non-pretreated and pretreated brain cells by analyzing the incorporation of the EdU (5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine) analog of thymidine before and after IR (see Materials and Methods). Before 10 Gy irradiation non-pretreated wild-type and 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated larvae exhibited a similar proportion of nuclei (~13%; n = ~2000 cells) that were actively replicating their DNA and incorporated EdU. However after irradiation whereas in non-pretreated wild-type brains the frequency of EdU-labeled nuclei dropped to ~6.5% (as a consequence of the arrest of S phase) 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated brains displayed a proportion of positive nuclei (~20%; n = ~2000 cells) very similar to unirradiated larvae (Fig. 2c). Based on the EdU incorporation pattern according to Cenci et al. 201522 we subdivided the S phase in three subclasses namely S 1 (early/mid S; nucleus partially or completely stained with the exception of the chromocenter) S 2 (mid/late S; staining at the chromocenter and at a less compacted nuclear area) and S 3 (late S; only chromocenter stained; Fig. 2b). This classification revealed us that pretreated and non-pretreated cells did not differ in the relative frequencies of nuclei showing S 1  S 2 and S 3 EdU incorporation patterns (Fig. 2d). Altogether these results indicate that 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated cells recover much faster than non-pretreated controls from the DNA damage-induced replication block.

The RAR to chromosome aberrations relies on a more efficient DNA damage response

To determine whether the reduction of chromosome breaks promoted by 0.4 Gy LDR depends on the presence of proteins required for specific DSB repair pathways we checked whether 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated larvae bearing mutations in genes encoding DSB repair master proteins (dATM dRad50 dNbs1 dMre11) HR-specific repair proteins required for resection or homology search and strand invasion (dRad51 Bloom) and NHEJ-specific proteins (ligase IV Ku70) elicited a decrease of CBs frequency after the challenging dose. The analysis of mitotic chromosomes from all mutants revealed no significant difference (p < 0.05) in the frequency of CBs between 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated and non-pretreated larvae indicating that the 0.4 Gy LDR-mediated resistance to γ-ray-induced CBs is strictly dependent on DNA repair genes (Fig. 2e).

We then verified whether 0.4 Gy LDR affects the kinetics of γH2Av recruitment to chromatin breaks. H2Av is the functional homolog of H2AX in Drosophila and its phosphorylation at Ser147 is induced by DSBs23. 0.4 Gy LDR -pretreated and non-pretreated larvae were exposed to 10 Gy γ rays and then checked by IF for the presence of γH2Av foci in larval neuroblasts (Fig. 3a) after 5 min 15 min 30 min and 60 min PIR. We found that in non-pretreated control larval brains the number of γH2Av foci/cell progressively increased over the time reached the highest peak (6 foci/cell) at 30 min PIR and started to slowly decrease at 60 min PIR (Fig. 3b). LDR -pretreated neuroblasts also showed a progressive increment of the γH2Av foci/cell frequency over the time with a peak at 30 min PIR. Interestingly the average of foci/cell at 30 min was around ~4 indicating that differently from non-pretreated controls LDR-pretreated brains accumulate less damage most likely as the results of either an accelerated DNA damage response or a more efficient DNA repair (Fig. 3b). We have also analyzed the kinetics of γH2Av accumulation by WB and found that consistently with our IF results at 30 min PIR γH2Av in 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated cells does not accumulate as robustly as in non-pretreated cells (Fig. 3cd; see Supplementary Fig. 5 for unprocessed blot images) confirming that 0.4 Gy LDR could accelerate the completion of the DNA damage response. We also analyzed the levels of the MRN complex as well as of Ku70 in both pretreated and non-pretreated cell extracts. WB analyses revealed a statistically significant increase of Rad50 and Nbs1 but not of Ku70 protein levels in 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated cells with respect to non-pretreated cells (Fig. 3e f; see Supplementary Fig. 6 for unprocessed blot images). Collectively these data along with the genetic analyses indicating a strict requirement of DNA repair genes suggest that the RAR relies on an efficient DNA damage response. However we cannot rule out the possibility that the LDR could also influence chromatin compaction making it more reluctant to damage or more accessible to DNA repair factors compared to non-pretreated chromatin.

LDR protects chromosomes from telomere dysfunction

We also asked whether other DNA damage-induced events are also affected by LDR. We focused on DNA damage response elicited by dysfunctional telomeres and verified the occurrence of telomere fusions (TFs) in mutants with a defective telomere capping. Depletion of either terminin complex components and/or terminin-associated factors induces the formation of multicentric linear and ring chromosomes very likely because of NHEJ-mediated fusion events that occur at uncapped telomeres2425 (for examples of TFs see Fig. 4a). We thus measured the frequency of TFs of 0.4 Gy LDR-pretreated mutants in selected genes coding for telomere capping proteins such as verrocchio (ver) and caravaggio (cav) that specify the terminin proteins VER and HP1-ORC-Associated Protein (HOAP) or Su(var)205 pendolino (peo) and effete (eff) that encode the non terminin protein Heterochromatin Protein 1a (HP1) Peo and UbcD1 respectively2425. As indicated in Fig. 4b we found that in all mutants analyzed 0.4 Gy LDR yielded a relevant reduction of TFs indicating that this exposure exerts a protective effect at uncapped chromosome ends. We have also analyzed the frequency of TFs caused by mutations in tefu nbs rad50 and mre11 genes encoding for the DNA repair factors ATM Nbs Rad50 and Mre11 respectively and which are also required for protecting telomeres from fusion events2627. Interestingly we found that the frequency of TFs in DNA repair mutants was indistinguishable from that of non-pretreated mutants (Fig. 4b) indicating that similarly to RAR the 0.4 Gy LDR-induced telomere protection depends on DNA repair factors. However the reduction of TFs did not always correlate with a reduction of γH2Av-positive Telomere Induced Foci (TIF) indicating that unlike chromosomal DSBs the reduction of fusigenic feature or uncapped telomeres does not have a direct effect on the cytological detection of telomere damage (Supplementary Fig. 7a b). We finally checked if LDR could induce an increase of retro-transposition of the telomeric retroelement HeT-A as it occurred in flies that were chronically exposed to sub-lethal doses of paraquat28. RT-qPCR analysis revealed no differences in the HeT-A expression between non-pretreated and 0.4 Gy LDR treated TF mutants (Supplementary Fig. 7c) indicating that the 0.4 Gy LDR protective effect on uncapped telomeres is unlikely due to an adaptive role of telomere elongation against the loss of capping.

Differential gene expression and genetic analyses reveal loquacious (Loqs) as a RAR responsive factor

To assess whether the 0.4 Gy LDR RAR was accompanied by differential modulation of specific set of genes we performed a genome wide RNA-seq analysis of total RNAs extracted from unirradiated (NT) 10Gy- 0.4 Gy LDR- and 0.4 Gy LDR + 10Gy-irradiated larval male brains. We decided to focus our transcriptomic analyses on males to avoid the confounding effects of gene expression variability of females which is known to be affected by dietary conditions during development and associated to investment into reproduction-related processes2930. To search for gene functions specifically associated to the chromosome break phenotype RNAs of 10Gy- and 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy irradiated larvae were extracted from brains dissected after 4 h following the acute dose exposure. Pairwise comparisons revealed that the 0.4 Gy LDR treatment per se has not determined a statistically significant modulation of general levels of transcripts compared to the unirradiated condition. In contrast both 10Gy- and 0.4 Gy LDR + 10Gy-treatments yielded a moderate yet statistically significant modulation of transcription in all comparisons (see Supplementary Data 1–5 for a list of both upregulated and downregulated genes). The Venn diagram including all differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy vs. 10 Gy 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy vs. 0.4 Gy LDR and 10 Gy vs. 0.4 Gy LDR comparisons has shown only a small number of genes in common among all comparisons (Fig. 5a). To further identify genes potentially involved in the RAR we focused on the set of DEGs found in the 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy vs. 10 Gy comparison. DAVID functional enrichment analysis (EASE score < 0.05 Adjusted p < 0.05) revealed that the DEGs from this comparison are involved in RNA processing (see Heat Map of Fig. 5b; Supplementary Data 6). 3 genes (l(3)72Ab CG5205 and CG8064) were also differentially expressed in the 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy vs 0.4 Gy LDR comparison.

Among these unique genes we have drawn our attention to the modulation of loqs (loquacious) transcripts that encode the dsRNA binding protein Loqs which is required for siRNA and micro-RNA biogenesis and that is the fly homolog of mammal TRBP3132. Four different transcripts have been identified for loqs (loqs-RA loqs-RB loqs-RC and loqs-RD) that give rise to the Loqs-PA Loqs-PB Loqs -PC and Loqs –PD isoforms respectively. Loqs PA and Loqs PB both harbor three dsRBDs (L1 L2 L3) while Loqs PC and PD both lack the third dsRBD and instead have short aa stretches at their C-termini. Loqs-PA and Loqs-PB interact with Dcr-1 during miRNA biogenesis32333435. Loqs-PC is rarely expressed and has no known function32 while Loqs-PD facilitates Dcr-2–dependent endosiRNA biogenesis3233. Our RNA-Seq experiment showed that the loqs-RD (but not the other transcripts) appeared ~2 fold decreased in 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy samples compared to 10 Gy irradiated samples. This reduction was also validated by RT-qPCR on three independent RNA extractions (Fig. 6a) suggesting that LDR could specifically influence Loqs-dependent esi-RNA biogenesis. Consistent with this we found that 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy larvae showed a statistically significant increase of mus308 transcripts that are the endogenous targets of esi-1 RNA36 with respect to both unirradiated and 10 Gy irradiated larvae (Fig. 6a).

Loqs-RD (but not -RB -RA and -RE) transcripts are downregulated in 0.4 Gy LDR exposed male brains following the exposure to 10 Gy while mus308 transcripts are upregulated.

To further understand whether the reduction of Loqs indeed accounts for the RAR we analyzed chromosome integrity in chronically irradiated Loqs-depleted larval brain cells with and without the 0.4 Gy LDR-treatment. We thus measured the frequencies of CBs in the loqsKO null mutant upon 0.4 Gy LDR 10 Gy and 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy treatments as well as in unirradiated loqsKO brains using the same experimental set up described above. Intriguingly we found that while unirradiated loqsKO larval brain cells exhibited very rare CBs the frequency of CBs in this mutant was >50% reduced with respect to Or-R control larvae (n = 250) after the exposure to 10 Gy (Fig. 6d). This suggests that the depletion of Loqs could mimic the effect of the 0.4 Gy LDR priming dose in determining resistance to ionizing radiation-induced CBs. Interestingly we observed that this response was lost when Loqs-PD but not –PB was expressed in the loqsKO null mutant (Fig. 6d) confirming that only the reduction of this specific isoform is involved in triggering radio-resistance to CBs. However we observed that the >50% reduction of CB frequency in 10 Gy irradiated loqsKO null mutant did not further decrease upon the 0.4 Gy LDR pretreatment suggesting that the effect of Loqs loss on the radio-resistance is epistatic over the 0.4 Gy (2.5mGy/h) LDR priming dose (Fig. 6d). Finally we observed a ~50% reduction of CBs also in loqsKO/+ heterozygotes suggesting that radioresistance effect is dominant and confirming our RNA-seq data that even a moderate downregulation of this gene can account for the protection against extensive DNA breakage.

To confirm that the loss of Loqs mirrors the effects of the 0.4 Gy LDR -induced radio-resistance we first verified whether the response to CBs in Loqs-depleted cells is also dependent on DNA repair factors. We thus sought to analyze CB frequency in loqsKO; tefuatm and loqsKO; nbs1 double mutants. While loqsKO; tefuatm double mutants turned out to be early lethal thus preventing us for a further characterization we found that the frequency of CBs in 2 Gy irradiated loqsKO; nbs1 larvae was similar to that of 2 Gy irradiated nbs1 single mutants (Supplementary Table 2) confirming that the protection from chromosome breakage in Loqs-depleted and 0.4 Gy LDR cells requires shared DNA protein factors. Finally we observed that the kinetics of γH2Av recruitment and the response to production of ROS in loqsKO and in 0.4 Gy LDR + 10 Gy cells were similar (Fig. 6e; Supplementary Fig. 4). Altogether this set of evidences confirms that repression of Loqs explains the LDR-mediated RAR and endorses the view that Loqs-PD is a bona fide low dose responsive gene.

Loss of Loqs reduces the frequency of Telomere Fusions in Drosophila telomere capping mutants

We then sought to verify if a reduction of Loqs similarly to LDR affects the fusigenic ability of chromosomes with defective telomere capping. We thus checked the frequency of TFs in double mutant combinations between loqsKO and TF mutants (ver1 cav1 nbs1) mapping on the third chromosome and therefore more suitable for recombination with loqsKO located on the second chromosome. Very interestingly we found that in loqsKO; ver1 and loqsKO; cav1 mutant combinations the percentage of TFs/cell was substantially lower than that observed in the corresponding controls while as expected TF frequency of nbs1 mutants was not affected by loss of Loqs (Fig. 6f). This finding further confirms that similarly to RAR the reduction of Loqs is also involved in the protection of uncapped telomeres.",,,,,,,,,

I’m at Burning Man and I feel like a kid again. The reason for this transmission is to tell you why.

Black Rock City a sprawling sandbox of stimuli on a planet called playa is a place entirely new to me but the inhabitants here say the only way to explore it is by bicycle.

The bicycle they told me is the main mode of transportation at Burning Man this planet’s yearly gathering of 80000 burners from far-flung corners of Earth a land much different than this one.

Here the people live in large camps named for the natures intentions and imaginations of the inhabitants there. There’s Run Free where the burners are clean and sober and find ways to explore Black Rock City without substances that turn the world into a lysergic candy-colored dreamscape. There’s Dustfish where desert angels sing of acid and hot springs. And among hundreds of others there’s Journeylizm a camp of artists scientists and journalists here to document another burn. They have adopted me. While I am here this is my home.

I have brought very little from my home planet to Black Rock City: Food water and camp gear to last 10 days in a hot dusty unforgiving place where people are not meant to live. But I have learned it is the red and cream cruiser with red and rainbow wheels that is most vital to experiencing this planet called playa.

The cruiser is not my own. It was loaned to me by Choco Taco the tough mamma burner who explored the playa long before me –– the burner without a name.

On my first night in Black Rock City I activated my red and rainbow wheels mounted the cruiser and pushed off into the dust.

What follows in the remainder of this transmission is a collection of lessons and discoveries I learned and documented atop a bicycle over the course of eight days at Burning Man.

Lesson One: Riding a bicycle in a dress is challenging

Where I come from men don’t wear dresses. And that’s unfortunate. I’m wearing one right now as I type this transmission and it is quite comfortable –– especially in a place like Black Rock City. There’s more room there’s more cover from the sun there’s no one judging you. And of course there’s that miraculous breeze that comes from under the bicycle when it seems you need it most.

But dear reader I must tell you: It is not easy riding a bicycle in a dress. The first night I wore one on the playa I failed to bunch up the fabric and pull it far enough over my knee to clear my leg over the seat and mount the bicycle. Down I went like a sack of hot garbage but I dusted myself off and tried again. Later I let the dress fall too low and soon the teeth of the sprocket bit into the fabric demanding a full stop wiggle and reset to get rolling. Dresses demand respect and practice –– well worth it to feel that breeze.

Lesson Two: Fast Travel

There is a time and place for exploring Black Rock City by foot. But for most travel situations the bicycle is ideal. During the day when temperatures shoot past the 90s and into the 100s the bicycle is vital. For one travel beneath the hard hot sun is faster. A journey that may take 20 minutes by bicycle may take over an hour by foot. Second this speedy travel grants access to analog air conditioning: The wind.

Lesson Three: Carrying Capacity

The first two nights on the playa were plagued by the worst dust storms at Burning Man in years. That made it necessary to pack the right equipment in case you ran into a dust devil with Dorothy still in it. Goggles to protect the eyes and a shawl to cover the mouth were part of my riding gear. Carrying all that on the body –– along with a camp cup lock notebook and water supply –– would be difficult without the aid of a basket. All that extra weight would cause further discomfort in an already uncomfortable environment.

Lesson Four: Exploration is enhanced

Exploring foreign lands is much more magical on a bicycle. That’s especially true at Burning Man. At sundown when burners howl to celebrate the coming of night the world takes on a carnival of the cosmos vibration. Flames explode into the sky. Vehicles shaped like pirate ships deep sea creatures and intergalactic monsters sail and swim and claw through dust that rapidly changes from a golden haze to a dense fog.

Under the metal bars of the Thunderdome burners compete in trapeze club battles while men and women in leather bark of violence and spectators hanging above make bets. In the dark of the playa rise up epic structures of light and sound. There is too much to see at Burning Man and there is no way to see it all. Well except one: Get on your bicycle find the 100-foot rocket tower ascend four sets of rickety ladders to the very top and look out at the psychedelic horizon. Somehow it will all seem smaller – conquerable. The sight produced in me a boost of bravery to climb down the ladders pull my dress far enough over my leg to mount the cruiser with ease and launch back into the mysterious expanse of the playa.

Lesson Five: Breakdowns are imminent

With each day that expires before the burn the playa dust gets thicker and thicker. Deep ruts and heavy bumps may eventually send the contents of your basket crashing to the dirt forcing you to dismount and collect. Late in the week breakdowns are more likely to happen. By then the dust has had many days to infiltrate every corner of your being –– several of those corners being unmentionable in this transmission.

On my eighth day in Black Rock City playa dust caked in the ball bearings of the cruiser’s chain ring and locked up the pedals. There are bicycle camps at Burning Man ready and available to help with repairs. But I had failed to bring my map that day and the closest suggestion of a passing burner was too far to walk in the 102-degree heat with a dwindling water supply. I walked back to camp. In the shade I knocked loose the caked dust by pounding the crank arms with the palm of my hand and gently bouncing the tires off the ground. With the chain ring teeth freed to bite the chain I slicked the bearings with WD-40 and cranked the wheels until the tires spun in a smooth whir.

Lesson Six: Bicycling with intentions to walk

An earlier portion of this transmission described the benefits of fast travel. But there are also advantages to securing the bicycle to a rack in a desirable location and setting off on foot. The benefits of slow travel have to do with discovery and connectivity. On a bicycle feeling like you have to get somewhere you may pass up the robot wheeling its way to camp. On foot you may shake that robot’s hand ask whether it knows Johnny 5 and get this response: “He’s not alive!”

On a bicycle the rattle of the basket and squeak of the chain may keep you from hearing the ethereal guitars of Miles Davis’ “In a Silent Way” on a night when the stars look so low you could pluck them out of the sky. On foot you may notice the 8-foot telescope beneath the rotating dome look into the eyepiece see the rings of Saturn craters of the moon.

Lesson Seven: You will be transported – somewhere

The red and cream cruiser with the red and rainbow wheels has a transporting effect. But not in the sense that it transports you from point A to point B and back again. The effect I’m talking about somehow transported me back in time. This time travel glitch did not alter the physical world around me but it without a doubt shifted the emotional realm within me.

Flying through the playa dust on the red and cream cruiser with the red and rainbow wheels I returned to a time of potent courage and discovery I had not experienced since I was a child on my home planet. On the cruiser wonder returned. Awe guided the direction of my handlebars. Curiosity compelled me to get lost. I realized I had no responsibility other than finding my own way.

This sandbox freedom reconnected me to a time long long ago when I pedaled my silver trick bike with gumball blue pegs down sidewalks illuminated streetlamp yellow imagining that –– if I could just pedal fast enough –– the fabric of that reality could tear and I could slip into a portal to a new reality of light and sound and color. And that feeling I discovered is what Burning Man on a bicycle is all about. Riding the red and cream cruiser dust trailing the red and rainbow wheels like rocket smoke I felt like a kid again –– like I could lift up and off the playa and through the dust and into the stars to a new galaxy far from the one I call home.

In it he explained why on that fine April day in 2022 he and 1200 other scientists all over the Earth would risk arrest to protest Chase the world’s biggest financier of climate-killing fossil fuels. (Citi and Bank of America are close behind.)

“We [scientists] have been telling you guys for so many decades that we’re headed towards fucking catastrophe” Kalmus said. The clip went viral probably in part because when Kalmus told the cameras (and waiting cops) that he was committing nonviolent civil disobedience “for my sons” he began to weep — and didn’t stop. Their protest he said brokenly was for “all of the kids of the world all of the young people all of the future people.”

Kalmus is one of thousands of parents worldwide organizing around a similar rallying cry: We love our children. We won’t let you wreck their world.

A couple decades ago there were few if any family-focused environmental organizations let alone the kind of parent-led climate justice groups now confronting polluters and the systems of racism colonialism patriarchy and extractive capitalism that enable them. In the U.S. Mothers Out Front began to organize in several states in 2013 and two years later mothers in some chapters of the climate action group 350.org launched subgroups centered around families and the parental imperative to protect children from harm.

Then in 2018 Greta Thunberg and her school strikes took the world by storm. Though some young people were already leveraging their moral authority in court to demand that adults stop trashing their future the Fridays For Future school strikes — and Thunberg herself — received spectacular media attention. They electrified the burgeoning global youth climate movement and inspired the offshoot group Parents For Future Global that now boasts hundreds of parent-led grassroots groups in 23 countries. (You can join the next global strike September 23.) Other mom-led groups have since sprung up worldwide including in the U.K. India Pakistan and Canada.

I asked four parent-focused organizers how one might begin to parent toward climate justice.

Brooklyn-based Chandra Bocci a fellow with the international parent-climate network Our Kids Climate and Parents For Future Global says that parenting toward climate justice is not about “a perfect zero-waste lifestyle.” Given humanity’s short time frame to slash emissions enough to keep warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius she advocates collective empowerment and action that’s targeted strategically. “Showing children that we have a window where we can do something — and that we are doing something — is so important.”

For Bocci and her preschooler that meant joining parents from Climate Families NYC at a 2021 protest in front of the home of Larry Fink CEO of BlackRock the world’s largest asset manager. BlackRock with its nearly $260 billion invested in coal oil and gas projects worldwide had long been a focus for Bocci and other parent climate organizers. When they learned that Fink lived near several of them they felt a responsibility to appeal directly to the father of three to use his outsize influence to divest BlackRock from climate destruction.

“I think that was only the second time he had talked in person with any activist group” Bocci said recalling that Fink came out to meet them. “Because of our position as parents with kids we have a different approach and a different kind of moral authority from other activists showing up. We keep very positive but we’re not scared either.”

Parents working in some conservative communities can face massive challenges on the climate justice front says Winona Bateman executive director of Missoula Montana-based Families For a Livable Climate (FLC). In Montana she says “we have folks trying to make voting more difficult for our tribal communities and Indigenous nations. There are definitely racist dog whistle political signals that get thrown around in our state. That’s a challenge because those are triggers for people.”

Bateman is not daunted. “The data around how people feel about climate change and the danger it presents to the world is pretty strongly in our favor” she says. “Even in Montana over 60 percent of people agree it’s happening and there’s strong support for corporate action and renewable energy as part of our future.”

To engage that 60 percent and “create community for climate action in Montana” (FLC’s stated mission) FLC offers education on creating zero-waste schools talking to kids about the climate crisis and moving from climate despair to action. Those ready for political action can petition utilities to transition to clean energy or support the kids taking the state of Montana to trial next year for violating their right to a clean and healthful environment.

But a predominant focus says Bateman is helping parents feel comfortable talking about climate justice with people across cultural and political divides: “People need space to shift and they can’t get there if no one can have a conversation with them about it. If you just yell at them they’re not going to be able to shift.”

On September 27 FLC will offer a virtual discussion with Katherine Hayhoe about her 2021 book Saving Us: A Climate Scientist’s Case for Hope and Healing in a Divided World. Hayhoe who has children is widely praised for helping climate advocates find common ground with a broad range of people based on shared values.

A challenge for several parent climate action groups including Bateman’s in Montana is that they’re sometimes made up of all or mostly white middle-class women. Bateman doesn’t shy from this fact or the daily work required to create a just and equitable future for everyone.

“We try to make sure we’re bringing lots of different perspectives and voices into the work we’re doing and to how we’re understanding things.” To deepen her own understanding Bateman a descendant of settlers in North Dakota took a “deep dive” into her own family tree. “My family settled along the Knife River of North Dakota; the lands of the Mandan Hidatsa and Arikara Nation (Three Affiliated Tribes).”

“The challenge for white people in the movement” she said “is to step up and engage folks who are not thinking about how climate is disproportionately impacting people of color and people of low income.”

Lorna Pelly based in British Columbia tries to raise kids who understand the world isn’t fair and contribute toward correcting injustices. In her work with For Our Kids (FOK) a network of over 20 active parent-led chapters across Canada she begins with recognizing that the climate crisis impacts people unequally. “It will always be the lower-income people or countries that are affected the most and have a harder time rebuilding after climate disasters” Pelly said. “I’ve never been able to sit well with that knowing that it’s the more developed countries causing [more of] the carbon emissions.”

FOK trains parents in “Curious Climate Conversations” and supports Wet’suwet’en Land Defenders Indigenous communities fighting Coastal Link Gas and its attempt to force a new pipeline through their unceded territory. Many parents have been shocked says Pelly to learn about the racism of Canada’s police force and FOK now offers workshops on raising anti-racist children. (You can join this September 17 workshop.)

For the growing number of parent groups in the Global South movement-building is both more urgent and more difficult organizers say.

“Parenting toward climate justice means something very different to us here in the Global South than it does to you in the North” says Amuche Nnabueze a Nigerian organizer with Parents For Future Global. “We are already suffering the effects of climate change in every aspect of our lives. There is so much poverty. We do not even have water clean water. There are droughts and floods. Rivers are drying up.”

During our interview the power went out twice plunging Nnabueze into darkness. Nigeria is well-known for its entrenched political corruption that makes it hard for citizens of the densely populated African nation to even discuss human rights or feel safe traveling to events in other cities for fear of kidnapping. Many people are hungry says Nnabueze and lack health insurance. All of this together can create indifference when she reaches out to parents through local organizations her academic and social circles and her church urging them to join for example the upcoming global climate strike on September 23.

“Poverty drives this indifference” Nnabueze says so she works to connect where she can spearheading advocacy campaigns and encouraging others to lifestyle changes such as reducing plastic consumption.

“Parents really connect to lifestyle changes so we talk about things they can do.” Climate advocacy in Nigeria can’t be only about climate strikes because she says with a laugh “we are not really sure what the government will do.”

Nnaueze’s three children join the parent-led events and her daughter 17 organizes Green Teens Africa which focuses on sustainable lifestyle skills. “We parents are supporting them through sharing our ancestral and Indigenous knowledge about growing crops subsistently waste management permaculture and more based on our Indigenous circular economy model.”

Nnabueze felt boosted by the year-long Parent Climate Fellowship that gave her training financial support and the opportunity to travel to Glasgow last year for COP26. It was powerful she said to join other climate organizers and bring her voice to the global stage.

Nnabueze continues to network with parent climate organizers worldwide informing the work of parents in the Global North through regular online meetings with international parent networks such as Our Kids Climate and Parents For Future Global.

She and many other Global South parent organizers are impacting groups in the Global North including all of those mentioned above who do their best to learn educate their members and then try to help in their own communities.

In her work with New York City parents Bocci tries to follow the lead of environmental justice-centered organizations. “We’re not reinventing the wheel. We’re really paying attention and reaching out and collaborating and partnering and following calls to action from BIPOC and working-class [groups] in our state” she said.

New York Renews a statewide coalition of over 300 grassroots groups centers environmental justice in their work and has developed a clear legislative agenda. “A lot of what we do is follow their lead and just jump on their campaigns and amplify them. Then we show up in support. We ask ‘How can we help?’”

But now in 2022 the four-bed semi-d has got an asking of price €100000 or 28% more than the same house sold for new in 2019.

Listed with a €449000 AMV is 1 Lakelands Gardens in the sold-out Crawford gate scheme of 65 homes in Cork’s Skehard/Blackrock/Mahon hinterland in ‘as new’ condition — “it’s the closest thing I’ve seen to a formal showhouse” says auctioneer Jeremy Murphy who’s acting for a Cork couple already set to trade up from their 1284 sq ft home.

The Price Register shows 60 listings at Crawford Gate including several multiples and No 1 shows at €349500 as a 2019 deal recorded in February 2020 making some €20000 over the original sale prices of three-bed semis there as a larger and four-bed home.

Today at the €449000 AMV it shows just how strong the market has been since — and how much harder it is for first-time buyers to afford to buy as the purchasing goalposts have moved steadily out of reach for so many.

If the same 28% rise in values is applied to the three-bed semi-ds in Crawford Gate another resale offer here could be expected to float at €415000 up €90000 from the three-bed originals’ €325000 sale price when new.

Just two Crawford Gate houses show to date at over €400000 Louisa Court at €405649 and No 13 Frederick Avenue at €402598 likely to be the largest 1450 sq ft types and both listed in 2020 in the scheme of 65 three-and four-bed homes off the Skehard Rd and Bessboro.

A mix of terraced and end/semi-detached homes which started on site in late 2018 Crawford Gate was done by DOB developments (a new generation headed by the O’Brien family of O’Brien and O’Flynn house-building tradition) on a 3.8-acre site. It was once home to one of Cork’s finest houses and estates Lakelands demolished 140 years ago and which was owned by the Crawford family. Their name lives on in the city centre as benefactors of the now-municipal art gallery and owners of the Beamish & Crawford brewery back in the day.

Now rapid price inflation during the past two years of the pandemic has seen unpredicted and frothy growth in the property market nationwide — close to 30% in the case of No 1 Lakelands Gardens if it sells for or above the asking price.

Not surprisingly it’s in walk-in order in a location served by two bus routes the 202 and the 215 and has the Blackrock Greenway running close by too with both Mahon’s retail and office parks as well as Blackrock village within a walk.

It has a front reception room rear kitchen/diner guest WC and utility and four compact first floor bedrooms (one with en suite shower room) and a main bathroom with shower over the bath.

The enclosed back garden has an Astroturf finish and BER-wise it’s A3 rated so will be easy to power and heat a bonus for buyers once they can afford the purchase price.

Buyers may have the option to rent a room or two for income support up to a current maximum of €14000 tax-free under the Rent a Room scheme. However first-time buyers will not be able to avail of the Help to Buy scheme or of the newly introduced Shared Equity Scheme as No 1 Lakelands Gardens is now a second-hand property.

VERDICT: Some 200 people mostly first-time buyers queued to inspect Crawford Gate houses in 2019 on their launch. The buyer catchment will be far smaller now given the rise in values and prices since.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJnai5jb20vc3RvcnkvbGlmZS9hcnRzL2J1cm5pbmctbWFuLzIwMjIvMDkvMDMvYnVybmluZy1tYW4tMjAyMi1lZmZpZ3ktc3RhdHVlLW5ldmFkYS1ibGFjay1yb2NrLWRlc2VydC83OTY1Njg1MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Check out how the Burning Man effigy has changed over the years,"After seven days of celebration and debauchery in the Black Rock Desert Burning Man 2022 will reach the much-anticipated igniting of the neon green effigy Saturday.

The ""Waking Dreams"" iteration of the Man will be the 37th burned since the very first in 1986 – including one virtual and one broadcast – and the wooden giant has gone through quite the evolution.

See how the Man has changed throughout the years:

1986

Theme: N/A

The very first Burning Man didn't take place in Black Rock City but rather in Baker Beach in San Francisco with a crowd of 35 that pales in comparison to today's tens of thousands of burners.

Yet standing at just 8 feet tall the fiery sculpture would make history.

1989

Theme: N/A

Over the course of three years the Man grew to 15 30 and 40 feet in 1989. As the statue grew so did the crowds as 300 watched it erupt in flames on Baker Beach.

It didn't go off without a hitch though as the Man's legs and pelvis snapped as it was assembled burning in a semi-awkward position.

2001

Theme: Seven Ages

Fifteen years later after the very first Burning Man the 2001 version is far past the event's humble beginnings. More than 25000 people were in attendance during the eight-day event in Black Rock City where Burning Man started calling home in 1990.

This Man stood at 40 feet boosted on a 30-foot platform called the ""Temple of Wisdom."" The body was outlined in blue neon with the inside green blue and purple neon on the head.

2010

Theme: Metropolis

Burning Man reached new heights in 2010 – literally as the Man stood tall at 40 feet on top of a 64-foot pavilion for a combined total of 104 feet the second highest in Burning Man history.

Over 51000 people came to be a part of the 2010 event the biggest crowd yet for Burning Man following a slight dip in attendance in 2009 following the nation's economic downturn.

2014

Theme: Caravansary

2014's Man is the tallest in the event's history tied with 2017's at 105 feet except this Man doesn't have a platform or podium to boost its height – it towers with its feet planted on the playa floor.

Nearly 66000 attended the burn a slight decrease from the year prior.

2019

Theme: Metamorphoses

The 2019 edition of Burning Man would be the last (official) in-person Man until 2022's.

2019's effigy may not have reached the heights of years prior standing at 61 feet but it still sported an intricate design. 2019 was the first year without Burning Man co-founder and designer Larry Harvey who died in 2018; carrying on the Burning Man tradition were Yelena Filipchuk and Serge Beaulieu who designed the Man Pavillion.

'Point of View': See Filipchuck and Beaulieu's work at Burning Man 2022

Just fewer than 79000 attended the largest population in Burning Man history by a few thousand.

2022

Theme: Waking Dreams

This year's Burning Man has a lot to live up to with nearly four decades of history. The time-honored tradition has evolved to towering heights attracted a city's worth of fans and endured the country's financial woes as well as a worldwide pandemic.

The past two years alone it experienced a virtual burning in 2020 and a broadcast one in 2021 as well as an unofficial gathering.

The clock is ticking until the Man meets its fiery fate Saturday night but for now it stands tall in the footsteps of the Men of the past.

This would mean that the smallest aircraft in the MAX family the MAX 7 would enter service before the largest variant the MAX 10 which is affected by certification issues with US regulators.

The Boeing 737 MAX 7 could be certified by the end of 2022 while the largest member of the aircraft family the MAX 10 could be certified in the first half of 2023 a Boeing spokesperson told Reuters earlier this week.

In March 2022 the US aviation regulator expressed concern that Boeing might miss the deadline to meet the regulatory directives by the end of 2022. If the aircraft is not certified by the Federal Aviation Administration by that time only the US Congress can extend the deadline.

In July 2022 Boeing chief executive Dave Calhoun warned that there was a risk the plane maker could cancel the MAX 10 program due to certification delays.

The Boeing 737 MAX 7 took off on its maiden flight in March 2018. The jet’s entry into service was initially scheduled with Southwest Airlines (LUV) for early 2019. However two fatal MAX crashes and the subsequent worldwide grounding of the jet have drastically altered that.

The Boeing 737 MAX 7 was seen taking off on a few trial flights earlier in 2022 and is currently expected to be cleared for operations by the US regulators by the end of the year.

The MAX 7 is the smallest member of Boeing’s upgraded narrow-body twin-engine jetliner range. In comparison to its predecessor the 737-700 MAX 7 fits two more seat rows accommodating 12 more seats and can carry up to 153 passengers in a two-class configuration with a maximum capacity of 172 seats.

The aircraft has a range of 3850 nautical miles (7130 km) which is the longest of all other 737 MAX Family aircraft. According to Boeing the shortened 737 aircraft is designed for flying at high altitudes and hot climates or on longer journeys than larger narrow-body jets."

Ferrari never sold this fellow in the United States due to its carbureted engine which didn’t comply with emission regulations. Come 1979 the Prancing Horse gifted the four-seat grand tourer with mechanical fuel injection thus giving birth to the 400i.

Offered through 1985 the 400i uses the renowned K-Jetronic system developed by German engineering and technology company Bosch. The first series-production car to feature K-Jetronic is the Porsche 911T and the 400i is Ferrari’s first-ever production car equipped with this technology.Named this way after the (nearly) 400 cubic centimeters of each cylinder the 400i displaces 4823 cubic centimeters. An evolution of the legendary V12 developed by Gioacchino Colombo in 1947 this lump is codenamed F101 D. At first glance the only difference over the F101 C in the 400 is a letter. On the other hand the D embodies all the changes that Maranello had to make with the adoption of Bosch K-Jetronic mechanical fuel injection.The distributors used by the carbureted 400 were replaced by a single unit and electronic ignition supplied by Magneti Marelli. Considering that Ferrari made the switch to fuel injection for more favorable emissions test results it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the F101 D isn’t as powerful as the F101 C. 311 ponies and 304 pound-foot (412 Nm) compared to 335 ponies and 347 pound-foot (471 Nm) is a tremendous difference no doubt about it!Just like the 400 the Prancing Horse’s first production car to be offered with a torque-converter automatic the 400i could be had with a five-speed manual and a three-speed automatic. As a result manuals were sold as the 400i GT and automatics were sold as the 400i A. Even though Ferrari says the automatic tranny is supplied by BorgWarner bear in mind that it's designed by General Motors. The automatic in question is the long-running TH400.Regardless of transmission the gran turismo is rocking a limited-slip differential a self-leveling rear axle power steering telescopic shocks from Koni coil springs unequal-length wishbones and two anti-roll bars. The Italian outfit also provided 15- by 7-inch Cromodora five-spoke alloys Michelin XWX rubber boots ventilated disc brakes and twin fuel tanks.The 2700-millimeter (106.3-inch) wheelbase was the longest of any production car from the Prancing Horse. By comparison the subsequent 456 and 612 boast 4600 mm (102.3 in) and 2950 mm (116.1 in) respectively. Unveiled in 1979 at the Turin Motor Show the most expensive Ferrari of that era uses the tubular steel frames of the 400 before it. The 400i is pretty similar in terms of exterior design too save for the redesigned taillights.Styled by Leonardo Fioravanti at Pininfarina the 400 series is mostly steel in terms of chassis and bodywork. The only exceptions are the aluminum hood and trunk lid. Pop-up headlights and branded mirror caps also need to be mentioned along with leather upholstery air conditioning a radio electric windows and a three-spoke steering wheel that frames a 300-kph speedo.The instrument cluster also consists of a tachometer that goes to 8000 rpm and two centrally-mounted gauges for the oil pressure and water temperature. Where the center console meets the dashboard the 400i presents you with a clock the fuel readout and oil temperature gauge.Tipping the scales at 1830 kilograms (4034 pounds) the fuel-injected sibling is obviously heavier than the 400 . In combination with the poorer output figures the additional weight took its toll on top speed. According to Ferrari the 400i tops 150 miles per hour (241 kilometers per hour) compared to 153 miles per hour (246 kilometers per hour) for the 400.As expected acceleration wasn’t particularly stellar either. Be that as it may zero-to-60 times aren’t of the essence. Enzo Ferrari used the 400i as his company car which speaks volumes about how the 400i is meant to be enjoyed. Famous owners also include Welsh actor Richard Burton Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham and Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman.Updated in time for the 1982 Paris Motor Show the 400i was never meant to sell like hot cakes. Enzo-era Ferrari was more into racing than sales volumes and the prohibitive price of the 400i didn’t help either. A grand total of 1305 units were produced through 1985 of which 833 were specified with the automatic transmission designed by General Motors.Despite its Bosch-sourced injection system the 400i was never sold in the United States on emissions and safety grounds. American dealers had to make do with the V8-powered 308 series. Nevertheless gray imports were in full bloom. The 400i was succeeded by the 412 which some peeps might recognize as the black-painted car from Daft Punk’s Electroma",,,,,,,,,,,,

An Arsenal of Weapons: The 49ers Have Quietly Become Even More Dangerous on Offense in 2024

By Don Atkinson 18 hrs

It's not a shock to anyone who looks back at the past two NFL seasons to contemplate that the San Francisco 49ers' offense has finally stepped out of the shadow cast by the team's ever-imposing defense. Since their 2019 Super Bowl run players like Nick Bosa Fred Warner Dre Greenlaw and former 49ers Richard Sherman and Jimmie Ward have garnered most of the attention when talking about the team. That was indeed the case until 2022 when future Hall-of-Fame running back Christian McCaffrey who came to San Francisco in a mid-season trade with the Carolina Panthers changed the conversation. The 49ers' offense was suddenly seen not just as a semi-capable complement to a sterling defense but rather as a unit that could put up some points and in a dramatic way.

It wasn’t much of a gamble.

Initially bets in the state were limited to $5 and casinos were not open 24/7. The idea behind the 1990 legalization was to boost tourism in old west communities. Instead analysts said Colorado’s casino customers spent a median amount that was far below the national average.

There was zero interest by Las Vegas or Reno casino operators to enter Colorado.

“The three gaming markets lacked quality assets” said JMP Securities gaming analyst Jordan Bender. “These are not the easiest markets to get to especially during the winter with snow and ice on the ground. The casinos were not ‘must go to’ destinations.”

Voters and Colorado casino supporters however didn’t give up.

Ballot questions in 2009 and 2020 increased and subsequently eliminated betting limits while adding gaming options normally found in Nevada casinos. Sports betting legalization in 2021 also helped make Colorado a market that gaming operators could no longer ignore.

Colorado's mountainous rural casino communities where an old west setting mixes with the 21st century and where only a few working gold mines still exist have turned the state into one of the top 15 gaming revenue-producing regions.

Macquarie Securities gaming analyst Chad Beynon said Colorado gaming has transitioned away from being an industry afterthought.

“The changes have been slow. We’ll see if the growth continues” he said.

Expansion from tiny storefront casinos to mid-sized resorts has been taking place over the last few years. In Black Hawk three properties account for more than 1300 hotel rooms roughly 85 percent of the total market. In Cripple Creek a 300-room hotel-casino that is being built by Las Vegas-based Full House Resorts will double the market size when it opens next year.

Las Vegas and Reno gaming companies committed millions of dollars to change the perception of the Colorado casino communities but also use the market as a way to draw new business especially from the population-rich Denver area to Nevada.

“This was an opportunity for us because Black Hawk didn't have a high-end property” Monarch Casinos CEO John Farahi said of his Reno-based company’s 2012 acquisition of the former Riviera Black Hawk. “For us this opened the market to attract more high-end clients.”

At the time of purchase the Riviera casino was 32000 square feet with 700 slot machines 12 table games and a buffet. The casino did not have any hotel rooms.

Ten years and $442 million later Monarch completed a total renovation of the renamed Monarch Casino Resort Spa Black Hawk that saw the casino double in size expand its number of slot machines and table games add a sportsbook and build a hotel tower that includes 516 rooms and suites a rooftop pool and spa and 5000 square feet of meeting space.

“We utilized every square inch of that property” Farahi said of the site that is the first casino encountered by visitors arriving from the Denver region along Highway 119.

Monarch which also operates the Atlantis in Reno does not break out total revenue and cash flow by property in its quarterly earnings. But Farahi said the Black Hawk casino is now the company’s flagship resort.

He said it would be a challenge for another casino operator to copy Monarch’s investment.

“I don't know if there is as much land for somebody to come and do something significant” Farahi said. “With the betting limits lifted we were able to expand the property and bring the high-end market to Black Hawk which is something you couldn’t do before.”

Truist Securities gaming analyst Barry Jonas said in a July research note that Monarch management indicated it was in the “second or third inning” of its strategy to attract big-spending players to Black Hawk. He said Monarch had more than 23 percent of the business in Black Hawk which he expects will increase.

“Market share accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2020 when the first hotel rooms and expanded casino came online” Jonas said. “The property is designed to attract higher-worth gamblers with a Vegas-esque experience.”

A Nevada influence in Black Hawk

In Black Hawk a mountain town 45 minutes west of Denver ownership changes reflect ties to multiple Nevada-based gaming companies.

In 2004 Las Vegas-based Ameristar Casinos bought the bankrupt Mountain High Casino and spent $80 million to renovate the property and change the name to Ameristar Black Hawk. The company spent $235 million to add a 536-room hotel tower in 2009 when gaming limits were first increased.

Ameristar is now owned by Penn Entertainment which operates M Resort in Henderson and two casinos in the northeastern Nevada community of Jackpot.

Prior to acquiring Caesars Entertainment in 2020 Reno-based Eldorado Resorts bought Isle of Capri Casinos in 2017 which included the 300-room Isle Casino Black Hawk. The property was rebranded last month as Horseshoe Casino Black Hawk.

Reno-based Jacobs Entertainment operates two Black Hawk casinos The Lodge and Gilpin Casino. Bally’s Corp. which is acquiring Tropicana Las Vegas took over three Black Hawk casinos formerly owned by Las Vegas-based Affinity Gaming in 2020. A year earlier Las Vegas-based Maverick Gaming bought a small Black Hawk casino and two Central City properties from a Colorado businessman.

The Grand Z Casino Hotel in Central City has been remodeled by a privately held company and Johnny Z’s Casino in Central City has been renamed and rebranded as the Dragon Tiger Casino an Asian-themed property.

Maverick CEO Eric Persson said the branding comes from Dragon Tiger Noodle Co. a business he co-owns with celebrity chef Jet Tila. He hopes to attract Asian business from Greater Denver to Central City.

“Having baccarat added to what we can offer customers opens everyone up to the Asian communities in Colorado” Persson said. “Getting rid of the betting limits and adding the games has expanded the market. You also have to credit Monarch because there weren’t a lot of rooms here. Anytime another place adds capacity it helps everybody.”

Beynon said casino operators used to view their properties as a way to pad customer portfolios with potential players from Denver.

But with the 10-county Denver region having a population of almost 3 million according to the most recent Census the market is too big to ignore. Beynon expects the Black Hawk casinos will market to residents of the wealthier Denver suburbs which weren’t a viable customer base until the operating structure changed.

“The goal is obviously to get those western Denver residents to change their perception of Black Hawk” Beynon said. “With the changes I feel like they could market to those customers in a different way. I think that’s important for Monarch in the way they run their business.”

Las Vegas and Reno casino operators also view Denver as a Nevada feeder market.

At Harry Reid International Airport the Denver International Airport fills the second-biggest number of seats both coming and going. Only Los Angeles International Airport has more. An airport spokesman expects that status will hold through the end of 2022.

At Reno-Tahoe International Airport Denver is the fourth leading destination for Northern Nevada behind Las Vegas Phoenix and Los Angeles.

Stifel Financial gaming analyst Jeffrey Stantial said Black Hawk “is a great market from a fundamentals perspective.” He noted that Denver was ranked as a top economy nationally for multiple years prior to the pandemic.

“Certainly the large-scale Monarch project is disruptive given Ameristar was previously the only high-end product in town” Stantial said. “Monarch’s growth thesis is more predicated on growing the VIP pool and overall market versus market share gains.”

No limits more games

Colorado gaming prospects improved in 2009 when voters elected to increase betting limits to $100 per wager. The casinos were also allowed to add craps and roulette to their lineup.

The game changer came 11 years later when Colorado voters overwhelmingly approved Amendment 77 which removed wagering limits and allowed casinos to begin offering several previously forbidden games such as baccarat keno and the big six wheel.

The market immediately shifted.

Colorado's gaming revenue topped $1.23 billion in 2021 the state’s highest single-year total and the 14th highest of all commercial gaming states according to the American Gaming Association.

Black Hawk and Central City casinos combined for $812 million of the total which made the area the 15th largest commercial gaming market in the U.S. last year finishing $100 million ahead of downtown Las Vegas.

Through June Colorado gaming revenue was $646 million up 15.1 percent for the first six months of 2022.

Sports betting added

In November 2019 Colorado voters narrowly approved Proposition DD which legalized both online sports betting and retail sportsbooks with the tax revenue being directed toward statewide water-related projects and obligations.

Since launching in May 2020 more than $7.6 billion has been wagered on sports through June with operators collecting revenue of $464.9 million. Colorado is practically an online monopoly with more than 98 percent of all wagers placed through mobile apps.

The regulations allow Colorado casinos to have sports betting deals with multiple companies. In June there were 44 online and retail sportsbooks.

“With its very low taxes and license fees and its liberal market access climate Colorado is arguably the most favorable online sports betting operating environment in the U.S.” said Eilers & Krejcik Gaming analyst Chris Krafcik who follows sports betting nationally.

He said Colorado has become “an ideal proving ground” for small sports betting brands with “disruptor-style ambitions” and a launchpad for newer companies. Krafcik also expects the state to see a turnover in sports betting operators.

“We think there is going to be a steady inflow of new supply in the coming years” he said.

Colorado’s structure has allowed smaller Nevada-based sports betting companies to chart a path outside the Silver State.

Maverick Gaming and Monarch Gaming operate their own sports wagering platforms in Colorado. Circa Sports which is owned by downtown Las Vegas casino owner Derek Stevens has an online sports betting agreement with Century Casinos for its Cripple Creek property.

SuperBook which is operated by the Westgate Las Vegas has both retail and online sports betting agreements with Jacobs Entertainment at The Lodge in Black Hawk.

All the major sports betting operators are in Colorado. Caesars Sportsbook is building a retail space inside the Horseshoe Black Hawk. Penn National Gaming brought one of its first Barstool Sports retail sportsbooks to Ameristar Black Hawk.

But the process created some unusual market access agreements.

Strip gaming giant MGM Resorts International which has casinos in eight states but not in Colorado has an online partnership with the Midnight Rose Casino in Cripple Creek one of three small storefront gambling halls operated by Colorado-based Triple Crown Casinos.

Bally’s Corp. attached its BallyBet online sportsbook to one of its Black Hawk casinos but signed online partnership agreements with DraftKings and FanDuel that are tied with its two other properties. A DraftKings sportsbook is inside Bally’s Black Hawk North.

Similar to most other states DraftKings BetMGM and FanDuel dominate the market with a combined 84 percent of the wagers and revenue.

Krafcik said Colorado’s sports betting environment is favorable to the large and small operators including international-based sports betting businesses looking to gain a foothold in the U.S.

“If you want to go head-to-head with one of the big three that's of course going to be very very challenging” Krafcik said. “If you're looking to proof-of-concept your product or showcase your capabilities in a U.S.-regulated environment then Colorado is an economical market in which to do so.”

Cripple Creek seeks a larger piece of the action

Cripple Creek which is located an hour west of Colorado Springs should see a boost in gaming revenue and visitation through the development of a $250 million casino-hotel by Full House and the transformation of an older casino into a Golden Nugget by billionaire Tilman Fertitta.

JMP’s Bender said Cripple Creek has not expanded like Black Hawk because it doesn’t draw business from Denver which has almost four times the population of Colorado Springs.

“This goes back to the market being underserved with a quality asset” Bender said.

Full House which has five casinos in four states acquired Bronco Billy’s Casino in Cripple Creek for $30 million in 2016 and immediately expanded by acquiring the adjacent storefronts along East Bennett Avenue.

The investment set up competition across the street with Century Casinos which combined several storefronts into one casino and Colorado-based Triple Crown Casinos which has three storefront properties – The Brass Ass Midnight Rose and McGill’s.

Full House owns 17 of the 20 storefronts on its side of Bennett Avenue and would have owned the other three except Triple Crown wouldn’t sell the locations.

“They didn’t want us to have a monopoly on the street” said Bronco Billy’s General Manager Baxter Lee who came to Cripple Creek from Full House’s Silver Slipper Casino in Bay St. Louis Mississippi when company CEO Dan Lee (no relation) asked him to make the move.

The main reason for the switch was to help watch over the development of Chamonix Casino Hotel which features a theme resembling Chamonix-Mont Blanc the French alpine resort and site of the first Winter Olympics in 1924.

The property’s planned 300 hotel rooms would more than double Cripple Creek’s current hotel capacity. Chamonix will have an expanded gaming area restaurants meeting and convention space that can accommodate concerts and other entertainment a rooftop pool a spa and a 300-space parking garage.

Baxter Lee pointed toward an empty space at the front entrance where a jewelry store specializing in gold that pays homage to Cripple Creek’s mining legacy will be built. Chamonix is expected to open next year. He noted that many of Bronco Billy’s storefront units are not currently casinos and are being used by companies involved in Chamonix’s construction. One unit has model hotel rooms for Chamonix.

During Full House’s second-quarter earnings call Dan Lee said Cripple Creek’s status as a historic district prohibited the company from building a large high-rise hotel.

“But we get to a significant size by sprawling out” he said explaining that the project took over former parking lots and other vacant land parcels.

“Full House is trying to put together a very nice asset which the market lacks in a much smaller encashment area” Bender said. “From a market perceptive this will drive more people into Cripple Creek benefitting other operators like Century.”

Stantial said it will be incumbent on Full House to increase consumer awareness of Cripple Creek’s transformation into a regional-destination market.

Cripple Creek could soon have another player in the market in Fertitta whose Houston-based company owns Golden Nugget casinos in Las Vegas; Laughlin; Biloxi Mississippi; Lake Charles Louisiana; and Atlantic City.

In April a $43 million deal for the Wildwood Casino and Hotel was announced. Fertitta said the property which is currently the largest casino in Cripple Creek with 528 slot machines and 12 table games and the largest hotel with 100 rooms would be renamed and branded as a Golden Nugget.

“Golden Nugget entering is a small positive” Bender said. “The property itself is pretty small but to have a brand like that come in could draw interest.”

Stantial said Fertitta would not have made the investment if he wasn’t convinced Cripple Creek could support two higher-end properties.

“I see it as a nice vote of confidence. Golden Nugget is a seasoned operator and clearly sees merits to the growth thesis for Cripple Creek” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2xhcy12ZWdhcy1jYXNpbm8tY2xvc2luZy1hbm90aGVyLXdpbGwtdGFrZS1pdHMtcGxhY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las Vegas Casino Closing Another Will Take Its Place,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/las-vegas-casino-closing-another-will-take-its-place on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2xhcy12ZWdhcy1jYXNpbm8tY2xvc2luZy1hbm90aGVyLXdpbGwtdGFrZS1pdHMtcGxhY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd29ibS5jb20vZXhjaXRpbmctdGhpbmdzLWhhcHBlbmluZy1hdC10aGUtbWFudG9sb2tpbmctcm9hZC1hbGVob3VzZS1pbi1icmljay1uai_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exciting Things Happening at Mantoloking Road Alehouse in Brick,"Cozy upbeat tavern with a wraparound bar & TVs serving an ample menu of bar bites & burgers ~ Google Maps

Mantoloking Road Alehouse also is celebrating its grand ""reopening"". So it's a great time to head over and check out the newly renovated outdoor dining. There is also a big event coming up on Saturday September 10th.

Actor and now ""brewing"" businessman Kelsey Grammer will be appearing at the Mantoloking Road Alehouse next Saturday September 10th. Kelsey began Faith American Brewing Company in 2015 and is in Ocean County to share his experience and taste of his three beers. Faith American Ale IPA and Blue.

Kelsey Grammer will appear at Mantoloking Road Alehouse from Noon to 1:30 pm on Saturday September 10th. Should be a fun day and a great experience.

Swing by the Mantoloking Alehouse and celebrate their grand ""re-opening"" and enjoy either their lunch or dinner specials. Of course they are excited now that their outdoor dining renovations are done and you can swing by for a fantastic experience outdoors at a great time of year to enjoy fresh air cooler temps and sunshine.

This James Bond Movie Is the One You Should Watch Right Now,"The latest James Bond movie No Time to Die has an ending unlike that of any other Bond movie that came before it. The film wrapped up Daniel Craig's days as 007 and now speculation is running hot about what lies ahead for the franchise built around Ian Fleming's superspy -- including who'll be the next James Bond. To have an idea where we're going you'll want to know how we got here.

You may hear No Time to Die referred to as Bond 25 but that's not quite the whole story. It's the 25th installment in the Bond franchise from Eon Productions which dates all the way back to 1962 and the debut of Dr. No a modestly budgeted film that proved a hit and launched Sean Connery in a career-defining role. But there are also two other unofficial Bond movies -- one of them starring Connery himself. (Plot twists aren't limited to the individual film scripts you know.) So that's 27 in total.

It's a lot to dig into. The James Bond movie franchise is a pop culture institution featuring one of the most indelible movie characters of all time -- a suave stylish secret agent played by six different actors -- as well as spectacular stunts gorgeous locales and arguably the best movie theme music ever. Even if you've never seen a Bond movie you probably know something about 007: the timeless pose (man in tux pistol in hand) the cocktail catchphrase (""vodka martini shaken not stirred"") Blofeld the Bond villain famously lampooned as Dr. Evil.

Over the years there have been serious phases and silly phases and Pierce Brosnan gives you a very different Bond from Connery Craig or Roger Moore. I got started watching back in the Connery era so I'm forever um bonded to those movies. But for contemporary audiences I'm going with a different recommendation for which Bond movie to watch first and where to go from there.

Start with Daniel Craig in Casino Royale

Daniel Craig's first outing as James Bond is a terrific spy/action movie period. It's heart-poundingly good. But Casino Royale (2006) also did what no previous Bond movie could do: It completely rebooted the franchise blowing up a formula that many saw as played out with far-fetched gimmicks and belabored puns even as it remained a steady box office draw. It's based on Ian Fleming's very first Bond novel and gives us Bond very much as he was introduced to the world. It stays true to that original story in many essential ways (not a hallmark of Bond movies in general) while at the same time updating it for modern audiences attuned to the Jason Bourne and Mission: Impossible movies.

Craig himself delivers all the muscle and menace the character deserves in keeping with Fleming's depictions and as measured against Connery still the standard by which all other Bonds are invariably judged. There's nothing glib about this Bond and if he does look good in a tuxedo you always know there's a brute inside ready to battle the baddies. You learn right off the bat how he earned his double-0 (license to kill) rating then it's off to a spectacular chase and gunfight. That's just in the first 18 minutes.

High points too for a nasty villain in Mads Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre Judi Dench as Bond's no-nonsense boss M and Eva Green as Bond's female foil.

Casino Royale also opens the door to the strong series of movies that follow: Quantum of Solace (2008) Skyfall (2012) and Spectre (2015) and No Time to Die (2021) which CNET's Rich Trenholm in his review calls an ""epic explosive and emotional swan song."" There's more than just action across the five-film run: There's an arc that leads us deeper into Bond's past and how it drives him in the present day.

Next: From Russia With Love / Goldfinger

This whole franchise got going with Connery so you can't go wrong starting there. But for now let's skip the very first movie Dr. No. Not that there's anything wrong with it but the two movies that followed are more definitive — they're often the top two in lists of the best Bond movies. Pick either of these and you're getting absolutely top-shelf Connery the man who defined Bond and who was the heart of the franchise when it exploded into a phenomenon.

From Russia With Love (1963) gives you an honest-to-goodness old-fashioned spy story with no tech wizardry to speak of and no evil plan to destroy the world. It's Bond on an intimate scale a character-driven tale of our spy the woman sent to seduce him and the assassin (a buff and square-jawed Robert Shaw) assigned to take him down. (It also gives us our first glimpse of Blofeld the recurring uber-villain.) In the finest Bondian tradition of exotic locales this one cozies up to Istanbul and takes a memorable ride on the Orient Express. The fight scene in the train compartment is rightfully a classic.

Sean Connery seems to be enjoying himself. Why not when you can drive the iconic 1964 Aston Martin DB5 his co-star in Goldfinger. Getty Images

Then along came Goldfinger (1964) the third movie. This one ratcheted things up and pretty much set the splashy tone for all the movies up till Craig arrived — the outlandish plot (set off a nuke to irradiate the gold at Fort Knox) the over-the-top villain and henchman the Aston Martin DB-5 sports car tricked out with machine guns and ejector seat the laser with which Goldfinger memorably threatens 007 (""No Mr. Bond. I expect you to die""). Plus: One of the greatest theme songs of the series.

Connery is dashing virile devilish supremely confident — everything you'd expect from a modern action hero in part because he was the template.

James Bond: The deep cuts



I'd recommend getting a handful of Craig and/or Connery movies under your belt before venturing out more widely. Best to watch the Craig installments in sequence but the Connerys (like the Moores Daltons and Brosnans) you can watch in any order. Stick with the five Connery films from the 1960s before looking toward his two comeback efforts. The early movies are very much of their time of course so while you might chuckle at the quaintness of the tech the fashions and the cinematography you may cringe at some of the ethnic depictions and sexual mores.

The four other Bonds



Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan are the two horses besides Connery and Craig. Moore brought a lighter touch to Bond over the course of seven films throughout the 1970s and halfway into the 1980s. They're mostly romps really never too dark and often veering into the downright silly with ever more outlandish stunts and situations — he even makes it into space in 1979's Moonraker at the start of the space shuttle era. A good Moore vehicle to start with is For Your Eyes Only (1981) which is one of the more grounded stories from his run.

Brosnan picked up the baton in the mid-1990s and starred in four films. More muscular than the Moore movies they continued the tradition of ultra-spectacular stunts and groaner puns. It was steady work and enduring box office appeal if not quite at peak levels. Your best bet: Goldeneye (1995) Brosnan's first outing.

More in the footnote category are Timothy Dalton and George Lazenby. Dalton made two movies in the late 1980s and it was a bit of a grim turn. Flip a coin but hope that it turns up The Living Daylights. For a more intriguing entry try Lazenby's one go at it On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) the producers' first stab at casting a different actor as 007. It's the one in which Bond gets married -- to Diana Rigg no less.

What lies ahead for 007

Right now it's a waiting game. Despite the intense sense of closure in the finale of No Time to Die the movie credits closed with the upbeat declaration that ""James Bond will return."" That's it for now. Eon Productions hasn't set any timetable for either naming the next Bond actor or announcing a title for the next movie or anything. ""We'll figure that one out"" Barbara Broccoli longtime 007 producer told Deadline in December.

Will we see more than just a blockbuster movie every few years? Now that Amazon owns MGM home of the Bond catalog will Bond branch out into a Prime Video television series? Eon and Amazon are holding their cards close to their chest. In December in a profile article in The Hollywood Reporter Broccoli was less than definitive: ""As far as we know [Bond 26] will be an MGM film under an Amazon banner.""

But also: ""We make theatrical films and go to great pains to make them as cinematic as possible"" she said. ""I think that's what we intend to do but things change so who knows? Down the road it may be different.""

The next James Bond

That's the bajillion-dollar question and the oddsmakers have kept busy ranking the contenders for the next James Bond including longtime fan favorite possibilities like Idris Elba and Tom Hardy. But look let's be realistic. A good run for a Bond actor is about 10 to 15 years and as Ian Fleming originally drew up the character Bond starts out in his early to mid 30s. Elba is 49 already and Hardy is 44. Both would be in their 50s for all or a good portion of a 007 career.

There are plenty of 30-somethings to consider from Henry Cavill to Regé-Jean Page Richard Madden James Lowden and Dev Patel. Don't bet on Tom Holland much as the 25-year-old Spider-Man star might want it. And what about Lashana Lynch who briefly held the title of 007 in No Time to Die? That seems unlikely.

""I think it will be a man because I don't think a woman should play James Bond"" Broccoli said in that Hollywood Reporter feature adding that it's better to create roles specifically for women. But otherwise she indicated diversity is a consideration in casting the next Bond. ""He should be British so British can be any [ethnicity or race].""

James Bond movies in chronological order



In the official Bond canon — the films made by Eon Productions starting with Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli and continuing with others in the Broccoli clan — there are 25 films. Because of licensing issues there were two other non-canonical movies including (confusingly) one starring Connery for a grand total of 27.

Sean Connery

David Niven et al.



Casino Royale (1967) -- noncanonical (see below)

George Lazenby

Roger Moore

Timothy Dalton

Pierce Brosnan

Daniel Craig

Fun fact: Casino Royale has been filmed 3 times

There have been three versions of Casino Royale all radically different. We've already gone over the Daniel Craig version a strong contender for best and most definitive Bond movie ever.

Don't confuse it with the 1967 version of Casino Royale that's both a spoof and a god-awful big-budget mess of a movie. It's an odd blend of Bondian motifs old-time Hollywood stars and then-trendy psychedelia. The plot such as it is involves trying to fool the bad guys with a number of different people claiming to be James Bond including David Niven (the real Bond) Peter Sellers Woody Allen and former ""Bond Girl"" Ursula Andress.

Then there's the true footnote and totally not a Bond movie the 1954 adaptation of Casino Royale for an American TV anthology series called Climax! It's a roughly 52-minute episode in which American actor Barry Nelson plays the hero as ""Card Sense Jimmy Bond"" an agent for the ""Combined Intelligence Agency"" whose delivery tends toward watered-down Sam Spade. The highlight: Peter Lorre plays the villain a sad-eyed and shopworn Le Chiffre.

Laughing matters: The James Bond spoofs

Once you've seen a few Bonds especially the ones from the Connery and Moore eras you'll have a rich lode of references for the many many Bond spoofs over the decades.

How powerful a hold has Bond had on the Hollywood imagination? It brought Mike Myers to the peak of his fame with the Austin Powers movies which got started in 1997 but drew heavily on the '60s and '70s Bonds. The first Johnny English movie with a comically inept Rowan Atkinson didn't come till 2003. You'll find homages to Bond in everything from the Kingsman franchise to the Despicable Me movies (especially the first one) to 2019's Spies in Disguise an animated comedy with Will Smith as a tuxedo-wearing gadget-equipped secret agent (who gets turned into a pigeon).

For a deeper album cut look out for a pair of movies from the 1960s — Our Man Flint and In Like Flint — in which James Coburn gives a goofy-brilliant turn as a very Bond-like secret agent. That era brought a whole host of TV shows that very entertainingly mined the same soil — The Man From UNCLE Get Smart I Spy The Wild Wild West — and then served as fodder for movie reboots in more recent years.

Even Arnold Schwarzenegger got into the game in the James Cameron-directed True Lies (1994).

Literary matters: The James Bond books

James Bond got his start in a series of novels by Ian Fleming — 12 of them plus a smattering of short stories. The first novel Casino Royale came out in 1953 less than a decade after the end of World War II during which Fleming gained first-hand knowledge of spies and spying. It's worth picking up one or two of the books if only for the comparison with the movies which diverge anywhere between a little and ""lose everything but the title.""

Try Casino Royale for sure or maybe From Russia With Love (President Kennedy famously was a fan) or On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Note: The books are all a lot less flashy than the films and they're of a very different era the last ones having been written by about the time Goldfinger (movie No. 3) was hitting the screen.

There have also been Bond books written by other authors. Kingsley Amis kicked things off in 1968 with Colonel Sun and was followed by writers including John Gardner and Sebastian Faulks.

Little did you suspect but Fleming also wrote the children's novel Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang.

Ian Fleming's Bond books in chronological order:

Casino Royale (1953)

Live and Let Die (1954)

Moonraker (1955)

Diamonds Are Forever (1956)

From Russia With Love (1957)

Dr. No (1958)

Goldfinger (1959)

For Your Eyes Only (1960) -- collection of short stories including the title story Quantum of Solace and From a View to a Kill

Thunderball (1961)

The Spy Who Loved Me (1962)

On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1963)

You Only Live Twice (1964)

The Man With the Golden Gun (1965)

Octopussy and The Living Daylights (1966) -- those two short stories and in later editions two others

Bonus movie: The documentary



The Hulu original documentary Becoming Bond is a quirky and absolutely fascinating biopic about George Lazenby who came out of nowhere to become the man who took over for Sean Connery. You get a good look at how On Her Majesty's Secret Service fits into the franchise but more than that a riveting picture of Lazenby himself through sometimes truly moving reminiscences of a 70-something Lazenby and through reenactments of his early years that have something of a Drunk History vibe."

They are celebrating the 125th birthday of condensed soup.

Condensed soup was a big breakthrough in helping homemakers serve up a great meal. One can of condensed soup with water or milk added depending on the soup would yield 2 or 3 servings of soup as opposed to a single serving can of soup.

Condensed soup is a cost-efficient space-saving meal alternative and its long success rate of 125 years on your grocery shelves still remains a staple on dinner tables across the world.

The Campbell's Soup Co. was started by Joseph Campbell who was a fruit merchant from Bridgeton New Jersey and Abraham Anderson who was an icebox maker from South Jersey. They opened their first plant in Camden New Jersey in 1869.

Anderson would leave the company and John Dorrance an MIT graduate working at Campbell’s for $7.50 a week as a chemist developed a condensed soup tomato which changed the food industry. It was his invention in 1897 of condensed soup that led to Campbell’s Soup becoming so successful. Dorrance would later become president of the company after a buyout of the Campbell family.

Condensed soups are still used in many recipes and continue to be a strong product for revenue for Campbell’s. In 2021 Campbell’s had close to $8.5 billion in revenue.

Cream of mushroom the classic tomato soup and cream of chicken are big sellers for Campbell’s. I have used condensed soups in a recipe or two and the results are always good.

The next time you reach for a condensed can of soup thank our New Jersey company Campbell’s for making a tasty addition to your table.

In 1962 Andy Warhol would forever enshrine an avatar of everyday Americana as a lasting icon of modern culture. His serial work Campbell's Soup Cans made its debut a series of 32 canvases each devoted to a different variety of the ubiquitous canned soup. Those screen-printed paintings put the emerging Pop Art movement on the map displaying the artist’s nonchalance about what subjects were fit for artistic glory. (The now-priceless canvases first exhibited by Los Angeles gallerist Irving Blum are now part of MoMA’s permanent collection but Eli Broad paid $11 million in 2006 for a later single soup can painting.)

But that all came later. As the seemingly guileless Warhol explained his choice at the time Campbell’s soup was simply what he ate for lunch every single day.

However the same year that Warhol unveiled his seminal Pop Art pieces — his paean to the ordinary the corporate ideal of American mass-production — came the beginnings of a counter-revolution in how the country would regard food on their tables. This time the medium was not the gallery wall; it was televised.

MODERN CHOICE From Andy Warhol’s Campbell's Soup I Portfolio  1968 ( Artsy.net )

In 1962 one of the authors of the just-published Mastering the Art of French Cooking turned up on Boston public television show I’ve Been Reading and astonished the grumpy book-reviewing host by turning out a perfectly made omelet with a hot plate giant whisk and a few eggs she brought along. Afterwards dozens of viewers wrote to WGBH wanting more. After three pilots Julia Child made her series debut in The French Chef in 1963.

Child would have turned 110 this month (hat tip to Lane Doss’ Broken Palette newsletter for the reminder and this summary):

“In an era that embraced the modernity of frozen TV dinners and instant Jell-O Child reminded people that the act of cooking for someone is also an act of love. She also taught American housewives — and later everyone else that cooking need not be a chore — it can be a creative outlet and a source of great pride.”

Child’s initial series ran 10 years winning the first Emmy for an educational program and a Peabody. With almost 20 books and countless series she didn’t put down her whisk until age 85 after her last program in 1998 Julia Child & Jacques Pépin: Cooking at Home. A towering cultural figure literally (at six-foot-two) she was lampooned by Dan Aykroyd in an unforgettable 1978 Saturday Night Live skit. Julia was so tickled that she used to play a videotape of the segment for her dinner guests shouting “Save the liver!”

JUST THE APPETIZER

Today we have a food-stuffed television landscape including a whole cable channel devoted to cooking star TV chefs and even just food-adjacent stars.

Meryl Streep earned one of her multitude of Oscar nominations for her portrayal of Child in the 2009 Julie and Julia. Today Child who died in 2004 is the subject of an HBO Max narrative series Julia starring British actor Sarah Lancashire now readying its second season.

Considered unscripted TV’s fastest-growing sub-genre a sample of today’s food TV includes also on HBO Max Selena Gomez’s popular Selena + Chef (with a parade of bold-face-name chef guests like Marcus Samuelsson Roy Choi José Andrés and Rachel Ray); Bravo’s Top Chef (now filming its 13th season in London) and its imitators; and Netflix’s The Great British Baking Show which just announced an American iteration produced by Roku with Ellie Kemper and Zach Cherry. Scripted food drama is also proving delectable: this summer’s unsettling The Bear gave Hulu an edgy talker and the upcoming black comedy horror film The Menu starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Nicholas Hoult fending off a scary chef played by Ralph Fiennes is premiering at the Toronto Film Festival.

It’s a smorgasbord fragmented from Child’s singular vision into a hundred directions. But food and its subsequent TV programming is more than ever proxy for our larger cultural conversations.

And in the context of the entertainment industry’s sweeping changes — where Warner Bros. and Discovery two companies with distinct identities are in the throes of an arranged marriage — it seemed a moment to examine the culture of what today’s food TV reflects about the times.

THREE DEFINING WOMEN

In the '60s America had an extended love affair with all things Gallic. There was a Francophile First Lady in Jacqueline Kennedy. In New York the apogee of fine dining in the U.S. was a group of mannered French restaurants that included Lutèce La Côte Basque and La Caravelle a Kennedy favorite. (California was but a culinary backwater.) In the first season of The French Chef Julia exhorted her viewers to make duck à l’orange chicken livers à la Francaise (with Madeira sauce) and crepes suzette for their dinner parties.

Child ushered in a new appreciation of cooking but it was a style devoted to a singular vision of haute cuisine a reflection of her Cordon Bleu training. She cemented the notion by signing off each episode with the just-prepared dish a glass of wine and a hearty bon appetit!

MARTHA INC.

As the ‘70s entered the Me Decade ‘80s a new star-chef hit the airwaves and came to symbolize women’s emerging role in business (the era of Working Girl). Martha Stewart’s first book Entertaining hit in 1982 grown out of the former model and then stockbroker’s Connecticut catering business. Stoked by frequent newspaper publicity and appearances on shows of the time — The Oprah Winfrey Show and Larry King Live — she published a book every year for the rest of the decade (often efficiently ghost-written something Julia would have blanched at). Her careful precision and aesthetic cemented a largely white Northeastern WASP Americana ideal companion meals to the constructed Ralph Lauren aesthetic of the time.

Eventually Martha became more: a brand. Commonplace today it was head-turning when she consolidated all her tv print and merchandising into a new company Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia (not just media but omnimedia!). When the stock went public she became the first female self-made billionaire in the U.S.

At 81 today Stewart has evolved with the times defrosting her image. She has her own “Martha’s Chard” chardonnay Martha Meal Kits her just-opened The Bedford restaurant on the strip at Paris Las Vegas (modeled said Eater on her own 1925 country farmhouse in Bedford New York where she served part of her felony prison sentence in her 2005 stock-trading imbroglio) and her line of CBD edibles — and of course another just-announced streaming series this time on Roku. She also recently responded to rumors that she was dating Pete Davidson with the comment that he was “like the son I never had. He’s a charming boy finding his way.”

A FOOD NETWORK STAR

Which brings us to Ree “The Pioneer Woman” Drummond.

If you’re not familiar let’s get you up to speed. With nods to Giada De Laurentiis Ina Garten and Rachel Ray it’s Drummond who has been climbing the ranks at now Discovery-owned Food Network for the last 10 years who seems to have met the moment all from her countrified ranch kitchen just outside Pawhuska Oklahoma. With her husband Ladd whom she euphemistically refers to as “Marlboro Man” they are somewhat at odds with Ree’s “homey” vibe since their share of the family ranch empire totals a massive 433000 acres making them the 23rd largest landowners in the country. (Cue Yellowstone!)

They homeschool their four kids and she is unabashedly “traditional” in matters of romance. She claims he wouldn’t marry her until she was able to make his favorite breakfast Eggs in a Hole — and her version is a dish made with at least a half-stick of butter. (Contrast that with Stewart divorced and largely single the entire time she built her empire.)

In 2017 Food Network and Drummond were criticized after a particularly distasteful segment resurfaced from five years earlier.

As reported by Huffington Post:

The questionable segment…shows Drummond playing a “trick” on her family by serving them a batch of “Asian hot wings” instead of the Buffalo-style they’re expecting. Drummond’s crew is askance asking “Where are the real wings?” Another man says “I don’t trust ’em.” Then Drummond chuckles indulgently and tells them “I’m just kidding guys. I wouldn’t do that to you.” Then she pulls a tray of traditional Buffalo wings out of the oven inspiring one of these gourmets to say “Now those are some wings.”

A couple of weeks ago Drummond made a big step up to prime-time host with Big Bad Budget Battle produced by the Food Network’s biggest draw portly good ‘ole boy Guy Fieri with his white shock of hair.

Besides starring on The Pioneer Woman since 2011 Drummond also turns out cookbooks children’s series and home goods cookware and women’s wear all exclusive at Walmart. Drummond fans can even get a taste of the lifestyle with a stay in Pawhuska at the Drummond-owned lodging and retail-restaurant complex. Last year she even logged her first role in her own Yule movie Candy Coated Christmas for Discovery+ playing a small-town bakery owner.

Drummond presents herself as a bit of a rube and she’s okay with that. Her backcountry voice timbre and jokey manner is probably as beloved by her fans as they seem ridiculous to “city folk.” Though the Oklahoma native actually went to college at USC it doesn’t seem to have rubbed off.

It’s tempting to speculate on The Pioneer Woman and the network’s lineup of mostly male white prime-time hosts (the various shows are populated with a diverse slate of contestants and the network also features “daytime” cooking shows featuring more diverse chefs like Delicious Miss Brown and Molly Yeh of Girl Meets Farm). But Food Network seems untouched by the same battles that have roiled gourmands with issues of equity and representation that led to the resignations of Bon Appetit editor Adam Rappaport New York Times columnist Alison Roman the editor of the Los Angeles Times food section and others.

One could call those travails coastal fights internecine media battles that most Americans don’t care about. But as Discovery+ the streaming home of Drummond and all of Food Network prepares to combine into one entity with HBO Max as part of CEO David Zaslav’s new kingdom some are predicting culture clash.

There’s been a welter of speculation about a regressive turn coming on Zaslav’s watch following his hiring of a nearly all white male leadership team and appointment of six white men to the board.

The Daily Beast reported that laid-off Warners executives are foreseeing “a rejection of left-wing or highly diverse content in favor of more homogenous Middle America-friendly fare.” Interesting detail from the piece:

THE NEXT RECIPE

So will Max’s Selena + Chef CNN’s reruns of humanist Anthony Bourdain or even its bio-pic series Julia (wherein the first season she came face to face with her drag-queen doppelgänger) comfortably coexist on the same platform as The Pioneer Woman? One has to wonder even in the era of algorithms that allow the viewer to choose their own adventure.

Our narrative of any era’s defining female chef has mirrored our cultural shifts: from globalist Child ambitious post-women’s rights empire builder Stewart to Drummond whose popularity stems in part out of a seeming rejection of our media’s progressive values.

Putting all those ingredients together in 2022’s ultra-bifurcated era to this scribe it sounds like one potentially messy kitchen.

FINA executive director Brent Nowicki said the decision was made after a period of review and discussion on cap design between FINA and Soul Cap over the past year. There were no changes made to the design however according to Soul Cap.

“Promoting diversity and inclusivity is at the heart of FINA’s work and it is very important that all aquatic athletes have access to the appropriate swimwear” Nowicki told the U.K.’s Metro.

Soul Cap is a Black-owned business based out of the U.K. that specializes in covering hair that’s thick curly braided or otherwise textured — which is often difficult to fit into smaller swim caps.

According to Soul Cap FINA’s rejection said that “athletes competing at the International events never used neither require to use caps of such size and configuration” and that the shape of the cap does not “follow the natural form of the head.”

The decision has drawn heavy criticism from observers who say the caps are an important step to promoting racial diversity in a sport that has struggled in that area.

British Olympic swimmer (and Soul Cap ambassador) Alice Dearing told NPR that FINA’s ruling was an important step in ensuring that hair isn’t a barrier that prevents people from swimming. Dearing co-founded the Black Swimming Association in 2020.

“Knowing that it is acceptable to compete in this cap at the highest level of sport sends a message that hair should not be a barrier which stops people from participating” said Dearing who became the first Black swimmer to represent Great Britain at the Olympic level last year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vZmluYW5jaWFsLWluY2x1c2lvbi0zLzIwMjIvY2l0aWdyb3VwLXRvLWxhdW5jaC1maW5hbmNpYWwtaW5jbHVzaW9uLWluaXRpYXRpdmVzLXVuZGVyLW9jY3MtcHJvamVjdC1yZWFjaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Citigroup to Launch Financial Inclusion Efforts,"Citigroup will be launching two pilot programs under the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s Project REACh or Roundtable for Economic Access and Change to help underserved communities get more access to credit.

One of the programs will get credit cards to those without credit scores and the other will assist small businesses with minority women or veteran owners to get credit. Participation in Project REACh is a part of Citigroup’s $1 billion in strategic initiatives to help close the racial wealth gap and increase economic mobility in the United States according to the company’s press release.

Project REACh already works with several banks like JPMorgan Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp sharing bank account data to approve more borrowers for credit cards.

The issue of the credit-underserved is a big one in the U.S. with around 50 million residents lacking traditional credit scores. Banks usually look at credit scores when reviewing applications for various kinds of consumer debt.

The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) wrote that information about an applicant’s income and spending habits can be as good a measure of creditworthiness as traditional credit scores.

Efforts to help the underserved have cropped up elsewhere recently including the White House debut of a new Economic Opportunity Coalition (EOC) to look at economic disparities PYMNTS wrote.

When the Florida man took his Chevy Volt to Roger Dean Chevrolet for work they were quoted $26853.99 to replace their hybrid battery. This came as a complete shock because he bought the 2012 Chevy Volt for $10000. Even worse the 10-year-old car only had 70000 miles before it needed a complete battery replacement.

How much does it cost to replace a hybrid battery?

Several older used EV and hybrid owners have gone public with the outrageous costs of replacing EV batteries. The real pain in all this is how quickly this Chevy needed what might as well be a full engine replacement.

That $26853.99 wasn’t the end of the cost. This was the cost for just buying the battery; the dealership also quoted the Volt owners $1200 and here’s the kicker $33.98 for coolant. After taxes the grand total to replace the hybrid battery was quoted at $30842.15. Carscoops mentions that the car needing the $30000 worth of repairs could be sold to Carmax for $9000.

What does it mean when a car is totaled?

A Tesla crash vehicle | Patrick Pleul Getty Images

A totaled car makes us think of a wrecked car but that is not always the case. This 2012 Chevy Volt is the textbook definition of a totaled car. A car is totaled when the cost of the repairs outweighs the value of the vehicle. Considering that the repairs are 3x more than the value of the Volt I’d call that one toast.

Carscoops speculates that the owner most certainly didn’t pay the exorbitant repair bill. While it’s a no-brainer to turn down such a repair estimate we still want to know why the repair bill is so high. We know the batteries used in Hybrids and EVs are pricy tech full of pricy materials. However $30000 is extreme. This lofty price has led some online commenters to speculate that the price quote was a hoax. Aside from the monster expense the hoax believers point to the quote’s lack of address and phone number as proof of funny business.

While that argument sounds reasonable the Back the Truck Up blog and fact-checking website Snopes contacted the dealer confirming the insane price quote. The dealership shifts the blame onto the third-party supplier for the shocking cost. Back the Truck Up pointed out that the supplier was Spear Power Systems a Missouri-based manufacturer of lithium batteries used in aviation maritime and mining industries. However Carscoops says that SPS didn’t reply to Snopes when it attempted to confirm SPS was the source of the battery.

Could the dealership have inflated the cost?

Times are tough across the car market. We have seen time and time again that dealers are dealing with the current hardships by super-inflating prices of new and used cars citing scarcity as the defense for marking cars up by as much as $100000 over MSRP in some cases.

Roger Dean Chevrolet wrote on Facebook that it didn’t set the price of the battery saying “This is an estimate for a 12-year-old vehicle out of warranty and for a battery that is extremely hard to get due to the older technology of the 12-year-old vehicle.”

He added “In the newer EV or EUV vehicles with newer technology the batteries do cost less. Think of it like big screen TVs. Remember when the first big screen came out they were very expensive and as the technology advanced the prices became better. This battery is also out of warranty of 8yr/100k miles whatever hits first.”

In response to the dealership’s Facebook defense Reddit users allegedly dug up that GM Parts Online suggests that “a refurbished battery assembly for a 2011-14 Volt is available for $6880 having been reduced from $9100.”

Carscoops makes the final blow reminding customers that the cost of the battery – as quoted by the dealership – could more than cover the cost of a brand-new Chevy Bolt or Nissan Leaf with enough left over to get ice cream on the way home.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But rather than simply enjoy the party identitarians on both the left and the right have sought to fold it into Britain’s interminable culture wars.

An identitarian stand-off has ensued following several scenes of violence at this year’s event over the bank-holiday weekend. One such outbreak culminated in 21-year-old Takayo Nembhard being stabbed to death while six others were wounded in other incidents. That such violence has been allowed to happen once again at such a long-standing public event raises serious questions. Indeed this is not the first time the celebrations have been marred by violence. Carnival has long been developing an unfortunate reputation for poor safety. This should not be an insurmountable problem. But sadly it has become increasingly difficult to speak openly about it. Any criticism of Carnival and its organisation will be quickly dismissed as ‘racist’. For instance in the words of an article in Vice magazine Notting Hill Carnival ‘is disproportionately policed and scrutinised for bad behaviour both on the ground and in the reportage afterwards’. Why? ‘Because Britain is racist’ apparently.

Is this really fair? It is true that race plays a significant role in the history of Carnival. What would become Notting Hill Carnival first emerged in the mid-1960s as an attempt to repair the fractious race relations in London at the time (in 1958 there had been race riots in Notting Hill). So there is no denying that Carnival itself and the reaction to it have sometimes been framed in racial terms. But to see the public revulsion over knife violence purely as a sign of racism is absurd. What happened over the bank-holiday weekend was violent criminal behaviour. Yet woke identitarians seem to think we should simply look the other way if the alleged perpetrators or indeed victims are black. So much for black lives mattering.

But it is not just those on the left who have used this year’s Carnival to push their identitarian narrative. Some on the right have also cynically used the violence at this year’s event to rail against multiculturalism and immigration. Indeed one commentator even called the violence and stabbings ‘the cost of diversity’. The great thing about Notting Hill Carnival is that it is genuinely diverse in that it really does bring together people from all classes backgrounds and races. It is a living breathing experiment in cultural mixing. In this sense it is the exact opposite of the top-down version of ‘diversity’ pushed by our woke establishment which seeks to divide people along racial lines. So it is troubling that some see an event like Carnival as a potential threat to society or as an inherent source of conflict.

Amid the culture-war fury the Met are now calling for the future of Notting Hill Carnival to be ‘reviewed’. There are suggestions it could be moved to Hyde Park or even cancelled altogether. That would be a real tragedy. There is no doubt that the safety and security of Notting Hill Carnival needs improving. People have lost their lives. And that is why we need to speak out about the problem – so it can be fixed and Carnival can carry on. If not the state could step in to put an end to everyone’s fun.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydXplbHkuY29tL2xpdmUtYmxvZy1kYXktNS1jcnVpc2luZy1mb3ItMTQtcGVyLWRheS1vbi1jYXJuaXZhbHMtb2xkZXN0LXNoaXAtbGFzdC1kYXktd291bGQtaS1kby1pdC1hZ2Fpbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,(Live Blog Day 5) Cruising for $14 Per Day on Carnival's Oldest Ship: Last Day. Would I Do It Again?!,"Note: I am currently sailing a 5-day Mexican cruise aboard Carnival’s oldest ship — Carnival Ecstasy a trip that cost only $14 per day in cruise fare. Each day I cover the experience giving you an inside peek at what it’s like to sail this trip.

You can view other days here:

For one of her final times Carnival Ecstasy is on the way back to Mobile Alabama. After more than 30 years of cruising the ship has roughly six more weeks of sailing before she is set to leave the fleet.

As this trip winds to a close knowing that I’m on a ship that’s taken literally millions of passengers on cruises around the world… and won’t be doing that anymore… is a bit strange to think about. There are so many things I’d love to just take off the walls as a souvenir but I don’t think Carnival looks too kindly upon that.

Instead enjoying one more day at sea is my parting gift. Thankfully the weather has been great to enjoy just that. Calm seas just a few clouds here and there and lots of sunshine.

I had planned to having the Sea Day Brunch in the dining room but changed plans when I saw the line to get in. Carnival is having everyone “check in” for a table in the dining room on the app and then head to the podium when you get a notification your table is ready. In my view it seems to be contributing to longer lines as dozens of people just stand around the dining room entrance until the app says to go ahead.

Instead of that I just grabbed a quick bite at the buffet sat outside and enjoyed the sea view while I ate. From there it was off to the gym for a quick workout and then back to the cabin to catch up on a little work before the pool.

But back at the cabin was a surprise.

Now for the most part this trip has been great. But if you’re someone who is particularly picky and likes things perfect then there might be times that you didn’t like.

Case in point around Day 3 I noticed that the cabin next to mine — which had “Roll Tide” door decorations — had apparently moved about 10 doors down the hall. I noticed it but didn’t think much of it.

Also that day I realized that my cabin had a hint of mildew smell when I came in. After a minute I wouldn’t notice it anymore so it wasn’t enough to complain to Guest Services. But it was enough that I looked through all my laundry to make sure I didn’t leave a wet swimsuit somewhere. Any time I walked in the slight smell would be there.

Well today two and two were put together. I saw that maintenance was inside the cabin next to mine working when I came back from the gym. Ceiling tiles were down the bed was moved and sitting in my cabin working I hear voices a hammer pinging an occasional grinder and then a welder were being used. It seems possible a pipe leaked next door.

The noise went on for at least 45 minutes until I decided to head to the pool. Again if you’re easy-going it’s no big deal; just head out around the ship until they are done. However I know some people would have been upset about it.

With the sunny day the pool deck was hopping. Instead of fighting for a seat I headed to the back of the ship where there were still plenty of folks but lots of space. I mentioned earlier that I like more activities on a cruise ship and just hanging out on a lounger is fine for a bit but I need some more excitement. So on the last day I made sure to hit the waterslides on the ship. Given that the cruise is sailing just after school started back I didn’t have to elbow too many small children out of the way for a ride.

From there it was time for a little sun before hitting up a tasty lunch at BlueIguana.

Now for dessert I decided to treat myself. I don’t know what it is but the regular desserts on this cruise just have not done it for me. Apart from some tiramisu the first night I haven’t found anything that I’ve thought was that good.

But there’s a small coffee shop on the ship (called Rolls Royce) and they have a cooler filled with tons of good-looking stuff for an extra charge. So I opted to try a piece of the chocolate cake in the hopes that paying a little ($2.25 per slice) would be well worth the investment.

Worth it was an understatement. Insanely rich the five-layer slice was unbelievably good. I felt like a schmuck for not getting a piece every day of the cruise. In fact despite having a big sweet tooth I couldn’t even finish it all because it was so sweet. I highly recommend a piece… especially if you have another person to help you tackle it.

The afternoon has slowed down somewhat. As I’ve mentioned with the smaller ship there aren’t a lot of things to do around the ship apart from the basics — pool casino and drinks. Instead I’m using the time to pack a bit and get ready for departure so that I don’t have to do it tonight.

There are a couple of things I want to be sure to get in before the cruise ends including a drink and karaoke in the Chinatown Lounge and tonight’s Motor City production that highlights Motown music.

Update: Just got back from watching the Motown show. Absolutely a hit. Tons of fun and a very talented cast.

Tomorrow morning it’s time for debarkation and the flight home.

Worth It? Final Thoughts on Cruising Carnival’s Oldest Ship for Cheap

So what’s the bottom line on sailing for just $70 for five days on Carnival’s oldest ship? Worth it? A disaster? Would I do it again if I could?

I will say that coming into this cruise I had some worries. If you’ve ever seen the movie Vegas Vacation where they visit the off-strip casino to win back Clark Griswold’s money then you have an idea of what I pictured.

That wasn’t the case here at all. First let’s start with the ship. It’s old. It’s small. It’s showing some wear and tear. And it’s not on par with the ships built today.

But there is some charm there too. I mentioned on Day 1 that it feels like a time capsule. The decor is very 1990s and I dig it. If it were my first cruise I’m not sure what I’d think. But having sailed a lot of different ships Ecstasy is a fun change of pace that’s different from anything else I’ve sailed.

That said I think that three or four days is plenty. Five days is getting a bit long. A week-long cruise? I couldn’t do it. There’s simply not enough to do and experience onboard.

But I also come back to the price tag and the things I got to do on this cruise.

For way less than the cost of a plane ticket I was able to visit the Yucatan. I swam on a private beach in Cozumel. I got to see cenotes that are no less than natural wonders. While the ship is at sea I was able to view the Milky Way rainbows days of sunshine and beautiful dark storm clouds roll across the horizon. I met some great folks. And I ate one hell of a piece of chocolate cake.

In other words I came in expecting one thing… but got an experience completely different from that. Carnival Ecstasy may not be my first choice for a ship to sail — and it definitely wouldn’t be for everyone — but I’m glad I got the chance to enjoy the experience it all while she is still at sea. I don’t think I’d do it again… but still had a ton of fun.

Interesting Observations

Looking through my onboard account summary on the Carnival Hub app I have a random credit of my account for $5.71 for “Refund Taxes Fees & Port Expenses.” This isn’t the first time I’ve noticed random refunds or credits on a Carnival cruise. Next time you sail keep an eye out and you might hit the random money lottery too.

All you bacon lovers heads up. In the morning it seems hit or miss if bacon is served. Twice it hasn’t been available and I’m not sure why. Another time it was. Even if it is available the staff serves it to keep the waste down. One day I had a random passenger sit by me at breakfast when tables were hard to find. His breakfast? A pile of bacon on a plate… and nothing else. What a king.

One complaint I have? It’s constantly cold in my room. I’m from Texas. I don’t need a 65-degree cabin. There’s no thermostat in the room just a big vent in the middle of the ceiling with a knob to open or close it. Even all the way closed It’s chilly. The best part of the day is heading out to the pool deck first thing in the morning to thaw out.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVtb3VudGFpbmVlci5jb20vc3BvcnRzL3R1c2NvbGEtY3Jvc3MtY291bnRyeS1vcGVucy1zZWFzb24tYXQtd25jLWNhcm5pdmFsL2FydGljbGVfY2E1OTE0MmMtMjg3YS0xMWVkLWE1MGUtYmI0YWVmOTkzN2UwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tuscola cross-country opens season at WNC Carnival,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

The global corporate insurance carrier analyzed over 240000 marine insurance industry claims over the past five years costing over $9 billion reporting that the danger of fires is increasing and already the most expensive cause of loss accounting for 18 percent of the value of all claims.

In a new safety bulletin Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty reports that the number of fires on board large vessels has increased significantly in recent years. Across all vessel types and causes fire/explosion was the second top cause of the 54 total losses reported in 2021 accounting for eight of the losses. Fires were second with only vessels that foundered 12 vessels were lost in 2021. Further over the past decade fire ranks as the third top cause of loss overall accounting for 120 out of a reported 892 total losses. Again only foundered (465) or wrecked/stranded vessels (164) accounted for more claims.

In 2021 fire was the third top cause of shipping incidents overall around the globe – behind machinery damage (1311) and collision (222). There have been 41 total losses involving ro-ros over the past decade with fires causing six losses. Among the specific incidents they highlight the February 2022 fire and subsequent sinking of the ro-ro Felicity Ace the June 2020 fire on the car carrier Höegh Xiamen and the January 2020 fire on the containership Cosco Pacific. The common denominator in all the fires as well as specific instances of container fires was the presence of lithium-ion batteries.

“AGCS has long warned about the potential dangers that lithium-ion batteries can pose for the shipping and wider logistics industries whether they are being transported inside electric vehicles or as standalone cargo if they are not handled stored or transported correctly with fire being a significant hazard” said Captain Rahul Khanna Global Head of Marine Risk Consulting AGCS. “Batteries are not only a potential cause of fire if damaged overcharged or subjected to high temperatures they can also aggravate other causes of fire at sea and are difficult to extinguish as they have the potential to reignite days or even weeks later.”

Allianz highlights four main hazards involving the transportation of these batteries including fire explosion toxic gases and the potential for thermal runaway (a rapid self-heating fire that can cause an explosion) and is considered a likely element in the loss of the Felicity Ace this year. In most shipboard incidents Allianz warns that a thermal runaway event can be a significant possibility unless immediate action is taken by the crew such as suppressing a fire with copious amounts of water over a long period of time. However this can be extremely challenging due to factors such as early detection being difficult a shortage of crew members and a lack of adequate firefighting capabilities on board.

The bulletin identifies the most common causes of the fire hazard as being substandard manufacturing of battery cells/devices; over-charging of the battery cells; over-temperature by short-circuiting and damaged battery cells or devices which among other causes can result from poor packing and handling or cargo shift in rough seas if not adequately secured.

Ro-ro and car carrier vessels they point out can be more exposed to fire and stability issues than other vessels. To facilitate the transport of automobiles and other vehicles the internal spaces are not divided into separate sections like other cargo ships. The lack of internal bulkheads can have an adverse impact on fire safety and a small fire on one vehicle or battery can grow out of control very quickly. Vehicles are not easily accessible once loading has been completed. The large volume of air inside the open cargo decks provides a ready supply of oxygen in case of fire.

“Safe carriage has become an emerging risk concern for the shipping community raising questions about the adequacy of fire detection and firefighting capabilities on board vessels cargo loading procedures and even whether changes in vessel design may be necessary given specialist equipment is required to extinguish any blazes” says Khanna.

Allianz recommends that the primary focus must be on loss prevention focusing on storage and in transit. They are calling for training to ensure staff is trained to follow correct packing and handling procedures and that seafarers have had Li-ion battery firefighting training. It is critical they said to check all EVs are properly secured to prevent any shifting during transportation. They also recommend checking whether the EVs have an undamaged battery system and ensuring there is no charging during the voyage In transit anything that can aid early detection is critical including watchkeeping/fire rounds and utilizing thermal scanners gas detectors heat/smoke detectors and CCTV cameras.

“If the maritime industry is to improve its incident record related to the transportation of lithium-ion batteries all parties involved in the supply chain must understand the hazards involved the most common causes and the problems associated with transporting in commerce” says Captain Randall Lund Senior Marine Risk Consultant at AGCS and one of the authors of the report. “Regulations and guidance are specific in addressing these batteries to help prevent most incidents but these can only be effective if they are communicated and enforced.""

Photo:AFP

The commissioning of India's first home-built aircraft carrier on Friday received pretty much flattery from the Western media. A CNN report claimed the aircraft carrier has put India into ""an elite league of the world's naval powers"" and an AFP article hailed it as ""a milestone in government efforts to counter China's growing military assertiveness in the region.""Their intention couldn't be any clearer: By shaping ""China's much larger and growing fleet"" as the major target of India's first home-built aircraft carrier they want to instigate tension and even confrontation between China and India creating public opinion pressure to push India into an anti-China forefront. It's particularly important for India to stay sober amid Western flattery that is aimed at luring India into an anti-China cannon fodder.It indeed was a moment for India to celebrate its progress in indigenous shipbuilding capabilities. Building The INS Vikrant whose name is the Sanskrit word for ""powerful"" or ""courageous"" hasn't been easy for India. It took 13 years to commission the indigenous aircraft carrier since the keel-laying of it was done in 2009. The carrier has filled the nation with ""new confidence"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at Friday's ceremony marked by fanfare at the Cochin Shipyard in India's southern Kerala state declaring India has taken one more step toward becoming a developed nation.But was the West really happy for India? Modi also unfurled the country's new naval flag without a British colonial symbol left over from India's colonial era on the commissioning ceremony a milestone in India's de-Western colonialism. This however was seldom mentioned in most Western reports.New Delhi needs to guard against the West's attempts to turn the moment into a military event against China. ""China has never regarded India as a threat nor has China taken India as an imaginary rival and target when it develops its own aircraft carriers and navy forces"" Lan Jianxue director of the Department for Asia-Pacific Studies at the China Institute of International Studies told the Global Times. He noted India's biggest enemy is its own poverty backwardness and insufficient development as some Indian scholars have acknowledged.If India falls into the Western public opinion trap to provoke China and regard China as its ""main rival"" that needs to be contained it will gain no benefits but only become a cannon fodder warned Song Zhongping a Chinese military expert. China is ahead of India in terms of both the number and technology of aircraft carriers and China's carrier localization rate is higher than that of India.""India's aircraft carrier has a relatively small tonnage limited combat capabilities and ranges and certain technologies are still dependent on foreign countries which has constrained its combat effectiveness and supporting power"" said Song.For an ambitious India that direly needs development external stability is an important guarantee for domestic development and maintaining stable relations with major powers is especially important. India needs to keep its strategic sobriety and not to be fooled by the Western flattery. In recent years the US and the West have increased their efforts to curry favor with India their real purpose is to fool India to play a bigger role in their Indo-Pacific Strategy to serve their ends. They hope to take advantage of the confrontation between India and China.A view in the West and within India as well holds that China doesn't want to see India's development. This doesn't hold water at all. When it comes to developing relations with India China has attached great importance to the special significance of ""the dragon and elephant dancing together."" Aircraft carriers are considered to be one of the most effective strategic tools to safeguard national maritime interests. There is no arms race between China and India and China will not view India's military progress from a perspective of zero-sum game. It's also hoped that India will not be deceived by the honeyed words of the West.Both China and India are emerging economies committed to economic and social development. Their common interests far outweigh their differences. China and India should be partners for mutual success instead of adversaries of mutual attrition.The author is a reporter with the Global Times. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL2Zyb20tcnVzc2lhLXRvLWZyYW5jZS1jb3VudHJpZXMtaGFpbC1pbmRpYS1zLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWNhcnJpZXItaW5zLXZpa3JhbnQtMTIyMDkwMzAwNDE5XzEuaHRtbNIBmQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9mcm9tLXJ1c3NpYS10by1mcmFuY2UtY291bnRyaWVzLWhhaWwtaW5kaWEtcy1haXJjcmFmdC1jYXJyaWVyLWlucy12aWtyYW50LTEyMjA5MDMwMDQxOV8xLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From Russia to France countries hail India's aircraft carrier INS Vikrant,"New Delhi Sep 3: Several foreign envoys who attended the commissioning ceremony of India's first indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant in Kochi on Friday have acknowledged the country's rise as a global power.

Hailing India's growing defence manufacturing prowess the foreign ambassadors also committed to making stronger partnerships with New Delhi keeping in mind the fast-changing geostrategic situation as well as security concerns in the Indo-Pacific and the Indian Ocean Region.

Denis Alipov the Russian Ambassador to India highlighted not only the friendship between the two nations which has remained intact 'despite current difficulties and tensions in the world' but also that the warship has been developed with Russia's participation.

'Participated today in the commissioning of INS Vikrant by the Honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi. India's first swadeshi aircraft carrier. A glorious moment for the country and its people. Russia is proud to be part of it. Jai Vikrant! Shano varuna!' tweeted Alipov.

The seasoned diplomat posted several photographs of the event held at the Cochin Shipyard before proceeding to visit Cochin University of Science and Technology to hold a discussion on the prospects of Russia-India collaboration in education and scientific research.

'It's a proud moment for India that they built an indigenous major aircraft carrier. India is moving towards self-reliance and has shown that it's moving fastly towards becoming a major global power. The world needs super strong India' the Russian Ambassador told ANI later.

French Ambassador Emmanuel Lenain congratulated India and said that Paris is already looking forward to seeing INS Vikrant sail together with the French Navy's flagship aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle in the Indo-Pacific.

'Congratulations India on commissioning IAC Vikrant and joining the club of nations capable of manufacturing aircraft carriers! France looks forward to seeing INS Vikrant sail together with Charles de Gaulle carrier in our joint actions in the Indo Pacific' tweeted Lenain.

Having already vowed to make the India-France strategic partnership 'a force for global good' Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron have made it a point to extend the operational cooperation between the two countries in the Indo-Pacific region.

Both India and France have also been focused on partnering more strongly in the field of co-designing co-development and co-production of different defence equipment in India.

Commenting on a video of Barak 1 surface-to-air missiles (SAM) being test-fired from INS Vikramaditya the Israeli embassy in India congratulated India on the commissioning of 'Made-in-India INS Vikrant' and said that it was 'excited to see the productive outcome' of India-Israel cooperation in the defence sector.

'Congratulations to our Indian brothers. Job well done! A small glimpse at India-Israel defence cooperation. United we will prevail' tweeted Naor Gilon the Ambassador of Israel to India.

Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) in collaboration with the Indian industry comprising of private and public sectors including MSMEs have jointly developed the Medium Range Surface to Air Missile (MRSAM) a state-of-the-art missile system against aerial threats like fighter aircraft UAVs guided and unguided munitions and cruise missiles.

Alex Ellis the British High Commissioner to India tweeted a video of him from the flight deck of INS Vikrant and spotlighted that both India and the United Kingdom believe in the importance of the freedom of the high seas.

Our growing interactions are a testimony to the shared commitment to a rules-based international system a belief in the values of open trade and the importance of the freedom of the high seas - a right conveyed on all nations.

'Honoured to be present at the commissioning of INS Vikrant by Narendra Modi - a great day for Indian Navy and for open and free seas' tweeted Ellis.

Last October as the UK's Carrier Strike Group (CSG) led by HMS Queen Elizabeth sailed into the Bay of Bengal in a powerful demonstration of the UK-India Comprehensive Strategic Partnership the British High Commissioner mentioned that both the Indian and the Royal Navy are blue-water multi-carrier navies which places them in a very exclusive club.

Australia's High Commissioner to India Barry O'Farrell also tweeted about his experience of seeing INS Vikrant closely in Kochi today.

But those webs aren't from spiders. Fall webworms are moth caterpillars that are native to North America.

Webworms can typically be seen later in the summer munching on a whole variety of deciduous trees such as maple elm and poplar. For the most part they aren't picky bugs.

Unlike other caterpillars webworms like to live in large communities.

After hatching the larvae they will stay together in a community to build a large web nest to use as shelter.

""It protects them from things like birds and ants and other predators that might affect them"" said entomologist Ilan Domnich.

LISTEN |

Because the nest is so tightly wound the temperature inside them is high which increases the metabolism of the worms and speeds up their development.

The webworm will go through six different stages as a caterpillar staying close to the tent and only venturing out to eat.

""That's when people will notice defoliation in the trees when those big caterpillars are eating lots of leaves"" Domnich said.

Do webworms cause damage to the trees?

Webworms don't always damage the trees.

If you get a normal webworm population they may eat all the leaves off of a tree Domnich said.

""The tree won't be very happy but it'll be just fine. Next year it will grow all new leaves"" he said.

However if the webworm population comes back year after year trees could get stressed out and eventually die.

""But that will typically only happen when you get these huge outbreak populations"" Domnich said.

The worms go through cycles where there's just a few of them around and next year they're everywhere.

How can you treat webworms?

One way to treat webworms is by using pesticide one that specifically targets caterpillars so as to reduce harm to other types of insects.

""All the other bugs everything that's eating the bugs the birds and everything like that it's all part of the same ecosystem"" Domnich said.

Following the rules and guidelines for pesticide spraying is very important Domnich said.

""You never spray when it's going to rain because it's just going to wash out"" he said.

Similarly you never spray during the middle of the day when pollinators are active.

Another way to control the caterpillars Domnich said is to simply pick them up and throw them away.

Yearly webworm outbreaks can cause stress to the tree and eventually kill it but that's not always the case. (Ishita Verma/CBC)

""The best way to get rid of them is just to use ... a garden fork or those forks you use for roasting hot dogs and just reach up into the web and twirl it like you're picking up spaghetti and just pull the web out of the the tree"" Mike Jenkins pest management coordinator for the City of Edmonton told CBC's Radio Active.

Webworms don't have itchy hairs and they also don't bite making them safe to grab.

""Or remove the cocoons if you see those"" Domnich said.

The cocoons are spun out of silk and look like a big fuzzy pill about an inch long.

Once in the cocoon the caterpillars fall to the ground pupate over the winter and hatch out as moths in the spring.

While the image of worms in a web nest can be gross and slightly off-putting webworms are a great food source for birds and are an important part of the ecosystem Domnich said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9ic2VydmVydG9kYXkuY29tL25ld3MvdG9wLXN0b3JpZXMvMjAyMi8wOS9ibGluZC1zcG90LWluLXRoZS1hc2gtdHJlZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blind spot in the ash tree | News Sports Jobs,"Editor’s Note: This column originally ran in 2019.

Where are your blind spots? In a car these are the spots that you cannot see when turning or backing up. Fancy cameras and screens are being used to help drivers see their blind spots. But no camera can cure a mental blind spot and the effects of that are everywhere. We often don’t see the things that we haven’t trained our brains to see.

There is a famous video of a group of people watching dancers onstage. A man walks through them in a bear costume but no one notices because they are so focused on the dancers. The human mind is capable of such focus that it is possible to not see something really obvious.

One of those disconcerting moments happened to me one past summer as I talked to Cornell entomologist Jason Dombroskie who was collecting moths at Audubon as part of a research project to identify the moths of New York.

My knowledge of moths is limited to identifying only a couple dozen species of the hundreds that are out there. Some are easy to identify most are put into my mental “small gray moth” category and ignored.

I was rather proud of myself when I could identify some of the moths that he had found since the odds of him finding one of the few I know were slim. One of these was the Waved Sphinx moth. These gray moths are masters of camouflage but have distinctive wavy black lines and a white eye-shaped dot on the wing that make it one that I recognize.

“This moth is in danger of going extinct” Dombroskie said. This news came as a complete shock to me but it shouldn’t have. The answer to why was lurking in my blind spot hiding in plain sight amongst all the facts that I knew but hadn’t put together yet.

Waved Sphinx moth caterpillars mostly eat Ash trees though there is evidence that they will eat oak and privet as well. Ash trees are slowly but surely disappearing from the region with the spread of a tiny green insect called the Emerald Ash Borer (EAB). This insect bores into the ash tree and kills it within a year or so. As the main food source for the caterpillar dwindles the moth may disappear as well.

According to the journal “Biological Invasions” there are forty-three species that depend on ash trees and may disappear. Some are moths like the Waved Sphinx and others are lesser known insects that feed on the leaves seeds and bark of ash trees. These species only feed on ash and not other plants similar to how Monarch caterpillars only eat milkweed.

The study noted 282 species that use ash trees. Of these 208 are at a low risk for going extinct. Thirteen are at a medium risk and 17 are at a high-moderate risk of extinction that join into the 44 at high risk.

For me that was a pretty big blind spot. At Audubon we treated the ash trees in the Ted Grisez Arboretum to keep the Emerald Ash Borers from killing them. My thoughts never went beyond the tragic loss of a tree species to wonder at the loss of other species that could disappear with them.

If the disappearance of ash trees from the landscape could wipe out other species did that happen in the past? A quick search revealed that the chestnut blight of the twentieth century took out at least five species of moth and a weevil as well as billions of American Chestnut trees. While scientists are working on helping the trees make a comeback the insects that disappeared with the majority of the chestnuts are gone for good.

When an insect goes extinct when the plant it depends on disappears it is called co-extinction. While the American Chestnut did not go extinct it became scarce enough that many of the insects that depended on it disappeared.

This was my blind spot. As I figure out how to get dead ash trees safely down or buy ash firewood that is popping up in people’s yards I never thought to look at the ripple effect of a tree’s disappearance. It affects insects and through them other animals whose lives revolve around a tree threatened by an Asian insect brought here by accident.

It’s a pretty big blind spot and one that I was glad to have pointed out. One of the hardest things to do is think of all the consequences of human actions. It never occurred to me that I would have to mourn the loss of moths that disappeared with the ash or that there were species I would never see because of the disappearance of the American Chestnut. It puts everything in a different light and even if there is little I can do to stop it I can still stop and pay attention to the loss of a species.

They are looking for ash trees that are resistant to EAB. They are popping up here and there. With luck in ten years I will not be writing a eulogy for the insects that died with their only food source.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL25vcmZvbGtkYWlseW5ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3bWFuLWdyb3ZlLW1hbi1maW5lZC1zZW50ZW5jZWQtdG8tcHJvYmF0aW9uLWZvci1seWluZy10by1jcm9wLWluc3VyZXIvYXJ0aWNsZV80MTU2MWQyMC0yYjk4LTExZWQtOWJkMy0yN2JhODk1NmU4YmQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Newman Grove man fined sentenced to probation for lying to crop insurer,Holly Hernandez of Center formerly of Verdigre is fighting more than triple-negative breast cancer; she is also on a mission to spread awareness regarding the diagnosis and what it means for her as well as others.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveHdlYXRoZXIuY29tL2VhcnRoLXNwYWNlL3Blc3RpY2lkZS1mcmVlLW1pbGt3ZWVkLWJ1dHRlcmZseS1nYXJkZW5zLWhhcmQtdG8tZmluZC1udXJzZXJpZXMtc3R1ZHktZmluZHPSAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3h3ZWF0aGVyLmNvbS9lYXJ0aC1zcGFjZS9wZXN0aWNpZGUtZnJlZS1taWxrd2VlZC1idXR0ZXJmbHktZ2FyZGVucy1oYXJkLXRvLWZpbmQtbnVyc2VyaWVzLXN0dWR5LWZpbmRzLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pesticide-free milkweed for butterfly gardens may be hard to find at nurseries new study finds,"Gardeners hoping to aid the endangered monarch butterfly by planting milkweed might have a difficult time avoiding harmful pesticides if they shop at nurseries according to a new study.

The University of Nevada Reno and Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation gathered more than 200 milkweed leaf samples from retail nurseries across 15 states and tested them for pesticides. Their findings were published this week in the journal Biological Conservation.

Milkweed is the primary food source for caterpillars and adult monarchs use it as a breeding ground.

""Milkweed is really important to the monarch butterfly. All butterflies have specific host plants that they depend on. The milkweed happens to be the host plant for monarch butterflies"" explained study coauthor Matt Forister professor of biology at the University of Nevada Reno.

Over the last few decades the western monarch butterfly population has dropped from the millions recorded in the 1980s to as low as 1800. One of the biggest threats to the butterflies is the loss of breeding habitat throughout the U.S. which is why conservationists recommend people plant native milkweed in their gardens.

""We wanted to understand the pesticides that are used in and around and on milkweed in nursery production"" explained Aimee Code pesticide program director at the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation. ""That's why we kind of went across the country and bought milkweed plants from retailers to better understand what kind of chemicals we might find on those plants and on the day of purchase what are we going to see.""

MONARCH BUTTERFLIES ARE NOW LISTED AS ENDANGERED

The study's lead author Christopher Halsch explained that pesticides are broken down into herbicides fungicides and insecticides.

""Generally these things being on leaves … almost certainly not with the intention of going after the monarch but they can end up on leaves and then a caterpillar that happens to have its egg laid there ends up on this leaf"" Halsch said. ""And you have compounds that are designed to in some cases literally attack caterpillars in other cases go after fungus which has been shown to have negative impacts on the physiology of caterpillars.""

Over 60 pesticides were found during the study with as many as 28 chemicals on one plant. Only nine of those chemicals have been tested to understand the impacts on monarchs; the impacts of the others are generally unknown. Halsch said additional studies are needed to know the full effect of all the chemical compounds found on nursery plants.

""I was surprised we saw as strong that signal as we did as we know almost nothing about compounds. And of the ones we do we found some harmful concentrations"" Halsch said. ""When you are finding 12 compounds per leaf on average and most of those are unknown.

Halsch said more information about the compounds can have a meaningful effect on understanding how they impact wild caterpillars which are not usually their targets.

The survey included large retailers and small local nurseries.

""A single location store was just as likely to contain something harmful as a large corporation you purchase from"" Halsch said.

What can a home gardener do to avoid harmful chemicals?

Experts said that although this news might be frustrating to home gardeners looking to help pollinators there are steps that can be taken to reduce chemicals in those regardless of where the milkweed is purchased.

The problem of pesticides is not just about monarchs but is a concern for many insects. Home gardeners can make things worse by spraying other pesticides in their yards when it may not be necessary and ultimately more harmful. Code recommends researching the problem before using chemicals or contacting a local extension office for help.

Also be aware of unregulated claims on plant labels.

""Don't assume that ‘pollinator-friendly’ or ‘valuable to wildlife’ means anything. It's not related to pesticide use"" Code said. ""It means that's a plant that would attract them.""

Researchers with the study found plants in nurseries with these ""wildlife-friendly"" labels had just as many chemicals as those without.

Wherever a gardener turns for help Forister said they should ask about non-chemical options for their garden.

""Use this as a reminder to not be adding more toxins to your garden"" Forister said.

HOPE FLOATS: WESTERN MONARCH BUTTERFLY COUNT YIELDS HIGHEST TOTAL IN 5 YEARS

Forister said additional research is needed to determine if there are more steps an individual can take when they bring home milkweed purchased from a nursery such as removing the plant from the soil it came in or washing the leaves.

A recent population survey this winter found a monarch butterfly population increase. Still experts warn that is not a sign they are on the rebound.

""It's like a stock. You can have a stock that's bouncing around and going down over time but you're still going to have a couple of good years"" Forister sid. ""So the Monarchs have had a couple of good years and that's fine. There are many other butterflies in North America that have not had a couple of good years and are also on downward trajectories.""

The study's authors stressed it is crucial to keep pollinating gardens growing along with taking steps to reduce pesticides to be part of the solution.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3Mvc3VwZXJ5YWNodC0wMDctc2lua3MtYWZ0ZXItcnVubmluZy1hZ3JvdW5kLWluLWdyZWVjZS0xOTc3MzIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Superyacht 007 Sinks After Running Aground in Greece,"You could say that 2022 has not been a good year for superyachts in general and you wouldn’t be completely off the mark. In between seizures and legal complications and what seems like an increased number of totaling incidents superyacht-watching has definitely gotten more… dramatic this past year.

We can now add another incident to that ever-growing list: 007 a superyacht delivered by Aegean Yachts in 2006 has sunk after running aground off the coast of Greece. It happened on Friday night (September 2) with reports in the local media saying that the captain hit rocks under the surface of the water.The ship is now almost completely submerged in Kolona Bay in Kythnos in the Cyclades island chain in Greece only some 15 meters (49.2 feet) from the beach. The Greek Coast Guard has confirmed the incident but for the time being it can’t speak on the circumstances surrounding it – and for very good reason since an investigation into the cause is still underway.The good news is that the five people onboard the vessel were rescued by the Coast Guard and transported to safety. The other piece of good news is that Coast Guard personnel was able to contain the superyacht with a floating sea wall and there have been no reports of pollution as of the time of press. Given the location of the wreck it is very likely that a recovery operation will be attempted.The captain called in for help after running aground as the ship started taking on water. Shortly afterwards 007 listed on the port side and eventually capsized. Photos and videos have emerged on social media showing the extent of the damage  and you will find some of them included in this article.007 is a 49-meter (160-foot) superyacht that wasn’t available for charter but was often described as the perfect family boat. Initially delivered as a 32-meter (105-footer) under the name Royal Enterprise at the Bodrum shipyard in Turkey it’s been through several refits which have contributed to its current explorer-like more aggressive silhouette. These refits included a lengthening of the hull to 49 meters (160 feet) adding another deck and a small touch-and-go helipad on top.With a design by Yavuz Mete 007 offered accommodation for 10 guests and 5 crew. Powered by twin Caterpillar engines that developed a total of 1300 hp it could travel at a top speed of 12 knots (13.8 mph / 22.2 kph). None of that matters now as it’s come to what could possibly be its end on the rocky shore of Greece."

Ebenhack | AP) Utah cornerback Clark Phillips III (1) during the first half of an NCAA college football game against Florida Saturday Sept. 3 2022 in Gainesville Fla. The Utes were grounded again as they tried to leave Florida when their charter flight from Gainesville Regional Airport experienced mechanical issues.

All the University of Utah football team wanted Saturday night following its season-opening loss to Florida was to get out of the state and its lung-crushing humidity. But the swamp wouldn’t let it leave.

The Utes’ charter flight scheduled to depart Gainesville Regional Airport around midnight following the game was delayed because of mechanical issues according to a Twitter post made by Utes communications director Paul Kirk early Sunday.

The flight was rescheduled for 4:10 a.m. EDT but did not leave at that time either. According to a tweet by ESPN commentator Dan Orlovsky the team sat in the plane on the tarmac during the four-hour delay before being unloaded.

Photos posted at 5:25 a.m. show players sprawled out on the floor of the airport and on benches as they awaited their flight.

The team is “working on alternative plans to return the team to SLC as quickly as possible” Kirk wrote. In the meantime he said the University of Florida offered to help with accommodations for the team and traveling party. Utes athletic director Mark Harlan later tweeted in response to this article that the Gators had provided a hotel partner buses and meals. He said he expected Utah to be able to charter a flight home by the end of the day.

In fact the Utes finally landed back in Salt Lake City a little before 7:30 p.m. on Sunday.

Some members of the coaching staff were able to book tickets back on a flight out of Jacksonville according to KSL sports reporter Josh Furlong. He posted on Twitter that he saw the coaches on his flight leaving that airport Sunday morning.

“Looking like they’re trying to get them home however they can” he wrote.

Durham School Services the district’s bus contractor was four drivers short of the 125 drivers needed to cover the district’s planned 125 routes according to a memo from the district’s Transportation Supervisor Zachary Nicotera to school board members following his meeting with Durham officials on Tuesday.

But Durham has five drivers who may be ready to hit the road on the first day or soon after and it’s bringing two drivers in from the Schenectady area where the company has extra drivers the memo said. And the company should have enough drivers for all 125 routes within the first few weeks of school officials have said.

“All schools are routed” said Edward Flavin vice president of external communications for National Express Durham’s parent company. “We are making minor adjustments to a few routes to cover all routes assigned until the last few positions are filled. We don’t expect any routes to go uncovered or operate anywhere near last year.”

That’s a big change from last year when Durham started out in September with only 62 drivers a local manifestation of a national school bus driver shortage. The company never got a full contingent of drivers during the 2021-22 school year its first year of operation in Utica. As a result many students arrived late for schools others got picked up late after school and some were left standing at their bus stops.

2021-22 school year:Bus company: Driver shortages leading to Utica school bus delays threats from parents

2021-22 school year:Utica school buses still running late but company still says it expects progress

The Utica Academy of Science Charter School pushed back its start time which was too early for buses that dropped off Utica city school students first. But students still frequently arrived late ― often considerably late ― throughout the year staff said.

But Hanka Grabovica regional student affairs officer said communication and cooperation with the district is better this year.

“As of now everything looks good and the way it should be” she said. “All of our students received a bus schedule of picking and dropping them off. Now we just have to wait and see how everything will work out.” School board members questioned Durham officials following a presentation on the driver situation at the board’s August meeting. “I’m very concerned” Vice President Donald Dawes said “about kids being on a corner somewhere and not being picked up. … I was waiting all last year to hear that everyone was being picked up and I’m still waiting.”

“We’re getting very close” Brett Wester regional manager told him “to a good position. … Where we’re at is manageable.”

School bus driver positions consistently difficult to fill

Districts across the state have been struggling to fill all kinds of positions within their schools this summer but bus drivers and substitute teachers have consistently been the hardest to fill according to the New York State Council of School Superintendents. Yet Durham has significantly increased its numbers.

Although the company is still a few drivers short officials think they’ll have enough drivers on the first day of school to pick up students on time and more drivers after the first week or two of school Other details of plans include:

The district and the company will pool staff to make sure that all routes and after-school sports meets have drivers.

“Mop-up” buses stationed around Utica will pick up any students who get missed for some reason.

Durham has several drivers expected to be cleared any day: one who took the road test on Tuesday two waiting for medical clearance and two full licensed drivers who recently applied.

The district has been able to remove 113 students from bus routes because their parents have promised to drive them.

Newly elected board member James Paul is optimistic based on Durham’s work to recruit train and license drivers its cooperation with the district’s transportation department and its monthly updates to the board.

“I believe” he said “that our students and families will see a substantial improvement in our transportation department.”

And the situation should keep getting better Durham officials stressed. Another eight to 10 drivers should be ready for the road in the next week or two Flavin said. Another 27 drivers are somewhere in the training pipeline Wester said.

The company is also still hiring to make sure it has enough substitutes and drivers for extracurricular activities.

Durham has made several changes this year that have helped it hire and retain more drivers Flavin said such as a 12.1 percent wage increase referral bonuses of between $500 and $1000 extensive advertising and publicity and a streamlined process for recruiting and training workers.

And the local Department of Motor Vehicles offices have stepped up he said to make sure candidates can get permitted and tested in a reasonable timeframe.

When Durham won the contract for the Utica schools one selling point was an app that lets parents track their child’s bus in real time. But with all the driver difficulties last year the app didn’t work.

But Durham plans on starting up its Bus Tracker app to show parents their children’s bus’ estimated time of arrival once all the routes are firmly set hopefully in October Flavin said.

The app will also help the company let parents know about any busing issues he said.

Caracas September 4 2022 (venezuelanalysis.com) – US oil giant Chevron has reportedly applied for a broader license for its Venezuela operations.

With the Venezuelan economy and the oil sector in particular under heavy unilateral sanctions from the US Treasury Department all activities involving the Caribbean nation require special permission from Washington.

Chevron has a minimal license that runs out in November allowing the company to perform maintenance on its wells but not drill process or trade in Venezuelan crude. The company was forced to wind down its operations in 2020.

According to Reuters the California-based corporation is looking for an expanded sanctions waiver that will see it take greater control in joint ventures with Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA as well as ramp up production and resume sales of Venezuelan crude.

In May Chevron received permission to hold direct talks with PDVSA on kickstarting its activities. The two companies co-own four ventures with a total crude production capacity of about 200000 barrels per day (bpd).

Reuters claimed that the multinational oil firm is pushing for a crude-for-diluents swap that will boost production at the Petropiar crude upgrader. It also wants greater control over the ventures’ operations human resources and oil trading while using sales to offset a reported $3 billion owed by PDVSA.

The revamped operations would not involve changing the stakeholding structure at the joint enterprises. Chevron has between 25 and 40 percent shares in its Venezuela ventures while the country’s legislation demands that PDVSA be the majority shareholder in all oil projects.

For its part Caracas has stated that “the ball is in the US’ court” concerning an expansion of Chevron’s activities.

“We are ready. We have discussed and agreed with them everything related to the immediate restitution of operations. But it no longer depends on us” Venezuelan Oil Minister Tareck El Aissami said in a press conference.

Since 2017 Washington has levied a string of measures against the Venezuelan oil sector including financial sanctions an oil embargo and secondary sanctions. The US Treasury Department also blocked swap agreements while targeting and threatening international agents against dealing with the South American country.

The wide-reaching sanctions triggered a collapse of the country’s oil output which went from 1.9 million bpd before the 2017 measures all the way down to historic lows under 400000 bpd in the second half of 2020. Production bounced back but has been stuck around 700000 bpd for several months.

Both the Trump and Biden administrations have ignored widespread condemnation of the economic blockade. Multilateral organizations UN human rights rapporteurs solidarity groups and even US Democrat House members have called on the White House to undo the measures that have been classed as “collective punishment.”

However the global energy crisis triggered by the conflict in Ukraine saw Biden reengage with the Maduro administration.

Administration officials have claimed Washington is looking to encourage the Venezuelan government to re-open talks with the hardline opposition.

Redmond was in Detroit on Friday to meet with local union officials and to prepare for the kickoff of the AFL-CIO’s new Permission to Dream program later this month. Redmond who has an extensive work history in the steel industry said what he observes right now is unlike anything he has seen previously in the labor movement.

“I never remember a moment like this” said Redmond. “What is happening is very organic and at a grassroots level. Workers are independently standing up and we embrace that but we are also here to assist them and guide them through the process.”

The AFL-CIO is a voluntary federation of 57 national and international labor unions representing more than 12.5 million workers. Redmond said that number is growing in part due to the unionization of workers in industries that have been traditionally non-union. Retail restaurant and healthcare are just three areas where unions have experienced a surge of popularity.

Last month a Lansing Chipotle Mexican Grill became the first of the chain’s 3000 locations to unionize. Earlier this year 10 Michigan Starbucks locations — including one in Clinton Township — voted to unionize joining more than 130 Starbucks nationwide whose workers have organized.

“Throughout the COVID pandemic workers in many industries realized they were the cog in the wheel that was driving business” said Redmond. “During the pandemic grocery workers were treated as essential workers but once we started moving back toward normality workers were being treated as if they were expendable. Workers have realized that the best way for them to have a voice is through collective action.”

Workers are not just seeking higher wages they are concerned about workplace safety and work/life balance as well.

“What is driving this movement is that workers are feeling disrespected” said Redmond. “People are working an enormous amount of hours. We have teachers who feel threatened at work. Workers are at the point where they are fed up and are resigning in huge numbers. They’re not just looking for sufficient wages but things like child care paid leave and a consistent schedule.”

Redmond said the AFL-CIO is also working to bring workers from the alternative energy sector into the organized labor fold.

“There has been an expansion of wind turbine energy and solar power industries because of the effort to reduce emissions” said Redmond. “These industries tend to pay low wages and have limited benefits and we would like to see the expansion of the union in these industries.”

He noted the UAW is working to establish its footprint in the electric vehicle industry as that becomes a bigger piece of the automotive industry as a whole.

“The UAW is at the table making progress and figuring out how they are going to operate in the future” said Redmond.

He has been disappointed by the extreme push back received from some businesses where workers are trying to organize unions. In his mind companies that do that misunderstand the goal of unions.

“Collaboration is powerful and I think a lot of companies are missing the point” said Redmond. “It is not our mission to destroy jobs or destroy the company profit margin it is about workers having a voice. When we have a voice we accomplish things.

“Both sides can sit down and discuss safety on the job and fair pay and fair work schedules in a way that is going to be sustainable for both the employee and the company.”

While disagreements between organized labor and employers are not unusual compromise happens at the bargaining table.

“We may disagree on some issues but we share the goal of making sure the company is profitable enough to provide good jobs to the community” said Redmond. “The resistance we are seeing to organized labor from some companies particularly in the retail sector I believe to be related to corporate greed.”

Later this month Redmond will be back in Detroit to kick off the AFL-CIO’s Permission to Dream program that helps high school seniors have access to apprenticeship opportunities with local unions. There will be apprenticeships available for future plumbers electricians millwrights just to name a few.

Permission to Dream is meant to help raise the high school graduation rate for minorities by offering an alternative to costly traditional college education. The average rate of high school graduation for Black students in the United States is 77.5% compared to 89.2% for White students and 93.6% for Asian students.

“It is about putting students on a career path especially those in certain communities where they have felt locked out” said Redmond.

Redmond was elected to his position in June 2022 and is the highest ranking Black officer in the history of the American labor movement. AFL-CIO President Liz Schuler is the first female leader of the organization.

“I’m excited about the future and the direction of the labor movement” said Redmond. “We are trying to recognize the realities of diversity in the work force and help everyone find their voice in the movement.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlYnJhZy5jb20va2V2aW4tYmFjb24tam9pbnMtdmlyYWwtaXRzLWNvcm4tdHJlbmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kevin Bacon joins viral 'It's Corn' trend,"Kevin Bacon has added some star power to the viral ‘It’s Corn’ phenomenon picking up his guitar for a… corny… rendition of the song.

In a video posted to Instagram the actor performed an acoustic cover of the song soulfully singing the annoyingly catchy lyrics while strumming his guitar with a corn on the cob.

Bacon finishes the song taking a bite of the corn saying “It’s corn.”

The ‘It’s Corn’ phenomenon began with web channel Recess Therapy interviewing a kid called Tariq about his favourite food.

The interview contained many meme-worthy quips from the six-year-old.

Soon enough The Gregory Brothers’ Songify This made Tariq go even more viral by turning his interview into a catchy song.

The meme-making quips have soundtracked over 400000 TikTok videos. The official music video released last Sunday has already had over 2.1 million views on YouTube.

Watch the official ‘It’s Corn’ music video:

“For me I really like corn” Tariq says in the video.

“What do you like about corn?” host Julian Shapiro-Barnum asks.

“It’s corn! A big lump with knobs… it has the juice” Tariq explains. “I can’t imagine a more beautiful thing.”

The song has gone so viral in fact the official TikTok account of TikTok has changed it’s bio to read “it’s CORN.”

It isn’t the first time the Gregory Brothers have taken a viral moment and made it musical.

The family band of Michael Evan Sarah Fullen and Andrew Gregory are responsible for some of the biggest viral songs of the past decade.

Their ‘Bed Intruder Song’ which featured a news interview with Antoine Dodson ended up becoming the most watched YouTube video of 2010.

NPR explored the group’s continued success this week.

“I think our videos are really about finding amazing moments on the Internet and celebrating them and amplifying them” Andrew Gregory said. “They’re about highlighting other people’s interviews original words. And I think that is what has given our videos staying power.”

Tariq has even lent his viral power to Mexican grill chain Chipotle who created their most popular ad yet starring the “corn kid”.",,,,,,

A centuries-old church in Germany drew more than 1200 people on Sunday for worship services featuring the music of Taylor Swift.

The Church of the Holy Spirit a famous church in Heidelberg that meets in a 600-year-old building put on a service titled ""Anti-Hero — Taylor Swift Church Service"" over the weekend in an effort to draw the interest of young people according to Deutsche Welle (DW).

""The Church of the Holy Spirit has always been a place of encounter and exchange. That's why a pop-music religious service fits so perfectly"" Pastor Christof Ellsiepen told the outlet. ""With it we are giving space to the questions and issues that occupy the younger generation.""

The service focused on the supposedly strong Christian themes in Swift's music that address hot-button issues such as women's rights racism and gender equality according to the pastor.

Parish Pastor Vincenzo Petracca acknowledged that Swift has taken flak from some Evangelical faith leaders for her music especially in the United States.

""Theologically speaking she points to the justness of God"" Petracca said adding that Swift's ""faith knows doubt and inner-conflict.""

""For her faith and action are inseparable"" he said.

Two Sunday services in the historic church featured Swift's tunes which DW noted were attended by an audience that skewed young and female. A rainbow banner behind the musicians noted that the church welcomes ""all sizes all [colors] all cultures all sexes all beliefs all religions all ages all types all people.""

While noting that the church was ""built for Gregorian liturgical music and not for Taylor Swift"" Petracca maintained that he was moved by the response to the modern pop-themed service.

""I stared into beaming faces — and during the song that Taylor wrote for her cancer-stricken mother many had tears in their eyes"" he said referring to the song ""Soon You'll Get Better.""

Swift's latest album released last month drew criticism from some Christian critics who claimed it features lyrical content that mocks God and Christians.

Shane Pruitt who serves as National Next Gen director for the Southern Baptist Convention's North American Mission Board and co-author of Calling Out the Called urged parents to seriously reconsider allowing their children to listen to Swift's music.

""I'm definitely not the minister or parent that has the 'no secular music' stance"" Pruitt wrote in a Facebook post. ""Also I fully realize unbelievers are going to act like unbelievers. HOWEVER there is a difference between being secular and being ANTI-CHRISTIAN.""

Former Boyzone star Shane Lynch recently accused Swift of implementing hidden satanic rituals in her sold-out shows.

“I think when you’re looking at a lot of the artists out there a lot of their stage shows are satanic rituals live in front of 20000 people without them realizing and recognizing” Lynch told Ireland’s Sunday World.

“You’ll see a lot of hoods up and masks on and fire ceremonies. Even down to Taylor Swift — one of the biggest artists in the world — you watch one of her shows and she has two or three different demonic rituals to do with the pentagrams on the ground to do with all sorts of stuff on her stage. … But to a lot of people it’s just art and that’s how people are seeing it unfortunately"" Lynch said.

In late 2021 Germany's Federal Statistical Office found that for the first time in recorded history less than half of the country's population are members of the two major historical German churches according to Le Monde.

Both the Roman Catholic Church and the various Protestant denominations in Germany have hemorrhaged members in recent decades with the Sunday worship attendance rate hovering at 4.3% for Catholics and around 3% for Protestants.

The Church of the Holy Spirit which was built between 1398 and 1515 draws millions of tourists annually.

Heidelberg is notable in the history of Christianity for being the city where the Heidelberg Catechism was first published in 1563. The Protestant Calvinist confessional document forms the doctrinal basis for many Reformed denominations and influenced the divines who drafted the Westminster Shorter Catechism which is foundational to Presbyterianism.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi90YXlsb3Itc3dpZnQtc2VydmljZS1maWxscy1nZXJtYW4tY2h1cmNoL2EtNjkwNTg2ODjSAUlodHRwczovL2FtcC5kdy5jb20vZW4vdGF5bG9yLXN3aWZ0LXNlcnZpY2UtZmlsbHMtZ2VybWFuLWNodXJjaC9hLTY5MDU4Njg4?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Taylor Swift service fills German church,"A 600-year-old church in southern Germany may not be the place one would expect to hear Taylor Swift songs but that is what happened Sunday. Some 1200 people attended the unexpectedly emotional gathering.

Heidelberg's famous Church of the Holy Spirit a 600-year-old edifice in the town's historic city center was the scene of an unusual religious service on Sunday where some 1200 congregants came together to pray and contemplate (and enjoy) a performance of US pop star Taylor Swift's songs as part of a special liturgy.

Staged under the name ""Anti-Hero — Taylor Swift Church Service"" organizers at the Protestant church said the event was conceived to attract younger people as well as to focus on the profound religious convictions expressed in many of Swift's songs.

Swift — who was not at the service but rather on her latest European tour — was raised in the American ""Bible Belt"" and has never hidden her Christian beliefs often integrating these into her music.

This was what inspired church organizers. ""The Church of the Holy Spirit has always been a place of encounter and exchange. That's why a pop-music religious service fits so perfectly"" said Heidelberg Pastor Christof Ellsiepen. ""With it we are giving space to the questions and issues that occupy the younger generation.""

A contemplation of the gospel according to Tay-Tay

Though the idea might suggest a wild concert atmosphere it was largely one of quiet devotion.

Parish Pastor Vincenzo Petracca quoted numerous lyrics and traced Swift's biography emphasizing her attachment to and understanding of Christianity in everyday life.

Petracca acknowledged that Swift's songs are open to numerous interpretations but highlighted the strong Christian — and political — messages she integrates into her songs which address the subjects of women's rights racism and gender equality among others.

The pastor noted however that such topics have made Swift the object of criticism in conservative Christian circles especially among Evangelicals in the US who have branded her ""anti-Christian.""

Swift herself has chastised ""hypocritical faith"" that puts dogma before people. The pastor emphasized as well that ""her faith knows doubt and inner-conflict.""

""Theologically speaking she points to the justness of God"" says Petracca adding ""For her faith and action are inseparable.""

A congregation moved to tears and dancing in their pews

Throughout both Sunday services — two were staged in order to accommodate the large number of people who attended — the congregation which was notably younger and and more female than is often the case were treated to live performances of six Swift songs.

These were performed by Tine Weichmann — a singer from Hamburg and now a professor of popular church music in Heidelberg — and her band. Behind them a rainbow-colored sign reading ""Everybody is welcome!""

One of the most emotionally stirring moments of the service came when Weichmann and her band performed ""Soon You'll Get Better."" Swift wrote the song for her mother who had been diagnosed with cancer.

The lyrics she penned speak to desperation and the healing powers of medicine — and of prayer: ""Holy orange bottles each night I pray to you / Desperate people find faith so now I pray to Jesus too.""

Pastor Petracca who admitted the Church of the Holy Spirit was ""built for Gregorian liturgical music and not for Taylor Swift"" said of the service ""I stared into beaming faces — and during the song that Taylor wrote for her cancer-stricken mother many had tears in their eyes.""

But no Swift-themed service would be complete without an uplifting communal outburst of joy which is exactly what happened when the band struck up the concluding hymn ""Shake It Off!"" This brought the entire congregation to their feet singing and dancing before breaking into furious applause.

""Anti-Hero"" was just the latest in a series of ""City Church Rock 'n' Pop"" services started in 2015.

This June the Church of the Holy Spirit has invited guests from across Europe to take part in a street dance service that will be held at the same time as its ""Church Battle"" dance competition.

It was Hanlon himself who had brought Uehlein back to the church in 1999 after years of spiritual distance. On the day of Hanlon's funeral Uehlein sat in the front pew of the church and listened to the bell choir which he would normally direct. Six Jesuit priests concelebrated Mass and the parish was packed with friends and relatives. When the choir played a Celtic tune called ""Pulling Bracken"" Uehlein got up and sat back with the choir in the position that would have fallen to Hanlon to play his partner's part. At the end of the funeral a piece of disco music blasted into the church and all the attendees erupted in heartfelt applause as Hanlon's coffin was carried out Uehlein told NCR. ""He brought me to St. Francis Xavier at a time when I was probably in one of the darkest periods of my life. Not sure where I was headed not even living at home I was living in a halfway house"" said Uehlein.""That funeral was a true celebration of life.""

Until the group ceased to exist in 2006 both Uehlein and Hanlon were active members of St. Francis Xavier's ""Gonzaga Group"" which gathered dozens of LGBTQ parishioners with HIV/AIDS for more than 10 years to offer spiritual support. Even today to the left of the parish's main altar there is a smaller altar consecrated as a memorial for all those who have died of the disease dedicated to the Jesuit St. Aloysius Gonzaga who for the Catholic Church is the patron saint of young people and of AIDS patients and caregivers. In an account on the Outreach website leadership of the parish's gay and lesbian ministries said that in 1986 St. Francis Xavier was the first Catholic parish in the country to hold a memorial service for a man who had died of AIDS. Over the past 40 years since it has stood out among others in the New York Archdiocese for its pastoral activities aimed at LGBTQ parishioners' inclusion its constant liturgical and eucharistic renewal to make the sacraments more accessible to everyone and its mission to fight racism poverty hunger and homelessness.

The parish has more than 20 different ministries outreach and faith formation programs — ranging from environmental protection to racial justice from Ignatian spiritual direction to the practice of yoga for meditating at church. Its motto is simply ""All are welcome.""

""I have taken full liberty of the phrase in the general instruction in the Roman Missal where it says 'When local customs dictate' "" said Uehlein who today still serves as director of music ministries. He said being constantly prepared for a spiritual music repertoire that uniquely accompanies all the different groups and ministries in the parish as ""a really tricky line to walk."" ""The important thing is to be able to keep the music in a balanced way so that the universal liturgy of the church is not lost"" he said. He listed some of the most important music dance and readings programs he has created in recent years such as ""Songs for Peace"" which began after the beginning of the war in Syria in 2012 and ""Songs for the Earth"" which was started in 2007 and then repeated every year to raise awareness about environmental care along with the local environmental ministries of the parish.

Like Ulhein John Weber a 68-year-old member and coordinator of the Gay Catholics group at the church landed at the parish in the late 1990s. ""Maybe this is a home that I could belong to"" he recalled thinking after reading a New York Times article about the 1986 memorial for the AIDS victim.

During his first few Masses there Weber said he felt comfortable only sitting in the back of the church until after a few weeks he decided to pluck up his courage and sign up in November 1998 for a retreat for gay and lesbian parishioners held in upstate New York. About 40 people attended.

""There was a full gamut of people on that retreat who were striving for something more than what the church was able to offer"" he said adding that after the retreat his faith kept growing toward a ""direction of service."" Through the parish's Gay Catholic ministry Weber writes letters to U.S. dioceses to tell them about their activities and to raise awareness about welcoming LGBTQ people into the Catholic Church. In June 1994 both the Gay Catholics ministry and the Catholic Lesbians ministry first took part in the New York City Pride Parade waving a large yellow parish banner. Xavier was the first Catholic parish to march under its name in the parade the Outreach post recalled engaging in evangelization and outreach. Since that event Xavier has participated annually in the march pausing only during the COVID-19 pandemic. St. Francis Xavier is also a supporter of AIDS Walk NY a march held once a year in May in Central Park to raise funds to support HIV prevention and treatment in underrepresented communities. ""Since Good Friday the Catholic Church has been proclaiming the Gospels of 'Seeing and Being Seen.' Until HIV and AIDS are eradicated those living with HIV and AIDS still need to be seen and companioned"" Weber said during a post-homily reflection at a Mass at the parish on April 21.

Uncovering liturgical meaning Luz Marina Díaz the parish's director of religious education says it is ""a prophetic parish."" Since she took her role in 2007 she has so far introduced about a dozen new faith formation programs that engage children and teens of all ages as well as their parents she said.

Every first Sunday of the month St. Francis Xavier hosts a ""family Mass"" in which the pastor calls all the children to sit on the altar steps during the homily and music is provided by an intergenerational choir composed of both parents and their children. On other Sundays children may participate in a separate chapel in another Mass called ""Mass class"" in which they are free to stop the pastor at any time during the Mass to ask questions about the liturgical meaning of each gesture and word the priest carries out.

""We want them to have a kind of a robust theology and spirituality of the Eucharist"" said Jesuit Fr. James Miracky an associate pastor.

""We've had a really robust way of opening that up for people and we're really proud of that"" he said adding that adults have asked that similar initiatives be put in place for them as well. When children are busy with catechism after Masses their parents are often invited to stay in the church to take part in discussions with special guests on different topics each week such as in-depth talks on the sacrament of Eucharist a program on Pope Francis' 2015 environmental encyclical Laudato Si' and discussions about how to accept their children's gender and sexual identities. Once a month St. Francis Xavier also hosts a longer-than-usual ""contemplative Mass"" celebrated by Jesuit Fr. Ricardo Da Silva another associate pastor in which attendees are free to move meditate and pray in silence in multiple spaces of the church.

Díaz who also sits on the parish's interreligious committee said that despite her church's generous openings as a woman she has her own ""struggles"" with the church.

""I would like to be a deacon"" she said. ""I prepare parents and godparents of children to be baptized; I am the person here who organizes and schedules the baptisms so I go through all the process. The only thing that I need is the ordination to be able to baptize though the Catechism of the Catholic Church says that in case of emergency anyone can baptize. I would like to have that to complete the process of such a wonderful sacrament. Like me there are many other women here that are doing many things that deacons do."" Women's participation in the life of the church was one of the most widely debated topics during the parish's meetings for the local consultations of the ongoing synod on synodality. After their discussions the parish produced a report that was later sent to both the New York Archdiocese and the Vatican. ""One parent said in exasperation 'My daughter can be an astronaut or a doctor. But she can't give a homily at church' "" the section of the report focusing on women in the church reads. ""Another participant called the exclusion of women as priests and deacons — and the subsequent sacrifice of the insight derived from their lived experience — as a 'deep loss for every practicing Catholic.' ""

Seeing humanity On March 24 Palm Sunday a 76-year-old homeless Vietnam War veteran died suddenly of a heart attack in a subway train car in downtown New York. When police officers tried to search for documents in his jacket to identify him they could only find a piece of paper with two names and two phone numbers on it. One was that of Ralph Martin a longtime volunteer at the soup kitchen that is held every Sunday at St. Francis Xavier and another was that of Roxanne De La Torre director of outreach at Xavier Mission. Xavier Mission is a nonprofit organization that in 2012 became independent from the Church of St. Francis Xavier where about 40 years ago a group of parishioners had decided to open a soup kitchen to help with hunger and homelessness in the neighborhood. Although today it is no longer part of the parish Xavier Mission still operates in the parish offices and relies both on volunteers from other ministries in the parish and on occasional volunteers coming from other parishes in New York. According to the 2023 Xavier Mission's Impact Report thanks to government grants donations and more the organization provided clean clothes to more than 1000 guests served about 42000 meals every Sunday and donated another 60000 groceries to citizens in need that year.

By Lisa Zengarini

The Pontifical Urban University in Rome is to hold an international conference on May 21 to mark the centenary of the First Council of China in Shanghai in 1924.

Entitled “100 years since the Concilium Sinense: between history and present"" the event will turn the spotlight back on that milestone event which set the foundations of the inculturation process of the Catholic Church in China to understand its scope and relevance for the Church and its apostolic work today in the context of globalization.

The First Council of China and the process of inculturation of the Church

The Shanghai Council convened from May 15 to June 12 1924 gathering all the bishops of country under the direction of the first Apostolic Delegate in China Archbishop Celso Costantini with the mandate to implement Pope Benedict XV’s ’Maximum Illud’ Apostolic Letter reaffirming that Christ ""is not foreign to any nation"" and that becoming a Christian does not imply abandoning loyalty to one’s people and “submitting to the pretensions and domination of a foreign power.”

In light of that historic papal document considered to be the “Magna Charta” of contemporary Catholic missions the Council gave detailed provisions to encourage the indigenization of the Chinese Church by entrusting its dioceses and parishes to native bishops and priests counteracting the colonial mentality that had also penetrated ecclesial practices.

Programme of the conference

Keynote speakers at the conference organized in collaboration with Fides Agency and the Vatican Commission for the Church in China will include Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin Cardinal Luis Antonio G. Tagle Pro-Prefect of the Dicastery for Evangelization and the Bishop of Shanghai Giuseppe Shen Bin.

Academics and researchers from the People's Republic of China will also give speeches including Professor Zheng Xiaoyun and Professor Liu Guopeng of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

The conference will opened by a video message from Pope Francis.

The new canned cocktail was developed using Mazunte’s classic margarita recipe using Karrikin’s Blaze which is fermented and distilled locally from 100 percent Blue Weber agave nectar imported from Jalisco Mexico. It also features Karrikin’s homemade Triple Sec.

“We had been discussing and exploring the best way to grow our brand by finding a way to offer our margarita outside of our brick-and-mortar locations” says John Johnston chief financial officer of Mazunte Taqueria Mazunte Centro and Mazunte Catering. “This is difficult with us not being a distiller or alcohol distributor.”

Enter Jeff Hunt from Karrikin. The Fairfax-based craft distillery’s cofounder Johnston and Josh Wamsley Mazunte’s chief executive officer put their heads together to bring the product to fruition. The result is an elevated product with better ingredients Johnston notes.

“We hope this product is an extension of our brand through retail outlets with a new product offering to our current and new customers” he adds. “[And] the nice part for them is they have an immediate large customer in us with our two restaurant locations.”

The canned margarita will be sold as a four pack of 12-ounce cans for a suggested retail price of $13.99. Karrikin and Ohio Valley Wine & Beer will act as distributors to retail outlets.

You can celebrate the release with the Mazunte crew this weekend during a release party from 2 to 10 p.m. on Saturday Sept. 10 at Karrikin Spirits (3717 Jonlen Dr. Fairfax). In addition Mazunte will have a pop-up “mercado” for guests to take home tostada chips salsas guacamole meats and produce.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzA0L3doby13YXMtYmVkLWJhdGgtYmV5b25kcy1jZm8tZ3VzdGF2by1hcm5hbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Who was Bed Bath & Beyond's Gustavo Arnal: Exec worked for companies across globe,"The top-level Bed Bath & Beyond executive who apparently jumped off a Tribeca high-rise was a well-regarded businessman whose career spanned the globe before his sudden death on Friday.

Gustavo Arnal was hired by Bed Bath & Beyond in May 2020 and credited with helping get the New Jersey-based retail giant through the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic the company said in a statement Sunday.

The exec came aboard as chief financial officer and executive vice president after “a distinguished global career in finance” that included working at “several other well-known businesses” the company stated Sunday.

Arnal came from cosmetic company Avon where he was also named the executive vice president and CFO starting in spring 2019 according to the Cincinnati Business Courier. He was at Walgreens Boots Alliance before that serving as senior vice president and CFO of international divisions and global functions the Business Courier said.

Both of those gigs were based in London.

But most of his career was at Procter & Gamble where he spent 20 years holding various positions and working with brand names including Pringles potato chips and Tide detergent.

The husband and father of two adult daughters was CFO of the company’s India Middle East and Africa business where he oversaw operations in more than 50 countries the Cleveland Business Journal reported in May 2020.

When Arnal was announced as Bed Bath & Beyond’s newest hire he said the company had to build “on the strong foundations of this business with a new robust and sustainable business model” the Cleveland Business Journal reported.

He also reportedly said he looked forward to working as a “catalyst for the cultural and financial change in the business.”

But the housewares company has struggled mightily recently and is expected to close 150 stores and terminate 20% of its workforce after an announcement about its restructuring came days before his death.

Arnal was also included in a recent lawsuit that accuses him Chewy.com founder Ryan Cohen and others of artificially inflating the retail’s share price.

The class action was filed Aug. 23 in Washington DC.

The company’s board of directors chairman Harriet Edelman said in part of a statement Sunday about the shocking death “Our focus is on supporting his family and his team and our thoughts are with them during this sad and difficult time. Please join us in respecting the family’s privacy.”

Bila seorang hamba tak bisa berhati-hati dalam menyikapi harta dan anak-anaknya yang sejatinya semata-mata merupakan titipan dari Allah SWT maka akan mendatangkan bencana. Tidak sedikit manusia karena cintanya yang berlebihan kepada harta dan anaknya hingga berani melanggar ketentuan dalam agama.

Allah berfirman dalam Alquran surat At Tagabun ayat 15

اِنَّمَآ اَمْوَالُكُمْ وَاَوْلَادُكُمْ فِتْنَةٌ ۗوَاللّٰهُ عِنْدَهٗٓ اَجْرٌ عَظِيْمٌ

Sesungguhnya hartamu dan anak-anakmu hanyalah cobaan (bagimu) dan di sisi Allah pahala yang besar.

Memiliki harta banyak sebenarnya akan mendatangkan ujian dan bencana lebih besar. Bila manusia dapat menggunakan hartanya dengan maslahat yakni untuk menggapai keridhaan Allah niscaya harta tersebut akan menyelamatkannya. Sedang bila harta yang dimiliki justru digunakan untuk maksiat pada Allah maka harta itu akan menjadi bencana baik di dunia maupun di akhirat.

Allah berfirman dalam surat Al Alaq:

كَلَّآ اِنَّ الْاِنْسَانَ لَيَطْغٰىٓ ۙ ٦ اَنْ رَّاٰهُ اسْتَغْنٰىۗ ٧

Sekali-kali tidak. Sungguh manusia itu benar-benar melampaui batas apabila melihat dirinya serba cukup. (AlAlaq 6-7)

Dalam sebuah hadits disebutkan

إِنَّ لِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ فِتْنَـةً وَإِنَّ فِتْنَـةَ أُمَّتِيْ اَلْمَالُ. (رواه أحمد والترمذي والطبراني والحاكم عن كعب بن عياض)

Sesungguhnya bagi tiap-tiap umat ada cobaan dan sesungguhnya cobaan umatku (yang berat) ialah harta (HR Aḥmad AT Tirmizi At Tabrani Hakim dari Ka'ab bin Iyad)

Kalau manusia dapat menahan diri tidak akan berlebihan cintanya kepada harta dan anaknya jika cintanya kepada Allah lebih besar daripada cintanya kepada yang lain maka ia akan mendapat pahala yang besar dan berlipat ganda.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YWJsb2lkYmludGFuZy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvZmlsbS10di1tdXNpay9zaW5vcHNpcy9yZWFkLzE3NzUzNi9rb2xhYm9yYXNpLWlrYXRhbi1jaW50YS1kYW4tY2ludGEtZml0cmktbGFoaXJrYW4tdGFrZGlyLWNpbnRhLXlhbmcta3VwaWxpaNIBmQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YWJsb2lkYmludGFuZy5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGVzL2ZpbG0tdHYtbXVzaWsvc2lub3BzaXMvcmVhZC8xNzc1MzYva29sYWJvcmFzaS1pa2F0YW4tY2ludGEtZGFuLWNpbnRhLWZpdHJpLWxhaGlya2FuLXRha2Rpci1jaW50YS15YW5nLWt1cGlsaWg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kolaborasi Ikatan Cinta dan Cinta Fitri Lahirkan Takdir Cinta Yang Kupilih,"TABLOIDBINTANG.COM - SCTV kembali menghadirkan sinetron baru produksi Sinemart. Menempati slot Buku Harian Seorang Istri Takdir Cinta Yang Kupilih yang tayang mulai Senin (5/9) lahir dari kolaborasi antara penulis sinetron Ikatan Cinta hingga episode 600 Donna Rosamayna dan sutradara sinetron Cinta Fitri Encep Masduki.

Donna Rosamayna kembali ke Sinemart setelah melanglangbuana dari satu rumah produksi ke rumah produksi lain. Setelah sukses mengantar Ikatan Cinta menjadi sinetron nomor satu selama 15 tahun Donna pulang ke rumah asal.

Bersama sutradara sinetron Cinta Fitri Encep Masduki Donna menghasilkan karya berjudul Takdir Cinta Yang Kupilih (sebelumnya Ta'aruf Cinta). Sederet bintang ternama digaet untuk memainkan karakter yang telah dibuat Donna. Sebut saja Alisia Rininta (Novia) Jonathan Frizzy (Hakim) Dinda Kirana (Tammy) dan Randy Pangalila (Jeffry).

""Mereka sebenarnya bukan orang baru (di sinetron). Apalagi mas Ijonk. Saya rasa dia duluan jadi pemain sinetron daripada saya jadi penulis sinetron hahaha. Karena jam terbang mereka tinggi saya rasa mereka pasti bisa memerankan karakter mereka masing-masing"" jelas Donna dalam wawancara virtual Sabtu (3/9).

""Di lokasi juga ada bang Encep dimana dia men-deliver dari skenario menuju gambar. Gimana dia membentuk karakter dari Novia dan Hakim"" sambungnya.

Donna menegaskan Takdir Cinta Yang Kupilih sama sekali berbeda dari sinetron Ikatan Cinta. ""Ini beda ya jangan disamain. Karena background-nya sama-sama menikah tanpa cinta ada yang bilang ini Ikatan Cinta ini Terpaksa Menikahi Tuan Muda. Aduh enggak. Hakim bukan Aldebaran. Novia juga bukan Andin"" kata Donna.

Donna sejauh ini mengaku puas dan senang dengan hasil visualisasi dari skenario yang dia bikin. Akting semua pemain dipuji Donna bagus. Masing-masing pemain bisa memainkan emosi dengan baik. Sehingga penonton nanti bisa merasakan apa yang mereka rasakan.

""Mas Ijonk bagus adegan marah-marahnya bagus. Saya suka. Alisia juga begitu. Saat nangis bukan yang kayak lebay. Tapi dengan dia meneteskan air mata aja penonton sudah ter-deliver rasa sakit dia gimana"" terang Donna.

Donna menyebut Takdir Cinta beda dari karya-karya dia sebelumnya. Ini untuk kali pertama Donna menulis sinetron bergenre full drama keluarga dan persahabatan.

""Konfliknya ini tentang kesetiaan komitmen persahabatan. Gimana sih sebenarnya sahabat. Sahabat itu akan bahagia kalau sahabatnya bahagia. Dia akan sedih kalau sahabatnya sedih. Itu sih yang mau saya angkat dari sini"" jelas Donna.

The latest IT Labs donated by Commercial Bank

The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has extended the reach of its national IT education initiative to encompass five more government teaching institutions to which the bank recently donated fully equipped IT labs and where necessary conducted building renovations.



The latest beneficiaries of the bank’s flagship corporate social responsibility programme are the Kudagammana Maha Vidyalaya in Walpita Karunarathna College in Kotadeniyawa Thawalampitiya Maha Vidyalaya and Henepola Vidyaloka Vidyalaya in Mirigama and the Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka (VTA) in Rajagiriya.

The bank’s donations included computers and chairs printers and multimedia projectors. In addition the bank also invested in the renovation and expansion of the existing IT lab facilities at some of these institutions.



While the schools cater to students from grades 1to 13 and require IT labs to teach ICT which is a compulsory subject in the curriculum the VTA needed 10 new computers to ensure the continuation of the twice-weekly computer courses currently conducted for 30 students.



Beside steadfastly continuing with the donation of fully-equipped IT labs the bank which is one of the largest contributors towards IT education in Sri Lankaalso supporteda project to set up 100 classrooms that focus on the STEM subjects and is funding projects to set up math labs in schools and to enhance vocational training opportunities for students that do not qualify for higher education.



Additionally Commercial Bank is funding a 150-hour IT hardware course conducted in collaboration with the Academy for ICT Skills and Development and CISCO Networking Academy in selected schools. While the CISCO Networking Academy provides the course fee free-of-charge for the students the bank sponsors the lecture fee of the course. The bank has also supported the ‘IT Essentials-Instructor’ certificate course for teachers at the CISCO Networking Centre at the University of Moratuwa under this programme.",,,,,,

One of the programs will get credit cards to those without credit scores and the other will assist small businesses with minority women or veteran owners to get credit. Participation in Project REACh is a part of Citigroup’s $1 billion in strategic initiatives to help close the racial wealth gap and increase economic mobility in the United States according to the company’s press release.

Project REACh already works with several banks like JPMorgan Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp sharing bank account data to approve more borrowers for credit cards.

The issue of the credit-underserved is a big one in the U.S. with around 50 million residents lacking traditional credit scores. Banks usually look at credit scores when reviewing applications for various kinds of consumer debt.

The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) wrote that information about an applicant’s income and spending habits can be as good a measure of creditworthiness as traditional credit scores.

Efforts to help the underserved have cropped up elsewhere recently including the White House debut of a new Economic Opportunity Coalition (EOC) to look at economic disparities PYMNTS wrote.

The coalition will look into investments for communities of color while the Biden-Harris administration will also invest. The EOC will be working between public private and social sector organizations to marshal and direct resources.

The areas of focus will include investing in community development financial institutions (CDFIs) and minority depository institutions (MDIs) supporting entrepreneurs and minority-owned businesses more access to credit and better infrastructure and housing for underserved neighborhoods.

The goal of the Biden-Harris administration is to “help communities recover address inequities made worse by the pandemic and provide more pathways to economic growth for historically underserved communities.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sYXRlc3RseS5jb20vc29jaWFsbHkvd29ybGQvZnJvbS1icmVha2luZ3ZpZXdzLXJlY2tpdHQtY2Vvcy1leGl0LWNvdWxkLW9wZW4tdXAtdGhlLWRvb3ItZm9yLW1hLWJ1dC1iaWRkZXJzLWxhdGVzdC10d2VldC1ieS1yZXV0ZXJzLTQxNTk0NjMuaHRtbC9hbXDSAZ8BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGF0ZXN0bHkuY29tL3NvY2lhbGx5L3dvcmxkL2Zyb20tYnJlYWtpbmd2aWV3cy1yZWNraXR0LWNlb3MtZXhpdC1jb3VsZC1vcGVuLXVwLXRoZS1kb29yLWZvci1tYS1idXQtYmlkZGVycy1sYXRlc3QtdHdlZXQtYnktcmV1dGVycy00MTU5NDYzLmh0bWwvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From @Breakingviews: Reckitt CEO's Exit Could Open Up the Door for M&A.

A little over 5.5% is with the public.At Friday's closing price of ₹285.35 on the BSE  the Centre's stake in HZL is worth more than ₹35600 crore.""We have appointed investment bankers and the appointment of the legal adviser will be complete by this month and we already have the necessary approvals to go ahead"" the official said.DIPAM on Thursday issued a request for proposal for the engagement of a legal adviser for its HZL stake sale. The bids have to be submitted by September 16. The department aims to commence the disinvestment process by the month end.Last month the Centre appointed five investment bankers - ICICI Securities Axis Capital  Citigroup Global Markets HDFC Bank and IIFL Securities - to manage the stake sale. The Union Cabinet approved the stake sale in May this year.The Centre has a ₹65000 crore disinvestment target this year and a successful HZL divestment can help meet the target since it has already raised ₹24544 crore in FY23.A delay in the strategic sale of Pawan Hans Shipping Corporation of India BEML and IDBI Bank  and less-than-expected public offer of Life Insurance Corporation of India had forced the government to fix the focus on HZL.

That album’s somber “Hey” was a beautiful moment of reflection before the punkish brawl of “Me and My Friends” the oldest Chilis song of the night and one of only two that came from an album Frusciante didn’t play on.

Origins aside Frusciante was clearly the MVP of this production — even his off-the-cuff version of Elton John’s “Your Song” was lovely — and as such had his own cheering section in the stage left corner of the crowd.

While the regular season is still far from over the playoff picture in the National League is mostly wrapped up. The Mets Braves Dodgers and Cardinals are all but certain to earn a postseason berth and the Phillies Padres and Brewers are fighting for the final two spots.

In order for Philadelphia to make the playoffs they only have to outplay one of those two teams. And thankfully they already have a pretty big edge on the competition: the tiebreaker.

When Major League Baseball introduced the third Wild Card spot ahead of the 2022 season the league eliminated its one-game tiebreaker format.



With more postseason games to play there is no longer time to allow for tiebreaker contests. Instead if there is any sort of tie after 162 games are up it will be resolved using the teams' head-to-head records against one another.

The Phillies have already finished their season series against both the Padres and the Brewers and they came out on top in each one. They have the better head-to-head record against both of their closest Wild Card competitors.

Philadelphia dropped two games to Milwaukee in mid-April but swept the Brewers six weeks later in a three-game set at American Family Field. They won the season series four games to two.

Similarly they welcomed the Padres to Citizens Bank Park in May and lost two of three. When the Phillies journeyed to San Diego the following month however they won three of four taking the season series four games to three.

This means Philadelphia essentially has a one-game cushion in the Wild Card race. In the case of a tie for the third Wild Card spot they would automatically receive a postseason berth.

In any previous year the Phillies would have to play a one-game winner-takes-all playoff for a chance at October baseball. They would have to burn their best available starting pitcher and the team would lose a day of rest too.

The new tiebreaker format therefore could wind up working out quite nicely for Philadelphia. In the case of a tie they'll stroll right into the playoffs.

The Major League Baseball season is a long one. With so many games to play it often doesn't feel like each individual game matters all that much especially those in the early months of the season.

This year however those seven games in mid-June in which Philadelphia clinched the season series against San Diego and Milwaukee could turn out to be very meaningful after all.

The Phillies have already won the tiebreaker against their two biggest threats. That's a big deal. It gives them a huge advantage and it could very well be the difference between another disappointing season for Philadelphia and their first postseason appearance in over a decade.

India is planning a massive expansion of green hydrogen production to curb its dependence on energy imports and to wean the economy off fossil fuels to meet climate targets.New Delhi is aiming for an annual production capacity of 25 million tons by 2047 according to people familiar with the plans who didn’t want to be named as the information is not yet public. However the number could change going forward depending on technology and the country’s demand outlook they said. Media officials at the power and renewable energy ministries didn’t immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.Green hydrogen is widely expected to play a major role in decarbonizing heavy industries including oil refineries steel mills and fertilizer plants. India’s current output of the fuel is very low and comes from a handful of pilot projects.While green hydrogen is regarded as a potential panacea to cut emissions there are still major challenges in scaling up the technology and making it cost-effective. It’s not certain demand growth will materialize and the fuel may not become the first choice in transport and industry.The potential to generate low-cost renewable energy in India the world’s third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases has been a driving force behind the government’s carbon-free hydrogen ambitions. India’s goal of getting to net zero by 2070 has found support from business tycoons including Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani  as well as state-run energy giants like NTPC Ltd . and Indian Oil Corp Adani has pledged to spend $70 billion on clean energy assets including green hydrogen while Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd . one of India’s most valuable companies plans to add production of solar panels electrolyzers for clean hydrogen and rechargeable batteries. French oil giant TotalEnergies SE has agreed to partner with Adani on hydrogen in India.The government is considering more ways to spur the sector including offering production-linked incentives to make electrolyzers.Green hydrogen is made by splitting hydrogen and oxygen in water with the help of electrolyzers powered by renewable electricity. The product can replace the use of hydrogen derived from some fossil fuels in refineries and fertilizer plants. It has the potential to become an alternative to coal in steel mills and oil products in long-haul transport.The green hydrogen targets are part of a broader strategy for 2047 the centenary year of India’s independence. The plan also includes measures to improve energy efficiency overhaul power markets and expand manufacturing of renewable energy equipment according to the people.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvYmhvcGFsL3NtYXJ0LWNpdHktZW5lcmd5LXNhdmluZy1iaWQtbGVhdmVzLWJob3BhbC1pbi1kYXJrL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzkzOTc3NzE5LmNtc9IBf2h0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvYmhvcGFsL3NtYXJ0LWNpdHktZW5lcmd5LXNhdmluZy1iaWQtbGVhdmVzLWJob3BhbC1pbi1kYXJrL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85Mzk3NzcxOS5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Smart city ‘energy saving’ bid leaves Bhopal in dark,BHOPAL: Some undesirable energy saving practices adopted by Bhopal Smart City Development Corporation Limited ( BSCDCL ) are leaving the state capital in the dark.

Char Imli  Shahpura Kolar are feeling the worst pinch of the tactics.Over 25% of the city roads remain in dark after sunset.The situation has gone unresolved despite a massive audit ordered into the energy saving mechanism adopted by the BSCDCL. Automated system provides a ‘live alert’ but officials seem to have turned a blindeye.“As of Friday 170 lamps failed” said BSCDCL CEO Ankit Asthana. 168 ‘lamps fails’ were cited on Saturday. Asthana did not comment on data showing 73.2% of lights on and its inference. The situation on the streets is an easier read. In many locations like BRTS stretch from New Market to Polytechnic for weeks only one side of the street is lit.Some 20000 LED street lights installed by replacing the conventional sodium lamps and mercury lamps in Bhopal. As per the RPF energy savings are be evaluated for each month. As per proposal ‘minimum guaranteed 35% saving’ is mentioned with energy saving fees sharing with ESCO. Baseline fixation and energy saving calculation is net for the private company.With monsoon leaving many roads and streets with potholes lack of proper street lights is making state capital’s road more unsafe. “It is not only an issue for drivers. Lack of street lights makes it more unsafe for women and children” said Sangeeta  an NGO worker. “Can energy savings compensative for unsafe streets?” she asked.

Jack McVey scored just before the whistle to seal a draw for the Ravens

FC Isle of Man have scraped another point in the North West Counties Football League Premier Division with home draw at the Bowl.

Playing Barnoldswick Town the Ravens set the mood with an early goal from Stephen Whitley just 5 minutes in.

Barnoldswick returned in the 22nd minute with a goal from Kuda Chingwaro but Lee Gale put the pressure back on the visitors in the 33rd minute as they went in to the break 2-1 up.

The second half Barnoldswick appeared the better side and the Ravens conceded two further goals one in the 79th minute from Barnoldswick's Gareth Hill and a second goal for Chingwaro.

Another defeat was then on the cards but in the dying minutes of extra time the Ravens Jack McVey sealed a 3-3 draw from a penalty and a point for FC Isle of Man.

SAN FRANCISCO - The cryptocurrency industry has endured a terrible year. A devastating crash wiped nearly $1 trillion from the market draining the savings of thousands of people. Several companies filed for bankruptcy.Now the industry is fixated on a potential saving grace: a long-awaited software upgrade to the most popular cryptocurrency platform ethereum  which provides the technological backbone for thousands of crypto projects. The upgrade - known as the Merge - has gained near-mythical status after years of delays that left some insiders questioning whether it would ever happen.But if all goes according to plan the Merge will take place around Sept. 15 more than eight years after it was initially discussed. The change would shift ethereum to a more energy-efficient infrastructure addressing the widespread criticism that crypto's climate effect outweighs its possible benefits. And it would lay the foundation for future upgrades to reduce the hefty fees required to conduct transactions in Ether the platform's signature currency and the second-most valuable digital asset after bitcoin.""This transition is essentially laying a road map to a future which is far more scalable far more energy efficient and a lot more usable to the normal person"" said Joseph Ayoub an analyst at Citi who has studied the Merge. ""It's laying the groundwork for adoption.""But the risks are profound. Even by crypto standards the process is almost ludicrously complicated.For months insiders have engaged in frantic jargon-heavy discussions of developments such as the Goerli Testnet Merge and the Beacon Chain's Bellatrix upgrade crucial software changes leading up to the main event. A botched Merge would imperil the thousands of crypto applications that operate using ethereum which collectively handle more than $50 billion in user funds.""It's flying the jet and changing the engine in the sky"" said Chandler Guo a crypto industry veteran who leads a group opposing the Merge. ""It's very difficult. It's very dangerous.""Ethereum is a blockchain a publicly viewable ledger on which exchanges of digital coins are recorded. Transactions on the chain are conducted in Ether.The platform was started in 2013 by a teenage programmer Vitalik Buterin who is now regarded as one of the industry's elder statesmen. Buterin wanted to create a crypto system that was more flexible than bitcoin and could instantly execute financial contracts and other complex forms of exchange.Ethereum's design allows it to support a range of financial engineering. Programmers can build applications using the software to perform more complicated tasks than simple money transfers. Thousands of businesses and projects in the experimental world of decentralized finance now use the platform to offer lending borrowing and other sophisticated investment options. Many non-fungible tokens - the unique digital collectibles known as NFTs - are built on ethereum.At its core the Merge is a change to ethereum's verification system. When someone sends money in a traditional transaction a bank serves as the middleman verifying that one person has sufficient funds to pay someone else.Crypto operates without that middleman. In this alternate financial system transactions are verified by a scattered network of computers. Anyone can plug a machine into the network by running software that solves complex puzzles an energy-guzzling process for confirming transactions. Essentially the computers are racing one another: When the puzzle is solved the winning participants are rewarded with new coins in the digital currency they are verifying.This verification process is widely known as crypto mining and has the technical name ""proof of work."" By some estimates the amount of energy consumed each year in mining is comparable to the annual emissions of entire countries.The Merge is set to shift ethereum to an alternate framework called ""proof of stake"" which requires less energy. In a proof-of-stake system computers don't burn energy racing to verify transactions. Instead crypto investors deposit a certain number of digital coins in a shared pool which enters them into a lottery. Each time an exchange happens a participant is selected from the lottery to verify the transaction and win the rewards.The shift is expected to cut ethereum's energy use by more than 99% which crypto boosters hope will make the technology more popular.""The difference in hardware and energy consumption is so significant"" said Preston Van Loon a developer working on the Merge. ""When NFTs were blowing up people were saying 'I'd love to have an NFT but it feels like I'm burning a forest down.' ""Switching to proof of stake could also help solve another of ethereum's biggest problems: the substantial fees required to use the network. Ethereum can handle only a certain amount of activity at a time so when there's demand for the platform the price of using it goes up. Anyone sending ether must pay a ""gas fee"" - a transaction charge that at times has risen as high as $200.The Merge won't eliminate that problem immediately but developers say it will lay critical groundwork for future upgrades designed to minimize fees.But a change on this scale could also make ethereum vulnerable to hacks or other disruptions some crypto experts say. ""Any time you're making changes to a complex system there must necessarily arise unintended consequences"" said Christopher Calicott a crypto venture investor.Much of the criticism is fueled at least partly by self-interest. Many of the Merge's most vocal opponents are businesses that have built expensive data centers to mine ether in the proof-of-work system.The Merge's origins date to the time of ethereum's creation. Buterin raised the possibility of switching to proof of stake in 2014 but at that point the system was untested. The most successful cryptocurrency was bitcoin which uses proof of work.Since then many newer cryptocurrencies have used proof of stake successfully. Ethereum programmers have been working in earnest on the switch for at least four years. The work is complex and progress has been slow. Engineers had to construct a new blockchain and run tests to check for security holes or other technological bugs that might disrupt the transition.A nonprofit called the Ethereum Foundation helps supervise the platform. But in reality ethereum is run by a loose group of engineers across the world; no top-down authority orchestrated the Merge. Periodically programmers get together on publicly streamed video calls to debate technical aspects of the shift.At one point the shift to proof of stake was supposed to happen as early as 2016. As the Merge came together this year crypto enthusiasts expected a June launch date. Then the Merge was pushed back to August. Now it's set for next month.In the crypto world the delays became a kind of joke. Early on engineers installed what's known as a ""difficulty bomb"" in ethereum's code. It was designed to keep them honest: After a set amount of time the bomb was to go off causing disruptions in the ethereum network unless it was switched to proof of stake. But every time the bomb was supposed to go off the engineers created a new bit of code to defuse it somewhat defeating the point.""We're not doing this lightly"" said Danny Ryan an Ethereum Foundation researcher who has worked on the platform since 2017. ""There's been countless amount of engineering and testing and academic vetting.""In December 2020 ethereum programmers took a big step toward the Merge by releasing a crypto platform called the Beacon Chain a proof-of-stake system designed to provide the foundation for an upgraded ethereum. After two years of testing the Beacon Chain is finally set to integrate with ethereum in mid-September - the merge that gives the process its name.As the Merge draws nearer companies and entrepreneurs with a financial stake in ethereum mining are growing increasingly concerned. Crypto mining has become a multibillion-dollar business dominated by publicly traded companies.In a recent corporate report Hive Blockchain a crypto mining firm that draws revenue from both bitcoin and ethereum said a switch to proof of stake ""may render our mining business less competitive or less profitable."" Hive did not respond to requests for comment.Some ethereum miners are fighting back. Guo who used to run an ethereum mining operation in China has mobilized a group of engineers who are working on an alternate currency to rival the upgraded Ether.Despite the pushback the Merge appears close to completion. A final test known as the Goerli merge was finished successfully this month.Ryan said he planned to gather in person with some colleagues to mark the actual Merge the culmination of five years of his professional life.Planning the celebration is complicated. While developers have estimated a Sept. 15 date the Merge's precise timing is uncertain and subject to complex technical factors. Any glitch could cause another delay.""This might happen at 4 in the morning. It might happen at 2 in the afternoon"" Ryan said. ""But I'll definitely be awake.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS9lbmVyZ3kvb2lsLWdhcy9wZXRyb25ldC10by1pbnZlc3QtcnMtNDAwMDAtY3JvcmUtaW4tNS15cnMvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTM5Nzk4NDkuY21z0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5L2VuZXJneS9vaWwtZ2FzL3BldHJvbmV0LXRvLWludmVzdC1ycy00MDAwMC1jcm9yZS1pbi01LXlycy9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTM5Nzk4NDkuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Petronet to invest Rs 40000 crore in 5 yrs,"Find this comment offensive?

Special to The Monroe News

The Pageant of Historic Monroe highlights many of the individuals which comprised the event’s committees and supporters. One page lists many Monroe businesses that lent either direct or indirect support to the event. One of those businesses that had success in Monroe from a variety of fronts was the Diekman Bottling Works.

Founded on March 17 1917 by a group of investors including Caspar H. Diekman William Gutmann Jacob Martin Frank Schrauder and August Weier the Diekman Bottling Works was originally located in the back of a bowling alley and pool hall at 12 South Monroe Street in Monroe and was said to be the forerunner of the Dansbuy and Augusta billiard halls. Gutmann who had also served as cashier for the First National Bank of Monroe was president of the company and Caspar Diekman was treasurer.

In Caspar Diekman’s obituary published Friday April 26 1946 it was noted that the Diekman Bottling Works’ bottling business soon needed larger quarters and on May 1 1919 the company moved to the two-story brick building at 419-425 East Front Street. Several expansions took place during subsequent years – including construction of a brick fascia-faced office building that was constructed in 1938 at the 425 East Front Street address and survives today.

The Diekman Bottling Works was known as one of the leading bottlers in the industry relative to production and distribution processes. In the 1922 edition of the Brewers Journal the Diekman firm was said to have installed a Miller Hydro Soaker manufactured by the Miller Manufacturing Company of Bainbridge Georgia. At the time it was one of the leading bottling cleaning systems in the United States. During much of the 20th century bottlers like the Diekman Bottling Works operated bottle deposit systems to reclaim used bottles and reuse them after the bottle cleaning process had been completed. The U.S. bottle deposit system operated successfully well into the early 1980's.

In 1932 Caspar Diekman became President and General Manager of the Diekman Bottling Works and moved to change the firm’s name to the Monroe Coca-Cola Bottling Company (as they began distributing both Coca-Cola and the Detroit-based Stroh’s Beer brands). Joining Caspar Diekman were his son Charles Diekman and Chester J. Clark as vice presidents and John A. Kirschner as secretary-treasurer. It was noted that Mr. Kirschner had worked for the company since 1918.

In addition to Caspar Diekman’s business activities in Monroe he was also involved in numerous cultural activities including what was originally known as the Vetter’s Brass Band (founded by John M. Vetter who came to Monroe in 1854 and ran a tannery near what was the Waterloo Mill). A men’s choir – the Maennerchoir – was an offshoot of this group.

Caspar Diekman became featured in the group – now known as the Monroe Cornet Band – in 1919. Reorganized by August H. Boehme in 1874 the Monroe Cornet Band was one of the leading performance bands in Monroe. After Caspar Diekman led the band for five years the Monroe Cornet Band once again reorganized and became the Monroe Exchange Club Band.

Following the 1938 rebranding of the Diekman Bottling Works to the Monroe Coca-Cola Bottling Company Caspar Diekman and his second wife Gertrude Clark (who was originally from Luka Mississippi) split their time between Monroe (where they resided at the Park Hotel) Florida and a cottage at Perry Lake (in Oscoda County the least populous county in lower Michigan and located in the northeast segment of Michigan’s “mit”). It was at the Perry Lake cottage that Caspar Diekman died on April 25 1946. His first wife Leona Fix of Monroe died in 1926.

TIMESOFINDIA.COM Updated: Sep 3 2022 23:29 IST IST

The colas developed marketing as a discipline and perhaps it’s this that Reliance wants to tap into. With a new generation of leaders from the business family soon to take over perhaps they feel that company could use some sprinkling of cola marketing spirit

Mukesh Ambani ’s decision to buy the Campa-Cola brand for a rumoured Rs 22 crore and relaunch it this year has been greeted as a triumph of nostalgia marketing. It gives Reliance ’s fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) portfolio a brand with strong recognition if mostly among a slightly ageing demographic. And it’s got considerable media publicity possibly because many journalists and editors are in that demographic.

Campa’s nostalgia factor has been promoted by films like Ritesh Batra’s romance Photograph (2019) where Miloni one of the leads remembers her grandfather buying her a Campa-Cola every day. But after he died and the Campa factory shut down she never touched another cola and finding her a bottle is a quest for Rafi the other protagonist.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoaXNpc21vbmV5LmNvLnVrL21vbmV5L21hcmtldHMvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMTE3NjE1NS9Db2NhLUNvbGEtYm9zcy1oYW5kZWQtMjUway1jb3N0LWxpdmluZy1wZXJrLmh0bWzSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGlzaXNtb25leS5jby51ay9tb25leS9tYXJrZXRzL2FydGljbGUtMTExNzYxNTUvYW1wL0NvY2EtQ29sYS1ib3NzLWhhbmRlZC0yNTBrLWNvc3QtbGl2aW5nLXBlcmsuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coca-Cola boss handed £250k 'cost of living' perk,"Some of Britain's richest corporate bosses are being lavished with extraordinary perks including allowances for their partners cash for booze designer clothes commuting costs and second homes The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

It was the first of many celebratory moments in Cristobal's debut game as Miami's coach.

Henry Parrish rushed for 108 yards and three touchdowns Tyler Van Dyke passed for two more scores and No. 16 Miami started its season by topping Bethune-Cookman 70-13 on Saturday. Miami rushed for seven touchdowns on the day piled up 582 yards of offense and turned three takeaways into touchdowns.

Lynne Sladky/AP Miami running back Henry Parrish Jr. runs for a first down during the first half against Bethune Cookman Saturday Sept. 3 2022 in Miami Gardens Fla.

""The goal was to be 1-0 by 7:15 tonight"" Cristobal said. ""And that was achieved. ... We did what we had to do.""

Thaddeus Franklin rushed for two scores while Devon Perry and Terrell Walden II also ran for touchdowns for the Hurricanes (1-0).

Gilbert Frierson had an interception return for a score while Xavier Restrepo and Michael Redding III caught the TD passes from Van Dyke — who completed 13 of 16 passes for 193 yards. Jake Garcia completed all eight of his passes for the Hurricanes in relief.

""Amazing to start the season like that"" Frierson said.

For Bethune-Cookman (0-1) Que'Shawn Byrd caught a 34-yard touchdown pass from Jalon Jones.

""It gives us a measuring stick for our football team"" Bethune-Cookman coach Terry Sims said. ""When you play a team the caliber of the University of Miami you have no choice but to play at your best. Our guys I thought went out and they fought.""

It was Cristobal's 12th season-opener at Miami — he had five as a player including his redshirt year then three as a graduate assistant and three more as a full-fledged assistant.

But this was the first of what Miami expects to be many with him in charge of the operation.

""The energy was through the roof"" Restrepo said. ""Coach Cristobal he carries the entire team on his shoulders.""

There was much to like: Van Dyke’s passes were crisp Parrish stepped up to lead an injury-depleted running back corps Frierson had the return touchdown Key’Shawn Smith had three kickoff returns for 184 yards — barely stepping out 17 yards from the end zone on what would have been a return score — and the Hurricanes blocked a field goal.

There also were things that will jump off the film and needs to be corrected such as Bethune-Cookman getting seven plays of at least 20 yards two of those being passes that wound up going for gains of 44 and 48. And a red-zone fumble also bothered Cristobal though he blamed himself for the particulars that went wrong on that play.

""Overall I thought we played relatively hard"" Cristobal said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNoZWNrZXJlZGZsYWcuY28udWsvMjAyMi8wOS9ob21ldG93bi1oZXJvLW1heC12ZXJzdGFwcGVuLXRha2VzLWRyYW1hdGljLXBvbGUtYXQtdGhlLWR1dGNoLWdyYW5kLXByaXgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hometown Hero Max Verstappen takes dramatic pole at the Dutch Grand Prix,"Red Bull Racing’s Max Verstappen took pole position at his home Grand Prix amid a sea of orange-sporting supporters narrowly beating out Charles Leclerc by just two hundredths of a second in Zandvoort.

Q1: Track Evolution and Shock Eliminations

A warm sunny day in Zandvoort sets the scene for Qualifying as the likes of Haas F1 Team Williams Racing and Alfa Romeo Racing take to the track to put in some early laps.

Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team made an early impression coming out on top of the timesheets before the frontrunning teams made their appearances with Lance Stroll in first and Sebastian Vettel in second. They were followed by Guanyu Zhou both Haas cars Valtteri Bottas Alexander Albon Pierre Gasly and Nicholas Latifi – rounding out the group of early runners. Yuki Tsunoda saw his first time get deleted.

Verstappen made his first attempt and quickly shot to the top of the board followed by the Ferraris of Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc. Sergio Perez and Daniel Ricciardo sit in fifth and sixth with ten minutes to go. Aston Martin and Haas both remain in the top ten as well as Zhou.

Lando Norris completed his first lap and rose to third place splitting the Ferraris. Norris was noted for an unsafe release in the session’s first minutes cutting off Tsunoda as he left the pits. Mercedes AMG-Petronas F1 Team took second and third with their first laps and the late-joining BWT Alpine F1 Team put in their first times soon after with Fernando Alonso making a quick run for fourth. Alonso’s team-mate Esteban Ocon cracked the top ten with his first attempt as well.

With four minutes to go nearly all the drivers are in their garages preparing for their final laps and the at-risk drivers are Vettel Ricciardo Albon Mick Schumacher and Latifi. Albon has the track essentially all to himself as he makes another attempt and lifts himself out of the elimination zone for seventh place. Both Haas drivers were taking their flying laps soon after with Kevin Magnussen reaching twelfth and Schumacher taking eighth.

With less than a minute to go both McLarens are in danger as well as Valtteri Bottas. Norris did however escape elimination by a huge margin setting a time for third after the checkered flag was flown. Tsunoda made a shock lap for second right after both of these impressive laps proving the importance of track evolution at this particular circuit. Being last out on track gives a considerable advantage with more running culminating into a grippier line.

Ultimately Bottas was eliminated from sixteenth place just one tenth behind team-mate Zhou who made it through to the next round. Magnussen finished a disappointing seventeenth unable to match Schumacher’s promising pace. Ricciardo was unable to scrape by in those final seconds ending up knocked out in eighteenth place. Vettel found himself on the back row after running into some problems on his last lap finishing in nineteenth alongside Latifi.

Eliminated: Bottas Magnussen Ricciardo Vettel Latifi

Q2: Stroll Schumacher advance as Alpines fall short

Albon was first and only car on the track when a red flag was flown for a flare that was tossed onto the track by a fan– this would happen again later in qualifying causing a hindrance for those on flying laps. The flag continued to get some pigeons off of the side of the track and then qualifying was underway once again.

The Red Bulls were out on track first alongside Albon as Verstappen went one followed by Perez in second fourth tenths behind. Hamilton split the Red Bulls with his first lap as Russell took fourth. Norris grabbed fifth place soon after while the rest of the grid put in their first attempts.

The Ferraris were only able to reach sixth and seventh with their initial runs unable to crack the times of Norris or Russell. Stroll put in a great time to go fourth his Aston Martin showing great potential in Zandvoort. Alonso joined the top ten with an eighth place run while Ocon remained down in the drop zone as the teams returned to the pits.

With just under six minutes to go Gasly Ocon Zhou Tsunoda and Schumacher were at risk of elimination. Albon was once again first out and remained in tenth after what would be his final attempt. Verstappen didn’t join the mass of cars going out for their final lap showing confidence in the solid time he had already set.

Sainz would take first and Russell second demoting Verstappen down to third. Albon was sent back to the drop zone knocked out by Zhou who took tenth with his final lap. Schumacher escaped elimination setting a time for eighth place with Ocon setting a time for tenth soon after to demote his team-mate into the elimination zone. Tsunoda made a late run for tenth as Gasly and Alonso were unable to improve. Alonso complained of traffic in his last lap with Perez going slowly around turn eight.

It was a surprising elimination for Alpine who were immensely competitive just last week in Spa. This left room for the likes of Schumacher and Stroll to make an unlikely appearance in Q3 as well as Tsunoda.

Eliminated: Gasly Ocon Alonso Zhou Albon

Q3: Verstappen Leclerc vie for pole as Perez crash ends session

Verstappen and Perez set the pace with the first times of the final qualifying session with Verstappen in first and Perez behind. There is already more potential to be found for Verstappen who took a little too much curb on the banked turn three. Norris slotted into third soon after.

Leclerc’s first attempt saw him take provisional pole with over six minutes to go as the top ten all made their initial laps. Hamilton split the Red Bulls to take third as Sainz later took fourth on his first go. Russell sat in sixth Norris seventh followed by Tsunoda and Schumacher. Stroll would not take to the track in what would have been his first Q3 appearance since Miami due to a technical issue.

Just one tenth apart after their first laps it appeared that the fight was on between Verstappen and Leclerc for the top spot. The margins were narrow across the board and it would be a tight battle to the checkered flag for all the drivers.

First to take his final lap Leclerc was purple in the first sector but couldn’t improve in the second. A third purple sector however allowed Leclerc to improve upon his leading time. Verstappen was on a flyer just behind green in the first sector and purple in the second– and finally crossed the line to take pole. Verstappen set a time of 1:10.342 only a touch ahead of Leclerc’s 1:10.363.

Sainz set a time for third as the fans applauded Verstappen’s pole effort but the attention was quickly drawn to Perez who had spun on the final turn and brought out a yellow flag. Both Mercedes drivers behind were unable to finish their laps among others. The top ten was set after the dramatic end to the session.

Verstappen took his second consecutive pole at his home event joined by Leclerc on the front row. Sainz and Hamilton follow in third and fourth. Perez solidified his position in fifth after his crash and will line up alongside Russell in Sixth. Norris and Schumacher make up the next row in seventh and eighth with Tsunoda and Stroll rounding out the top ten.

""Can you believe they pay us to do this?"" he said.

It seemed like money well spent after the Gators delivered their biggest season-opening victory in more than 50 years.

Anthony Richardson ran for three scores in his second career start including a 2-yard scamper with 1:25 remaining and Florida upset seventh-ranked Utah 29-26 on Saturday night to get the Napier era off to a rousing start.

Richardson was the best player on the field most of the night. He really showed up down the stretch although fifth-year linebacker Amari Burney was the one who sealed the victory for the rebuilding Gators. Burney intercepted Cam Rising's second-down pass into the end zone with 17 seconds remaining.

""Someone had to make a play"" Burney said. ""It happened to be me.""

That set off a wild celebration for many of the 90799 in attendance — the 10th most at home in school history. Richardson took a knee from there and the Gators rushed the field to revel in their 33rd consecutive victory in home season openers. That's the longest current streak in the nation.

Phelan M. Ebenhack/AP Florida linebacker Amari Burney (2) is swarmed by teammates on the sideline after making a game-saving interception in the end zone against Utah Saturday Sept. 3 2022 in Gainesville Fla.

“This group's got a lot of fight in them"" said Napier who replaced fired coach Dan Mullen in November. ""They've got a little bit different edge to them.""

Richardson ran 11 times for 106 yards and was never stopped for a loss. He completed 17 of 24 passes for 168 yards and played turnover-free football.

""He's going to get his (NFL payday)"" Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said. ""He's 6-4 230 and runs like a 4.3. He's a terrific player.""

Richardson had an electrifying 2-point conversion early in the fourth quarter that put the Gators up 22-19. He juked former Florida teammate Mohamoud Diabate with a pump fake and then sprinted right by fellow Utah linebacker Lander Barton before throwing a strike to Ja'Quavion Fraziers in the back of the end zone.

Utah answered and briefly took the lead but Richardson responded. He moved the chains with a third-down throw and again with a fourth-down run both of which set up his game winner.

""Just trying to make something happen. Glad it worked"" Richardson said.

Rising moved the Utes in position to steal one on the road for a team that entered the season with its highest preseason ranking in school history. But Rising's last pass was his most important — or costly — of the night.

""It wasn't Cam's best throw"" Whittingham said. ""I'm sure he'd like that back but he played great.""

Rising completed 22 of 32 passes for 216 yards with a touchdown and the turnover. He also ran for 91 more.

Tavion Thomas had 115 yards rushing and a score for Utah which caught a break when it rained about two hours before kickoff and erased whatever advantage Florida had with sweltering summer heat and humidity.",,,,,,
CL,Colgate-Palmolive,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvc2VwLzA0L3VuaXZlcnNpdHktb2YtYXJrYW5zYXMtYmVnaW5zLWZpbmFsLXBoYXNlLW9mL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,University of Arkansas begins final phase of Mullins Library renovation | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"



FAYETTEVILLE -- Between the last major renovation of the David W. Mullins Library in 1997 and the current two-phase remodeling project enrollment at the University of Arkansas Fayetteville has roughly doubled -- to approximately 30000 students -- so ""we're trying to serve double the students but in the same building"" said Kelsey Lovewell Lippard director of public relations for University Libraries.

The initial phase of renovations focused on the third and fourth levels of Mullins Library the main research library for the university and cost approximately $25 million. The second -- and final -- phase of a project that began in 2018 focuses on modernizing the first and second levels in a similar manner to the renovations of levels three and four which were completed in August 2021.

Senior Shannon Morneault believes the library's third and fourth levels were improved significantly by the first phase of the renovation and she thinks the first two levels will benefit similarly from phase two.

The renovated third and fourth levels are ""a lot better"" than their erstwhile editions which were ""not conducive to studying"" said the international business major. ""It was so open and bare that I wouldn't really use it; I'd go somewhere else -- like the law library -- because I could focus better.""

The renovated levels however ""are so much nicer that I spend a lot of time here because I can concentrate really well"" she said. ""The setting the colors the layout [are all better] and there are lots of options for seating"" -- alone with a partner with a big or small group on the quieter third floor or the louder fourth level -- ""so you can pick what fits you.""

""As a freshman and sophomore I didn't do as much work in between classes because I felt like I didn't really have anywhere to go but now I just come here"" she said. ""I get more done -- I was doing some work for my internship with Colgate-Palmolive [Company today] -- so it's less I have to do at night.""

As word has spread around campus about the improvements to the library's third and fourth levels -- and as the covid-19 pandemic has receded -- student visits have increased said Jason Battles dean of University Libraries. ""We're seeing really high usage this term almost double what we did in the spring semester.""

""I was in here every day last week"" during the first week of classes and ""this library will be a home base for me"" junior Jordyn Linnstaedter said Tuesday as she did work for her accounting class on the library's fourth floor. ""It's very important"" to have a space like this on campus.

Linnstaedter particularly appreciates the surplus of charging stations and ""comfortable seats"" on the library's third and fourth levels both of which will be part of the renovations on the first and second levels said the business major. ""It helps my brain switch into a productive setting.""

Study rooms on the remodeled levels have proved particularly popular with students Battles said. ""We could build 100 more and they'd all still be filled.""

The second/final phase of the library remodeling project has a budget of $35.5-$41.5 million and is scheduled for completion by June 2024 Lovewell said. Named for David Wiley Mullins then the university's president the library was built in 1968 to replace Vol Walker Hall as the university's main library and it's one of five librariries on campus but ""by far the largest.""

While the project's second/final phase won't start in earnest until the conclusion of this fall semester library patrons will notice collections and furnishings shift during this semester in preparation Lovewell said. For example books materials and furniture are currently being moved out of levels one and two which will remain open through December's final exams as ""we felt it was very important to be open through finals.""

While some have worried about books seemingly ""disappearing"" from the library Lovewell assures they are only moving due to the renovations and they will return.

""We love books -- the library will always have books -- and we continue to purchase books"" she said. ""We're just protecting them during the renovations.""

Library users can find collections that have been moved via an online renovation updates page https://libraries.uark.edu/updates/.

The first and second levels will be closed temporarily during the second semester due to asbestos abatement and other construction but the third and fourth levels will remain open during the library's remodeling with access to stairs and elevators near the west and east entrances according to Lovewell. Core library services including the help desk interlibrary loan course reserves and multimedia services will relocate operations to the fourth level during construction and the Special Collections reading room will reopen Sept. 6 in Mullins Library room 329.

This renovation will result in more prominent placement for Special Collections currently ""tucked away in a basement corner room"" Battles said. ""We really want to make that stand out by bringing it to the center of the first floor with -- hopefully -- a staircase leading to it [rather than] buried.""

Special Collections is ""special"" for several reasons including that ""anyone can come here and use it or access it remotely"" said Joshua Youngblood rare books librarian and head of Special Collections instruction and outreach. ""We have scholars come here from all over the world and it's a great service.""

""We have the largest collection of printed materials on Arkansas by Arkansans anywhere in the world and we could do different exhibitions every day for a year without ever touching the end of what we have here"" Youngblood added. ""We also help students learn critical thinking and analysis of primary sources.""

Special Collections will have a dedicated classroom space as part of the final phase of library renovations Battles said. ""That'll be great a dedicated instuctional component.""

There will also be a space dedicated to processing materials the library receives Lovewell said. ""We get thousands of pieces each year and we need to carefully process all of that for archiving.""

Climate control is another critical piece of the final phase of the library's renovation Battles said. ""For preservation purposes humidity is the big [concern because] we want to store these materials so they last.""

Kennedy & Violich Architecture (KVA) from Boston is partnering with Fayetteville's DEMX Architecture on the project with Con-Real the general contractor according to Lovewell. KVA has previously worked on construction and renovation projects at Harvard University's Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America and the Hayden Library at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology while Con-Real served as general contractor on the first phase of the Mullins Library project as well as construction of the University Libraries high-density storage facility known as LINX and located in the Art and Design District off of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.

A cafe on the first floor of Mullins Library is also part of the renovation's final phase Lovewell said. ""Kim and Chris Fowler donated $500000 for the cafe and anonymous donors provided $600000 for the renovation of our Special Collections division and Arkansas Folk and Traditional Arts department.""

""Students are really excited about that cafe -- they've already been asking about getting jobs there -- and it'll be nice for them to have more than a vending machine in the library"" Lovewell said. ""Students can spend hours upon hours here especially during finals.""

Renovations will also create more flexible spaces that can be used for meetings of small or large groups Battles said. Those groups can be members of the campus community but also the community beyond campus in Fayetteville Washington County and Northwest Arkansas.

The renovated second level will also feature virtual reality and augmented reality spaces -- ""those are used in a variety of disciplines -- maker technology and we'd like to have a recording studio"" Battles said. ""The library is here for every student in every program.""

The Royals would go on to win 3-2.

The ever-exciting Kansas City Royals' rookie third baseman Bobby Witt Jr. added to his highlight reel Sunday in the Royals' 3-2 win over the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park Sunday.

Witt made an incredible Harlem Globetrotters-like barehanded play to get the Royals out of the fifth inning with the Tigers threatening.

With Tigers' left-handed outfielder Victor Reyes up in a tie-game with two outs in the bottom of the fifth the Royals played a heavy shift to the right-side of the infield with Witt sliding into the spot that is normally occupied by Royals' shortstop Nicky Lopez.

Reyes hit a sharp grounder straight back at the pitcher Collin Snider. The ball bounced off Snider's foot and straight up into the air.

Witt sprinted in to snag the ball out of thin-air with his bare right hand then fired over to first getting a much-needed out thwarting the Tigers' hopes of taking the lead.

Witt would later knock in a run on an RBI double giving the Royals a 3-2 lead in the top of the eighth. The lead would hold and the Royals would collect their second-straight victory securing a road-series win in Detroit.

With the series win the Royals improve to 55-80 and remain in fourth place of the American League Central.

The Royals open a three-game series against the Cleveland Guardians at home Monday then they'll host the Tigers for a grudge match in Kansas City.

The Tigers now fall to 51-83 in last place of the AL Central. They'll travel to Los Angeles for a three-game series against the Angels this week before visiting Kansas City for a rematch with the Royals.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmthbnNhc2NpdHkuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9tbGIva2Fuc2FzLWNpdHktcm95YWxzL2FydGljbGUyNjUzMjcwODEuaHRtbNIBTmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmthbnNhc2NpdHkuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9tbGIva2Fuc2FzLWNpdHktcm95YWxzL2FydGljbGUyNjUzMjcwODEuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bobby Witt Jr.’s RBI double lifts KC Royals to series-clinching win at Detroit Tigers,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.kansascity.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Game notes: Max Castillo’s list of home teams in 2022 reads something like a Johnny Cash song: He’s been everywhere — New Hampshire Buffalo Toronto Omaha and now Kansas City.

The 23-year-old Venezuelan rookie — not to be confused with Max Casella a 55-year-old former ""Newsie"" who also played Doogie Howser's best friend in the 1990s — will be making his 11th career big-league appearance and fourth start when he toes the rubber for the Royals at Comerica Park; he started the year in Double-A in the Blue Jays’ organization moved up to Triple-A in May and on to the majors in June. After posting a 3.05 ERA over 20 2/3 innings for the Blue Jays in June and July the big righty was sent to K.C. in the Jays’ deal for Whit Merrifield. Castillo made one start for the Royals — five innings of one-run ball against the Tampa Bay Rays on Aug. 18 before being sent back down to Triple-A.

Despite all those uniform changes Castillo has seen a bit of the Tigers’ lineup this season. On July 29 he pitched a scoreless ninth in the Tigers’ 4-2 victory in Toronto inducing grounders by Victor Reyes Javier Báez and Jeimer Candelario and walking Harold Castro with two outs. Three weeks later on Aug. 18 Castillo started for Omaha against Toledo — he gave up two runs (one earned) in three innings — and faced Ryan Kreidler and Spencer Torkelson twice each. Kreidler struck out swinging in the first inning then doubled in the third while Torkelson singled in the second and reached in the third on a fielder’s choice. Castillo also faced the newest Tiger 28-year-old Josh Lester (called up after Miguel Cabrera went on the 10-day IL Saturday night) retiring him on a strikeout and a groundout.

Manning meanwhile will be facing the Royals for the second time this season and the Tigers are hoping he lasts longer than his first go-round: On April 16 Marrning gave up a run on five hits over two innings before departing with shoulder discomfort that would turn into more than three months on the injured list. (Those five hits: A single by Bobby Witt Jr. a single by the now-traded Andrew Benintendi a single by Hunter Dozier a single by Adalberto Mondesi and yep a single by Nicky Lopez.) Manning has been much more effective since his IL stint thanks to an improved slider grip (though he didn’t have much of a feel for it in his previous start allowing seven runs to the Seattle Mariners on Tuesday).

After Sunday’s matchup the Tigers will head out to Anaheim California for a three-game set beginning Monday night against the Los Angeles Angels. The Royals also play Monday night though their trip is slightly shorter as they head home to host the Cleveland Guardians for three games in K.C. After those series the Tigers and Royals will reunite for a three-game series in Kansas City. (They also have three more games in Detroit at the end of September.)

The defense — left-fielder Victor Reyes shortstop Javier Báez and catcher Tucker Barnhart — executed a relay to perfection to get a K.C. runner at the plate but on the next play a hard-hit ball got past third baseman Jeimer Candelario and the Royals scored the game-winning run.

""I think it's a tough play"" manager A.J. Hinch said. ""I think it's a makable play. But those are hard plays. This is a tough league and guys hit it hard. You got one chance to field it and get it to first but he just couldn't come up with it.""

The Tigers lost 3-2 in the series finale at Comerica Park.

IN THE BULLPEN:Reliever Alex Lange 'ready to go' for Tigers ... and Team Puerto Rico

WELCOME TO THE SHOW:Josh Lester promoted from Triple-A Toledo

The Tigers (51-83) dropped two of three games to the Royals. Left-handed closer Gregory Soto entered for the eighth inning — his first eighth-inning appearance since Aug. 1 — and walked Nicky Lopez on seven pitches with one out.

""When you go to the bullpen as early as we had to the way it all mapped out we're just trying to get to the finish line with the lead or tied"" Hinch said. ""Obviously they came up big at the last opportunity.""

MJ Melendez doubled to the left-field corner and Lopez tried to score from first base. The relay throw which ended in Barnhart smothering a one-hopper from Báez beat Lopez to the plate for the second out.

Melendez advanced to third on the play at the plate.

Royals rookie Bobby Witt Jr. then hammered a third-pitch slider with a 101.7 mph exit velocity. The ball snuck underneath a diving Candelario and rolled into left field. Melendez scored easily putting Kansas City ahead 3-2 while Witt stretched a single into a double.

""We've got to make sure that play is made"" Báez said.

Tigers rookie center fielder Riley Greene finished 1-for-4 with two strikeouts and extended his hitting streak to 13 games with a single in the third inning. He also completed a leaping catch in the right-center gap in the ninth inning.

Greene is hitting .396 (21-for-53) with two doubles three triples two home runs five walks and 16 strikeouts over his past 13 games.

Second baseman Ryan Kreidler a fellow rookie playing the third MLB game of his career went 0-for-4 with two strikeouts.

""I had to get adjusted when he played third (base) because he's so long"" Báez said of Kreidler's defense. ""He can get to balls that we can get at the same time. But he's a great athlete too. Like I've said all year they just got to get experience playing time and make adjustments when they make mistakes.""

A rough fourth for Manning

Right-hander Matt Manning took the mound for his seventh start since returning from the injured list in early August. The 24-year-old allowed two runs on five hits and three walks with three strikeouts over four innings.

The fourth inning an 33-pitch effort doomed Manning.

""It was just finding my pitches"" Manning said. ""I would have it here and there then lose it for a little bit. For the most part I think my fastball missed over the plate when it should have been away. I ran into some trouble in the fourth inning.""

During that inning he gave up two singles two walks and one hit-by-pitch. Michael A. Taylor singled to open the fourth then Michael Massey was hit by a slider. A one-out walk to Drew Waters loaded the bases.

Lopez singled on a first-pitch curveball from Manning putting the Royals ahead 1-0. The next batter Melendez drew a nine-pitch walk — the plate appearance included five fouls — with the bases loaded to increase the margin to 2-0.

The Tigers despite Manning's struggles stuck with their young pitcher against two of the best hitters in Kansas City's lineup. Witt Jr. flied out to right field on a first-pitch slider; Salvador Perez struck out swinging on a down-and-away 94.2 mph four-seam fastball.

""He's got to pitch through this"" Hinch said. ""When you're making decisions when you're trying to develop young pitchers and getting them through the stress that comes with being erratic or spraying the ball it's tough living sometimes. He's got to learn how to do it.""

For Manning's 90 pitches (57 strikes) he threw 43 four-seam fastballs (48%) 20 sliders (22%) 12 changeups (13%) 11 curveballs (12%) and four sinkers (4%). He recorded eight swings and misses — four with his fastball — and seven called strikes.

His fastball averaged 92.9 mph.

Max pain

Opposing Manning Royals right-hander Max Castillo allowed two runs on five hits and one walk with five strikeouts over 4⅔ innings. After Kansas City scored two runs in the top of the fourth inning the Tigers countered with two runs in the bottom of the frame.

Báez lined a changeup in a 2-0 count into left for a leadoff single. Harold Castro like Báez worked a 2-0 count. Instead of a changeup though Castro received a fastball in the strike zone.

""I'm seeing the ball better and slowing everything down"" Báez said. ""I'm working in the (batting) cage to focus on seeing the ball and keeping my plan.""

Castro hammered the ball 390 feet and into the right-center seats for a two-run home run his sixth homer of the year to make it 2-2.

Goodbye Pineda

After Sunday's game Hinch announced that veteran right-hander Michael Pineda has been designated for assignment with the team intending to call up a reliever in his place and give his spot in the rotation to a younger pitcher.

Pineda returned from the 15-day injured list on Saturday and allowed five runs on six hits with two walks over four innings. Signed to a one-year $5.5 million contract during the spring Pineda's time with the Tigers featured a 2-7 record and a 5.79 ERA over 46⅔ innings with 26 strikeouts and eight walks."

There's good reason investors fear the economy could slide further into a recession and drag stocks down with it. Persistent inflation rising interest rates and a stumbling housing market are all worrisome indicators that we might have further to fall before we reach bottom.

That's why finding a safe haven now might make sense and utility stocks may be your best bet. They can be the ballast for a portfolio during troubled times and perform well when the storm clouds finally break. There's good reason utilities have long been seen as the ultimate widows-and-orphans stocks.

Pulling your money out of the market is not really a viable option if you want to build generational wealth because if you miss the rebound your long-term returns will be severely harmed. Over the 20-year period between 2001 and 2021 the S&P 500 returned 9.5% annually on average but if you had missed out on just the market's 10 best days your returns would have been cut to 5.3%.

That's why buying now makes sense. The following three utility stocks are ones you'll be happy you own a decade into the future.

American States Water

American States Water (AWR 0.27%) is a utility that's seen it all. Founded in 1929 it's been through the Great Depression two world wars numerous market crashes and recessions and a host of global geopolitical events that have turned the world upside down.

And through it all it has steadfastly paid a dividend to its investors -- 86 straight years in all -- but more importantly has raised the payout each and every year for 68 consecutive years (it just raised it again by 8.9%). While that puts American States Water in that rarified group of stocks called Dividend Kings it's all the more notable because no other stock on the market has as long a track record of raising its dividend than this water utility.

American States Water is primarily tasked with providing clean water and electricity to Southern California which represents about 66% of its revenue but it also has long-term contracts with the U.S. government to provide water to 11 military bases which account for another quarter of total revenue. The rest it gets from generating electricity.

Shares of the utility are down 20% year-to-date as it has missed analyst earnings estimates several times over the past few quarters but that is largely due to California utility regulators failing to approve its rate requests for 2022. That means American States Water is still operating under 2021 rates so if and when the increases do go through they should be retroactive to January.

The water utility is a solid dependable business that has a long history of returning value to shareholders a track record that will undoubtedly continue to 2032 and beyond.

Consolidated Edison

On the other side of the country is Consolidated Edison (ED -0.18%) commonly known as ConEd which provides electricity natural gas and steam to customers in New York state. It has also heavily invested in the renewable energy market and maintains it supports ""a reliable transition from fossil fuels to renewables to reduce carbon emissions"" while also maximizing returns for investors. It operates a network of utility-scale wind and solar energy projects across 20 states that can generate three gigawatts of power.

Yet even though ConEd's stock is up 15% in 2022 management believes that the market is undervaluing its business because of the differences inherent in the fossil fuel and clean energy businesses. It is conducting a strategic review of its clean energy assets though it hasn't said whether a full sale spinoff or asset sale is the desired outcome. Analysts believe the utility will sell the unit as a whole to reduce its equity needs.

ConEd is another dependable dividend-paying stock to own for the long haul that has hiked its payout for 46 consecutive years making it a Dividend Aristocrat but one within reach of soon becoming a Dividend King.

Brookfield Infrastructure Partners

Yes Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP -1.87%) owns traditional utility operations around the globe with electricity transmission and distribution lines in Australia and Brazil and natural gas pipelines in North America South America and India. Yet it also owns and operates a number of ""utility-like"" infrastructure assets too including railroads toll roads ports and liquefied natural gas (LNG) export operations; oil and natural gas midstream assets; and data centers cell towers fiber-optic cables and data transmission assets.

Now Brookfield is getting into computer chips too as it just signed an agreement with semiconductor giant Intel (INTC 1.77%) to jointly fund the chipmaker's new fabrication facility it's building in Arizona. Let's just say Brookfield Infrastructure is a unique play on the utility space.

What's especially distinctive about this infrastructure stock is that it's not especially beholden to any one asset and is willing to sell any one of them off and either reinvest in existing operations or buy a new one. It has called that its ""buy enhance sell repeat"" strategy. Wash. Rinse. Repeat.

While Brookfield doesn't have the same track record as American States or ConEd in dividend payments it has raised its payout every year for 10 years. In another 10 years' time investors will appreciate both its capital investments and its dividend.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4dHJhLmVjL25vdGljaWEvanVkaWNpYWwvcmlvcy1jdW1wbGVhbm9zLWxlLWRpZXJvbi01LXRpcm9zLTcyNDM5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Los Ríos: En su cumpleaños le dieron 5 tiros,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL2Z1dGJvbC5yYWRpb2Zvcm11bGEuY29tLm14L2N1cmlvc2lkYWRlcy8yMDIyLzkvMy9jdWFsLWVyYS1sYS1leHRyYW5hLXBydWViYS1xdWUtdGhvbWFzLWVkaXNvbi1oYWNpYS1xdWllbi1sZS1wZWRpYS10cmFiYWpvLTYyNTA5Lmh0bWzSAZwBaHR0cHM6Ly9mdXRib2wucmFkaW9mb3JtdWxhLmNvbS5teC9jdXJpb3NpZGFkZXMvMjAyMi85LzMvY3VhbC1lcmEtbGEtZXh0cmFuYS1wcnVlYmEtcXVlLXRob21hcy1lZGlzb24taGFjaWEtcXVpZW4tbGUtcGVkaWEtdHJhYmFqby02MjUwOS5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,¿Cuál era la extraña prueba que Thomas Edison hacía a quien le pedía trabajo?,"Si alguna vez has pedido trabajo es muy probable que sepas que algunos reclutadores sorprenden con preguntas muy random o raras que parecen no estar relacionadas con la vacante. Sin embargo eso te parecerá poca cosa cuando te digamos qué extraña prueba hacía Thomas Edison a quienes le solicitaban empleo.

Resulta que al igual que los encargados de Recursos Humanos Edison sabía que la mayoría de los candidatos a un puesto tenían el mismo nivel de conocimiento por lo que hacía un test sencillo para ver más allá de lo aprendido en las escuela.

Con el fin de buscar cómo pensaban y analizaban cada situación y así darse una idea de la creatividad e inteligencia de sus futuros empleados Thomas Edison los invitaba a tomar un plato de sopa con él.

¿Qué es la prueba de la sopa de Edison?

El fin de esta reunión era ver si los solicitantes añadían sal y pimienta antes de probar lo que estaba en su plato o si esperaban hasta haberlo probado para luego sazonar.

Quienes sin probarla sazonaban su sopa eran descartados de inmediato por el inventor pues no quería a su lado gente que se basara en presunciones sino personas que tuvieran ganas de probar cosas nuevas y buscar soluciones para ellas.

Es así que quienes al estar frente al plato preguntaban si tenían algún condimento extra para darle un mejor sabor eran mucho mejor recibidos por el inventor pues ahí notaba que la creatividad e innovación corría por su sangre.

Aunado a esa prueba Thomas Edison también preguntaba cosas inesperadas a los candidatos.

Ello con el objetivo de saber el nivel de cultura general que tenían quienes formarían parte de su equipo de trabajo.

Así que ya sabes la próxima vez que tengas una entrevista de empleo pon mucha atención para evitar solo hablar de tus estudios.

Da tiempo para ejemplificar cómo es que gracias a tu inteligencia has podido resolver alguna situación práctica relacionada con la vacante y ten la mente abierta para responder cualquier cosa.

Recuerda que no hay respuestas erróneas; sin embargo siempre debes cuidar tus gestos y forma de actuar frente al empleador que podría ser tan peculiar como Thomas Edison.",,,,,,

The iron-flow battery storage system built by ESS Tech is located in the white shipping container in the foreground. Read more

In a repurposed mushroom barn in Chester County Sycamore International Inc. recycles electronic equipment including refurbishing 30000 old laptops a month for resale. Steven Figgatt Sycamore’s chief executive says his West Grove company is all about the circular economy.

In keeping with its sustainable mission Sycamore earlier this year installed a rooftop solar system to convert its operations to renewable energy. But Figgatt 36 only declared his company’s freedom from the electric grid in late August when he commissioned a new innovative battery storage system that assures his business is supplied by solar power even when the sun isn’t shining.

“We’re calling it our Energy Independence Day” he said.

Figgatt went out on a limb with his choice of energy-storage technology selecting a novel system called an iron-flow battery the first of its kind on the East Coast.

Iron-flow batteries are among many promising grid-scale energy storage technologies that are vying for acceptance in a market where renewable energy is expanding quickly to replace greenhouse-gas emitting power sources.

As renewable generation grows in importance the market for energy-storage systems is expected to play a key role. Wind and solar systems produce power intermittently depending upon the weather and grid operators say they will need more storage systems as renewable energy takes a bigger share of the power-generation market.

Makers of battery storage devices anticipate a boost from the Inflation Reduction Act which President Joe Biden signed into law Aug. 16. The law contains tax incentives for buyers of energy storage devices.

Longer life span. No explosions.

An iron-flow battery is significantly different from a lithium-ion battery the device commonly used in electric vehicles mobile devices and some commercial applications.

The iron-flow battery’s big selling point is that its electrolyte the material that conducts an electrical charge is not a metal mined in an unfriendly country. Instead the electrolyte is made of ferrous chloride which is basically iron salt and water all widely available. Unlike lithium it’s nontoxic and doesn’t overheat and explode.

Sycamore’s long-duration battery can discharge its power over 12 hours about three times longer than a lithium battery or roughly corresponding to the time when the sun isn’t shining. It can hold about 400 kilowatt hours of power enough to supply about 28 homes for 12 hours.

The iron-flow battery is also warrantied to withstand 25 years of charging and discharging cycles without deteriorating. It promises to be operating long after the Energizer Bunny wheezes to the sidelines.

“It was exciting trying something new” Figgatt said. “I mean I love that there’s no toxic chemicals there’s no risk of fire hazards that you have with lithium-ion batteries. And also you can cycle it all the time unlike lithium-ion batteries that have a finite number of cycles before they need to be replaced. This is kind of limitless so we’re going to run off it all the time.”

The downside of flow batteries is that they are big heavy and stationary — Sycamore’s battery is housed in a 40-foot shipping container that weighed nearly 20 tons before 19000 liters of electrolyte are added. They’re not designed for automobiles or mobile devices but for large-scale support of the power grid.

A second battery on order

Most of the nations’ long-duration energy storage is located in pumped-storage hydropower plants such as Constellation Energy’s Muddy Run facility in Lancaster County where water is pumped into a reservoir at a higher elevation and then released to generate power when needed.

Flow batteries store energy in tanks of electrolytes which pass through an electrochemical membrane to extract electrons during the charging and discharging process.

The iron-flow device Sycamore acquired is called an Energy Warehouse manufactured by ESS Tech Inc. of Wilsonville Ore. The company has been developing a commercial iron-flow battery for more than a decade and last year went public in a merger with a special purpose acquisition company becoming the first publicly listed manufacturer of long-duration batteries. Like many tech start-ups its stock has fared poorly this year and is down 60% since its launch last October.

But its fortunes may improve. It has a backlog of orders including one for another unit for Sycamore International whose business is picking up more institutional clients who want to dispose of old electronic devices and permanently erase any traces of data in Sycamore’s secure process. Sycamore plans to break ground this fall to expand into a new building in West Grove also equipped with its own solar system.

ESS has installed several batteries for San Diego Gas & Electric in Cameron Corners Calif. a town at risk of getting cut off from the grid from wild fires. It’s also working with Portland General Electric a utility company to build a half-acre Energy Center with about eight times the storage capacity as West Grove unit. Last month it announced an agreement to ship 70 Battery Warehouses to Australia and to open an assembly plant in that country by 2024.

But the biggest news in the last month was the Inflation Reduction Act which contains tax incentives for buyers of energy storage devices that are boosted by 10% for domestically produced devices such as the ESS Energy Warehouse. The IRA also provides credits to buyers of standalone battery storage units while previous tax incentives applied only to energy storage directly associated with renewable generation.

“It helps level the playing field for us versus our competitors” Eric Dresselhuys the chief executive of ESS said in an interview. ESS’s competitors are usually Chinese lithium battery makers who Dresselhuys says receive state support. While the IRA tax credits are available for all batteries he said “it’s worth more if you buy U.S. made products.”

‘The battery is basically an insurance product’

The seeds for Sycamore International’s move into solar were planted more than five years ago at Millersville University when Figgatt attended the launch of a solar system at the university’s new Lombardo Welcome Center. There Figgatt met Dave Santoleri president of TerraSol Energies Inc. a Chadds Ford firm that designed and installed the 175-kilowatt Millersville system. Figgatt enlisted Terrasol to explore doing a solar installation at its West Grove plant.

“I knew flow batteries were a cool idea” Santoleri said. “I did a search and found five companies that made them. Three of them were out of business.” He did find that ESS was still in business and the only manufacturer located in the U.S. He and Figgatt visited the company in Oregon and were sold.

“We did our due diligence” Figgatt said. “We do know it’s a newer technology so we went through a whole vetting process with ESS.”

The battery system basically doubled the cost of Sycamore’s solar installation — the battery itself is in the neighborhood of $200000 though Figgatt is vague about his total investment in the system. Figgatt figures the whole system will pay for itself in six to nine years depending upon what happens with market energy prices. Meanwhile Sycamore’s energy costs are fixed.

For Figgatt the battery backup provides more than just savings off his Peco bill. When the second battery system is installed Sycamore International will be able to sell some of its surplus power back to the regional grid operator to help keep power levels in the area consistent an important background role known as frequency regulation.

It will spare his business from long storm-related outages. And the voltage produced from his solar system is also finely tuned which is critically important to Sycamore’s operations where his 70 employees may be erasing the delicate hard drives of as many as 600 laptops simultaneously as they undergo refurbishment.

“When the power goes out during some of these big weather events it’s devastating” he said. “The grid is not as reliable out here. So the battery is basically an insurance product. From my perspective it pays for itself in like three days of power outages.”

The importance of energy storage to a decarbonized energy future is so significant that U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer M. Granholm visited ESS’s plant in Oregon last month part of a tour touting the climate benefits of the IRA.

In West Grove Sycamore International’s ribbon-cutting of its battery storage system on Aug. 25 also drew praise from U.S. Rep. Chrissy Houlahan a Democrat who represents Chester and Berks Counties. “This project represents the kind of forward-thinking solution we need to build a decarbonized resilient energy system” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9odWJibGUtc3BhY2UtdGVsZXNjb3BlLXBob3RvLWdhbGF4eS1zdHJhbmdlLXNoYXBl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hubble Space Telescope captures stunning photo of a galaxy with a strange shape,"The Hubble Space Telescope captured a new photo of a dwarf irregular galaxy called NGC 1156 located 25 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Aries.

Bright red ""blossoms"" of star formation stand out in a new image of an unconventional galaxy.

A new photo from the Hubble Space Telescope captures a dwarf irregular galaxy called NGC 1156. Located 25 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Aries NGC 1156 boasts a unique structure unlike most other galaxies — a ""marvel of galactic morphology"" according to a statement from the European Space Agency (ESA) which is a partner on the mission.

""Its thousands of bright stars evoke a spiral galaxy but it lacks the characteristic 'winding' structure"" ESA officials wrote in the statement releasing the new Hubble image on Aug. 22. ""Yet it also radiates a diffuse glow much like an elliptical galaxy and its core of older redder stars .""

Related: The best Hubble Space Telescope images of all time!

The shining red blossoms scattered across the photo represent areas of intense star formation which fuels the galaxy's extreme energy. The ionized hydrogen gas outflows from these young stars gives off a red glow.

Spiral galaxies typically exhibit a central bulge made up of older dimmer stars surrounded by a flat rotating disk of hot young stars. While NGC 1156 does have a densely-packed center with older generations of stars its younger stars are not contained in the telltale spiral arms circling the galaxy. Given it lacks any sort of distinct shape — neither a spiral nor an elliptical structure — astronomers have classified NGC 1156 as a dwarf irregular galaxy.

However the galaxy is also classified as isolated because no other galaxies are located close enough to influence its odd shape and continuing star formation according to the statement.

While Hubble has previously photographed NGC 1156 the new image was captured as part of a program called Every Known Nearby Galaxy which aims to fill a gap in galactic observations.

""Astronomers noticed that only three quarters of the galaxies within just over 30 million light-years of Earth had been observed by Hubble in sufficient detail to study the makeup of the stars within them"" according to the ESA statement. ""They proposed that in between larger projects Hubble could take snapshots of the remaining quarter — including NGC 1156. Gap-filling programs like this one ensure that the best use is made of Hubble's valuable observing time.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbHRpbW9yZXN1bi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wNC9kbGEtcGlwZXItbW92ZS1jb250aW51ZXMtbmVnbGVjdC1vZi1jZW50cmFsLWJ1c2luZXNzLWRpc3RyaWN0LXJlYWRlci1jb21tZW50YXJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DLA Piper move continues neglect of central business district | READER COMMENTARY,"The Baltimore Sun reported the news that the DLA Piper law firm is moving to Harbor East after a 20-year escape to the suburbs. However what The Sun did not say is that the firm is jumping over the central business district like so many other recent companies have done including: Constellation Energy Legg Mason (now Franklin Templeton) T. Rowe Price Transamerica Ernst & Young Gordon Feinblatt and Saul Ewing. To say that DLA Piper is moving back “downtown” ignores the reality that the large business community has abandoned our city in fact and in spirit (“DLA Piper will relocate Baltimore office back downtown after two decades” Aug. 29).

Most of downtown’s “biggies” completely shut down their offices for two years to allow their employees to work from home while the small businesses that were dependent on them for survival were forced to close or sharply reduce their business. It has been a case of the haves and the have-nots. The biggies did not care. There was a time now long past when Baltimore corporate leaders were our city’s boosters. Through everything that Baltimore has endured — the relentless violence the obsession with (but lack of action regarding) the squeegee kids (entirely at the expense of small downtown businesses) the loss of jobs the decimation of the central business district the closing of small businesses the continuous population decline uncompetitive real estate tax rates (while favored big developers and large companies are beneficiaries of huge special tax breaks at the expense of residents and small businesses) there has been utter and complete silence from our business and civic leaders.

You cannot name the leader of any large company or nonprofit organization who has spoken publicly to raise the concerns that are on everybody’s mind. They are either afraid to do so or they do not care. They simply stand by while our city is dying. Doing nothing and saying nothing. It is tragic. It is morally reprehensible.

— David F. Tufaro Baltimore

Ciganda made birdies on holes 2 3 10 11 13 and 18 to sign 65 strokes one less than her immediate pursuers including South Korean Hyo Joo Kim American Lexi Thompson and Australian Lydia Ko (66 ).

Although Ciganda hasn't won on the American tour since 2016 when she posted her two LPGA wins Ciganda has six titles on the European tour most recently last July in Spain. She attributes her recent successes to a change in caddy.

Carlota Ciganda statements

""I have a new caddy. We started together at the end of last year and it's been a good thing. It's taking us a while to get to know each other but he's really good on the greens and gives me a lot of confidence in my putt"" said the Spanish golfer.

of press. ""I really like this place and I started out really solid. I hit a lot of greens well hit big shots to give me opportunities taking greens. I think it's key on this course"" Ciganda added. The Jamie Farr Owens Corning Classic is a women's LPGA Tour golf tournament.

This event was created in 1984 and is held in Sylvania a town not far from Toledo in Ohio (United States) in September. This tournament was created by former PGA caddy Judd Sullivan who wanted to bring a women's event to his hometown of Toledo.

He contacted actor Jamie Farr also a native of the city to help him find sponsors. The tournament that bears the actor's name organizes a series of charitable events that have generated more than $4.8 million in profits since 1984 for children in southern Ohio and northern Michigan.

From 1984 to 1988 the tournament was held at Glengarry Country Club. Since 1989 the course of the Highland Meadows Golf Club has hosted the tournament. The tournament is preceded by two other events: the juniors and the celebrities (pro-am tournament).

Over the course of the different editions the tournament has changed names several times. 1984–1996: Jamie Farr Toledo Classic

Shivanna can be seen interacting with the debutant Kireeti Reddy and the latter's father G. Janardhan Reddy. The entire unit including Kireeti was not only pleasantly surprised by the visit but also endeared by the presence of the superstar on the sets.

The upcoming Telugu-Kannada film has been produced by Sai Korrapati's Vaarahi Chalana Chitram which has previously produced several high-profile Telugu films such as Eega and Legend. Sree Leela will star opposite Kireeti Reddy in the upcoming film with the very popular Devi Sri Prasad scoring the music.

There are many reasons to indulge in a Costco membership apart from the one-of-a-kind return policy and cheap food court favorites. With inflation peaking in June of this year saving money is a top priority for many Americans and what better way to save than by grabbing a giant to-go pizza for under $10 and stocking up on an affordable rotisserie chicken for later in the week.

Spending $4.99 on a 3-pound bird seems like a great deal but there's more to the price than meets the wallet so to speak. In 2019 Costco made the move to bring chicken production in-house by opening up its own processing plant in Nebraska which was estimated to save the company ""10 to 35 cents per bird"" (via Grocery Dive).

However those extra cents saved come with the potential price of customers seeing the light regarding their favorite Costco chickens. Not only have Costco employees exposed the difficult working conditions on Reddit in Costco's ""chicken room"" but more social media users have been talking about the animal cruelty behind the beloved $4.99 favorite since Costco was sued this summer for inhumane animal practices (via CNN).

You may think the talk must end somewhere but unfortunately Reddit users are also discussing if these affordable birds are actually cooked when purchased."

Roman Reigns took down Drew McIntyre at Clash at the Castle in Cardiff Wales on Saturday to retain the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship in a controversial finish.

The Scot looked to have the match won after hitting a Claymore kick but the referee was pulled out of the ring by The Usos' younger brother Solo Sikoa after a two-count to preserve his cousin's title reign.

McIntyre attempted to pull Sikoa into the ring but he was necked on the rope and Reigns hit the challenger with a Spear to get the pin.

All of that came after Theory attempted to cash in his Money in the Bank contract when the original referee was knocked out. As he was handing over the briefcase heavyweight boxing champion Tyson Fury got up from his front-row seat and knocked him out with a punch.

Fury got into the ring after Reigns retained the title. The two had a brief staredown before shaking hands when the undisputed WWE champion left the ring. The Gypsy King stuck around to congratulate McIntyre on his performance before serenading the crowd with a rendition of Don McLean's ""American Pie.""

The Tribal Chief kept his historic title run in check extending his reign as universal champion to well beyond 700 days.

Reigns unified the Universal and WWE Championships at WrestleMania 38 in April when he defeated Brock Lesnar in the main event. When no one was able to take either title from him he and The Beast Incarnate had one final match at SummerSlam in July.

Thanks in large part to help from The Usos The Head of the Table defeated Lesnar in a Last Man Standing match to retain both titles.

One day earlier McIntyre beat Sheamus in a Donnybrook match to ensure he would face the winner of Reigns vs. Lesnar in Cardiff.

With The Scottish Warrior established as the No. 1 contender he confronted The Bloodline on SmackDown but got more than he bargained for.

Karrion Kross and Scarlett made a surprise return to WWE after getting released last year and The Herald of Doomsday immediately set his sights on McIntyre Reigns and the Universal Championship.

Kross and Scarlett were at ringside in the crowd for the bout. There was a brief moment when the former NXT champ and McIntyre stared each other down during the match after Kross tossed a water bottle at the No. 1 contender.

McIntyre faced a ton of adversity leading up to Clash at the Castle due to the presence of Kross and The Usos and there was some thought that all of them would get involved in the title match in Wales.

However it was another member of Reigns' family who would provide the crucial interference.

While every world title match is significant Saturday was especially huge for McIntyre since he is a native of Scotland and headlined the first WWE main roster pay-per-view in the United Kingdom in nearly 20 years.

Also the first two times the 37-year-old won the WWE Championship occurred in front of no fans due to the COVID-19 pandemic so he had the opportunity to stand tall in front of over 60000 members of the WWE Universe.

Saturday marked arguably the biggest moment of McIntyre's career but it ended in bitter disappointment with Reigns retaining once again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpdmVtZXNwb3J0LmNvbS84ODA1NTg5Ny13d2UtY2xhc2gtYXQtdGhlLWNhc3RsZS1iYXlsZXktYnJlYWtzLWNoYXJhY3Rlci1kdWUtdG8tY3Jvd2RzLWNoYW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WWE Clash at the Castle: Bayley breaks character due to crowd's chant,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpdmVtZXNwb3J0LmNvbS84ODA1NTg5Ny13d2UtY2xhc2gtYXQtdGhlLWNhc3RsZS1iYXlsZXktYnJlYWtzLWNoYXJhY3Rlci1kdWUtdG8tY3Jvd2RzLWNoYW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzEwMDQ0ODE4LWxpdi1tb3JnYW4tZGVmZWF0cy1zaGF5bmEtYmFzemxlci1yZXRhaW5zLXdvbWVucy10aXRsZS1hdC13d2UtY2xhc2gtYXQtdGhlLWNhc3RsZdIBjgFodHRwczovL3N5bmRpY2F0aW9uLmJsZWFjaGVycmVwb3J0LmNvbS9hbXAvMTAwNDQ4MTgtbGl2LW1vcmdhbi1kZWZlYXRzLXNoYXluYS1iYXN6bGVyLXJldGFpbnMtd29tZW5zLXRpdGxlLWF0LXd3ZS1jbGFzaC1hdC10aGUtY2FzdGxlLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Liv Morgan Defeats Shayna Baszler Retains Women's Title at WWE Clash at the Castle,"Photo credit: WWE.com

Liv Morgan defeated Shayna Baszler at WWE Clash at the Castle in Cardiff Wales on Saturday to retain the SmackDown Women's Championship.

After a punishing encounter against The Queen of Spades the titleholder delivered a Codebreaker before sealing the win with her Oblivion finisher.

The bout represented Morgan's second title defense at a pay-per-view following her win against Ronda Rousey at SummerSlam on July 30.

Morgan originally earned the SmackDown Women's Championship in early July at Money in the Bank when she won the women's Money in the Bank ladder match and then successfully cashed in on the former UFC star who was nursing an injured leg following her match against Natalya.

Rousey was initially gracious in defeat offering Morgan a hug but things changed at SummerSlam.

Morgan tapped while Rousey had her in an armbar but the referee didn't see it and counted Rousey's shoulders to the mat instead. An incensed Rousey attacked both Morgan and the official after the match which led to her getting fined and suspended indefinitely. She wasn't reinstated until Friday night on SmackDown.

While Rousey was out WWE had to find a new No. 1 contender and one was determined via a gauntlet match held on an episode of SmackDown last month.

Baszler won the seven-woman bout by last pinning Raquel Rodriguez. The match also featured Sonya Deville Shotzi Aliyah Xia Li and Natalya.

That marked one of her biggest wins of the past few years and put her back in the thick of the championship hunt which hadn't really been the case since she lost a Raw Women's Championship match against Becky Lynch at WrestleMania 36.

It wasn't particularly surprising that The Queen of Spades won since she was always a favorite of Triple H's in NXT and figured to experience a renaissance after he took over as head of WWE Creative.

Also Baszler has long been close friends with Rousey meaning that having her face Morgan for the SmackDown women's title opened the door for WWE to potentially move forward with a storyline involving both ex-MMA stars.

Morgan once again managed to keep her title reign intact at Clash at the Castle but with an angry Rousey lurking that may not be the case for long.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZWNoby5jby51ay9uZXdzLzIwODgxNjU5LmVpZ2h0LWNyaW1pbmFscy1qYWlsZWQtc291dGhhbXB0b24tYXVndXN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nine criminals sentenced in Southampton in August,"Drug dealers dangerous drivers and stalkers are just some of the offenders who have been put behind bars by city judges.

More freight trains are rolling through Maine as cargo ship traffic ramps up in New Brunswick

By Bill Trotter Bangor Daily News Staff At the Port of Saint John in New Brunswick 70 miles east of the Maine border there’s been a flurry of change recently and it’s been aggressively expanded to handle more vessels looking to deliver shipments to the East Coast. Meanwhile the port is also pursuing upgrades to the province’s rail network to better distribute the cargo to points west and south.

By Bill Trotter Bangor Daily News Staff

At the Port of Saint John in New Brunswick 70 miles east of the Maine border there’s been a flurry of change recently and it’s been aggressively expanded to handle more vessels looking to deliver shipments to the East Coast. Meanwhile the port is also pursuing upgrades to the province’s rail network to better distribute the cargo to points west and south.

As major cargo ports in North America struggle with a backlog of ships waiting to unload more freight trains are passing through Maine brightening the economic prospects of far-flung Maine towns along the rail route. But it’s not without challenge — for some Maine towns the trains are also bringing complications.

In Vanceboro U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has decided to cut back on the hours that vehicles can drive across the St. Croix River which separates the two countries so it can shift personnel to handle the increase in rail traffic. In Jackman about 150 miles west along the tracks cars and trucks face long waits as the trains stop traffic on Route 201 and the blast of the trains’ horns — a safety requirement when it crosses the road — sometimes wakes people in the middle of the night.

But for Ken Stannix the mayor of McAdam the increase in rail traffic through his town into the U.S. represents a much-needed economic boost for rural towns in northern Maine and southwest New Brunswick.

Stannix said hundreds of millions of Canadian dollars have been spent on recent improvements to the port in Saint John and tens of millions more in Canadian currency is being spent to improve the rail line from Saint John through McAdam which is just five miles east of Vanceboro. He said two trains each of them nearly two miles long leave McAdam and cross the border at Vanceboro every day but that number is expected to increase to 12 in the next three years — a jump of 500 percent.

“They don’t spend that money to have a couple of freight trains roll through Vanceboro” Stannix said of the New Brunswick rail improvements. “The growth prospects are huge. New Brunswick and Maine stand to gain from this growth.”

Improving east-west transportation corridors through Maine has long been a goal of economic development officials who see Maine’s long looping border with Canada as an asset. Maine borders the Canadian provinces of Quebec to the northwest and New Brunswick to the east giving the state the shortest route between the maritime provinces and the rest of Canada. Roughly 20 million people live in the heavily populated corridor just across Maine’s western border between Quebec City and Windsor Ontario.

The Canadian corridor also serves as a gateway for railroads transporting goods to Midwest cities such as Detroit and Chicago.

The United States is also investing in rail in Maine. Nate Moulton Maine Department of Transportation’s director of freight and passenger rail services said $35 million in public and private funding has been used in the past two years to improve freight capabilities on Maine rail lines south of Bangor in large part to handle the increased cargo shipments coming from Saint John.

“There’s no question there is increased freight rail traffic in Maine and it will continue” Moulton said. “We’ve got some really good rail operators now. They need material they need fuel they need crews. It helps give us a robust rail infrastructure in Maine.”

In addition to bringing new jobs to part of the state that has lost many in recent decades through the decline of paper mills and other manufacturing businesses the expansion of freight rail service in Maine has the potential to attract other businesses that want to take advantage of the growing transportation route Moulton said.

“It’s good jobs for Maine” he said of the impact of increasing rail traffic. “There are a lot of good things happening.”

The most recently arrived rail operators in Maine are Canadian Pacific and CSX which have acquired local rail lines in Maine to tap into the large volumes of freight coming across the border.

After pulling out of Maine in 1995 Canadian Pacific returned two years ago when it acquired Central Maine and Quebec Railway extending its reach from the West Coast and Midwest to Brownville Hermon and Searsport. Through an agreement with Canadian firm NBM Railways — which owns tracks that extend east from Brownville through Mattawamkeag and Vanceboro to Saint John — Canadian Pacific has direct access to the New Brunswick cargo port.

Earlier this summer Florida-based CSX acquired Pan Am Railways extending its reach from Illinois and Florida through New England to Bangor and Mattawamkeag. Prior to the purchase Pan Am had applied for a federal grant to help cover half of the estimated $42 million cost of rebuilding its line between Waterville and Mattawamkeag a distance of about 110 miles which will allow the line to carry heavier and longer trains from Saint John according to online trade publication Atlantic Northeast Rails & Ports.

In addition CSX and the Federal Railroad Administration are splitting the bill on $35 million worth of improvements on its line between Yarmouth and Waterville. The company has not yet started upgrading the line from Waterville through Bangor to Mattawamkeag but a CSX spokeswoman said that work is expected to begin next year.

Since 2020 Canadian Pacific has spent $90 million upgrading rail lines in Maine and Quebec and its service through Maine to Saint John has significantly increased said Andy Cummings a company spokesman. Because of the heavier freight traffic across Maine the company worked with U.S. border officials to open a new container inspection station in Jackman earlier this year.

Cummings said the railroad also transports Maine forest products to customers out of state and has been looking for other ways to grow its rail service in Maine. It also has jobs to fill in Brownville.

“Overall business [in Maine and Quebec] has grown more substantially than we anticipated when we acquired the line” Cummings said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3BkZS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9sYXctZW5mb3JjZW1lbnQtc2VhcmNoLWZvci1lc2NhcGVkLXByaXNvbmVyLWluLWZsb3JlbmNlLWNvdW50eS1vZmZpY2lhbHMtc2F50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Law enforcement capture escaped Florence County prisoner in wooded area: Police,"Law enforcement captured an escaped prisoner Friday night without incident according to police.

The picture shows the devastation caused after a young driver fell asleep at the wheel and ploughed into the side of a house in North Yorkshire.

Jacob Cummins 20 was jailed for eight months at York Crown Court last month for causing serious injury by dangerous driving.

The crash left his friend 20-year-old Connor Campbell-Miles fighting for his life in hospital.

He suffered life-changing injuries and had to have part of his bowel removed in surgery.

The court heard that Cummins of Main Street Sledmere had been awake for 20 hours since getting up for work at 6am the previous morning until the crash in the early hours of 16 September last year.

He finished work at 8pm on 15 September and then picked up Connor and another friend to go for a night out in York.

They spent the night in the city centre with some women friends who said Cummins “drank some alcohol during the night – two bottles of VK (alcopop) and one or two pints of beer” said prosecutor Andrew Finlay.

They stayed in York till about 2am. One of the women said she offered to take the three men home in her car and even bring Cummins back to York the following morning to collect his vehicle but he insisted on driving.

‘Think about the consequences’

Jacob Cummins

Defence solicitor David Camidge said although a breath test showed that Cummins had alcohol in his system he was under the drink-drive limit and the main reason for the crash was his lack of sleep which left him very tired.

The crash left a 6ft-by-6ft hole in the wall at the side of the house in Thornton Lane High Marishes.

[adrotate group=”3″]

A house beam went straight through the windscreen and impaled the front passenger seat which was mercifully empty after the car smashed through a fence and straight into the side of the house.

Fortunately the residents inside were unhurt.

Connor from Sherburn near Malton had been asleep in the back seat when the crash happened. He told the court his parents had “come to my (hospital) bedside to say goodbye” because his prospects were so bleak.

He said he had been left in unbearable agony faced more surgery and was practically “unemployable” because employers were reluctant to take him on due to his physical condition.

Today North Yorkshire Police issued a photo of the crash scene and said: “Last week a North Yorkshire man received an eight month prison sentence after he fell asleep while driving home from a night out after being awake for 21 hours.

“He crashed his car broke a fence and caused extensive damage to a residential property.

“But far worse than that he had a passenger in the car – a friend who was getting a lift home.

“The passenger was asleep at the time of the crash and suffered serious injuries.

“We know that it’s not always possible to avoid driving when you’re tired but please think about the consequences.

“At the first signs of tiredness stop and take a break.

“Pull over safely and give yourself chance to rest. It could well be the power nap which saves your life.”

CASHEL KING CORMACS 2-15 CARRICK SWAN 2-9

Cashel King Cormacs made it three wins from three to top Group 4 in the FBD Insurance County Premier IHC with a deserved six points victory over Carrick Swan at Fethard on Saturday afternoon 2-15 to 2-9.

A constant heavy drizzle during the first half and a greasy sliotar that must have resembled a bar of soap at times ensured difficult conditions for both sides but it was Cashel who finished stronger to maintain their impressive one hundred per cent record.

It was a third successive defeat for Carrick Swan and yet they challenged in all three group games. They led by two points at the interval 1-6 to 1-4 and after an even third quarter were just a single point in arrears 1-11 to 2-7 entering the final ten minutes.

However a straight red card for the influential Gavin O’Halloran disrupted their rhythm and the King Cormacs outscored them 1-3 to 0-2 in the closing stages the goal from Adrian Cummins proving the decisive score.

It wasn’t a trouble-free win for Cashel. Injuries deprived them of four key players including county man Ger Browne and joint captain Eoghan Connolly and at times they struggled to kill off the Swan challenge. It was at times an absorbing battle between the two town sides if very often error-strewn but Cashel goals from Ross Bonnar and Adrian Cummins proved crucial with Paddy Fahy chipping in with three fine points from play.

The conditions weren’t conducive to pretty hurling with passes going astray with the slippery ball and both sides struggling with their shooting. Conn Bonnar and Paddy Fahy put Cashel two up in four minutes but the lead was wiped out within ten minutes through a Danny O’Hanlon 65 and a superb sideline cut from Gavin O’Halloran.

Cashel edged two clear again from a Devon Ryan free and Fahy from play and could have been farther ahead but for a brilliant save by Swan keeper Adam Kerwick from a Devon Ryan shot. Then at the other end Swan took the first goal chance that came their way Cory Ryan finding the net with a brilliant goal to put the Carrick men 1-2 to 0-4 ahead.



Swan now upped the pace and a Danny O’Hanlon free put them two ahead following a foul on Jamie Holloway who was causing a lot of problems for the Cashel defence. Conn Bonnar from halfway and Danny O’Hanlon traded frees before a Devon Ryan free after he had been fouled himself saw Swan lead by a single point 1-4 to 0-6 at the break.

It was a lead that lasted no more than twenty seconds into the second half Cashel breaking clear from the throw-in with Devon Ryan setting up Ross Bonnar for a cracking goal past Kerwick. Cashel thought they had extended the lead through Jack O’Connor with the umpire waving the white flag but after consulting with his linesman referee Sean Lonergan overturned the decision.

Swan benefited from the reprieve and after play swung to the other end Cory Ryan was sharpest in a goalmouth scramble to poke the ball to the net for his second goal and restore the Swan lead 2-4 to 1-6.

Despite the concession of the goal Cashel looked the more likely winners but their long-range shooting let them down with some very poor wides. It took a Devon Ryan free – one of six he scored from placed balls – to draw them level again and a great point from Paddy Fahy edged them in front. Holloway and Gavin O’Halloran from a free had Swan replies but Cashel were looking that little bit more dangerous with points from Ronan Connolly Jack O’Connor and a Devon Ryan free putting them two clear 1-11 to 2-6 midway through the half.

Swan substitute Kevin Lanigan and Devon Ryan with a free for Cashel swapped points before one of the game’s key moments. A superb Cashel move cut open the Swan defence with sub Aaron Browne in his first involvement since his introduction putting Devon Ryan through the centre and his rasping shot was brilliantly saved by Kerwick for the expense of a 65.

However the referee had seen a foul by Gavin O’Halloran in the build-up and after allowing the advantage showed the Carrick man a straight red card. Devon Ryan pointed the ’65 to make it 1-13 to 2-7 and three minutes later the win was secured when a pass across goal from Paddy Fahy found Adrian Cummins unmarked and he gave Kerwick no chance with the shot.

There was no way back for Swan from a six points deficit and two points each from either side Devon Ryan and Adrian Cummins for Cashel and Dean Waters and a Cory Ryan free for Swan completing the scoring.

Cashel King Cormacs now go through to the championship quarter-finals as one of the four top seeds with Carrick Swan looking at a preliminary quarter final against a second seeded team as well as facing a relegation play-off.

By 2030 Ireland’s Climate Action Plan has committed to generating 80% of electricity through renewable sources.

Currently it produces about 80% through fossil fuels. Eirgrid’s most recent figures for this week show coal generating 15.5%; gas generating 73.8% and renewables generating just 4.6%.

Amber alerts on Ireland’s electricity grid this summer jolted many to the cold realities of potential energy blackouts this winter.

The war in Ukraine has cast a glaring light on Ireland’s — and Europe’s energy insecurity.

Data centres — a growing part of Ireland’s economy — have also been under the spotlight for draining the national grid of energy at a time of scarcity.

But offshore floating wind power means energy scarcity does not need to feature in Ireland’s energy lexicon in the future Dr Val Cummins director of Simply Blue Group and former marine scientist and academic said.

Sometimes dubbed the “Saudi Arabia of wind energy” Ireland could both secure its own energy supply and become a major exporter of wind-derived energy and technology while boosting and protecting marine environments for the benefit of both biodiversity and the fishing industry Dr Cummins said. Floating wind power is a win-win for everyone she said.

The opportunities are great but so is the responsibility to implement speedier while still robust processes for bringing renewable energy sources on stream.

“Now is our moment” Dr Cummins said.

“We were inward-looking as an island. We had our back to the sea — until now. Now that’s changing.

The biggest opportunity we have to increase our renewable energy output of all the technologies — whether it’s offshore wind solar biomass or onshore wind — is floating offshore wind. That’s an enormous opportunity for this country.

“We have such an incredible maritime area as a small island nation. Our marine area is seven times our landmass.

“Floating wind technology can be deployed off the south coast and off the west coast where the continental shelf lends itself really really well to an opportunity to get up to and beyond 30GW of floating offshore wind [30 gigawatts would power about 30m homes she said] which is in the Programme for Government.

“It's key to get us to net zero [carbon emissions] by 2050 but it’s also an opportunity not just to be self-sufficient in terms of our own energy demand but also to supply energy to Europe and elsewhere.”

An academic in University College Cork for 20 years Dr Cummins moved to industry two years ago and is now director at Simply Blue Group a marine resource company which aims to operate some of Ireland’s first floating offshore wind farms.

The biggest opportunity we have to increase our renewable energy output of all the technologies — whether it’s offshore wind solar biomass or onshore wind — is floating offshore wind. That’s an enormous opportunity for this country.

Floating wind as a technology can unlock Ireland’s potential as a renewable energy producer she believes.

Unlike the more common fixed-bottom offshore wind farms floating wind turbines are anchored to the seabed rather than being pile-driven into it lessening its environmental impact.

They can operate in deeper water so can be deployed off Ireland’s wind-rich west and south coasts which will be a game-changer for Ireland’s wind-power generation Dr Cummins said.

And because they can operate in deeper water further from the coast they are invisible or barely visible out on the horizon line so should spark fewer complaints from people worried about visual impact.

Two offshore floating wind projects which would be Ireland’s first are planned by Simply Blue Group one for Cork and one for Clare.

The Cork offshore wind farm called the Emerald Project would produce 1.3GW of energy and cost some €2bn with an additional €100m in planning costs.

Currently some 28GW of floating wind opportunities are being explored by developers in Ireland.

Outdated laws and regulations coupled with chronic understaffing in regulatory bodies have been holding up projects.

But a new body the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority (Mara) is due to be set up from January giving the industry hope that projects will be faster to progress from next year.

One of this new State agency’s major functions will be to regulate and issue a new type of licence called a Maritime Area Consent (Mac) which are effectively seabed leases. This lease will allow a specified area of the seabed to be used for a specified purpose — like wind turbines — with terms and conditions and a payment levy attached.

It replaces foreshore licences previously issued under the old Foreshore Act. A Mac is needed before a wind energy company can begin proper feasibility studies on a site and before it can apply for planning permission from An Bord Pleanála.

Mara will also issue foreshore licences from the Minister for Housing Local Government and Heritage.

Mara was established under legislation enacted in December 2021. The Maritime Area Planning Act 2021 was heralded by Government as “the biggest reform of marine governance since the foundation of the state”.

The act provides the legal and administrative underpinning for a new planning regime in the maritime area facilitating the development of offshore energy.

Adequately resourcing Mara is crucial so Macs can be issued efficiently from early 2023 Dr Cummins said.

Better resourcing An Bord Pleanála is also key so that vital infrastructure projects like wind farms can begin to be built.

Data centres — a growing part of Ireland’s economy — have also been under the spotlight for draining the national grid of energy at a time of scarcity.

An offshore floating wind farm takes about 10 years and billions of euro to bring on stream so avoiding unnecessary delays is crucial if Ireland is to hit its offshore wind targets — by 2030 Ireland's Climate Action Plan commits to developing 5GW of offshore wind energy.

Getting Ireland to its net-zero carbon goal by 2050 will require wind power plants generating 25GW of electricity.

The current Programme for Government has set targets of 30GW of floating offshore wind from 2030.

The European Commission aims to increase Europe’s offshore wind capacity from its current level of 12gw to 300gw by 2050.

1GW can power about 1m homes. Moneypoint power station produces less than 1GW for comparison.

And change is possible. Data from the US Energy Administration identifies seven countries at or very nearly 100% renewable power — Iceland (100 percent) Paraguay (100) Costa Rica (99) Norway (98.5) Austria (80) Brazil (75) and Denmark (69.4).

Ireland by contrast is still overwhelmingly reliant on fossil duels.

“It’s going in the right direction but it’s the speed of it in the context of the urgency in which we need to see the change delivered” Dr Cummins said.

“Over the last two years in particular Government has really been proactive in putting a robust national marine planning framework in place. We didn’t have that surprisingly until now even though we are an island nation we were relying on very outdated legislation for planning for the foreshore.

“Whereas now we have a whole new raft of legislation that’s a very important part of the jigsaw. But we need to keep that acceleration keep that pressure on in terms of the next pieces of the jigsaw that need to be put together.

""Government needs a roadmap for how to use this resource. Knowing we have an ambition for 30GW and more what’s the roadmap for industry and civil society and Government working together to drive that forward?”

Offshore wind has raised concerns amongst some fishers concerned wind farms may spring up in their most fertile fishing grounds and therefore limit their access to fish stock.

Conservationists have been concerned about offshore wind’s impact on migrating birds and marine life.

Calls have been made for Government to speed up allocation of protected marine conservation areas where marine life can thrive without human interference before the seabed is carved up by wind energy companies.

But Dr Cummins said offshore wind companies can and must work in tandem with all stakeholders to create positive outcomes for the marine environment and for the people who depend on it for a living.

“We have an opportunity to work together. That’s hugely important — coexistence with the fishers but also coexistence with other key stakeholders key interests including and importantly NGOs who are really and rightly concerned with the designation of areas offshore as marine protected areas of conservation.

There’s a wonderful opportunity for floating windfarms offshore to become de facto marine conservation areas. If they’re ‘no-take’ zones for fishing then they’re biological hotspots.

“Offshore floating wind can be part of an integrated solution to enhancing marine conservation and helping to create healthier oceans as well as renewable energy contributing to decarbonisation and reaching climate targets” Dr Cummins said.

Fishers noticed the sea teaming with life around the gas field off Kinsale when the project was decommissioned she said.

Offshore wind has raised concerns amongst some fishers concerned wind farms may spring up in their most fertile fishing grounds and therefore limit their access to fish stock.

And floating offshore wind can work in synergy with other marine stakeholders — allowing marine life a safe space to grow ultimately boosting catch for fishers who face increasingly empty nets she said.

Floating offshore wind has already been deployed around Europe and the onus is now on Ireland to catch up Dr Cummins said.

Floating offshore wind farms are already used off the northeast coast of the England off the coast of Aberdeen in Scotland off Portugal and Norway.

“The latest project to come on stream is off Norway where there’s a floating wind farm being developed by Equinor to power an offshore oil or gas production platform” Dr Cummins said.

“And the next project to come after that will be ours Simply Blue Group which will be in the Celtic Sea off the coast of Pembroke. It’s a project we’ve been developing with Total Energies. It will produce 96MW floating wind that should be operational by 2026.

“Wind Europe estimates that there will be 7GW of floating wind in deployment in Europe alone by 2030. So it’s a sector that’s really accelerating. Lots of European countries have really embraced it and declared ambitious targets for deployment.”

Along with England Scotland Portugal and Norway Spain France Sweden and Italy are also working to develop floating offshore wind.

“That’s great. But they don’t have the extent of the resource we have. We have the Wild Atlantic Way — it’s not called that for nothing. In technical jargon it has a good capacity factor” Dr Cummins said.

So we have the marine space we have fantastic wind. We need to really ramp up and build on work done by Government in the last couple of years and show commitment in terms of the road map for floating wind.”

The Programme for Government originally committed to 5GW of installed offshore wind capacity by 2030 which was recently augmented by another 2GW bringing the target to 7GW by 2030. It also aimed to produce a long-term plan to take advantage of a potential of at least 30GW of floating wind thereafter.

IGW can power roughly 1m homes Dr Cummins said.

For comparison Moneypoint power station generates 915 MW so less than 1GW.

“I was 21 years with UCC before moving to Simply Blue Group two years ago. My whole career was in marine science and marine resource management. When I crossed over to industry I was really motivated by the opportunity to have an impact in relation to being really smart about utilisation of our ocean resource.

I always felt we could be doing so much more as a maritime nation but really in terms of the climate change piece really seeing the opportunities of floating offshore wind to be a massive contributor to getting to net zero.

“But also since I joined Simply Blue it’s been about what needs to happen now to help with energy security issues which have become really really intensified over the last six months.

""And back to that piece around marine conservation and thinking about protecting the oceans but having these turbines out there like sentinels of the sea. It’s a whole new way of looking at things it’s exciting it’s the future.

“This Programme for Government put down an ambition for producing at least 30GW — that’s 30m homes.

“But just a few weeks ago Minister Ryan announced the first big step which is to do 2GW floating wind — you have to walk before you can run — which would be used for the production of green hydrogen.”

Sometimes dubbed the “Saudi Arabia of wind energy” Ireland could both secure its own energy supply and become a major exporter of wind-derived energy and technology while boosting and protecting marine environments for the benefit of both biodiversity and the fishing industry Dr Cummins said.

When you talk about floating offshore wind you very quickly get to the subject of green hydrogen she said.

""Because with the opportunity to do 30GW offshore you have to ask where that electricity is going to go?

“And certainly there’s a great opportunity to feed it into the grid here displacing sources like Moneypoint but also that electricity can be sent directly to your interconnector in terms of exporting electrons.

""Or we could export gas — so using electricity from the offshore floating wind farms to power a process onshore of electrolysis which basically splits water into hydrogen and oxygen and when you do that you get green hydrogen.

“Green hydrogen becomes a fundamental component of e-fuel production.

“And where you have your hydrogen if you take nitrogen out of the atmosphere which is regularly available and you put them together you can produce green ammonia.

“Green ammonia is used in fertiliser and Ireland has huge demand for that in terms of farming. And the global demand for green ammonia is absolutely huge.

""But it can also be used as a fuel — and e-fuel — for shipping. Ships can be adapted to run on green ammonia and again these are the enormous opportunities that Ireland has.

“When I go back to my roadmap for offshore floating wind we have made a baby step in relation to the announcement of 2Ggw to produce green hydrogen but that’s a fundamental first step — because it will show that we can do it it will be proof of concept. Then we can build on that. And that then becomes a game changer not just for decarbonisation and energy security and the marine environment but also for regional development. Because a lot of this will happen for example off the west coast.""

Floating offshore wind therefore creates huge opportunities for the regeneration of rural coastal Ireland.

We have an opportunity for a whole new economic sector in rural coastal Ireland which will breathe life back into communities which are really feeling the pain of the demise of for example the fishing sector.

""So it is such an exciting story because it hits economy it hits environment it hits society it’s just there for the taking.

""I think there’s a fantastic sense of the opportunity across the board. I think Government sees it and realises it.

""The challenge is that we don’t have enough capacity in key Government departments and agencies to move on this fast enough. And that's what we need to see — we need to see more bandwidth in the likes of Mara the National Parks and Wildlife Service in An Bord Pleanála and all of these key instruments of the State that need to work together to put the framework in place for us to do this at scale.

""Because the opportunity is one of incredible scale. 30GW is there as a number. We will need most of that to decarbonise ourselves to get to 2050. Some analysis will say there’s 50GW off the south coast and 80GW off the west coast. It is huge in terms of opportunity and the opportunity Ireland has is unique. We can develop this at a scale that other countries will never be able to do.

""But we need to be early movers. We need to ensure we’re getting access to the supply chain and developing the supply chain for ourselves. And the more that we stay at the current pace the increased risk is that other countries will storm ahead and we’ll be left behind.

""So we need to action this now. Now is our moment."""

The ACLU of Rhode Island is raising concerns over the data CVS is collecting as part of its COVID booster shot program.

In a letter sent to CVS President Karen Lynch ACLU of Rhode Island Director Steven Brown questioned the retail pharmacy’s requirement that demographic data — including gender and ethnicity — be provided in order for a person to be eligible for a booster shot.

“While we can appreciate the utility of seeking and obtaining this demographic data I trust you would agree that it is not in the best interest of public health if even a few people are discouraged from obtaining Covid vaccination because of a request for what is ultimately extraneous information” wrote Brown.

SEE FULL LETTER BELOW

When asked for comment CVS provided the following response.

“We’re committed to providing equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines regardless of an individual’s sex gender race ethnicity or other characteristics not relevant to current vaccine eligibility requirements” said Amy Thibault CVS’ Director for External Communications.

“As a participant in the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for vaccinations we’re required to report certain clinical information to the CDC” Thibault added.

CVS however did not respond to the following questions:

Do you require all of the information -- sex gender race ethnicity -- for someone to get a booster shot?

Is it required by the federal government to collect all of this information -- specifically sex gender race and ethnicity?

Pursuant to these two questions -- if a person does not provide sex gender race or ethnicity information -- are they then not allowed to get a shot?

Thibault provided information on the newly authorized bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccines.

This week scheduling vaccine boosters at CVS was halted temporarily to accommodate the latest development.

“We plan to offer the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccines once authorized by the CDC and once we have received supply. Following FDA authorization on August 31 the government’s distribution of the bivalent boosters started immediately. We expect our pharmacies to begin to receive supply on a rolling basis over the next few days and appointments will be made available at CVS.com and via the CVS Pharmacy app” said Thibault. “We continue to provide our communities with convenient access to vaccines at CVS Pharmacy including the approved COVID-19 primary series as well as flu and a number of other vaccinations such as pneumonia and shingles.”



“As announced by the FDA [Wednesday’ the emergency use authorization (EUA) of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines has been updated to remove the use of the original monovalent Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines for booster administration” said Thibault. “For that reason patients will need to reschedule appointments for COVID-19 boosters to allow for the administration of the bivalent vaccine once approved by the CDC and received by our pharmacies. CVS.com and the CVS Pharmacy app will be updated as doses are received.”

The federal government stopped delivering free at-home Covid tests to Americans on Friday suspending a program that has provided more than 600 million tests to U.S. households since it launched at the beginning of this year. The White House blames lawmakers for the program's suspension noting on the program's website that ""Congress hasn't provided additional funding to replenish the nation's stockpile of tests."" If and when Congress passes additional funding the government will ""expeditiously resume"" the distribution of free at-home tests a White House official told NBC News.

Most at-home Covid tests don't detect the virus as well as laboratory-based tests like PCRs according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. But they can still detect Covid at least 80% of the time meaning that positive test results are ""typically accurate.""

They can be taken anywhere and are much faster than other tests providing results in minutes. PCR tests take hours or even up to a few days to do the same.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends taking at-home tests:

Immediately if you have any Covid symptoms

Immediately if you're about to attend a gathering or event with a lot of people

At least five days after exposure if you were exposed to someone with Covid

If you do test positive the at-home tests could later be a useful tool for determining whether you've finished the course of your infection.

The CDC says a negative test result ""doesn't rule out an infection"" and ""may not be reliable"" especially if you have symptoms. Consider taking an at-home test again 24 to 48 hours after your first test to ""increase confidence"" that you aren't infected the agency notes.

Essentially if you test negative with an at-home test you should take another test one or two days later before considering yourself fully in the clear.

CDC head Dr. Walensky on fast-tracking new omicron-specific boosters: The consequences could be worse 'if we wait'

Omicron-specific Covid booster shots are just weeks away. Here's who will—and won't—be eligible",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzA0L25ldy1kZXRhaWxzLWVtZXJnZS1pbi12aW9sZW50LWVsaXphLWZsZXRjaGVyLWtpZG5hcHBpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New details emerge in 'violent' Eliza Fletcher kidnapping,"Missing Memphis teacher Eliza Fletcher was forced into a black SUV in a “violent” manner — and a pair of sandals left at the scene helped cops locate her alleged abductor according to police documents obtained by The Post Sunday.

Fletcher 34 was abducted on her regular 4 a.m. jog Friday after stalked by Cleotha Abston who’d waited for her to run past him the police affidavit alleged. She had run from her home in the fancy Central Gardens neighborhood to a nice area near the University of Memphis campus.

Court records show Abston 38 is a previously convicted kidnapper: He pleaded guilty to especially aggravated kidnapping and robbery in 2001. He was sentenced to 24 years and 11 years in prison respectively although it is unclear how long he remained incarcerated and if he served his sentences concurrently.

Tennessee authorities obtained surveillance footage of the kidnapping which allegedly showed Abston running “aggressively toward the victim and then force the victim Eliza Fletcher into the passenger’s side of the vehicle” the documents said.

“During the abduction there appeared to be a struggle” according to the affidavit which cited “noticeable damage to the back-passenger taillight area” of the GMC Terrain.

Police said after Fletcher — who is still missing — was forced into the black SUV “the vehicle then sat in the parking lot with the victim inside for approximately four minutes before it drove off.”

It is unclear what happened during that time.

Cleotha Abston was charged with especially aggravated kidnapping and tampering with evidence. Tennessee Department of Corrections

“As the abduction was violent with as captured on video the suspect waiting for then rushing towards the victim then forcing the victim into the car where she was confined and removed and continues to be missing it is believed and supported by the facts and physical evidence that she suffered serious injury” the affidavit said.

“Further it is probable and apparent from witness statements that these injuries left evidence of blood in the car the defendant cleaned” it continued.

According to the document at 6:45 a.m. good Samaritan Miles Fortas was riding his bike when he found Fletcher’s cellphone and a pair of Champion slide sandals in the area where the mom of two was kidnapped. Fortas unaware of what had occurred gave the items to the Fletcher family who then turned them over to authorities.

“DNA found on the shoes matched DNA for Cleotha Abston” that was already in a police database according to the affidavit.

Authorities said they found footage of Abston wearing Champion slides the day before the alleged kidnapping. They also said his cellphone pinged near the site of the Friday kidnapping.

The car apparently belongs to a local cleaning service that employed Abston.

Officers arrested him after finding him standing in the doorway of his home.

“He attempted to flee but was taken into custody” the police document said.

A witness said she saw Abston “cleaning the interior of the GMC Terrain with floor cleaner” just before 8 a.m. Friday and reported to police that “he was behaving oddly.” He was also spotted washing his clothes in a sink.

Police have yet to find Fletcher and are continuing to ask for the public’s help in locating her. Abston would not tell authorities where she is.

Abston previously pleaded guilty to kidnapping local attorney Kemper Durand around 2 a.m. May 25 2000 walking up behind him with a gun and forcing him to get into the trunk of a car local paper the Memphis Flyer reported at the time. Abston was a minor when he kidnapped Durand and brought him to an ATM to withdraw money.

It’s no secret that northern St. Johns County is experiencing a massive development boom right now.

Over the past decade thousands of single-family and multi-family living units have popped up throughout land that had long sat undeveloped near the county line between southern Duval and northern St. Johns. And with any significant growth in population commercial development soon follows.

Over half a dozen retail center projects have sprung up in the northern St. Johns area. The largest of these projects Durbin Park has been detailed frequently by local publications including our own. We even created a running list of future Durbin Park tenants which became one of our most-viewed articles of all time showing the clear interest in retail growth in the area.

That’s why we’ve decided to make a dedicated list for all of the other less-mentioned developments that are underway in the northern St. Johns area. We’ve listed what we know so far below and we’ll keep updating the list as new tenants and projects are announced.

Be sure to check back frequently for updates. And if you wish to utilize these lists on your own page please be sure to link back to our original list!

Scheduling validations: Workforce.com’s scheduling is set up to ensure you set create the perfect shifts every time by flagging potential issues before you publish. Managers are notified if a shift is at risk for potential labor law violations or if an employee on PTO is accidentally assigned a shift. It can also account for certifications to prevent unqualified employees from working specific shifts.

Complete visibility with time and attendance: Time and attendance is synced with scheduling; this means that data flows seamlessly between those two modules providing insight into wage and hour variances. In any case of no-shows you can quickly fill in the gaps and offer vacant shifts to other qualified and available staff.

Mobile self-service: Workforce.com’s employee app offloads simple admin work to employees freeing up managerial time and engaging staff in a healthy way. Things like timesheet reviews shift swaps onboarding and task checklists can all be completed over the app. Moreover staff can update personal details and bank information without needing to go through a bloated HR workflow.

Skills management: With the skills management feature you can build a skills library and assess employee competency via a skills matrix. Over time you can track employee development in these skills and create action plans to train and cross-train staff in certain areas.

Real-time insights: Leading Indicators™ map labor costs to sales in real-time enabling frontline managers to stay on top of SPLH and receive alerts on potential overtime.

Fast & accurate payroll processing: Managers can auto-approve timesheets based on conditions like time punch variances and overtime alerts. All issues are flagged so managers can easily correct them ensuring timesheets are error-free before payroll. Because Workforce.com is proactive in ironing out wage and hour issues beforehand payroll takes far less time than usual.

Attendance point system: Workforce.com is the only HCM that allows you to auto-assign points to employees whenever they are late or absent for a shift. Track the accumulation of these points and take corrective action according to company policy.

""Whether that is sort of your modern-day farmer or your traditional even Mennonite farmer they have cellphones and smartphones in their pocket"" Lennon the general manager of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture (OFA) said in a phone interview from her office in Guelph Ont.

She said there's an increasing amount of technology and data on farms and in the agricultural sector. But as farm equipment becomes more advanced and connected to the internet there also are concerns they'll become targets for cyberattacks something that could also put Canada's food security at risk.

Ali Dehghantanha is a computer scientist at the University of Guelph and the Canada Research Chair in cybersecurity and threat intelligence.

His Cyber Science Lab focuses on cybersecurity digital forensics threat hunting and threat intelligence. In the past year it has been called to investigate 11 cases of cyberattacks involving the farm industry. Dehghantanha said that a significant number.

He said the most common attacks involve ransomware where the attacker gains access to a computer system and data then asks for payment to release it back to the individual.

Ali Dehghantanha is a computer scientist at the University of Guelph and Canada Research Chair in cybersecurity and threat intelligence. He says anyone can be an easy target for hackers if devices aren't kept up to date. (University of Guelph)

""We have seen quite a few cases of the data leaks … and we normally find these data leakage as they are becoming available in the dark web for selling"" Dehghantanha said.

In some cases it's individuals doing the hacking. In other cases it can be state-sponsored hacking he said.

He said the majority of cyberattacks reported to his lab are conducted by criminal groups in Eastern Europe that are specifically attacking North American targets.

LISTEN | Expert says the agriculture industry needs to do more to protect tech and data.

Unsecure devices 'easy targets'

Hackers may not always be looking at the targets but people — farmers or otherwise — who don't keep their devices up to date or have security measures in place are ""weak targets"" Dehghantanha said.

""Unfortunately due to lack of any security standard or security guideline in [the agriculture] field we are seeing so many unpatched devices … they are easy targets for the hackers.""

Janos Botschner is the lead investigator for the Cyber Security Capacity in Canadian Agriculture project through the Community Safety Knowledge Alliance a non-profit that looks at ways to improve community safety and well-being.

The project is looking to help the sector prevent cyberattacks but also develop tools to help build cybersecurity in Canadian agriculture. Over the last two years the first-of-its-kind project has surveyed Canadian producers about cybersecurity.

Janos Botschner is lead investigator for the Cyber Security Capacity in Canadian Agriculture project through the Community Safety Knowledge Alliance. (Submitted by Janos Botschner)

""Digital ag cybersecurity is still in its infancy globally. So it's both a weakness and an opportunity for accelerated capacity building within the sector"" Botschner said.

He said for many the level of awareness around cybersecurity is ""not a priority among most producers"" at this point but it needs to be.

He pointed to recent cyber threats to the sector including a warning from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in April this year that included the United Kingdom and Australia. It warned agriculture co-operatives to be on high alert for ransomware attacks.

The threat of a cyberattack also hit home for farmers in Quebec last month when L'Union des producteurs agricoles (UPA) a farmers' union announced it was the victim of a ransomware attack on Aug. 7.

A statement on the union's website said it's still reviewing the scale of the attack and possible ways to restore its computer systems. The UPA noted ""day-to-day activities"" of agricultural businesses were not compromised and it was doing all it could to protect people's personal information.

Farm family networks often connected

For many people a ransomware attack impacts them on an individual level. But the attack can be a bigger problem for farmers Botschner said.

""Farm businesses are not like other businesses.""

An attack ""could have an impact on their farm business as well as on their farm family because … many networks are not segregated between the home and the agricultural operation.""

Lennon said she's also heard from farmers who reported a company they do business with had been attacked.

""People have had their names addresses and credit cards hacked when a local business was attacked and that certainly caused concern and awareness on the farm level about making sure that you are protecting that information.""

An attack could also 'sow mistrust'

But Botschner said cyberattacks can be more than ransomware or phishing for information. There could be attacks where information rather than physical computer systems is disrupted he said.

""You could see information being contaminated to either mask an event like an emerging biosecurity threat like a virus"" Bortschner said.

""Or you could see information being contaminated to suggest that something's happening that has contaminated a commodity in order to sow mistrust in a critical part of our ag food system. You could also see disinformation campaigns being rolled out to undermine trust in Canada's food system.""

Those kinds of attacks may not happen quickly — it could take years as part of a strategic campaign.

He said people should think of food security as national security.

""If farmers are under threat then so are the rest of us.""

Tips for farmers

Lennon said the OFA offers tech safety tips to members including:

Use strong passwords and a password manager.

Be careful about sharing personal information on social media.

Keep devices up to date.

The federation is planning an in-person annual general meeting in November when it will hold a workshop on protecting farmers from cyberattacks.

Cathy Lennon of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture says the OFA is working to teach farmers about how to protect themselves from cyberattacks. (Ontario Chamber of Commerce/occ.ca)

She said a key message to all farmers is that any device can be compromised.

""There's folks that have highly technical equipment in the barn or in their computers at home. GPS technology. It's the full range but if you are connected to the internet then the risk exists.""

Government tech companies can do more

Dehghantanha said while farmers themselves need to ensure they're protecting their data and devices regulators also have a role to play.

There's a need for a standard cybersecurity guideline for the agriculture industry ""so different people farmers technology providers service providers are at least aware of what [is the] security standard what security activities they should do and they should follow.""

Botschner agrees.

""Canadian producers are very adaptable. They're very good risk managers. They're good at noticing things that might involve risks and threats"" he said.

""But there are other things that need to be done to support farmers because they shouldn't be in it alone.""

He said governments and major tech companies can work together to help farmers improve their safety online while focusing on ensuring critical infrastructure is safeguarded from threats.

It's a sort of ""cyber barn raising"" he said ""to help one another tackle this important challenge in ways that make sense for producers and that really help the sector as a whole to be more resilient.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3Rlc3QtZm9yZC1icm9uY28tdG91Z2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Watch A Series Of Tests That Determine If The New Ford Bronco Is Really Built ""Ford-Tough""","ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3Rlc3QtZm9yZC1icm9uY28tdG91Z2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9rcGNuZXdzL25hbWUvbGF1cmVuLXBhcnItb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzY0MDQ4MzLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lauren Parr Obituary (1937 - 2022) - Auburn IN - KPCNews,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/kpcnews/name/lauren-parr-obituary?id=36404832 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9rcGNuZXdzL25hbWUvbGF1cmVuLXBhcnItb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzY0MDQ4MzLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Flights used to be a chance to sit back (albeit a bit cramped) and watch a recently released movie or catch up on some reading. Now they’re just another place to log on.

Delta and United each host more than 1.5 million inflight WiFi sessions a month the airlines told CNN Business while JetBlue said its service is used by “millions of customers” every year. Southwest declined to share specific numbers but said inflight Wifi is “popular.”

Alaska Airlines meanwhile estimates that about 35% of its passengers on average make use of its $8 onboard WiFi services which include surfing the web and streaming.

While most airlines will allow certain messaging apps for free full internet access in the skies usually comes at a premium with Delta charging nearly $50 for a monthly pass on US flights (though the airline plans to switch to a $5 per flight per device offering by the end of this year). But with a market that’s currently estimated at around $5 billion and projected to grow to more than $12 billion by 2030 according to research firm Verified Market Research there’s a lot of room for improvement.

Inflight internet has been around for nearly two decades with aircraft manufacturer Boeing announcing its service known as Connexion in April 2000 and debuting it on a Munich-Los Angeles Lufthansa flight in 2004. Boeing discontinued the service in 2006 saying the market for it had “not materialized” as expected. But the advent of smartphones and subsequent efforts by a host of satellite providers and airlines have helped the technology evolve significantly in the past decade — though it still has some catching up to do in order to compare to home and office networks.

How it works

There are two main types of inflight connections. The first known as air-to-ground or ATG relies on antennae attached to the aircraft that catch the signal from cellphone towers on the ground.

Intelsat which launched air-to-ground services with American Airlines in 2008 currently operates a version of the technology on more than 1000 aircraft across North America.

The one major drawback of this technology is that much like cellphone service on the ground it is dependent on the density and connectivity of towers and so flights over rural areas deserts or large water bodies are likely to suffer drops in connectivity. The maximum speeds for these systems are currently around 5 megabits per second (which is shared by hundreds of passengers) according to Andrew Zignani a research director at technology intelligence firm ABI Research who specializes in wireless connectivity. By comparison median global download speeds for mobile and fixed broadband are around 30 megabits per second and 67 megabits per second respectively according to recent data from monitoring app Speedtest.

“To date the biggest issues have been speed limited availability gaps in coverage dropouts and price” Zignani told CNN Business.

That’s why airlines and providers are increasingly switching to satellite-based connections that are relatively less susceptible to interruptions because they can more effectively cover the entirety of the flight path from space and keep the signal active as it moves through the air.

That includes Intelsat which has a network of over 50 satellites serving airlines such as Alaska American Delta United Air Canada British Airways and Cathay Pacific.

“As regional jet fleets are refreshed we expect the majority to migrate to satellite-based solutions” Jeff Sare Intelsat’s president of commercial aviation told CNN Business.

Viasat another major provider used by several airlines around the world uses its own network of satellites that provide high-speed connectivity and is gearing up to launch another satellite constellation later this year. The company debuted its services with JetBlue in 2013 and now serves more than a dozen airlines around the world.

But even satellite connections are currently capable of around 100 megabits per second per aircraft or around 15 megabits per second per passenger device a far cry from the speeds terrestrial WiFi is capable of.

Many airlines use a combination of WiFi providers and types of technologies depending on the type of aircraft and routes they need to be deployed on.

Newer players such as Starlink the satellite internet service run by billionaire Elon Musk’s company SpaceX are also entering the fray. Earlier this year SpaceX announced a partnership with Hawaiian Airlines to provide high-speed internet through Starlink’s network of low-earth orbit satellites.

“Some of these solutions also adopt a hybrid approach combining the best of both technologies to ensure optimal coverage depending on the specific flight path” said Zignani. “I believe we will see opportunities for all technologies in the coming years and recent partnerships are showing that each technology will have its own part to play” he added.

Challenges and opportunities

There are still gaps between inflight WiFi and the networks you would use in your home office a coffee shop or anywhere on the ground.

While most airline WiFi connections now support messaging and social media functions and some even have live TV and video streaming capabilities providing users with the same level of bandwidth and connectivity mid-air can be a challenge.

“The biggest point of difference for inflight WiFi is the complexity added by the mobility element” Don Buchman vice president and general manager for commercial aviation at Viasat told CNN Business. “The aircraft is traveling at a high rate of speed typically banking during the flight and often flying across large geographical areas that demand consistent coverage for a high-quality in-flight connectivity experience.”

And while satellites solve for some of the restrictions that cellphone towers face expanding the satellite network to keep up with increasing demand is not always straightforward.

As Sare of Intelsat puts it: “It is much faster and cheaper to deploy new cellular towers than to launch a satellite on a rocket.”

In a survey by Intelsat last year of airlines service providers and equipment manufacturers 65% of respondents said they anticipate increases in the number of passengers who expect to be connected while flying. The two biggest impediments to increasing inflight WiFi adoption the survey indicated were the high price of the service and “poor internet connection.”

Companies such as Viasat Intelsat and Starlink continue to expand that capacity however launching more satellites every year in anticipation of the growing demand for their services. That added capacity will not only enhance the online experience for users but could also potentially give airlines more avenues to monetize and lower the price.

“One example is ad sponsored inflight WiFi so passengers can access WiFi for free and use it however they would like” Buchman said adding that Viasat is also exploring ways to use its connectivity services to help airlines with functions such as crew management and aircraft maintenance.

The biggest priority according to Sare of Intelsat is shortening the time it takes to make those technological advances happen and he foresees more partnerships between companies to help move the industry standard forward.

“Our vision is achieved when passengers can’t tell the difference between being connected on the ground and in the air.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDQvYWlybGluZXMtcmV2YW1wLWluLWZsaWdodC1tZW51cy1mcm9tLXZlZ2FuLW1lYXRiYWxscy10by1pY2UtY3JlYW0tc3VuZGFlcy5odG1s0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjIvMDkvMDQvYWlybGluZXMtcmV2YW1wLWluLWZsaWdodC1tZW51cy1mcm9tLXZlZ2FuLW1lYXRiYWxscy10by1pY2UtY3JlYW0tc3VuZGFlcy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,From vegan meatballs to ice cream sundaes airlines are revamping in-flight menus,"Courtesy: Singapore Airlines

The aromas of airplane food are once again wafting through cabins at 35000 feet. From vegan meatballs to ice cream sundaes airlines are offering new options and old favorites to woo returning travelers. As the peak travel season fades and inflation weighs on household and company budgets it's even more important than usual for airlines to court passengers. Airplane food a favorite travel punchline for comedians is hardly the top reason why travelers choose a carrier — price and schedule are much stronger factors. But it can be a creature comfort on board and can go a long way toward winning over passengers especially those who are willing to pay up for premium seats analysts say. ""Food is one of the most tangible signals of what an airline thinks of its customers"" said Henry Harteveldt founder of travel consulting firm Atmosphere Research Group and a former airline executive. The start of the Covid-19 pandemic halted almost all food and beverage service on flights as travel collapsed and airlines limited crews' contact with passengers to avoid spreading the virus. The pandemic drove airlines to record losses and had them looking to cut costs wherever possible such as in-flight food. With travel returning airlines around the world are rolling out new menu options. Alcohol sales with some new ready-to-drink options are back on board in U.S. coach cabins. And face masks are now mostly optional removing an obstacle to onboard food and beverage service. As tastes change and airlines face supply chain challenges the meal on your seat-back tray table is making a comeback — with some adjustments.

Chasing high-paying travelers

Better in-flight menus can boost a carrier's image and help it bring more high-paying travelers on board. First- and business-class customers are becoming even more of a prize as airlines try to recover from the pandemic's financial impact. Because of ""the incentive to win those premium class passengers the incentive to spend more money [on food] is high"" said Steve Walsh partner at management consulting firm Oliver Wyman in its transportation and services practice. Still food and beverage costs make up just about 3% of a full-service airline's expenses he estimated.

While food is for sale in many domestic coach cabins and is generally complimentary on long-haul international flights many of the new offerings target those in premium classes where there are fewer passengers and service is more elaborate. A plethora of videos have been posted online by airline passengers reviewing meals plating and service in detail. Popular staples such as Biscoff cookies and Stroopwaffel treats garner loyal followings and come to be expected by many travelers. Missteps on the menu or service are amplified on social media by disappointed travelers. One offering: Delta is serving passengers on long-haul international flights a new sundae-in-a-cup premixed with chocolate cherries and spiced Belgian cookies called speculoos which are known in North America as Biscoff cookies. ""Obviously it is an homage to the Biscoff"" said Mike Henny Deltas' managing director of onboard services operations. In more premium cabins such as Delta One on international flights passengers can build their own sundaes with a choice of toppings including Morello cherry compote chocolate sauce and speculoos cookie crumbles.

Delta in July said the revenue recovery in premium products and its extra-legroom seats was outpacing sales from standard coach — further motivation to introduce new and exciting food items. Last week the airline said it is teaming up with James Beard Award winner Mashama Bailey executive chef of Savannah Georgia-based restaurant The Grey for ""Southern-inspired"" meals on flights out of Atlanta for domestic first-class passengers. Travelers on Delta One flying internationally out of the hub can also preorder menu items curated by Bailey. Airlines for years have teamed up with celebrity chefs to design their menus and lately have been working more with local businesses. In February American Airlines brought Tamara Turner's Silver Spoon Desserts' Bundt cakes on board domestic premium cabins.

Veggie and vegan

Even before the pandemic airlines were expanding options for travelers who prefer vegetarian and vegan meals. Now those types of alternative dishes are getting an even closer look. ""Pasta isn't always the solution"" said Delta's Henny. Singapore Airlines a carrier that operates some of the world's longest flights brought in Southern California-based luxury spa Golden Door to develop dozens of recipes for its in-flight menu. Golden Door's executive chef Greg Frey Jr. focuses on vegetable-forward dishes that he says are among the best for digestion on flights. ""I think people are rightly so concerned they're not going to feel as satiated with this vegetarian meal and [think] 'I just need this piece of meat.' And in the end ... you really don't need that much protein when you're sitting in an airplane and relaxing"" he said. ""It's not like you're heavy lifting.""

An hour later you're not going 'Ugh I wish I didn't have the meatballs.'"" Greg Frey Jr. executive chef at Golden Door

Frey developed a Portobello mushroom ""meat ball"" dish that's served with a risotto made with vegetable broth. The mushroom balls are steamed and served with an heirloom tomato sauce: ""There's not a lick of meat in there"" he said. ""It's so satisfying and you get all those umami flavors"" he said. ""The best part is an hour later you're not going 'Ugh I wish I didn't have the meatballs.'""

Supply chain puzzle

Greens and salads are among the most difficult dishes to serve on board. Airline chefs have to make sure ingredients are hardy enough to endure transportation and refrigeration making stronger greens such as kale a better option than some more delicate varieties. ""We have to be very choosy about what type of greens we offer"" said American Airlines spokeswoman Leah Rubertino. ""Arugula for example is not our friend."" The airline is offering salads on more flights compared with before the pandemic Rubertino said. The airline is also now offering a ""fiesta grain bowl"" with rice quinoa black beans cauliflower corn and zucchini as a vegetarian option in many first-class cabins for domestic flights. Airlines have been trying to source vegetables more locally giving their catering companies fresher ingredients and cutting down on transportation time and costs. Singapore Airlines since 2019 has been using greens from AeroFarms a vertical farm near Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. Spokesman James Boyd said the airline has plans to source from other vertical farms close to the major airports it serves in the coming years.

Amazon (AMZN 0.27%) is one of those stocks investors love to own and for good reason. Not only has it delivered incredible results since its initial public offering (growing over 131100%) but there's also loads of growth ahead for the company as online shopping expands.

There's a lot going for the stock over the long term but its size and popularity mean the company is trading at a premium around 116 times its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Thankfully investing directly in Amazon isn't the only way to benefit from the company's incredible e-commerce growth and market share.

Here are the stocks three Motley Fool contributors believe are great alternatives to Amazon: Digital Realty Trust (DLR -0.86%) Zillow Group (ZG 3.91%) (Z 4.34%) and Prologis (PLD 0.56%).

Exposure to data centers without the retail risk

Kristi Waterworth (Digital Realty Trust): Investing in Amazon means investing in various business models that converge under a single ticker. But not every Amazon investor is there for the retail streaming logistics and data-storage combo model. Some are simply looking for more ways to expose themselves to the growing world of data centers.

If you’re one of these investors the good news is that data-center real estate investment trusts (REITs) are a great way to get more direct exposure to data center growth without all the risk of retail tagging along for the ride.

Digital Realty Trust is a strong data center REIT with a proven track record and direct ties to Amazon. It leases a portion of its space to Amazon Web Services (AWS) Amazon’s data arm (and it services AWS by providing expanded capacity and connectivity to its customers).

Amazon also owns and develops its own data centers somewhat in competition with Digital Realty Trust but the latter still has an upper hand because it only deals in data centers giving it a larger and more diversified tenant base across a range of industries including other e-commerce companies.

And unlike Amazon Digital Realty Trust pays quarterly dividends estimated at $4.88 per share annually for 2022. This is up 5.17% over 2021 and its dividend payouts have only continued to climb since 2005 when they were a mere $1 per share annually.

Free cash flow has been more or less steady in 2021 and 2020 at about $1.7 billion but this is part of an upward trend that has been slowly building since 2012 when free cash flow was at a comparatively small $542 million. In that time Digital Realty Trust has been working to expand operations across the globe and now has over 300 data centers in more than 25 countries on six continents. This includes newly acquired data centers in emerging markets like South Africa and Israel.

Digital Realty Trust is one the REITs I am most bullish about not only because it has a grasp on the future and where and how it needs to grow to remain competitive but also because we live in an increasingly data-centric world where opportunities will only increase for data centers in the near term.

Unlike AWS Digital Realty Trust remains small enough to be fairly agile and to move quickly into emerging markets while still being a massive presence in the data center world.

Can Zillow become the Amazon of real estate buying?

Mike Price (Zillow): For the first several years of its business life Amazon was a bookseller. It sold a few other things too but the business was a lot more concentrated than it is today. Today the e-commerce giant makes money from AWS third-party sales advertising subscriptions physical stores and even books. And Zillow might be on the verge of its own transformation from a very concentrated revenue source into more-diversified business avenues.

Much of Zillow’s revenue comes from the buyer’s agent-referral commission. People go on the website to check out houses and click on a link for an agent in the area and use that agent. This is a very profitable revenue source and will likely continue to be the backbone of Zillow’s business for some time. But the company wants to diversify revenue streams.

Zillow is trying to get more involved in seller’s agent commissions mortgage originations and servicing closing services and rental services. Each of these areas could add a multiple to the amount of revenue that the company makes from every sale that begins on its website.

The good news is that the website already has traffic. There were 234 million average monthly unique users in the second quarter of 2022 and 2.9 billion total visits to the website.

The key will be converting those users from view-only to paying customers. There is certainly a demand for a service like the one Zillow could provide.

Today when looking for a house you have to find an agent get a list of available houses travel to each of them for a tour get pre-approved for a loan make an offer find an inspector be approved for the loan find a title insurance provider and lastly travel to the closing location to sign what seem like hundreds of pages of documents.

Now imagine if you could use a tailored Zillow search to virtually tour the houses you were interested in only visiting the ones that you would likely make an offer on. Then be pre-approved in minutes before the process even starts and be approved right on the app. Choose an inspector and title-insurance agent from a list of providers with customer reviews and ratings. And then close virtually on the same app to save all important documents right where you know they’ll be.

Part of the reason Amazon was able to grow as much as it has is the integration among its services. You can go to Amazon's website to buy anything you need read books watch shows rent movies and even publish your own books. If Zillow can become the same thing for real estate buyers it has a lot of room to run.

Back-end access to e-commerce distribution and logistics

Liz Brumer-Smith (Prologis): As the largest e-commerce company in the world Amazon needs a lot of industrial space to store and send its products quickly and efficiently. A huge part of Amazon's business is the management logistics and distribution of the products it sells.

That's where Prologis comes into the picture. It is the largest industrial operator in the world and Amazon is its largest tenant. As of the second quarter roughly 4.8% of Prologis' net effective rents came from Amazon thanks to the 33.6 million square feet of space it leases from the company.

Rumors were floating in late July about Amazon needing less logistics and industrial space based on its current supply which has put some pressure on Prologis' share price as of late. But the REIT's latest earnings call and the company's industrial-operations updates have put investors' concerns to rest. Amazon made up 21% of Prologis' newly executed leases in the second quarter. Plus its retention rate for spaces currently leased by Amazon was 95% 20 points higher than the portfolio average.

The really great thing with Prologis is that it isn't just an alternative way to invest in Amazon.

According to a report by The Times a UK-based couple found 264 gold coins under the floor of their kitchen. The North Yorkshire couple has decided to sell these ancient gold coins which are worth 250000 pounds ( ₹2.3 crore). The collection which is reportedly more than 400 years old will be sold through an auction which is being handled by Spink & Son.

The surprising discovery was made when the couple lifted the floorboard of their 18th-century detached property in the village of Ellerby. Initially the couple thought they had hit an electric cable when they lifted the floor. But they found a stash of coins inside a metal about the same size as a coke can buried just six inches under the concrete. The couple has been staying in that house for the past 10 years.

When the couple inspected the stash they found that the coins were dated from 1610 to 1727 during the reigns of James I and Charles I.

In a separate incident 86 gold coins were found in Madhya Pradesh's Dhar district in August this year. Eight labourers allegedly stole 86 gold coins worth about ₹60 lakh found by them during the demolition of an old house in Madhya Pradesh.

The labourers then distributed the 'ginnis' (gold coins) which may be of archaeological importance among themselves without informing local police following which they were arrested Additional Superintendent of Police Devendra Patidar said.

He said the labourers found the coins while removing the debris of an old house a few days back. Following a tip-off the police came to know that the eight labourers distributed the coins among themselves he said.

The police arrested these labourers and seized 86 coins collectively weighing around one kilogram.

The price of those coins is about ₹60 lakh but it may go up to ₹one crore after ascertaining their archaeological significance.

Context: New ‘Strive and Rise Programme’ to fight cross-generational poverty

Start-up sum of HK$5000 will be handed out to 2000 students who will also be paired with life-planning mentors

Chief Secretary Eric Chan Kwok-ki is leading a pilot “Strive and Rise Programme” aimed to help underprivileged pupils expand their social networks build communication skills and plan their finances and careers. The scheme is set to launch in October and expected to last a year.

The subsidy scheme is part of the new government’s efforts to alleviate poverty. According to Chan under the first phase of the subsidy scheme a start-up sum of HK$5000 will be given to 2000 Form One to Three students who live in subdivided flats. If more than 2000 applications are received preference will be given to Form Three students.

“Some may ask why only 2000 students will benefit. This is a trial programme. We will expand it to cover more students after an ongoing review” Chan said.

Hong Kong’s new scheme to mentor pupils living in subdivided flats

Authorities will invite commercial organisations and professional bodies to nominate mentors. Students in the programme will be recruited through community groups and schools. Mentors will help pupils with planning their lives and making the best use of the subsidies donated by the business sector.

“We hope to recruit more younger mentors because they can communicate better with the mentees. They should have a job and can arrange job shadowing” Chan said. “We hope the mentors can also be able to share with their mentees how they faced difficulties in order to help mentees develop a positive attitude.”

Upon completion of the programme another HK$5000 will be awarded to students to fund their personal pursuits.

Activities for pupils would include group visits to public utilities government departments and museums. There are also plans for them to take a short flight. Participants will also undergo compulsory training in areas such as communication skills and financial planning. Mentors and parents will also be given training. Pupils can choose to take classes in Chinese or English language sports and music as well as social etiquette.

News: Hong Kong Olympic medal winners to act as tutors under new scheme

Hong Kong Olympic medallists among mentors in “Strive and Rise” scheme

Scheme serves as “short- to medium-term subsidy” rather than long-term support Form Three pupil says

Four Hong Kong Olympic medallists have been invited to act as tutors to junior secondary school pupils living in subdivided flats under a new scheme to tackle cross-generational poverty.

They are fencing gold medallist Edgar Cheung Ka-long and women’s table tennis team members Doo Hoi-kam Minnie Soo Wai-yam and Lee Ho-ching who took home a bronze at the 2020 Tokyo Games.

“These star tutors will increase the attractiveness of the scheme so that grass-roots students will no longer feel that their development will be restricted by their network” he said.

Others who have agreed to join the scheme as tutors are Dr Lo Yuen-yi the University of Hong Kong’s associate dean of faculty of education Hong Kong Harmonica Association founder Ho Pak-cheong renowned conductor Yip Wing-sze and violinist Yao Jue.

Form Three pupil Kelly Lee said she was interested in joining the scheme but its quota was too small the duration too short and the HK$10000 subsidy too little.

“This is not a form of long-term support it is more of a short- to medium-term subsidy” said the 14-year-old who lives in a subdivided flat.

What it’s like for a teen from a poor family caring for diabetic father

Using her violin lessons as an example she said a new instrument would cost at least HK$10000 and the average fee for a class was around HK$300 to HK$400.

She said she hoped the scheme would help her to plan her future career path and to visit events and places she had rarely been to such as concerts or theme parks.

Separately Sze Lai-shan deputy director of the Society for Community Organisation said the scheme was a move in the right direction but the one-year period was not long enough for mentors and mentees to develop a relationship. Sze added that the subsidy should be increased to HK$20000 per student and more pupils should be allowed to join.

Issue: Scheme for disadvantaged Hong Kong youth does not go far enough experts say

Academics warn “Strive and Rise” scheme will not tackle problems of intergenerational poverty on its own

More long-term commitment needed to ensure underprivileged children are lifted out of poverty cycle

The “Strive and Rise Programme” designed to help lift struggling Hong Kong secondary school pupils out of poverty is “half-baked” experts have said.

Academics and social workers insisted that the government-organised scheme was not enough on its own and other major problems such as the housing crisis and low incomes had to be tackled as well.

“There must be elements of continuity in the scheme” said Amy Chan Kung Wai-ying the chairwoman of the Child Development Matching Fund a charity that has worked with the government to deliver similar programmes since 2009. “The government should provide a ladder for them and also keep helping them move up along the way.”

According to Chan the scheme was too career-focused for such young children and the programme would not achieve its aims without follow-up measures. She appealed to authorities to allocate resources for continued support to the secondary pupils involved who would need guidance for several years.

Experts have also blamed worsening intergenerational poverty on the city’s growing income gap soaring cost of living and limited help programmes.

Lee Chun-wing a social sciences lecturer at Polytechnic University accused the government of a lack of new ideas and follow-up measures. “It’s a half-baked plan as the government delivered no new ideas and no solid plans on tracking the progress of students” he said.

Why low-income Hongkongers are being pushed from one temporary flat to another

Lee said authorities tended to attribute intergenerational poverty to youngsters’ lack of social skills and limited opportunities but the problem’s causes were more complex. He explained there was a critical need to review the city’s employment structure to close the poverty gap and boost the incomes of low-paid workers.

Lee also appealed for more immediate measures to be taken to improve living conditions for poorer schoolchildren so they had a suitable home environment to concentrate on their studies.

Sample answers

Context:

Why is the “Strive and Rise Programme” only applicable to students who live in subdivided flats? Use Glossary and your own knowledge to explain. (It is because this group of people are living in poverty and are likely to have the least financial means and access to the activities provided in the scheme. They are also more likely to face financial or other sorts of difficulties in their lives and they will benefit from the mentors’ advice.

Which of the activities mentioned in Context do you think would benefit recipients of the scheme and why? (Training in terms of communication skills and financial planning because they will most likely be unable to afford such classes otherwise. These skills are also crucial for future success.)

News:

Do you think recruiting the four Hong Kong Olympians as mentors increases the attractiveness of the scheme? Explain. (Yes these athletes are inspirational figures for the city’s youth and they have each excelled in their respective sports. All of them are also under 30 and they will be able to better relate to the mentees.)

Why does Kelly Lee say the programme is “more of a short- to medium-term subsidy” than long-term support? Use Context News and Glossary to explain. (Having only 2000 spots is not enough to help the city’s 275000 youth living in poverty. HK$10000 is also too little to fund worthwhile pursuits such as enrolling in enrichment classes or starting their own business ventures. At the end of the day none of this addresses the root causes of their struggles.)

Issue:

What does Amy Chan mean when she says there must be “elements of continuity in the scheme”? Explain your answer using News and Issue. (She means that the “Strive and Rise Programme” should not simply be a one-year subsidy scheme and its duration should be extended to that of a long-term programme. This way students’ progress can be tracked to ensure that they truly benefit from it. As mentioned by Kelly Lee in News even though she is interested in the scheme the duration is barely enough for her to explore the possibility of a future career in music.)

Using your own knowledge and Glossary explain how widening income gap soaring cost of living and lack of help programmes cause intergenerational poverty. (Intergenerational poverty is passed on from one generation to the next. A widening income gap combined with soaring cost of living means that low-wage workers are not paid enough to maintain basic needs. If a parent does not make enough money to pay for rent for example then their children may struggle to focus on their studies when their home environment is unstable. These individuals may rely on the government to provide financial assistance but when there are not enough help programmes they have no choice but to fend for themselves.)

This happened at 5 p.m. at the location on South Main Street in Hampstead.

The fire was so big that firefighters from Carroll Baltimore and York counties were on the scene and it took more than an hour to get it under control.

According to the Hampstead Volunteer Fire Department one firefighter was evaluated on scene for an injury but was not taken to the hospital. No other injuries were reported. It caused $2.5 million worth of damage to the store.

Now investigators are looking for two witnesses who may have seen something before the fire was discovered. The State Fire Marshal's office believes they are a mother and son. They showed up to the store just before 5 p.m. in a dark possibly green early model GMC safari van.

TikTok user iloveqpons picked up $32 worth of supplies from Dollar General but spent just $10.96 after applying coupons.

1 TikTok user iloveqpons picked up this cart full of items for less than $11

Tori who runs the account ultimately paid $1.56 per item for seven products from Gain and Febreze.

She posted a video explaining the exact offers she capitalized on to score her discount and said other shoppers can try it any day.

All of the coupons Tori used came from Dollar General's app.

The app includes hundreds of coupons for specific items and brands as well as general discounts that can knock $5 or $10 off your whole order.

To score her deal on cleaning products Tori first picked up two bottles of Gain Powerblast Spray for $4.75 each and clipped a $3.99 coupon.

Next she picked up a 65-ounce bottle of laundry detergent for $7.50 but knocked $2 off the price with another offer.

She also got a smaller cheaper bottle of detergent spending just $4.50 for a 45-ounce bottle after applying a $1 coupon.

Finally Tori grabbed two bottles of Febreze air freshener and a Febreze Small Spaces aromatic for $3.25 each all of which came with Gain scents.

She then used coupons to save $3.30 on the spray and $1 on the Small Spaces freshener.

All told these offers knocked more than $10 off her purchase.

In addition to the product coupons Tori took advantage of a deal offering $5 off a purchase of $30 or more of Gain products.

Since everything in her cart was from Gain she knocked her subtotal even further from $20.96 to $15.96.

Her receipt also came with a $5 off coupon for her next purchase of more than $5.01.

With the cashback she ended up spending slightly less than $11 for the seven products.

Most of the coupons Tori used expire on September 24 except for the $1 detergent deal that ends on September 3.

Why would they want to move next to Five Below? — Vanessa E.

You pose a logical question Vanessa but there is actually a logical reason. Several actually.

For background a week or so back The Burn reported that the discount chain Dollar Tree is planning on opening a new store in the former Jo-Ann Fabrics space at Potomac Run Plaza in Sterling. There is a Five Below discount store in the space next door. You can see that story here.

In the comments on the report several people expressed surprise — thinking that the two discount retailers so close together would just hurt each other in the battle for customers and their dollars. But that’s often not the way businesses see it.

Did you know many new restaurants actually seek out spaces near a Chipotle or a Chick-fil-A or a Starbucks. Or think about how car dealerships often seem to be grouped together.

According to commercial retail experts The Burn has spoken with there are several reasons that similar businesses often like to locate near each other. We’ll mention a couple of them.

One — if another similar business (restaurant discount retailer etc.) has succeeded in a location that likely means there is a customer base in that area. So the question of “will customers come” has already been answered.

Two — in the case of restaurants a new fast-casual eatery knows you won’t go to Chipotle or Chick-fil-a every single day so they figure some days you will come to them. It’s the synergy of being by other similar businesses that they want to capture.

While we can’t read the minds of the site selection people at Dollar Tree it’s likely that they knew full well a Five Below was next door and they want to share in that synergy — tapping into the same customer base Five Below has already developed.

They expect people will now come to both stores and potentially make purchases at both locations. Discount shoppers frequently love hunting around for a bargain.

Especially when they’re trying to get you to ignore store policy.

In a re-enactment video that racked up over 108000 views a thorny Dollar Tree customer doesn’t understand that the store doesn’t do returns. The clip from user @theactnklass features her voice as she films her checkout stand. Immediately @theactnklass and the customer are off to a bad start when she asks how the customer is doing and she responds with “I’m returning it.”

“We don’t do returns at Dollar Tree” the TikToker says.

The conversation goes in circles with both the TikToker and customer arguing about returns. The customer can’t wrap her mind around the fact Dollar Tree doesn’t do returns alleging other stores do. Over and over again @theactnklass explains Dollar Tree doesn’t do returns as it’s against store policy.

“Dollar Tree policy is you have to do an exchange to get money back” @theactnklass explains.

@theactnklass gets a manager involved who reinforces what the TikToker said. The customer doesn’t understand this and the TikToker offers to explain in “elementary terms.” This ignites another dispute as the customer now says that @theactnklass is rude.

The issue is finally resolved when the customer asks for her items—and heads off to another Dollar Tree.

According to the replies from @theactnklass in the comments section this is was just a reenactment explaining how she creates “relatable content.”

“a real reenactment” she wrote “thank you we appreciate you watching though we CREATE relatable content.”

However many people in the comments believed this was real and still sided with the TikToker.

“Omg why are people so difficult?” one user asked.

“she wanted a problem” a second said.

“Why do people have to be so mean and problematic?! They DON’T do returns!” a third commented.

“I was an assistant manager at dollar tree I hated these type of people . Literally says at the bottom of the receipt lol” a fourth stated.

Despite the video being staged the Dollar Tree policy is real. According to its website the store doesn’t offer refunds and “all sales are final.” However it will do exchanges if the item is unopened and the customer has the original receipt. The same thing applies to online orders: If the transaction is incomplete or the items are damaged Dollar Tree will fix the problem.

The Daily Dot reached out to @theactnklass for comment via TikTok comment."

The dishwasher in my humble opinion is one of the greatest modern inventions. It frees you from handwashing every last dish (if you enjoy cooking you probably know firsthand how easily they stack up in the throes of dinner prep) leaving more time for the good stuff: eating dessert or cuddling up on the couch after a meal. It’s also an appliance that’s nearly impossible to live without if you’ve experienced having one—it’s why nearly every home and apartment search website includes a filter for dishwashers.

That said they’re a mixed bag and the difference between a sparkling new dishwasher and the landlord special is pretty significant. The one thing that helps close the gap? A high-quality dishwasher detergent. I tested several for you so the only thing standing between you and crystal-clear glasses is a couple clicks. Read on for the best dishwasher detergent from my trials plus four other eco-friendly options that stack up.

Our Favorite

Dishwasher Starter Set (40 Tablets) Blueland ($25) Shop

Count: 60 | Type: Powder tabs | Packaging: Reusable lidded tin

What we like: Natural clearly listed ingredients

Comparable performance to natural and traditional detergents

Space-saving reusable tin Worth noting: No fragrance

Why we chose it: These dishwasher tablets are made with plant-based ingredients come with a just-right-size reusable container and work hard to remove stuck-on crud.

There are few things more disappointing or downright gross than pulling glassware and utensils out of the dishwasher with grease peanut butter and lip marks still on them. After all isn’t the point of a dishwasher to remove those things so you don’t have to? Happily Blueland dishwasher tablets leave no such guck—they get the job done right the first time. Even more enticing is that these tablets are made from just 11 ingredients all of which are naturally derived and easily explained in terms of purpose. For example sodium carbonate acts as a mineral-based cleaner; sodium citrate is a water softener; and citric acid helps the tablets dissolve smoothly without leftover clumps.

Indeed there are no clumps to be found since they’re not made with dissolving shells or wrappers so all the tablets are put to work cleaning dishes without leaving waste. Their performance is comparable to the other natural detergents we tested as well as big-name brands like Cascade and Finish. They are free of fragrance though which is a win if you’re sensitive to smells but might leave you wanting if you’re accustomed to a scented detergent. Arguably the best part though? They come in a completely adorable lidded tin which can be endlessly reused and refilled. Small and sturdy the container easily stashes under the sink unlike floppy sacks or clunky plastic boxes. Refill tablets come in recyclable paper packaging (which you can subscribe to for quick refills).

We Also Like

Mrs. Meyer’s Dishwasher Tabs: As longtime fans of Mrs. Meyer’s products we found these dishwasher tabs to be perfectly functional. They come in three of the classic Mrs. Meyer’s scents—lemon verbena basil and lavender—so you can coordinate (or mix) with your dish and hand soap as well. One note we will make: The tabs are quite heavily fragranced so if you’re prone to headaches from strong scents you might want to skip these.

Grove Co. Pure Power Dishwasher Detergent Packs: We love that Grove Co. is a certified B Corp and stocks tons of our favorite natural and eco-friendly cleaning brands but its own line of products performs just as well as the heavy hitters.

Dropps Dishwasher Detergent Pods: Perhaps best known for its irreverent ads on Instagram Dropps makes a variety of naturally derived cleaning products in compostable packaging. The unscented detergent pods are great but the fresh rain ones are even better.

Method Dishwasher Pacs: A Target staple Method makes some of our favorite budget cleaning products from dish soap to shower cleaner.

How We Chose These Products

When looking for dishwasher detergents to test there were a few criteria that kept the list down. First they are all pods or tabs. While liquid detergents are still available they’re not produced in nearly the same capacity as pods and tabs are given the convenience of tossing one into the dishwasher and pressing start. Second all the detergents we tested are made with identifiable clearly labeled ingredients ideally in reusable packaging. We tested each by running them through a standard dishwashing cycle with the same approximate level of debris and dishes to compare performance.

Our Shopping Checklist

Ingredients and Scent

While there are certainly more long-standing brands of dishwasher detergent that have proven themselves over time many of them don’t clearly disclose their ingredients which is troubling given that they’re used to clean the dishes we eat from. All of the detergents we tested clearly list their ingredients including familiar ones such as citric acid sodium carbonate and plant-derived ingredients like sodium citrate. There are free-and-clear versions of most of the detergents but for this test we opted to test the naturally fragranced ones (if available) to compare scents and to understand from where the fragrance was derived.

Packaging

Most detergent pods come in plastic boxes or soft plastic packaging neither of which is our favorite. A majority of the detergents we tested came in zip-top plastic bags which are fine but not the best solution since they are difficult to get standing upright and are prone to spilling from the top. Dropps detergent packs actually come in well-designed cardboard boxes that can be recycled post-use which is a clever method but our favorite packaging goes to Blueland because the reusable lidded tin is just so adorable functional and easy to refill.

Performance

Here’s the thing: Dishwashers are a total gamble. The discrepancies between them are pretty large—i.e. you might live in a rental with an old basic model or a home with a new state-of-the-art appliance—so it’s difficult to say how well each of these detergents will perform in every different environment. That said each of these was run through the same cleaning cycle with the same approximate level of debris and dishes and they all performed quite well.

Ask Domino

Q: What’s the difference between pods and liquid detergent?

Detergent pods or tablets are more concentrated than liquid or gel detergents which means they deliver a more powerful clean without taking up nearly as much space in your cabinet. Because they’re more concentrated tabs and pods also require less water less packaging and less energy to ship. In terms of cleaning abilities a majority of experts cite tablets and pods as the most efficient and powerful option and liquid detergents simply don’t compare.

Q: Can I use regular dish soap in a dishwasher?

No! Dish soap used to clean dishes by hand is made in a totally different way than dishwasher detergent. Just a drop of dish soap can produce tons of suds which can overflow and create quite a big mess under and around your dishwasher. Dishwasher detergent on the other hand is designed not to produce suds so it won’t leave soapy chaos in its wake.

The Last Word

Naturally derived dishwasher detergents are now just as powerful as the mainstay brands without ingredient secrecy and harsh scents. Our favorite dishwasher detergent comes in tablet form from Blueland; each one is adept at cutting through grease and stuck-on food.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZm1hbHRhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3VzLWxhc3QtaW52ZXN0bWVudC1kb21pbm8tZmFsbC45Nzg1MzDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why the US might be the last investment domino to fall,"With runaway inflation and the Ukraine war wreaking havoc on the global economy the US market could well be the last to offer investors any real opportunities argues Jesmond Mizzi Financial Advisors’ Chief Investment Officer Marc El-Lazidi.

Earlier this year you hosted a webinar entitled “Fishing for performance in troubled waters”. Since then war has broken out in Europe and central banks around the world are scrambling to control spiralling inflation which is threatening a global recession. Would you say those waters are more troubled today?

Yes definitely. Inflation has been creeping up for quite a while now and along with supply chain challenges it was already a consideration at the start of the year. But the war now has taken things to a whole new level.

In that webinar you pointed out that a ‘buy the dips’ strategy had been the most effective during 2020 and 2021 but you questioned whether this would still be the case in 2022. Is it?

The declines we’ve seen across the markets have resulted in some losses for investors but they’ve also created opportunities. We’ve seen a lot of money flow through the system over the last couple of years and this created an environment where a company’s balance sheet was less predictive of the true value of its shares.

It’s a climate that makes it reasonable to assume that whatever goes down will at some point come back up. When the money starts to dry up it starts to become a lot clearer which companies are over-valued. Our standard practice is always to perform a deep dive into the balance sheet of the companies we are investing in but it becomes so much more important at these moments. When everything is dipping you need to be more selective about which dips you buy but if you know what you’re doing you could see significant returns. This is especially true of the US market.

How would you sum up your investment strategy?

At the end of the day the job of a portfolio manager is to find the right balance in allocation between defensive bonds and other bonds that allow us to offer decent yields to our clients.The emphasis however is on long-term investments and not chasing short-term profits. We take a dynamic and pragmatic approach in everything we do while also emphasising the importance of risk management. We always make sure that any decision to invest is backed by a stable balance sheet and healthy cash flow. This has been somewhat difficult over the last couple of years because you had a situation where stimulus packages and government COVID-19 support schemes added a lot of noise to the data making it harder to find the signal.

What are the advantages of investing in the US market over others?

It mostly just boils down to the US dollar being the dominant global currency and one which is a long way from being challenged. The US offers a much more generous corporate environment when compared to Europe or other markets with companies having significantly fewer obligations towards their employees.

Perhaps what makes the US stand out from the rest is the pervasive culture of entrepreneurship and an economic policy aimed at maximising growth and employment more than anything else. There is also a reality that you often get better returns on US dollar-denominated assets because they tend to be priced more fairly given the vast number of investment opportunities available. We’re currently in the midst of an economic downturn that has been caused to some degree by several supposedly once-in-a-lifetime events which have all taken place in the last couple of years. Given both its geographic position and the nature of its economy the US is relatively shielded from most of the geopolitical tensions resulting from the war and might just be the last domino to fall.

Are there any asset classes that are particularly good value for money in this particular moment?

I would say bonds offer the best shelter during times of volatility because they are able to absorb short-term shocks and are thus more resilient. Equity markets on the other hand carry more risk because it is more difficult to make predictions about how private companies will perform during volatile times. This doesn’t mean that there are no opportunities in equities but you need to be a daily professional trader with years of experience and with the discipline required to meticulously navigate this noise and ultimately find the day’s signal.

In general I would say that at this given moment the best instrument an investor can have in his portfolio is a high seniority bond in the non-cyclical sector like the pharmaceutical industry. At the end of the day the job of a portfolio manager is to find the right balance in allocation between this type of defensive bond and other bonds that allow us to offer decent yields to our clients – not an easy task given the dynamic nature of the current market conditions.

Is there any currency you think has the potential to compete with the dollar?

The only other currency that comes close to competing with the dollar is the Euro though it faces far more instability as a result of various headwinds it will face in the short to medium term. In addition to the ongoing war and its immediate effects the bloc is also facing issues related to fiscal and monetary policy global supply chain challenges and an energy crisis which will only get worse as the winter sets in. The European Central Bank is set to launch a new set of instruments that will hopefully address some of the union’s issues but the reality is that there are far more variables when considering the European market than you have in the US. The nature of the European Union also means different member states could have opposing interests leading to a lack of synergy.

Chief Investment Officer Marc El-Lazidi.

So while the Euro could have the potential to challenge the dollar in the future the present reality is that the US market remains the most liquid and one which is simply too big to ignore. Another potential competitor is cryptocurrencies which could potentially compete with the dollar as a store of value especially if its adoption and acceptance by central banks continues to spread across the globe like we’ve seen in South America. But again I can’t see it challenging the dollar any time soon.

Flights used to be a chance to sit back (albeit a bit cramped) and watch a recently released movie or catch up on some reading. Now they’re just another place to log on.

Delta and United each host more than 1.5 million inflight WiFi sessions a month the airlines told CNN Business while JetBlue said its service is used by “millions of customers” every year. Southwest declined to share specific numbers but said inflight Wifi is “popular.”

Alaska Airlines meanwhile estimates that about 35% of its passengers on average make use of its $8 onboard WiFi services which include surfing the web and streaming.

While most airlines will allow certain messaging apps for free full internet access in the skies usually comes at a premium with Delta charging nearly $50 for a monthly pass on US flights (though the airline plans to switch to a $5 per flight per device offering by the end of this year). But with a market that’s currently estimated at around $5 billion and projected to grow to more than $12 billion by 2030 according to research firm Verified Market Research there’s a lot of room for improvement.

Inflight internet has been around for nearly two decades with aircraft manufacturer Boeing announcing its service known as Connexion in April 2000 and debuting it on a Munich-Los Angeles Lufthansa flight in 2004. Boeing discontinued the service in 2006 saying the market for it had “not materialized” as expected. But the advent of smartphones and subsequent efforts by a host of satellite providers and airlines have helped the technology evolve significantly in the past decade — though it still has some catching up to do in order to compare to home and office networks.

How it works

There are two main types of inflight connections. The first known as air-to-ground or ATG relies on antennae attached to the aircraft that catch the signal from cellphone towers on the ground.

Intelsat which launched air-to-ground services with American Airlines in 2008 currently operates a version of the technology on more than 1000 aircraft across North America.

The one major drawback of this technology is that much like cellphone service on the ground it is dependent on the density and connectivity of towers and so flights over rural areas deserts or large water bodies are likely to suffer drops in connectivity. The maximum speeds for these systems are currently around 5 megabits per second (which is shared by hundreds of passengers) according to Andrew Zignani a research director at technology intelligence firm ABI Research who specializes in wireless connectivity. By comparison median global download speeds for mobile and fixed broadband are around 30 megabits per second and 67 megabits per second respectively according to recent data from monitoring app Speedtest.

“To date the biggest issues have been speed limited availability gaps in coverage dropouts and price” Zignani told CNN Business.

That’s why airlines and providers are increasingly switching to satellite-based connections that are relatively less susceptible to interruptions because they can more effectively cover the entirety of the flight path from space and keep the signal active as it moves through the air.

That includes Intelsat which has a network of over 50 satellites serving airlines such as Alaska American Delta United Air Canada British Airways and Cathay Pacific.

“As regional jet fleets are refreshed we expect the majority to migrate to satellite-based solutions” Jeff Sare Intelsat’s president of commercial aviation told CNN Business.

Viasat another major provider used by several airlines around the world uses its own network of satellites that provide high-speed connectivity and is gearing up to launch another satellite constellation later this year. The company debuted its services with JetBlue in 2013 and now serves more than a dozen airlines around the world.

But even satellite connections are currently capable of around 100 megabits per second per aircraft or around 15 megabits per second per passenger device a far cry from the speeds terrestrial WiFi is capable of.

Many airlines use a combination of WiFi providers and types of technologies depending on the type of aircraft and routes they need to be deployed on.

Newer players such as Starlink the satellite internet service run by billionaire Elon Musk’s company SpaceX are also entering the fray. Earlier this year SpaceX announced a partnership with Hawaiian Airlines to provide high-speed internet through Starlink’s network of low-earth orbit satellites.

“Some of these solutions also adopt a hybrid approach combining the best of both technologies to ensure optimal coverage depending on the specific flight path” said Zignani. “I believe we will see opportunities for all technologies in the coming years and recent partnerships are showing that each technology will have its own part to play” he added.

Challenges and opportunities

There are still gaps between inflight WiFi and the networks you would use in your home office a coffee shop or anywhere on the ground.

While most airline WiFi connections now support messaging and social media functions and some even have live TV and video streaming capabilities providing users with the same level of bandwidth and connectivity mid-air can be a challenge.

“The biggest point of difference for inflight WiFi is the complexity added by the mobility element” Don Buchman vice president and general manager for commercial aviation at Viasat told CNN Business. “The aircraft is traveling at a high rate of speed typically banking during the flight and often flying across large geographical areas that demand consistent coverage for a high-quality in-flight connectivity experience.”

And while satellites solve for some of the restrictions that cellphone towers face expanding the satellite network to keep up with increasing demand is not always straightforward.

As Sare of Intelsat puts it: “It is much faster and cheaper to deploy new cellular towers than to launch a satellite on a rocket.”

In a survey by Intelsat last year of airlines service providers and equipment manufacturers 65% of respondents said they anticipate increases in the number of passengers who expect to be connected while flying. The two biggest impediments to increasing inflight WiFi adoption the survey indicated were the high price of the service and “poor internet connection.”

Companies such as Viasat Intelsat and Starlink continue to expand that capacity however launching more satellites every year in anticipation of the growing demand for their services. That added capacity will not only enhance the online experience for users but could also potentially give airlines more avenues to monetize and lower the price.

“One example is ad sponsored inflight WiFi so passengers can access WiFi for free and use it however they would like” Buchman said adding that Viasat is also exploring ways to use its connectivity services to help airlines with functions such as crew management and aircraft maintenance.

The biggest priority according to Sare of Intelsat is shortening the time it takes to make those technological advances happen and he foresees more partnerships between companies to help move the industry standard forward.

“Our vision is achieved when passengers can’t tell the difference between being connected on the ground and in the air.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vcml2ZXJoZWFkbmV3c3Jldmlldy50aW1lc3Jldmlldy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8xMTI0MDEvZmllbGQtaG9ja2V5LXlvdW5nLXdhdmVzLXRha2UtbGVzc29uLWZyb20td2FyZC1tZWx2aWxsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Field Hockey: Young Waves take lesson from Ward Melville - Riverhead News Review,"Charlotte Dow an all-division player last year is Riverhead’s only returning starter. (Credit: George A. Faella)

For almost half of the players on the Riverhead roster this was their introduction to high school varsity field hockey. Girls meet Ward Melville.

Yes that Ward Melville.

Mighty Ward Melville.

The Ward Melville that reached the Suffolk County Class A final last year. The Ward Melville that is seeded second this year in Suffolk Division I. The Ward Melville that is one of the best teams in the county.

Under just about any circumstances that would be a rough way to christen a season. But taking things a few steps further consider where Riverhead is.

Cheryl Walsh-Edwards said this is the youngest and least experienced of the Riverhead teams she has coached in her 23 years in charge. The Blue Waves seeded 14th among Division I’s 22 teams return only one starter Charlotte Dow from the 2021 team that went 6-8 and barely missed making the playoffs.

Dow is one of only three seniors Vanessa Leon and Ashley Monticciolo being the others. Aside from Dow the only other players with any varsity experience before this year are Kerry Stavracos Morgan Stromski Isabella Vene and Leon. Three players — Emma Kennedy Kyleigh Lennon and Abigail Maaiki — have made the Herculean leap from middle school field hockey straight to the varsity.

And if all that isn’t enough this is the smallest roster Walsh-Edwards has ever had: 15 players.

So enter Ward Melville into the equation Friday at Pulaski Sports Complex and do the math. It added up to a 6-0 Ward Melville win. For a start-of-the-season test this was the field hockey version of an advanced algebra pop quiz on the first day of school.

With only one scrimmage against Southampton behind them the Blue Waves took the field against Ward Melville. “I was shaking” said Lennon.

Walsh-Edwards in a pregame interview said her players were “very excited but again you know it’s like I’ve never had a team where the bulk of them have never played in a varsity game so I don’t think they quite know what to expect.”

She added “You can’t even compare JV to varsity. The speed of the game is just totally different.”

Ward Melville boxed Riverhead in its own half of the field for virtually the entire first quarter. It took only 3 minutes 53 seconds before Alexa Kidd scored the first of her three goals off a scramble with the goalie Stavracos on the ground. Kyra Gianelli (assisted by Grace Mulham) and Peyton Phillips followed with goals to give the girls in green a 3-0 lead through 15 minutes.

Riverhead showed improvement in the second quarter but still conceded goals by Kidd and Julia Rotoli in the final 23.5 seconds of the quarter for a 5-0 score by halftime.

In a show of sportsmanship Ward Melville coach Shannon Sioss had her team ease off and not press the attack in the second half. Kidd scored her third goal off a pass from Phillips with 20 seconds left.

Ward Melville took 20 shots (Stavracos saved 11 of them) and earned 20 penalty corners while holding Riverhead without a shot or a penalty corner.

“Well I knew it was gonna be a tough game but I think the main focus of the game was to improve” said Dow.

As one of the players making the huge jump from middle school to varsity Lennon said: “There’s a big difference like the game was much faster. There’s a lot more running. It’s a lot more but I think we played good considering they’re one of the better teams.”

Riverhead has a true asset in Dow. An all-division forward last year Dow has been moved to center midfield where her high work rate is being put to use. “It’s a lot more running” she said.

Walsh-Edwards spelled out what she is looking for from her young players. “To me it’s just going out and working really hard and not giving up you know regardless of what the score is” she said. “That’s the most important thing to me build the character a little bit and you got to play until the end of the game you know and some games you are gonna win and some you’re not.”

All things considered Dow said “I think for our first game of the season it was exceptional and we definitely have a good season ahead of us a lot to improve upon and I can’t wait to see us at the end [of the season] and how good we become.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wMy90ZWNoL2FpLWFydC1mYWlyLXdpbm5lci1jb250cm92ZXJzeS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFGaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wOS8wMy90ZWNoL2FpLWFydC1mYWlyLXdpbm5lci1jb250cm92ZXJzeQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AI won an art contest and artists are furious,"CNN Business —

Jason M. Allen was almost too nervous to enter his first art competition. Now his award-winning image is sparking controversy about whether art can be generated by a computer and what exactly it means to be an artist.

In August Allen a game designer who lives in Pueblo West Colorado won first place in the emerging artist division’s “digital arts/digitally-manipulated photography” category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition. His winning image titled “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial” (French for “Space Opera Theater”) was made with Midjourney — an artificial intelligence system that can produce detailed images when fed written prompts. A $300 prize accompanied his win.

“I’m fascinated by this imagery. I love it. And it think everyone should see it” Allen 39 told CNN Business in an interview on Friday.

Allen’s winning image looks like a bright surreal cross between a Renaissance and steampunk painting. It’s one of three such images he entered in the competition. In total 11 people entered 18 pieces of art in the same category in the emerging artist division.

The definition for the category in which Allen competed states that digital art refers to works that use “digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process.” Allen stated that Midjourney was used to create his image when he entered the contest he said.

Midjourney is one of a growing number of such AI image generators — others include Google Research’s Imagen and OpenAI’s DALL-E 2. Anyone can use Midjourney via Discord while DALL-E 2 requires an invitation and Imagen has not been opened up to users outside Google.

The newness of these tools how they’re used to produce images and in some cases the gatekeeping for access to some of the most powerful ones has led to debates about whether they can truly make art or assist humans in making art.

This came into sharp focus for Allen not long after his win. Allen had posted excitedly about his win on Midjourney’s Discord server on August 25 along with pictures of his three entries; it went viral on Twitter days later with many artists angered by Allen’s win because of his use of AI to create the image as a story by Vice’s Motherboard reported earlier this week.

“This sucks for the exact same reason we don’t let robots participate in the Olympics” one Twitter user wrote.

“This is the literal definition of ‘pressed a few buttons to make a digital art piece’” another Tweeted. “AI artwork is the ‘banana taped to the wall’ of the digital world now.”

Yet while Allen didn’t use a paintbrush to create his winning piece there was plenty of work involved he said.

“It’s not like you’re just smashing words together and winning competitions” he said.

You can feed a phrase like “an oil painting of an angry strawberry” to Midjourney and receive several images from the AI system within seconds but Allen’s process wasn’t that simple. To get the final three images he entered in the competition he said took more than 80 hours.

First he said he played around with phrasing that led Midjourney to generate images of women in frilly dresses and space helmets — he was trying to mash up Victorian-style costuming with space themes he said. Over time with many slight tweaks to his written prompt (such as to adjust lighting and color harmony) he created 900 iterations of what led to his final three images. He cleaned up those three images in Photoshop such as by giving one of the female figures in his winning image a head with wavy dark hair after Midjourney had rendered her headless. Then he ran the images through another software program called Gigapixel AI that can improve resolution and had the images printed on canvas at a local print shop.

Allen is glad the debate over whether AI can be used to make art is capturing so much attention.

“Rather than hating on the technology or the people behind it we need to recognize that it’s a powerful tool and use it for good so we can all move forward rather than sulking about it” Allen said.

Cal Duran an artist and art teacher who was one of the judges for the competition said that while Allen’s piece included a mention of Midjourney he didn’t realize that it was generated by AI when judging it.

Tommy Bahama beach chairs are everywhere,"New York CNN Business —

Heading to the beach this Labor Day weekend? Chances are you’ll see Tommy Bahama-branded chairs umbrellas and other gear spread out all over the sand.

This tropical kitsch brand which began in 1992 selling men’s silk Hawaiian shirts and then ventured into far-flung areas like furniture and restaurants is nearly everywhere by the ocean these days from Florida to California to New Jersey.

“Tommy Bahama is a lifestyle brand and the beach chair helps reinforce that idea of sun and vacation” said Edward Yruma a retail analyst at Piper Sandler who covers the brand’s owner Oxford Industries (OXM). “You see them all over most major coastal beaches during the summertime.”

The brand conquered America’s beaches thanks to a licensing strategy with a key outdoor goods’ manufacturer access to Costco’s 60 million plus members and new features on the chairs since their 2009 debut like backpack straps and extra pockets to hold sunscreen and smartphones.

Tommy Bahama sales are also getting a lift from “the return to leisure and vacation travel and permanent migration of so many people to warmer climates” during the pandemic Oxford Industries Thomas Chubb said on an earnings call Thursday.

Tommy Bahama doesn’t make its chairs and beach goods. They are made by ShelterLogic Group a leading outdoor and beach products’ manufacturer which also makes the RIO Beach brand of chairs and other sheds tents and camping equipment lines.

Instead Tommy Bahama licenses its name and design for the beach goods and receives royalties from sales at retailers. This licensing strategy means Tommy Bahama can increase customers’ exposure to the brand without incurring production or advertising costs.

The beach chairs themselves are an “incredibly powerful marketing tool” Yruma said.

‘Better to be lucky than good’

There is no public market share data on beach chairs but Rob Silinski the president of ShelterLogic Group estimates that Tommy Bahama controls 80% of the market for chairs above $30.

It’s an unexpected success story for Tommy Bahama.

The man who oversaw the chairs’ launch in 2009 almost two decades after the company started never imagined customers would buy them.

“It’s better to be lucky than good” said Doug Wood the president of the brand at the time and now CEO. “I had no illusion it would take off like this.”

At the time Tommy Bahama was struggling.

Its founders positioned the brand as a fashion line for men who belonged to country clubs. They were “Ralph Lauren aficionados” Bob Emfield one of the founders said of the brand’s target customer in a podcast this year.

They were looking to create a design that evoked the “Sunbelt and dressing down” Emfield said and were set on using the name of an island close to the mainland United States.

“Hawaii had been beat to death” he said. So they came up with “‘Tommy Bahama’ because I liked the resonation of the two words together.”

The founders had recently left the company and the country was suffering through the Great Recession which dragged down Tommy Bahama sales.

“We were a silk-based company known mostly for flowery camp shirts for men” CEO Wood said. “We had some swimwear in the line. No one thought about us as a beach brand. We were dressier than that.”

So when a Tommy Bahama executive pitched Wood the idea to work with ShelterLogic to sell licensed chairs at Costco Wood never thought it would work.

But the brand needed cash and Costco was guaranteeing around $250000 right away so Wood reluctantly agreed. “It took off” he said. “It continues to sell at an incredible rate.”

After its success at Costco Tommy Bahama expanded distribution to other chains such as Amazon and Walmart. Now Tommy Bahama releases a new chair every season and sends an email blast to subscribers when it debuts.

Richard Galanti the chief financial officer at Costco (COST) said “we sell crazy numbers” of the Tommy Bahama chairs at stores. “It’s a year-round product.”

The brand doesn’t break out sales from the business but Tommy Bahama sells up to two million chairs a year and 700000 umbrellas Wood said.

Its most popular product is the $89 “Wavy Marlin Deluxe” reclining navy blue aluminum chair with a built-in cooler padded backpack straps and a neck rest. Costco Amazon and other chains sell more basic versions for around $40.

In recent years ShelterLogic has expanded the Tommy Bahama line into kids’ chairs and ones higher off the ground designed for older people to more easily get out of the seats.

As a result of the chairs’ popularity Tommy Bahama developed an entirely new business around beach gear and more recently has moved into women’s swimwear coolers and t-shirts.

“It has allowed us to build businesses that we didn’t have” Wood said.

On Friday Dr. Jazz Atwal announced that some Manitobans — including anyone 65 and older and Indigenous people 18 and older — will be among the first in the province eligible for an updated vaccine from Moderna that targets both the original strain of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and its Omicron variant.

When asked to describe the current spread of COVID-19 in the community Atwal said the focus should be on severe outcomes from the illness rather than the number of active infections.

He drew a comparison to common colds to make his point.

""Before COVID … colds went around. Most people did well. Some people still ended up in hospital back then. That was a severe outcome"" he said at a Friday news conference.

""There's such a focus on infection right now occurring but it's OK to get infected"" said Atwal. ""You're building your natural immunity so that's good.""

Dr. Jazz Atwal deputy chief provincial public health officer announced the initial eligibility for the new bivalent vaccine from Moderna on Friday. He also cautioned against focusing too much on the number of COVID-19 infections in the province saying 'it's OK to get infected.' (Jeff Stapleton/CBC)

Manitoba is not seeing the level of severe outcomes from COVID-19 cases caused by the Omicron variant compared to earlier variants according to Atwal — in part because vaccine uptake in the province has been good.

Focusing on how many people have an active infection in Manitoba rather than severe outcomes ""does not help the situation at all"" he said.

But Dr. Jillian Horton a hospital-based specialist in internal medicine in Winnipeg says there's a risk that comes when health leaders minimize COVID-19 infections.

""The problem I have with framing it that way is it doesn't really give people the full picture"" she said in an interview with CBC News on Saturday.

The province has encouraged COVID-19 vaccination she notes and ""certainly reassurance where appropriate is an important part of communicating with the public.""

But she said ""the bigger picture is it would be much better if you hadn't gotten that infection in the first place.""

A Winnipeg epidemiologist said while getting infected with COVID-19 could bring some immunity it's still best to avoid getting infected at all.

Responding in an interview Friday to the province's recommendation that people wait to get booster shots until the bivalent vaccine becomes available Cynthia Carr the founder of EPI Research in Winnipeg noted that ""the vast majority of us have probably been infected with Omicron at the very least"" which leads to some level of immunity.

""That is not at all a recommendation to become infected — but it is a fact particularly if you've had … at least two or three vaccines with that you have hybrid immunity"" she said.

'Infections do matter': Stanford researcher

Horton said she takes some hope from a well-vaccinated population in Manitoba and more vaccine developments likely on the horizon.

But infections are certain to increase once kids head back to class she said and indoor masking and improving the quality of indoor air should continue to be a top priority heading into the fall.

She fears Atwal's comment may minimize the risk of COVID-19 infection which is not ""helpful to people as they try to navigate what personal decisions are right for them especially knowing that we have really abandoned broad-scale public health strategies to try to mitigate the spread of COVID.""

The comments could have a negative effect on people's behaviour she said.

""So then you have people who previously were concerned … maybe they walk away from that and say 'Well why would I upgrade my ventilation at my own personal expense at my business or my place of work if it's fine? Why would my kid keep masking indoors if it's fine?'""

Dr. Abraar Karan an infectious disease doctor and medical researcher at Stanford University also took issue with Atwal's comments in an exchange with Horton on Twitter.

Infections do matter. Full costs of repeat infections unclear but sig morbidity risk for vulnerable hosts is there; best to have humility re unknowns esp in public comms. Comparisons to common colds also not too helpful. Investing in public infrastructure for clean air is key —@AbraarKaran

""Infections do matter"" he tweeted in a reply to Horton.

There are still significant risks from the illness for vulnerable people according to Karan and it is ""best to have humility"" regarding the unknowns surrounding COVID-19 especially in public communications.

From Academy Award-Winning executive producers E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin the Edge of the Unknown with Jimmy Chin is set to premier on Monday September 5 on National Geographic. The 10-part documentary series takes viewers behind the scenes and into the minds of pioneering adventure athletes as they recount pivotal moments in their lives that led to the mastery of their craft.

Among the featured athletes is legendary big wave surfer Justine Dupont. The French surfer was on a mission to defy gender stereotypes and push the sport forward for female athletes until a massive wipeout at Jaws set her back. Her episode “Eaten by Jaws” details the wipeout and how the major setback ultimately set her up for success in her sport.

Dupont’s episode will be available to stream on Disney+ (along with all other episodes in the series) on Sept. 7 and will make its broadcast debut on National Geographic on Tuesday Sept. 20.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDVkYy5jb20vbmV3cy9ibGFjay1sLXUtdi1mZXN0aXZhbC1yZXR1cm5zLXRvLWZvcnQtZHVwb250LXBhcmstZm9yLTI1dGgtYW5uaW52ZXJzYXJ50gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94NWRjLmNvbS9uZXdzL2JsYWNrLWwtdS12LWZlc3RpdmFsLXJldHVybnMtdG8tZm9ydC1kdXBvbnQtcGFyay1mb3ItMjV0aC1hbm5pbnZlcnNhcnkuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Black L.U.V.

That’s the argument made by Swift Hesperange a club currently topping the Luxembourg domestic league while trying to find a way to stop playing in it.

Swift Hesperange have lodged a case arguing that they should be allowed play in a cross-border Benelux League and asked a court in Luxembourg to refer the case to the European Court of Justice.

Swift argue Uefa’s insistence that the club plays in Luxembourg and not elsewhere is condemning them to remain a “micro-enterprise” which thus deprives the people of Luxembourg the right to watch elite-level European football in the flesh.

Their issue is with Uefa’s territorial model in which competitions are arranged according to 55 national territories. This they argue has served only the biggest countries and left Dublin among a number of European cities deprived of elite competition.

“A quick overview of the European territory shows that the ‘Uefa territorial model’ structurally deprives some 20 (out of 27) [EU] member states of premium club football” they argue in a press release accompanying their legal arguments and further illustrate their argument by listing Dublin among the cities “whose flagship club has no real chance of participating” in the Champions League.

(They didn’t name Dublin’s flagship club – that feels like an argument to be made below the line.)

Victory for Swift could be transformative for clubs across Europe including in Ireland as it would open up the prospect of cross-border domestic leagues proposals for which have arisen more than once in Ireland in recent years.

Among Swift’s team of lawyers is Jean-Louis Dupont who is already partly responsible for transforming football. Dupont was part of the legal team that won the Bosman ruling at the European Court of Justice in 1995 which applied the EU principle of freedom of movement to football players.

In practical terms it meant players could leave their current club for another at the end of their contract for free and it led to the game’s wealth and power being tilted in favour of players to an unprecedented extent.

Dupont is also involved in a second case in Luxembourg albeit one that has already been referred to European Court of Justice. The arguments have been heard too and the court will rule on 15 December on the side of Uefa or the party represented by Dupont and his colleagues: the European Super League.

We’ll explain both arguments in more depth in a moment but think of both cases as a kind of Bosman ruling for football clubs rather than football players.

Let’s start with Swift Hesperange case.

The club argues that football underwent an overnight revolution with the Bosman ruling and that football’s governing bodies didn’t move with the times. Whereas the players could now move freely the clubs couldn’t move with them and thus couldn’t expand their market base to appeal to the top players who now had the right to hold out for the best price.

“Suddenly the best young Belgian player was no longer forced to sign for one of the two or three main Belgian clubs: he was free to sign for Bayern or Juventus which he certainly did” argue Swift in the aforementioned release. “Uefa did not take decisions to adjust the production market to the new realities of the labour market. On the contrary they have kept all the clubs in the ‘small’ states in their national straitjackets…to the detriment of all their fans (consumers.)”

Hence they argue why these clubs from smaller countries won’t ever make the Champions League: how can they compete with the bigger countries if they can’t play outside the limits of their national borders?

“Under the current system clubs are actually the losers particularly from smaller countries” says Dupont in email correspondence with The42. “Many traditional clubs are effectively impeded from developing and growing under Uefa’s current territorial model and thus also from ever taking part in the Champions League. The funding system firmly designed along national borders and corresponding media revenues is the key problem. Contrary to what Uefa claims financial solidarity is weak as the vast majority of Uefa’s payments go mainly to medium-sized professional clubs from the big leagues.

“We need a merit-based format that fosters the development of larger clubs from all important cities regardless of the size of the home EU member state promoting the growth of football within the EU. This is where cities such as Dublin should see a major opportunity.”

But surely cultural and historical factors unique to Ireland – such as the competition provided by the GAA the proximity of the Premier League and the historical dysfunction of the FAI – are more relevant to the failure of a League of Ireland club to play in the Champions League?

“Historical and cultural factors have played a role in how we got to the current situation” replies Dupont “but that doesn’t mean we have to just accept it forever. While the GAA has a special place in Irish society it does not render Ireland unique among smaller EU member states. Uefa’s system is weak and again some 20 member states are deprived of premium club football. Ireland is no exception.

“Ireland is not alone in having its best players taken early by a neighbouring football superpower or having them choose another sport. One can substitute GAA for basketball or handball in other European countries. The youth academies of all large clubs are full of players poached from smaller leagues.”

The reason Dupont cites “member states” so often is the fact Swift’s argument is rooted in EU law. A principle of the EU’s freedom of movement for people and for capital is that the prosperity of a member country shouldn’t be defined by the size of their territory and so Swift Hesperange argue that Uefa are infringing the EU’s competition law by preventing clubs creating a “transnational competition that would allow all the clubs involved to develop and offer their fans the consumers a better quality of entertainment (product.)”

The reason fans are referred to as consumers and the football referred to as product is that the case to be made here is that football should be treated as any other business would under competition law.

To return to Swift’s argument in their press release they hypothetically cite a Benelux League or a North Sea League which would “then have the critical mass to guarantee a regional league whose quality could match that of for example the French Ligue 1.”

Irish clubs were engaged on the prospect of a cross-border all-island league in 2019 owing to a proposal developed a group led by entrepreneur Kieran Lucid. It was looked upon favourably by many but one of its issues was the fact it would mean a reduction in the number of places in Uefa competitions on offer.

The Dutch consultancy company Hypercube were brought on board with coming up with a compromise and their complex solution – split seasons coming together at the end for a ‘king of the island’ competition – didn’t engender mass support.

Uefa competitions are where the real money is in Irish football. The total prize fund in the League of Ireland this season is €600000 whereas Shamrock Rovers have guaranteed themselves more than €3 million by qualifying for the group stage of the Conference League. To further illustrate that divide Rovers will bank €500000 for every game they win in the group.

“Today clubs are caught in a vicious cycle” says Dupont. “While they are dependent on the revenue generated by Uefa’s system this system is simultaneously preventing their development and is curbing their investment opportunities. Clubs are trapped in a system that has no ambition for reform and threatens sanctions on every club that is trying to actively shape their own development.”

That last line takes us to the second case that of the European Super League. While nine of the 12 clubs quickly slunk ashen-faced and red-handed away from the proposals of last year Real Madrid Barcelona and Juventus have remained on board. All of the Super League backers were threatened with sanctions: Uefa said they would kick them out of the Champions League while Fifa threatened that Super League players would not be allowed to play at the World Cup.

The remaining three clubs went to court to argue that Uefa and Fifa had violated EU competition law in threatening these sanctions and preventing the formation of their competition. A Madrid court referred the decision to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg and the judgement will be handed down on 15 December.

The ESL clubs are also citing EU competition law which exists to combat the creation of cartels or monopolies that would be damaging to the consumer or in the case of football the fan.

The clubs have argued that Uefa breached these EU competition laws and acted as a monopoly in sanctioning the clubs for signing up to the Super League claiming they did so as they wanted to protect their cash-cow the Champions League. They also argue that Uefa have an inherent conflict of interest in arranging and regulating competitions from which they profit.

Uefa countered by saying they are following the EU’s constitution in acting to prevent the Super League. Their argument rests on Article 165 of the Lisbon Treaty which enshrines a “specific nature” for sport and requires EU member states to “promote a fairness and openness in sporting competition.”

Uefa have previously published a document outlining their stance on the Treaty Article they cited in court stating their belief that sport is “not above the law” but cannot be treated as “another business.” The ESL Clubs and Swift Hesperange argue that when it comes to the EU’s laws underpinning free movement and competition football should be treated as another business.

Uefa also say that sport’s “specific” values are expressed by the European Sports Model which they define as being “characterised by a democratic territorial and pyramid-shaped structure.” This pyramid Uefa argued is essential to the funding of grassroots football across Europe as money trickles down to a broad base from the Champions League at the narrow peak.

In court Dupont dismissed Uefa’s pyramid structure. “The Egyptians built magnificent pyramids but Uefa’s wouldn’t win any architectural prizes” he said pointing like Swift Hesperange to the fact clubs in small national markets can’t escape them.

Uefa argued that a closed-shop Super League with no promotion and relegation – was was the plan last year – isn’t exactly a bastion of “openness.” And while that may be a strong argument the ESL clubs aren’t in court for the judges to give their 12-team structure a thumbs-up. The ruling won’t instantly decide on the format of a competition but merely the rights of the clubs to set up a new competition.

The ESL clubs also argued their competition could distribute more funds to lower-level of the game saying they could exceed Uefa’s £250 million by at least £100 million and would be overseen by an independent body they did not specify.

Nobody knows what the result will be and won’t until the judgement is published in mid-December. The ruling will either kill the Super League and any other clubs’ hopes of breaking away from Uefa’s continental competitions or else breathe new life into those ambitions.

The Swift Hesperange case meanwhile may give clubs the opportunity to break away from their own domestic leagues.

Shamrock Rovers meanwhile kick off their Europa Conference League campaign against Djurgardens at Tallaght Stadium next Thursday. They like all other clubs in Uefa’s trio of men’s club competitions will kick off beneath an incongruous shadow cast from Luxembourg.",,,

Eaton is already home to a growing community of people of retirement age.

McCarthy Stone already offers accommodation in Coralie Court and Daisy Hill Court - phase one - and work is under way to bring phase two - Strawberry Hill Gardens - to life by the summer of 2023.

The developer of retirement communities proposed plans for the third phase in Bluebell Road in August which would bring a further 100 homes to the village.

But who better to tell you why Eaton is a fantastic place to retire to than those in the heart of the community?

Welcoming the news of more retirement housing is Laura Wilson 53 who owns the Red Lion pub in the centre of the village with her husband Paul.

""They've got a supermarket within walking distance and a post office. There are really good bus routes dry cleaners - they've got everything you'd want. And two great pubs"" said Mrs Wilson.

""We have lovely walks being so close to the city.

""It's the best of both worlds here. A village feel but being within really close proximity to Norwich.""

During lockdown the Red Lion team delivered fish and chips and Sunday roasts to Eaton's more mature population - something they continue to offer today.

Laura added: ""We've always had a more mature clientele as people love to come to us for lunch.

""We see a lot of regulars.

""To someone considering moving to Eaton do. It's a lovely community.

""There's also a great choir and two churches. It's absolutely perfect.

""I love working in this community. We're looking forward to some more properties being built.""

The visiting vicar at one of Eaton's churches - St Andrews - is Andrea Woods who has lived in Eaton for 24 years.

""There is definitely a much older population within the church"" she explained.

""People are ageing - and people tend to come to Eaton and stay.

""You've got everything nearby that you could need.

""You're not far from cosmopolitan theatres and cinemas and all of that - I'd recommend this area absolutely.

""It's a great community here.""

Jacob Seaman manager at Hammond and Stratford Estate Agents' Eaton branch explained why the suburb is great for those of retirement age.

""Eaton has a close-knit community supported by local businesses in the heart of the village"" he said.

""There’s a hairdressers post office dry cleaner charity shop and two family-friendly pubs.

""If you venture slightly away from the main high-street there’s also a golf course large supermarket and churches.

""Nearby bus routes and road links connect Eaton to Norwich city centre and the A11/A47 interchange making it easier to get out and about and enjoy later-life.

""For those who enjoy exploring the great outdoors there are recreational areas such as Marston Marshes and Eaton Park which are great for family days out and dog walking

""Eaton appeals to all age groups - it’s considered an aspirational place to live for many appealing to both young professionals and growing families alike.

""Eaton and the neighbouring village of Cringleford have both seen significant investment over the last 15 years.

""Eaton offers the best of both worlds - a bustling hub of activity at its centre with a calmer and more relaxed feel as you step away from the high street into the suburbs.

""It’s considered an affluent area with a diverse selection of properties available ranging from contemporary new builds to traditional characterful homes.

""This coupled with easy access into Norwich and to major road links make it a real gem

""It’s surrounded by some breath-taking Norfolk countryside scenery meaning there really is something for everyone.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ib3N0b25nbG9iZS9uYW1lL2NhbWVyb24tYmVlcnMtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzY0MTAyMjnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cameron Beers Obituary (2022) - Needham MA - Boston Globe,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/bostonglobe/name/cameron-beers-obituary?id=36410229 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ib3N0b25nbG9iZS9uYW1lL2NhbWVyb24tYmVlcnMtb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9MzY0MTAyMjnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

You could buy around 2400 different consoles on eBay right now,"If you have a spare cool mill laying around somewhere and fancy upping your console collection there's an eBay listing you might want to check out.

With the world of video games offering a fair number of rare collectibles due to limited prints of cartridges or certain consoles and peripherals not doing well enough to warrant much production of them there's a lot of collectors in turn who like to build personal libraries. And recently an eBay listing (spotted by Consolevariations.com) shows a pretty impressive collection of roughly 2400 different consoles. And all the seller wants for it is €984000 which is about a million US dollars or £850000.

The auction looks legitimately impressive. Images show a Japanese and (presumably) European version of the Pokemon themed N64 a deliciously burnt orange GameCube a PSP Go and so much more. Seriuosly it is a ridiculuosly large collection that honestly could be worth the asking price. The user in question kariaure has even shared videos of their collection on their YouTube channel with an extensive range of Sega consoles Game Boys and more shown off.

One video even shows their collection from 2010 around 12 years ago where they only had 1500 consoles which means they've wracked up a further thousand different consoles in the meantime.

Based on a Google translation the seller has been collecting since the early 90s noting that at the time collecting wasn't as much of a thing compared to what it's like now. Kariaure notes in the listing that they are open to a purchase from a collector but also a museum should one be interested. Which might fit in nicely with the intitiative Embracer Group has set up.

Obviously most of us aren't going to be able to afford this collection and likely won't even have the space. But it's fun to daydream sometimes isn't it?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5c3Rhci5jby51ay9uZXdzL3dvcmxkLW5ld3MvY29ycnVwdC1wdXRpbi1zb2xkaWVycy1mbG9nLWFybXktMjc5MDQ2MjnSAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseXN0YXIuY28udWsvbmV3cy93b3JsZC1uZXdzL2NvcnJ1cHQtcHV0aW4tc29sZGllcnMtZmxvZy1hcm15LTI3OTA0NjI5LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Corrupt Putin soldiers flog army gear and vehicles on Russian eBay as war effort falters,"Something went wrong please try again later.

Generals in Vladimir Putin's army have been hocking military gear and equipment on Russia's eBay while poorly kitted out troops are sent to fight on the frontline of the blunder-filled invasion of Ukraine.

Online marketplace Avito - Russia's answer to eBay - has been flooded with body armour weaponry parts and bullet-proof vehicles estimated to be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds.

The Sun revealed that a Gaz 2330 Tiger infantry vehicle which comes with armour plates spall liners and bulletproof glass windows and which has been used by the Russian army since 2006 was up for grabs on Avito for £250000.

The ad claims the vehicle was the 2011 model with a mileage of 17400 miles.

The ad stated ""The ad is real. Please do not distract call and write only on business."" It was posted near a military base outside of Moscow.

A second advert was selling a truck that boasts windows and doors with ""ballistic resistance"" for about £2250000. The 2005 model is said to provide ""protection for the crew from secondary armour fragments when armour-piercing bullets shell fragments and mines hit the hull"". It also comes with a khaki interior.

Standard Russian military armour is on sale for £85 while a full vest with helmet is on the market for £250 and a pair of granite bulletproof plates are on sale for £125.

Radios water filters bulletproof coverings and high-grade special ops helmets are also up for sale.

This equipment should be going to the soldiers battling on in Ukraine but instead is going towards lining the pockets of corrupt military personnel.

Weapons expert Sam Cranny-Evans told The Sun that flogging military goods is a common practice for Russian army officers who supplement their meager salaries by selling ""whatever they've got"" online and keeping the cash while handing out old gear to conscripts.

He said: ""What happens is that senior soldiers sell that uniform on Avito and keep the proceeds and hand down [uniforms] from the previous year.

(Image: Avito)

""Now imagine that happening with body armour. Eventually you end up in a very bad situation where the body armour they [the conscripts] do have available is rotten destroyed or just not there.""

This news follows six months of war in Ukraine which has been marked by many failures on the Russian side which includes the loss of top personnel poor military planning and the sinking of warship Moskva the pride of the Black Sea Fleet.

Joseph McCreath 19 loves a car boot sale and has created an impressive profitable business from his love of bargains.

The student makes a generous amount of extra cash to help alongside his part-time restaurant job by going to car boot sales every weekend and flipping clothing he finds online.

The teenager started this journey back in May this year. His lucrative thrift-and-flip business all started when he bought two football shirts from a charity shop for £8 and was able to sell them on ebay for £90 pocketing himself a nice £82.

Joseph who studies business management and entrepreneurship at Nottingham Trent University said: ‘I sold one for £25 and one for £65 and I thought why can’t I do this on a larger scale?

‘I liked the idea of going to car boot sales where you can buy stuff for really cheap.’

Four months down the line he regularly hunts down bargain items for a couple of pounds and sells them on through eBay Depop and Vinted.

‘The first month [of the business] was a write-off’ he said. ‘As I built up my stock and social media following and positive reviews which really impact the success of online selling.’

Now he’s bringing in a whole other income through selling clothes on.

‘I sell clothes on Depop eBay and Vinted but I am struggling with cross-listing which is really time consuming so I’m trying to figure out the best platform to sell it on – I think Depop is the best one to scale a business on.’

Sometimes Joseph tries scouring for bargains in charity shops too but finds car boots are the best.

‘[Charity shops are] just a little bit more expensive with the rise of popularity of vintage clothing’ he noted.

With people across the UK struggling in the cost of living crisis Joseph thinks this could be a simple fun way for others to bring in cash just like he is.

Plus a car boot visit is a cheap activity to do on the weekends.

The teenager said: ‘Clothes at a car boot sale aren’t displayed nice they’re all piled up but if I dig through it all I can find these gems take them back iron them display them nice photograph them and sell them on for a bit more.’

He says how much money you can make from thrifting and flipping is a bit up and down though.

‘How much money you can make depends on if you find a big item or not’ he explained. ‘In one day I reckon I turn £50 at a car boot sale into about £300 to £400 profit.’

His best car boot find yet? A vintage 80s AVIREX leather jacket which he bought for just £5. He then sold this online for £160 bringing in a huge £155 profit.

For Joseph flipping car boot sale finds felt like a natural step because of his lifelong passion for clothing.

To up his chances of cashing in he searches for designer brands hidden in piles of clothes at car boot sales and keeps on top of what items are trending on Depop so he can search for similar clothes.

‘I look for branded stuff mainly so Nike Adidas and designer stuff but also the material’ he said. ‘Trending products now are linen trousers cargo trousers denim mini skirts.

‘It’s not only the branded stuff it’s the material too and what style is trending.’

He also does a lot of research for what trends are coming up next so he can search in advance.

‘I’m in a Discord group which discusses trending products what is selling what isn’t and I look at what searches are trending on Depop’ he explained.

He’s hoping to scale up the business (Picture: Joe McCreath / SWNS)

‘Hoodies for autumn are the most searched item at the moment so next time I go to a car boot sale I’ll be looking for hoodies.’

Business has surged for the student and his vintage shop Joe’s Vintage Threads has sold over 100 items on Depop since May 2022 and holds a five star rating.

He’s currently selling the clothes out of his family home in Coventry and said: ‘My friends and family like what I do – although my mum isn’t best pleased with all the clothes in the front room with boxes all over the place! But they like the desire I have and the vision I’ve got.’

With business going well Joe is keen to continue growing his shop while completing his degree and loves seeing people become more sustainable with their purchases.

‘I’m really enjoying it at the minute’ he added. ‘If I can carry on that mindset of enjoying it it doesn’t really feel like a job – it doesn’t feel like going to a car boot sale at 5AM is work.

‘I really want to get hold of a supplier like a wholesaler who can sell me bales of clothes that I can search through rather than going to car boot sales.

‘I reckon I do have the potential to scale it even further.

‘It’s just finding the time and getting a website together.

‘I know people who have scaled doing this kind of thing to six figures so there’s no reason why I can’t do it too if I really want it.’

‘I’m really excited to see what happens in the future.”

Joe says he has always been passionate about buying secondhand clothing and thinks everyone should try it.

‘Someone who hasn’t bought second hand before might think the clothes are dirty someone else has worn them but there’s this whole thing about sustainability which I like’ he said.

‘Buying second hand means that one piece of clothing won’t go to the ocean.’

He reckons that by 2025 vintage clothing ‘will be more popular than single use clothing’ and the high street.

He wants others to join in and start thrifting to make extra cash especially while basic expenses and cost of living prices keep hiking.

‘I like showing tips to people on how easy it is and how they can do it too’ he added.

‘Not everyone works on a Sunday so [if you do have it off] visiting car boot sales and selling on your finds is a great way to make some extra money on the weekend with everyone struggling in the cost of living crisis.’

The rare coin has turned up on eBay and is valuable because of an error most would miss.

This particular 50p piece was brought out to mark the 1918 Representation of the People Act in 2018. However because of a slight error in one of the Ns it became tremendously valuable - and there are more out there.

The coin is not particularly rare and around 9million were made. The 50p was minted to celebrate a law which gave the vote to women over the age of 30 - provided they owned property - and the particularly rare ones come with the minting error.

In particular the first N blends into the T next to it. This has been enough for the coins to change hands for five figures before.

They aren't the only valuable 50p pieces either. The 2019 Paddington Bear Tower of London coin has also gone for £10000 on eBay before.

A 2020 Brexit 50p has also sold for £9999. The coins marking leaving the European Union have the slogan 'Peace Prosperity and Freedom with All Nations' on them.

The Kew Gardens 50ps are also valuable. The Royal Mint estimates around 210000 were made and it features the famous pagoda on the tails side with the Queen's face as normal on the other.

Change-checking website Coin Hunter puts the average resale price for the Kew Gardens 50p between £150.89 and £161.50.

The announcement comes roughly eight months after LG Electronics said at its press conference that it plans to incorporate NFT features into its smart TV. The platform is now available in the U.S. only to those with LG TV running webOS 5.0 or later and is accessible directly from the home screen.

LG Electronics partnered with the Hedera network to offer an app that enables users to purchase NFTs via Wallypto LG’s crypto wallet for smartphones.

“Wallypto built on Hedera has been developing since September 2021” Chris Jo senior vice president head of platform business at LG Electronics home entertainment company told TechCrunch. “Its beta version of the wallet launched this week in August.”

The partnership between Hedera and LG Electronics was initiated in 2020 when LG joined the Hedera governing council that includes Google IBM Deutsche Telekom and the Indian Institute of Technology and more.

“While many people have heard of NFTs and would like to participate in the growing ecosystem it can be overly complex and difficult to get started” Jo said. “LG Art Lab is designed to allow millions of users in the U.S. to easily access and display NFTs without having to interact with code or directly with a blockchain themselves.”

The NFT platform provides a Drops feature that profiles artists and shows their new artwork previews. Its real-time Live Drops feature gives notifications to help users acquire a dropped NFT to ensure they do not miss an opportunity.

Jo also said that Hedera allows users to transact for less than $0.0001 cent per transaction (with no high gas fee or hidden costs) meaning that there are no hidden costs associated with the NFT platform.

“The Hedera Network consumes vastly less energy than any other public ledger making it the ideal choice for sustainable initiatives and meaning that it can meet the ESG of modern businesses and investors” Jo explained. Users can buy sell and display NFTs on the Hedera network without worrying about the high energy consumption associated with other public networks he said adding that Hedera guarantees a low predictable fee for users unlike many other decentralized networks.

South Korea’s IT and entertainment companies are jumping into the non-fungible token (NFT) industry. In January LG’s rival Samsung unveiled its new smart TV-based NFT marketplace plan. Samsung said it will add NFT features on Samsung TVs like MICRO LED and Neo QLED.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9lc3BvcnRzL25ld3MtZWEtYmFubmluZy1wbGF5ZXJzLW5hbWluZy1jaGFyYWN0ZXItYW5kcmV3LXRhdGUtYXBleC1sZWdlbmRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EA is banning players for naming their character Andrew Tate in Apex Legends,"EA is reportedly banning players for naming themselves ""Andrew Tate"" in Apex Legends with a number of accounts already getting suspended. On September 2 2022 a Reddit user claimed that he was banned from the Battle Royale for naming his character after the British-American influencer.

As per the message received from Electronic Arts the name breaks their Positive Play Character policy and negatively disrupts the game. However it appears that other players with the same username have also received a week-long ban.

Apex Legends players were reportedly banned for using Andrew Tate as their in-game name

Rumble's newest star Andrew Tate may have been banned from all major social media platforms but the internet doesn't seem to be over him. Dubbed the King of Toxic Masculinity the former Kickboxer has come under scrutiny for his controversial takes on numerous sensitive topics.

However it seems like Tate has been de-platformed from Apex Legends as well with the title cracking down on references to the controversial online personality. Apparently using his name in the game appears to be a breach of their policies.

Reddit user u/Jayjayhova claimed that he has been banned from the game on charges of using ""Andrew Tate"" as his in-game moniker. The message from Electronic Arts states that the name apparently breaks their Positive Play Character policy and even if intended as a mere joke it still disrupts the game for other players. Notably the offense comes under the hateful conduct category of policy infringement.

Although nothing has been officially disclosed yet players do appear to be getting a week-long ban from Apex Legends for this reason.

Social media reacts to the entire incident

As expected the Reddit post has gained immense traction and is already making rounds on the internet. Judging by the comments the majority of viewers shared their own experiences of receiving similar emails from Electronic Arts regarding the use of Andrew Tate as their in-game name.

Here's what fans had to say:

At the time of writing neither Electronic Arts nor Tate have published any official statement regarding the new policy. While players did raise some queries about the phenomenon none have yet been answered."

A colleague just finishing a stint in the London office of American Express asked if she would like to apply for a job as part of the head office marketing team in the Big Apple.

Jumping from a small pond into a big incredibly competitive lake like the head office of a global giant was both exhilarating and intimidating and it had all the elements of a swim or sink proposition.

Yet Melanie gave her colleague her answer in just a fraction more than a New York minute. “My colleague said she’d like to have me as part of her team” recalls Melanie now the CEO and Group Managing Director of leading data analytics and technology firm Equifax Australia. “I went home and said to my husband: ‘What do you reckon? Do you fancy giving it a shot and living in New York? He said ‘Yeah sure. Let’s go!”

Melanie Cochrane never thought of herself as a risk taker. Yet when Melanie looks back at a stellar business career that spans the past three decades with leadership positions in some of the world’s largest and most innovative global companies she now recognises that taking risks is fundamental to the person she is today.

“I never categorised myself as a risk taker” says Melanie who was born in Leicester in the UK and graduated in business studies and marketing from Brighton University. “But I love innovation and I love encouraging the people I work with to take risks. Now I look back and I see that what I have done is risk taking. And all those conversations started with me saying ‘Yes’ and then asking myself ‘What is the worst that can happen?’

“I have had so many times when I have endured self-doubt or imposter syndrome or any of those phrases that people like to use” says Melanie.

“I remember arriving in New York and getting the escalator up to the head office on my first day at Amex and being absolutely terrified. I can’t tell you how many times I have said to myself ‘What have I just talked myself into?’”

Not that Melanie needed to worry. Combining dedication and drive with a love of innovation and an uncanny talent for team building Melanie fitted right into the highly competitive business culture at Amex where she found experience reward and increasing responsibility in a variety of leadership roles.

From marketing Melanie moved to work in the business-to-business (B2B) side of American Express. “I did more business development and strategy than traditional marketing” she recalls.

What followed was an entrée to a globe-trotting series of jobs leading business teams across the world. She had a six-year appointment based in Australia and took out Australian citizenship while looking after AMEX business clients in Sydney New Zealand Singapore Hong Kong Japan and India before being approached by head office to run teams working with mid-size businesses across the US out of the office in Phoenix Arizona.

“Moving to Phoenix I thought I would love the job but hate living there because of the heat” she recalls. “And yes it was damned hot but I loved everything about it. I could go hiking in the Grand Canyon and live in this incredible desert. It was beautiful.

“I had no idea that running in the desert and jumping over rattle snakes and avoiding coyotes was going to be a part of my life.”

As beautiful and beguiling as the desert was it was nothing compared to the excitement of Melanie’s next move. AMEX asked her to lead its Global Digital Servicing Transformation Program a cornerstone strategy to establish AMEX as a Digital leader in the technological age.

“That was something completely outside of my comfort zone” says Melanie. “I didn’t have a strong technical background. I had about eight bosses and I wasn’t really sure what everybody wanted.”

The job was an enormous effort of collaboration and coordination of pulling together an ambitious global strategy and then executing it. “I clearly remember sitting down with my brand new team and saying ‘OK where do we start?’

It was viscerally exciting. “I had such talented people working for me” says Melanie. “The world was changing and changing fast and we had to change with it.”

The transformation and its success gave AMEX the ability to evolve quickly and seize opportunities in that rapidly changing world.

But by then Melanie was already on a plane back to Australia to become Regional Senior Vice President and General Manager of Corporate Payments and then later Merchant Services for AMEX in Japan Asia Pacific & Australia

After five years in “a dream job” a company restructure gave Melanie an opportunity to take a break. She planned to take a year off and travel but her plans coincided with the beginning of the global pandemic.

“I had a great chance to decide what I wanted to do next” she says. “I spent some time in the start-up community learning more about innovation and how corporates take outside innovation in. I really enjoyed being involved in digital transformation data and getting more involved in the fin-tech world and opening my eyes a little more to the opportunities available.”

Then about a year ago data analytics and technology company Equifax came knocking with an opportunity to lead the company a challenge that Melanie believes came at exactly the right time.

“I had decided that I was ready to run a business again” she says. “It was a little lonely working on my own as a consultant. The timing was perfect in hindsight because I had learned that the rate and pace of change in data analytics is simply incredible.

Even so her first year in the job has been a massive learning curve she says. “I am definitely not a data scientist and I am not a technician but I am fascinated by the things we are able to do for our customers. We have the bandwidth and the freedom from being part of a bigger organisation to really bring our business model to life here in Australia and New Zealand.”

Equifax Australia is also in the midst of a digital transformation redesigning its technology platform and transferring to the cloud to create a cloud native secure environment a massive operation that has vast potential for the company and the services it provides.

At its core Equifax began as a traditional credit bureau Melanie says but it has evolved into so much more that change is underpinned by data analytics.

“Once completed the company will have everything in data fabric in a data lake” says Melanie. “Traditionally data sets are siloed and are not dynamic. In the cloud we are able to take in so much more data and find unique ways to solve customer problems whether that is being able to identify fraud being able to identify a supply chain risk or rate a building construction project or even background screening for employees.”

Melanie points to the Building and Construction Project that Equifax has created in conjunction with the NSW Building Commissioner to mitigate risk in the construction and development sector.

“It’s a rating scorecard” Melanie explains. “There have been a lot of stories about defects in buildings lately. There are a lot of terrible stories about developers going bust and not being able to complete projects or leaving faulty buildings where people are left with sky rocketing strata fees and their personal life savings being impacted through major defects.

“There has been an agenda for reform in this area and we have been working on this project for the past couple of years to help create transparency around the construction industry whether that is for big business small business or just you or I.”

Away from the office she shares her life with her husband Andy and their dog Seven (he was the seventh of the litter) a German short-haired pointer. A hockey player in her youth Melanie also loves team sports. She has combined that love with a passion for horses and now plays polo in western Sydney on the weekends.

“I love animals and I love games with sticks and balls – polo has all of these and even though I play very badly I love it” she says.

Melanie believes in what she is doing just as much as she believes in the people around her.

“I am mature enough to know that I am not going to always be the smartest person in the room’ she says. “And we have some seriously smart people working with us. We have very deep conversations around data privacy AI and ethics.

And these conversations include the role that Equifax can play.

“I love the intellectual challenge and I love being able to let people have their wings. I want people to flourish and create an environment that people are proud to be a part of. Being surrounded by such great people and seeing what we can do for our customers is such a great experience.”

Melanie recognises that her role leading Equifax is a bit of a stretch for her “technical” skill set but that’s also something that has characterised her entire career.

“It’s the optimist in me” she says. “I’m an extremely optimistic person. Life is definitely a glass half full. I will always look for the silver lining and I think when taking risks or putting yourself outside your comfort zone – and coming to Equifax was definitely outside my comfort zone – you just have to take the attitude that you will find the way and that in the end I wasn’t hired for my technical expertise but for my leadership.

“What I am excited about is what the next few years will bring as we harness the amazing change that we are going through right now.

There are so many solutions we will be able to find for our customers and how that will create even broader impacts.

“Bringing trust and transparency into different ecosystems has huge potential so the timing couldn’t be better in terms of the amount of change and positive disruption from new technologies and the capabilities that come from that.

“I believe I will lead this business for many years to come and help us evolve and deliver in a way that even a few years ago we didn’t think possible. There is so much to offer and I am confident we will thrive at the next horizon.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vY2xhcmsuY29tL2NyZWRpdC9jcmVkaXQta2FybWEtdnMtY3JlZGl0LXNlc2FtZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Credit Karma vs. Credit Sesame: Is One Better Than the Other?,"Credit monitoring services such as Credit Karma and Credit Sesame enjoy widespread popularity these days but which one is better?

If you’re in debt and working to pull yourself out of it or if you’re concerned about identity theft choosing the best site to monitor your credit is an important part of your financial journey.

We’ve spent a lot of time with both Credit Karma and Credit Sesame. Here’s what we’ve learned.

Credit Karma vs. Credit Sesame Comparison: What’s the Difference?

Credit Karma and Credit Sesame are the two most popular free credit monitoring services out there. The sites have similar offerings but they’re not identical.

About Credit Karma

Credit Karma homepage

Credit Karma launched in San Francisco in 2007 and Intuit purchased the company in 2020. With more than 100 million subscribers Credit Karma is the largest free credit monitoring service in the United States.

The primary draw of Credit Karma is that it’s free to access your credit score any time you want to see it. However there is so much more to the site than that: resources for your car tax preparation and even a high-yield savings account.

About Credit Sesame

Credit Sesame homepage

Credit Sesame is also free to join and the company says it has “already helped millions of users improve their credit scores increase their approval odds lower the cost of credit and save money.”

Credit Sesame’s membership totals around 17 million according to the company’s website. The Mountain View California-based company launched in 2010.

Both Credit Sesame and Credit Karma offer you unlimited free access to your credit scores whenever you like but there are some differences between the two.

What Are the Differences Between Credit Karma and Credit Sesame?

Neither site requires a credit card to sign up although Credit Sesame offers premium membership levels that charge monthly for some features (more on that later).

Since they offer credit scores for free you might be wondering how these sites make money. Both sites get paid by their advertising partners.

Using an algorithm based on your credit profile and income they make credit card loan and insurance recommendations to members. If someone follows through and signs up for one the site makes money.

Here’s a side-by-side comparison of free services offered by Credit Karma and Credit Sesame:

Credit Karma Credit Sesame Credit scores from TransUnion & Equifax Credit score from TransUnion Credit reports from TransUnion & Equifax Credit report card from TransUnion Credit monitoring Credit monitoring Identity monitoring Identity theft protection & insurance High-yield savings account and fee-free checking account Fee-free checking account Auto value DMV and auto recall information Unclaimed money finder

As you can see Credit Karma offers a much more comprehensive suite of products including:

Auto value recall info and more : Through the site’s Auto Hub you can: See the balance on an auto loan you may have Check to see if refinancing your auto loan could save you money See the current estimated value of your vehicle See any current recalls for your car Check auto insurance rates for someone with your profile

: Through the site’s Auto Hub you can: Unclaimed money finder: Credit Karma provides a resource for people to find unclaimed money. (Clark.com also provides help with this.)

Credit Karma vs. Credit Sesame: Is One Free Service Better Than the Other?

Unlike Credit Karma Credit Sesame offers a paid premium membership for $15.99 per month.

Here’s a look at what the company’s website says paying for Premium will get you.

Premium package from Credit Sesame

Money expert Clark Howard does not recommend signing up for a premium membership because in most cases there are other ways to access these reports for free.

Clark’s Take: Credit Karma and Credit Sesame

Clark is a big fan of both Credit Karma and Credit Sesame but gives the nod to the more robust offerings of Credit Karma.

“What’s fantastic about Credit Karma is their entire suite of free services” he says. “You’re able to monitor your score monitor your credit and know — before you even apply — the likelihood of you being approved for a loan.”

Another valuable protection Clark lives by is a credit freeze. He suggests that you sign up for free credit monitoring with either Credit Karma or Credit Sesame (or both) before you freeze your credit as you may not be able to use those services without unfreezing your credit.

How’s your fantasy life?

Do you ever fantasize about investing in Apple in 1990? Or in Amazon in 2001? Or in Berkshire Hathaway in the ‘70s?

I know a CPA who invested with Warren Buffett in the 1970s. He was strapped for cash once and sold his shares on a whim. He said those shares would be worth millions today. Or did you hear about the guy who sold about 100 Bitcoin to pay off his $600 debt to a friend? He bought some tools from the guy and his friend begrudgingly accepted this questionable payment. That was worth about $4.2 million a decade later (and even after Bitcoin has dropped in 2022 it's still worth about $2 million).

It pays to be in front of the curve.

But let’s be honest. Most of these speculative investments come to nothing and leave their investors disappointed. That’s what happened to me on numerous occasions in earlier decades. It’s hard to predict what will pay off.

Years ago I had a chance to invest in mobile home parks. But like most real estate investors at the time I turned my nose up at the prospect.

That was a major miscalculation.

Sam Zell saw this opportunity before almost anyone else. And his investment in mobile home parks has been part of his formula to become America’s most successful real estate billionaire.

What did Sam see that most of us missed?

The Stigma of Mobile Home Park Investing

I turned my nose up at mobile home park investing for years and in fact I barely considered the prospect. Maybe you’ve felt the same way. This stigma is one of the reasons I now love investing in mobile home parks. There is less competition. However this is changing quickly as many investors at all levels have caught on.

Investors in manufactured housing live where we want to—and invest where it makes sense. And this investment class makes a whole lot of sense to me.

Supply and Demand of Mobile Homes

Manufactured housing is the only asset type I’m aware of that has an increasing demand and a decreasing supply every year. The number of mobile home parks in America is dwindling. Developers are gobbling up the land for other uses or the pressure from city planners results in their demise. Some parks are so old and rundown that they just close up shop. I visited two parks like this in Fairbanks Alaska last year.

At the same time there is an affordable housing crisis in America. It is real and it’s not going away. The number of low-paying jobs is increasing especially when indexing for the current inflation we’re experiencing. Healthcare laws have motivated employers to hire more part-time workers and many young employees don’t have the skills or desire to fill current employment needs.

[Author’s Note: Not long before this post went to press the White House announced major incentives to promote manufactured housing production and to remove barriers to mobile home ownership for millions of Americans. This could be a gamechanger to accelerate the benefits of an already wonderful investment opportunity. Our firm is currently increasing our efforts to seek out mobile home park opportunities on behalf of our investors.]

Have you heard that about 10000 Americans turn 65 daily? Yet 6 in 10 have less than $10000 saved for retirement. This potentially exacerbates the affordability crisis as older Americans are having a tough time affording pricier housing.

Fortunately many of these retirees have home equity and many of them are willing to trade their home equity for a mobile home on a rented lot at a reasonable cost. This gives them their own space drive-up parking a yard and a sense of community.

But it’s not just low-income people who are converting to a mobile home park lifestyle. Keith the father of a dear friend was a respected doctor in southern California. He chaired national councils and golfed with President Ford. When he retired he could have stayed on a southern California beach. But he chose to sell his home and buy a mobile home on a rented park lot near Palm Springs. This freed up cash and resulted in fewer responsibilities and more flexibility as he entered his retirement years.

The affordable housing crisis the supply and demand imbalance and sticky tenants make mobile home park investing a recession-resistant asset type that shouldn’t be overlooked as you build your investment portfolio. Speaking of sticky tenants . . .

Mobile Home Parks Have Long Term Tenants

Mobile homes aren’t really mobile. Tenants tend to stay in mobile home parks for a long time.

Apartment tenants might move to avoid a 7% rent hike. Someone paying $1000 per month is looking at a $70 monthly increase $840 annually by signing that lease. Hiring a moving truck and some willing friends is all it takes to walk away leaving a vacancy. But imagine getting a 7% rate hike in a mobile home park. A new operator comes in and cleans up the park likely adding amenities and increasing safety. You’re paying $350 per month and your increase is $24.50 monthly.

Is it likely you will spend about $5000 to pack up and move that mobile home across town just to save about $25 per month risking damage to the home and all the disruption to your family? Not really.

There is reportedly a 90%+ chance that mobile homes will remain at their original location for the life of that home. Some stats say the average mobile home park dweller remains on their rented lot for about 13 years—many times longer than apartment tenants.

Mobile Home Parks Have Lower Capital Expenses and Maintenance

Well-run manufactured housing communities have the lowest maintenance costs and capital expenses among any asset types we’ve invested in or reviewed. This is because these parks are typically leasing dirt and infrastructure to tenants. Tenants own (or are buying) the mobile homes. This means tenants do maintenance and repairs.

Check out this graphic:

An oral surgeon I spoke to told me of his woes in building a 20-home portfolio to replace his income in retirement. He sounded excited at first. Then he began describing calls to painters between procedures and evening meetings with other contractors and tenants. His excitement gave way to a deep sigh and he said “I really don’t know if I can pull this off. I’m only on my third house and this is driving me crazy.”

I’m in my third decade as a real estate investor. I love the prospect of not dealing with unreliable maintenance and construction crews as well as the toilets and trash that typify many rental properties. Speaking of tenants who own their own mobile homes . . .

Joint Stakeholders

My friend Tony is a medical professional. He owns and leases out 43 apartments on the side. He told me a tenant moved into one of his units on a recent Monday. Then the tenant waited two whole days before setting the unit on fire.

Tony will have to deal with months of hassle insurance bids negotiations demo and construction increased insurance premiums and potential criminal and legal action as a result. This is a risk with any single-family or multifamily rental property.

This is one reason I love mobile home park investing. At least those that are done right where the park owners own the land and infrastructure and then lease the dirt to tenants. Tony’s scenario would not happen at a well-run mobile home park asset.

Tax Efficiency of Investing in Mobile Home Parks

Tax efficiency is one of the most surprising aspects of mobile home park investing. Accelerated depreciation derived from cost segregation studies allows operators to take significant early paper losses from depreciation in the early years of commercial real estate ownership. The 2017 tax law changes allow most of that depreciation to be realized in year 1 of an investment.

Since these assets generally lease dirt to tenants I expected accelerated depreciation to be minimal (since land isn’t depreciable). I was quite mistaken. A typical mobile home park’s value is about 20%-30% land with the balance booked as infrastructure. This means that about 70% or more of the value can be depreciated and the vast majority of that depreciation can be accelerated into year 1 under the current tax law.

Due to the tax classification of most of the infrastructure and the benefits of the new tax code mobile home park operators and their investors usually get a sizable paper loss in year 1 of their ownership. This loss can be about 60%-70% of the acquisition price. When factoring in 50%-70% leverage the investors often receive paper losses well above 100% of their equity investment. These losses can sometimes be used against prior profits or be carried forward for years meaning investors’ cash flow will often not be taxed for a long time.

Medical professionals and other high net worth investors should keep in mind that it’s not how much we make but how much we keep—and for how long—that really matters. Taxes take a massive bite out of our income. But many physicians can hang onto a hundred thousand or more otherwise squandered dollars annually by convincing their spouse to attain real estate professional status (REPS). It won’t work for most but those who pull this off can acquire considerable tax savings.

Mom-and-Pop Owners

This is my favorite thing about investing in mobile home parks. Though I wrote a 2016 book on apartment investing (The Perfect Investment) our firm has found that multifamily is not always “perfect” after all. It’s largely overheated. Many (especially rookie) syndicators have become speculators and we decided not to play that game.

There are more than 40000 mobile home parks in the United States. Though it is hard to track data since the asset type is so fragmented (which we love) it is estimated about 85%-90% of these are owned by mom-and-pops. Single-asset owners running their properties with few systems financial controls marketing revenue management or a sense of professionalism. Even some large parks are still run this way as you’ll see in a moment.

They don’t need to—it wouldn’t be worth the hassle. They have already experienced massive gains in paper value and all they need to do to unlock those gains is to sell the property. That is where a professional operator steps in.

A professional operator can spot intrinsic value in an unprofessionally managed mobile home park. Like Warren Buffett uncovering hidden value in undervalued companies these operators can spot upside that’s invisible to the masses.

They are skilled at uncovering operational inefficiencies bloated operating costs value-add prospects and expansion opportunities. Increasing the net operating income and adding safe leverage provides increased cash flow and accelerated asset appreciation. Plus these operators know how to use the tax code to help their investors delay or avoid taxes on cash flow and sometimes on capital gains.

I have been investing with operators like this for years and I’ve experienced healthy cash flow and outsized appreciation with the benefit of meaningful tax efficiency. We’ll close with an overview of one of these investments.

Southland Mobile Home Community—Louisville Kentucky

Our operating partner acquired Southland Mobile Home Community in Louisville in February 2020 for $7.1 million cash. He purchased this 311-lot property at a 6.5% cap rate on existing net operating income at 81% occupancy. Within a month of acquisition the operator placed conservative (51% LTV) Fannie Mae debt on the project.

The operator purchased this property off-market from a mom-and-pop owner. The park’s original owner had passed away years before and his wife had not visited the park since then. She was several states away and had a manager in charge. Five days after closing on the property the operator received an unsolicited offer for $9.5 million. He turned it down with no counteroffer.

We were a bit surprised he would decline an opportunity for a 33% return on the asset and more importantly a 68% return on the equity within a week. However the operator believed the property would be worth over $13 million after his team executed their value-add strategy within about three years.

The operator saw four ways to create significant value with this project. First operating costs were bloated by more than $60000. As a professional operator with an experienced team our operator brought this into line. This simple change resulted in over $1 million dollars in increased asset value.

Second the operator knew the lot rents were drastically below market (up to 35% low). He planned to raise rents over time. Because of the CRE value formula (Value = Net Operating Income ÷ Cap Rate) a small increase in monthly revenue (with no increased cost) and safe leverage can lead to a large change in value.

Third the previous owner paid for water and sewer for all the tenants. This was common in yesteryear but not in large modern parks (and it is problematic for usage levels). The major local competitors all charged water and sewer to tenants. The operator’s team metered each mobile home and passed these costs back to tenants. The Net Operating Income (NOI) increase was $144094. This simple change resulted in a value increase of over $2.2 million at a 6.5% cap rate.

Lastly there were 50 or so vacant lots. This is a stumbling block for mom-and-pop owners. The most common solution is for the park owner to acquire and set up homes on-site and then try to sell them to new tenants. This requires a lot of capital effort and risk. But there can be a significant payoff by increasing occupancy (especially with new homes).

The operator got through the first three of his four initiatives. He hadn’t undertaken the last one when he received another unsolicited offer he couldn’t refuse. The operator accepted an offer from a large mobile home community operator and closed for $15 million in December 2020. Including cash flow along the way this project generated a 347% IRR (and a 3.4x multiple on invested capital) at the project level over a 10-month hold period.

Here are some additional details for your review.

Conclusion – Are Mobile Home Parks A Good Investment?

While the results of this investment were quite dramatic the process to get there was characteristic for this operating partner. He executes similar strategies on a regular basis and in fact has documented average IRRs of over 60% over multiple years.

I’m glad I took off my blinders to consider this overlooked asset class. I wish I would have done it a decade or more ago but it has still proved to be a great investment for me. Does it make sense for you to take a look as well?

They're not wrong. Historically the housing market has not suffered from the frequent price bubbles and extreme volatility that are seen in other investments. However housing markets can go through periods of irrational exuberance followed by lower demand and lower prices.

A decision to buy or sell a home is far more fraught than trading stocks or bonds. But some of the same principles apply such as looking at long-term averages rather than short-term ups and downs.

Key Takeaways Housing bubbles are temporary periods characterized by high demand low supply and prices that are inflated prices beyond fundamentals.

These bubbles are caused by a variety of factors including rising economic prosperity low-interest rates wider mortgage product offerings and easy access to credit.

Forces that make a housing bubble pop include a downturn in the economy a rise in interest rates and a drop in demand.

What Is a Housing Bubble?

A housing bubble like a sharp increase in the price of any product or service generally begins with a jump in demand and a limited amount of inventory.

The demand grows as more buyers jump into the market. Then the speculators show up snapping up investment properties and flipping fixer-uppers.

With limited supply and so much new demand prices must go up.

Eventually prices can rise to an unsustainable level. Home prices become unaffordable to the average buyer or even the above-average buyer in that region.

A bubble is a temporary event. In the stock market they happen fast and can burst even faster. A housing bubble can persist for several years according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

But at any time external factors can flatten a bubbly housing market. An increase in mortgage rates puts monthly carrying costs out of the reach of more people. An economic downturn causes higher unemployment taking more people out of the pool of homebuyers. Speculators get nervous and stop looking for houses to flip.

What Causes a Housing Market Bubble?

The price of housing like the price of any product or service in a free market is driven by the law of supply and demand. When demand increases or supply decreases prices go up.

In the absence of a natural disaster which can decrease the supply of homes real estate prices rise when demand outpaces supply. The supply of housing can be slow to react because it takes a long time to build or fix up a house. In some urban areas there simply isn't any more land to build on.

So if there is a sudden or prolonged increase in demand prices are sure to rise.

What Drives Housing Demand

Increased demand doesn't occur in a vacuum. There are usually a number of factors at work:

A rise in general economic activity and increased prosperity puts more disposable income in consumers' pockets and encourages homeownership

A demographic segment enters the housing market

Low mortgage rates make homes more affordable

Mortgage products with innovative features like low initial monthly payments make home ownership more accessible

Easy access to credit—often with lower underwriting standards—brings more buyers into the market

Lenders want more mortgage business to feed Wall Street's demand for high-yielding structured mortgage-back securities (MBS)

Loose lending standards make it easier to get a mortgage

Excessive risk-taking by mortgage borrowers

Speculative and risky behavior by home buyers and investors fueled by unrealistic and unsustainable home price appreciation estimates

Some or all of these variables can combine to cause a housing market bubble to form. Indeed all bubbles show the same general pattern: an uptick in activity and prices precedes excessive risk-taking and speculative behavior by all market participants—buyers borrowers lenders builders and investors.

Why Does a Housing Bubble Burst?

A bubble finally bursts when excessive risk-taking becomes pervasive and prices no longer reflect anything close to fundamentals.

In the housing market this will happen when builders continue to build in response to demand that has started tapering off. In other words demand decreases while supply increases. The inevitable results are a slowdown in sales and a decline in price appreciation.

That's not the end of the cycle. As sales slow and prices stop rising the realization of risk reverberates through the market. That realization could be precipitated by a number of things:

An increase in interest rates puts homeownership out of reach for more buyers and in some cases causes financial distress for current homeowners. This often leads to defaults and foreclosures which eventually add to the supply of homes available.

A downturn in general economic activity leads to less disposable income job losses and fewer job openings which decreases the demand for housing. A recession is particularly dangerous.

Demand is exhausted bringing supply and demand into equilibrium and slowing the rapid pace of home price appreciation.

At that point the cycle could be completed. Supply and demand have achieved equilibrium and prices have leveled off. But it can get worse.

As the mood of the market changes credit standards are tightened demand decreases supply increases speculators leave the market and prices start to fall.

What to Do in a Housing Bubble

If you already own a house in an area that is experiencing soaring home prices you'll be tempted to sell. Just remember unless you're planning to move to a less expensive region downsize or rent you're jumping into the bubble. You'll be out there competing with the rest of the homebuyers in a possibly inflated market.

If you're in the market for a home you might consider putting it off for a while. You could wind up overpaying.

The 2007–08 Housing Market Crash

In the mid-2000s the U.S. economy experienced a widespread housing bubble that helped bring on the Great Recession.

It took several years to develop. Following the dotcom bubble values in real estate began to creep up. Low interest rates relaxed lending standards and low down payment requirements encouraged people to borrow beyond their means. This drove home prices up even more.

But many speculative investors stopped buying because the risk was getting too high. Others caught on and got out of the market. And when the economy took a turn for the worse many subprime borrowers found themselves unable to pay their monthly mortgages or refinance them.

This in turn caused prices to drop. Mortgage-backed securities were sold off in massive quantities while mortgage defaults and foreclosures rose to unprecedented levels.

What Is Mean Reversion?

Too often homeowners make the error of assuming that recent price performance will continue into the future. They'd be better off considering long-term rates of price appreciation and the potential for mean reversion.

The laws of physics state that when any object which has a density greater than air is propelled upward it eventually returns to earth because the forces of gravity act upon it. The laws of finance similarly state that markets that go through periods of rapid price appreciation or depreciation will in time revert to a price point that puts them in line with their long-term average rates of appreciation. This is known as reversion to the mean.

Prices in the housing market follow this tendency for mean reversion too. After periods of rapid price appreciation or in some cases depreciation they revert to where their long-term average rates of appreciation indicate they should be.

In home prices mean reversion can be either rapid or gradual. Home prices may move quickly to a point that puts them back in line with the long-term average or they may stay constant until the long-term average catches up with them.

U.S. Housing Price Index

The theoretical value shown above has been derived by calculating the average quarterly percentage increase in the Housing Price Index from the first quarter of 1985 through the fourth quarter of 1998. That is the approximate point at which home prices began to rise rapidly above the long-term trend.

The calculated average quarterly percentage increase was then applied to the starting value shown in the graph and each subsequent value to derive the theoretical Housing Price Index value.

Price Appreciation Estimates

Home buyers tend to use recent price performance as a benchmark for what they expect over the next several years. Based on this unrealistic estimate they take excessive risks.

Excessive risk-taking is usually associated with the choice of a mortgage and the size or cost of the home the consumer purchases.

Relatively short-term mortgage products are heavily marketed to consumers who take this risk. They choose these mortgages based on the expectation that they will be able to refinance in a few years because of the increased equity they will have in their homes.

Recent home price performance is not however a good prediction of future home price performance. Homebuyers should look to long-term rates of home price appreciation and consider the financial principle of mean reversion when making important financing decisions. Speculators should do the same.

Taking risks is not inherently bad. The key to making a good risk-based decision is to base it on a financially sound estimate. This is especially applicable to the largest and most important financial decision most people make—the purchase and financing of a home.

Will the Real Estate Bubble Burst in 2023? There are as many answers to this question as there are economists. The best guess may be based on the trends reported at the end of August 2022 by the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index the leading measure of home prices in the U.S. The index for June 2022 showed a continuing deceleration in price increases. Prices nationwide still increased at a hefty 18% annualized rate compared to 19.9% in the previous month. Case-Shiller's analysis indicates that slowing price appreciation is likely to continue particularly in the metropolitan areas where prices rose most rapidly during the pandemic. Whether prices will actually fall is a tougher call. Fitch Ratings estimates that home prices are overvalued by an average of 11%. That argues for a price ""correction"" particularly in the regions where price appreciation has been steepest starting with parts of the West Coast.

What Causes Housing Prices to Fall? Many factors national and regional have an effect on housing prices. An increase in mortgage rates causes demand to cool. An economic slowdown has an effect. A big demographic trend like baby boomers heading south to retire has an impact. Locally there are even more factors to consider. Cities and neighborhoods become more or less attractive based on local economic conditions tax changes crime rates and the quality of local services.

Which Housing Markets Are Most Overvalued in 2022? One answer to this question can be found in an analysis by researchers at Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University. Their study indicates that the 10 most overvalued cities in the U.S. as of mid-2022 are as follows with the estimated percentage that their home prices exceed their real values: Boise City Idaho 73% Austin Texas 68% Ogden Utah 65% Las Vegas Nevada 61% Atlanta Georgia 58% Phoenix Arizona 58% Provo Utah 57% Fort Myers Florida 56% Spokane Washington 56% Salt Lake City Utah 56%

The Bottom Line

A simple and important principle of finance is mean reversion. While housing markets are not as subject to bubbles as some assets housing bubbles do occur.

Long-term averages provide a good indication of where housing prices will eventually end up during periods of rapid appreciation followed by stagnant or falling prices. The same is true for periods of below-average price appreciation.",,,,,,,,,

TikTok user moneywithmak regularly posts clips sharing tips on how to earn money online.

1 TikTok user moneywithmak said she makes upwards of $1000 per day from Etsy

Mak who runs the account walked through how simple it can be to create an Etsy listing and start generating interest in your products.

In particular Mak advised selling digital products as they don't require you to maintain inventory and can be easily generated.

Popular digital products on Etsy include planners thank you cards logos and schedules.

She said the first step is browsing through erank.com to find trending items you can add to your storefront.

Erank is free to use but does have paid options with more features for more established sellers.

Once you have a digital product in mind she suggested using Canva a free design tool to make your products.

After creating a digital item listing on Etsy Mak recommended adding related key words to the listing to potentially boost its visibility and search engine optimization.

She added that liking your own products or asking friends to like them can help boost your inventory.

In another video about boosting Etsy traffic Mak also said she uses a service called PlaceIt to get high quality mockups and promotional images to use on her storefront.

You can then post these mockups to Pinterest for some free advertising.

Mak said that having quality images to boost your brand with can go a long way toward catching the eyes of potential buyers.

She also said in another video that she uses print on demand to sell some products which can be a profitable and efficent tactic for sellers.

Print on demand allows storefront owners on sites like Etsy to sell products without handling the merchandise themselves.

Sellers who use a print-on-demand fulfillment model can spend more time promoting their brand on social and refining their designs.

Statistics on Etsy sellers

Selling on Etsy can be a very profitable hustle as the platform's top earners rake in more than $65000 annually according to SaleSamurai.

The average Etsy seller generates around $45000 each year but those numbers are skewed by the site's top stores.

Roughly two-thirds of Etsy users earn less than $100 annually according to StatisticBrain.

Etsy also charges 20 cents per product you list on the platform and takes 6.5% of sales as commission.

The tax implications of a side hustle

Whether you work a side hustle in addition to a full-time job or juggle multiple part-time gigs your earnings are taxable.

Not only that but you need to report your earnings from a side hustle or freelance job differently than you report standard income.

A Form 1040 is required for those with multiple sources of income as you have to list all your income on a single form.

In addition you'll need to file a Schedule C and a Form SE to report your self-employment taxes.

If you have multiple streams of income speaking to a tax professional can help you sort out what forms you need to submit and how to properly fill them out.

The additional income may also move your household into a different tax bracket which will impact how much you have to pay the IRS.

Working a side hustle does allow you to claim more exemptions on your taxes however as you can report your expenses for potential tax deductions.

You'll need to have proof of the money you spent on your side hustle though so make sure to keep any relevant receipts for tax season.

Greece-based artist Melpomeni Chatzipanagiotou pairs her love of portraying nature with organic materials in an ongoing series of drawings and paintings on wood. These small tactile pieces depict a range dreamy scenes encompassed by a border of real lumber.

Chatzipanagiotou renders her subjects using a limited color palette of black and white blue and some metallics. As a result she is able to create a striking contrast of light and dark that pops out from the wood. While some of these pieces feature paintings that have been made directly onto the plank others include drawings on paper that have been mounted on the base. “A principal theme in my work is the natural habitat and its living inhabitants with an otherworldly touch” Chatzipanagiotou tells My Modern Met. “My work and interests are very broad but I often explore themes that are connected to our Earth and Cosmic Universe.”

These bewitching works of art appear to blend reality and imagination resulting in captivating combinations of nature space and more. “With a profound need to try and communicate my thoughts feelings and stories through the making of dense and detailed art” Chatzipanagiotou continues. “Each art piece I create is uniquely hand-drawn with a mixed media of materials pens inks gouache acrylic paint and I like to work both on paper and wood.”

You can purchase available art via Chatzipanagiotou's Etsy shop and pre-order her newest coloring book (coming in February 2023) on Amazon. Keep up to date with her latest projects by following the artist on Instagram.

The open-concept floor plan is a product of changing times in American social history and construction technology. According to The Old-House Journal around the start of the 20th century building materials had advanced enough to allow for a shift in how load-bearing walls were placed throughout a home and central heating and cooling meant that rooms no longer required individual considerations for environmental comfort.

Similarly the social norms changed around this point leading adult members of family units to spend more time actively engaged in routine household maintenance tasks. A layout change was inevitable given these unique conditions and an interior space that provided a more versatile and easy-flowing movement throughout the property became the standard rather than the exception to the interior and physical design of newly built properties across the United States.

Yet for all the positivity that open-concept floor plans have brought about through their heyday (e.g. natural light enhancement sightline optimization and entertainment maximization per New Home Source) the open-concept style has begun to fade from popularity in recent years.

There are many reasons why a homeowner might want to run away from the open-concept design but a number of opportunities for enjoyment and personal fulfillment can be unlocked with this type of property as well. The truth is is that this floor plan can be highly beneficial for some families and a scourge to others.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBob2Jsb2dyYXBoZXIuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDQvaXQta2VlcHMtZ2V0dGluZy1iZXR0ZXItbWF0dGVycG9ydC1wcm8zLXJldmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Matterport Pro3 Review: It Keeps Getting Better,"Spread the love

The pandemic created a paradigm shift and allowed people to work remotely from a location of their choice. Given the freedom to relocate workers changed the entire real estate landscape as we knew it. Properties were selling unseen and realtors needed images delivered yesterday. Time was money and it was also becoming a dwindling resource. As a result automation became a new currency. And that’s where the Matterport Pro3 comes into play.

We hate banner ads too. Download our app for iOS iPad and Android and get no banner ads for $24.99/year.

Realtors now rely on virtual tours creative content and fast turnaround times. Matterport has been an industry leader with its immersive 3D experience. The Pro3 takes what was already working well and improves upon it. Scan times are now less than 20 seconds and cost average-sized spaces only take a few hours to upload.

Pricing for the Matterport Pro3 camera starts at $5999 and the brand offers add-on subscriptions for an extra monthly fee. The starter pack has a monthly fee of $9.99. It offers analytics and the ability to publish directly to the Realtor website. Is the all-in-one workhorse worth the investment? Keep reading to find out more.

The Big Picture

Matterport Pro3 is a simple all-inclusive option for real estate and commercial property photographers. You only need an iPhone iPad or Android device and a sturdy tripod. Each scan takes less than 20 seconds and uploads are ready promptly.

The Digital Twin Platform equips users with 3D dollhouse views and a virtual space tour. Users can take a snapshot while editing the space to be uploaded to the MLS listing. Traditional black and white floorplans are available for an extra fee.

Most untrained eyes and paying clients will be thrilled with the HDR results. Natural light images are realistic with subtle shadows and sunlight coming in through the windows. However non-daylight balanced light bulbs cast noticeable tints.

Working photographers may want to develop a new workflow if they aren’t already outsourcing. That is if the price of the job is right. Otherwise the initial results are pretty sufficient for most clients.

We are giving the Matterport Pro3 four out of five stars. If it were possible to fine-tune the HDR results within the digital twin this would receive a higher rating.

Pros And Cons

Pros

Easy to use

Ability to capture real estate images from Matterport scans

Significantly cuts down on production time

Most clients will be pleased with HDR results.

Virtual tours are fun and can sell properties fast.

20-second capture speed

Online spaces are simple and easy to use.

Great all-in-one setup

Cons

It’s expensive.

I wish there were an option to fine-tune the HDR results.

Lights that aren’t daylight balanced can create awkward tints and color shifts.

The connection sometimes gets lost in old buildings with thick walls.

Noticeable wide distortion in small spaces as expected

Gear Used

We tested the Matterport Pro3 with an iPhone 11 16″ Macbook Pro and Vanguard Veo 3+ tripod. The Pro3 camera was a loan from Matterport.

Innovations

Matterport took what was already great with its cortex AI and improved the immersive experience. Scan times are drastically faster image quality is better and overall accuracy is improved. All the upgrades come in a much smaller package than its predecessor. The company continues its quest to make 3D imaging widely acceptable and easy to use. Its cloud-based digital twin technology is intuitive and straightforward to use.

Ergonomics

The Matterport Pro3 camera is ultra-portable. It spans a little more than seven inches and weighs less than five pounds. The camera comes with a padded carrying case making it easy to commute on two wheels.

The ultra-wide 12-blade lens is located on the front of the unit.

This is what it looks like from the side.

And here is a closer crop of the laser.

The power button and small display are located on the back of the Pro3.

Battery access is on the bottom. This is also where a tripod mount attaches to the Matterport camera.

Build Quality

Matterport’s Pro3 is small compact and feels solid. It comes in a padded carrying case with a strong handle. The Pro3 isn’t fully weather-proof or dustproof but it can withstand a moderately light rain. I’d recommend letting it dry and ensuring the lens is clear before using it indoors again. It will ensure the laser isn’t refracting light through any moisture and produce the best results.

Ease Of Use

Anyone with an iOS or Android device can operate the Matterport Pro3. Download the Capture App from the app store and establish a connection between the devices. Mount the camera five feet above the ground to a tripod get out of sight and begin capturing your space for your digital twin. The camera will rotate four times and do the rest.

A digital twin is a digital copy of a real-world place or object. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies enable the creation of digital twins which are dimensionally accurate 3D digital models that can be updated quickly to reflect changes with its physical counterpart. -Matterport

A good rule of thumb for large spaces is scanning one day and then uploading overnight. Edit the space on the following day for a two-day client turnaround. Smaller spaces can be delivered within 24 hours. The quick delivery time will keep realtors at bay.

Capture App

The Capture App is straightforward to use. Simply decide whether you are creating a 3D space or capturing a 360-degree scan for that space. I recommend opting for the complete scan to get the best results.

It’s easiest to start in a corner and then move through a space. Be advantageous with the placement of your scans if you plan on using snapshots for the listing.

From there continue moving strategically throughout the space and watch the floorplan come to life. The black spots you see indicate that details are missing. Take the time to create extra scans and fill in the details. It is better to have too many scans and remove them later.

Be mindful of the user experience. I found three paces to be a good distance between scans indoors. It isn’t too jumpy and makes for a pleasant virtual tour. Outdoor areas do not require as much work. Also mark windows mirrors and where you want to trim. It will yield the highest-quality result when you’re ready to upload it.

Matterport recommends completing the stairway scans and get the next floor in view for multi-level buildings. Then create a new floor and scan away. It should mitigate the hassle of any misalignment issues.

Cloud-Based Spaces

Most average-sized spaces will be available to work on within several hours after uploading. I recommend embarking on the virtual tour first to get an idea of the primary focal rooms you want to showcase. It’s a great way to get a feel of the space and a lot of fun.

Kitchens living rooms and master suites are always a great choice. Then enter edit mode capture snapshots and begin creating your project.

Matterport’s offerings allow photographers to create various packages. I would offer MLS images and a virtual tour as a standard and charge accordingly.

From there I would offer the virtual floorplan traditional floorplan and dollhouse 3D view as an optional add-on. You can also take snapshots with virtual measurements if your clients request it.

If you want to begin your presentation with a floorplan or 3D dollhouse view:

Pick the focal room as the start of the virtual tour.

From there navigate through the space and delete any unnecessary scans.

Gather snapshots along the way for the MLS.

The snapshots are available under Downloads and can be delivered to your clients in one email.

Image Quality

The Matterport Pro3 creates realistic HDR images and balances the light with multiple exposures. There is noticeable distortion from the wide angle lens in tight spaces as would be expected. Images are sharp with subtle shadows adequate window pulls in most lighting situations. Dramatic light can resemble computer generated images.

The Matterport captures six images with shutter speeds ranging from 1/5th to 1/5000th of a second. The worst image gets tossed while the rest are blended and balanced for the most pleasing user experience.

The Pro3 does well in mixed lighting situations with ample natural light available. It is a good idea to recommend daylight balanced light bulbs to your clients before photographing a space. Varying lighting color temperatures can be glaringly obvious. The different shades create undesirable tints and color shifts throughout spaces just like DSLR and mirrorless cameras.

It isn’t possible to correct it within the app nor is it possible to turn down the HDR effect. These features would be fantastic additions in the future. Scenes that lack natural light and rely on other sources of light can look like CGI awfully fast. However your average client wouldn’t get hung up on this detail. It’s also worth mentioning that often-blown window highlights are quite good.

The Pro3 also does a very nice job with natural light images. I appreciate the subtle shadows and playful light on the wall. It provides the viewer with a real look at the space by adding ambiance. The lights off crew might be less enthusiastic as they tend to prefer flat walls. Even though their images are more natural with colors the shadowless walls are unrealistic. These photographers will also most likely opt to create an external workflow and fine tune the snapshots to their liking.

Extra Image Samples

From day one The Phoblographer has been huge on transparency with our audience. Nothing from this review is sponsored. Further lots of folks will post reviews and show lots of editing in the photos. The problem then becomes that anyone and everyone can do the same thing. They’re not showing what the product can do. So we have a section in our Extra Image Samples area to show edited and unedited photos. From this you can make a decision for yourself.

Who Should Buy The Matterport Pro3 Camera?

Photographers looking to improve their turnaround time while offering numerous products should buy the Matterport Pro3. The ultra-portable camera is easy to use and incredibly efficient. The 3D tours are really enjoyable.

Photographers who work in the industry may be a little more hesitant. Signature styles are a thing and the HDR images aren’t perfect. However the only people who will scoff at that are other photographers. We hope to see Matterport add minor editing functionality in the future for even better images.

Your average client will enjoy the immersive experience and appreciate the image quality. The amount of time saved alone makes it a worthwhile investment. Real estate photographers can start reclaiming their precious time and keeping realtors happy.

The mobile platform is an impressive one-stop shop for most real estate and commercial property needs. Additionally the Matterport system is great for insurance and disaster claims. We look forward to what Matterport has planned next.

In 2021 the number of Black-owned businesses in the U.S. grew 38% from pre-pandemic numbers—becoming the fastest-growing entrepreneurial group according to Bloomberg.

In Baton Rouge the Baton Rouge Metropolitan Black Chamber of Commerce is seeing—and helping foster—a similar trend. All over town Black entrepreneurs and professionals continue to open new virtual and bricks-and-mortar businesses at an increasing rate.

The chamber founded in 2018 provides Black professionals and people of color opportunities to build their network and community as well as gain access to funding professional development and financial literacy. It aims to empower business owners to be successful and sustainable.

“We are entering a renaissance era in Baton Rouge” says executive director Myra N. Richardson. “There are people under the age of 40 developing property all over town. Baton Rouge is at a moment to pivot.”

Richardson who also coaches businesses on strategic planning and marketing through her firm Red Torch Consulting became the chamber’s executive director in January 2022.

In May the organization opened its official headquarters at the ExxonMobil Community Center on Scenic Highway.

“Our office is now housed at the ExxonMobil Community Center because they’re one of the organizations who stepped up and said they want to have a critical role in moving Black and brown businesses forward” Richardson says. “So now we’re able to have programming and we’re serving businesses every day.”

Since she became director the chamber has grown by the hundreds surging from 28 to 370 members. She plans to continue widening its network as the organization celebrates its five-year anniversary in 2023.

Even beyond membership growth 2022 has been the organization’s most active year yet.

It has hosted a community bike ride with Geaux Ride as well as in-person and virtual workshops on taxes financial literacy and the art of marketing for small businesses. And just last month it hosted a business market and festival at the Main Library at Goodwood with vendors live music and food trucks.

This flurry of activity is making an impact.

“Engaging building and supporting minority-owned businesses is the key to peace prosperity and progress in our city” says Mayor Sharon Weston Broome whose administration has aimed to grow small local businesses and increase opportunities for socially and economically disadvantaged groups. “Partners such as the Black Chamber of Commerce are essential to this work.”

The Chamber’s online members directory is a resource for those looking to shop support or collaborate with Black-owned businesses.

It features entrepreneurs organizations and companies from all areas. It’s categorized by business type including advertising and media finance and insurance legal health care transportation real estate and wellness and personal services such as beauty salons childcare and counseling.

“Even if you’re not Black community partners can support the chamber” Richardson says. “You can create space for opportunity. I have been counted out for so long in my life. I don’t want any young person to feel that way. In this organization there’s a place for everybody.”

There are many ways to get involved with the Black Chamber of Commerce.

Locals can apply online for a membership as an individual student university church nonprofit or business.

Members have the opportunity to be spotlighted on the organization’s website and social media included in the online directory get notified about upcoming local events and have their announcements broadcasted to the Black Chamber of Commerce network.

Moving forward Richardson plans to engage with new partners continue fundraising and complete the chamber’s strategic plan for the future of the Black Chamber of Commerce.

“This is the opportunity for us to stop surviving and start thriving” Richardson says. “Everyone can have a piece of the pie.” brmbcc.org

The publishing of the terms and scope for the Uaru development prior to embarking on an EIA is something that environmentalists have been advocating for. However the EPA has largely withheld publishing them prior to the completion of the EIA.

Back in April Esso Exploration and Produc-tion Guyana Limited (EEPGL) approached the EPA for an environmental permit to develop the Uaru field. The discovery at the Uaru-2 well in the Stabroek Block was made in late April of last year and was ExxonMobil’s 19th discovery offshore Guyana. In January 2020 a release from ExxonMobil announced that Uaru-1 was the 16th discovery in the Stabroek Block. The well encountered approximately 94 feet (29 meters) of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoir and was drilled in 6342 feet (1933 meters) of water.

The Uaru project is expected to see the drilling of approximately 40 to 76 development wells including production water injection and gas re-injection wells; installation and operation of subsea umbilicals risers and flowlines (SURF) equipment; the installation and operation of a Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel – inclusive of handling and offloading of produced hydrocarbon; and ultimately decommissioning.

Onshore logistical support facilities such as shore bases warehouses storage and pipe yards fabrication facilities fuel supply facilities waste management facilities and marine/aviation services will be utilised to support each stage of the project.

Acorn International is the EIA consultant for the Uaru project.

According to EEPGL the locations of the Uaru Development wells have not yet been finalised however the wells are anticipated to be drilled from ten drill centres. During drilling and installation of the FPSO/SURF facilities work may be performed in a subsea area within the project development area (PDA) that could potentially cover an estimated 9500 hectares (37 square miles). This area according to the scope documents is referred to as the Subsea PDA. Much of this subsea area will not involve physical disturbance of the seafloor except where the SURF equipment and the FPSO mooring system are sited.

The Environmental Protect Act (EP-Act) outlines the minimum requirements of an EIA and according to the published scope the Uaru EIA is expected to encompass that in addition to other requirements. The standard requirements mandate the EIA team to provide detailed descriptions of the geographical area involv-ed the physical characteristics of the whole project and the area requirements during the installation and operational phases including plans and drawings. They are also required to provide information on the characteristics of the installation and the production process including the nature and quantity of the materials used plans and drawings; an estimate by type and quantity (or concentrations as appropriate) of expected contaminants residues and emissions (water air and soil pollution noise vibration light heat radiation) resulting from the operation of the proposed Project; and the length of time of the Project.

Cumulative impacts

The EIA is also expected to state and address the direct indirect and cumulative impacts of the project on the environment including human beings; flora fauna and species habitats; water; marine soil; air and climate; cultural heritage and sea-scape; natural resources; ecological balance; and any other environmental factors to be considered.

Moreover the study must also include detailed descriptions of any hazards or dangers which may arise from the project and an assessment of the risk to the environment; the measures that the proposed Developer intends to use to mitigate any adverse effects and a statement of reasonable alternatives (if any) and reasons for their rejection; a statement of the degree of irreversible damage and an explanation of how it is assessed; an Oil Spill Response Plan for containing and cleaning up any pollution or spill of any contaminant; the Developer’s programme for rehabilitation and restoration of the environment; and a non-technical summary of the information provided.

The final terms and scope document states that the EIA report shall focus on significant environmental issues and must provide all the relevant information needed by the EPA to consider fully any adverse or beneficial impacts of the proposal. When it comes to the regulatory framework where not covered by local laws the EIA consultant is expected to be guided by the World Bank International Maritime Organization (IMO) International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution by Ships 1973 as modified by the Protocol of 1978 (MARPOL 73/78) and World Health Organization.

The EIA consultants are mandated to address the concerns raised during the public consultations including during the scoping and disclosure meetings. The EIA Report must demonstrate that public concerns have been adequately considered by suggesting possible modifications to the project proposal or by clarification of items within the document the document states.

It added that all public consultation results must be documented and relevant records included in the appendices of the EIA. Those records shall also contain details on the manner in which the public was notified the groups targeted a description of the stakeholder consultation process a list of all stakeholder groups included in the process the number of meetings held location of the meetings dates held minutes of all meetings a copy of the survey questionnaires used (if any) and the results of surveys.

With Uaru projected as EEPGL’s fifth undertaking in the Stabroek Block the EIAs from the Liza 1 and 2 Payara and Yellowtail projects contain information that may be relevant to the Uaru project. Catering for this the final terms and scope document states that baseline chapters must contain sufficient information to enable an assessment of the consequences on that specific resource/receptor imposed by the Project for each phase of the Project including construction operation and closure.

Area of Influence

“All readily available information including representative information and baseline data relevant to the proposed Project site and the direct and indirect area of influence (AOI) will be assembled and reviewed including local maps and any existing EIAs. This includes relevant studies conducted for prior EIAs (Liza Phase 1 Liza Phase 2 Payara and Yellowtail) as well as the associated post permitting and/or ongoing studies conducted by the Developer (granted no objection by the EPA). This information should be considered and utilised in establishing baseline conditions relevant to the proposed Project for the assessment of environmental and social impacts.

“The EIA will determine and delineate the actual AOI by considering the extent of direct and indirect interactions between the proposed Project and the physical biological and social environments. The review should as far as possible examine publicly available documents held by but not limited to the EPA the GGMC the Ministry of Natural Resources and other local authorities and NGOs. The review will also examine data on environmental economic and social variables which may include site geology hydrogeology surface water flow land use in the Project area and its vicinity the proximity of indigenous communities and the likely presence of archaeological resources in the area etc” the document outlines.

Acorn International will be expected to undertake field and additional studies to fill the data gaps to enable a comprehensive description of the baseline data for the specific medium as necessary to update existing information where appropriate. Sufficient detail must be given to allow a clear understanding of the likely negative impacts of the proposed project and to assess the effectiveness of any proposed mitigation measures.

The consultant is tasked with identifying all impacts that could arise during each phase of the operation and distinguishing where applicable between negative and positive impacts direct and indirect impacts immediate short-term and long-term impacts and cumulative impacts. In analysing the impacts consideration shall be given to where applicable geographical extent intensity frequency uncertainty and reversibility. They are also entrusted with ensuring that mitigation measures and monitoring are presented in the ESMP. The ESMP shall be the management plan that seeks to manage identified potential impacts and environmental issues resulting from the project.

Mitigation measures shall specifically describe how impacts would be handled to prevent a cumulative effect with respect to the intended project.

Acorn International will also have to conduct a high-level assessment of the cumulative socioeconomic and environmental effects that are likely to result from the proposed activities in combination with other existing approved and proposed projects in the area of impact. The cumulative assessment must be based on an adequate understanding of the design and operation of the proposed activity as well as other existing approved and proposed projects. The Uaru EIA must include a high-level cumulative impacts assessment of the marine traffic risk climate change/LCDS 2030 onshore 3rd party facilities and other public service and infrastructure capacity.

A description of the Uaru decommissioning must be provided in the EIA along with a description of activities associated with this phase taking into account environmental considerations. The preliminary decommissioning plan provided in the EIA study must include the regulatory framework guiding the programme methods of waste removal post-decommissioning monitoring and an overview of all the installations to be decommissioned.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZGVtZXJhcmF3YXZlcy5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wNC9ndXlhbmEtcHJvamVjdGVkLXRvLWVhcm4tdXMxLWJpbGxpb24tZnJvbS1vaWwtdGhpcy15ZWFyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Guyana projected to earn US$1 billion from oil this year,"Last Updated on Sunday 4 September 2022 0:52 by Denis Chabrol

Guyana is expected to earn US$1.1 billion from 13 lifts as its entitlement from the ExxonMobil-led consortium due to the Russia-Ukraine war Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited (EEPGL) according to the Ministry of Finances mid-year report.

“Government is now projected to earn US$1.1 billion as revenue from the sale of our share of profit oil and US$147.7 million in royalties in 2022 subject to the evolution of world market prices” states the report delivered under the hand of Finance Minister Dr Ashni Singh.

The report states that Guyana is forecast to still receive 13 lifts of profit oil from the Stabroek Block this year but the country was poised to cash in on higher world oil prices as a result of the conflict. “With the price of crude oil ballooning after the Russian invasion of Ukraine NRF deposits are now projected to be 32.5 percent higher than the US$957.6 million projected at the time of preparing Budget 2022” the report states.

During January to June 2022 Government had five lifts of profit oil from the two producing Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessels- three from Liza Destiny and two from Liza Unity. The report explains that in the first half of the year Government received US$307 million as revenue from their share of profit oil and US$37.1 million in royalties. According to the document the total balance inclusive of interest income at the end of June was US$753.3 million after a withdrawal of US$200 million in the month of May.

The Ministry of Finance states that the petroleum sector expanded by an estimated 73.5 percent with 34.6 million barrels of

oil produced in the first half of the year. This was the result of the commencement of oil production at the Liza Unity FPSO in February.

The mid-year report also says that Guyana recorded an overall real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 36.4 percent in the first half of the year with the non-oil economy growing by 8.3 percent reflecting Government’s supportive policy stance.

The outlook for the second half continues to be favourable. For the full year real GDP growth in 2022 is now projected at 56 percent overall and non-oil GDP growth at 9.6 percent maintaining Guyana’s position of global leader in economic growth."

They're not wrong. Historically the housing market has not suffered from the frequent price bubbles and extreme volatility that are seen in other investments. However housing markets can go through periods of irrational exuberance followed by lower demand and lower prices.

A decision to buy or sell a home is far more fraught than trading stocks or bonds. But some of the same principles apply such as looking at long-term averages rather than short-term ups and downs.

Key Takeaways Housing bubbles are temporary periods characterized by high demand low supply and prices that are inflated prices beyond fundamentals.

These bubbles are caused by a variety of factors including rising economic prosperity low-interest rates wider mortgage product offerings and easy access to credit.

Forces that make a housing bubble pop include a downturn in the economy a rise in interest rates and a drop in demand.

What Is a Housing Bubble?

A housing bubble like a sharp increase in the price of any product or service generally begins with a jump in demand and a limited amount of inventory.

The demand grows as more buyers jump into the market. Then the speculators show up snapping up investment properties and flipping fixer-uppers.

With limited supply and so much new demand prices must go up.

Eventually prices can rise to an unsustainable level. Home prices become unaffordable to the average buyer or even the above-average buyer in that region.

A bubble is a temporary event. In the stock market they happen fast and can burst even faster. A housing bubble can persist for several years according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

But at any time external factors can flatten a bubbly housing market. An increase in mortgage rates puts monthly carrying costs out of the reach of more people. An economic downturn causes higher unemployment taking more people out of the pool of homebuyers. Speculators get nervous and stop looking for houses to flip.

What Causes a Housing Market Bubble?

The price of housing like the price of any product or service in a free market is driven by the law of supply and demand. When demand increases or supply decreases prices go up.

In the absence of a natural disaster which can decrease the supply of homes real estate prices rise when demand outpaces supply. The supply of housing can be slow to react because it takes a long time to build or fix up a house. In some urban areas there simply isn't any more land to build on.

So if there is a sudden or prolonged increase in demand prices are sure to rise.

What Drives Housing Demand

Increased demand doesn't occur in a vacuum. There are usually a number of factors at work:

A rise in general economic activity and increased prosperity puts more disposable income in consumers' pockets and encourages homeownership

A demographic segment enters the housing market

Low mortgage rates make homes more affordable

Mortgage products with innovative features like low initial monthly payments make home ownership more accessible

Easy access to credit—often with lower underwriting standards—brings more buyers into the market

Lenders want more mortgage business to feed Wall Street's demand for high-yielding structured mortgage-back securities (MBS)

Loose lending standards make it easier to get a mortgage

Excessive risk-taking by mortgage borrowers

Speculative and risky behavior by home buyers and investors fueled by unrealistic and unsustainable home price appreciation estimates

Some or all of these variables can combine to cause a housing market bubble to form. Indeed all bubbles show the same general pattern: an uptick in activity and prices precedes excessive risk-taking and speculative behavior by all market participants—buyers borrowers lenders builders and investors.

Why Does a Housing Bubble Burst?

A bubble finally bursts when excessive risk-taking becomes pervasive and prices no longer reflect anything close to fundamentals.

In the housing market this will happen when builders continue to build in response to demand that has started tapering off. In other words demand decreases while supply increases. The inevitable results are a slowdown in sales and a decline in price appreciation.

That's not the end of the cycle. As sales slow and prices stop rising the realization of risk reverberates through the market. That realization could be precipitated by a number of things:

An increase in interest rates puts homeownership out of reach for more buyers and in some cases causes financial distress for current homeowners. This often leads to defaults and foreclosures which eventually add to the supply of homes available.

A downturn in general economic activity leads to less disposable income job losses and fewer job openings which decreases the demand for housing. A recession is particularly dangerous.

Demand is exhausted bringing supply and demand into equilibrium and slowing the rapid pace of home price appreciation.

At that point the cycle could be completed. Supply and demand have achieved equilibrium and prices have leveled off. But it can get worse.

As the mood of the market changes credit standards are tightened demand decreases supply increases speculators leave the market and prices start to fall.

What to Do in a Housing Bubble

If you already own a house in an area that is experiencing soaring home prices you'll be tempted to sell. Just remember unless you're planning to move to a less expensive region downsize or rent you're jumping into the bubble. You'll be out there competing with the rest of the homebuyers in a possibly inflated market.

If you're in the market for a home you might consider putting it off for a while. You could wind up overpaying.

The 2007–08 Housing Market Crash

In the mid-2000s the U.S. economy experienced a widespread housing bubble that helped bring on the Great Recession.

It took several years to develop. Following the dotcom bubble values in real estate began to creep up. Low interest rates relaxed lending standards and low down payment requirements encouraged people to borrow beyond their means. This drove home prices up even more.

But many speculative investors stopped buying because the risk was getting too high. Others caught on and got out of the market. And when the economy took a turn for the worse many subprime borrowers found themselves unable to pay their monthly mortgages or refinance them.

This in turn caused prices to drop. Mortgage-backed securities were sold off in massive quantities while mortgage defaults and foreclosures rose to unprecedented levels.

What Is Mean Reversion?

Too often homeowners make the error of assuming that recent price performance will continue into the future. They'd be better off considering long-term rates of price appreciation and the potential for mean reversion.

The laws of physics state that when any object which has a density greater than air is propelled upward it eventually returns to earth because the forces of gravity act upon it. The laws of finance similarly state that markets that go through periods of rapid price appreciation or depreciation will in time revert to a price point that puts them in line with their long-term average rates of appreciation. This is known as reversion to the mean.

Prices in the housing market follow this tendency for mean reversion too. After periods of rapid price appreciation or in some cases depreciation they revert to where their long-term average rates of appreciation indicate they should be.

In home prices mean reversion can be either rapid or gradual. Home prices may move quickly to a point that puts them back in line with the long-term average or they may stay constant until the long-term average catches up with them.

U.S. Housing Price Index

The theoretical value shown above has been derived by calculating the average quarterly percentage increase in the Housing Price Index from the first quarter of 1985 through the fourth quarter of 1998. That is the approximate point at which home prices began to rise rapidly above the long-term trend.

The calculated average quarterly percentage increase was then applied to the starting value shown in the graph and each subsequent value to derive the theoretical Housing Price Index value.

Price Appreciation Estimates

Home buyers tend to use recent price performance as a benchmark for what they expect over the next several years. Based on this unrealistic estimate they take excessive risks.

Excessive risk-taking is usually associated with the choice of a mortgage and the size or cost of the home the consumer purchases.

Relatively short-term mortgage products are heavily marketed to consumers who take this risk. They choose these mortgages based on the expectation that they will be able to refinance in a few years because of the increased equity they will have in their homes.

Recent home price performance is not however a good prediction of future home price performance. Homebuyers should look to long-term rates of home price appreciation and consider the financial principle of mean reversion when making important financing decisions. Speculators should do the same.

Taking risks is not inherently bad. The key to making a good risk-based decision is to base it on a financially sound estimate. This is especially applicable to the largest and most important financial decision most people make—the purchase and financing of a home.

Will the Real Estate Bubble Burst in 2023? There are as many answers to this question as there are economists. The best guess may be based on the trends reported at the end of August 2022 by the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index the leading measure of home prices in the U.S. The index for June 2022 showed a continuing deceleration in price increases. Prices nationwide still increased at a hefty 18% annualized rate compared to 19.9% in the previous month. Case-Shiller's analysis indicates that slowing price appreciation is likely to continue particularly in the metropolitan areas where prices rose most rapidly during the pandemic. Whether prices will actually fall is a tougher call. Fitch Ratings estimates that home prices are overvalued by an average of 11%. That argues for a price ""correction"" particularly in the regions where price appreciation has been steepest starting with parts of the West Coast.

What Causes Housing Prices to Fall? Many factors national and regional have an effect on housing prices. An increase in mortgage rates causes demand to cool. An economic slowdown has an effect. A big demographic trend like baby boomers heading south to retire has an impact. Locally there are even more factors to consider. Cities and neighborhoods become more or less attractive based on local economic conditions tax changes crime rates and the quality of local services.

Which Housing Markets Are Most Overvalued in 2022? One answer to this question can be found in an analysis by researchers at Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University. Their study indicates that the 10 most overvalued cities in the U.S. as of mid-2022 are as follows with the estimated percentage that their home prices exceed their real values: Boise City Idaho 73% Austin Texas 68% Ogden Utah 65% Las Vegas Nevada 61% Atlanta Georgia 58% Phoenix Arizona 58% Provo Utah 57% Fort Myers Florida 56% Spokane Washington 56% Salt Lake City Utah 56%

The Bottom Line

A simple and important principle of finance is mean reversion. While housing markets are not as subject to bubbles as some assets housing bubbles do occur.

Long-term averages provide a good indication of where housing prices will eventually end up during periods of rapid appreciation followed by stagnant or falling prices. The same is true for periods of below-average price appreciation.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The FedEx Ground network relies upon local delivery companies to make the package and parcel dropoffs on behalf of the $54 billion multinational conglomerate.

But now one of the largest delivery contractors is warning that the entire system is on the brink of falling apart with local workers unable to absorb any more rising costs.

'The FedEx Ground network is in far more peril than what anyone realizes. If Wall Street analysts if FedEx corporate and FedEx ground understood the degree to which the network is in danger there would be widespread panic' said Spencer Patton President of Route Consultant.

FedEx Ground delivery contractors have been demanding higher pay and changes to operations with profit margins squeezed due to inflation

FedEx Ground works by utilizing the services of around 6000 small businesses that are under contract with the company in order to make doorstep deliveries.

Patton who controls a fleet of 275 delivery trucks and has 225 employees across 10 states on his books is looking for a raise of 50-cent per stop for delivery contractors and a 20-cent increase for long-haul trucking contractors by the end of November 25 the start of the holiday shipping season.

Patton was hoping to negotiate directly with FedEx Ground and had set up a 10-member committee in the hope of focusing their attention.

Patton insists that he is not attempting to set up a union - despite the setup looking remarkably similar.

'FedEx Ground has no network without contractors. And we have no network without FedEx Ground. So we are inextricably linked here together in our mutual destiny' Patton told Insider.

'The FedEx Ground network is in far more peril than what anyone realizes. If Wall Street analysts if FedEx corporate and FedEx ground understood the degree to which the network is in danger there would be widespread panic' said Spencer Patton President of Route Consultant who operated 225 trucks across 10 states

Patton first raised the alarm earlier this year when fuel prices began to rise and wrote two letters signed by hundreds of contractors to FedEx Ground management

Contractors are facing the squeeze due to the rising costs of fuel labor and trucks.

Patton first raised the alarm earlier this year when fuel prices began to rise and wrote two letters signed by hundreds of contractors to FedEx Ground management.

He has argued how up to 35% of FedEx Ground delivery providers are at risk of financial failure and urged its leaders to improve compensation and has been rallying peers to his cause.

CEO John Smith simply responded by telling the contractors how the company looked at fuel compensation in the contracts and decided no special action was necessary.

'We recognize the shifting market dynamics and current economic conditions may pose new challenges for service provider businesses and we remain committed to working with these businesses to create opportunities for continued success' a FedEx spokesperson said in a statement.

FedEx doesn’t employ drivers for its Ground operation and instead relies on contractors — often small operations with tight profit margins

But Patton's very public statement appears to have ruffled feathers and FedEx has now severed links with him and suing him describing his messaging as 'spreading misinformation about its business for financial gain.'

In its lawsuit FedEx alleged that Patton is disparaging its Ground business through a series of false and misleading statements about its commercial activities.

FedEx says the escalating conflict is harming its business and forcing it to spend money on damage control.

Unfavorable news coverage stemming from Patton's campaign could harm Ground's reputation with the shippers that pay it to deliver packages and to erode goodwill within the contractor network FedEx alleged in its complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee.

Patton did not address the merits of the case and went public with the termination of his relationship with FedEx saying the company's 'move to cancel our contracts is a clear case of (it) silencing anyone with a voice.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vZ29sZi5jb20vbmV3cy9wZ2EtdG91ci1jYXJkcy1saXYtZ29sZi_SAS5odHRwczovL2dvbGYuY29tL25ld3MvcGdhLXRvdXItY2FyZHMtbGl2LWdvbGYv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These 6 pros are getting their PGA Tour cards and they have LIV Golf to thank,"These 6 pros are getting their PGA Tour cards and they have LIV Golf to thank

Cameron Smith's defection to LIV Golf means several pros get their PGA Tour cards back. Getty Images

Five weeks ago Justin Lower gave one of the most raw and candid interviews of the PGA Tour season.

The rookie three-putted the 72nd hole at the Wyndham Championship to fall outside the top 125 in the FedEx Cup standings and lose his PGA Tour card for the 2022-2023 season.

Fast forward to this week and even before the conclusion of the Korn Ferry Tour Finals Lower has his card for next season secured — and he has LIV Golf to thank for it.

The PGA Tour updated the FedExCup Playoffs and Eligibility Points List to remove six players: Cameron Smith Joaquin Niemann Marc Leishman Anirban Lahiri Harold Varner III and Cameron Tringale who were suspended Friday after teeing it up in LIV Golf’s Boston Invitational. Each player is playing his first event on the Saudi-backed PGA Tour rival circuit.

Because of the LIV golfers’ removal Lower along with Matt Wallace Austin Smotherman Doc Redman Danny Willett and Kelly Kraft all moved inside the top 125 of Eligibility Points List secured PGA Tour cards and will have full status next season.

Lower and Redman were playing in the Korn Ferry Tour Finals to try and regain their cards and both were inside the coveted top 25 of the finals points list before this week’s Korn Ferry Tour Championship. Neither teed it up at Victoria National.

Kraft was just outside the top 25 and did play in the Tour Championship but withdrew on Friday upon the suspensions of the LIV defectors after firing an opening round 68. All three players will be dropped from the Korn Ferry Finals as they cannot improve their standing on the eligibility list.

Additionally the PGA Tour announced players will be paid their FedEx Cup bonuses based on the updated Eligibility Points List and not the Official FedEx Cup Standings. Players suspended by the Tour who are no longer on the Eligibility List will receive bonuses based on the Official FedEx Cup Standings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uZmwvY29tbWFuZGVycy9uZXdzL3dhc2hpbmd0b24tamFja3NvbnZpbGxlLWphZ3VhcnMtd2Vlay1vbmUtZm9vdGJhbGwtaGlzdG9yeS1zZXJpZXMtdXBkYXRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,History Favors Washington Commanders Over Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 1,"The Washington Commanders season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars is history in the making.

Of course it's the first game for the Commanders under their new permanent moniker ... but they'll face a team the Washington franchise has had a ton of success against in the past.

The Commanders are 6-1 all-time against the Jags going into Sunday's season opener and have won the last four meetings. The only time the Jags beat the Commanders? The year was 2002. That game a 26-7 thumping against Washington took place in Jacksonville ... meaning the Jaguars are seeking their first-ever win at FedEx Field.

Given the fact the Jaguars began playing in the NFL in 1995 and intra-conference games take place once every four years there haven't been many opportunities for the two teams to face one another.

The last time the two teams played came in 2018. Josh Johnson was the quarterback Adrian Peterson was the starting running back and kicker Dustin Hopkins nailed a game-winning field goal as time expired to give Washington a 16-13 victory.

While history may favor the Commanders against the Jaguars 2022 is a brand new season and a lot has changed between the two teams since their last meeting. And with this being the season opener it only adds to the emphasis of this game being a clean slate for both teams as they trek on through the new season.

Kickoff between the two teams is scheduled for 1 p.m. Sunday.

It’s no secret that northern St. Johns County is experiencing a massive development boom right now.

Over the past decade thousands of single-family and multi-family living units have popped up throughout land that had long sat undeveloped near the county line between southern Duval and northern St. Johns. And with any significant growth in population commercial development soon follows.

Over half a dozen retail center projects have sprung up in the northern St. Johns area. The largest of these projects Durbin Park has been detailed frequently by local publications including our own. We even created a running list of future Durbin Park tenants which became one of our most-viewed articles of all time showing the clear interest in retail growth in the area.

That’s why we’ve decided to make a dedicated list for all of the other less-mentioned developments that are underway in the northern St. Johns area. We’ve listed what we know so far below and we’ll keep updating the list as new tenants and projects are announced.

The Indian economy has undergone a large structural shift in the last eight years and is currently the 5th largest economy in the world after overtaking the United Kingdom. Going ahead India is expected to pip Germany in 2027 and Japan by 2029 at the current rate of growth as per a State Bank of India SBI ) research report.The path taken by India since 2014 reveals India is likely to get the tag of 3rd largest economy in 2029 a movement of 7 places upwards since 2014 when India was ranked 10th according to a research report from the State Bank of India's Economic Research Department. India should surpass Germany in 2027 and most likely Japan by 2029 at the current rate of growth.This is a remarkable achievement by any standards said the report authored by Soumya Kanti Ghosh Group Chief Economic Adviser SBI.India a former British colony leapt past the UK in the final three months of 2021 to become the fifth-biggest economy. The calculation is based in US dollars and India extended its lead in the first quarter according to GDP figures from the International Monetary Fund.India's GDP growth in Q1 FY23 was 13.5 per cent. At this rate India is likely to be the fastest growing economy in the current fiscal. Interestingly even as estimates of India's GDP growth rate for FY23 currently range from 6.7 per cent to 7.7 per cent we firmly believe that it is immaterial. In a world that is ravaged by uncertainties we believe 6 per cent to 6.5 per cent growth is the new normal the report noted.The share of India's GDP is now at 3.5 per cent as against 2.6 per cent in 2014 and is likely to cross 4 per cent in 2027 the current share of Germany in global GDP.Broad-based growth of empowerment will also lift India's per capita income from current levels and this could also as a force multiplier for a better tomorrow.The Indian economy is forecast to grow more than 7% this year. A world-beating rebound in Indian stocks this quarter has just seen their weighting rise to the second spot in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index trailing only China’s.(With agency inputs)"

The company assured that the vehicle completed the operation without problems and is in good condition.

The drone has six electric motors that work on solar batteries can conduct maneuvers for a long time even at night and reach more than 20 kilometers of altitude.

Its design will allow it to be sent to carry out reconnaissance missions geographic mapping monitoring of forest fires and the atmosphere among other functions.

Observers indicate that it also broadens the path of research and development of new energies and aeronautical engineering.

[Photo by Liu Feng/chinadaily.com.cn]

Aviation Industry Corp of China the country's leading aircraft maker carried out on Saturday the maiden flight of what it calls the country's first large fully solar-powered drone the State-owned conglomerate said on Sunday.

The Qimingxing 50 or Morning Star 50 drone took off at 5:50 pm Saturday from an airport in Yulin of Shaanxi province and stayed in air for 26 minutes before landing on the same runway AVIC said in a news release adding that all systems on the unmanned plane functioned well.

Propelled by six electric motors powered by solar batteries the drone is designed to conduct long-time operations in near space according to the release.

Near space is that part of Earth's atmosphere at altitudes of 20 to 100 kilometers encompassing portions of the stratosphere mesosphere and lower thermosphere. It is above the top altitudes of commercial airliners but below orbiting satellites.

The drone is able to fly at altitudes of up to over 20 km and can stay airborne overnight. The solar panels are placed on the wings that have a combined length of 50 meters said Zhu Shengli head designer of Qimingxing 50.

Calling the model a ""quasi-satellite"" Zhu said it features high operational efficiency and eco-friendliness and will be tasked with high-altitude reconnaissance forestry fire monitoring atmospheric environmental inspection aerial mapping communication signal relay and other operations.

He said the solar-powered drone will also help to advance the research and development in fields such as new energy composite material and aeronautical engineering. It will improve the country's operational capability in near space and oceans the designer added.

Before AVIC the nation's two major space contractors — China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp and China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp — have developed and built solar-powered drone models capable of flying in near space.

Internationally a handful of countries like the United States and United Kingdom have developed solar-powered drones that can fly as high as 20000 meters.

The world record of the highest altitude reached by a solar-powered drone 29524 meters was made by the US' Helios Prototype developed by the technology company AeroVironmentInc in California in August 2001.

Wu Peixin an aviation industry observer in Beijing said there are no clouds at an altitude of 20000m or higher and the airflow there is stable so the drone can fully use its solar cells to generate power. As long as the solar power system works well the aircraft can stay in the air as long as the controllers wish.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzb2Zpc3JhZWwuY29tL2phbWVzLXdlYmItdGVsZXNjb3BlLWNhcHR1cmVzLWZpcnN0LWltYWdlLW9mLWEtcGxhbmV0LW91dHNpZGUtb3VyLXNvbGFyLXN5c3RlbS_SAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc29maXNyYWVsLmNvbS9qYW1lcy13ZWJiLXRlbGVzY29wZS1jYXB0dXJlcy1maXJzdC1pbWFnZS1vZi1hLXBsYW5ldC1vdXRzaWRlLW91ci1zb2xhci1zeXN0ZW0vYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,James Webb telescope captures first image of a planet outside our solar system,"The James Webb space telescope has taken its first image of an exoplanet — a planet outside our solar system — as astronomers hail the device’s performance since its launch last year.

Images from the most powerful space telescope ever built have thrilled observers in recent months as it orbits the sun a million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from Earth.

Its latest pioneering pictures show that the exoplanet called HIP 65426 b is a gas giant with no rocky surface and could not be habitable.

“This is a transformative moment not only for Webb but also for astronomy generally” said Sasha Hinkley astronomy professor at the University of Exeter who led the observation team.

Webb’s infrared gaze and coronagraphs — telescopic attachments that block out starlight — enable it to take direct images of exoplanets.

“It was really impressive how well the Webb coronagraphs worked to suppress the light of the host star” Hinkley said in a NASA statement on Thursday.

The HIP 65426 b exoplanet is six to 12 times the mass of Jupiter and young — about 15 to 20 million years old compared to the 4.5-billion-year-old Earth.

The telescope which only released its first images in July has already revealed dazzling new detail of the Phantom Galaxy and of the planet Jupiter.

The Hubble space telescope previously captured direct exoplanet images but in far less detail.

“I think what’s most exciting is that we’ve only just begun” said Aarynn Carter of the University of California. “We may even discover previously unknown planets.”

The $10-billion Webb telescope is a collaboration between NASA the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency.

On 13 May 1982 the south-facing plant supplied electricity to the grid for the first time. The installed output is ten kilowatts which was an extraordinary amount at the time.

The condition colour and output of the solar cells were regularly checked and measured. An examination after 35 years of operation concluded that the cells were showing wear. This included corrosion hot spots as well as cracks in the cells or defects in connection cables. But the majority of the modules still functioned well and still delivered at least 80 per cent of the output over all confirms Mauro Caccivio who heads the photovoltaic laboratory at the Supsi University of Applied Sciences in Ticino.

September 03 2022. By News Bureau

Sunnova Energy International Inc. announced it has applied to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to develop a first-of-its-kind solar and storage focused micro-utility in California.



Sunnova formed a wholly-owned subsidiary called Sunnova Community Microgrids California LLC (SCMC) to own and operate EaaS offerings in new communities including energy generation storage and distribution infrastructure. SCMC seeks to develop largely self-sustaining micro-utilities by equipping new home communities with solar and storage to provide consumers with a better energy service that allows them to live in a more resilient home and community with latest-generation energy infrastructure.



SCMC will focus on newly constructed homes allowing the company to work with developers to design and implement distributed solar-powered microgrids for communities that will benefit from improved sustainability and clean resilient and reliable power​. These communities will be known as Sunnova Adaptive Communities™.

“Community microgrids are the future as they offer the unique ability to share excess electricity putting the power in the hands of homeowners and significantly enhancing the resiliency of communities” said William J. (John) Berger founder and Chief Executive Officer of Sunnova.

“We believe microgrids address a strong need in the market for more robust energy solutions and better connectivity” added Berger. “The Sunnova Adaptive Community™ will provide consumers with the ability to produce share and deliver power when it’s needed most. SCMC’s application highlights the relief that the existing transmission and distribution system will experience given that most of the power that will be consumed by these communities will be generated locally from renewable resources. We hope the CPUC moves expeditiously to approve our application so that we can begin serving new communities.”"

German American Events which has hosted Christkindlmarkets in the Chicago area since 1996 brought the German-style outdoor holiday market to the Deer District outside Fiserv Forum in 2018 and 2019. The 2018 market was the first major outdoor event held in the plaza outside the then-new Bucks arena.

The COVID-19 pandemic shut down plans for the market in 2020; last year the organization said it had decided not to return to Milwaukee for the 2021 holiday season because it ""did not receive enough vendor interest"" to continue.

Last week the organization unveiled its three planned Christkindlmarket locations for 2022: in Daley Plaza in the heart of Chicago Gallagher Way in Chicago's Wrigleyville neighborhood in RiverEdge Park in Aurora the western Chicago suburb.

The latter is a new location for the Christkindlmarket; the Daley Plaza site is marking its 26th season while the Wrigleyville market will be in its fourth year. All three will open Nov. 18.

Christkindlmarket confirmed via email Thursday that it won't operate a Christmas market in Milwaukee in 2022.

That doesn't mean you won't hear sleigh bells outside Fiserv Forum this holiday season.

The Bucks are planning some holiday events of their own in the plaza outside the NBA arena.

The Milwaukee Business Journal first reported the Bucks' plans.

""Deer District will once again transform into Cheer District for the holidays and will feature activations from past years in addition to new family-friendly experiences that will be announced at a later date"" the Bucks said in a statement emailed to the Journal Sentinel Friday.

Recently my truck was stolen forcing me to get some new wheels. And for the first time in my life I’ve been looking to buy a new car. The process has involved hours of searching. Painful haggling. And encounters with many dealerships that quite frankly have been downright duplicitous. The whole thing has been kind of a nightmare.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

Cars are of course expensive especially with the supply chain fiasco creating shortages. But it's more than that. Shopping for cars is not like shopping for most other products. Unlike say computers or refrigerators cars are typically not sold for one standard price. Ten people could go into a dealership and each pay a wildly different amount to buy the same exact vehicle.

Economists call this sort of pricing strategy ""price discrimination."" That's when instead of charging everyone the same price sellers charge people different prices based on their willingness to pay. In simpler terms it means that the seller milks as much money as they can out of you. Not all dealerships engage in this pricing strategy but many do it aggressively often with snake oil-style salesmanship deceptive marketing tactics hidden fees and overpriced add-ons like floor mats alarm systems or anti-rust undercoating. Some consumers call the outfits that employ these tactics ""stealerships.""

The tricky pricing strategy used by dealerships can be maddening for consumers and I've personally found haggling over the price of a new truck with slick commission-seeking salespeople to be exhausting (Fortunately my partner has proved herself to be a talented haggler).

A slew of economic studies has found patterns in who bears the brunt of this pricing strategy. It's not pretty. For example a number of studies find that dealerships tend to charge people of color more than white folks. Another study finds that older people tend to be charged higher prices than younger people and that older women tend to be charged the highest price of all.

One study found that dealerships tend to treat a buyer's decision to trade in their used car like a neon sign on their foreheads flashing ""Charge me more!"" That's because trading in your used car while easier than selling it directly also fetches less money. Dealerships apparently see this as an indicator that you're either unsavvy or willing to burn cash — so they jack up the price of the car they sell to you. The type of car you trade in also offers a wealth of information on how much they can charge.

In normal times when supply is ample and dealerships are more worried about getting cars off the lot it's common for them to charge less than the Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price (MSRP). But with supply-chain problems creating shortages of new vehicles recently many dealerships have been charging much more than MSRP. Meanwhile the dealerships that don't add markups to MSRP are seeing their inventory depleted quickly and often have wait times of months or even years for coveted vehicles.

Michelle Krebs is a longtime automotive researcher who serves as the executive analyst of Cox Automotive which owns brands like Kelley Blue Book and Autotrader. ""This is the first time in my career — and it's a long career — that I've seen most dealerships charging at list price or over"" she says. ""And it's simply because there's high demand low inventory and they can do it."" Krebs says she's seen some cases where dealerships have charged buyers literally tens of thousands of dollars over MSRP.

Automakers vs. dealerships

Dealerships are usually independent franchises of their affiliated automaker which means they are autonomous businesses that can basically do what they want when it comes to setting prices. But many automakers are not happy with their franchises charging crazy high markups. A recent study from the consumer group Growth for Knowledge suggests that excessive price gouging sours consumers on not just a particular dealership but the car brand as a whole.

At least some automakers know this. Earlier this year Hyundai Motor Company sent a letter to its dealerships urging them to end deceptive practices such as advertising a low price online and then charging a much higher price when customers go into the store. The company complained that sky-high markups were ""damaging our brands' long-term ability to capture new customers and retain loyal ones.""

Likewise Ford Motor Company urged its dealers to cut down on markups and threatened to cut back on sending them Ford's most coveted vehicles if they didn't. And yet the new Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck and the Ford Bronco are some of the most marked-up vehicles on the market regularly being priced at much higher levels than what Ford has said they should be sold for. The problem for Ford: dealerships are independent and the Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price is just that suggested.

Newer automakers like Tesla and Rivian have been trying to build distribution and service networks that jettison the use of independent dealerships. They are building a direct-to-consumer retail model in which consumers custom-design their vehicles on the internet and receive them directly from the manufacturer — without dealership middlemen and exhausting haggling over price with commission-seeking salespeople. For in-person needs these automakers provide their own dealerships and service centers.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

However there are state franchise laws across the country that protect independent dealerships — and these laws have made it difficult to disrupt the dealership system and offer consumers potentially a better way of buying a vehicle.

A V8 political engine

To be fair to dealerships they do provide important services. They offer a distribution and service network which is vital to both manufacturers and car buyers. They offer buyers the ability to check out test drive and learn about cars at their facilities which really do cost a lot when it comes to real estate inventory and manpower. If the manufacturer recalls something there are thousands of local dealerships across the nation there to fix the problem. They also of course create tons of jobs in local communities.

But while having a sprawling network of local dealerships may be valuable this geographic reach also gives them outsized political power. Spread out all over the place local dealerships are important constituents for a whole slew of federal state and local politicians. That — together with the fact that they're a trillion-dollar-plus industry — makes them an effective lobbying force. And opponents argue that the protective franchise laws they've worked to erect and maintain thwart entrepreneurs' ability to create new more efficient business models that better serve consumers.

We reached out to the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) which represents more than 16000 dealerships across America and they provided a statement. ""State legislatures passed franchise laws — and continue to overwhelmingly support franchise laws — to separate car sales from manufacturing prevent monopoly pricing by factories promote competition in auto sales and service and keep jobs and investment local"" says NADA Vice President of Communications Jared Allen. ""The franchise system delivers these tremendous benefits better than anyone.""

Some of these claims — like the fact that local dealerships create jobs — are undeniable. Others are highly debatable. First of all there are more than a dozen automakers in the United States so no single carmaker comes close to being a monopoly. And it's not clear how adding a middleman to the process reduces prices for consumers especially when you consider that this middleman often resorts to a slew of tactics that tends to raise prices. Many of these dealerships by the way are not mom-and-pop shops; the industry is seeing growing consolidation with multibillion-dollar corporations now owning hundreds of dealerships across the nation.

For years the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) the agency tasked with looking out for American consumers has advocated relaxing state franchise laws so that companies like Tesla or Rivian can create new direct-to-consumer business models. ""States should allow consumers to choose not only the cars they buy but also how they buy them"" FTC officials wrote in 2015. But franchise laws continue to protect the dealership model and thwart innovation.

Earlier this summer the FTC proposed new rules aimed at combating the graft and skulduggery found at many dealerships. ""As auto prices surge the Commission is seeking to eliminate the tricks and traps that make it hard or impossible to comparison shop or leave consumers saddled with thousands of dollars in unwanted junk charges"" the FTC said.

The new rules the FTC proposes include a ban on deceptive advertising in which dealerships market cars as way cheaper than they actually intend to sell them for; a ban on ""junk fees for fraudulent add-on products and services that provide no benefit to the consumer""; and a requirement that dealerships disclose upfront all costs and conditions for buying their vehicles.

NADA not surprisingly opposes these proposed rules. ""The FTC's proposed rules would cause great harm to consumers by significantly extending transaction times making the customer experience much more complex and inefficient and increasing prices and NADA again urges the FTC to go back to the drawing board before forcing implementation of a series of unstudied and untested mandates that will have such significant negative impacts on customers"" says NADA Vice President of Communications Jared Allen.

Buying a car in this bonkers market

We asked Michelle Krebs the longtime automobile industry analyst if she had any advice for me — and more importantly you our cherished Planet Money newsletter readers — about buying a car in this bonkers supply-constrained market. ""I always say pack your patience and persistence"" Krebs says. ""You have to keep looking keep shopping. You have to be flexible on your choice. You may not get the brand or car style you want. And importantly expand your geographic search. Most people don't want to shop more than 25 miles away but you may need to go farther than that.""

In trying to find my new truck I spent hours searching online and corresponding with dozens of dealerships located up and down the West Coast and farther inland. I found some trucks that were literally priced $10000-$15000 over MSRP and I encountered many of the shady business practices that the FTC is now trying to ban. I also found honest ""no haggle"" dealerships willing to sell the truck at MSRP. The catch: I'd be forced to wait at least six months for a truck from them to arrive and with the theft of my old truck leaving me without a vehicle I didn't have that kind of patience.

Luckily my partner ended up finding the exact truck I wanted located more than 400 miles away in Southern California near her parents' house. The dealership initially wanted $5000 over MSRP. But thanks to her fierce negotiations (she's a lawyer) we were able to talk them down to only $2000 over. In normal times that would be a rip-off. But these are not normal times.

Anyways at least I have a truck again — and unlike the last one this one has an immobilizer that might prevent it from being stolen.

For the first time in history the North American International Auto Show will be hosted in the middle of September instead of cold snowy January.

And the Ford Piquette Plant Museum is adding to the mix with extended hours and a special event on the last day of the auto show.

On Sept. 25 the museum will celebrate the Model T's 114th birthday including rides in a Tin Lizzie a vintage car show shopping and museum tours.

Henry Ford’s iconic Model T — the car that put the world on wheels with its affordable price — shaped Detroit's history.

""At one point in the early 1920s every other car on the planet was a Model T"" said Jill Woodward president and chief operating officer of the Piquette Plant Museum. ""It was the car that really helped ... move people from horses and carriages to automobiles.""

On Oct. 1 1908 the first Model T was released. In the first month only 11 cars were made since the vehicle was assembled by hand using vanadium alloy steel wooden wheels and wooden lining. The first Model T vehicles each took approximately 23 hours and 8 minutes to build.

The Model T was one of the first vehicles to be a part of mass production. One of Henry Ford’s goals with the car was to create something affordable and practical for the everyday person to drive. It sparked conversation interest in manufacturing urban planning and transportation worldwide.

""That was the first car that was affordable for the everyday person"" Woodward said.

The first 12000 Model T's were made at the Henry Ford Plant in Detroit on Piquette in 1908 at 461 Piquette Ave. As interest grew Ford decided it was time for a new space something bigger and better.

In 1910 just two years after the Model T hit the market Ford opened the Highland Park Ford Plant at 91 Manchester Ave. It became the second production location for the highly sought-after ride and was the first factory to manufacture cars on a moving assembly line cutting production time to just 93 minutes.

Model T's were expected to reach a speed of about 40-45 mph. Today Woodward said drivers keep speeds closer to 35 mph because of the vehicle's age.

Ford made 15 million Model T's in total with about a quarter-million still in existence.

In the Ford Piquette Plant Museum guests learn the history of Ford Motor Co. with film photography antiques original artifacts and 60 rare Ford vehicles on exhibit.

""We tell the story (in) the museum about Henry Ford's famous saying 'You can have any color you want so long as it’s black' but the first novelties were actually carmine red"" Woodward said. ""The ones that were made here they started red and then they went to Brewster green and then there was a navy. It wasn't really until about 1914 that the Model T was made in all black and that was because they were in such high demand everywhere all over the world.""

Woodward also said that once Ford started using the color black he was able to create more vehicles because the paint dried faster and it was the cheapest.

The museum is located in the Detroit Milwaukee Junction neighborhood and draws 30000 visitors annually. The museum will be open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day of the Detroit auto show which runs Sept. 17-25.

Typically the museum is open Wednesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. year-round. Tickets for adults are $17 students and youth tickets are $10 and children under the age of 4 can get in free.

On the day of the birthday celebration the line for the free Model T car rides will start on the west side of the building with the last ride departing at 4 p.m.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvYnJvbmNvLWZldmVyLXRha2VzLWhvbGQtbm8tdmFjY2luZS1wbGFubmVkLTE5NzczNC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bronco Fever Takes Hold No Vaccine Planned,"Ford showed a great deal of moxie bringing back the popular Bronco last year. The move to bring back the Bronco in its early 70's retro variant was bolder still. Consumers have responded: Bronco sales from August 2021 were up 268% from the same month a year ago.

What's more is consumers are spending big bucks at dealers on Ford Motor Company-backed accessories. From light kits and tube doors to camping tents and kayak carriers outdoor folks are scooping up accessories to the tune of an average of $1700 per vehicle.Accessories for the Bronco have been a significant boon for dealers with their high margins and no lack of supply. While some accessories are OEM many come from other manufacturers such as Yakima roof racks and Warn winches.Steve Olliges owner of Team Ford in Las Vegas told Auto News that he is having such huge success in selling Broncos and accompanying accessories that he believes he could make a living selling only Broncos ad trimmings. His dealership has sold over 700 Broncos since its revival a little more than a year ago. His customers normally spend $4000-$5000 to outfit their off-road toys.Business is so brisk that Olliges is investing $10 million to build a 9000 square-foot (836 square meters) Bronco Barn near his Vegas showroom with plans to build a Bronco-specific showroom next door.Ford states that consumers have purchased over 1 million accessories for their Broncos and other dealers have echoed the success of Team Ford. The company added the Bronco is the company's most accessorized model with a choice of about 240 products with the Bronco Sport leading the way. Buyers of the Bronco Sport spend an average of $800 on accessories equaling the money spent on best-selling F-Series pickups.The most popular products are modular front bumpers winches and off-road lights.The success of the accessory program can be attributed to lessons learned from the failure of a similar program centered around the 2018 Ford Ranger that was plagued with distribution problems and lack of sufficient inventory.You can bet any retro-Bronco you see is not showroom-direct but modified to fit the desires of the person at the wheel."

There are two separate Korn Ferry Tour finals points lists:

one which decides the top 25 in Korn Ferry Tour Finals earnings for players ranked 26th through 75th in the Korn Ferry Tour regular season and Nos. 126-200 in the PGA Tour's regular season FedEx Cup points list as well others who qualified for the Korn Ferry Tour finals through medical extensions or non-member FedEx Cup points one which decides the initial PGA Tour priority order for the top 25 players on the Korn Ferry Tour regular season points

The winners of both of those points lists are fully exempt for the season ahead and get a spot in The Players Championship. Justin Suh won the list of Korn Fetty Tour grads and Will Gordon won the Korn Ferry Tour Finals points list so they are the only players NOT subject to the reshuffles in the PGA Tour priority order every six or so events. He is in his own priority order category for the season ahead of the other graduates. Every other player is subject to the reshuffle.

When it comes to determining the priority order in which they get into PGA Tour events the PGA Tour goes in A-B order with the No. 2 earning Korn Ferry Tour regular season graduate getting top spot in that category followed by the No. 2 earning Korn Ferry Tour Finals gradate and so on.

The University of Nevada Reno and Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation gathered more than 200 milkweed leaf samples from retail nurseries across 15 states and tested them for pesticides. Their findings were published this week in the journal Biological Conservation.

Milkweed is the primary food source for caterpillars and adult monarchs use it as a breeding ground.

""Milkweed is really important to the monarch butterfly. All butterflies have specific host plants that they depend on. The milkweed happens to be the host plant for monarch butterflies"" explained study coauthor Matt Forister professor of biology at the University of Nevada Reno.

Over the last few decades the western monarch butterfly population has dropped from the millions recorded in the 1980s to as low as 1800. One of the biggest threats to the butterflies is the loss of breeding habitat throughout the U.S. which is why conservationists recommend people plant native milkweed in their gardens.

""We wanted to understand the pesticides that are used in and around and on milkweed in nursery production"" explained Aimee Code pesticide program director at the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation. ""That's why we kind of went across the country and bought milkweed plants from retailers to better understand what kind of chemicals we might find on those plants and on the day of purchase what are we going to see.""

MONARCH BUTTERFLIES ARE NOW LISTED AS ENDANGERED

The study's lead author Christopher Halsch explained that pesticides are broken down into herbicides fungicides and insecticides.

""Generally these things being on leaves … almost certainly not with the intention of going after the monarch but they can end up on leaves and then a caterpillar that happens to have its egg laid there ends up on this leaf"" Halsch said. ""And you have compounds that are designed to in some cases literally attack caterpillars in other cases go after fungus which has been shown to have negative impacts on the physiology of caterpillars.""

Over 60 pesticides were found during the study with as many as 28 chemicals on one plant. Only nine of those chemicals have been tested to understand the impacts on monarchs; the impacts of the others are generally unknown. Halsch said additional studies are needed to know the full effect of all the chemical compounds found on nursery plants.

""I was surprised we saw as strong that signal as we did as we know almost nothing about compounds. And of the ones we do we found some harmful concentrations"" Halsch said. ""When you are finding 12 compounds per leaf on average and most of those are unknown.

Halsch said more information about the compounds can have a meaningful effect on understanding how they impact wild caterpillars which are not usually their targets.

The survey included large retailers and small local nurseries.

""A single location store was just as likely to contain something harmful as a large corporation you purchase from"" Halsch said.

What can a home gardener do to avoid harmful chemicals?

Experts said that although this news might be frustrating to home gardeners looking to help pollinators there are steps that can be taken to reduce chemicals in those regardless of where the milkweed is purchased.

The problem of pesticides is not just about monarchs but is a concern for many insects. Home gardeners can make things worse by spraying other pesticides in their yards when it may not be necessary and ultimately more harmful. Code recommends researching the problem before using chemicals or contacting a local extension office for help.

Also be aware of unregulated claims on plant labels.

""Don't assume that ‘pollinator-friendly’ or ‘valuable to wildlife’ means anything. It's not related to pesticide use"" Code said. ""It means that's a plant that would attract them.""

Researchers with the study found plants in nurseries with these ""wildlife-friendly"" labels had just as many chemicals as those without.

Wherever a gardener turns for help Forister said they should ask about non-chemical options for their garden.

""Use this as a reminder to not be adding more toxins to your garden"" Forister said.

HOPE FLOATS: WESTERN MONARCH BUTTERFLY COUNT YIELDS HIGHEST TOTAL IN 5 YEARS

Forister said additional research is needed to determine if there are more steps an individual can take when they bring home milkweed purchased from a nursery such as removing the plant from the soil it came in or washing the leaves.

A recent population survey this winter found a monarch butterfly population increase. Still experts warn that is not a sign they are on the rebound.

""It's like a stock. You can have a stock that's bouncing around and going down over time but you're still going to have a couple of good years"" Forister sid. ""So the Monarchs have had a couple of good years and that's fine. There are many other butterflies in North America that have not had a couple of good years and are also on downward trajectories.""

The study's authors stressed it is crucial to keep pollinating gardens growing along with taking steps to reduce pesticides to be part of the solution.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5weW1udHMuY29tL2NwaS1wb3N0cy9taXN1c2Utb2YtbWFya2V0LXBvd2VyLWluLWF1c3RyYWxpYS1lYXJseS1hc3Nlc3NtZW50LW9mLXRoZS1hbWVuZGVkLXNlY3Rpb24tNDYtb2YtdGhlLWNvbXBldGl0aW9uLWFuZC1jb25zdW1lci1hY3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Misuse of Market Power in Australia: Early Assessment of the Amended Section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act,"By Mel Marquis & Rhonda Smith1

I. Introduction

In the nearly 50-year saga of modern Australian competition law the section relating to the misuse of market power has recently been substantially revised. The revisions include removal of the requirement to establish a nexus between substantial market power and the alleged anti-competitive conduct and the introduction of an effects test as an alternative to proving and anti-competitive purpose. Significant uncertainty now looms large in this area of the law and authoritative judicial interpretations are needed so that businesses can better gauge how far the most recent amendments in 2017 have augmented the legal risks that shape their conduct.

Our early assessment is that there seems to be cause for concern. Unless future jurisprudence proves us wrong it appears that the former defects in Section 46 (“s.46”) of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (“CCA”) (i.e. the prohibition against “misuse of market power”) that provoked the 2017 amendments were less troubling than the new problems caused by those revisions. Whereas the previous form of the prohibition was criticized by some for allowing false acquittals as the price of avoiding false convictions the scales may now have been tipped too far to the other side. In this paper we explain why we are cautiously pessimistic.

Section II discusses the former version of s.46 of the CCA. Section III recalls the impact of the so-called Harper review which led to a complete re-write of s.46 in 2017. Section IV tentatively assesses how the 2017 reform may affect outcomes and comments on what appears to be a new period of uncertainty that may dampen investment and desirable competitive conduct.

II. The Vintage Section 46

After a false dawn for competition law in Australia in 1906 and another in 1965 a modern competition statute with meaningful prohibitions was finally adopted in 1974.2 Since then s.46(1) has been revised periodically most recently in 2017. The pre-2017 version provided:

A corporation that has a substantial degree of power in a market shall not take advantage of that power in that or any other market for the purpose of:

eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor of the corporation … preventing the entry of a person into that or any other market; or deterring or preventing a person from engaging in competitive conduct in that or any other market.



Two features are worth highlighting. First the phrase ‘shall not take advantage of that power’ was understood to require a causal link between the firm’s market power and the impugned behavior.3 The requirement of the causal link was relaxed when the High Court suggested that it would suffice to show that market power “materially facilitated” the conduct at issue.4 Yet it remained the case that no contravention was established if the factor that enabled the conduct was not a defendant’s market power but rather its financial power or “material and organisational assets.”5

Second while the above “proscribed purposes” may be relevant to the issue of foreclosure the provision appears to neglect the interests of consumers other than an oblique reference in s.46(c). Later judgments had to clarify that exclusionary conduct only contravenes s.46 if the foreclosure is meaningful to the “competitive process” that is to say if it would serve to weaken competitive constraints or keep competitive pressure at bay.6 Consumer interests are thus protected indirectly. Nevertheless the wording of s.46 may have overemphasized the “proscribed purposes” and the impact on particular competitors.7 In the 2003 Boral case where the High Court rejected allegations of predatory pricing Chief Justice Gleeson and Justice Callinan felt obliged to warn that it was “dangerous to proceed too quickly from a finding about purpose to a conclusion about taking advantage of market power. Indeed in such a case a process of reasoning that commences with a finding of purpose of eliminating or damaging a competitor and then draws the inference that a firm with the objective must have and be exercising a substantial degree of power in a market is expected to be flawed.”

The High Court also offered the following observations with regard to the “take advantage” element: “[I]f the impugned conduct has a business rationale that is a factor pointing against any finding that conduct constitutes a taking advantage of market power. If a firm with no substantial degree of market power would engage in certain conduct as a matter of commercial judgment it would ordinarily follow that a firm with market power which engages in the same conduct is not taking advantage of that power.” The latter statement became a basic litmus test with courts focusing on counterfactual market comparisons and where relevant whether the firm had already implemented a practice prior to acquiring substantial market power.8 However uncertainty emerged again when some cases used the phrase could engage instead of would engage or combined or conflated the two9 which may have further restricted the scope of application of s.46.10 Considering the confusion caused by would versus could11 the Australian Parliament in 2008 clarified that the operative word was would thus removing any doubt as to the implicit condition that the hypothetical benchmark firm active on this imagined market should be assumed to be a rational profit-maximiser. The relevant provision added at that time s.46(6A)(c) became moot in 2017 when the legal test for misuse of market power was overhauled.

It is worth noting briefly that both prior to 2017 and still today some forms of potentially exclusionary behavior can also trigger the prohibition against exclusive dealing (including tying conditions).12 At least in unusual circumstances a firm that does not have a substantial degree of market power could still cause a substantial lessening of competition in particular if the market is at the crease between competitive conditions and overly rigid barriers due to a thicket of vertical contracts.13

There was little doubt that the pre-2017 requirement of a causal link between market power and alleged misconduct played a significant role in the formative s.46 jurisprudence though it was softened somewhat by the above-mentioned Section 46(6A).14 Having remodeled s.46 the Parliament has unambiguously deleted that requirement.

III. The Harper Review and the 2017 Reconstruction of Section 46

The “root and branch” expert review of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 i.e. the Harper Review15 drew much attention. With regard to s.46 and controversially16 the expert panel endorsed a near-total recast of the prohibition. The revised formulation which survived vigorous lobbying by big business17 and was ultimately enshrined in the Act in November 2017 reads in pertinent part:

A corporation that has a substantial degree of power in a market must not engage in conduct that has the purpose or has or is likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in (a) that market; or (b) any other market in which that corporation or a body corporate that is related to that corporation: [supplies or acquires goods or services or is likely to do so].18

Gone are two trademark elements of the old version of this provision: the “take advantage” test and with it the requirement of a causal link between the firm’s market power and the allegedly unlawful conduct; and the need to match the conduct with one of the “proscribed purposes.” While the amendment is a striking departure from the previous version of Section 46 the “substantial lessening of competition” standard had already long been embedded within the other provisions of the Act governing mergers exclusive dealing and (non-cartel) restrictive agreements.

IV. The Effect of the Changes to Section 46: An Early Assessment

It has been nearly five years since the revised s.46 came into force yet the effect of these changes remains uncertain. Only one matter — TasPorts19 — has reached the court and it is of limited precedential value as it was not fully litigated. In this case Engage Marine (“Engage”) won a contract to provide towage and pilotage services to Grange Resources (“Grange”) at Port Latta in Northwest Tasmania; the contract had previously been held by the incumbent TasPorts. After Grange notified TasPorts that it was going to switch to Engage TasPorts imposed a new port access charge on Grange potentially making use of Engage’s services uneconomic. The ACCC alleged that the incumbent’s conduct prevented Engage from servicing the contract and expanding its operations in the relevant market. TasPorts imposed new charges on Engage’s tugboats thus making it uneconomic for Engage to use TasPorts’ temporary berths while failing to provide long term berths as well. This forced Engage to deploy a temporary offshore mooring outside of another port and prevented deployment of the second tug required under its Grange contract. TasPorts also failed or refused to provide marine pilot training to Engage. As TasPorts admitted these breaches the Federal Court did not adopt a fully considered decision but issued a Declaration giving effect to those admissions on May 5 2021. Under the circumstances this matter provides no insights as to how the Australian courts will interpret the revised s.46.

The lack of a fully litigated case is particularly significant given the nature of the CCA. Compared to statutes such as the Sherman Antitrust Act 189020 which identifies two general forms of conduct and relies on judges to give them meaning the Australian CCA is far more prescriptive. However the revised s.46 is an exception: the provision is now more open-textured and somewhat ambiguous. What is clear as explained above is that s.46 can only apply if a firm possesses substantial market power. The conduct must then be shown to have the purpose and/or effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition. A firm with substantial market power is entitled to defend its market position from aggressive competitors by adding value — improving its product and/or reducing its costs — but not by engaging in exclusionary conduct that harms the competitive process.

As we have also seen under the revised s.46 it is no longer necessary to show that the conduct involves the use (i.e. the “taking advantage”) of the firm’s market power. This is significant because previously whether a firm had taken advantage of its market power was generally assessed by whether the relevant conduct would be economically rational absent the firm’s market power.21 For example a firm with substantial market power might refuse to supply because it would facilitate competition but would not refuse if the market were competitive and the buyer could obtain supply elsewhere. However if the supplier was concerned about the buyer’s creditworthiness or concerned about the buyer producing low quality products which would tarnish the supplier’s reputation it would presumably refuse supply even in a competitive market. In the latter circumstance there would have been no contravention under the “old” s.46.

Removal of the “take advantage” requirement from s.46 means that differentiating between anti-competitive conduct and possibly aggressive “competition on the merits” now falls to the substantial lessening of competition test. As Kemp points out the provision “does not expressly permit the dominant firm to raise an efficiency defence or justification for its conduct.”22 Under the old s.46 conduct that did no more than increase efficiency would likely have been pursued by a firm in a competitive market and it would not have been a taking advantage of market power. That same line of reasoning does not mesh easily with s.46 in its current form.23 Nevertheless as Kemp24 and Williams25 have argued increased efficiency — productive allocative and dynamic — fuels competition. Consequently if conduct is being assessed to determine whether it substantially lessens competition the extent to which it increases efficiency should be a relevant consideration. On the other hand it is not yet clear how demanding Australian courts will be with regard to efficiency claims under s.46 following the 2017 reform.26

One of the problems with the substantial lessening of competition test that has been highlighted by the concerns about the effectiveness of the mergers provision of the CCA (s.50) is the requirement of evidence regarding the effect of future conduct which satisfies the Evidence Act 1995. In the context of unilateral conduct the challenged practice in some cases may already have occurred and sufficient time may have elapsed to identify its effect. Frequently however this will not be the case: sufficient time will not have passed before the conduct ceases in response to an inquiry by the ACCC and/or because there is the potential for litigation.

Enforcement of competition law involves trade-offs between the risk that pro-competitive conduct will mistakenly be found anticompetitive (Type I error) and the risk that anticompetitive behavior will mistakenly be found not to be so (Type II error). Traditionally the view has been that Type I errors have more adverse effects than Type II errors and so (all else being equal) the priority should be to minimize Type I errors.27 The amendments to s.46 tend toward the opposite view. They broaden the catchment for finding a misuse of market power. Is the provision now too broad? Will it over-reach? In part this depends on the effectiveness of the substantial lessening of competition test in distinguishing pro-competitive conduct from anticompetitive conduct as noted above. However leaving that to one side it also depends on the wording of the section. Consider the following example. Assume that a company with substantial market power seeks to increase its purchases of a necessary input to meet increased demand for its product. It enters into contracts with suppliers including some that supply its competitors. Consequently some competitors may no longer be able to acquire sufficient inputs to continue to operate or they may be uncompetitive because they face increased input costs. Under the old s.46 it might be argued that the company is simply seeking to produce more and maximize its profits: it has not used its market power to engage in exclusionary conduct and it has no anticompetitive purpose. Under the revised s.46 the outcome is less clear. Irrespective of its purpose if the effect of the conduct is to foreclose existing competitors (and likely raise entry barriers) it may well contravene s.46. Such a scenario illustrates a degree of uncertainty for business following the 2017 reform. Much will depend on how the ACCC and ultimately the courts consider that s.46 should be applied.

One way of testing the effect of the changes to s.46 is to assess whether cases that were unsuccessful under the former s.46 would be likely to succeed under the revised s.46. In Rural Press28 the ACCC was successful in proving that a non-compete agreement between two publishers of local subscription newspapers in South Australia would substantially lessen competition in contravention of s.45 the prohibition of anticompetitive agreements. However it was unsuccessful in establishing that a threat by one of the publishers to enter the other’s territory with a free newspaper would contravene s.46 even though fear that this would occur at the least contributed to entry into the non-compete agreement. The reasoning of the High Court on appeal in relation to the failure under s.46 was that Rural Press could engage in such a threat even in a competitive market that is it did not need market power to do so. With respect perhaps the relevant question was whether Rural Press would have achieved its objective by its threat and whether the conduct would have been profitable had the market been competitive. Under the revised s.46 to succeed in its claim the ACCC would need to establish that the purpose of the threat was to force Waikerie Printing into the non-compete agreement and/or that the threat had that effect which in turn as established in relation to s.45 had the effect of substantially lessening competition.

Pegg carries out a similar assessment in relation to Cement Australia.29 In that case the ACCC was successful in establishing that Cement Australia had engaged in conduct that substantially lessened competition under s.45. The trial judge found that:

[T]he scope of the rights provision was included for a substantial purpose of preventing or discouraging a rival from obtaining access to Tarong and Tarong North raw flyash for processing … and to prevent a rival entering the SEQ [South East Queensland] concrete grade flyash market with processed Tarong or Tarong North flyash. Thus a substantial purpose of the formulation and inclusion of [the relevant clauses] was a substantial purpose of substantially lessening competition in each market.30

However the ACCC was unsuccessful in its claim that the conduct — entering into contracts to purchase more flyash than it reasonably required — was a misuse of market power intended to prevent or deter competition. Pegg sums up the trial judge’s findings as follows:

While Cement Australia had a substantial degree of power within the cement market and the conduct undertaken by Cement Australia was for the prescribed purposes of locking out competitors the conduct did not involve Cement Australia taking advantage of their market power… [because] a firm sans market power could have entered into these agreements and therefore… [His Honour] did not conclude that Cement Australia had taken advantage of its market power.31

As in Rural Press arguably the problem is the way in which the counterfactual is expressed. Leaving that aside considering the court’s finding that the effect of the contracts was to substantially lessen competition contrary to s.45 it seems likely that if there had been no “take advantage” criterion under s.46 at that time Cement Australia’s conduct would have breached the latter provision as well.32

A survey by Gilbert & Tobin (2021) of applications and settlements since November 2017 when the revisions to s.46 took effect suggests that the reform may have encouraged private litigation.33 They found that “over the last 18 months while no final judgments have been made there have been interim remedies ordered (injunctions against both Facebook and Google) and evidence of at least two commercial settlements.”34 However various problems still face private litigants particularly as “[p]rivate litigation almost always turns ultimately on price.”35 Past experience indicates that courts are not well equipped to make orders concerning pricing given the complexity of arriving at an effective form of injunctive relief in this context.36 As the authors conclude: “for private litigants the attractiveness of section 46 as a legal claim will depend to a substantial degree on whether Courts can develop a set of remedies that adequately respond to anti-competitive pricing practices.”37

V. Conclusion

In this paper we have questioned whether the perceived flaws in the drafting of the “old” abuse of dominance provision in Australia have been overcorrected resulting in a perverse “cure” for an exaggerated disease. If the Australian courts do nothing to allay these concerns in particular by interpreting the reformulated s.46 in a supple way that allows for socially beneficial aggressive competition even where it has incidental foreclosure effects yet another redesign may be required. As noted above the public authority has brought only one case so far under the revised s.46 and the matter was not litigated but rather was resolved through judicial approval of an admission of contravention and penalty. The future approach of the Courts in this area of the law thus remains unknown.

3 This contrasts with Article 102 TFEU for example in respect of which there is no formal need to show that an imaginary non-dominant firm would not have engaged in the same conduct. See Case 6-72 Europemballage and Continental Can v. Commission EU:C:1973:22 para 27. On the other hand it is likely (in an exclusionary conduct case) that there must be a logical link between the dominant position and the harm i.e. between the dominant position and effect of the conduct on an otherwise “effective competition structure.” See Ekaterina Rousseva Rethinking Exclusionary Abuses in EU Competition Law (Hart 2010) 73-79; Renato Nazzini The Foundations of European Union Competition Law and the Objectives and Principles of Article 102 (OUP 2011) 176-178. In other words the (seldom articulated) issue is not on whether a hypothetical non-dominant firm would have engaged in the conduct but whether the same conduct by a non-dominant firm would have had the same anti-competitive effect.

12 Given the partial overlap between the scope of s.46 and that of s.47 claims of misuse of market power have commonly been accompanied by parallel allegations of unlawful exclusive dealing under s.47. See e.g. ACCC v. Safeway Stores (No 2) (2003) 119 FCR 339; ACCC v. Baxter Healthcare (2008) 170 FCR 16; ACCC v. Pfizer Australia [2018] FCAFC 78.

14 Opinions differed regarding the extent to which s.46(6A) broadened the scope of the “take advantage” test. See Luke Woodward & Matt Rubinstein The use and abuse of section 46 (2016) p.10 https://cdn.brandfolder.io/3RTTK3BV/as/pev81q-9t241k-dovisy/Luke_Woodward-Theuseandmisuseofsection46.pdf. Commenting on the Cement Australia and Pfizer cases the authors emphasize the impact of s.46(6A) stating for example with regard to Pfizer that the Federal Court “did not immunise conduct on the basis that a firm without market power could or would have engaged in similar conduct.”

15 See Harper et al. supra note 13.

23 Prior to November 2017 authorization that is an exemption granted on the basis that the conduct would result in a net public benefit was not available for behavior constituting a misuse of market power. As this mechanism is now available for s.46 conduct efficiency gains could at least in theory justify such an authorization (provided the conduct has not yet been implemented). However since an application for authorization amounts to an invitation to the regulator by a firm with substantial market power to test claims that the ‘public benefit’ would outweigh the ‘public detriment’ such applications might prove rare. The incentive to apply may be particularly weak if a firm fears its submission would later be turned against it as an admission of substantial market power. See Kemp supra note 10 at 180.

Tata Sky commenced operations in 2004 as an 80:20 joint venture between Tata Sons and Network Digital Distribution Services FZ-LLC (NDDS) an entity owned by Rupert Murdoch’s 21 Century Fox. Disney acquired Fox in 2019. Disney owns another 9.8% stake in Tata Sky through TS Investments Ltd where Fox owned 49% stake with Tata owning the rest. In FY08 Baytree Investments (Mauritius) Pte Ltd (Bay Tree) an affiliate of Temasek acquired a 10% stake in Tata Sky while in FY13 Tata Opportunities Fund and Tata Capital Ltd acquired an equity stake in the company. Tata Sons has a 41.49% stake in the company.

Mint first reported in August 2021 that the company was planning to go public.

“Work on the IPO had started last year but was put on the back burner for a while as the company undertook a rebranding exercise and the markets too started to look difficult in the early part of the calendar year. However work on the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) was restarted recently and efforts are in full swing to file the DRHP by end of this month"" said the first person cited above.

In January the Tata group rebranded Tata Sky as Tata Play to reflect its business interests growing beyond Direct To Home services and aid further diversification into allied businesses such as OTT and broadband.

In a press statement announcing the rebranding Harit Nagpal managing director and chief executive of Tata Play Ltd said “Tata Sky leveraged its market leadership in its core business to create an ecosystem of content delivery by foraying into OTT and Broadband. We believe it is time for a brand identity that resonates beyond our DTH business.""

The proposed IPO will see investors Temasek and Tata Capital sell part of their stakes in the company while the company also plans to raise money for its use.

“Temasek and Tata Capital have been invested in the company for a long time. So they are looking to dilute their holdings. The final quantum of the secondary stake sales is still under discussion. The company will also raise primary capital to invest in growing its businesses in areas beyond DTH especially broadband"" said the second person cited above.

The IPO size is expected to be in the range of $300-400 million he added.

Tata Play reported a slight increase in its revenue from operations in FY22 to Rs4741 crore from a revenue of Rs4682 crore in FY21. Profits however remained flat at Rs68.6 crore in FY22 compared to profit of Rs68.75 in the previous fiscal.

Tata Play is the biggest DTH service provider in the company with a 33.23% market share. Overall DTH subscribers in the country stood at 66.9 million at the end of 31 March as per data from Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.

Emails sent to Tata Play on Friday did not elicit a response.

The consulting firm MWPVL says that the online retail giant is either closing or abandoning plans to open 42 facilities across the country totaling almost 25 million square feet of usable space Bloomberg reported.

The firm says that Amazon has also delayed opening 21 other locations and canceled several European projects mostly in Spain.

""Amazon is a dynamic business and we are constantly exploring new locations"" Amazon spokesperson Maria Boschetti told Fox News Digital. ""We weigh a variety of factors when deciding where to develop future sites to best serve customers.

The report comes after it was announced the company is closing two delivery stations in Maryland that employ more than 300 people.

Amazon posted its slowest growth rate in more than 20 years in July but ultimately posted better results than expected which caused the stock to jump 12% the New York Times reported.

""Despite continued inflationary pressures in fuel energy and transportation costs we’re making progress on the more controllable costs we referenced last quarter particularly improving the productivity of our fulfillment network"" Andy Jassy Amazon’s chief executive said in a statement at the time.

The University of Nevada Reno and Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation gathered more than 200 milkweed leaf samples from retail nurseries across 15 states and tested them for pesticides. Their findings were published this week in the journal Biological Conservation.

Milkweed is the primary food source for caterpillars and adult monarchs use it as a breeding ground.

""Milkweed is really important to the monarch butterfly. All butterflies have specific host plants that they depend on. The milkweed happens to be the host plant for monarch butterflies"" explained study coauthor Matt Forister professor of biology at the University of Nevada Reno.

Over the last few decades the western monarch butterfly population has dropped from the millions recorded in the 1980s to as low as 1800. One of the biggest threats to the butterflies is the loss of breeding habitat throughout the U.S. which is why conservationists recommend people plant native milkweed in their gardens.

""We wanted to understand the pesticides that are used in and around and on milkweed in nursery production"" explained Aimee Code pesticide program director at the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation. ""That's why we kind of went across the country and bought milkweed plants from retailers to better understand what kind of chemicals we might find on those plants and on the day of purchase what are we going to see.""

MONARCH BUTTERFLIES ARE NOW LISTED AS ENDANGERED

The study's lead author Christopher Halsch explained that pesticides are broken down into herbicides fungicides and insecticides.

""Generally these things being on leaves … almost certainly not with the intention of going after the monarch but they can end up on leaves and then a caterpillar that happens to have its egg laid there ends up on this leaf"" Halsch said. ""And you have compounds that are designed to in some cases literally attack caterpillars in other cases go after fungus which has been shown to have negative impacts on the physiology of caterpillars.""

Over 60 pesticides were found during the study with as many as 28 chemicals on one plant. Only nine of those chemicals have been tested to understand the impacts on monarchs; the impacts of the others are generally unknown. Halsch said additional studies are needed to know the full effect of all the chemical compounds found on nursery plants.

""I was surprised we saw as strong that signal as we did as we know almost nothing about compounds. And of the ones we do we found some harmful concentrations"" Halsch said. ""When you are finding 12 compounds per leaf on average and most of those are unknown.

Halsch said more information about the compounds can have a meaningful effect on understanding how they impact wild caterpillars which are not usually their targets.

The survey included large retailers and small local nurseries.

""A single location store was just as likely to contain something harmful as a large corporation you purchase from"" Halsch said.

What can a home gardener do to avoid harmful chemicals?

Experts said that although this news might be frustrating to home gardeners looking to help pollinators there are steps that can be taken to reduce chemicals in those regardless of where the milkweed is purchased.

The problem of pesticides is not just about monarchs but is a concern for many insects. Home gardeners can make things worse by spraying other pesticides in their yards when it may not be necessary and ultimately more harmful. Code recommends researching the problem before using chemicals or contacting a local extension office for help.

Also be aware of unregulated claims on plant labels.

""Don't assume that ‘pollinator-friendly’ or ‘valuable to wildlife’ means anything. It's not related to pesticide use"" Code said. ""It means that's a plant that would attract them.""

Researchers with the study found plants in nurseries with these ""wildlife-friendly"" labels had just as many chemicals as those without.

Wherever a gardener turns for help Forister said they should ask about non-chemical options for their garden.

""Use this as a reminder to not be adding more toxins to your garden"" Forister said.

HOPE FLOATS: WESTERN MONARCH BUTTERFLY COUNT YIELDS HIGHEST TOTAL IN 5 YEARS

Forister said additional research is needed to determine if there are more steps an individual can take when they bring home milkweed purchased from a nursery such as removing the plant from the soil it came in or washing the leaves.

A recent population survey this winter found a monarch butterfly population increase. Still experts warn that is not a sign they are on the rebound.

""It's like a stock. You can have a stock that's bouncing around and going down over time but you're still going to have a couple of good years"" Forister sid. ""So the Monarchs have had a couple of good years and that's fine. There are many other butterflies in North America that have not had a couple of good years and are also on downward trajectories.""

The study's authors stressed it is crucial to keep pollinating gardens growing along with taking steps to reduce pesticides to be part of the solution.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5weW1udHMuY29tL2NwaS1wb3N0cy9taXN1c2Utb2YtbWFya2V0LXBvd2VyLWluLWF1c3RyYWxpYS1lYXJseS1hc3Nlc3NtZW50LW9mLXRoZS1hbWVuZGVkLXNlY3Rpb24tNDYtb2YtdGhlLWNvbXBldGl0aW9uLWFuZC1jb25zdW1lci1hY3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Misuse of Market Power in Australia: Early Assessment of the Amended Section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act,"By Mel Marquis & Rhonda Smith1

I. Introduction

In the nearly 50-year saga of modern Australian competition law the section relating to the misuse of market power has recently been substantially revised. The revisions include removal of the requirement to establish a nexus between substantial market power and the alleged anti-competitive conduct and the introduction of an effects test as an alternative to proving and anti-competitive purpose. Significant uncertainty now looms large in this area of the law and authoritative judicial interpretations are needed so that businesses can better gauge how far the most recent amendments in 2017 have augmented the legal risks that shape their conduct.

Our early assessment is that there seems to be cause for concern. Unless future jurisprudence proves us wrong it appears that the former defects in Section 46 (“s.46”) of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (“CCA”) (i.e. the prohibition against “misuse of market power”) that provoked the 2017 amendments were less troubling than the new problems caused by those revisions. Whereas the previous form of the prohibition was criticized by some for allowing false acquittals as the price of avoiding false convictions the scales may now have been tipped too far to the other side. In this paper we explain why we are cautiously pessimistic.

Section II discusses the former version of s.46 of the CCA. Section III recalls the impact of the so-called Harper review which led to a complete re-write of s.46 in 2017. Section IV tentatively assesses how the 2017 reform may affect outcomes and comments on what appears to be a new period of uncertainty that may dampen investment and desirable competitive conduct.

II. The Vintage Section 46

After a false dawn for competition law in Australia in 1906 and another in 1965 a modern competition statute with meaningful prohibitions was finally adopted in 1974.2 Since then s.46(1) has been revised periodically most recently in 2017. The pre-2017 version provided:

A corporation that has a substantial degree of power in a market shall not take advantage of that power in that or any other market for the purpose of:

eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor of the corporation … preventing the entry of a person into that or any other market; or deterring or preventing a person from engaging in competitive conduct in that or any other market.



Two features are worth highlighting. First the phrase ‘shall not take advantage of that power’ was understood to require a causal link between the firm’s market power and the impugned behavior.3 The requirement of the causal link was relaxed when the High Court suggested that it would suffice to show that market power “materially facilitated” the conduct at issue.4 Yet it remained the case that no contravention was established if the factor that enabled the conduct was not a defendant’s market power but rather its financial power or “material and organisational assets.”5

Second while the above “proscribed purposes” may be relevant to the issue of foreclosure the provision appears to neglect the interests of consumers other than an oblique reference in s.46(c). Later judgments had to clarify that exclusionary conduct only contravenes s.46 if the foreclosure is meaningful to the “competitive process” that is to say if it would serve to weaken competitive constraints or keep competitive pressure at bay.6 Consumer interests are thus protected indirectly. Nevertheless the wording of s.46 may have overemphasized the “proscribed purposes” and the impact on particular competitors.7 In the 2003 Boral case where the High Court rejected allegations of predatory pricing Chief Justice Gleeson and Justice Callinan felt obliged to warn that it was “dangerous to proceed too quickly from a finding about purpose to a conclusion about taking advantage of market power. Indeed in such a case a process of reasoning that commences with a finding of purpose of eliminating or damaging a competitor and then draws the inference that a firm with the objective must have and be exercising a substantial degree of power in a market is expected to be flawed.”

The High Court also offered the following observations with regard to the “take advantage” element: “[I]f the impugned conduct has a business rationale that is a factor pointing against any finding that conduct constitutes a taking advantage of market power. If a firm with no substantial degree of market power would engage in certain conduct as a matter of commercial judgment it would ordinarily follow that a firm with market power which engages in the same conduct is not taking advantage of that power.” The latter statement became a basic litmus test with courts focusing on counterfactual market comparisons and where relevant whether the firm had already implemented a practice prior to acquiring substantial market power.8 However uncertainty emerged again when some cases used the phrase could engage instead of would engage or combined or conflated the two9 which may have further restricted the scope of application of s.46.10 Considering the confusion caused by would versus could11 the Australian Parliament in 2008 clarified that the operative word was would thus removing any doubt as to the implicit condition that the hypothetical benchmark firm active on this imagined market should be assumed to be a rational profit-maximiser. The relevant provision added at that time s.46(6A)(c) became moot in 2017 when the legal test for misuse of market power was overhauled.

It is worth noting briefly that both prior to 2017 and still today some forms of potentially exclusionary behavior can also trigger the prohibition against exclusive dealing (including tying conditions).12 At least in unusual circumstances a firm that does not have a substantial degree of market power could still cause a substantial lessening of competition in particular if the market is at the crease between competitive conditions and overly rigid barriers due to a thicket of vertical contracts.13

There was little doubt that the pre-2017 requirement of a causal link between market power and alleged misconduct played a significant role in the formative s.46 jurisprudence though it was softened somewhat by the above-mentioned Section 46(6A).14 Having remodeled s.46 the Parliament has unambiguously deleted that requirement.

III. The Harper Review and the 2017 Reconstruction of Section 46

The “root and branch” expert review of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 i.e. the Harper Review15 drew much attention. With regard to s.46 and controversially16 the expert panel endorsed a near-total recast of the prohibition. The revised formulation which survived vigorous lobbying by big business17 and was ultimately enshrined in the Act in November 2017 reads in pertinent part:

A corporation that has a substantial degree of power in a market must not engage in conduct that has the purpose or has or is likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in (a) that market; or (b) any other market in which that corporation or a body corporate that is related to that corporation: [supplies or acquires goods or services or is likely to do so].18

Gone are two trademark elements of the old version of this provision: the “take advantage” test and with it the requirement of a causal link between the firm’s market power and the allegedly unlawful conduct; and the need to match the conduct with one of the “proscribed purposes.” While the amendment is a striking departure from the previous version of Section 46 the “substantial lessening of competition” standard had already long been embedded within the other provisions of the Act governing mergers exclusive dealing and (non-cartel) restrictive agreements.

IV. The Effect of the Changes to Section 46: An Early Assessment

It has been nearly five years since the revised s.46 came into force yet the effect of these changes remains uncertain. Only one matter — TasPorts19 — has reached the court and it is of limited precedential value as it was not fully litigated. In this case Engage Marine (“Engage”) won a contract to provide towage and pilotage services to Grange Resources (“Grange”) at Port Latta in Northwest Tasmania; the contract had previously been held by the incumbent TasPorts. After Grange notified TasPorts that it was going to switch to Engage TasPorts imposed a new port access charge on Grange potentially making use of Engage’s services uneconomic. The ACCC alleged that the incumbent’s conduct prevented Engage from servicing the contract and expanding its operations in the relevant market. TasPorts imposed new charges on Engage’s tugboats thus making it uneconomic for Engage to use TasPorts’ temporary berths while failing to provide long term berths as well. This forced Engage to deploy a temporary offshore mooring outside of another port and prevented deployment of the second tug required under its Grange contract. TasPorts also failed or refused to provide marine pilot training to Engage. As TasPorts admitted these breaches the Federal Court did not adopt a fully considered decision but issued a Declaration giving effect to those admissions on May 5 2021. Under the circumstances this matter provides no insights as to how the Australian courts will interpret the revised s.46.

The lack of a fully litigated case is particularly significant given the nature of the CCA. Compared to statutes such as the Sherman Antitrust Act 189020 which identifies two general forms of conduct and relies on judges to give them meaning the Australian CCA is far more prescriptive. However the revised s.46 is an exception: the provision is now more open-textured and somewhat ambiguous. What is clear as explained above is that s.46 can only apply if a firm possesses substantial market power. The conduct must then be shown to have the purpose and/or effect or likely effect of substantially lessening competition. A firm with substantial market power is entitled to defend its market position from aggressive competitors by adding value — improving its product and/or reducing its costs — but not by engaging in exclusionary conduct that harms the competitive process.

As we have also seen under the revised s.46 it is no longer necessary to show that the conduct involves the use (i.e. the “taking advantage”) of the firm’s market power. This is significant because previously whether a firm had taken advantage of its market power was generally assessed by whether the relevant conduct would be economically rational absent the firm’s market power.21 For example a firm with substantial market power might refuse to supply because it would facilitate competition but would not refuse if the market were competitive and the buyer could obtain supply elsewhere. However if the supplier was concerned about the buyer’s creditworthiness or concerned about the buyer producing low quality products which would tarnish the supplier’s reputation it would presumably refuse supply even in a competitive market. In the latter circumstance there would have been no contravention under the “old” s.46.

Removal of the “take advantage” requirement from s.46 means that differentiating between anti-competitive conduct and possibly aggressive “competition on the merits” now falls to the substantial lessening of competition test. As Kemp points out the provision “does not expressly permit the dominant firm to raise an efficiency defence or justification for its conduct.”22 Under the old s.46 conduct that did no more than increase efficiency would likely have been pursued by a firm in a competitive market and it would not have been a taking advantage of market power. That same line of reasoning does not mesh easily with s.46 in its current form.23 Nevertheless as Kemp24 and Williams25 have argued increased efficiency — productive allocative and dynamic — fuels competition. Consequently if conduct is being assessed to determine whether it substantially lessens competition the extent to which it increases efficiency should be a relevant consideration. On the other hand it is not yet clear how demanding Australian courts will be with regard to efficiency claims under s.46 following the 2017 reform.26

One of the problems with the substantial lessening of competition test that has been highlighted by the concerns about the effectiveness of the mergers provision of the CCA (s.50) is the requirement of evidence regarding the effect of future conduct which satisfies the Evidence Act 1995. In the context of unilateral conduct the challenged practice in some cases may already have occurred and sufficient time may have elapsed to identify its effect. Frequently however this will not be the case: sufficient time will not have passed before the conduct ceases in response to an inquiry by the ACCC and/or because there is the potential for litigation.

Enforcement of competition law involves trade-offs between the risk that pro-competitive conduct will mistakenly be found anticompetitive (Type I error) and the risk that anticompetitive behavior will mistakenly be found not to be so (Type II error). Traditionally the view has been that Type I errors have more adverse effects than Type II errors and so (all else being equal) the priority should be to minimize Type I errors.27 The amendments to s.46 tend toward the opposite view. They broaden the catchment for finding a misuse of market power. Is the provision now too broad? Will it over-reach? In part this depends on the effectiveness of the substantial lessening of competition test in distinguishing pro-competitive conduct from anticompetitive conduct as noted above. However leaving that to one side it also depends on the wording of the section. Consider the following example. Assume that a company with substantial market power seeks to increase its purchases of a necessary input to meet increased demand for its product. It enters into contracts with suppliers including some that supply its competitors. Consequently some competitors may no longer be able to acquire sufficient inputs to continue to operate or they may be uncompetitive because they face increased input costs. Under the old s.46 it might be argued that the company is simply seeking to produce more and maximize its profits: it has not used its market power to engage in exclusionary conduct and it has no anticompetitive purpose. Under the revised s.46 the outcome is less clear. Irrespective of its purpose if the effect of the conduct is to foreclose existing competitors (and likely raise entry barriers) it may well contravene s.46. Such a scenario illustrates a degree of uncertainty for business following the 2017 reform. Much will depend on how the ACCC and ultimately the courts consider that s.46 should be applied.

One way of testing the effect of the changes to s.46 is to assess whether cases that were unsuccessful under the former s.46 would be likely to succeed under the revised s.46. In Rural Press28 the ACCC was successful in proving that a non-compete agreement between two publishers of local subscription newspapers in South Australia would substantially lessen competition in contravention of s.45 the prohibition of anticompetitive agreements. However it was unsuccessful in establishing that a threat by one of the publishers to enter the other’s territory with a free newspaper would contravene s.46 even though fear that this would occur at the least contributed to entry into the non-compete agreement. The reasoning of the High Court on appeal in relation to the failure under s.46 was that Rural Press could engage in such a threat even in a competitive market that is it did not need market power to do so. With respect perhaps the relevant question was whether Rural Press would have achieved its objective by its threat and whether the conduct would have been profitable had the market been competitive. Under the revised s.46 to succeed in its claim the ACCC would need to establish that the purpose of the threat was to force Waikerie Printing into the non-compete agreement and/or that the threat had that effect which in turn as established in relation to s.45 had the effect of substantially lessening competition.

Pegg carries out a similar assessment in relation to Cement Australia.29 In that case the ACCC was successful in establishing that Cement Australia had engaged in conduct that substantially lessened competition under s.45. The trial judge found that:

[T]he scope of the rights provision was included for a substantial purpose of preventing or discouraging a rival from obtaining access to Tarong and Tarong North raw flyash for processing … and to prevent a rival entering the SEQ [South East Queensland] concrete grade flyash market with processed Tarong or Tarong North flyash. Thus a substantial purpose of the formulation and inclusion of [the relevant clauses] was a substantial purpose of substantially lessening competition in each market.30

However the ACCC was unsuccessful in its claim that the conduct — entering into contracts to purchase more flyash than it reasonably required — was a misuse of market power intended to prevent or deter competition. Pegg sums up the trial judge’s findings as follows:

While Cement Australia had a substantial degree of power within the cement market and the conduct undertaken by Cement Australia was for the prescribed purposes of locking out competitors the conduct did not involve Cement Australia taking advantage of their market power… [because] a firm sans market power could have entered into these agreements and therefore… [His Honour] did not conclude that Cement Australia had taken advantage of its market power.31

As in Rural Press arguably the problem is the way in which the counterfactual is expressed. Leaving that aside considering the court’s finding that the effect of the contracts was to substantially lessen competition contrary to s.45 it seems likely that if there had been no “take advantage” criterion under s.46 at that time Cement Australia’s conduct would have breached the latter provision as well.32

A survey by Gilbert & Tobin (2021) of applications and settlements since November 2017 when the revisions to s.46 took effect suggests that the reform may have encouraged private litigation.33 They found that “over the last 18 months while no final judgments have been made there have been interim remedies ordered (injunctions against both Facebook and Google) and evidence of at least two commercial settlements.”34 However various problems still face private litigants particularly as “[p]rivate litigation almost always turns ultimately on price.”35 Past experience indicates that courts are not well equipped to make orders concerning pricing given the complexity of arriving at an effective form of injunctive relief in this context.36 As the authors conclude: “for private litigants the attractiveness of section 46 as a legal claim will depend to a substantial degree on whether Courts can develop a set of remedies that adequately respond to anti-competitive pricing practices.”37

V. Conclusion

In this paper we have questioned whether the perceived flaws in the drafting of the “old” abuse of dominance provision in Australia have been overcorrected resulting in a perverse “cure” for an exaggerated disease. If the Australian courts do nothing to allay these concerns in particular by interpreting the reformulated s.46 in a supple way that allows for socially beneficial aggressive competition even where it has incidental foreclosure effects yet another redesign may be required. As noted above the public authority has brought only one case so far under the revised s.46 and the matter was not litigated but rather was resolved through judicial approval of an admission of contravention and penalty. The future approach of the Courts in this area of the law thus remains unknown.

3 This contrasts with Article 102 TFEU for example in respect of which there is no formal need to show that an imaginary non-dominant firm would not have engaged in the same conduct. See Case 6-72 Europemballage and Continental Can v. Commission EU:C:1973:22 para 27. On the other hand it is likely (in an exclusionary conduct case) that there must be a logical link between the dominant position and the harm i.e. between the dominant position and effect of the conduct on an otherwise “effective competition structure.” See Ekaterina Rousseva Rethinking Exclusionary Abuses in EU Competition Law (Hart 2010) 73-79; Renato Nazzini The Foundations of European Union Competition Law and the Objectives and Principles of Article 102 (OUP 2011) 176-178. In other words the (seldom articulated) issue is not on whether a hypothetical non-dominant firm would have engaged in the conduct but whether the same conduct by a non-dominant firm would have had the same anti-competitive effect.

6 The role of this notion of the “competitive process” is well illustrated in the opposite but consistent outcomes reached in two cases from the 1980s Outboard Marine v. Hecar Investments (No 6) [1982] FCA 265 and Mark Lyons v. Bursill Sportsgear (1987) 74 ALR 581.

7 Cf. Allan Fels The Australian Controversy over Abuse of Market Power Law in Reconciling Efficiency and Equity: A Global Challenge for Competition Policy 197 208 (Damien Gerard & Ioannis Lianos eds. 2019) (“While it is true that the High Court has imposed an underlying competition test into s. 46 the fact is that in one case after another it was obvious that judges liked to look very carefully at whether the behaviour breached conditions (a) (b) and (c) in s. 46(1) (those are the provisions that refer to damage to competitors) […].”).

8 To dispel doubts the High Court had to clarify that the relevant counterfactual did not call for the heroic assumption of a perfectly competitive market but only a (workably competitive) market where no firm has substantial market power. See Melway supra note 4 paragraph 52.

9 See Arlen Duke The Need to Close the “Take Advantage” Gap in the Regulation of Unilateral Anti-Competitive Conduct 15 Comp. & Consumer Law J. 284 292 (2008).

10 For detailed discussion of the uncertainty arising from the ‘old’ s.46 and its application in case law see Katharine Kemp Misuse of Market Power: Rationale and Reform (2018) for example at 148-153.

11 This confusion and its significance have however been downplayed. See Caroline Coops A Fly in the Ointment for the ACCC? Implications of the Cement Australia decision for the interpretation of section 46 23 Aust. J. Comp. & Consumer Law 83 (2015).

12 Given the partial overlap between the scope of s.46 and that of s.47 claims of misuse of market power have commonly been accompanied by parallel allegations of unlawful exclusive dealing under s.47. See e.g. ACCC v. Safeway Stores (No 2) (2003) 119 FCR 339; ACCC v. Baxter Healthcare (2008) 170 FCR 16; ACCC v. Pfizer Australia [2018] FCAFC 78.

13 Contra the arguably overbroad opinion expressed in Ian Harper et al. Competition Policy Review: Final Report 375 (2015) (“It is well accepted that vertical restrictions will not substantially lessen competition unless they are imposed by a corporation with substantial market power.”).

14 Opinions differed regarding the extent to which s.46(6A) broadened the scope of the “take advantage” test. See Luke Woodward & Matt Rubinstein The use and abuse of section 46 (2016) p.10 https://cdn.brandfolder.io/3RTTK3BV/as/pev81q-9t241k-dovisy/Luke_Woodward-Theuseandmisuseofsection46.pdf. Commenting on the Cement Australia and Pfizer cases the authors emphasize the impact of s.46(6A) stating for example with regard to Pfizer that the Federal Court “did not immunise conduct on the basis that a firm without market power could or would have engaged in similar conduct.”

15 See Harper et al. supra note 13.

16 See e.g. Woodward & Rubinstein supra note 14 (reforming s.46 amounted to fixing a provision that was not broken or at least was not broken following the addition of interpretive guidance in s.46(6A)).

22 Kemp supra note 10 at 170.

23 Prior to November 2017 authorization that is an exemption granted on the basis that the conduct would result in a net public benefit was not available for behavior constituting a misuse of market power. As this mechanism is now available for s.46 conduct efficiency gains could at least in theory justify such an authorization (provided the conduct has not yet been implemented). However since an application for authorization amounts to an invitation to the regulator by a firm with substantial market power to test claims that the ‘public benefit’ would outweigh the ‘public detriment’ such applications might prove rare. The incentive to apply may be particularly weak if a firm fears its submission would later be turned against it as an admission of substantial market power. See Kemp supra note 10 at 180.

Tata Sky commenced operations in 2004 as an 80:20 joint venture between Tata Sons and Network Digital Distribution Services FZ-LLC (NDDS) an entity owned by Rupert Murdoch’s 21 Century Fox. Disney acquired Fox in 2019. Disney owns another 9.8% stake in Tata Sky through TS Investments Ltd where Fox owned 49% stake with Tata owning the rest. In FY08 Baytree Investments (Mauritius) Pte Ltd (Bay Tree) an affiliate of Temasek acquired a 10% stake in Tata Sky while in FY13 Tata Opportunities Fund and Tata Capital Ltd acquired an equity stake in the company. Tata Sons has a 41.49% stake in the company.

Mint first reported in August 2021 that the company was planning to go public.

“Work on the IPO had started last year but was put on the back burner for a while as the company undertook a rebranding exercise and the markets too started to look difficult in the early part of the calendar year. However work on the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) was restarted recently and efforts are in full swing to file the DRHP by end of this month"" said the first person cited above.

In January the Tata group rebranded Tata Sky as Tata Play to reflect its business interests growing beyond Direct To Home services and aid further diversification into allied businesses such as OTT and broadband.

In a press statement announcing the rebranding Harit Nagpal managing director and chief executive of Tata Play Ltd said “Tata Sky leveraged its market leadership in its core business to create an ecosystem of content delivery by foraying into OTT and Broadband. We believe it is time for a brand identity that resonates beyond our DTH business.""

The proposed IPO will see investors Temasek and Tata Capital sell part of their stakes in the company while the company also plans to raise money for its use.

“Temasek and Tata Capital have been invested in the company for a long time. So they are looking to dilute their holdings. The final quantum of the secondary stake sales is still under discussion. The company will also raise primary capital to invest in growing its businesses in areas beyond DTH especially broadband"" said the second person cited above.

The IPO size is expected to be in the range of $300-400 million he added.

Tata Play reported a slight increase in its revenue from operations in FY22 to Rs4741 crore from a revenue of Rs4682 crore in FY21. Profits however remained flat at Rs68.6 crore in FY22 compared to profit of Rs68.75 in the previous fiscal.

Tata Play is the biggest DTH service provider in the company with a 33.23% market share. Overall DTH subscribers in the country stood at 66.9 million at the end of 31 March as per data from Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.

Emails sent to Tata Play on Friday did not elicit a response.

The segregated portfolios holding Vodafone Idea NCDs have received interest from the telecom company pushing up their NAVs by almost 20% on Friday. Side pockets of five schemes hold Vodafone Idea NCDs worth about Rs 1200 crore. These bonds are maturing in September 2023 but give out the annual accrued interest.Till six months ago these segregated portfolios were valued at zero as per Sebi rules. But in March the values were revised from zero to 35% following “a series of positive developments around Vodafone Idea Ltd”. The segregated portfolios were assigned NAVs on 2 March which in turn showed the value in individual portfolios of investors.In the six months since 2 March the segregated portfolios rose smartly 5.84%. On Friday after Rs 148.74 crore interest flowed in the NAVs of the side pockets shot up 20%. The fund house will distribute the amount received among investors by extinguishing proportionate units based on the NAV of 2 September (for units held in physical mode) and 9 September (for units held in demat mode).Given that the portfolios are valued at 35% there is still a lot of upside remaining. If all goes well and Vodafone Idea pays the principle and interest when the bonds mature in September 2023 investors holding these portfolios can expect their holdings to be worth around 180% of their current value.While the developments around Vodafone Idea bonds have made investors sigh in relief there is no update on the other side pockets that hold Yes Bank additional tier-1 bonds. Mutual funds together have some Rs 3400 crore invested in these bonds including Nippon Mutual Fund (Rs 2500 crore) Franklin Templeton (Rs 590 crore) UTI Mutual Fund (Rs 370 crore) and Kotak Mutual Fund (Rs 130 crore).,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbHRpbW9yZXN1bi5jb20vMjAyMi8wOS8wNC9kbGEtcGlwZXItbW92ZS1jb250aW51ZXMtbmVnbGVjdC1vZi1jZW50cmFsLWJ1c2luZXNzLWRpc3RyaWN0LXJlYWRlci1jb21tZW50YXJ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DLA Piper move continues neglect of central business district | READER COMMENTARY,"The Baltimore Sun reported the news that the DLA Piper law firm is moving to Harbor East after a 20-year escape to the suburbs. However what The Sun did not say is that the firm is jumping over the central business district like so many other recent companies have done including: Constellation Energy Legg Mason (now Franklin Templeton) T. Rowe Price Transamerica Ernst & Young Gordon Feinblatt and Saul Ewing. To say that DLA Piper is moving back “downtown” ignores the reality that the large business community has abandoned our city in fact and in spirit (“DLA Piper will relocate Baltimore office back downtown after two decades” Aug. 29).

Most of downtown’s “biggies” completely shut down their offices for two years to allow their employees to work from home while the small businesses that were dependent on them for survival were forced to close or sharply reduce their business. It has been a case of the haves and the have-nots. The biggies did not care. There was a time now long past when Baltimore corporate leaders were our city’s boosters. Through everything that Baltimore has endured — the relentless violence the obsession with (but lack of action regarding) the squeegee kids (entirely at the expense of small downtown businesses) the loss of jobs the decimation of the central business district the closing of small businesses the continuous population decline uncompetitive real estate tax rates (while favored big developers and large companies are beneficiaries of huge special tax breaks at the expense of residents and small businesses) there has been utter and complete silence from our business and civic leaders.

You cannot name the leader of any large company or nonprofit organization who has spoken publicly to raise the concerns that are on everybody’s mind. They are either afraid to do so or they do not care. They simply stand by while our city is dying. Doing nothing and saying nothing. It is tragic. It is morally reprehensible.

Can you tell us about this?

Piyush Gupta: Flexicap as a category allows fund managers to take allocation across different market capitalisation. So there is no restriction in terms of portfolio construction. Now having said that the funds still have a bias or higher allocation towards large caps when you look at this category as a whole.

Now talking about these two particular funds we have seen that HDFC Flexi Cap has seen improvement in the ranking and has gone up from rank three to rank one. Largely the improvement in the ranking has been driven by improvement in the performance. The fund has improved its ranking from two to one in the performance parameter.

While the portfolio-based parameters are still weaker for this fund it is concentrated at company and industry level.

Given the size of the fund the HDFC Flexi Cap Fund also ranks lower on the liquidity parameters. Coming to the performance this particular fund has actually delivered the highest return when we look at different time frames up to one year–three months six months nine months one year.

There is highest performance that this particular fund has given within the peer set.

Key drivers for the performance of this fund have been largely the stocks in the PSU segment. These stocks have actually done well in the recent quarter and relatively recent period which has meant that the performance of the fund has gone up during this period.

And these stocks largely belong to sectors like power energy auto and again dominated by PSU stocks which are actually helping it in improving its performance.

At a sector level the fund had lower allocation to I.T. or software which was a weaker performing sector during this period. That has also helped in protecting sort of a downside in the fund.

Coming to Axis we have seen that over a period of time there is a decline in performance of this particular fund or equity funds within the AMC across categories.

When we look at this fund it has slipped from rank three to rank five at an overall level as well as the performance parameter levels.

By design the fund has maintained higher concentration both at the company and at the sector level over a period of time.

What we have seen is that both sector allocation and stock selection has been adverse from the performance perspective which has meant that the fund has seen decline in its performance.

What we also see in this particular fund and Axis funds in general tend to have higher cash allocation. So despite having higher cash allocation in the recent quarter when the markets actually corrected the fund was not able to protect the downside.

So basically the adverse stock selection and sector allocation has contributed to its decline in its performance.",,,,,,

Then there are numerous other budget smartwatches filling up the demand. But what if I tell you there is a smartwatch that does more than what the mainstream products offer is built better and will probably be the last smartwatch you would own for a long time? It's the Garmin Fenix 7X Sapphire Solar.

Personally I'm not a fan of smartwatches I mean have had my share of smartwatches right from LG G Watch W100 back in the day to Samsung Fitbit and Apple. But I would rather prefer my trusty Casio GShock when it comes to travel or extreme activities. However when I heard about Garmin watches being available in India I was looking forward to trying them out because their products looked tough and brought ample tech along with them. So friendly folks at Garmin India were kind enough to send their flagship Fenix 7X Sapphire Solar to me for a couple of weeks.

TLDR;

It is amazing it can track almost any activity accurately while displaying everything on the screen the battery almost never dies it's super-premium it's expensive and probably will raise your expectations to unbeatable levels. The Fenix 7X is probably the best smartwatch you can buy right now provided you know what you want. That's because the Fenix 7X has too many features and it will overwhelm you if you are just looking to read notifications count steps and maybe listen to music. However if you are into sports adventure running and working out then the Fenix 7X will be your perfect companion. Lastly it's expensive however it offers a lot of things to justify the price tag of INR 98990

Garmin Fenix 7X

Design

The Garmin Fenix 7X is big with a 51mm case and that's a good thing because you get a larger display area at 1.4-inches. It features six physical buttons a touch screen covered with a Power Sapphire lens and a LED light. The review unit sent to us was the FENIX 7X Sapphire Solar One of the flagships from the Fenix range. The Fenix 7X is built with premium materials and one can immediately feel it. The lens (Crystal) is Power Sapphire which actually contains power cells and offers scratch resistance. The display also works with gloves and polarized sunglasses typically used in high sunlight areas like snow and mountaineering. The case of the watch is a fiber-reinforced polymer that keeps the weight low bezel though is made of Titanium. Between the bezel and the display runs the solar charging strip.

The buttons are very tactile and offer good feedback we did test the Fenix 7X on our Sunday bike rides and the touchscreen worked flawlessly with riding gloves on. The 1.4-inch display is a transreflective MIP display the power sapphire lens makes it a bit dimmer however it is clearly visible in direct sunlight and thanks to the backlit display it's clear at night as well. While some Garmin watches now feature OLED displays I really liked this MIP display it's easy on the battery and sharp. The visibility with polarized glasses is also another neat feature.

Garmin Fenix 7X

The Straps on the Fenix 7X are made of silicone feels like some high-quality silicone though. The 26mm straps are Quickfit watch band compatible which is Garmin's proprietary tech. While some people might not like this I feel that with such an expensive device a proprietory strap of the same quality standards and secure fit is what the target audience would want.

Garmin Fenix 7X - Red and White Flashlight

We mentioned there is a Flashlight on the top side of the watch when you are wearing the Fenix 7X on your wrist the LED is pointing outwards. The flashlight offers white light and red light and can be used as a flashlight or also for morse code. It can also be synced to a cadence sensor for aiding runners to stay visible to others in low light areas.

Built like a Tank

The Fenix 7X is built like a tank and you don't need to baby it even though you might want to looking at the price tag. However the super tough build quality means you can just focus on your thing be it running swimming hiking or anything and the Fenix 7X will keep up without any problem. The Fenix 7X is rated at 10 ATM of water resistance which means it is resistant to up to 100 meters of depth. I did manage to take Fenix 7X out to the sea on a recent vacation and faced absolutely no problems whatsoever. Moreover while traveling the lightweight yet super tough build quality is reassuring. Hiking on some trails the Fenix 7X started buzzing with 'Storm Alert' flashing on the screen and an hour or so later it started pouring and we got drenched. The Second time the 'Storm Alert' flashed on the screen was during the return flight probably because of the pressure changes the watch was sensing. This time though I took a picture.

Features

Cycling running hiking and swimming the Fenix 7X took everything with ease. Even gymming now Garmin Connect app offers a lot of data capturing ability and it takes a good amount of time to go through all the things inside the app. It also offers training guidance the accurate and continuous heartbeat and SPo2 measurement displayed on the screen is a godsend if you are into HIIT or strength training. The app also shows your 'Stress levels' which equates to how tired is your body and then there 'Body battery' which shows how much rest your body needs. The app offers in-depth sleep analysis as well this is one of the features I could not test as I have a habit of sleeping without a watch or a fitness tracker.

Garmin Connect App

The Garmin connect app also offers multiple watch faces and mind you these faces show a lot of information from the inbuilt sensors hence some of them are paid. The usual step counter and calorie counter are all there. There is also an option to download apps for music and other features some of which are paid. The Garmin Connect app is so vast that it probably needs a separate article to explain all the features. Notifications when connected to an Android device were very prompt with a little nudge of the strong vibration motor. You can also reply to messages using pre-set messages which worked fine. The Garmin Connect app is so vast that it probably needs a separate article to explain all the features.

The Fenix 7X does not have a rotating bezel to move through the menus and watch UI everything is operated through the buttons. It took a short while to get used to and then it was much easier as the buttons are quite intuitive to use. Moreover fewer moving parts means less probability of failure.

Battery life

Battery life has been stellar in my usage without using the GPS I could easily get 20-25 days of usage however GPS usage reduced the battery life by half. And if you are out in the sun most of the time the solar charging keeps topping up the battery extending the battery life.

Final thoughts

Garmin Fenix 7X is a PRO-grade watch. The tank-like build premium materials accurate telemetry data logging capability features like Body battery in-depth sleep analysis and more make the Fenix 7X quite a unique smartwatch. It is obviously not for everyone however it does change your perspective of what an ideal smartwatch should be like. If you are serious about sports and adventure make sure you try out the Fenix 7X It's expensive at INR 98990 however it offers a lot and can easily last for years. If you want something cheaper you could look at the Fenix 6 Pro Instinct Solar or the Forerunner 955 from Garmin itself because there are few alternatives from the competition.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnl1Z2F0ZWNoLmNvbS9uZXdzL2dhcm1pbi12ZW51LXNxLTItYW5kLXZlbnUtc3EtMi1tdXNpYy1lZGl0aW9uLW5vdy1vZmZpY2lhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garmin Venu Sq 2 and Venu Sq 2 Music Edition now official » YugaTech | Philippines Tech News & Reviews,"Garmin adds two new smartwatches to its Venu Series – Venu Sq 2 and Venu Sq 2 Music Edition.

WXIX reports David Caroll was eligible for parole this year but a parole board decided against his release.

Sixteen years ago David and Liz Carroll were foster parents to Marcus Fiesel a child living with autism.

According to authorities the Carrolls wrapped Marcus in a blanket put tape around him and left him in a closet where temperatures reached over 100 degrees in August 2006. The boy was without food or water.

Clermont County Prosecutor Mark Tekulve said Liz Carroll admitted they left the 3-year-old in the closet. They attended a family reunion in Kentucky and Marcus was dead when they returned home 30 hours later.

Instead of calling the police Tekulve said they covered the boy’s body with clothes and put him in a large box. David Carroll and his live-in girlfriend Amy Baker drove to an abandoned chimney in Brown County where David Carroll lit the box on fire.

The Clermont County prosecutor said David Carroll collected the child’s remains and threw them in the Ohio River before faking the boy’s disappearance.

Officials said David Carroll pleaded guilty to murder and gross abuse of a corpse in 2007. He was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison.

On Friday the Ohio Parole Board said David Carroll has not demonstrated adequate institutional conduct and lacks insight into criminal thinking errors and risk factors.

The board also said there is reason to believe David Carroll would engage in further criminal conduct if he were granted parole and noted there was significant community opposition against his release.

Among those who urged against parole being granted was Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters.

“I still cannot imagine how two people could do something like this. This sweet boy suffered a brutal death he died alone locked in a closet by the very people who were supposed to protect him” Deters said. “Now David Carroll is asking the parole board to show compassion. Monsters like him should never get out of prison.”

“Probably the most calm gentlest Australian shepherds you’ve ever met” said Tabitha Autele the owner of the dogs.

Autele told KHNL/KGMB that her dogs Bindi and Dutch loved going to their ranch.

“They saw the truck come home from work and they knew they were going to the ranch” Autele said. “They happily jumped in the truck. That was their happy place and our happy place. But since this has happened there’s no joy anymore.”

Autele and her husband Elmer Acera said their pups chased a mongoose onto a neighboring property in August while Acera was feeding their horses when the shooting happened.

“As I was walking down I heard a gunshot and then a dog yell” Acera said. “And then a few seconds later I heard another gunshot and another dog yelp. And then I immediately thought ‘oh no I hope it’s not them.’”

Acera said he ran to the neighboring property to find his animals dead on the ground. He said his neighbor told him the dogs were messing with his horses so he shot them.

“They have been around horses before and their breed is not aggressive” Autele said.

According to criminal defense lawyer Victor Bakke people can defend themselves and their pets from other animals using reasonable force.

“They would be allowed to use force in a reasonable amount necessary to address the danger presented by the dogs” Bakke said. “So they could hit them with a stick kick them to get away. But pulling out a gun and shooting the dogs unless there was a strong reason to believe that the dogs were likely to injure or kill the horse seriously would be an abuse of force.”

The family said the man who shot their dogs is a parolee and they were called to give a statement to the Hawaii Paroling Authority.

Documents showed that man was taken into custody the same day for violating his parole. However the couple said they hope he would be charged for killing their family pets.

“I don’t want this case just shoved under a desk because they’re just dogs” Acera said. “They’re not just dogs. They were our family.”

Bakke said the man could face a felony for unjustifiably shooting the dogs.

According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection field operation officers at a port of entry in Laredo seized cocaine valued at $4.2 million within a tractor-trailer on Tuesday.

“Our frontline officers have displayed an unparalleled commitment to CBP’s priority border security mission seizing a fourth significant cocaine load in the cargo environment this week” said Laredo Port of Entry Director Alberto Flores.

Authorities said Tuesday’s bust was at the World Trade Bridge and involved a tractor-trailer hauling a shipment of plastic ethylene sheets. Officers referred the tractor-trailer for a secondary inspection where 209 packages containing 545 pounds of alleged cocaine were discovered.

The agency said the narcotics had an estimated street value of $4.2 million.

“These seizures illustrate the gravity of the narcotics threat we are facing and the effective application of CBP officer inspections experience resources and technology” Flores said.

The narcotics were seized and officials said the incident was under further investigation.

The nine-month Ultimate World Cruise is billed as the longest world cruise in history and it will take place aboard Royal Caribbean International’s 962-foot Serenade of the Seas visiting all seven continents and hitting over 150 destinations in more than 60 countries. Deep inside the ship’s belly powering it throughout its voyage will be GE technology.

Readers of GE Reports are familiar with this tech: a powerful gas turbine that uses a jet engine (thus their name “aeroderivative”) modified to generate energy. Based on the CF6 engine which powers Air Force One and many Boeing planes this year the aeroderivative turbine — GE calls it the LM2500 — surpassed 100 million operating hours. These turbines are used all over the world in applications such as mobile power oil and gas and the manufacture of various products. They’re also helping U.S. utilities to transition away from coal and bring more renewables online. And they even power seagoing vessels — including some of the world’s largest ships.

Among them are the 1132-foot Queen Mary 2 the only remaining true ocean liner in the world which employs two of the turbines working in tandem with diesel generators. Beyond that 40 navies in the world use them on 600 of their ships — from Italian aircraft carriers to U.S. Navy destroyers to frigates in the Royal Thai Navy. And Royal Caribbean Group which is not alone among cruise operators uses the engine on eight ships across its Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises cruise lines. Royal Caribbean Group in fact is one of the top global fleet operators of LM2500 gas turbines with 24 turbines total — two per ship on its eight ships plus eight spares.

But the Serenade of the Seas is special. The 2490-guest cruise ship first set sail in 2003 — with Whoopi Goldberg as its “godmother” — and it’s sailed through the Caribbean into the Baltic and from Seattle to Alaska. Because of its track record and the onboard experiences it has to offer it was the ship that Royal Caribbean chose for the record-setting voyage.

“The fact that out of all 64 of their ships they’re choosing this ship to be the flagship vessel for this around-the-world cruise I think that’s pretty awesome” says Albert Whiteside an engineer and senior sales manager with GE Power who manages the Royal Caribbean Group account along with Barbara Beck customer service leader.

Until about 2000 diesel engines dominated the cruise industry. The introduction of gas turbines has allowed companies to continue to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur oxide emissions. The turbines also require less engine room space and have comparably lower noise and vibrations for a more pleasant experience for guests and crew members.

This spring Whiteside traveled to the Bahamas to observe an extensive upgrade of the ship’s control system which runs the Serenade’s combined-cycle power plant. The culmination of talks that began in 2018 the upgrade project was managed by GE and executed in partnership with GE’s FieldCore business control systems designer Woodward and energy technology company Bently Nevada. The combined gas turbine and steam turbine integrated electric drive system (COGES) arrangement features two GE LM2500+ gas turbine generators and one steam turbine generator which together provide 59 megawatts for both main ship propulsion and all onboard power generation needs.

Another big reason why cruise companies use these turbines is their reliability. They are operated by advanced control systems that aim to ensure that the ship operates efficiently and safely. “We love the reliability of GE LM2500+ gas turbines its durable design and low downtime. In case of planned — or in rare cases unplanned — work we can replace the entire engine in 12 hours” says Anders Aasen vice president of global marine operations for Royal Caribbean Group. “This makes it a dream for every engineer on board.”

Royal Caribbean Group in fact is one of the top global fleet operators of LM2500 gas turbines with 24 turbines total — two per ship on its eight ships plus eight spares.

But the Serenade of the Seas is special. The 2490-guest cruise ship first set sail in 2003 — with Whoopi Goldberg as its “godmother” — and it’s sailed through the Caribbean into the Baltic and from Seattle to Alaska. Because of its track record and the onboard experiences it has to offer it was the ship that Royal Caribbean chose for the record-setting voyage.

“The fact that out of all 64 of their ships they’re choosing this ship to be the flagship vessel for this around-the-world cruise I think that’s pretty awesome” says Albert Whiteside an engineer and senior sales manager with GE Power who manages the Royal Caribbean Group account along with Barbara Beck customer service leader.

Until about 2000 diesel engines dominated the cruise industry. The introduction of gas turbines has allowed companies to continue to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur oxide emissions. The turbines also require less engine room space and have comparably lower noise and vibrations for a more pleasant experience for guests and crew members.

This spring Whiteside traveled to the Bahamas to observe an extensive upgrade of the ship’s control system which runs the Serenade’s combined-cycle power plant. The culmination of talks that began in 2018 the upgrade project was managed by GE and executed in partnership with GE’s FieldCore business control systems designer Woodward and energy technology company Bently Nevada. The combined gas turbine and steam turbine integrated electric drive system (COGES) arrangement features two GE LM2500+ gas turbine generators and one steam turbine generator which together provide 59 megawatts for both main ship propulsion and all onboard power generation needs.

Another big reason why cruise companies use these turbines is their reliability. They are operated by advanced control systems that aim to ensure that the ship operates efficiently and safely. “We love the reliability of GE LM2500+ gas turbines its durable design and low downtime. In case of planned — or in rare cases unplanned — work we can replace the entire engine in 12 hours” says Anders Aasen vice president of global marine operations for Royal Caribbean Group. “This makes it a dream for every engineer on board.”

It's really not that bad. The fundamental technological issues remain: the glaring shadow pop-in is back - and actually a bit worse here. The buggy NPC animations and physics return too. And lastly of course the 60fps target of the PS5 and Series X versions gives way to something lower on last-gen machines - a sub-40fps frame-rate or even sub-30 in stress-test scenarios. Performance is still unlocked too when a 30fps cap really would have made a positive difference but I went into this one with low expectations which the last-gen versions comfortably exceed.

Similar to Xbox Series S the wealth of performance mode variations seen in the Series X and PS5 releases are gone. There are no graphics toggles of any kind. On top of that ray tracing features are absent of course but that's fine. There seem to be fixed pixel counts on all systems with no obvious dynamic resolution scaling but what is interesting is how the HUD overlay actually does seem to change res. It's very very odd. In-game DRS can't be entirely ruled out but the game looks consistent in terms of image quality with only the flickering HUD giving any sense of a resolution change.

Looking at the qualities of the last-gen versions you'd expect Xbox One X to deliver the best rendition of the game - but that's only partly true here. At least in image quality you're getting a very decent turn-out here at a native 2560x1440 up from the less than stellar 1080p on PlayStation 4 Pro. The One X's 1440p also trumps Series S's full HD output - but quality settings are dialled back (particularly in terms of foliage density) and the unlocked performance level is actually worse than the PS4 Pro experience. With that being the case there's no real 'winner' here in terms of the last-gen machines as while the One X looks significantly cleaner frame-rates can hit a 24fps nadir - Pro is smoother overall if far from smooth and consistent in its delivery.

Saints Row PS4/Pro vs Xbox One/X Tested: Can Last-Gen Consoles Cope? Four more versions of Saints Row come under the microscope. Can the last-gen versions cope when the current wave of consoles weren't exactly running at their best?Watch on YouTube

Can last-gen consoles handle Saints Row? Well so far we've seen that the enhanced machines lose a little detail and a big chunk of performance compared to their more modern counterparts but rough frame-rates aside it looks similar with only minor tweaks to settings. On the base machines however developer Volition has to cut deeper. Interestingly the vanilla PS4 operates with the same rendering resolution as the Pro - full HD 1080p - but grass density takes a hit shadow draw distance is pruned back noticeably while shadow quality itself and indeed effects quality are of a much lower resolution. It comes as no surprise to see those same compromises are also deployed on Xbox One S which also sees pixel counts drop to 1536x864 making it the blurriest version of the lot.

Perhaps the biggest issue with base PS4 and Xbox One is the frame-rate. Performance hovers at the 30fps line on the Sony machine wavering just over and under all the way through. Sometimes the variance is by two to three frames per second but it's always around that number. The fact it stabilises around 30fps does again suggest DRS may be in effect but 1080p comes up in every single pixel count. So one theory is that maybe there's a dynamic nature to the visual settings themselves - to ambient occlusion post effects and more - similar to how Elden Ring works.

It'd certainly explain how and why the frame-rate clings to 30fps almost like it's being guided to that 30fps mark and it would also explain how it does this without a 30fps cap too. Cutscenes however can see performance tank to a low of just under 20fps. Performance results are unexpected with Xbox One though which actually runs slightly better than PS4 in many areas by anything up to five frames per second. Even with its resolution deficit there's the sense that there's more going on here than meets the eye bearing in mind the higher performance level on the least capable last-gen machine.

All told Saints Row isn't a disaster on any of these four older systems despite the inconsistent nature of the game running on the newer far more capable machines. PS4 Pro offers the smoothest frame-rate of the bunch while Xbox One X has the best image quality - but even the base Xbox One S turns in a frame-rate often above 30fps. The visual cutbacks are glaring especially on base PS4 and Xbox One but all releases are playable - and would benefit still further if performance was capped at 30fps with even frame delivery as opposed to the unlocked frame-rate seen here.

As I said I went into this with low expectations and to be clear this is hardly the ideal way to play the game - but it's not radically off the mark when stacked up against the current-gen renditions we looked at previously. Beyond the resolution upgrade the better draw distances and improved shadows the game is comparable and the new consoles aren't exactly delivering a generational improvement. What we're seeing in Saints Row is a project clearly built with older PS4 and Xbox One-based limits in mind.

With Saints Row's bugs and lack of polish alongside the visual quirks present on every system the game looks and runs better than you'd think on last-gen hardware. Even so it's hard to wholeheartedly recommend any of the last-gen versions. Mostly I went into this expecting the worst - especially on base Xbox One - but it turns out that all four consoles run Saints Row well enough and there are clear ways for the developer to whip this game into shape beyond bug fixes (did we mention a 30fps cap?). There are issues here but they are not insurmountable - so I remain hopeful that further updates could yet transform the fortunes of this game.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaG5vbG9neW1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9kaWdpdGFsLXRyYW5zZm9ybWF0aW9uL3RoZS1pbXBhY3Qtb2YtaHlicmlkLXdvcmtpbmctZnJvbS1nZW4tei10by1iYWJ5LWJvb21lcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The impact of hybrid working from Gen Z to Baby Boomers,"When it comes to the discourse around the way we work in the new era of hybrid working it has never felt more balanced between the technology that enables it and the culture that defines it. As well as investing in the latest digital experience technologies to support employees wherever they choose to work organisations are also having to re-think the culture of a workforce that is no longer confined to an office full-time.

If making a decision between permanent hybrid working and a return to the office wasn’t hard enough employers also need to consider the different and often opposing views of the talent who will define their now and their future. But there isn’t always consensus across age groups on where and how they want to work and it’s leading to major differences in experience and performance. According to our research  since the start of the pandemic 62% of 18-25 years olds have been promoted versus just 13% of 56+ years olds.

Businesses are having to respond to these differences by making the working environment more inclusive and dare I say flexible. But it is complicated. How organisations choose to deal with this generational roadblock and difference in views will be one of the biggest deciders on who succeeds in the new era of hybrid working.

What are these differences and what is the impact on businesses that are already struggling to access critical skills following the much reported ‘Great Resignation’ – employment rates and job vacancies are reaching pre-pandemic levels in many European countries - and less reported but no less impactful ‘Grey Resignation’?

The importance of connection

The starkest gap can be seen in how the age groups view the development of personal connections. Our research found that 70% of Generation Z (18-25 years olds) believe that the change in working circumstances has improved their personal connections with colleagues whereas only 30% of Baby Boomers (56+ years olds) can say the same. It may come down to what they’re used to – with Baby Boomers having worked in the office for their whole working careers – but maintaining and building connections to foster collaborative supportive teams for everyone must be top of mind for employers. It’s why – according to the 2022 VMware Forrester Digital Employee Experience Report - 60% of businesses globally are prioritising an average $500K investment in a comprehensive digital employee experience platform over the next 24 months with 80% citing employee productivity as one of the key drivers behind the investment.

Workers surveyed for the BCG COVID-19 Employee Sentiment Survey who felt less socially connected to their colleagues during the pandemic were less productive on collaborative tasks compared to before the pandemic and only 30% of Baby Boomers believe that employee productivity has increased with the introduction of remote working.

Regardless of whether they are in the office or working elsewhere employers need to consider how to enable greater opportunities for social connections across generations.

Supporting older talent

The other stark gap in views centre around freedom of expression and thought within groups of employees of a similar seniority. Like personal connections the gap between the youngest (Generation Z) and oldest (Baby Boomer) is a significant 40%. And though the gap between the groups gets smaller when asked about increasing employee optimism to 25% the statistics reveal a worrying trend that Baby Boomers in particularly are feeling increasingly isolated unheard and pessimistic.

This trend is reflected by what has been dubbed the ‘Grey Resignation’. The ‘A U-Shaped Crisis’ report by the Resolution Foundation revealed the pandemic has led to the biggest annual fall in employment for older workers (50-29 years olds) since the 1980s. It’s an issue as Pilita Clark wrote for the FT because “it can cause big problems for organisations that have become accustomed to a ready supply of older experienced workers and lack the ability to quickly train new staff”. Finding solutions to support this group in the new hybrid era is vital.

Generational agreement on the value of performance

While the generational groups may be divided on their experiences of remote working they are agreed on two important things.

Firstly that working in a remote or distributed environment has led to employees being valued more on performance and less on traditional metrics such as time spent in the office.

It’s an important message for employers – 70% of whom have either already implemented or are planning to implement employee surveillance measures to monitor employee productivity in a bid to find new ways of measuring productivity outside of traditional office parameters – that there is a very fine line between monitoring and spying.

The second point of consensus is around the leadership skills required to create high-performing teams in all environments. All placed communication skills at the top followed by the ability to trust employees digital fluency across a range of platforms and adaptability to new modes of measuring employee performance.

Embracing flexibility to support all employees

One of the hallmarks of hybrid working is flexibility. The opportunity to close these gaps while transitioning to the new hybrid working model is one that employers need to take advantage of to ensure that they are building genuinely inclusive diverse workforces.

Businesses today are operating in a tricky labour market. While finding that balance may feel difficult to attain research shows that there is one very important correlation. The correlation between increasing personal connections and consequently increasing productivity and team performance. While this is particularly true of the older generations who are struggling with feeling isolated and unheard connections across all ages are what help people flourish.

In the new digital hybrid era employees want to feel valued connected supported and encouraged regardless of where and how they work. For employers this is an opportunity to evolve the culture of their workforce to one that takes into consideration the needs of everyone and lean in to the digital experience technologies that can make the contented ‘anywhere workforce’ a reality.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVub3IuY29tL21lZGlhL25ld3Nyb29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3RlbGVub3ItYXNpYS1kaWdpdGFsLWxpdmVzLWRlY29kZWQtbGl2ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Telenor Asia Study Reveals 5 Key Trends for Continued Surge,"People across Asia are united by a firm belief that connectivity empowers them with more economic opportunity daily convenience and greater access to essential services according to Telenor Asia’s new “Digital Lives Decoded” study.

Jason M. Allen was almost too nervous to enter his first art competition. Now his award-winning image is sparking controversy about whether art can be generated by a computer and what exactly it means to be an artist.

In August Allen a game designer who lives in Pueblo West Colorado won first place in the emerging artist division’s “digital arts/digitally-manipulated photography” category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition. His winning image titled “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial” (French for “Space Opera Theater”) was made with Midjourney — an artificial intelligence system that can produce detailed images when fed written prompts. A $300 prize accompanied his win.

“I’m fascinated by this imagery. I love it. And it think everyone should see it” Allen 39 told CNN Business in an interview on Friday.

Courtesy Jason M. Allen

Allen’s winning image looks like a bright surreal cross between a Renaissance and steampunk painting. It’s one of three such images he entered in the competition. In total 11 people entered 18 pieces of art in the same category in the emerging artist division.

The definition for the category in which Allen competed states that digital art refers to works that use “digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process.” Allen stated that Midjourney was used to create his image when he entered the contest he said.

Midjourney is one of a growing number of such AI image generators — others include Google Research’s Imagen and OpenAI’s DALL-E 2. Anyone can use Midjourney via Discord while DALL-E 2 requires an invitation and Imagen has not been opened up to users outside Google.

The newness of these tools how they’re used to produce images and in some cases the gatekeeping for access to some of the most powerful ones has led to debates about whether they can truly make art or assist humans in making art.

This came into sharp focus for Allen not long after his win. Allen had posted excitedly about his win on Midjourney’s Discord server on August 25 along with pictures of his three entries; it went viral on Twitter days later with many artists angered by Allen’s win because of his use of AI to create the image as a story by Vice’s Motherboard reported earlier this week.

“This sucks for the exact same reason we don’t let robots participate in the Olympics” one Twitter user wrote.

“This is the literal definition of ‘pressed a few buttons to make a digital art piece’” another Tweeted. “AI artwork is the ‘banana taped to the wall’ of the digital world now.”

Yet while Allen didn’t use a paintbrush to create his winning piece there was plenty of work involved he said.

“It’s not like you’re just smashing words together and winning competitions” he said.

You can feed a phrase like “an oil painting of an angry strawberry” to Midjourney and receive several images from the AI system within seconds but Allen’s process wasn’t that simple. To get the final three images he entered in the competition he said took more than 80 hours.

First he said he played around with phrasing that led Midjourney to generate images of women in frilly dresses and space helmets — he was trying to mash up Victorian-style costuming with space themes he said. Over time with many slight tweaks to his written prompt (such as to adjust lighting and color harmony) he created 900 iterations of what led to his final three images. He cleaned up those three images in Photoshop such as by giving one of the female figures in his winning image a head with wavy dark hair after Midjourney had rendered her headless. Then he ran the images through another software program called Gigapixel AI that can improve resolution and had the images printed on canvas at a local print shop.

Allen is glad the debate over whether AI can be used to make art is capturing so much attention.

“Rather than hating on the technology or the people behind it we need to recognize that it’s a powerful tool and use it for good so we can all move forward rather than sulking about it” Allen said.

Cal Duran an artist and art teacher who was one of the judges for the competition said that while Allen’s piece included a mention of Midjourney he didn’t realize that it was generated by AI when judging it. Still he sticks by his decision to award it first place in its category he said calling it a “beautiful piece”.

“I think there’s a lot involved in this piece and I think the AI technology may give more opportunities to people who may not find themselves artists in the conventional way” he said.

Allen won’t yet say what the text prompt was behind his winning image — he’s planning to keep it a secret until he publishes a larger related work that he hopes will be finished later this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxpbmZvcm1hdGlvbndvcmxkLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5L2l0LW1heS1jb21lLWFzLXN1cnByaXNlLXRvLXNvbWUtYnV0LWdlbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,It may come as a surprise to some but Gen Z still uses Facebook,Ever since Instagram came into the picture Facebook has always been sidelined by the younger generation. They see it as an app used by old people and an app that is full of conspiracy theories then TikTok also made its debut and stole away the hearts of youngsters but according to new data posted by Data.ai in the US the most used social media app by Gen Z is Facebook based on monthly user data.That should be surprising right? It isn't.Why? Because in the second list of the chart apps like Reddit Instagram TikTok and Snapchat are more likely to be used by Gen Z as compared to the overall population of the United States but according to data Gen Z is regularly logging into apps like Facebook and Messenger.According to Data.ai themselves users from ages 18-29 have self-reported that they have turned away from using social media but all other apps that track usage have had their usage time increased.However it should be noted that data.ai's revelations are purely based on actual usage which shows that around the world the younger generation instead of becoming less active has become more active on social media. This clears that younger users are not inching away from social media at all. There is also one more point of note here and that is data.ai's collection is completely from Android phones and no iOS phones were reviewed. This makes their data a bit segregated but it is enough to provide a general insight into the usage patterns of the younger generation.The chart above which shows Monthly Active Users does not in any way account for the time spent on one app. so if someone just logs into the app for a couple of minutes only to check on family and friend updates will be included in the official charts. This is a major key point that many often overlook and is the reason why MUA charts are now not widely used as a measure of engagement.While Gen Z does often engage more frequently in their favorite social media apps than others it is not always the best for the actual time spent on the app. As a matter of fact in both Germany and the US Gen Xers spent 25% more time on social media than Gen Z.Read next: The most hated and annoying mobile apps in the world

McPhail Obituary","Robert “Bob” Brown McPhail passed away peacefully at his home in Norwich CT on August 25 2022. He was born in New London CT on March 10 1931 the oldest child of the late Mary (Brown) McPhail and Alexander McPhail. His 91 years of life were filled with conscientious work numerous friendships sports community service and love for his family.

Bob as he preferred to be called was raised in New London and was always proud to say so. He attended the C. B. Jennings Elementary School and graduated high school in 1949 from the former Bulkeley School where he was the class salutatorian and quarterback of the football team. During summers when not pulling pranks on his siblings and friends he was a lifeguard at Ocean Beach Park along with his brother Norman and several close friends. He always looked forward to reminiscing with his Bulkeley classmates every August at the school’s annual reunion.

Bob attended Amherst College on an academic scholarship but after a couple years his education was interrupted by his service in the United States Coast Guard during the Korean War. After concluding his military service Bob continued his education at the University of Connecticut and graduated in 1957 with high honors in business administration. He also later earned his master’s degree in education from the University of Connecticut.

Soon after graduating from UConn Bob married Jane Novak on June 22 1957 and the couple moved to Ludlow MA when he took a job at the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company. Their first child Cynara was born there in 1958. Shortly after the family headed back to Bob’s hometown of New London when he became employed by General Dynamics/Electric Boat Division. It was there that they welcomed their second child Marlin in 1959. The family then soon moved to Norwich the city Bob would call home for the remainder of his life. He worked for General Dynamics for 11 years in data processing management and for a short time with The Computer Services Group before making a move to the teaching profession.

In 1969 Bob was encouraged by Charles Hamblen the principal at Norwich Free Academy to go into teaching and was hired by Hamblen to develop a computer technology curriculum at the school. Once at NFA he never left. In addition to his teaching duties Bob quickly got involved with athletics at the school. He was an assistant coach for the football and basketball teams and in 1972 he also became the head coach of the golf team. His year-round coaching roles ended in 1981 when he was appointed the Athletic Director at NFA. He served in that capacity until 1993 when he also retired from teaching but this allowed him to return to coaching the boys golf team in 1994. He continued coaching the boys until 2016 when he was 85 years old. Bob also started the girls golf program at NFA and coached the girls for eight years. He enjoyed travelling with the boys and girls to matches all over the state and he tallied over 700 wins between the two teams. He was founder and director of the Wildcat Invitational Golf Tournament an annual state high school golf event and the Wildcat Scramble an annual fund-raising tournament to provide financial aid for college-bound students who competed in the Eastern Connecticut Conference (ECC). He served as secretary and treasurer of the ECC for over 20 years.

Along the way Bob picked up many honors including Electric Boat Outstanding Intramural Athlete Electric Boat Athletic Hall of Fame Norwich Sportsman of the Year in 1972 the Connecticut High School Coaches Association Outstanding Coach in Golf for 1977 NFA Sports Hall of Fame Norwich Sports Hall of Fame and he was named the 2016 Boys Golf Coach of the Year by the National High School Coaches Association.

Bob took a great interest in his children’s activities and was actively involved in Norwich youth sports. He was on the Board of Directors for the Norwich Little League and Norwich Midget Football League and he was Sports Director for the Norwich Rose Arts Festival. He loved to travel and watch his son Marlin play baseball. He and Jane would frequently take off on weekends to watch Marlin play at Cornell University and they later made many trips across the country to see him play and coach professionally. Bob was also quick to volunteer when his daughter Cynara needed a patient to help complete her requirements at the UConn School of Dental Medicine which required him to make multiple visits to Farmington and sit for hours at a time. He also made sure to attend many of his grandchildren’s activities including baseball games soccer games track and cross country meets and dance recitals.

Bob was an avid golfer and an active member of the Pautipaug Country Club and the Norwich Golf Club. He was also a member of the Norwich Rotary Club and Norwich Elks Club. In the early 1980s he initiated fantasy football and baseball leagues with colleagues and friends before fantasy leagues became popular. A fierce competitor he enjoyed the friendly bantering with his opponents and often took home the bragging rights of a winner. He loved photography and throughout his life took thousands of photos of teams players nature and family. Bob also enjoyed gardening and took pride in the vegetables he grew but he never seemed to produce enough cucumbers for Jane’s pickles. Bob was also a longtime loyal fan of UConn Women’s Basketball; he attended games since the early 1990s had season tickets for over twenty years and traveled to numerous Final Fours.

Bob is survived by Jane his beloved wife of 65 years and their children Dr. Cynara McPhail (Jon Kornacki) and Marlin McPhail (Terry) his cherished grandchildren who referred to him as Pa Amanda Smith (Alex) Sarah Kornacki Ryan McPhail (Brooke) and Daniel Kornacki and four adorable great-granddaughters Camden McPhail Addison Smith Emerson McPhail and Eliza Smith. Bob is also survived by his nephew Michael Kettlety (Michelle) and niece Geralyn McPhail. He was predeceased by his brother Norman McPhail his sister Barbara Pingalore and his niece Norma Jean McPhail Logan.

Funeral arrangements are under the direction of Woyasz and Son Funeral Home 141 Central Avenue Norwich. There will be no calling hours and burial will be private. Friends are invited to a celebration of Bob’s life on Saturday October 1 11:00 to 2:00 at the Holiday Inn 10 Laura Boulevard Norwich CT.

Memorial gifts may be directed to the McPhail Family Athletic Versatility Award at the Norwich Free Academy.

A year ago the United States Navy awarded a $2.42 billion contract modification to General Dynamics’ Electric Boat subsidiary to build an additional Block V Virginia-class submarine equipped with the Virginia Payload Module (VPM). The deal was awarded by The Naval Sea Systems Command in Washington D.C and was an extension of the original contract that was awarded in December 2019 for nine boats with an option for a tenth. With that added submarine the total cost of the contract with primary contractor Electric Boat will be $24.1 billion a net increase of $1.89 billion for the full contract.

The Block V is more than just a few upgrades. In fact the VPM will give the Virginia-class which is already a heavily armed nuclear-powered fast-attack submarine with a massive increase in capabilities. The Block V will greatly increase the number of missiles that can be carried and essentially make it a cruise missile submarine (SSGN).

At the same time it won’t take away from what the boats do best.

Meet the Virginia-class

Designed for use in both the open-ocean and for littoral missions which include anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and intelligence gathering operations the U.S. Navy’s Virginia -class was developed to replace the more expensive Seawolf-class while still providing a capable boat to address nautical threats from near-peer adversaries in the 21st century.

Since entering service in 2004 the Virginia-class subs have been able to support five of the U.S. Navy’s six maritime strategy core capabilities including sea control power projection forward presence maritime security and deterrence. It is able to do this by providing a combination of stealth endurance mobility and firepower.

The SSNs have a fly-by-wire ship control system that also provides improved shallow-water ship handling while subs were also designed to deploy special operator forces including Navy SEALS. A reconfigurable torpedo room can accommodate a large number of SOF and all their equipment for prolonged deployments and future off-board payloads.

Improving the Class

Twenty-two of the planned sixty-six Virginia-class submarines has been completed to date while six more are now under construction. As the Navy is completing the Block IV submarines it is now looking forward to the enhancements provided with the Block V.

All of the ten planned Block V submarines will also be equipped with acoustic superiority upgrades which the Navy has seen as crucial to maintaining design superiority over Russian and Chinese submarines. The overall design will differ from the Block IV boats by approximately twenty percent according to a February 2022 Congressional Research Service (CRS) report.

“Most Virginia-class boats procured in FY2019 and subsequent years are to be built with the Virginia Payload Module (VPM) an additional 84-foot-long mid-body section equipped with four large-diameter vertical launch tubes for storing and launching additional Tomahawk missiles or other payloads. When procured at a rate of two boats per year VPM-equipped Virginia-class SSNs have an estimated procurement cost of about $3.45 billion per boat” the reported noted.

The Block V submarines are larger than the previous versions with the length increased from 377 feet to 460 feet and with greater displacement from 7800 tons to 10200 tons. As a result the Block V versions of the Virginia-class are the second-largest U.S. submarines produced behind only the Ohio-class. This added eighty-three-foot section is to increase the number of missile launch tubes from twelve to forty which in essence could triple the capacity of short targets for each boat.

As part of the Virginia Payload Module (VPM) this extended mid-body section can be used to store and fire additional Tomahawk cruise missiles and other payloads; including large-diameter unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). Each VPM on the Block Vs also provides the capacity for 40 cruise missiles. The VPM also increased the number of torpedo-sized weapons carried by each submarine from about thirty seven to about sixty-five an increase of seventy-six percent.

Additionally with advancements in hypersonic missile technology the Virginia-class’s larger launcher will be well suited to host such weapons once they are deployable. The boats can also host the new version of the anti-ship Maritime Strike Tomahawk.

According to H I Sutton writing for Naval News the Block Vs are expected to receive the Large Vertical Array (LVA) flank sonars – which would be in addition to the six ultra-modern Light Weight Wide Aperture Arrays (LWWAA) that are located along the submarine’s side.

While this has greatly increased the estimated recurring unit procurement costs of the Block V boats the numerous improvements and upgrades will make these the most heavily armed attack submarines ever in the U.S. Navy and could ensure that they’re able to serve well into the 2070s and beyond.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFzaWFudGltZXMuY29tL3ZpZGVvLXNob3dzLXVzLW5hdnlzLW1vc3QtYWR2YW5jZWQtd2Fyc2hpcC1oYXJhc3NlZC_SAVJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJhc2lhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS92aWRlby1zaG93cy11cy1uYXZ5cy1tb3N0LWFkdmFuY2VkLXdhcnNoaXAtaGFyYXNzZWQv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dramatic Video Shows US Navy’s Most Advanced Warship ‘Harassed’ By Unidentified Drone Swarms,"A video released by the United States Navy under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has shown Unidentified Aerial Systems/Phenomena (UAS/P) swarms flying over and around the warship USS Zumwalt in incidents that took place off Southern California in April 2019.

These are part of a much larger series of incidents around US warships and destroyers recorded in ship logs and other United States Navy (USN) personnel testimonies reported by The Drive last year.

The EurAsian Times had written about US fighter pilots and military servicemen revealing their radars and communications jammed while detecting or tracking abnormally moving UAPs.

These incidents have become subjects of major Congressional inquiries. Officials from the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of the Navy have also appeared before lawmakers and indirectly hinted about their helplessness and the sensationalist implications based on the “inexplicability” and “inconclusiveness” of their probes.

Moreover any possible Russia or China hand in the incidents would have instantly been officially alleged by the US military or political leadership – or both. It would be hard to imagine the US giving up such an opportunity to show its rivals in a bad light especially when relations are at their worst.

UAPs ‘Harass’ Zumwalt – Video

The incident occurred on April 24 2019 at 8:30 pm Pacific Time around 17 nautical miles from the US Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton in international waters.

The Zumwalt had reported as many as six UAS operating at nearby altitudes ranging between 300 and 1000 feet. At one point the UAS crossed over the Zumwalt’s deck. Other incidents with other US warships had been recorded by their own Ship Nautical or Otherwise Photographic Interpretation and Exploitation Team (SNOOPIE) team of sailors.

The video released shows the incident to have occurred at night and is quite hazy and heavily pixelated. It would be far-fetched not to assume the Zumwalt’s onboard sensors did not detect anything worthwhile.

However those findings would mostly be protected from public scrutiny under the FOIA as militarily or strategically sensitive information much like the Right to Information (RTI) Act.

The clearer part of the video shows a set of several lights appearing to be white and green in a rectangular formation. One of the sailors is even heard saying that the UAS does not appear to be armed.

The narration by the sailor describes them as “flying consistent patterns northwest east south without alteration of course speed and altitude.” The video ends with the sailor saying that “no weapons were observed.”

What adds more intrigue to the issue is Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Admiral Mike Gilday telling journalists in April 2021 that they had not yet “positively identified” the UAS/UAP. The Department of Defense (DoD) had in August 2020 created the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF).

The UAPTF is led by the Department of the Navy and overseen by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security.

The drones over Zumwalt however don’t appear to be otherworldly based on experts The Drive report quoted. One unnamed drone industry analyst said he couldn’t find anything on the drones in the footage that couldn’t be purchased off-the-shelf.

He also pointed to the narrator’s observation about the fixed flight pattern with no changes in altitude meaning the drones were pre-programmed to fly a specific route.

This would make sense for an adversary spying on an advanced US defense platform since full and continuous remote human control with an active radio link makes the drone vulnerable to Radio Frequency (RF) jamming.

A reason for the Zumwalt to not react is the fear of falling into a trap where it is forced to reveal its radar and electronic frequencies disclosing valuable Signals Intelligence (SIGINT).

Documentary Films & Congressional Hearings

Interestingly Ronald S Moultrie the current Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security requested a closed-door hearing when questioned during a Congressional Committee chaired by Congressman Andre Carlson.

While Gilday in the April 2021 media interaction denied the extra-terrestrial possibility saying he “has no indications at all of that” Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence Scott Bray had admitted some sightings that US officials “just can’t explain.”

Some of the most famous footage shows UAP/UFOs moving seamlessly between the sea and the air. The US submarines reported detecting objects moving at unprecedented speeds and maneuverability beyond human-made craft.

For instance pilots over the years having spotted hazy-looking UAVs say that being incredibly fast-moving and nimble objects should still have essential aerodynamic characteristics like having some form of propulsion/exhaust and latent kinetic energy.

The objects are shown moving without any thrust at speeds nearly at Mach 1.5 and suddenly changing direction stopping on a dime or accelerating in a way that looks like it is just shooting ahead.

“There are a small handful of cases in which we have more data than our analysis simply hasn’t been able to fully pull together a picture of what happened” adding that the UFO/UAPs had “unexpected flight characteristics” Bray said before Congress.

The videos combine the Navy’s radar screens and thermal and infrared recordings from the electro-optical tracking systems (EOTS) aboard US Navy warships helicopters reconnaissance aircraft and fighter jets.

The issue garnered international attention after releasing the 2004 footage captured by Commander Chad Underwood now known as the “tic-tac” drone event. Underwood reported several strobe lines on his radar screen which he later said were “jam lines” to Corbell. Underwood also replies in the affirmative when asked if his radar was going awry after detecting the ‘tic tac’ UFO/UAP as an “indication of an active jamming.”

“Once I got the target of interest on my radar I took a ‘lock’ and that’s when all the funky things started happening. The erratic nature of the ‘tic tac’ the airspeed was telling to me. Then we started seeing jam ‘strobe lines.’ Strobe lines are vertical lines that show up on your radar indicating that you are being jammed” he noted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyL3NlcC8wNC9mb3J0LXNtaXRocy1tYXJ0aW4tZ29vZHdpbi1ydW4tZm9yLWNpdHktZGlyZWN0b3JzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fort Smith’s Martin Goodwin run for city directors seat,"



FORT SMITH -- Voters will choose between a newcomer and a current board member for at-large Position 7 for the city's Board of Directors.

Early voting begins Oct. 24 and the election will be held Nov. 8.

Running for the at-large Position 7 seat are political newcomer Jackson Goodwin and current board member Neal Martin.

At-large positions are elected by all city voters to represent the entire city. Fort Smith also has four wards and representatives on the city board who represent just their wards.

The mayor's job is also up for election. Incumbent George McGill is running unopposed for his second term.

Each board position is nonpartisan and serves a four-year term. The mayor receives $10000 a year and city directors make $1000 a year by attending each of the 24 board meetings or $41.67 per meeting according to the city code. They are not compensated for any board meetings they do not attend. Both positions also receive $5400 a year to reimburse vehicle expenses.

Martin has served one term and said he wants to see the growth the city's had through another term. He said he thinks he's one of the most transparent city directors posting weekly videos to Facebook about what the board did that week and what he expects it to look at next.

Martin works as IT director of Shared Services Center. He said he also works on behalf of the people not city government and he believes that's shown through his votes and interactions with residents.

""I led an effort to defeat an alcohol tax when our bars and restaurants were trying to recover from covid. I felt it was unnecessary"" Martin said. ""I fought for property rights of citizens and I've called for additional auditing of our work for the consent decree. So I feel like I've got the heart of the people. I understand where they come from.""

The city's largest issue is the sewer consent decree he said.

The city entered into a consent decree in January 2015 with the U.S. Department of Justice the Environmental Protection Agency and the Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality. Under the decree Fort Smith agreed to repair and upgrade its sewer system after decades of sewage runoff into local waterways including the Arkansas River.

The city agreed to spend more than $200 million over the next 12 years to upgrade its sewer collection and treatment.

The original decree deadline was Jan. 2 2027 but the city said it couldn't afford to do all of the work by that date. The city was granted a five-year extension to 2032.

""I'm hopeful that we're going to get some relief from the courts through our appeal of a portion of the consent decree and I hope that will lessen it"" he said. ""But we really have got to make sure that we are spending our money wisely and correctly and I believe we have done that up to this point for this federally mandated consent decree. The key thing is we continue to audit we continue to monitor we continue to ensure that we are spending money properly.""

Goodwin a civil engineer at Mickle Wagner Coleman said he's watched and presented at board meetings and now he wants to help as a director.

""I think it's just my deeper understanding of infrastructure in the River Valley"" he said. ""I grew up working construction. I work now as a civil engineer. Really if you look back at what the board of directors votes on the majority of it is rezoning it's budgetary stuff for construction projects engineering projects and related stuff. It's almost all infrastructure and that's the background I come from how I was born and raised and that's what I currently do. So I'd say that's one of my biggest qualifications.

""I think that the biggest issue is the elephant in the room which is the consent decree"" he said. ""I think the sewer flooding issues we've had have been crazy and for too long we've been putting it off. I know the board loves to try to get a time extension for this but I think there comes a point where you just need to buckle up and start building the infrastructure -- or I guess rebuilding the infrastructure in this case.""

Goodwin said some other issues he'd like to address if elected are the Foreign Military Sales program flooding road repairs and the mental health and general well being of residents.

Ebbing Air National Guard Base at Fort Smith Regional Airport was selected last year as the Air Force's preferred location for a pilot training center for Singapore and other countries participating in the Foreign Military Sales program. The proposal would accommodate up to 24 Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II aircraft and move 12 General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons from the Singapore Air Force currently at Luke Air Force Base in Glendale Ariz.

The Department of Defense's second choice location for the program is Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Harrison Township Mich.

The increase in capacity would bring total employment at the Wellston facility to over 1000 full-time employees.

“General Mills has been a cornerstone of this community for more than 35 years and our employees exude a lot of pride in making food the world loves” Stephanie Weaver plant manager at General Mills’ Wellston facility said. “We’re excited to grow our business and employee base in southeastern Ohio and having strong local regional and state partners has been instrumental in our success.”

Totino’s originated in 1951 as a family pizza parlor in Minneapolis Minnesota. Today it’s grown to make more than 300 million party pizzas every year.

“As one of the most recognized food brands around the world General Mills continues to grow and thrive in Ohio” J.P. Nauseef president and CEO JobsOhio said. “The expansion of the Totino’s facility in Wellston and the addition of 30 new jobs for hardworking Ohioans demonstrates the ongoing success that global companies can establish in Ohio.”

The expansion is being supported by a tax credit from the Ohio Department of Development and a $400000 JobsOhio Grant in collaboration with OhioSE toward the building machinery and equipment costs.

“This is a tremendous win for Jackson County” Mike Jacoby OhioSE President said. “General Mills’ investment in Wellston is yet another success story on the benefits of doing business in southern Ohio. The growth tied to this project will contribute to the long-term future of this plant and our region’s food manufacturing industry.”

General Mills is one of several food manufacturers that call Jackson County home.

Coca-Cola Co. McDonald’s Corp. Starbucks Corp. and Yum! Brands Inc. to the growing list of companies suspending some operations in Russia over that country’s invasion of Ukraine.

Ramon Laguarta chief executive officer of PepsiCo Inc. Purchase NY said in an email to employees on March 8 that the company would suspend the sale of beverages like Pepsi Cola 7UP and Mirinda as well as capital investments and all advertising in Russia.

“As a food and beverage company now more than ever we must stay true to the humanitarian aspect of our business” Mr. Laguarta wrote. “That means we have a responsibility to continue to offer our other products in Russia including daily essentials such as milk and other dairy offerings baby formula and baby food. By continuing to operate we will also continue to support the livelihoods of our 20000 Russian associates and the 40000 Russian agricultural workers in our supply chain as they face significant challenges and uncertainty ahead.”

Mr. Laguarta added that PepsiCo has suspended operations in Ukraine and is working to provide aid to Ukrainian refugees in neighboring countries through donations to aid agencies and the ramping up of production at other PepsiCo manufacturing plants in Europe.

The Coca-Cola Co. Atlanta released a brief statement March 8 that it was “suspending its businesses” in Russia but did not provide details.

McDonald’s temporarily will close all its restaurants in Russia and pause all operations in that market according to an email sent March 8 by Chris Kempczinski CEO to employees and franchises.

On the same day Kevin Johnson president and CEO of Starbucks wrote employees saying the company was suspending all business activity in Russia. The company has approximately 130 locations in the country.

“Our licensed partner has agreed to immediately pause store operations and will provide support to the nearly 2000 partners in Russia who depend on Starbucks for their livelihood” he wrote.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine also drew a reaction from Yum! Brands. The owner of the KFC Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands suspended all investment and restaurant development in Russia.

In Russia McDonald’s at the end of 2021 had 847 restaurants with 84% operated by the company. The chain had 108 in Ukraine all operated by the company. The two countries accounted for 2% of McDonald’s systemwide sales in 2021.

“We understand the impact this will have on our Russian colleagues and partners which is why we are prepared to support all three legs of the stool in Ukraine and Russia” Mr. Kempczinski said of restaurants closing in Russia. “This includes salary continuation for all McDonald’s employees in Russia.”

Chicago-based McDonald’s also is paying full salaries to Ukrainian employees has donated $5 million to an employee assistance fund and is supporting relief efforts by the International Red Cross.

“Across the rest of Europe we will stay focused on how McDonald’s can best help those in need both now and in the future” Mr. Kempczinski said. “We have already seen extraordinary leadership by our Ukrainian and Russian teams and I know the rest of the McDonald’s system stands ready to support the large number of refugees who have been displaced by this conflict.

“As we move forward McDonald’s will continue to assess the situation and determine if any additional measures are required. At this juncture it’s impossible to predict when we might be able to reopen our restaurants in Russia. We are experiencing disruptions to our supply chain along with other operational impacts. We will also closely monitor the humanitarian situation.”

Louisville Ky.-based Yum! has about 1000 KFC restaurants and 50 Pizza Hut locations in Russia. Independent operators run nearly all the restaurants under license or franchise agreements. Yum! is donating $1 million to the Red Cross is activating a disaster relief fund to support Ukrainian franchise employees and is matching donations from employees to charities providing relief in Ukraine.

“McDonald’s and other fast-food outlets are under pressure to withdraw from the Russian market” said Ramsey Baghdadi a consumer analyst for GlobalData March 8. “However this is easier said than done for the fast-food industry. Russia represents approximately 0.7% of the global fast-food restaurant’s value in 2020. Such a small proportion of value generation in Russia tells us that fears of losing sales is not the main factor at play here.

“The challenge that foodservice providers have is the very nature of their business model. Fast-food chains such as McDonald’s and KFC often have complicated agreements with their outlets as a large proportion of them are franchises and are not enterprises. So it becomes a much more challenging negotiation to completely stop operations compared to other industries.”

A GlobalData consumer survey released in March showed consumer concern for social causes however.

“As 72% of consumer purchases are driven by a brand’s ethics or support shown toward a social cause it becomes difficult for these companies to balance consumer expectations and their operational needs putting pressure on international fast-food restaurants” Mr. Baghdadi said."

EV

This move falls in line with the previous statements General Motors made back in June about their plan to go completely electric by 2030. Global Vice President of Buick and GMC Duncan Aldred said in a recent interview that in total there are 2000 Buick franchise dealers in the United States. All of them will be offered a buyout for the brand.Once this offer is accepted the respective dealer will no longer have the official rights to sell the Buick brand. Aldred also stated that nearly every dealer that sells Buicks has at least one other GM brand in their portfolio. However this will not affect their business with other such models he mentioned The VP did not go into details about how many dealerships are currently willing to take the deal. But we could form a general idea based on the similarities between this scenario and the one with the Cadillac buyouts completed not even a year ago.Cadillac Global Vice President Rory Harvey publicly stated that 315 Caddy dealerships in the U.S. took the $200000 offer whereas the remaining 560 dealers chose the opposite.If you’re wondering why some of them would take the offer whereas others won’t it mainly boils down to a simple investment choice. On one hand electric cars require less maintenance than conventional-fueled cars. This would be one incentive for a dealership to sell EVs.On the other hand the upgrades for the infrastructure required don’t come cheap. Charging stations aside there’s the matter of the cables running through the building itself.

The new battery plant is the first of potentially four to come online within the next few years and is currently making battery cells for GMC’s Hummer EV.

GM and LG launched the JV in May 2019 before breaking ground in Warren Ohio in July 2020. The company was named Ultium Cells once GM launched the new EV platform of the same name in March 2020.

The new Ohio plant employs about 800 people and is adjacent to GM’s former Lordstown Assembly plant which GM sold to Lordstown Motors in 2019. Once at total capacity GM and LG expect to have 1300 staff. Capacity is given at 40 GWh with options to expand.

However the new battery cells based on GM’s Ultium platform will exclusively power the GMC Hummer pick-up truck and its SUV version for now.

A spokesperson at the plant would not disclose whether they’d also deliver for other GM EVs. “Ultium Cells is a supplier to GM and will not speculate nor comment on a GM product.”

However it is Ultium’s declared mission “to support North American electric vehicle assembly capacity of more than 1 million units by mid-decade while supporting GM plans to supply other automotive companies and other industries including rail aerospace heavy trucking and marine customers.” The company had also confirmed earlier that the Cruise Origin and Cadillac Lyriq would receive Ultium cells.

Ultium marks GM’s move away from NMC (nickel-manganese-cobalt) chemistry as used in the Chevy Bolt to NMCA chemistry adding aluminium. This also reduced the cobalt content by about 70 per cent. The new chemistry was developed with LG Chem.

Ohio battery plant just the start

Ultium Cells is constructing other battery factories in Spring Hill for 23 billion dollars and in Tennessee and Lansing Michigan for $6.6 bn.

A fourth Ultium Cells factory could reportedly come up in Carlisle Indiana but remains unconfirmed.

All locations are in proximity to GM vehicle plants.

The Ohio facility spans 2.8 million square feet equivalent to the size of 30 football fields and has cost GM and LG 2.3 billion dollars.

At the end of July the US Department of Energy announced it could grant the battery joint venture a loan of 2.5 billion dollars. Interesting detail: the money comes from the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) loan programme which has not funded a new programme since 2010. The last AVTM borrower was Tesla but the – then – tiny start-up had repaid the loan early in 2013. Ford and Nissan had also previously benefited from the favourable loan conditions from the programme.

BOWLING GREEN Ky. — Tours of the Corvette assembly plant are set to resume for the first time in about five years officials said.

Tickets can be purchased through the National Corvette Museum’s website beginning on Nov. 1 for tours that will begin before the end of the year a statement from the museum said.

General Motors moved production of the Chevrolet Corvette to Bowling Green Kentucky in 1981 and plant tours allow visitors to watch as the sports cars are made.

Tours of the 1.7 million-square-foot (157935 square-meter) plant were suspended in 2017 due to changes that were being made to the facility and that continued when the COVID 19 pandemic hit the statement said.

“We have been waiting for this day for what feels like an eternity” said Kai Spande plant director for the General Motors Bowling Green Assembly Plant and Board Chairman of the National Corvette Museum. “We cannot wait to start welcoming Corvette customers enthusiasts and friends back for tours of our plant.”

Labor Day in Atlanta can only mean one thing: Atlanta Black Gay Pride Weekend!





Atlanta Black Pride is acclaimed as the largest black gay pride weekend across the United

States heralding approximately 250000 persons into the city across the events throughout the 5 days of the ‘weekend’.





As we get ready for one of the most epic weekends in the city Gaye Magazine caught up with philanthropist promoter and “serial entrepreneur” (as she likes to call herself) Melissa Scott. As the co-founder of the Pure Heat Community Festival and a managing partner of Atlanta Black Pride we wanted to get all the details about one of the largest LGBTQ+ gatherings in the country.

Scott comes from humble beginnings in Augusta and was raised in Baltimore before making her way to Georgia. Scott is a well-known party promoter in Atlanta and dee-jays under the name DJ M.





In 2018 Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms even named Melissa Scott a board member of the city’s LGBTQ Advisory Board. In describing herself Scott considers herself a “Type A OCD motivator”.





In 2022 Atlanta Black Gay Pride celebrates its 26th year and the Pure Heat Community Festival celebrates its 10th year in Atlanta. Scott tells us that the Pure Heat Community Festival simply started as an idea to rent a pavilion at Piedmont Park during Black Pride Weekend and give away free water. Something that was intended as a small idea grew into something much much larger.

With DJ Rick spinning on the ones and twos in their rented pavilion Scott revealed that they expected about 400 people to show up and receive the free water they were giving out that weekend. Instead over 10000 people arrived at the space they occupied and therein lies the beginnings of one of the most recognized events during Atlanta Black Pride weekend.

When asked what Scott appreciates most about identifying as a member of the LGBTQIA+ community she tells us that “it is what it is.” But what resonates with her most is the support that the city of Atlanta provides to the members of the community. Scott tells us that she comes from a time when she almost lost her basketball scholarship in college due to being openly lesbian.





As such she says that she appreciates the constant vigilance that the city pays to our queer community stating that if there is an issue within our community there is no brushing it under the rug.





“The city itself is an ally.”

Being a DJ and promoter Melissa Scott often finds herself in communal social settings which is where she thrives. Through community she has found herself meeting different kinds of people who offer a kaleidoscope of personalities and come from a melting pot of various circumstances.





Scott says that this is where a lot of her outreach and philanthropic intentions began. She stated that social environments can act as “medicine for some people” and so she became more interested in being a part of the solution as opposed to seeing people “self-medicating” in order to survive.

Through this realization Melissa Scott found herself drawn toward more outreach programs involving LGBTQIA youth. Upon realizing that a lot of the youth that she found herself interacting with were in fact homeless Scott discovered that she wanted to find ways to help homeless LGBTQ youth before they got to the point of homelessness.

This year’s Pure Heat Community Festival will also double as the inaugural year for the Pure Heat Community Youth Festival. The youth festival is geared toward members of the LGBTQIA+ community that are between the ages of 14-24 years old and promises to be just as outstanding as its forefather. The youth festival will also have an area of its own along with its own vendors and entertainment.





Creating an inclusive event of this magnitude has been no easy feat for Melissa Scott and her team however. She lets us know that the festival is entirely free and as a queer woman of color she has had her share of navigating obstacles in order to bring the Pure Heat Community Festival to new levels.





“I can say LGBTQIA all day but what that looks like from a corporate standpoint is gay white men… You know this is a festival a free festival for people who love the LGBTQIA community and people who just love people. And so the biggest challenge coming into this was funding.”





Scott states that in trying to receive sponsorship for the Pure Heat Community Festival organizations would reject the proposal stating that they were already sponsoring other (universal) Pride events. Atlanta Black Pride brings over 40 million dollars in revenue to the city over 5 days.

Despite this however Scott tells us that it’s been a constant and enduring endeavor for the festival to receive the recognition and notoriety it rightfully deserves. She continues to say that “we’re getting there” stating that Gilead Sciences and Ace Healthcare Foundation came on as sponsors this year and are the reason that they will be able to launch the youth aspect of the Pure Heat Community Festival.





Scott tells us that one of the many reasons the organization has been pushing to generate income from the festival is to fund some of the outreach programs for the Vision Community Foundation. The Vision Community is a sister organization that hopes to “impact and transform the minority LGBTQI+ community through outreach awareness and prevention.





The Pure Heat Community Festival that takes place during Atlanta Black Pride Weekend has come a long way from its humble beginnings in a pavilion at Piedmont Park. The festival over the years has seen the likes of Nicki Minaj Monica Tiny and Da Brat and BB Judy. Scott makes mention that the year that Nicki Minaj came to Atlanta Black Pride happens to be one of her fondest memories in the festival’s history.





The festival was set to take place not too long after her partner and co-founder of the Pure Heat Community Festival Durand Robinson was murdered and Scott states that she was feeling very unmotivated and saddened by his passing.





In what some may call “perfect timing” Scott turned the radio on in her car to hear Nicki Minaj stating that she was “ready to shut the city down for Atlanta Black Pride Weekend”. And the superstar did indeed make good on her promise.

Pure Heat Community Festival Founder Melissa Scott and Juju James

Scott disclosed that what makes her feel the most prideful as the weekend rolls around every year is the joy that she sees from the patrons that turn up for the festival.





“In the midst of the event if you look out everyone is smiling for no reason.”





She says that is reason enough to push her to do more and more each year for the festival.





The Atlanta Black Pride will kick off on Thursday September 1 2022 and run through to Monday September 5 2022. Scott's annual Pure Heat Community Festival at Piedmont Park will take place Sunday and will host approximately 25 events including a brunch block party and nightly events. There will even be resources available for COVID and Monkeypox testing as well as vaccinations for both respectively.





Atlanta Black Pride Weekend promises to continue its exemplary legacy this upcoming weekend with a host of epic events iconic influencers and fabulous celebrities. The celebration of Pride in any form is a nod to the beautiful spectrum of sexual identities that exist and their narratives.





So Gayes be sure to show up and show out for our city at Atlanta Black Pride! Let’s continue to show the world how much Pride we really have!

The takeaway was that trade in goods as a share of GDP peaked around 2018 but the peak was not synchronised and some of the largest trading economies have not peaked. Sixty percent of the decline was due to a reduction in the value of commodities trade all of which was due to a decline in prices from the mid-2010s to 2020 (the recent spike in commodity prices started after that). The rest was due to unwinding or reshoring of international supply chains (Antras 2021).

The global peak of trade in goods as a share of global GDP is a wake-up call. The alarm clock is telling us that globalisation has changed. The previous columns in this series focused on the part of the change that stems from changes in trade in goods. This was a natural starting point since trade in goods makes up almost 80% of all world trade.

In this column I argue that the future of globalisation is not goods but services – in particular intermediate services. I will present economic logic and facts that support the idea that international commerce will shift to being dominated by trade that I called ‘telemigration’ in my 2019 book The Globotics Upheaval (Baldwin 2019).

The key fact presented in this column is that trade in services has not peaked in the way goods trade has (Figure 1). In sharp contrast to trade in goods trade in services continues to boom and shows no tendency to slow. Note that the scales are very different in the two panels.

Figure 1 Services trade vs goods trade (% of GDP)

Goods trade peaked; services trade did not

Source: Author’s calculations based on WTO (trade data) and WDI database (GDP data current USDs).

The individual economy trends show that non-peak behaviour is widespread when it comes to services trade. Figure 2 (left panel) shows scatter plots of the percentage-point changes in services trade for large traders (economies whose service trade amounts to at least half a percent of world services trade). All of the economies show growth both before and after 2008 except Greece which recorded a slight decline after 2008.

Figure 2 Total service trade before and after 2008; largest traders (left) and G7 (right)

Note: The vertical axis plots cumulative growth after 2008 (2008 to 2019); the horizontal axis plots cumulative growth before 2008 (1990-2008). Covid-19 seriously distorted services trade from 2020 so the chart stops at 2019. The large traders are China Ireland India Poland Korea Singapore Greece Brazil Malaysia Thailand Denmark Spain Ukraine Indonesia the Netherlands (NL) Türkiye Switzerland Finland Portugal Israel Philippines Hong Kong – China Australia Germany Sweden US Saudi Arabia Norway Canada France Chinese Taipei Austria Italy Japan Mexico. Together they account for over 85% of world trade.

Source: Author’s calculations based on WTO (trade data).

The pre-2008 growth is spectacular for many of the nations. While they started from low bases China Ireland and India experienced miraculous growth rates from 1990 to 2008 – all over 1000%. Those with over 500% growth include Poland Korea Singapore Greece Brazil Malaysia and Thailand. China’s growth rate was the highest at 3070%.

Growth did not stop in the post-2008 period. In the 12 years from 2008 to 2020 several of the big traders enjoyed service-export growth over 100%. The Philippines was the league leader with its 228% rise but was a slow starter (only 86% growth before 2008). India’s trade in services rose 1740% from 1990 to 2008 and 102% after 2018. For Ireland – which counts as a major service exporter since tech companies have moved their intellectual property there in pursuit of low taxes (and payments for intellectual property count as trade in services in today’s statistics) – the corresponding figures are 2362% and 179%.

The right panel of Figure 2 spotlights the G7 nations and again we see that all were non-peakers although Italy’s service trade stagnated in the second period. The growth numbers however are more moderate than the emerging economies in the left panel.

The pandemic and services trade: Sectoral decomposition

The pandemic hit goods trade in 2020 but this was more than reversed in 2021. Services trade was hit much harder since it includes international travel international tourism and transportation which were directly impacted by the lockdowns and mobility restrictions. Looking at the sectoral composition of services trade requires a bit of background.

The data on trade in services are in poor shape. They are not really fit to track the impact of trade in services on the global economy. One is nevertheless forced to work with the data that exist rather than the data one might wish for. In official statistics the high-level categorisation divides total services into three baskets. The first two are well understood and easily interpreted – travel (which includes tourism) and transportation. The third is ‘other commercial services’ (OCS). This is harder to explain than it should be for such an important element of international commerce.

OCS is a grab-bag of things ranging from people paying for their Spotify subscriptions and US companies hiring call-centre workers in Manila to payments to the giant Indian outsourcing companies and Gazprom paying Ukraine for transit rights through its pipelines. The pie chart in the right panel of Figure 3 shows the next-level disaggregation of OCS. Some of the services are recognisable but fully 40% is thrown into the ‘other business service’ category. All Indian service outsourcing and all the call centres are piled into ‘telecom computer & info services’ along with payments for international telecommunications. Bunching utility-like services (telecom) together with offshored software development is typical of the non-analytic organising principle that seemed to have been used in collecting the statistics.

Figure 3 Services trade by major category (% of GDP)

Travel and transport dropped with Covid-19

Note: EU trade excludes intra-EU trade since here we take the EU as a mega-economy.

Source: Author’s calculations based on WTO (trade data) and WDI database (GDP data current USDs).

Figure 3 shows trends of the three high-level categories. The first two categories were especially hard hit by Covid-19 and the accompanying lockdowns and travel restrictions. According to the latest data (2020) travel has still not recovered (for example China is still not easily accessible to travellers and the government discourages Chinese from leaving the territory). Transport services also suffered and have not recovered.

Note that the travel category like trade in goods did peak in 2008. This is to be expected as international transport services are closely tied to trade in goods. Travel and OCS did not peak and indeed OCS is still booming.

Other commercial services trade has grown much faster than goods trade

It is useful to focus on OCS trade since it is dominated by activities that – like trade in goods – are done in one economy and sold to another. Figure 4 shows that worldwide OCS flows have grown faster than trade in goods for decades (left panel) but the divergent paths became more pronounced after the 2008-09 Great Trade Collapse (Baldwin 2006). While trade in goods recovered in 2010 it has stagnated overall. By contrast OCS has continued to grow rapidly. Between 1990 and 2020 goods expanded five-fold while OCS multiplied by 11 times.

Figure 4 Trade in ‘other commercial services’ (OCS) has grown twice as fast as goods trade since 1990 and now constitutes 20% of all international commerce

Note: The series here are not as a share of GDP; they are values indexed to 1990 = 100 to stress the trends.

Source: Author’s calculations based on WTO (trade data).

The right panel shows how this has shifted the importance of services in international commerce. In 1990 OCS accounted for only 9% of all trade in goods and services but by 2020 that figure had tripled and its rise shows no sign of abating.

The future of globalisation is trade in intermediate services

I turn now to the argument I first made in Baldwin (2022) that the future of trade is services especially intermediate services. The argument boils down to four facts and a deduction.

First barriers to trade in most services are now orders of magnitude higher than the barriers to trade in goods (Benz and Jaax 2022) but many of today’s service barriers are technological rather than fiscal or regulatory.

Services are hard to tax at the border so most barriers arise from domestic regulation (OECD 2022). Much of this regulation however concerns ‘final’ services not ‘intermediate’ services. For example while there are strict rules for selling accounting services in the US there are few rules concerning the qualifications of the service workers that do the paperwork behind the provision of such accounting services. A US accountant can employ pretty much anybody to tally up a client’s travel expenses and collate them with expense receipts. The quality control burden falls on the sellers of the final service not government regulators.

Examples of occupations that provide intermediate as opposed to final services include bookkeepers forensic accountants CV screeners administrative assistants online client help staff graphic designers copyeditors personal assistants travel agents IT security consultants IT help staff software engineers lawyers who can check contracts financial analysts who can write reports and the list goes on and on.

The key point is that imported services are hard to tax when they cross the border. Protection of the domestic service sector relies on regulation. Most of the regulation however only applies to final services. Such regulation restricts who and how a service can be sold from a service provider to a final service customer. Generally these don’t apply to intermediate services. As a result the main barriers to trade in intermediate services are technical – for example the difficulties of coordinating work teams that include faraway workers.

The second fact is that digitech is rapidly lowering the technological barriers to trade in intermediate services.

These first two facts mean that service-trade barriers are falling radically faster than goods-trade barriers and are likely to continue doing so for the foreseeable future.

The third fact is that export capacity in emerging markets is not as great a limiting factor in services as it is in goods since every nation has a workforce that is already producing intermediate-service tasks.

All emerging market economies have lots of workers trained to do intermediate services domestically in all the occupations listed above. There is no need to develop whole new sectors build factories or develop farms or mines.

The fourth fact is that demand is not a limiting factor. Businesses in G7 nations spend a great deal on intermediate services – some of this could be provided by foreign-based workers.

A rough idea can be had by looking at all the tasks that were done remotely during the pandemic. Services are three times more important as intermediate inputs into domestic production than manufactures. The key role of trade in intermediate goods is widely recognised in the whole global value chain debate (Johnson 2014). What is little known is that intermediate services are vastly more important in leading economies. Table 1 shows for the French economy that at the level of the whole economy (bottom row) intermediate service inputs account for 30% of the total gross output while manufactured intermediates account for only 11%. Note that ‘gross output’ is GDP plus the use of all intermediates consumed in the production of the final value added.

Table 1 Intermediate services and manufacturing in the French economy 2018

Source: Author’s manipulation of calculations produced by Rebecca Freeman and Angelos Theodorakopoulos using the OECD’s inter-country input-output database. See Baldwin et al. (2022).

The deduction is simplicity itself.

Barriers are radically higher and falling radically faster for services versus goods and unlike farm and factory goods there is no capacity constraint when it comes to intermediate services. This suggests to me that the future of trade lies in services – in particular intermediate services.

Concluding remarks

Trade in goods has stagnated for a decade and a half. Trade in services has not. Goods trade is still larger but services now account for almost a quarter of export earnings globally. It also accounts for many export jobs especially for women since producing services is more labour intensive than producing goods.

The divergence between the growth of services versus goods happened because digital technology opened the door to trade in intermediate services and high-income countries have few or no barriers to this sort of exports. India for instance performed its service-export miracle without signing a single trade agreement.

Annex

This annex provides a more extensive look at some of the key empirical points in the main text. We start by looking at the key component of services trade: other commercial services (OCS).

Related work by international organisations

The most recent World Development Report leads to the same conclusion using a purpose-built categorisation of services trade (World Bank 2021). The publication points out that what they call ‘data-driven services’ have increased from about one-quarter to almost half of total service exports. In an important World Bank book Nayyar et al. (2021) look at how OCS is enabling ‘service-led development’.

The International Labour Organization’s flagship report (ILO 2021) which focuses on international freelancing points out that:

a trend has developed towards outsourcing work both low-skilled and high-skilled especially as traditional businesses look to digital labour platforms and digital tools to meet their needs for human resources. These platforms host workers from around the world enabling businesses to complete their tasks at a faster pace and lower price than if the tasks were performed on site. In many instances the work is outsourced on these platforms by businesses in the global North and performed by workers in the global South.

OCS scatter plot for large traders and the G7 economies

The main text of this column presented the facts for total services trade but that includes the peculiar categories of transport and travel services. Here we look at the OCS category alone since it presents a closer analogy to trade in goods i.e. where trade means things made in one country and sold in another.

Figure A1 (left panel) confirms the Figure 2 finding that individual economies generally do not display peaking behaviour. Thus in contrast to goods trade the non-peaking result is almost universal among large economies. The figure shows the scatter plots of the percentage-point changes in services trade for large traders (economies whose service trade amounts to at least half a percent of world services trade). All of the economies show growth both before and after 2008 except Italy which recorded a slight decline after 2008.

Together they account for over 80% of world trade.

As with overall services trade the pre-2008 growth (cumulative from 1990 to 2008) is spectacular for many of the nations. China Ireland India Thailand Poland and Brazil had rates over 1000%. In the 12 years from 2008 to 2020 several of the big traders enjoyed service export growth over 100%. The Philippines was the league leader with its 227% rise but was a slow starter (only 230% growth before 2008). India’s trade in services rose 2680% from 1990 to 2008 and 110% after 2018. The right panel breaks out the G7 nations for better visibility. All but Italy were non-peakers.

Who are the big players in the trade in services arena?

The global shares of the largest OCS exporters are shown in Figure A2 (left panel). The top ten exporting nations account for about two-thirds of all service exports. The US UK Ireland Germany and the Netherlands alone account for about 40% of world exports. Adding in India and China brings the total to over half. The right panel shows that most of the large emerging economies are seeing faster-than-average growth in their service exports.

While advanced economies still account for the bulk of service exports worldwide the role of emerging economies is fast gaining pace. The biggest emerging market exporters of services are – in order – China India (with 5% of the world total each) Korea Poland the Philippines and Brazil. The world export of OCS has risen by 1.7 times since 2005 but the OCS exports from China and India for instance have almost tripled.

A more disaggregated look at trade in services

The OCS category consists of a few big items and many small items as Figure 3 illustrated. The largest sub-category (24%) is ‘other business services’ or OBS (Figure A3). Peeling off another layer of the onion the left panel of the figure shows the components of OBS. The largest categories are: professional and management consulting services (37% of OBS) and technical trade-related and other business services not elsewhere included. Disaggregated figures for the ‘technical trade-related and other business services not elsewhere’ category are not available for the whole world but some nations – like the US – provide more detail.

The right pie chart (which is based on US data since it includes a finer disaggregation than world data) shows the breakdown of ‘technical trade-related and other business services not elsewhere’. The big items are engineering services (38%); leasing services (19%); and other business services not included elsewhere (24%).

Evidence on trade in intermediate services

While official services-trade data fail to distinguish between final and intermediate services the OECD TiVA database does. Figure A4 shows that intermediates are more important in imported services than imported manufactures. For manufacturing intermediates account for about half and there has been some decline since 2008. For services the share starts out a bit higher and the gap widens.

Figure A4 Intermediates as share of imported services and manufactures 1995-2018 euro area 19 and UK (shares of own-sector imports 1995-2018)

Notes: TiVA data are only available for the 1995-2018 period. Imports in the charts are measured on the usual ‘gross’ basis (not value-added basis). Business services encompass all non-governmental services (the TiVA database categories of services do not line up with standard trade in services categories like OCS).

Why it matters: Sherry Rehman's suggestion made in an interview with the Guardian out Sunday comes as Pakistan has pleaded with the international community for an “immense humanitarian response” as it suffers from unprecedented flooding that has left more than 1250 people dead.

Scientists have blamed the unusual monsoon rains and flooding on climate change. Last week U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on the world to stop “sleepwalking” through the deadly crisis.

What they're saying: “There is so much loss and damage with so little reparations to countries that contributed so little to the world’s carbon footprint that obviously the bargain made between the global north and global south is not working"" Rehman said.

""We need to be pressing very hard for a reset of the targets because climate change is accelerating much faster than predicted on the ground that is very clear.”

The backdrop: World leaders at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow last year did not commit to an agreement to compensate developing nations for the damage they've sustained from global warming despite playing such a little role in causing it.

The idea — which has been referred to as ""loss and damage"" — is now on climate negotiations radar in a way it hadn't been previously writes Axios' Ben Geman.

Rehman also called on countries to ramp up their emissions targets in the face of a climate crisis that accelerated making catastrophes like the one in Pakistan all the more common.

“Global warming is the existential crisis facing the world and Pakistan is ground zero — yet we have contributed less than 1% to [greenhouse gas] emissions. We all know that the pledges made in multilateral forums have not been fulfilled” Rehman said.

The bottom line: “The whole area looks like an ocean with no horizon — nothing like this has been seen before” said Rehman of the flooding in Pakistan.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL2FmcmljYS5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2xvY2FsL21hcmtldHMva2VueWEtcmFua3MtZmlyc3QtaW4tdGhlLXVzZS1vZi1kaWdpdGFsLXBheW1lbnRzLWFjcm9zcy1hZnJpY2EtYWhlYWQtb2Ytc291dGgtYWZyaWNhL3BtMzVqMWXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kenya ranks first in the use of digital payments across Africa according to VISA,"The survey which global digital payments solution provider Visa published showed that an estimated (71%) of businesses in Kenya use cash as a means of payment compared to higher use of cash by businesses in South Africa (91%) and Nigeria (94%).

According to the study the less use of cash among Kenyan businesses is reflected in the high preference for mobile wallets (56 per cent) compared to Nigeria (14 per cent) and South Africa (7 per cent).

The study also highlighted that high usage of digital payments in Kenya was concentrated in food entertainment tours and accommodation agriculture transport and delivery and professional services sectors of the economy.

“Cash is the highest used option across all markets though relatively lower in Kenya. Mobile wallet payments are highest in usage as well as preference in Kenya. Usage of a personal account for business payment is also prevalent in Kenya. Bank transfer is widely used in Nigeria” the survey stated.

It added that 69 per cent of Kenyan businesses said digital payments (mobile money transfer card payment contactless cards and bank transfer) have positively impacted their business as they can easily track expenses and revenues enabling fast transactions and cutting on errors in change.

The adoption of mobile money payments in Kenya has been rising following the Central Bank’s push for the service in recent times. Last year during the pandemic the Kenyan government released a directive through the central bank instructing commercial banks and payment service providers to stop charges on all transfers from mobile money wallets and bank accounts.

According to Visa the impact of introducing digital payments for businesses is positive but the study shows room for improvement in adoption. The survey concluded that 83 per cent of respondents that adopted digital payments experienced an improvement in revenue. At the same time 55 per cent of business owners plan to increase investment in new technologies.

Fraud attempts in Africa have increased by more than 50% in the last two years according to a report

Meanwhile a new report has revealed that fraud attempts in Africa have increased by 50% in the last two years. The report published by popular KYC service Smile Identity found that the first half of 2022 alone saw a 30% increase over 2021.

According to the report there had been an increase in fraud attempts in countries like Kenya while a reduction was observed in Ghana and South Africa.

“In 2020 17% of all Smile Identity KYC checks were flagged as attempted fraud and in the first half of 2022 this number increased to 26%. For the foreseeable future as businesses adapt to the new virtual reality we expect to see more and new types of fraud emerge increasingly” the report stated.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vaXR3ZWIuYWZyaWNhL2NvbnRlbnQvbExuMTRNbVFqZEJNSjZBYdIBMWh0dHBzOi8vaXR3ZWIuYWZyaWNhL2FtcC9jb250ZW50L2xMbjE0TW1RamRCTUo2QWE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google Pay ready to compete for slice of SA’s bustling Fintech market,"Mobile payment service Google Pay has gone live in South Africa enabling in-app online and in-person contactless payments from Android mobile phones tablets or connected watches.

The development is expected to bump up tap-and-pay transactions in South Africa with global payments switch service MasterCard powering up Google Pay payments.

Google Pay enables users to transact with a virtual card number or token which according to Google means that a user’s financial information is kept safe.

Users of the new platform store their cards for Google Pay within Google Wallet a digital wallet that also recently launched in South Africa.

South Africa is considered a major market for contactless payments and according to MasterCard’s New Payments Index 52% of South African consumers have used smartphone and digital tap-and-pay platforms in the past year.

MasterCard stated: “This trend is set to continue with 60% of South African respondents saying they are likely to tap a smartphone to pay in the coming year with comfort and security key to growing adoption.”

Alistair Mokoena South Africa manager for Google said “Access to technology is vital for economic prosperity as millions of people use their mobile devices daily to tap-and-pay at stores pay for public transportation and to utilise a variety of passes. We want to make digital wallets accessible to everyone through fast secure access to their everyday essentials.”

Gabriel Swanepoel Southern Africa manager at MasterCard added: “We are excited to work with Google to deliver a payment experience that is both simple and secure in turn speeding the adoption of digital payments in South Africa.

Adrian Monck managing director of the WEF also argues that politicians espousing those theories should ask themselves whether they're spreading disinformation coming from bad actors.

""Canada should be talking about a lot of things right now. It shouldn't really be talking about the World Economic Forum based here in Geneva"" Monck told CBC Radio's The House in an interview airing Saturday. ""You know there are bigger issues really for it to be thinking about.""

In the course of the global COVID-19 pandemic the WEF has become a popular target for conspiracy theorists.

It began when an opinion article published in 2016 on the WEF's website — entitled "" Welcome to 2030. I own nothing have no privacy and life has never been better "" and intended its author says as ""a discussion about some of the pros and cons of the current technological development"" — started getting attention in 2020 after WEF founder and chairman Klaus Schwab wrote his own opinion piece arguing for something he called "" the great reset .""

These opinion pieces represent two of a number of diverse viewpoints the WEF commissions and publishes Monck said.

The ""great reset"" has since morphed into a conspiracy theory claiming that a cabal of global elites is planning to remake society to eliminate private property and impose an authoritarian global government.

Monck said the ""great reset"" is really just an idea that grew out of the pandemic when world governments were pouring billions of dollars into keeping the economy afloat.

""The idea was that we should also try and suggest to people that they think about spending it on the kind of long-term things that would aid climate change combating that would help jobs re-skilling and all the kinds of bigger long-term challenges"" he told Catherine Cullen host of CBC Radio's The House.

""One of the things our organization tries to do is say to people 'Look beyond the one week three months and think about maybe some of the longer term things you could be doing.' That was what the great reset was aimed to do back in the summer of 2020.""

Some Conservative MPs have been accused of spreading anti-WEF conspiracy theories. After Conservative MP Colin Carrie told the House of Commons in February that the WEF had ""penetrated more than half of Canada's cabinet"" he was accused of spreading disinformation by the NDP's Charlie Angus.

Other Conservatives take a different view. Michelle Rempel Garner MP for Calgary Nose Hill earlier this year wrote an opinion piece entitled ' I went to Davos. The World Economic Forum is not running Canada. '

""Concerns about 'the great reset' the World Economic Forum and the apparent plan to turn Canada into a communist state is one of the underlying conspiracy theories that motivated some of the protesters who have participated in the truckers protest recently disbanded in Ottawa"" she wrote. ""It is an increasingly mainstream assumption in Conservative circles.""

Monck said that during the pandemic the WEF became aware that it was being targeted by state-sponsored disinformation campaigns. He said the false conspiracy theory about the WEF pursuing a 'new world order' borrows its structure from old antisemitic claims about a Jewish plan for global domination.

""It really was something that was picked up by some state-sponsored disinformation actors and it took on a life of its own in some geographies"" Monck said.

""Sadly Canada was one of those places where ... there's a vulnerability to disinformation. It's an open society. And ... that particular strand of disinformation went into the mainstream.""

Monck said conspiracy theories about the ""great reset"" and the WEF are being driven by disinformation agents and politicians should consider where these theories are coming from before espousing them.

""I admire anyone who makes the decision to devote their lives to public life"" he said. ""It's not an easy road but I do think politicians of every single stamp need to look very hard at the language that they use and where some of this stuff comes from and if it's coming from a space of ... disinformation and in particular antisemitism.

""I think they need to have a very hard look at themselves and a very hard look in the mirror.""

We do not prescribe policy: Monck

Monck said the WEF does not prescribe policy but rather acts as a forum for exchanging ideas.

Still the forum has drawn some strong political criticism.

Last week Conservative leadership candidate Pierre Poilievre told a crowd of applauding supporters that as prime minister he would ban cabinet ministers from attending ""that big fancy conference of billionaires with the World Economic Forum"" and vowed to remove them from cabinet should they attend.

Listen: World Economic Forum's Adrian Monck speaks to The House:

CBC News: The House 15:27 World Economic Forum denounces conspiracy theories “poisoning” public debate Adrian Monck a managing director at the World Economic Forum discusses the origins of how his organization has become the target of widespread conspiracy theories.

The WEF hosts a conference in Davos Switzerland every January where business leaders and politicians from around the world gather to exchange ideas. Both Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and former prime minister Stephen Harper — who endorsed Poilievre for the Conservative leadership — have attended the conference twice.

When Harper attended the conference in 2012 he gave a speech describing the WEF as ""an indispensable part of the global conversation among leaders in politics business and civil society"" and said that ""in the face of continuing global economic instability the opportunity this gathering provides is now more valuable than ever.""

Monck said Poilievre's decision to paint the WEF as he has is confusing.

""I don't know where he differs in his analysis from say Stephen Harper"" he said. ""We're not an advocate on behalf of any particular political viewpoint. We try and remain impartial and neutral.

""We don't stand for big small middle-sized governments. We deal with governments of every single stripe ... so I don't really understand where that particular analysis is coming from.""

In a statement issued to CBC News Poilievre said the annual WEF meeting in Davos ""is a hypocritical gathering of billionaires multinationals and powerful politicians"" who ""lecture working class people to stop buying gasoline.""

""There is no apparent benefit to Canadians in being involved in it. Canadian taxpayers should not need to pay to send government leaders to attend such a meeting"" Poilievre said in the statement. ""Rather ministers should put their full attention to serving everyday people in Canadian communities.""

Danielle Smith a leading candidate to replace outgoing Alberta Premier Jason Kenney in the United Conservative Party leadership has also criticized the WEF. She described it as a group of ""anti-democratic elites"" who have been attacking Alberta for years and want Canadians to ""own nothing and be happy."""

Rangers GM Chris Young has caught his breath from one firing and picked up his jaw from another. Now he can start to focus on the next task: Making the hire that will likely define his tenure running the team.

“I guarantee you this” Young said Friday of the Rangers’ nascent managerial search. “We will hire somebody who values what we value most in where we are and where we are going.”

Advertisement

Exactly what that is though Young isn’t offering up much. All he’s indicated is that he seeks “balance.” Of presumably everything from old school feel to new school data-driven decisions from communicating with players on their level to demanding excellence without compromise.

The Rangers are just collecting names at this point Young said. And interim manager Tony Beasley’s is at the top. Connect whatever dots you’d like to add others. Young played for Bruce Bochy. He played with Boston bench coach Will Venable and just-named Team USA manager Mark DeRosa.

But know this: Managerial hiring operates as a pendulum that swings from authoritarian on one end to yielding on the other. When one manager is fired the pendulum usually swings closer to the other end with the hope of landing in the middle. Chris Woodward may have swung to the lenient side. If history is any guide the next manager will tip in the other direction.

Which brings us to this: Over the last 20 years the Rangers have hired four managers. It’s worth revisiting what they got right in those choices what they didn’t anticipate and what flaws ultimately sunk them. A guide:

Buck Showalter 2003

Buck Showalter (2003-2006) 319 wins 329 losses .492 winning percentage: The predecessor of the golden age of Rangers baseball never finished better than third and watched stellar free agents come and go during Tom Hicks' run as owner but he was the AL Manager of the Year in 2004. (Michael Ainsworth)

What they were seeking: Credibility and stability. With previous managerial stints in New York and Arizona Showalter had already taken two teams to the playoffs. Coming off consecutive 90-loss seasons and inheriting a lineup that featured Alex Rodriguez Rafael Palmeiro and the return of Juan Gonzalez the Rangers wanted a proven winner.

Advertisement

What they got: Ultimately Machiavelli. It didn’t take long for Showalter to determine the payroll was bloated with dead weight and that Rodriguez had way too much sway with ownership. So a passive-aggressive battle between the two set in ultimately won by the manager when Rodriguez was traded to the Yankees. Showalter was able to forge an us-against-the-world approach for the young group that remained. But he simply could not stop extending his reach. It led to bitterness in the clubhouse and politics in the front office.

Advertisement

What he lacked: The ability to pull back. There was little doubt Showalter was smart prepared and understood his players’ strengths and weaknesses. Perhaps burned by firings in New York and Arizona he continually tried to extend influence whether in the void left by a withdrawn GM (John Hart) or by manipulating a new and young one (Jon Daniels).

The lesson: Put bluntly the manager has to stay in his lane.

Ron Washington 2007

(Louis DeLuca/The Dallas Morning News) (Louis DeLuca)

What they were seeking: Passion positivity and potential. They wanted a manager who could grow alongside a young core they believed was on the verge of breaking through. They also felt they needed a breath of fresh air after four years under the heavy hand of Showalter. They weren’t so concerned with game-management minutiae as they were with setting a tone of what was achievable.

What they got: Though it took a bit of time — and trading Mark Teixeira — Washington ended up being pretty much exactly what the Rangers bargained for. He got players to play hard for him and got the best out of them which is about the highest praise a manager can receive. He had the most successful run as a manager in club history. Once he had a lineup he took a set-it-and-forget-it approach allowing players to settle into regular and definitive roles that set them up for success.

What he lacked: Game management was not considered Washington’s strength. Of course that really didn’t impact anything … until Game 6 of the World Series. But enough about that. He also managed as coaching staffs were evolving from old school to a new school approach with more definitive responsibilities for all coaches.

The lesson: With more data than ever to manage staff matters.

Jeff Banister 2015

What they were seeking: Clint Hurdle. Hurdle had left an impression on the Rangers from his time as a coach in 2010 and had just taken Pittsburgh to back-to-back playoff appearances. Hurdle had a big personality a big presence and had embraced data-driven decision-making. After Washington’s loose atmosphere the pendulum nudged back toward structure. In Banister Hurdle’s Pittsburgh bench coach at the time the Rangers got a tough-talking Texas-born version.

What they got: Banister talked tough occasionally dropped militaristic lingo such as “iron sharpens iron” and was more than ready for a little on-field scuffle (see the Rougned Odor 2016 decking of Jose Bautista). It proved the perfect touch for a team that had lost 95 games in 2014 and gotten down on itself. It’s also the kind of intense tightly wound approach that can have a short shelf life. It grinds on players. Alas Banister managed the Rangers to consecutive playoff berths in his first two years and was gone two years later.

Advertisement

What he lacked: Flexibility. It seemed like winning Manager of the Year in 2015 made him more rigid in his beliefs. After his first losing season when asked to soften some of his edges Banister couldn’t or wouldn’t. There were times he appeared to relish debate for the sport of it. He didn’t make it to the end of the next season.

The lesson: Managers must evolve. They’ve got to find ways to meet the needs of their players more than forcing them to adapt to the manager.

Chris Woodward 2019

What they were seeking: Communication collaboration data integration and a former player who could relate with the modern player. The perception was that Banister’s presence had been heavy so the Rangers wanted a lighter touch. They wanted to stress dialogue. And despite their attempts with the last hiring they felt they had fallen behind much of the game in deploying data.

What they got: A nice guy. Woodward brought energy and humility and an open-mindedness to attacking challenges and was the face of what had become a faceless organization. As for the latter he did all that with a relentlessly positive attitude. His tenure was crippled by the COVID pandemic season and by the full-scale rebuild that followed. In the end though he wasn’t able to instill the “championship culture” of which he spoke. The Rangers functioned more like a bunch of parts than a team.

What he lacked: Firmness. When he was fired management spoke of things that needed to be “tightened” up from meetings that could run too long and veer off in too many directions to on-field fundamentals which were sloppy.

The lesson: Modern-day managers may need to go further to reach players than in the past but there also have to be some fixed standards for accountability.

Sold off by the Boston Archdiocese during the consolidation of Catholic parishes the church building in Hyde Square was at one point slated to be converted to luxury condos. But that proposal wasn’t too popular in a neighborhood that like so many others in the city was under assault by skyrocketing housing prices threatening the diverse community that earned Hyde Square its nickname as Boston’s Latin Quarter.

For 18 years the majestic Blessed Sacrament church has stood empty an emblem of the long-running struggle to build housing in Boston.

Those close to the project say they’re excited to give the church a new two-pronged mission: to chip away at Boston’s housing crisis and lift up the neighborhood’s burgeoning Afro-Latino arts scene.

“We’re the only one that hasn’t been turned into luxury condos” said Cisnell Baez a Hyde Square Task Force alumna and longtime community organizer. “That’s the beautiful rich history of Jamaica Plain; our immigrant communities have had to fight a lot and knew they had to speak up.”

The century-old Italian Renaissance Revival-style Catholic church once served as an anchor for religious services cultural celebrations and local organizing for the neighborhood’s diverse communities. After the Archdiocese of Boston shuttered it in 2004 well-intentioned nonprofits tried to redevelop it with limited success.

The nonprofit Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Development Corp. and New Atlantic Development bought Blessed Sacrament’s three-acre campus from the archdiocese in 2005 and built around the church itself including a mix of luxury and affordable housing and what’s now the headquarters of the Hyde Square Task Force.

But the aging church remained untouched. Its owners proposed to convert the property into luxury condos but affordable housing advocates objected. In 2014 the Hyde Square Task Force purchased the site for $880000. The nonprofit had ambitious plans to transform the parish into a state-of-the-art performing arts center.

But weather and time took their toll on the old church and project costs kept climbing. Moreover the task force was carrying a $680000 mortgage on the property. Then last year the nonprofit sought proposals for the property hoping to find a redevelopment partner.

“Hyde Square Task Force is very good at youth and community development” said Mark Saperstein the nonprofit’s board president. “But development is not our expertise.”

Neighbors approached the nonprofit with recommendations for a collaborative community-centered selection process. A group of former parishioners community organizers and longtime residents with a shared interest in the church formed Friends of Blessed Sacrament. They collected scores of signatures and wrote letters in English and Spanish reiterating their opposition to luxury condos and asking the task force for community opinion to be incorporated into the final plan.

Among the collective is Harry Smith a Jamaica Plain resident and longtime community organizer. He recalled working with parish leadership when the church was open to expand affordable housing in the neighborhood and lifting up the area’s immigrant communities.

“The church has always been a focal point for community activities and community events” Smith said. “It’s only a natural legacy to keep the church functioning in that way.”

For other advocates including Cisnell Baez memories of being a Blessed Sacrament parishioner inspired them to join the community engagement process.

“I went there every Sunday I had my first Communion there and I took classes at the Cheverus Building” she said. “Everyone was super super sad to see such a beautiful temple close down.”

After hearing pitches from developers at several community meetings Hyde Square Task Force selected Pennrose which offered the most affordable housing units and to incorporate community space into its proposal. The developer is also working to transform the former William Barton Rogers School in Hyde Park into New England’s first LGBTQ+-friendly senior housing development.

Pennrose has a purchase option agreement with the task force and submitted a letter of intent to the Boston Planning and Development Agency in late August.

“We found a solution that’s a win-win on all levels” said Celina Miranda Hyde Square Task Force’s executive director. “I can’t wait to see those doors open.”

Charlie Adams Pennrose regional vice president was unable to give an estimate of the project’s cost but said the company is working to address the community’s needs while maintaining the church’s integrity.

“Resources are always tight but the city and the state are doing whatever they can to help us figure out how to manage through” Adams said.

Pennrose’s proposal includes more than 50 housing units. Roughly 60 percent of these units would be reserved for households making at most 60 percent of the Area Median Income or $84120 for a family of four according to the letter of intent.

Moreover 13 percent of these units would go to families making 30 percent or less of median income as required by local and state law.

The affordable units will be a small but important contribution to the city’s efforts to address its affordable housing said Sheila Dillon Boston’s housing chief.

“This is a solution to the gentrification that’s happening in Jamaica Plain” Dillon said. “Not a reason for it to get worse.”

Dillon said the city will continue to work with Pennrose during the approval process to push for as much affordability as possible.

Another source of excitement for supporters of Blessed Sacrament: Part of the church will remain community space a performance and meeting space that can accommodate up to 250 people.

“There’ll be history of the Latinx community a touch of beautiful activism and celebrations year-round” Baez said. “You’re always going to come back.”

A long road still lies ahead. Adams said construction could begin by the end of 2023 if Pennrose secures financing for the project soon. The developer is eyeing the city’s $50 million fund available to affordable housing applicants and state funding as potential sources he said.

The Boston Landmarks Commission is also considering whether to designate the Blessed Sacrament complex as a historical landmark. Residents first petitioned the city to make that designation in 2005 but their request has taken on renewed urgency as the redevelopment plans take shape. A historical landmark designation protects a piece of the community’s history into the future though in the short term it could add construction requirements that make the redevelopment process more difficult and expensive.

But residents say they’re willing to wait — and they’re especially excited about that performance space since such community venues are in short supply in Jamaica Plain.

“Sometimes it seems like there’s nothing you can do with these churches” Adams said. “But we’ve learned there are greater possibilities than people may think.”

Lange is still getting whiffs when he throws his nasty curveball but for the first time this season opponents are making consistent contact with his premier pitch. The month of August has been especially troubling.

Entering Saturday Lange had given up five runs in two innings combined over his past two outings. The Texas Rangers scored three runs against him last Sunday at Globe Life Field and the Seattle Mariners scored twice Wednesday at Comerica Park.

Before the All-Star break Lange posted a 2.04 ERA in 35⅓ innings (39 games).

""The execution has been a little bit off"" Hinch said. ""He's been pretty erratic lately. Part of that is the league knows he's going to throw 60-70% breaking balls. They're going up anticipating that. It doesn't make it easier or harder but execution becomes a little bit more of a priority.""

Texas' Kole Calhoun crushed a home run on a sinker. Lange tried to throw the pitch inside but it leaked over the middle of the plate. On Wednesday Seattle's Adam Frazier and Abraham Toro showcased extra-base power against Lange's curveball.

Frazier tripled and on the next pitch Toro homered to put the Mariners ahead 4-3 in the seventh inning of an eventual 5-3 victory.

""The breaking ball that got hit for a homer was on the bottom line of the zone just a little middle"" Lange said. ""The guy was sitting on it and made a good swing. I've been playing against that guy since A-ball. He was sitting on a breaking ball and got to it.""

This season Lange's pitch mix has been comprised of 50.3% curveballs 27.9% sinkers 18.4% changeups and 3.4% four-seam fastballs. His curveball registered a .091 opponent batting average and 62.7% whiff rate in July.

In August his curve brought a .313 batting average and 60.6% whiff rate.

""This league comes down to executing"" Lange said. ""When you don't execute you get hurt. That's what happens. Coming in late in the ballgame coming in for the hold you don't execute then you get hit and give up the game and cost your team a win. I'm trying to keep these boys in the ballgame. We've been battling all year. Just got to continue to refine and continue to get better.""

An unexpected WBC allegiance

Lange who played for the USA Collegiate National Team in 2016 has committed to compete for Puerto Rico in the 2023 World Baseball Classic scheduled for March 8-21. His mother Renee is Puerto Rican.

""My grandmother was born over there"" Lange said. ""We just got to get the birth certificate and proof of all that stuff (to the Puerto Rican Baseball Federation). I'm just trying to figure it all out.""

The 26-year-old became interested in playing for Puerto Rico in 2020 upon meeting Tigers assistant pitching coach Juan Nieves. Then the Puerto Rican Baseball Federation invited Lange to participate in the 2023 WBC.

Lange is excited to play alongside infielders Carlos Correa (Minnesota Twins) Francisco Lindor (New York Mets) and Javier Báez (Tigers). Tigers reliever Joe Jiménez pitched for Team Puerto Rico in the 2017 WBC but hasn't committed for 2023.

""It's a deep team"" Lange said. ""I think (George) Springer committed as well. It's going to be fun. It's a pretty deep team so obviously it's a super unique opportunity. Playing for something more than yourself sounds pretty cool.""

Miguel Cabrera's health

Designated hitter Miguel Cabrera met with a doctor late Saturday afternoon for an examination on his left bicep. The 39-year-old suffered the injury on a swinging strikeout in the fifth inning of Friday's 5-4 win over the Kansas City Royals.

""We'll have a little more answers later"" Hinch said. ""He feels better whatever that's worth at this point. But we'll have to get him evaluated.""

A ruptured left bicep tendon in June 2018 ended Cabrera's season. The injury sustained on a swing required surgery. This time Cabrera hurt a different part of his bicep.

Cabrera a 20-year MLB veteran is batting .256 with four home runs 25 walks and 94 strikeouts in 102 games. Since July 28 Cabrera has a .088 batting average and .148 on-base percentage over 17 games.

Hinch does not want Cabrera to step away from the team.

""He should play if he can play"" he said.

Schoop begins rehab assignment

Second baseman Jonathan Schoop began a rehab assignment Saturday with High-A West Michigan. He is recovering from a right ankle sprain and has been on the injured list since Aug. 23 retroactive to Aug. 21.

Schoop served as the Whitecaps' second baseman Saturday. He will play Sunday and after Monday's off day he will join Triple-A Toledo.

""He'll continue to play with them"" Hinch said. ""I don't know the schedule exactly but he's working his way back. He'll have to do some things before he comes back. Maybe maybe not on the road trip (Sept. 5-11). I know he wants to come back but we're certainly looking forward to get him on the field.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ib3N0b25nbG9iZS9uYW1lL3NhdWwtc2xhcGlrb2ZmLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2NDEwNTM30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SAUL SLAPIKOFF Obituary (1931 - 2022) - Cambridge MA - Boston Globe,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/bostonglobe/name/saul-slapikoff-obituary?id=36410537 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9ib3N0b25nbG9iZS9uYW1lL3NhdWwtc2xhcGlrb2ZmLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2NDEwNTM30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBvcnR1Z2FsbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLTA5LTA0L3NhdGEtam9pbnMtZ2xvYmFsLW1vdmVtZW50LXRvLWNvbnNlcnZlLXNoYXJrLWxpZmUvNzAwMTHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SATA joins global movement to conserve shark life,"The SATA group has joined the global movement to conserve shark life by introducing a ban on the transport of fins of these species or other cartilaginous fish parts on all its flights it was announced on 2 September.

By TPN/Lusa in Environment Sustainability  Madeira & Azores · 04 Sep 2022 17:01 · 2 Comments

In a statement sent to the media the Azorean airline explains that the measure applies to all flights operated by SATA Air Açores responsible for air connections between the nine islands and Azores Airlines with connections outside the archipelago.

The companies ""have joined through the 'Fly Without Fins' movement a group of international organisations for the conservation of marine life and the defence of animal welfare"" says the airline.

“Fly Without Fins"" is an animal protection initiative involving several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) committed to the conservation of animal life in order to prevent ""acts of cruelty to animals and combat the sale of shark fins and other cartilaginous fish parts"" explains SATA.

The initiative includes associations such as Shark Guardian Sciaena Sea Shepherd Sharkproject MarViva Gallifrey Foundation Oceanic Preservation Society Shark Allies and Sharks Education Institute.

Although 'finning' (the name given to cutting the fins of sharks and rays and then discarding the bodies into the oceans) is not a practice identified in the Azores archipelago (the destination most operated by SATA) nor have the two airlines been confronted with this issue to date the company maintains that the transport ban ""may help reinforce the global message in defence of safeguarding marine life and contributes to the efforts that have been undertaken at international level"".

The chairman of the SATA group Luís Rodrigues considers that the commitment now made represents ""another step in the implementation of a corporate policy"" attentive ""to environmental issues and committed to a sustainable future"".

""Although the Azores is an internationally recognised sustainable destination in which there is responsibility and awareness regarding sustainable fishing and preservation of the seas our airlines fly to varied destinations and we want to make our contribution in the collective effort [to] dissuade a cruel practice which is a threat to the species and which does not contribute to the balance of the different natural habitats"" reinforces the head.

Alex Hofford a spokesperson for the ""Fly without Fins"" initiative says quoted in the note that he is grateful for the SATA group's entry into this ""important movement"".

""The commercialisation of shark fins has led to intensive shark fishing and has meant that a third of the species is now endangered. If we want to counter the trend before it is too late we must act now"" he warned.

Alex Hofford called on airlines to implement measures to ban such transport especially of Atlantic blue shark and mako shark fins ""the most traded species""."

Sarah Friar chief executive of Nextdoor Holdings takes a somewhat Pollyannaish view of how the neighborhood social networking platform will fare during the next downturn.

“Nextdoor is still really well positioned to continue to show growth even in an outright recession” Friar says. People come to the platform during tough times such as COVID-19 because it aims “to cultivate a kinder world where everyone has a neighborhood to rely on’’ she explains. The first-time CEO took Nextdoor public via a special purpose acquisition company—or SPAC—in November 2021 with the ticker symbol KIND which she devised.

Friar sounds remarkably upbeat even though her employer last month lowered its expected full-year revenue amid uncertain advertising demand. Nextdoor makes money from ads and sponsored content. Nearly one in three U.S. households uses the free app to find plumbers sell stuff or complain about neighbors. But rivals like Meta Platforms’ Facebook are far bigger.

Friar a 49-year-old native of Northern Ireland holds master’s degrees from the University of Oxford and Stanford University. She assumed command of San Francisco-based Nextdoor in 2018 following stints as a McKinsey management consultant Goldman Sachs software analyst and finance executive for Salesforce and Square.

Heeding criticism Friar has pushed to remove racist and other toxic content from Nextdoor. Her effort represents “a promising solution for any social media company struggling with toxicity’’ wrote TIME’s Alison Van Houten in ranking Nextdoor among the 100 most influential companies for 2022.

Friar recently spoke to TIME about her strategies to curb toxic content Nextdoor’s depressed share price its international expansion strategy and persistent gender bias in America.

This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

Why won’t your revenue growth spurt come to a screeching halt if the economy sours in 2023?

All our competitors in the digital ad space recently took down their forecasts. We’re still doing quite well comparatively because we’re bringing something unique to advertisers. We reach over 75 million neighbors across 11 countries. We’ve [also] taken time to confirm we only have real neighbors.

Why did Nextdoor introduce two more features this spring to mitigate implicit bias and promote kinder conversations? A system you launched last year scans posts for red flags and encourages users to reconsider before publishing something problematic. Plus your Kindness Reminder already nudges users if it sees signs of a heated conversation such as negative language.

The amount of platform content reported for harmful reasons is tiny. It was 0.34% in 2021. But there’s always more we could or should do. Sadly the work of being a welcoming platform is never done.

We’re now doing a bit more work around the platform’s commercial intent. We would like to help businesses figure out better ways to engage their community so it doesn’t feel like you’re trying to sell me something all the time. Someone posting ‘$10 off the next window cleaning’ five times a day for example can be toxic if it feels really spammy.

Do your competitors adequately manage their toxic content?

We would love to see the industry do more of what we’re doing. They should be willing to slow people down to create more welcoming spaces—even if it disrupts engagement. We’ve seen people following in our footsteps with features similar to the Kindness Reminder.

Nextdoor investors don’t seem impressed by your strides at improving civilized discourse online however. Your share price has hovered far below the $13.01 level seen when Nextdoor went public. How soon might your plan to repurchase up to $100 million of shares revive your depressed stock price?

Our share price has performed slightly better than most other peers. The stock repurchase is a signal to the market that we think our stock price is way undervalued. It’s quite a good business decision to buy back stock in the $3-to-$4-a-share range. It will help the share price because it will remove shares from the earnings-per-share calculation. Assuming the market is rational we will have higher earnings per share with a smaller share count.

Nextdoor is growing faster abroad than in the U.S. How many countries will you operate in by 2032? And when will the company be a worldwide player?

We have to be in more than just 11 countries. Our goal is to be a worldwide player though I’m not prepared to put a date on it. Making the platform more global is a great way to continue to show growth.

We launched in Canada our latest country about two years ago. We have a playbook to pick countries that gets better every time. Scale matters. So do countries where digital phones are already quite penetrated. The third thing we look for is a predisposition toward community. Fourth is digital ad spend because that’s our monetization engine.

More than 30000 small and midsize businesses advertise on your platform. How will you attract more such businesses?

We have a very thriving ecosystem with them. We’ve seen about 55 million business recommendations from Nextdoor neighbors. We’ve also had about 3.4 million small and midsize businesses claim a free business page on Nextdoor. They can then grow further through Nextdoor ads.

Awareness is the limit right now. Some businesses don’t yet know that Nextdoor is for business. We need to help them understand that we might be their perfect way to advertise—and make it seamless to get more customers. They want to understand performance. Our new ad platform for example gives them a dashboard so they can actually see the performance.

What’s the best leadership advice you’ve gotten from more experienced chief executives who have mentored you?

Build something that has real scale. Don’t get caught in iterations. Think about the biggest needle movers you can spend time on rather than getting stuck in too many weeds.

Describe a potential Nextdoor move you skipped because you realized it would only be a baby step.

For a long time we wanted to get into the barter idea within our For Sale & Free marketplace. But about two years ago we pulled back. I said ‘Strategically we need to stick to the big things. We need to have an ad platform that’s fully functioning for instance.’ Focus and discipline are particularly important in a business like Nextdoor where you could probably do anything because most things have a local spin to them.

Should public company CEOs be outspoken advocates of social change? You experienced wrenching upheaval growing up in Northern Ireland during its protracted religious conflict and later residing in South Africa as apartheid ended.

More CEOs are being asked to think much more broadly about stakeholder value partly because you’re seeing trust go down in government the media and other elements. With my life I want to work on things that can have a societal impact and not just be in business for cold hard dollars. I grew up knowing that a small group of people is the only thing that ever has changed the world.

But you have to be very careful. If you stand for everything you stand for nothing. We have a very clear framework at Nextdoor to determine which social issues we engage in as a company. It depends on whether this issue aligns with our purpose mission and core values. It’s also not helpful to be the squawky voice if you have absolutely no ability to influence. The third step involves assessing whether our users are directly impacted. We’ve taken a stand on issues such as tightening federal gun control laws.

You believe sunlight is the best disinfectant and that’s why you share board materials with all Nextdoor staffers ahead of board meetings. Why should more corporate chiefs take this transparent approach?

Leading with transparency and empathy are probably the two best leadership traits you can exhibit as a public company CEO. Transparency takes away a lot of fear that employees often have.

Within the confines of being a public company and mindful of material non-public information we share everything. It can be so easy for employees to get caught in silos and become experts in a very niche area. Forced to read broadly they can pattern recognize. Broad knowledge sharing will breed great ideas.

At the same time trust is our core value. You have to show you are leading from the front on trust if you really want that to become part of your culture.

You recently said there are a lot of mediocre men in the business world but ‘ there’s no room for mediocre women.’ Why are you and other U.S. female executives still held to a higher standard than their male counterparts?

There’s still a lot of inherent implicit bias in the system. Statistics prove it. Female founders secured only 2% of venture capital in the United States in 2021. That’s the smallest share since 2016. And 2021 was the second year in a row that women’s percentage of venture capital funding shrunk. I am part of that group of women trying to raise capital. I’ve raised a lot of money in my life whether it was with Square or now with Nextdoor.

We are going backward. How can this be happening? It would be great if we could get more blind reviews of founders’ pitch decks like big orchestras [do with auditions]. Meanwhile women executives must work harder better and ultimately do more than the majority of the business community—which is white straight men.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzFkZjExMjUwLTY1MmMtNDQzZC04MmUzLTUzYjQ3YWJkY2U0ZtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Further reading,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

Voices and Orchestra Edusei – a thrilling fiercely rational Beethoven 9,"This is of course not just one of Beethoven’s most famous works it is one of his most famously difficult; Donald Tovey called it “a law unto itself” while musicologist Nicholas Cook has written eloquently on its “diametrically opposed interpretations”. After its first shambolic performances during Beethoven’s lifetime it took decades for its reputation to recover – now it’s so familiar the challenge is to deliver an account that feels as deftly original as it is authoritative.

The symphony also of course bears the scars of the ideological battles that have been fought over it throughout the generations. Now the ""Ode to Joy"" is the European Union’s anthem. Yet the Nazis’ attempt to appropriate it remains infamous and it’s perhaps even more relevant to the Chineke! interpretation that the rulers of the former apartheid regime of Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) also claimed it as their own in the Seventies. Within seven short years the Chineke! Orchestra has established such a reputation for the dynamism and quality of its performances that it’s difficult to remember when it was a rarity to see black and ethnically diverse performers in mainstream classical venues. Yet even in an apparently much more tolerant society than the brutal Zimbabwe/Rhodesia regime we have a lot of catching up to do and to hear this orchestra give this mesmerising account of Beethoven 9 feels in its own way like a turning point.

German/Ghanaian conductor Kevin John Edusai has carved out a reputation for identifying the architecture of each piece he conducts and revealing it in all its shimmering articulated glory. Beethoven 9 is at certain points so formally experimental that the danger is for it to sound chaotic and muddy. Here however there was never any sense of stumbling intent – if there was a criticism it was that sometimes it sounded almost too efficient. Yet that crystalline clarity really paid off especially in the third movement where it was possible to hear influences ranging from Beethoven’s own ""Pathétique"" sonata to Mozart’s Serenade for 13 Wind Instruments.

The evening opened with a performance of George Walker’s Lilacs which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1996. This setting of Walt Whitman’s elegy in memory of Abraham Lincoln forms an interesting textual companion to Schiller’s Ode to Joy; both take profound political emotions and elevate them into an expression of the sublime. The performance introduced the celebrated American soprano Nicole Cabell (pictured above on the left) whose ravishing sonorous voice swooped in counterpoint to Walker’s shivering jagged orchestration. It was an arresting opening to an evening that would prove as notable for its musical elegance as its richness.

After the agile account of Beethoven’s first movement which built to thunderstorm intensity in the final bars the orchestra moved to a tightly controlled molto vivace. This is the movement in which Beethoven the revolutionary painted with silence as much as with noise and Edusai’s rigorous definition paid off handsomely here. The melodic use of the drums – which would inspire composers from Berlioz to Stravinsky – was effectively and quite literally highlighted by placing the drummer separately from the rest of the percussion above the orchestra (pictured below). The tenterhook spikiness of the strings was offset by the rich lyricism of the woodwind passages. As with the first movement there were moments when it felt a little too exact a little more about the rationalism of the Enlightenment than the thrilling insights. Yet in the third movement any doubts fell away. In this extraordinary adagio there were moments when it almost felt as if you were being given a window into Beethoven’s mind watching the different musical ideas unfurl and interact. What could have come across as diffuse and fragmented was instead revealed as a rich mosaic of sound from a man burning to express the complexity of his world.

Like an actor grappling with ""To be or not to be"" in the fourth movement the musicians must spend as much time avoiding cliché as excavating nuance and this sophisticated interpretation did just that. Edusai built up the layers like a geometric puzzle so the themes glittered and refracted. Bass-baritone Ryan Speedo Green delivered a compelling opening to the dialogue before the choir Chineke! Voices made the Royal Albert Hall dome and auditorium resonate with the iconic harmonies. The deceptively effortless reach of Cabell’s voice made its mark here with assured support from mezzo Raehann Bryce Davis and tenor Zwakele Tshabalala.

There were some fragile moments – including a couple of bars where the sopranos sounded slightly sharp – yet ultimately this performance demonstrated the stupendousness of Beethoven’s achievement: the fight between rationality and madness the multiplicity of musical ideas the reaching from a stormily imperfect world into a more exalted dimension. Cook talked about the symphony being ""a construction of mirrors reflecting and refracting the values hopes and fears of those who seek to understand and explain it"". At a time of epic geopolitical and climatic turbulence last night Edusai revealed it yet again as a symphony for our times.",,,,,,

By Paul Palmer

The new season brings many changes to this year’s Hall High football team. They will now be known as the Titans after the West Hartford Board of Education voted in June on new nicknames at Hall and Conard eliminating any remaining association with Native American imagery.

On the field coach Frank Robinson is dealing with a young group of players having lost 27 seniors from last year’s 9-2 team that made it to the Class LL Quarterfinals.

The 2022 edition of the Titans returns fewer than 10 starters from last year’s team and faces one of the toughest schedules the team has had in years. They open with Fairfield Ludlowe at home this Thursday but then go on the road at Southington Ridgefield and Maloney. “It is one of the most challenging schedules in my tenure” said Robinson now in his 17th season.

On the offensive side of the ball junior Bode Smith will be the starting quarterback replacing departed senior Elijah Salomons. His coach says that while Smith did get some reps last year in games he will be learning as he goes.

Another big hold that will need to be filled is at running back. With the departure of All-State Leo Perreira who is now at Franklin Pierce College Hall needs to find a way to replace his nearly 1200 hundred rushing yards and 21 touchdowns from a season ago. The team does return senior wide receiver Angelo Culmo who had 452 yards and 6 touchdowns last season.

Robinson believes the success will start upfront with some of his returning players. “Our returning lineman Max Jewett and others it will be huge that they perform. If we can run the ball like we did last year we can be in games.”

Senior nose guard Eric Diaz and linebacker Hudson Hollander will anchor the defense along with Grant Kanaga. “We have to be ready from the get-go” Robinson said . “The expectation is we need to be ready to go.”

Robinson also knows that losing 27 seniors means losing team leaders but he believes the spirit is already there. “We have leadership from our seniors and we need them all to do it. It oozes down to the juniors from there” said Robinson.

It is a tough task replacing all the lost leaders and seniors from a season ago and Robinson knows that one of the keys will be setting the right attitude early. “The success last year didn’t just happen. They worked their tails off and did not cut any corners. This year we can’t think we will be good just because we were last year.”

Beyond the obvious heavy-hitters like Transformers and ThunderCats toy stores saw the likes of The Bone Age and Sectaurs. That last one now looks like the latest to revive. The Nacelle Company who produced The Toys That Made Us are now moving into the business of actually selling new versions of the figures that make them. In this case Sectaurs with two figures now available for preorder.

One of several fantasy/sci-fi hybrid lines to pop up in the wake of Masters of the Universe Coleco’s Sectaurs depicted insect- and arachnid-themed warriors. For the line’s main gimmick giant bug hand puppets with motorized wings could carry the figures on their backs. And the Hyve playset was one of the largest base sets of the decade. Adding some prestige a Marvel comics miniseries written by Bill Mantlo expanded on the Sectaurs storyline.

The new figures in 7-inch scale like the originals kick off with good-guy leader Prince Dargon and the previously unreleased-but-prototyped Stelara. Both should arrive in 2023 and cost $39.99 apiece.

This is actually the second Sectaurs revival — Zica Toys previously Kickstartered a 4-inch line. The bonus of The Nacelle Company’s versions is they’ll work with ’80s Sectaurs figures and playsets for anyone who still has them. Take look through the mini-gallery below for images.

Will you build a new hive (or Hyve) with these Sectaurs? Let us know in comments!

The following two figures are part of the Gaming Greats line which means they’ll be GameStop exclusives (hooray) and carry the exclusive $27.99 price tag (bleh). They’ll both be available for preorder on September 15 at 11:00 AM EST with expected arrival in Spring 2023.

Battle Droid (Republic Commando)

You won’t find many folks who are hardcore fans of the basic Battle Droid except for the army building them as background scenery. That being said this version of the droid from the Star Wars: Republic Commando video game looks pretty great — especially the off-white color scheme and weather.

That still doesn’t justify charging $27.99 for a figure with just one accessory though.

Rocket Launcher Trooper (Jedi: Fall Order)

Based on one of the stormtrooper models from the Jedi: Fallen Order video game series this figure comes with only one accessory. Thankfully it’s a really big one. If you’re a fan of stormtroopers and/or like army building them it’s going to be hard to resist adding this one to your collection.

Chocolate maker creates scare,"Children and candy lovers received a scare over the summer when news broke that there might be more tricks than treats this Halloween season but thanks to a steady sugar industry and the apparent changing tones of a chocolatier the holiday might be able to occur uninterrupted after all.

During a July earnings call Hershey CEO Michele Buck told company leaders that the candymaker might not have been able to meet consumer demand through the busy fall season.

""Seasonal consumer engagement is expected to remain high and we expect high single-digit sales growth for both our Halloween and Holiday seasons. Despite this strong growth we will not be able to fully meet consumer demand due to capacity constraints"" Buck said.

The news of the possibility that Hershey’s Reese’s Twizzlers and other popular brands may not greet some trick-or-treaters at doorsteps went worldwide.

The thought of a Halloween without an endless supply of candy was scarier than some haunted houses but some industry insiders cautioned the news might be less dire than the company’s original remarks.

US SEES FIRST FALL COLORS OF 2022 FOLIAGE SEASON

Despite questions on the availability of the season's candy a spokesperson for America's largest sugar producers assured FOX Weather that if there are production shortages they won't be created from a lack of the essential ingredient.

The growing of sugarbeets and sugarcane is highly dependent on the weather but the American Sugar Alliance said recent extreme events have not significantly impacted production.

""Despite some challenges such as drought in Texas where sugarcane is grown and late planting of sugarbeets in the upper Midwest due to cold and wet weather this year’s crop is looking good and is currently forecast to be larger than last year. Ultimately we won’t know what the final crop will be until all the harvests are completed"" said Rob Johansson director of economics & policy analysis at the American Sugar Alliance.

Drought Tracker





With more than 60 percent of the country facing drought conditions farmers of various crops and livestock have been hard hit but most of the main production belts for sugar have escaped drastic impacts.

The U.S. is one of the world’s largest sugar producers with sugarcane accounting for around 45 percent of domestic sugar and sugarbeets leading to 55 percent of production according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Experts say sugarcane grows in climates that are more tropical and are a commonly found along the Gulf Coast while sugarbeets tend to do better in a more temperate climate with less rainfall and cooler air.

HOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER ON TV

With no apparent issues with sugar production what caused Hershey to ring the alarm?

Well we may never know but recent statements by the company are positive for trick-or-treaters. Last month the candy company clarified its remarks and said there should be product for everyone.

""We actually have even more seasonal product available to the consumer this year than last year"" a Hershey spokesperson told FOX TV Stations.

After going into halftime with a deficit a week ago the Stars got off to a quicker start and held a 24-7 lead at the end of two quarters. The team maintained its lead in the second half milking the clock and adding on an additional score as well.

“We started to gradually get better and respond the way we wanted to respond but it took us a while” said KCHS coach Rashawn Harvey. “In the game of football when you get that momentum and you can ride it and keep it then that’ll work wonders for you. It showed tonight when we got the momentum things worked well for us.”

Kearney Catholic’s first points came with 2:06 remaining in the first quarter. On a third-and-8 from their own 24-yard line the Stars struck big with quarterback Carson Murphy finding a wide-open Owen Axmann for a 76-yard touchdown.

Hershey moved the ball offensively in the first quarter but two Kearney Catholic fourth-down stops held them scoreless.

After KCHS took a 10-0 lead off of a Solomon Wiens field goal at the start of the second quarter the Panthers gained some momentum on their third drive. Cooper Hill converted two passes of 20-plus yards and finished the drive with a 2-yard touchdown pass to Cole Schwager.

With only a 3-point lead the Stars ended a strong first half. With 2:01 remaining Brant Christner caught a screen pass and ran it 15 yards into the end zone for a 17-7 lead.

The Stars weren’t done as they forced an immediate three-and-out getting the ball back at the Panthers’ 48. That led to another touchdown with only five seconds left.

The Stars milked the clock for the majority of the second half while also adding on another touchdown for good measure. Murphy kept the ball for a 36-yard run to the 1-yard line and then brought their total to 31 with a 1-yard touchdown pass to Isaiah Gaunt.

“I think it was kind of a repeat of last week” Harvey said. “We gave up a touchdown in the first half and then didn’t give up any in the second. This week was basically a repeat. It ended up being a bend-but-don’t-break game.”

Heading into its next matchup at Minden KCHS wants to tighten up on both sides of the ball and play with more discipline.

“We played undisciplined a lot in this game but some of our athleticism and some of the mistakes by them kept us in the game” Harvey said. “For us and this group we have got to play with discipline because we’ve got a better team next week in Minden.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2RyZXhlbC5lZHUvbWVkaWNpbmUvYWNhZGVtaWNzL2dyYWR1YXRlLXNjaG9vbC9odW1hbi1sYWN0YXRpb24tY29uc3VsdGFudC1jZXJ0aWZpY2F0aW9uL3N0dWRlbnRzLWFuZC1hbHVtbmkvcmViZWNjYS13YWxrZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet Beckie Walker: Drexel Human Lactation Consultant Certification Alum - College of Medicine,"Beckie was part of the very first cohort for the Human Lactation Consultant Certification program.

For students out of the area we work closely with the prospective student to find a site with high-quality IBCLCs to direct and teach them.

Hometown: Hershey Pennsylvania

Undergraduate: Drexel University – BS in Nursing Addictions Counseling minor Human Lactation Consultant Certification

Graduate: Georgetown University – MS in Nursing Certified Nurse-Midwifery/Women's Health Nurse Practitioner Dual Program

Can you tell me a little bit about yourself before you came to Drexel?

I came to Drexel in 2010 right after graduating high school so really became an adult while attending Drexel as an undergraduate nursing student.

What drew you to the Human Lactation Certificate program and to Drexel specifically?

I came to Drexel because my brother went here and when I visited I felt right at home. I knew when entering nursing school I wanted to do something with women's health/reproductive health. My goal was to become a midwife and so when the Human Lactation program became available my junior year I jumped at the chance. I utilized my elective course requirement to do the lactation courses without having to pay more than my standard tuition so it was really a win-win. I am extremely passionate about helping all parents who wish to provide human milk to their child to be able to. I'm also passionate about increasing the awareness and access to education regarding lactation/breastfeeding/chest feeding to both health care professionals and parents in my community.

What did a typical day in your program look like? What is something unique about your experience in the program?

Oooh this is a blur. I attended Drexel from 2010-2015 and was extremely involved. I look back and think ""How in the heck did I do all that I did?"" When I took the lactation classes on the Center City Campus it wasn't much different than taking my regular courses but when I started clinical I had both nursing clinical one time per week and anywhere from two to three clinical days for lactation. I also attending nursing courses had a work study in the simulation lab on the Center City Campus and worked at both HUP and CHOP my senior year. It was super busy but I loved all of the opportunities I was able to experience.

What have you been doing since you completed the program? How did your time here prepare you for your work today?

Since graduating the program I continued to live in Philly and work at CHOP as a nurse (2015-2018) and Lankenau as an IBCLC (2016-2018). I also started a private practice lactation business where I did home visits to parents in need in the Philadelphia area. After I had my daughter in 2018 I started working at HUP on their postpartum unit (2018-2020) and continued doing home visits when I could. I started graduate school at Georgetown University in 2019 in their WHNP/CNM dual program. I moved to Northern Virginia for my partner's job in 2020 and currently work as a postpartum nurse there part time while I finish up clinical for my graduate program. I have about three more weeks to go and will graduate in May from Georgetown! I plan to work as a CNM/WHNP and start doing lactation visits again!

What advice would you give incoming students in your Drexel program?

I would encourage students to start studying for their certification exam ASAP and take a review class if they can! I think I struggled to study as much as I wanted to because I had so much going on. Additionally not sure if Drexel handles their clinical sites but I encourage students to be sure to think about their clinical sites and network with local IBCLCs to ease the process of getting their hours.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vc3Rvcmllcy5oZXJzaGV5cGEuY29tL3pvb2FtZXJpY2EtcmVjb2duaXplcy1uYXRpb25hbC13aWxkbGlmZS1kYXktMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ZooAmerica Recognizes National Wildlife Day 2022,"There is no better place to spend National Wildlife Day on Sept. 4 2022 than ZooAmerica.

When guests returned hotel owners liked their lower costs and didn’t want to bring back full housekeeping. But it’s something that guests expect.

Hilton’s CEO defends not offering full housekeeping. He’s said “When you’re at home do you change your sheets every day? Do you wash your towels every day? … No.” But hotel stays aren’t the same as being at home if they were you’d just book an Airbnb.

The middle ground chains have largely landed on is bringing back the option of housekeeping rather than making it something every hotel has to do every day. And many guests won’t proactively request it.

Some chains are even making daily housekeeping the default again. At least in theory.

Marriott even offers the opt-in or out of housekeeping as a radio button choice when making your reservation on their website for U.S. and Canada properties. Not in my experience any hotel ever looks at – let alone acts on – these preferences. Still housekeeping is supposed to be standard.

Daily cleaning is now standard at all premium-tier properties for stays of two nights or more and every other day cleaning at select service and extended stay brands for stays of three nights or more. Obviously rooms will be cleaned between guests for stays of shorter lengths. If you do not want daily or every other day cleaning you must opt out.

That may not be how things work in practice and the housekeeping you receive may not be the housekeeping you’ve come to expect .

Marriott’s Westin Annapolis is clear that you can have the choice for housekeeping and they’ve even brought back ‘Make a Green Choice’ to discourage the housekeeping expense – albeit the current version is a lot less generous than Starwood’s used to be. But read a little closer to see what housekeeping consists of.

They will make the bed (not change sheets) replace towels and take out trash. They’ll restock the coffee but ‘supplies’ are pretty limited since most properties are using wall-mounted toiletries anyway.

I asked Marriott if this is what they mean by housekeeping. They confirmed that the Westin Annapolis “is in compliance.”

Even making housekeeping optional sounds good in theory ‘guests are empowered’ but many guests won’t incur the cost of remembering to ask and then making the actual request for housekeeping. And they have to ask. Some will be bashful about it.

United Airlines figured out they could save money on food and beverage service in business class by eliminating the ‘wine flights’ where they offered to let customers try different wines and by eliminating dessert carts. Putting the choice in front of the passenger encouraged consumption. Making customers ask discouraged consumption. And in the process they turned an indulgent service into a workmanlike one.

Recently Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester toured the facility to talk about the global chip shortage.

Blunt Rochester got a behind the scenes look of how Hologic’s mammography technology is made.

She saw first hand how the global chip shortage is making it more difficult for the company to meet demand for its products.

“To come and see why it is so important and what these chips actually go into was really a great experience and important for me to take back to Washington” she said.

Blunt Rochester said the CHIPS and Technology Act signed into law this summer will work to help ease the country’s shortage of semiconductors in this country.

“This act will allow us to invest in our own country and bring those manufacturing jobs here that produce the chips that go into all of the different products that we have. It also has a very strong component for research and development and to make sure that we continue to be the innovator that we historically have been.”

The wisteria that enveloped the Duke-Lawrence House has been cut back and workers are gradually rehabbing the brick and clapboard building parts of which are more than 270 years old.

Windows installed in the 1980s have been replaced using hand-blown glass from Germany that has the same waves and air pockets the originals would have had in the 18th century. The red cedar shingles on the roof are being refinished with a mixture of pine tar and linseed oil used since colonial times.

The oldest section of the T-shaped house is a story and a half and was built in about 1747 when North Carolina was still a British colony. The newest section two stories clad in brick was added a decade or two later.

At a time when most homes were a single room this was a grand house says Reid Thomas a restoration specialist for the State Historic Preservation Office. It has six large rooms with five enormous brick fireplaces a central entryway with a winding staircase and a basement kitchen.

The house was built for John Duke most likely by enslaved laborers Reid says. Each brick would have been made by hand from locally dug clay and then held together using mortar made with lime from burned oyster shells. So many shells Reid says that the pile would have been higher than the two-story house.

“It was an enormous amount of work” he said looking up at the house. “It’s just great that it survives. We’ve lost so many. Glad it’s back in good hands.”

Those hands belong to Bob Tucci who bought the house outside the town of Rich Square last year. Tucci 75 set out to create a “museum-like” home for him and his wife Alice restored as close as possible to its original look and feel and filled with 18th century furniture or accurate reproductions.

“But it has to be comfortable” Tucci adds. “It’ll have a television.”

Tucci is an unlikely savior of a colonial plantation house. He works as a sales associate at a Home Depot store in a suburb of Baltimore where he and Alice live in a modest townhouse.

But Tucci has always loved colonial houses and wanted to build one of his own. He taught high school science and in his free time apprenticed with builders to learn the skills he would need to lay out a floor cut rafters and strap a roof.

He took the job at Home Depot 30 years ago he said because it let him pursue his dream.

“I wanted a job that allows me to do all these other things and I wanted to build a house” he said. “I wanted to build a colonial house a small house. I’d wanted to do that since I was in high school.”

So he did over many years in the rural New Hampshire town of Grafton. And he says the fate of that house made the Duke-Lawrence project possible.

Tim Hyder of Cardinal Joinery leans out from a window to caulk its exterior while working at the Duke-Lawrence House on Wednesday June 15 2022 in Rich Square N.C. The Duke-Lawrence House one of the oldest surviving houses in the state is being restored by Bob Tucci.

Duke-Lawrence had been gutted and neglected

Tucci is not the first to fall in love with the Duke-Lawrence House and work to bring it back to life. (The name reflects the fact that John Duke’s daughter married John Lawrence whose family owned the home until 1850.)

When Edward and Mildred Regan bought the house from the Murfreesboro Historic Association in 1979 it had been gutted and had no electricity water or indoor plumbing. The roof had been replaced with tin and the original interior woodwork including the stairs to the second floor had been stripped out in the 1930s and installed in a Richmond Virginia mansion that later became the Willow Oaks Country Club.

The Regans — retired steel company engineer and school teacher — had spent 10 years restoring an old home in New Jersey and wanted a new challenge. They recreated the wood paneling based on photos from an archive at N.C. State University and replaced the cedar shingles and missing dormers on the roof. With their support the state successfully nominated the home for a spot on the National Register of Historic Places.

Subsequent owners continued the work. A Catholic priest who moved into the home in the late 1990s is credited with restoring the missing stairs.

But by the time Tucci came across Duke-Lawrence during an online search it had not been lived in for many years and had started to deteriorate again. Tucci paid $230000 for the property which included nearly nine acres of land.

“A lot of people liked the acreage and the price” said Andy Tucker the broker who handled the listing. “But Bob’s the right person for the house.”

The Duke-Lawrence House is not widely known beyond certain circles of historians; it doesn’t appear on Wikipedia’s list of the state’s oldest buildings even though it would rank about 12th (the oldest is the Lane House in Edenton built in about 1719).

That’s because it has always been privately owned and far from the public eye says Myrick Howard president of Preservation North Carolina the nonprofit historic preservation group. But Howard said Duke-Lawrence is historically important which is why his group holds an easement on the home that prevents it from being demolished or significantly altered.

But the covenants don’t preclude changes that “make the house livable” as Tucci puts it including the modern kitchen a previous owner installed and the new wiring and air conditioning that were among his top priorities. A closet off the kitchen now houses a washer/dryer while two others have been converted into bathrooms each with showers.

“Alice says ‘Bob I need a shower'” he said. “Now we have two showers where there never was one.”

When the work is done the couple plans to visit the house often but not live in it full-time. Tucci says he expects to spend more than a half million dollars buying and improving the Duke-Lawrence House including a kitchen garden and small orchard with persimmon peach plum apple pear and fig trees.

Most of the money will come from an insurance settlement he received after the colonial Cape-style home he had built in New Hampshire was destroyed by fire in October 2020.

‘This is an amazing wall’

Tucci is able to do some of the work himself but also relies on specialists and contractors. Cardinal Joinery of Winston-Salem created the windows using the German glass and construction techniques from the period. Kurt Leahey who was overseeing prep work for Cardinal Joinery last summer said despite the neglect and its age Duke-Lawrence is still in good shape.

“The house is really well built” Leahey said. “It’s still incredibly plumb and square. This has been a real delight.”

Tucci also brought in Reid Thomas whose job with the state historic preservation office includes advising owners of historic properties on how to care for them. Thomas said he had visited the house before to meet with previous owners but it had been a long time.

Bob Tucci holds up one of the windows to be installed at the Duke-Lawrence House in Rich Square N.C. on Wednesday June 15 2022. Tucci is restoring the home one of the oldest houses in North Carolina.

As they toured the house Thomas pointed out historic details such as the trammel that once held pots over the fire in the basement kitchen and what appear to be original hand-planed shelves in the closet with the washer and dryer.

Thomas was especially impressed with the brick work on the exterior of the house. He pointed to the polished headers or small glazed bricks between the larger ones that created a checkerboard pattern.

“This is an amazing wall” he said.

Thomas said much of the exterior wood siding appeared to be original or close too it. Some of the paint was wrinkled from sun exposure but Thomas advised against replacing the wood.

“I think it would be worthwhile if you could keep it” he said. “It would probably outlast anything you replace it with.”

Tucci spent about 20 years building the house in New Hampshire working when he could and learning along the way. He knows he doesn’t have that kind of time now and is hoping to finish the Duke-Lawrence House in two years three tops.

“If it all stops tomorrow we had fun while we were at it” he said. As for the house? “We’ll just hand it off to somebody else.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2hlcmVzLXdoYXRzLW9wZW4tYW5kLWNsb3NlZC1vbi1sYWJvci1kYXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's What's Open and Closed on Labor Day,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/heres-whats-open-and-closed-on-labor-day on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2hlcmVzLXdoYXRzLW9wZW4tYW5kLWNsb3NlZC1vbi1sYWJvci1kYXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rb2FtbmV3c25vdy5jb20vbmV3cy9qb3BsaW4tbmV3cy1maXJzdC9wYW5lcmEtYnJlYWQtYnVpbGRpbmctbmV3LWxvY2F0aW9uLW9uLXJhbmdlbGluZS1pbi1qb3BsaW4vYXJ0aWNsZV9kNjc3ZjEzMi0xNDQ5LTVkMjMtOWFiNi0xNGY4MjdhNWEyYTMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Panera Bread building new location on Rangeline in Joplin,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

Here's What Experts Have to Say,"When something in your home looks dirty your natural instinct is probably to clean that item ASAP. But when it comes to air filters soap and water don't always do the trick. HEPA filters commonly found in portable air purifiers are one item that experts recommend replacing rather than trying to clean. Learn more about these powerful filters and how you can best replace them when the time comes.

What Is a HEPA Filter?

HEPA which stands for high-efficiency particulate air is a type of air filter that basically looks like folded paper. If you have a quality portable air purifier in your home it likely has a HEPA filter which is a filter consisting of an interwoven matrix of fibers for air to pass through—the best air purifiers for pets all have HEPA filters. Because the fibers are densely packed they create a very small pathway for air to travel through.

This net of fibers captures small particulates and filters them out of the air you breathe says George Negron vice president of operations at air quality company EnviroKlenz which ultimately helps improve indoor air quality. HEPA filters may also be found in your home's air handling system and some vacuum cleaners have them as well. You can even find them in a few top shop vacs.

What Do HEPA Filters Do?

Filters are defined by how efficient they are at removing particulates from an air stream. HEPA filters are very good at capturing particles of all sizes and theoretically remove at least 99.97 percent of particles with a size of 0.3 microns. This is especially important in vacuum cleaners for pets like the Shark Wandvac which trap and prevent allergens from releasing back into the air. These are among the most difficult particle sizes to catch says John Bloemer an engineering fellow at Aprilaire who's been in the air quality industry for more than two decades.

HEPA filters collect harmful microscopic particles.

These 0.3-micron particles come from things like combustion smoke smog and diesel exhaust and because of their size they can go deep into your lungs as you breathe Bloemer says. By contrast particles such as the pollen that aggravates your allergies each spring are typically 10 microns so they're captured by your body's own filtration system (i.e. your nose and throat) rather than going into your lungs. That's why HEPA filtration is so critical to capturing those 0.3-micron particles.

Can You Clean a HEPA Filter?

If you see a visible buildup of dust or particles on a HEPA filter (it may look gray or dirty) or observe reduced airflow through your portable air purifier you may assume that's an indication the HEPA filter needs cleaning. However experts say HEPA filters should always be replaced rather than cleaned.

Cleaning destroys the filter.

""You cannot clean a HEPA filter by using something like a vacuum because the particles are trapped not only on the surface of the filter but also deep inside the media"" Bloemer says. Don't even think about running it under your sink either—liquids like water and soap will destroy the filter media he adds.

Some caked-on dirt is OK.

When you're seeing buildup on a HEPA filter that's all the captured particles which can range from particles generated from combustion (think car exhaust gas stoves and candles) to mold spores and animal dander says Ted Myatt ScD senior scientist at Environmental Health & Engineering. These particles can be generated indoors or outdoors and migrated through open windows wall joints or cracks. It may sound counterintuitive but on one level a HEPA filter may work better when it has a thin caked-on layer of collected particles—but at some point air will have a hard time getting through the filter Myatt says which means the filter needs to be replaced.

Pre-filters can be cleaned.

The one exception to replacing a HEPA filter when it's dirty is if you have an air system that has a pre-filter in front of the HEPA filter Negron says. This pre-filter will capture some of the larger dust and particles and some of these prefilters are washable to enable you to remove the dust and debris they collect—note that this is not the actual HEPA filter though. Again experts agree that HEPA filters should always be replaced when dirty and not cleaned.

How Do You Replace a HEPA Filter?

If you observe that your HEPA filter has a visible buildup the best plan of action is to purchase a new filter. To do this turn off your unit find the access door remove the old filter and put the new one in Bloemer says.

You don't have to leave it up to your own eyes though. Most manufacturers will also provide a recommended changing interval (which generally is around six to 12 months) and some portable air purifiers will have an indicator light that lets you know when to replace the HEPA filter.

However time is not always the best indicator says Negron since the true reason to replace a HEPA filter is based on how much particulate matter is collected which can vary widely in different environments. If your air purifier is constantly running or your space is particularly smoky or pollen-filled plan to replace your HEPA filter more often.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbmd1YXJkbmdyLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5L3RlYW1tYXN0ZXJzLWNyZWF0aW5nLWNoYW1waW9ucy10aHJvdWdoLWhlYWx0aHktY29tcGV0aXRpdmUtc2tpbGxzL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbmd1YXJkbmdyLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5L3RlYW1tYXN0ZXJzLWNyZWF0aW5nLWNoYW1waW9ucy10aHJvdWdoLWhlYWx0aHktY29tcGV0aXRpdmUtc2tpbGxzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TeamMasters: Creating champions through healthy competitive skills,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/09/teammasters-creating-champions-through-healthy-competitive-skills/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbmd1YXJkbmdyLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5L3RlYW1tYXN0ZXJzLWNyZWF0aW5nLWNoYW1waW9ucy10aHJvdWdoLWhlYWx0aHktY29tcGV0aXRpdmUtc2tpbGxzL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbmd1YXJkbmdyLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5L3RlYW1tYXN0ZXJzLWNyZWF0aW5nLWNoYW1waW9ucy10aHJvdWdoLWhlYWx0aHktY29tcGV0aXRpdmUtc2tpbGxzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,
HRL,Hormel Foods,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vc3R1ZHlmaW5kcy5vcmcvdGFpbGdhdGluZy1ldGlxdWV0dGUtZm9vZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,College football 101: Here are the unwritten rules of tailgating according to a new survey -,"NEW YORK — “Grill master” is the most coveted job to have at a tailgating event according to new research. A poll of 5000 Americans — including 100 people in each of the 50 states — reveals that 29 percent believe manning the grill to be the best job to have at a tailgate party while 25 percent opt for “side dish taster” or “game hype man” (23%).

Other popular tailgate duties include cup re-filler (18%) and food server (18%). In fact 34 percent of respondents agree that it’s better to have one designated person man the grill rather than rotating between party guests (30%).

It’s no surprise that portable grills are the most popular cooking method for tailgating (67%). In fact those in East Coast locations like Pennsylvania (76%) and Virginia (74%) are most likely to choose a portable grill.

Almost half the poll (49%) prefer traditional outdoor grills especially those in Southeastern states like Alabama (62%) and Mississippi (62%). The third most popular cooking method is a crock pot (38%) which is exceedingly popular in South Dakota (56%) but very unpopular in Hawaii (19%).

Who gets to the game first?

Conducted by OnePoll on behalf of Hormel Foods the survey also explored how tailgaters use food and friends to create the most fun event possible. The average respondent attends two tailgates per year with the optimal group size being 11 people on average.

Tailgaters typically arrive about two hours before a sporting event. Respondents name either their friends (56%) or themselves (42%) as the most likely people to arrive first. About one-quarter (24%) say their siblings are likely to arrive first but grandma will likely be the last to arrive with only three percent believing she would be first.

Bring a dish – or don’t come back!

The vast majority of respondents (84%) believe that everyone attending a tailgate should bring at least one item.

This unspoken rule is highly respected as almost half (46%) of respondents agree that if someone brings nothing they are less likely to get an invite to the next tailgate. Almost two-thirds (63%) of respondents are also likely to bring their favorite dish regardless of whether everyone else enjoys it or not! Overall the perfect tailgate has five different dishes.

Almost three in 10 (29%) prefer to make something from scratch whereas 22 percent just pick something up from the store.

“Tailgates may look different around the country however gathering with friends and family to enjoy food during a game is universal” says Deanna Brady executive vice president of Retail for Hormel Foods in a statement. “We believe food is love so whether you grab your favorite ready-made snacks prepare a favorite must-have meal several hours ahead of time or work the grill right there in the parking lot eating and sharing food provides a fun and natural way to celebrate together.”

Leave the ice cream at home!

According to American tailgaters the best foods to bring to a tailgate are burgers (66%) hot dogs (56%) and chips (52%).

However a few states vary from those top choices and are more likely to opt for a hot dog over a burger like those in the Midwest and West such as Arizona (66% vs 58%) and Washington (60% vs 55%).

In comparison the worst foods are ice cream and popsicles (41%) pie (24%) and salad (23%).

While only 12 percent of all respondents believe pasta salad is a tailgate staple 34 percent of those who live in Maine believe it is one of the best.

These choices could be due to the fact that according to respondents the perfect tailgate food is portable (58%) easy to cook (56%) and has a long shelf-life outside of the fridge (48%). Respondents also agree on the worst things to forget to bring to a tailgate — including plates (70%) napkins (54%) and cups (46%).

In the end almost three-quarters (72%) of Americans agree that the food selection can make or break a tailgate.

“Just like sports fans are passionate about rituals around their favorite teams and game day people have their go-to tailgating foods” Brady says. “Burgers and hot dogs are popular staples but wherever you are and whatever you cook it’s perfect tailgating food if you love it.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

That might sound bizarre especially in the face of Windows 11 and macOS Monterey but Chrome OS Flex as it's called is a free version of the Chrome OS you know and love from Chromebooks designed to run on old Windows and macOS machines. It's aimed at enterprise and educational use but there's nothing stopping you from giving it a go.

The page emphasizes the usual benefits of Chrome OS that it's fast and light and updates quietly in the background when not in use. However it also focuses on how this is an environmentally friendly OS; in that it gives a new life to computers that otherwise wouldn't get updates from their original manufacturer. There's also attention paid to how an IT admin can easily manage multiple Chrome OS Flex devices and keep them safe and updated remotely or through USB drives.

Use a Mac VPN or Windows VPN to stay safe online

While aimed at teachers students and office staff for now the possibility of resurrecting older devices to use a fully up-to-date operating system is tantalizing.

If you're happy with how a device works aside from its software being outdated it may well be worth swapping to Chrome OS rather than spending more on a new one. Sure ChromeOS behaves differently to Windows or macOS particularly in that it requires an internet connection to do pretty much anything since all your data is stored in the cloud. But it's easy to learn and use if you're already a Chrome browser user.

You can learn how to turn an old laptop or PC into a Chromebook using ChromeOS Flex as well.

If you want to try ChromeOS Flex yourself then you can go to Google's page download the OS to a USB drive and then plug it into any Mac or PC to boot it up. However to do so you need to register with Google for the early access program and with it being early access there's likely going to be bugs. Also from the looks of things it's basically the same as regular Chrome OS so there is nothing new to try unless you're specifically looking its potential to revamp an ageing computer.

For those that don’t know AMS Performance is a well-respected tuner headquartered in West Chicago best known for building and tuning the world’s quickest GT-Rs. Evidently they know a thing or two about fast Nissans and have wasted no time in working their magic on the 2023 Z.

Driving the Z is the same 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 ‘VR30’ engine powering a number of Infiniti models. AMS Performance was already intimately familiar with the VR30 before the 2023 Z was launched and had developed Infiniti tunes for it alongside EcuTek. This gave it a jumpstart in giving the Z more horsepower and torque.

Watch Also: Jay Leno Is Quite Impressed With The New Nissan Z

Nissan’s official claim is that the new Z is good for 400 hp at 6400 rpm and 350 lb-ft (474 Nm) of torque from 1600 to 5600 rpm but these are obviously figures at the crank not at the wheels. When strapped onto its dyno a Z tuned by AMS Performance delivered 452 hp and 523 lb-ft (709 Nm) of torque through its wheels. Those are some serious gains with a simple tune.

To put those figures into perspective it’s worth watching the video below from YouTuber savagegeese. During it he strapped a standard 2023 Z onto AMS Performance’s dyno where it delivered 372 hp and 362 lb-ft (491 Nm) of torque through the rear wheels. So not only has the tune added 80 hp at the wheels but it has also added a huge 161 lb-ft (218 Nm) of torque.

The car that was dyno tested was also equipped with an aftermarket exhaust and high octane race fuel. The tuner notes that these figures are a work in progress and will likely change as work on the platform continues."

Humana-Paredes and Wilkerson were defeated 2-1 (21-18 17-21 15-10) by Americans Taryn Klot and Kristen Nuss in the final. It was the second loss the Canadian duo suffered to Klot and Nuss at the event following a 2-0 result (21-18 21-15) on Friday.

Last week Humana-Paredes and Sarah Pavan Canada's most decorated women's beach volleyball team ended their partnership after five years together.

The former world champions said it's common in their sport to part ways after a few years.

""We have a lot of respect for each other and are very proud of what we have accomplished as a team over the last five years"" the two-time Commonwealth Games champions said in a mutual statement. ""As with many long-term beach volleyball partnerships we have both decided it is time to explore new options in our athletic careers separately.""

Pavan also competed at the Chicago Open with Latvia's Tina Graudina. The duo were eliminated by eventual winners Klot and Nuss with a 2-1 defeat after winning the first set (12-21 21-18 17-15).

Wilkerson and Humana-Paredes both from Toronto were last paired together at their hometown's York University. Wilkerson split with fellow Canadian beach volleyball partner Heather Bansley earlier this year and has since been competing alongside Sophie Bukovec from Toronto.

Pavan of Kitchener Ont. and Humana-Paredes won the world title in 2019. They captured their second Commonwealth Games gold medal last month in Birmingham England.

They've also reached the Beach Volleyball World Tour podium numerous times including winning gold this year at the Jurmala Beach Pro Tour Elite 16 tournament in Latvia.

At the Tokyo Olympics the two went undefeated in pool play without dropping a set. They were ousted in the quarter-finals with a 2-1 loss to Australians Mariafe Artacho del Solar and Taliqua Clancy.

Kill spent five seasons at Minnesota but had to step down in 2015 due to issues related to epilepsy. Kill has made several stops since then including becoming an interim head coach at TCU after Gary Patterson's dismissal last season but he surprised many when he took the head coaching job with the Aggies last fall.

""It destroyed us"" Kill said of his departure in 2015. ""I didn’t want to leave the way I went out. That's why I’m coaching now. I want to go out the way I want to not something taken away from me. People can judge me I know what I stand for.”

Kill's return to Minnesota dominated the headlines coming into the game as he previously stated he would never set foot in what is now known as Huntington Bank Stadium. Kill threw more gas on the fire when he said he wasn't sure if he'd shake current head coach P.J. Fleck's hand.

Fleck did his best to extinguish the beef by confronting Kill for a handshake before and after the game. He also spoke kindly of Kill who he served under as a wide receivers coach at Northern Illinois in 2008.

""I respect Jerry Kill wholeheartedly"" Fleck said. ""I’ve never said one thing ever negative about Jerry Kill. What I told him at the beginning was thank you for all that you’ve done for my career. Always had the utmost respect for him.""

Kill was also asked what he said to Fleck during the handshake to which he said ""It was just business.""

With the Aggies out of the way the Gophers will continue their season next week against Illinois State.",,,,,,,,,,,,

IBM may have had the 360 and the 370 but Amdahl built the 470 - clearly a case of turn the volume up to 11. We tend to think that the phenomenon of engineers and scientists being at the top of a company is something that started with Bill Gates Steve Wozniak or Gary Kildal. But this just isn’t the case. Even back in the days when IBM was the single most important computer company it was possible for one of its engineers to escape and make an impact that disturbed even Big Blue. Gene Amdahl

November 16 1922 - November 10 2015 Gene Amdahl was a physicist who got into computers because he wanted to work out something complicated. In 1950 he was asked by one of his professors to calculate whether the nuclear strong force was really enough to hold together a nucleus. For thirty days Amdahl slaved over a sliderule and a mechanical desk calculator to provide only two more significant digits to the solution. This is the sort of experience that drove many a scientist to become a computer pioneer! Amdahl had taught physics and then electronics to the navy during the war and was well able to understand what was going on in the new field of electronic digital computers. Amdahl's Design For the WISC In 1951 he started to build the Wisconsin Integrally Synchronized Computer (WISC). It had a floating point unit and could execute four instructions in parallel. This was very advanced for the time and indicated Amdahl’s flair for digital electronics and systems. The machine itself wasn’t finished for many years because it was used as a training project in electronics but it served its purpose and Amdahl got a PhD out of it - but in theoretical physics! Wisconsin Integrally Synchronized Computer In 1952 he joined IBM and ended up in the New York plant where the IBM 701 defence calculator was just being finished. It was already clear that something more powerful was needed and so he was set to work as chief planner and project engineer on its replacement the 704. The IBM 704 of 1954 The IBM 704 was a remarkable machine. It had three addressable index registers and a floating point hardware unit which made programming it very much easier. The 704 was an ideal scientific computer. It worked in binary and it was for the time fast. IBM sold a lot of 704s partly because of its overall design and partly because it was the machine that Fortran was developed for. Without the three index registerscreating a compiler would have been much more difficult. After the 704 Amdahl designed the 709. But after that it looked as if IBM wasn’t going to let him get another machine to himself. Machines were getting bigger all the time and designing them was becoming increasingly a team effort. The IBM 709 of 1957 When he was denied a leading roll in IBM’s biggest project of the time - the STRETCH computer later to become the 7030 - he left. In 1955 he found himself working for a small company called Ramo-Wooldridge preparing proposals and planning the RW440 process control computer. <ASIN:0945903197> <ASIN:0123744938> <ASIN:0887309895> <ASIN:0387982698>

Consequently the country is emerging as a talent hub for quantum computing said Sandip Patel MD IBM India/South Asia region in an interview. Edited excerpts

What are the cardinal differences between quantum and classical computing?

Quantum computing is an exciting new technology that will shape our world of tomorrow by providing us with an edge and a myriad of possibilities. Quantum computing is a fundamentally different way of processing information compared to today’s classical computing systems. While today’s classical computers store information as binary 0 and 1 states quantum computers draw on the fundamental laws of nature to carry out calculations using quantum bits. Unlike a bit that has to be a 0 or a 1 a qubit can be in a combination of states which allows for exponentially larger calculations and gives them the potential to solve complex problems which even the most powerful classical supercomputers are not capable of.

How will quantum computing provide an edge over classical computing in terms of solving mankind’s everyday challenges around life and work?

Quantum computers tap into the quantum mechanical phenomenon to manipulate information and are expected to shed light on processes of molecular and chemical interactions address difficult optimisation problems and boost the power of artificial intelligence. Advances like these could open the door to new scientific discoveries life-saving drugs and improvements in supply chains logistics and the modelling of financial data. IBM today is actively working with major corporations and governments to help advance their quantum roadmaps and help grows their pool of quantum talent to make quantum computing practical for the benefit of science industry and society.

What will be IBM India’s contribution to Big Blue’s global initiatives around quantum computing?

In India we are witnessing a growing interest in quantum computing with active participation (amongst the highest) from students developers and academia in various initiatives like the IBM Quantum Challenge IBM Quantum Summer School Qiskit Challenge-India (Qiskit is an open-source software development kit built by IBM for the quantum developer community) and so on. We also have a growing community of Qiskit Advocates and IBM Quantum Ambassadors in India. Furthermore we regularly organise India-focused programmes such as Qiskit India Week of Quantum which celebrated women in quantum to kickstart their journeys in quantum and was attended by almost 300 students. The Qiskit textbook is available in Tamil Bengali and Hindi and was accessed more than 30000 times by students in India in 2021 alone. We see India as a talent hub for quantum computing skills that is crucial for growing and maintaining such an interdisciplinary field.

Will you give us some details about IBM’s collaboration with premier institutions in India to accelerate advanced training and research around quantum computing?

Academia plays an important role in building skills for any deep technology including quantum. Hence last May we announced our collaboration with leading educational institutions in India through the IBM Quantum Educators Programme. The faculty and students of these institutions will be able to access IBM Quantum systems quantum learning resources and quantum tools over IBM Cloud for educational purposes. This allows them to work on actual quantum computers and program them using the Qiskit open-source framework. In partnership with the Indian Institute of Technology – Madras IBM conducted a course on Quantum Computing on the NPTEL platform last year which had more than 10000 participants. We are also collaborating with academia for joint research on quantum computing and recently one of the research papers got accepted at a top Physics Conference.

At what stage is India in quantum computing how long will it take to see commercialisation and where will it find mass applications?

India is poised to play a pivotal role in the quantum technology revolution globally. IBM is committed to helping India advance its quantum agenda by developing the talent and skills landscape and building an ecosystem with industry business academia and government. We are counting on the vibrant Indian talent and expertise to help solve some of the most pressing challenges. As per our quantum roadmap announced in 2021 IBM debuted its first 127-qubit processor. In 2022 IBM extended its quantum roadmap even further to clearly lay out how we will blaze a path towards frictionless quantum computing. This expanded roadmap includes our plans to build a 4000+qubit processor by 2023 along with significant milestones to build an intelligent quantum software orchestration platform that will abstract away the noise and complexity of quantum machines and allow large and complicated problems to be easily broken apart and solved across a network of quantum and classical systems. Once realised this era of quantum-centric supercomputing will open up new large and powerful computational spaces for industries globally.

What is IBM’s people strategy around quantum computing for Indian India?

In India we have a strong team working across research development and consulting working closely with academia industry and the public sector. Our team is working to support and accelerate India’s national quantum mission and is participating in building a strong quantum ecosystem as that is crucial for succeeding. The team has been constantly growing to support the needs of the Indian ecosystem and is only expected to grow even further in the coming years as it supports more and more customers to take their quantum journey. We have quantum scientists and engineers around the world conducting fundamental research to improve the technology as well as collaborating with our partners to advance toward practical applications with a quantum advantage for science and business. Quantum requires multidisciplinary skills and IBM has the best scientists and engineers working together to improve the technology and drive applications of importance to the industry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vZW4uY2hlc3NiYXNlLmNvbS9wb3N0LzI1LXllYXJzLWxhdGVyLWRlZXAtYmx1ZS12cy1rYXNwYXJvdtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,25 years later: Deep Blue vs Kasparov,"BBC Four the British free-to-air television channel hosted the discussion as part of their Reunion series . The battle of man vs machine took place in New York 25 years ago. IBM had proposed a six-game match which was held in a hushed room while a packed audience watched it broadcast on large screens a few floors below. Every move was streamed online threatening to crash a fledgling Internet.

Over the tense nine days the mood turned from anticipation to suspicion to bewilderment. Not only would the world of chess never be the same again but the balance of power between humans and computers seemed to have shifted irrevocably. Was it the dawning of a new age?

In the BBC Four broadcast Kirsty Wark reunites the chess masters and AI pioneers who went into battle to test the limits of human and artificial intelligence:

Frederic Friedel advisor to Garry Kasparov;

Malcolm Pein Kasparov team member and IBM consultant;

Murray Campbell co-creator of Deep Blue;

Joel Benjamin IBM’s official grandmaster consultant;

Maurice Ashley Grandmaster author and commentator who covered the big match;

Steven Levy Editor at Large at Wired Magazine who scooped the front cover for Newsweek.

The producer of the A Whistledown production for BBC Radio 4 was Ruth Abrahams the series Producer David Prest. You can follow the entire 42-minute discussion here:

Here are some excerpts from the discussion:

Kirsty Wark: The match was held on the 35th floor of a skyscraper in New York. It was one of those landmark challenges in the spirit of the famous Touring Test of 1950 – humanity's last chance to prove itself before computers outstripped us forever. Deep Blue was housed in twin black cabinets weighing 1.4 tonnes and evaluating 200 million chest positions per second.

Murray Campbell [computer scientist at IBM and co-creator of Deep Blue] when did you first become interested in chess?

Murray Campbell: I was a chess player from quite a young age and was looking for what to study in college. I discovered a computer that could play chess. That inspired me to go into computer science. Deep Thought was created by a group of graduate students at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. It was sort of a fun project something that we did for a lark.

KW: Frederick Friedel [co-founder of ChessBase] how did you meet Garry Kasparov?

Frederic Friedel: It was in 1985 when he came to Hamburg. I had written him a fan letter and he said he wanted to meet me. We sat together every evening for a whole week. I told him what a computer can do and he would tell me what a computer should do for chess. We designed a plan one that changed chess completely.

Malcolm Pein: In 1993 I was commercializing the sale of this chess database that Frederic referred to. All of a sudden we became so much more powerful we could learn at a much faster rate. In a sense computers enabled us to completely democratize chess...

KW: Frederick Friedel how did you and Kasparov prepare for the match?

FF: I didn't dare to tell him you must play an Open Spanish and things like that. I just said think about it please isn't it better not to play anti-computer chess because you're not very good at it.

Maurice Ashley: [commentator at the Deep Blue-Kasparov match] We were all consistent with the same idea: Garry is too good for this computer. We were all confident that he was simply going to dominate this machine. It did not rise to the level of the greatest entity playing chess on the planet.

Joel Benjamin: [grandmaster part of the Deep Blue team] I was obviously not happy about losing the first game but I felt that Kasparov was going to get overconfident especially because in general he's a very confident person he thinks he can solve any kind of problem.

BBC4: On the fourth of May following his win the previous day Kasparov was feeling in control. Then came the shock: Kasparov lost game two he resigned in the middle of what he considered a hopeless situation instead of fighting for a draw. It represented a steep change in the way that computers played chess. This was not a computer type game this was real chess. Deep Blue's sudden strategic play was gnawing away at Kasparov's mind.

FF: The mood after that second game was just pure devastation. We didn't know what had happened and just moaned and groaned the entire evening. Then the next morning I had a conversation with Malcolm and with ChessBase and they revealed to me that in the final position Garry could have drawn. I showed it Yury Dokhoian Garry's second and now came the question: who's going to tell Garry? Yuri said ""okay I'll tell him."" We were walking down the street and he went to Garry and started to explain in Russian. Garry was petrified.

JB: The move that really frightened Kasparov was a bug [in the first game]. That was the thing it wasn't supposed to do. So it's very bizarre that the computer freaking out actually helped us.

FF: Garry became very nervous about game two. He wanted printouts so that you can check whether they cheated or not. IBM said no. He was psyching himself out. Suddenly there was a lot of animosity. Garry expected a rematch – he'd won the first one in 1996 and lost the second one in 1997. He expected a new match but they refused. The mood changed dramatically.

MA: The audience's mood after game six: stunned shocked. I think those of us who had this the sense of the invincibility of Kasparov suddenly it seemed like something had happened not just to him but really to humanity itself. The terminator had arrived.

MC: I'd been building to the moment for decades and it was somewhat tempered by the fact that I had been accused of cheating and it took 20 years for him to apologize and admit that there had been no cheating.

KW: Frederic Friedel what was your sense of the role of computers in chess after Deep Blue?

FF: Garry didn't believe that he'd been beaten by a stronger entity than himself but he knew that's going to come. Immediately after this we started discussing what can we do about it. One of his ideas was ""Advanced Chess"" which is a human and a computer playing against a human and a computer. This would make the system stronger than the human or the computer alone.

MC: I remember shortly afterwards the match a former US champion came to me he said ""I'm giving up chess it's finished now with Deep Blue having defeated Garry. I said ""well a Ferrari is faster than Linford Christie that doesn't mean that athletics is gone. All computers are really doing are enhancing our understanding of the game.

Steven Levy: [American journalist NYT Newsweek etc] This is all the history of AI. Every time a computer does something that people say you're not going to get from an AI computer they go on to the next thing. To me the story wasn't about chess it was a story about AI and our relationship to our overlord to be.

FF: I spent two and a half weeks in the Plaza Hotel with Garry. We had breakfast lunch and dinner together. I went through all the high moments and especially the devastating moments. If you ask me would you like to do it again I would say probably no. It was very taxing...",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYWRkbGV5b3Vyb3dua2Fub28uY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDQvaGF3YWlpYW4tYWlybGluZXMtaXMtYmVpbmctc3VlZC1mb3ItY29udHJhY3QtYnJlYWNoLWJlY2F1c2UtaXQtYWRkZWQtYS03LXN1cmNoYXJnZS10by1jZXJ0YWluLWJvb2tpbmdzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hawaiian Airlines is Being Sued for Contract Breach Because it Added a $7 Surcharge to Certain Bookings,"Hawaiian Airlines is being sued by the maker of one of the largest travel reservation systems in the world because the carrier has allegedly breached a “heavily negotiated” contract in a “calculated strategy” to renegotiate the agreement.

Sabre Global Technologies filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York last week alleging that Hawaiian’s actions have had “ripple effects throughout the travel distribution ecosystem” and cost the company “substantially more” than $75000 in lost profits.

Originally developed by American Airlines and IBM in the 1960s Sabre was spun off into an independent global distribution system or GDS in the 70s. Sabre’s GDS acts as an intermediary between airlines hotels and car rental companies and more than 425000 travel agents around the world.

The GDS allow travel agents and consumers to search compare and book travel but travel companies have to pay to be part of the GDS and Sabre can take a cut of any booking made through its system.

In May Hawaiian suddenly stopped listing its inter-island flights on Sabre and added a $7 surcharge on any flight booked through Sabre.

But Hawaiian offered travel agents an alternative. Rather than using Sabre travel agents are being encouraged to access its proprietary HAChannel+ program that uses a new standard developed by the airline industry called New Distribution Capability (NDC).

NDC has been developed by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to “transform the way air products are retailed to corporations leisure and business travelers”. In July for example Hawaiian struck a deal with Priceline to sell airfares via HAChannel+ rather than through a traditional GDS.

The heavily redacted lawsuit however alleges that by removing certain routes from the GDS and adding a surcharge Hawaiian has breached its contract with Sabre and that has put its business at a competitive disadvantage.

Sabre is one of three major GDS suppliers who have come to control the way airfares are sold but new technology is challenging their business. In particular airlines want to embrace tech that allows them to market important features like WiFi availability as well as distinguishing restrictive fares like Basic Economy.

Traditional GDS systems have struggled to handle all this additional information because they were built in a time when the only information that was required was the fare and travel class.

Airlines have rebuilt their websites to display and sell ancillary products but many consumers who rely on third-party websites to book travel don’t always get the full picture of what’s available or what restrictions have been placed on their tickets. NDC hopes to change that."

Samples testing positive for intestinal parasitism were identified in every city in every country and from > 90% of parks in those cities suggesting that any dog exercised outside of the home can be at risk of infection. The methodology used in the present study was similar to that of a 2019 study conducted across the USA (the DOGPARCS study) in which fresh fecal samples were collected from over 3000 dogs [16]. Similar to the results in the USA study in the present study Giardia was the most prevalent intestinal parasite detected and the overall prevalence of the primary nematodes was comparable (in that study 8.8% of dogs and 49.7% of parks compared with 7.6% of dogs and 57.3% of parks in this study). However ascarid prevalence was much lower in the DOGPARCS study than in the present study (0.6% vs 3.6%) and hookworm prevalence much higher (7.1% [predominantly A. caninum] vs 3.2% [predominantly U. stenocephala]).

A number of limitations to the present study must be acknowledged. First collections were completed from each park within a short period of just 1 or 2 days so that a limited number of dogs and parks were sampled resulting in a potential underestimate of the presence of intestinal parasites. Second the number of cities sampled in each country was too low to allow extrapolation of findings to the country as a whole especially for Ireland Austria and Switzerland where collections were completed from just a single city. Third samples were collected country by country spanning spring through late summer; consequently the seasonal variations in prevalence are not captured by the data potentially influencing between-country comparisons. Importantly by collecting samples through the spring–summer period seasonal fluctuations of infections with ascarids (highest seasonal prevalence suggested as December and January) and whipworms (highest prevalence in January and February) would have been missed potentially leading to an underestimation of the prevalence of these nematodes specifically [17]. Fourth the study was designed to provide insight into the prevalence of the primary nematodes and Giardia. The results do not provide any indication of the prevalence of cestodes and lungworms because the methodologies used were not sensitive for their detection (although A. vasorum and C. vulpis were detected in a number of samples). Fifth samples positive for Toxocara spp. by flotation were not further analyzed to differentiate between T. canis and T. cati leaving potential T. cati eggs resulting from coprophagia unnoted [18]. However T. cati and T. canis are host specific meaning a positive Toxocara spp. antigen result in this study is highly unlikely to be an active T. cati infection [18]. Finally while the results demonstrate that pet dogs can be a source of environmental parasite contamination those from which samples were collected were accompanied by their owners approximately three quarters of whom report providing some anthelmintic treatment. As free-roaming and shelter dogs are more likely to have intestinal parasite burdens than those included in our study our results may underestimate the prevalence of canine intestinal parasite infection rate and the resulting health risk arising from the wider dog population [2 6 9]. Allowing for these limitations the results do provide a sound basis for guidance on the presence of intestinal parasitism of pet dogs in Europe with Giardia and nematodes.

The high Giardia prevalence found in this study aligns with that reported in other studies completed throughout Europe and beyond (reviewed by Bouzid et al. [19]) that often identify it as the most common canine intestinal parasite infection [16 19 20]. In those studies the authors reported a higher proportion of younger than older dogs were positive for Giardia. In our study combining the coproantigen immunoassay and centrifugal flotation technique detected more than sevenfold the number of positive tests for Giardia than flotation alone (16.9% coproantigen/2.3% centrifugal flotation/17.3% combined) consistent with other reports showing that flotation is unreliable for the detection of canine infection with this parasite [4 19 21]. That unreliability may be attributed to both the intermittent excretion and fragility of cysts which can degenerate between fecal sample collection and examination at the laboratory and to potential disruption caused by the osmotic pressure of a concentrated zinc sulfate solution [16].

The combined use of the coproantigen assay and flotation would be a contributing factor to the relatively high proportion of dogs that tested positive for Giardia in the present study compared to the reported overall prevalence of up to 7% in European dogs and cats [22]. Additionally over half of the dogs who tested positive for Giardia infection in this study were aged < 3 years. Nonetheless the 12.0% of positive Giardia findings from flotation tests in our study is substantially higher than the ESCCAP (European Scientific Counsel for Companion Animal Parasites) estimate (3–7% in dogs and cats significantly higher in young animals) although it is broadly consistent with other reports of a prevalence ranging from 9% to 16% in dogs in Belgium and Germany respectively and much lower than the 30–41.0% found in other studies in Europe [4 8 2324252627]. While the data do not provide a sound basis to conclude that a park visit increases the risk of canine infection with Giardia it may be possible that the gathering of dogs in parks provides greater potential for exposure particularly if the environment encourages congregation around water sources.

Dogs reportedly receiving an anthelmintic within 1 month prior to sample collection were significantly less often positive for nematodes than those treated > 1 month previously after accounting for age differences in these groups. Unexpectedly dogs not receiving anthelmintics had a slightly lower percentage of positive results for nematodes than dogs reported to be receiving anthelmintics although this difference was not significant. While we accounted for differences in age other lifestyle factors (e.g. home environment frequency of exposure to infection sources) could have impacted the positive findings in these groups. One explanation may be that as time from administration increased owners confused other medications (e.g. flea/tick treatment) with anthelmintic. Additionally having been advised during the interview that the study objective was to detect intestinal parasites in their dog some owners may have felt social pressure to respond positively to the question on the use of anthelmintic. Thus across countries a surprisingly high country-level median percentage of respondents (83%) indicated that their dog had been treated. However the results suggest that > 60% of owners had not treated their dog within the previous 3 months consistent with earlier surveys showing that there are widespread failures in adhering to recommendations of ESCCAP regarding the frequency of anthelmintic treatment [2829303132]. Those recommendations state that dogs with outdoor access and contact with other dogs or parks should be tested or treated at least 4 times per year to provide effective control of ascarids and other intestinal helminth parasites.

Owner failure to adhere to expert recommendations is a likely contributing factor to the relatively high prevalence of ascarids that were found in all age groups including older dogs. Ascarids continue to be of concern not least because of their zoonotic potential. Adult female T. canis are capable of producing up to 85000 eggs per day; these eggs are resistant to common disinfectants are largely refractory to extreme environmental conditions and can survive for years to infect other dogs and non-canine hosts including humans [33]. That prolificity together with the environmental hardiness of eggs lack of susceptibility of inhibited stages to most anthelmintic drug treatments transplacental transmission so that puppies are born with infections and dog-owner failure to follow testing and treatment guidelines are all factors underlying the continuing high prevalence of this zoonotic parasite. Following infection the migratory larvae have been diagnosed as the cause of a range of human neurological ophthalmologic pulmonary and cutaneous symptoms [34]. The prevalence of positive tests in dogs aged between 4 and 6 years and ≥ 7 years serves as a reminder of the need for continued testing and treatment of dogs of all ages including older dogs that may act as important reservoirs of infection even if the infection is not clinically apparent (Fig. 4). Other reports including a recent review have shown that the prevalence of Toxocara spp. infections has remained worryingly high over many decades and with few exceptions our study results are consistent with these earlier findings [3435363738].

In the present study we did not establish any clear trends between the proportions of nematode-positive tests and owners’ recollection of timing of the latest anthelmintic use. However it is worthy of mention that of the countries with results from at least 100 dogs and 10 sites Portugal and the UK had the highest proportion of owners responding that they had treated their dog within the previous 3 months (68.0% and 64.5% respectively) and the lowest percentage of ascarid eggs was detected in samples from these two countries (0.7% and 0.0%). In contrast some countries with lower owner-reported anthelmintic administration within the previous 3 months specifically Italy (14.9%) and the Netherlands (40.7%) had the highest prevalence of ascarid-positive tests (7.2% and 10.8% respectively). Italy also had the highest proportion of positive tests for whipworm and was a close second to Germany for positive tests for hookworm (43.4% of dogs reportedly treated with anthelmintic within the previous 3 months).

Hookworms which were most prevalent in Germany but detected in all countries appeared to be mainly U. stenocephala. Only two samples both from France were positive for A. caninum which has zoonotic potential and a life-cycle favored by tropical and subtropical climates as does its potentially zoonotic (but less pathogenic) relative Ancylostoma braziliense. The short life-cycle of A. caninum (prepatent period: 2–3 weeks) prolific egg-laying (25000 eggs/adult per day) and travel/importation of infected pets provide the potential for a rapid increase in risk of infection. This was shown in the USA where between 2015 and 2018 there was a 47% increase in reported prevalence of hookworms [17]. Many European reports describe a high prevalence of Ancylostomatidae relative to other canine intestinal parasites without providing details on species [12345]. It would be helpful if future studies differentiate hookworm species now of growing importance with the worrying emergence of multi-drug resistant A. caninum [39 40].

Whipworms were identified in samples from all countries except Austria Ireland Switzerland and the Netherlands. Sampling of only a single city in Austria Ireland and Switzerland limited the ability to detect whipworms. The highest prevalence of T. vulpis was found in Italy which also had the highest prevalence of primary nematodes and the lowest-but-one percentage of owners reporting use of anthelmintic (Denmark had the lowest such use likely related to it being the only country in this study with a requirement for a positive test or clinical diagnosis before treatment can be dispensed [41]). Potentially a cause of severe illness and death due to the intermittent egg excretion and the high density of the eggs infections can often be missed by commonly used fecal flotation methods [42].

Combined used of the coproantigen immunoassay and centrifugal flotation technique detected an additional (approximately) 60% more positive results for nematodes than flotation alone (coproantigen: 6.2%; centrifugal flotation: 4.8%; combined: 7.6%) suggesting that there is a benefit from combining both tests for each sample. The higher proportion of positive tests from the coproantigen immunoassay could be related to the detection of prepatent infections that are missed by flotation. Samples testing positive on flotation but negative on immunoassay may be due to predation or coprophagia as evidenced by findings of spurious parasites not infective to dogs such as Eimeria spp. (2.8%) and strongyle eggs of herbivores (0.5%) or to the lack of sufficient antigen production from low-intensity infections [16].

Overall the results show that intestinal parasite-infected dogs are visiting and potentially contaminating public parks exposing other dogs to infection. While our protocol required the collection of samples from common canine exercise areas there was no comparison made between dogs in other areas such as those being walked on streets or whether dogs were on or off the lead. Consequently the results should not be seen as a problem exclusive to dogs being exercised in parks. What the results do show is that the cost of dog-owner failures to adhere to ESCCAP recommendations is the increased potential for their dog to be infected and to spread potentially zoonotic nematode parasites. That cost highlights the need for owner and veterinary education on the benefit of adherence to ESCCAP recommendations: (i) to pick up and carefully dispose of dog feces (which will also help to limit dissemination of potentially zoonotic Giardia); (ii) to test and treat “indoor” dogs for intestinal nematodes at least once or twice per year; and (iii) for the dog-owner population visiting parks with their dogs such as those included in the present study to administer an effective anthelmintic at least 4 and up to 12 times per year [15].",,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we sequenced and analysed a collection of 256 novel Serratia genome sequences and combined these data with 408 published genomes. Our total set of 664 genome sequences included those of 215 isolates from the original genus-defining Grimont collection sequenced here 205 multidrug-resistant S. marcescens isolates from UK hospitals isolated between 2001 and 201118 and an additional 41 more diverse Serratia isolates from UK hospitals sequenced here for comparison with the latter collection18.

We inferred the genus phylogeny from the whole genome data using a core-gene alignment-based approach (Fig. 1 Supplementary Fig. 1). It is evident from Fig. 1 that there are deep divisions within this phylogeny that correlate with both the current genus taxonomy and with species-level grouping calculated using genome-wide average nucleotide identity (ANI; clustered using a cutoff of 95 percent; Fig. 1 Supplementary Fig. 2). To gain a finer-scaled view we used hierarchical Bayesian clustering (FastBaps) to four levels in order to further subdivide the phylogeny and the species-level groups. In total we identified 7 16 23 and 27 clusters across the four levels respectively (Supplementary Fig. 3). FastBaps level 1 clusters comprise monophyletic clades reflecting individual or multiple ANI groupings within the genus consistent with speciation or species complexes39. The second and third levels reveal the presence of several subdivisions within some of the species-level phylogroups (Fig. 1 Supplementary Fig. 3). Hereafter we refer to the clusters set out by FastBaps level 3 as Lineages 1-23 (L1-23; Fig. 1).

Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree constructed from polymorphic sites of a core-gene alignment comprised of 2252 genes from 664 Serratia genomes comprising 408 genomes from publicly available databases and 256 sequenced in this study. Tree constructed with 1000 ultrafast bootstraps. The core-gene alignment was produced from a Panaroo pan-genome analysis run with ‘–clean_mode moderate’ and the protein family threshold set to 70% shared sequence identity. Branches are coloured according to phylogroups defined by clustering assemblies at 95% ANI. Clades are shaded according to lineage calculated through hierarchical bayesian clustering to three levels using FastBaps. ‘Labelled species’ refers to the labelled name of species on the provided Serratia strain sample or species name associated with published Serratia genome sequences in the NCBI GenBank database. The inset illustrates the frequent sources of isolation of each species21 with symbols representing water insects human plants and small mammals. The phylogenetic tree is reproduced in Supplementary Fig. 1 with the addition of the outgroup root the country of isolation for each strain and bootstrap values. Full size image

Interestingly within the tree there are two examples of singleton genomes occupying both a single ANI species-level phylogroup and representing a discrete FastBaps lineage (L16 and L23). Although both are situated within well-defined species these two singletons are hereafter referred to as ‘S. marcescens-like’ and ‘S. rubidaea-like’ for L16 and L23 respectively. Our phylogeny also resolves previous taxonomic discrepancies. Here based on the core-gene phylogeny the liquefaciens complex historically made up of S. liquefaciens S. grimesii S. proteamaculans and S. proteamaculans subs. quinovora is monophyletic (Fig. 1). Previous work had suggested S. proteamaculans be resolved into both S. proteamaculans sensu stricto and a subspecies termed S. proteamaculans subs. quinovora1021. However a species-level distinction between these two taxa rather than a sub-species one was subsequently proposed30. We observe that genomes labelled as S. proteamaculans and S. proteamaculans subs. quinovora form two separate ANI phylogroups in a monophyletic branch made up of L6-8 (Fig. 1 Supplementary Fig. 2). This supports the presence of two distinct species-level groups which we refer to as S. proteamaculans and S. quinivorans in accordance with the latter work30 thereby extending the membership of the liquefaciens complex to four species including S. quinivorans. Furthermore only a single genome links L7 and L8 into a single ANI phylogroup within S. quinivorans (Supplementary Fig. 4) which may suggest that a further sub-species separation within S. quinivorans is appropriate.

Concordance between historical biochemical phenotyping and metabolomic predictions

The current taxonomic structure of the Serratia genus summarised by Grimont and Grimont 200540 is based on 41 phenotypic and biochemical tests used to differentiate between different Serratia species or species-complexes. Many of the Serratia isolates originally used to define the genus taxonomy were sequenced here (Fig. 1; Supplementary Data 1) presenting a unique opportunity to reconcile this historical biochemical metadata with genomic predictions. First we calculated the genus pan-genome using a population structure-aware approach41. The pan-genome comprised 47743 discrete gene groups (Fig. 2a) of which 2252 were present in at least 99 percent of all genomes in the dataset (which would be defined as a traditional core genome) however only 1655 of these were present in at least 95 percent of genomes within each FastBaps lineage and therefore are core to all lineages (Fig. 2b). These 1655 genes are hereafter defined as the genus-core. From the 47743 genes of the pan-genome we predicted the metabolic potential of the genus. We identified 641 different complete metabolic pathways using Pathway tools42 (Fig. 3a) of which 260 were core to the genus being present in all known lineages (L1-23) (Fig. 3a Supplementary Fig. 9).

The presence/absence matrix is ordered by gene class as defined by Twilight. Gene class is first defined within each lineage by calculating whether genes are core (in ≥95% of strains in each lineage) intermediate (in >15% and ≤95% of strains) or rare (in ≤15% of strains). Classification of each gene group per lineage is then compared between lineages. Gene groups core to all lineages are collection core gene groups core to only certain lineages are multi-lineage core and genes core to only a single lineage are lineage-specific core. Individual genes found at intermediate or rare occurrence in all multiple or single lineages are classified similarly as intermediate or rare genes. These three classes are indicated by colour: core blue shades; intermediate pink shades; and rare orange shades. Genes which are in one classification (core intermediate rare) in a particular lineage but in another classification in a separate lineage are termed hybrid classes (green shades). b UpSetR plot showing the 40 largest intersections of lineage-specific core genomes (genes present in ≥95% of strains in each lineage). Lineages with membership to each intersection are shown by the presence of a black dot in the presence/absence matrix underneath the stacked bar plot. Stacked bar plots representing the number of genes in each intersection are coloured according to the gene classes assigned by Twilight where singleton lineages (here L22 and L23) have been included. Rows in the presence/absence matrix correspond to each lineage and are coloured according to Serratia species defined by fastANI.

Tables in c and d are adapted from Grimont and Grimont (ref. 21). Full size image

Of the 41 metabolic tests used to define species within the genus some were also used to define biotypes within a species. It can be seen that the fine-scale delimitation of biotypes within the liquefaciens complex generally agrees well with the phylogenetic structure we observe (Supplementary Fig. 10). Similarly ten of the 41 metabolic tests were used previously to split marcescens into ten biotypes which reflected differences in niche occupancy21. It is clear that these biotypes are also robust markers of phylogenetic subdivisions within this important species (Fig. 3c).

In silico pathway predictions were used to identify the genes and/or pathways linked to the biotype tests for S. marcescens where strain biotype metadata was available. Four of these ten tests (growth on m-erythritol trigonelline 3-hydroxybenzoate and lactose) were not investigated because there were no corresponding pathway assignments in the predicted metabolic network. Next the phylogenetic distribution of these metabolic genes was plotted across the phylogeny and extrapolated back to the most basal internal node differentiating two biotypes based on gene/pathway presence or absence (Fig. 3b). Where we had no genome representative of a particular biotype in which to identify the genes for the cognate pathway these were predicted using the results of the in silico metabolic prediction for known pathways (Fig. 3c). Although there are some discrepancies between pathway presence/absence and historical phenotypes for different biotypes Fig. 3b shows a robust linkage between inferred phylogeny and biotype. Across the species these data show that L15 corresponds with the pigmented biogroups A2 A6 and A1 whilst L14 L12 and L9 correspond with the nonpigmented biogroup A4 (L14) biotype TCT (L12) and biotypes A5 TT TC biogroup A8 (L9). Furthermore adding the source of sample isolation shows that niche occupancy also aligns well with the population structure and biotype data (Fig. 3c). In particular strains representing original biotypes described in the 1980s that were associated with hospitalised patients (TCT TC TT A5 A8) are situated in the same phylogenetic position as contemporary clinically-isolated S. marcescens implying important adaptations that can be linked to risk of disease or greater fitness in hospital environments.

Codon usage redundancy may facilitate a GC shift within Serratia

Changes in GC content of coding sequences over time have been hypothesised to reflect subtle differences in mutational bias as a consequence of long-term niche adaptation or different lifestyles43. Given that there are clear differences in the lifestyles and niches between Serratia species and intra-species lineages we investigated the distribution of GC content across the genus. We observe that Serratia is broadly divided into two phylogenetically-coherent groups based on whole-genome GC content: marcescens entomophila ficaria and rubidaea show a GC content of ~59% (59.0–59.9%) whilst odorifera fonticola plymuthica liquefaciens proteamaculans quinivorans and grimesii have a GC content ranging from 52.7 to 56.1% (Fig. 4a). The singleton S. rubidaea-like and S. marcescens-like genomes have an average GC content of 57.7% and 58.9% respectively consistent with their positions in the tree adjacent to rubidaea or marcescens. Additionally we observed that whilst there is a difference in the GC content of coding and non-coding regions of the same genome the difference in GC content between species is equivalent in both coding and non-coding regions (Fig. 4b).

Fig. 4: Serratia is split by GC content. a Histogram of GC content (average over whole genome) across Serratia. b Plot of GC content of coding regions against that of intergenic (non-coding) regions for each genome; a Pearson correlation test (two-sided) was performed giving correlation coefficient R 0.97 and p value < 2.2e−16 (n = 664). c Distribution of GC content in codon positions 1 2 and 3 in all genus-core (core) and non-genus-core (non-core) genes across each lineage.

To understand how this GC pattern impacts protein coding we investigated the variation in GC content over the three codon positions for all lineages using the genus-core set of 1655 genes (Fig. 4c; Fig. 2b) and separately for all other genes designated ‘non-core’. We observed no obvious difference in GC content between genes that were core or non-core at all three codon positions termed as GC1-3 (Fig. 4c). The GC content at GC2 is essentially fixed across the genus (Fig. 4c) whilst GC1 shows a slight skew across the genus varying by ~1%. Codon position GC3 showed a clear increase in the frequency of A/T-ending codons in low GC species compared with high GC species as expected44 (Fig. 4d). Hence the difference in average GC across the genus is largely explained by variation in codon position GC3. For example GC3 in S. grimesii is 20% lower than in S. marcescens L9 (Fig. 4c).

Taken together the variations in metabolic capability and GC content between both species and niche-adapted lineages are indicative of long-term niche adaptation within evolutionary timescales.

Pan-genome analysis highlights lineage-specific gene gain and loss as well as intra-genus gene flow

The results so far suggest that the pan-genome of Serratia lineages is phylogenetically constrained yet members of Enterobacteriaceae are known to have a highly plastic gene content through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). To investigate this further we sought to understand genus-wide species plasticity. Plasticity can be estimated by comparing the pan-genome size and complexity against the size of the genus-core gene set (Fig. 2a b). Given the uneven sampling of some taxa we performed a population structure-aware analysis of the pan-genome as noted above in order to define the ‘genus-core’ genome. We overlaid this classification system41 onto intersections of multi- and single-lineage core genomes (Fig. 2b). Genes were defined as core to a lineage if a gene was present in at least 95 percent of the genomes in each lineage and the union of all lineage-core genes was defined as the genus-core consisting of 1655 genes (Fig. 2a b). This analysis showed lineage- and species-level core gene gain and loss which are markedly larger in terms of the number of genes when looking at lineages that have a very small sample size. For example S. odorifera (L21; two genomes) and S. marcescens-like (L16; one genome) have 1725 and 345 genes core only to those specific lineages (Fig. 2b).

Variations in the pan-genome between different Serratia species were evident. For example whilst S. entomophila and S. ficaria display similar core gene branch lengths indicative of similar evolutionary timescales S. entomophila has a closed pan-genome whilst S. ficaria has an open pan-genome (Fig. 2c). The difference in the size of the accessory genome between these two species is 726 genes with S. entomophila and S. ficaria and having accessory genome sizes of 2764 and 3490 genes respectively despite S. ficaria being represented by fewer genomes in the analysis (Supplementary Table 1). This suggests that different Serratia species may have varying propensities for gene gain and loss.

Evidence of core gene gain and loss possibly reflective of speciation or niche adaptation can be seen when examining this data. For example 99 genes are found core to all three lineages in S. entomophila and 41 genes are found core to the entire S. liquefaciens complex which comprises S. liquefaciens grimesii proteamaculans and quinivorans (Fig. 2b). Within the pan-genome we identified lineage- and species-exclusive gene sets as well as those whose genes are also present at intermediate or rare frequencies across the genus (Fig. 2b). For example of the 99 S. entomophila species-core genes 35 genes were found across the rest of the genus (Supplementary Fig. 5) shared between both high and low GC members. In contrast in the 41 genes core to the S. liquefaciens complex very few are found outside the complex and where they are they are predominantly present in S. ficaria and S. plymuthica (Supplementary Fig. 6). The sharing of genes across the genus implying potential gene flow raises questions about whether GC3 has been ameliorated to reflect the GC3 trend in a potential recipient genome. Here we use the term ‘gene flow’ to refer to the apparent movement of genes across the genus based on their phylogenetic distribution which may reflect both gene losses or gains by mechanisms such as but not limited to deletion horizontal gene transfer or recombination. Of the 35 genes from the high GC species S. entomophila that are found across the low GC species S. liquefaciens complex S. plymuthica and S. fonticola the GC3 values of these genes are lower than when found in S. entomophila (Supplementary Fig. 11). Similarly S. liquefaciens complex core genes which are also found in S. ficaria and S. plymuthica both species with higher GC than members of the liquefaciens complex appear to have ameliorated GC3 (Supplementary Fig. 12).

In an attempt to understand the mechanisms by which genes are gained and lost we focused initially on S. marcescens. We investigated the genetic context of the metabolic gene loci associated with different biotypes. In doing so we identified a hypervariable locus analogous to the plasticity zone seen in Yersinia45. Variation in this locus explained some of the biochemical differences seen within S. marcescens. This plasticity zone is located between two sets of tRNAs: one encoding tRNA-Pro ggg  the other encoding tRNA-Ser tga and tRNA-Thr tgt . It encodes the genes required for gentisate degradation (nag gene cassette) and/or tetrathionate reduction (ttr gene cassette) present in the same order and orientation across the species located alongside three sets of genes that are variably present across the S. marcescens phylogeny (Fig. 5). These three sets comprise: (1) four genes including one encoding a cyclic AMP (cAMP) phosphodiesterase; (2) an acyltransferase; and (3) a two-gene toxin cassette. A gene predicted to encode a DNA damage-inducible protein I (dinI) is always present downstream of the ttr/nag/cAMP genes and upstream of the acyltransferase gene. In a small number of instances frameshifts have truncated or split coding genes in this region. Additionally prophage sequences can also be found flanking these variable sets of genes in some genomes (Fig. 5). Interestingly in L13 and L9 when the nag genes are present an additional gene encoding a protein with predicted 3-chlorobenzoate degradation activity is present 3′ of the other genes in the cassette (Fig. 5).

Fig. 5: A tRNA-associated hypervariable region (‘plasticity zone’) encodes gene cassettes for metabolic pathways used for biotyping within S. marcescens. The gene arrangement between the conserved tRNA-Pro ggg and tRNA-Ser tga in S. marcescens is plotted against a maximum-likelihood sub-phylogeny from the tree in Fig. 1. Clades for which all descending tips represent strains that have an identical set of genes in the locus depicted are collapsed and denoted by a diamond shape within the tree. The size of the diamond represents the number of tips in each collapsed clade. Tips lacking a completely assembled gene locus between tRNA-Pro ggg and tRNA-Ser tga have been pruned from the tree. Each tip number represents a unique combination of genes in the locus. Genes are coloured according to their role or in the absence of any predicted function named according to the group number assigned by Panaroo in the pan-genome (Fig. 2). Prophage regions and the closest related prophage sequence determined by PHASTER are indicated. Full size image

Further evidence of gene flow can be seen in S. marcescens (Supplementary Figs. 7 8). Certain genes core to S. marcescens L10 L11 and L14 were also found in members of other lineages including S. marcescens L15 and L9 and S. proteamaculans L6 (Supplementary Fig. 8). On closer inspection the genes shared with S. marcescens L15 and S. proteamaculans L6 comprise a Type VI Secretion System (T6SS). Whilst polyphyletic across S. marcescens this T6SS is syntenic when found in S. marcescens but is encoded in a different region of the chromosome when present in S. proteamaculans. In both cases this T6SS is encoded adjacent to a tRNA and also an integrase in S. proteamaculans potentially suggestive of horizontal transfer across the genus from marcescens. There are also 42 genes core to the clinically-associated S. marcescens L9 for which 37 are also found polyphyletically across the rest of S. marcescens (Supplementary Fig. 8). Many of these genes are predicted to be components of fimbrial usher systems (Supplementary Fig. 8).

Contribution of plasmids to gene content and flow varies across the Serratia genus

To understand the potential contribution of plasmids to the plasticity seen in this genus we searched for plasmid contigs in our genus-wide dataset. This uncovered 409 putative plasmids in 228 genomes and 9 species 301 (73%) of them present in S. marcescens (Fig. 6; Supplementary Data 2). The collection of identified plasmids displays a wide range of sizes (~1–310 kb) and GC content (~30–66%) indicating diversity. However the distribution of these traits varied amongst Serratia species (Supplementary Figs. 13–15). For example plasmids identified in S. marcescens and liquefaciens show a markedly broader range of size and GC content compared with those detected in S. entomophila and quinivorans. Seventy out of a total of 113 predicted plasmid replicons were found within S. marcescens L9 and L12 which are the ‘clinical’ lineages in which 97% and 81% percent of the isolates respectively are known to be human- or clinically-associated. In terms of mobility 296 (72%) of the plasmids were predicted to be conjugative or mobilisable (Fig. 6; Supplementary Data 2) highlighting their potential role in HGT. Consistent with this notion the predicted host range for this collection of plasmids ranges from single genus to multi-phyla with the most heterogeneous host range profile observed for plasmids found S. marcescens (Fig. 6).

Full size image

A network visualisation of the all-versus-all Mash distances46 calculated for the Serratia plasmids was used to explore their diversity. The resulting network comprises 113 clusters of which 53 (47%) correspond to singletons illustrating the diversity of Serratia plasmids (Fig. 6). Differences in plasmid abundance between clusters were evident from the network as four top clusters included 36% of the plasmids identified in Serratia genomes. Overall the plasmids clustering was concordant with their size and GC content but also with the host species (Fig. 6c Supplementary Fig. 15) suggesting limited between-species plasmid transfer within Serratia. Nevertheless some multi-species clusters were identified perhaps hinting at recent plasmid acquisition events. A cluster formed by plasmids of four non-marcescens species was the largest in the network. This cluster mainly consists of large MOBP conjugative plasmids related to the amber disease associated plasmid (pADAP) which is required for virulence of S. entomophila and S. proteamaculans in the larvae of the grass grub Costelytra zealandica1222. Interestingly whilst pathogenic potential in Costelytra zealandica is a defining trait of S. entomophila the presence of a pADAP-related plasmid was not universal or a defining trait for either S. entomophila or S. proteamaculans being found in members of S. entomophila S. quinivorans and S. proteamaculans and a single S. liquefaciens genome.

Notably the predicted host range of the plasmids brings an additional perspective on their potential dynamics within the genus. Most plasmids identified in S. marcescens appear to be restricted to this species within Serratia. Yet many of them have a predicted host range that goes beyond the taxonomic rank of family implying transfer outside the genus including two clusters of small ColRNAI plasmids predicted to cross multiple phyla (Fig. 6). In contrast the largest plasmid cluster (pADAP-like) featuring multiple non-marcescens species seems to be restricted to the Serratia genus. Altogether this picture may suggest that the ecological niche of S. marcescens has favoured plasmid exchange with diverse hosts outside the genus but has also promoted plasmid containment within the species in Serratia. The diversity of plasmids identified in S. marcescens and their predicted host range thus implies a major role for this species in the gene flow outside the genus and to a lesser but relevant extent within it.

A genomics perspective on a historical phenotype

A famous characteristic often popularly associated with Serratia spp. is the production of the red pigment prodigiosin17. However in fact prodigiosin production has only been observed in S. marcescens biogroups A1 A2 and A6 some rubidaea and some plymuthica isolates21. The pig gene cluster comprises fourteen genes (pigA-pigN) required for the production of prodigiosin47. Searching across the genus for pig gene cluster loci and flanking regions showed that consistent with the earlier biotyping observations the pig cluster is only encoded in certain S. marcescens S. rubidaea and S. plymuthica genomes (Figs. 3 7) which are associated with biotypes or biogroups known to be pigmented. In each case the pig gene cluster presents exactly the same contiguous order of genes (pigA-pigN). However notably it is found in separate genomic loci in each of the three different species as evidenced by the fact that the flanking regions upstream and downstream of the pig cluster are not syntenic between the different species (Fig. 7b). Representative pig gene clusters from each species share ~77–80% identity at the nucleotide level (Fig. 7b) which is similar to the shared nucleotide percentage identity between these species at fully syntenic regions in the chromosome. Given the different genomic contexts in which the pig cluster is present in these three different species it would appear that the pig gene cluster has been acquired horizontally on at least three separate occasions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZm1hbHRhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3N0cmVuZ3RoZW5pbmctcmVzZWFyY2gtaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi1rZWl0aC1henpvcGFyZGktdGFudGkuOTc4MTU10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Strengthening research innovation – Keith Azzopardi Tanti,"The sustainable growth and development of jobs are enhanced by research and innovation. Research plays a crucial role in the creation of new products and services that are innovative and which enable increased productivity industrial competitiveness and increased economic growth.

The capacity of our economy to spend more money will increase the efficiency and capital of our nation. This is why I believe that it is crucial for Malta to strengthen its partnership overseas in research and innovation.

During the past days I led a Maltese government delegation whcih participated in various meetings in the United States with NASA Ames Research Centre Illumina Stanford University and SpaceX.

The goal of the meeting at the NASA GeneLab was to strengthen existing partnerships between Malta-based principal investigators students and academics and experts in the field of life and space biosciences with the aim of increasing the usefulness of biological spaceflight experiments by facilitating access to research data and experimental materials.

NASA is a global leader in space exploration. During the last two years Malta has been represented in NASA’s open repository for space biology data by Prof. Joseph Borg. Through this global initiative students and specialists are able to explore and make discoveries about how life from earth is affected by the conditions of space.

So far Malta has participated in two space missions by sending a biomedical science experiment to the International Space Station. The first mission was sent in August 2021 on SpaceX CRS-23 and this year on SpaceX CRS-25.

Both missions as part of NASA contracted resupply missions were a success and data obtained from these two missions have been deposited at NASA’s GeneLab via our active participation to date. Together with Prof. Borg the Maleth Programme and its current missions were also presented during the visit.

Later we also took part in a discussion with Illumina company which included more in-depth scientific discussions on the use of illumine-based technology.

This is already available and is used to undertake numerous genomic tests for both research and diagnostic purposes. Commercial opportunities and business applications were also reviewed along with strategies for securing additional direct funding from Illumina for current and even brand-new programmes in Malta.

So far Malta has participated in two space missions - Keith Azzopardi Tanti

At Stanford University we met with Professor Joseph Wu the president of the American Heart Association where we discussed the opening of bilateral talks between the two nations and scholarship opportunities for young Maltese professionals to attend Stanford University and complete a portion of their studies there.

Research and innovation skill development and technical advancement are of utmost importance to multifactor productivity for nations such as Malta. It’s also essential to start closing the productivity gap for those who are catching up.

In fact research and innovation systems are crucial in boosting efficiency in the combined utilisation of our nation’s labour force and capital especially when combined with improved institutional and regulatory frameworks and effective market functioning.

Leading spaceflight business SpaceX has accomplished a number of firsts including the capacity to reuse rocket technology that has been used to go to and from low-earth orbit.

Additionally it is the first privately owned business to transport people to and from the International Space Station. Malta’s interest in enhancing satellite-based global data communication was a goal of the meeting with this company. The potential of Malta using Starlink to provide internet connectivity was also discussed as a way to further strengthen and diversify the services offered by the public and private sectors.

Research and innovation systems are intricate ecosystems that require a variety of components to function at their best.

These include a strong public science foundation that produces high-quality outputs together with active private sector involvement in innovation activities fluid and abundant knowledge flows among research and innovation actors and favourable framework circumstances that support commercial innovation.

Hardware leaker YuuKi_AnS has provided a sneak peek of what we could expect from Intel’s next-generation Xeon Emerald Rapids processors. It’s funny because Sapphire Rapids hasn’t landed but the specifications of its successor are already hitting the rumor mill. Although the leaker claims that the specifications came from a document allegedly distributed to OEMs recently we recommend you approach the information with an open mind.

Like Sapphire Rapids Emerald Rapids continue to rely on the Intel 7 (rebranded 10nm Enhanced SuperFin) process node. The forthcoming data center chips will slip into the same Eagle Stream platform with the LGA4677 (Socket E) socket as Sapphire Rapids. Intel hasn’t confirmed which microarchitecture will power Emerald Rapids though. Sapphire Rapids will come with Golden Cove cores; therefore Emerald Rapids would probably wield Raptor Cove cores.

While Sapphire Rapids have appeared to top out at 56 cores Emerald Rapids could push it up to 64 cores to match AMD’s EPYC processors. The problem is that Emerald Rapids will have very tough competition. AMD’s Genoa rocks up to 96 cores whereas Bergamo which launches in 2023 will have up to 128 cores. Intel is still behind AMD in terms of core counts.

Emerald Rapids' TDP may vary between 150W and 350W with excellent scalability. The processor support 1S 2S 4S 8S and higher configurations via xNC support. Four UPI 2.0 links per Emerald Rapids processor at a higher width (x24) offer transfer speeds up to 20 GT/s.

Eight-channel memory remains a feature on Emerald Rapids; however there is improved memory speed support. The processors natively support DDR5-5600 in a 1DPC setup and DDR5-4800 in a 2DPC configuration. The Eagle Stream platform will enable up to 16 DDR5 memory slots per socket. The specification sheet mentions support for 24Gb memory modules. Emerald Rapids also embraces Intel's Crow Pass Persistent Memory (Crystal Ridge 3.0) modules. Although Intel has canned its Optane memory business Crow Pass will still make it to the market. However the chipmaker won't develop any future Optane products beyond Crow Pass.

In terms of expansion Emerald Rapids deliver up to 80 PCIe 5.0 lanes. The platform provides PCIe bifurcation support at x16 x8 x4 and x2 via PCIe 4.0 speeds. The Emmitsburg chipset on the other hand supplies 20 PCIe 3.0 lanes 1G Ethernet for Manageability support and an x8 DMI connection restricted to the PCIe 3.0 standard. AMD hasn't share the number of PCIe 5.0 lanes for Genoa or Bergamo. For contrast AMD EPYC chips have been offering 128 PCIe lanes for a couple of generations now.

Unlike Sapphire Rapids Intel is confident that Emerald Rapids will meet its 2023 deadline.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL2ludGVsLWVtZXJhbGQtcmFwaWRzLTV0aC1nZW4teGVvbi1jcHUtZmFtaWx5LXNwZWNzLWxlYWtlZC11cC10by02NC1jb3Jlcy1kZHI1LTU2MDAtODAtZ2VuLTUtbGFuZXMtMzUwdy_SAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93Y2NmdGVjaC5jb20vaW50ZWwtZW1lcmFsZC1yYXBpZHMtNXRoLWdlbi14ZW9uLWNwdS1mYW1pbHktc3BlY3MtbGVha2VkLXVwLXRvLTY0LWNvcmVzLWRkcjUtNTYwMC04MC1nZW4tNS1sYW5lcy0zNTB3L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Emerald Rapids 5th Gen Xeon CPU Family Specs Leaked – Up To 64 Cores DDR5-5600 80 Gen 5.0 Lanes 125-350W SKUs,"Details of Intel's 5th Gen Xeon Scalable CPU family codenamed Emerald Rapids have been leaked by YuuKi_AnS over on Twitter.

Intel's 5th Gen Emerald Rapids Xeon Scalable Family To Feature Up To 64 Cores & SKUs Ranging From 125-350W TDPs

According to the leak Intel's Emerald Rapids-SP Xeon CPU family will be based upon a mature 'Intel 7' node. You can think of it as a 2nd Gen 'Intel 7' node which would lead to slightly higher efficiency. Emerald Rapids is expected to make use of the Raptor Cove core architecture which is an optimized variant of the Golden Cove core that will deliver 5-10% IPC improvement over Golden Cove cores. It will also pack up to 64 cores and 128 threads which is a small core bump over the 56 cores and 112 threads featured on Sapphire Rapids chips.

This will more or less match the existing EPYC Milan & Rome core counts but Genoa and Bergamo will be offering up to 50% & 2x core/thread count increase over Emerald Rapids and they will be available in full volume by 2023.

So talking about the platform details the Eagle Stream ecosystem will allow support for 125-350W TDP SKUs on the Socket E (LGA 4677) enabling drop-in support from Sapphire Rapids-SP. The HPC and data center segment will have immense scalability options ranging from 1S 2S 4S 8S and even more sockets (via xNC support) for increased compute and core densities. The chips will come with the latest accelerators including:

Intel Data Streaming Accelerator

Intel QuickAssist Technology

Intel Dynamic Load Balancer

Intel Advanced Matrix Extensions

Intel In-Memory Analytics Accelerator

Besides that the platform will enable support for faster DDR5-5600 (1DPC) and retain DDR5-4800 (2DPC). The 8-channel DDR5 memory platform will allow up to two DIMMS per channel for a total of 16 DIMMs per socket and each socket can support up to 24 Gb DRAM densities. There's also Crow Pass Persistent Memory support ""Crystal Ridge 3.0"" listed but with Optane canned that no longer seems to be the case. There will be four UPI 2.0 links running at a higher width speed of x24 for up to 20 GT/s transfer rates.

As far as PCIe lanes are concerned the Intel Emerald Rapids Xeon CPUs will feature up to 80 Gen 5 PCIe lanes per CPU in addition to PCIe 4.0 lanes from the North Bridge. The platform will support bifurcation of x16 x8 x4 and x2 (Gen 4) and will also support Shared Virtual Memory & Scalable IO Virtualization. The Emmitsburg PCH will offer 20 PCIe 3.0 lanes 1G Ethernet for Manageability and an x8 DMI connection rated at PCIe 3.0 speeds. For security the platform will offer:

Intel Trust Domain Extensions

Intel SGX With Integrity

TME-MK - 128 Keys

Platform Firmware Resilience (PFR) with Peripheral Device Attestation

Hardware Enforced Execution Controls

Intel VT-Redirect Protection (Formerly HLAT)

Intel Control-Flow Enforcement Technology (CET)

VM Denial of Service Prevention

By the time Intel released Emerald Rapids-SP Xeon CPUs AMD will already have released its Zen 4-powered EPYC Genoa & Bergamo chips so the Xeon lineup may end up being too little & too late with only Intel's advanced instruction sets backing them up in niche workloads. A good thing for Emerald Rapids would be that it will remain compatible with the Eagle Stream platform (LGA 4677).

Intel is also working on SNN and recently announced the Loihi 2 second-generation neuromorphic research chip with up to 1 million neurons (the human brain has 86 billion of those on average) that delivers up to 175x lower energy to learn a new object instance with similar or better speed and accuracy compared to conventional methods running on a central processing unit (CPU).

The new Loihi 2 neuromorphic chip offers the following improvement over the first generation Loihi:

Up to 10x faster processing capability (2x for simple neuron state 5x for synaptic operations 10x for spike generation)

Up to 60x more inter-chip bandwidth achieved through a combination of higher inter-chip signaling speed (4x) more inter-chip links (6 vs 4) and an over 10 times reduction in inter-chip bandwidth utilization

Up to 1 million neurons with 15x greater resource density

3D Scalable with native Ethernet support

Fully programmable neuron models with graded spikes

Enhanced learning and adaptation capabilities

A side-by-side comparison between Loihi and Loihi 2 can be found in the table below.

As a side note Loihi 2 should be on the first chip manufactured with Intel 4 manufacturing process. Intel says it used “a preproduction version of the Intel 4 process to address the need to achieve greater application scales within a single neuromorphic chip”.

The Loihi 2 neuromorphic chip works with the Lava open-source software framework designed to develop applications for neuromorphic hardware architectures. It currently works on CPUs and Loihi chips but its compiler and runtime are open to extension for other architectures.

Most people will access Loihi 2 through the Neuromorphic Research Cloud giving access to shared systems that currently include the “Oheo Gulch” single-chip system connected to an Aria 10 FPGA for early evaluation and will soon be joined by the “Kapoho Point” a compact (4×4-inch) stackable 8-chip system with Ethernet.

Intel has tested Loihi 1 & 2 chips for adaptive robot arm control visual-tactile sensory perception learning and recognizing new odors and gestures drone motor control with low latency in response to visual input fast database similarity search modeling diffusion processes for scientific computing applications and solving hard optimization problems such as railway scheduling.

Loihi is said to consume far less than 1 watt of power compared to the tens to hundreds of watts that standard CPU and GPU solutions consume so this type of neuromorphic AI accelerator may eventually bring the power of datacenter hardware to robots autonomous vehicles and so on and deliver similar performance at much lower power consumption and latency since the processing can be done on the device itself. Lower-end neuromorphic chips will leverage SNN’s efficiency in battery-powered sensors with built-in AI instead.

Intel Labs in collaboration with the Italian Institute of Technology and the Technical University of Munich introduced a new approach to neural network-based object learning that uses interactive online object learning methods. This approach gives robots the ability to learn new objects after deployment autonomously.

The approach is meant to make possible future applications like robotic assistants interacting with unconstrained environments possible. These robots could be at work in logistics healthcare or elderly care.

The method was tested using a robot in a simulated environment. The robot moves its “eyes” an event-based camera or dynamic vision sensor to actively sense objects. When the eyes track objects it creates events that are collected and used to drive a spiking neural network on a Loihi chip.

The spiking neural network architecture on the Loihi chip localizes learning to a single layer of plastic synapses and accounts for seeing objects from different angles by recruiting new neurons on demand. When the robot observes a new object its SNN representation is learned or updated and if the object is known the network recognizes it and gives the respective feedback to the user.

“When a human learns a new object they take a look turn it around ask what it is and then they’re able to recognize it again in all kinds of settings and conditions instantaneously” Yulia Sandamirskaya robotics research lead in Intel’s neuromorphic computing lab and senior author of the paper said. “Our goal is to apply similar capabilities to future robots that work in interactive settings enabling them to adapt to the unforeseen and work more naturally alongside humans. Our results with Loihi reinforce the value of neuromorphic computing for the future of robotics.”

Using the newly developed methods Intel’s team was able to demonstrate continual interactive learning on the company’s research chip Loihi. The chip used up to 175 times less energy to learn a new object with similar speed and accuracy as conventional methods running on a central processing unit (CPU).

The team’s research was published in the paper “Interactive continual learning for robots: a neuromorphic approach.”"

However monitoring sea ice has been difficult due to environmental conditions such as high winds and shifting distribution.

An international team of researchers led by Japanese scientists has compiled data collected during the MOSAiC observational expedition to analyze the ice-ocean boundary layer (IOBL) as it melted and refroze. With this data they were able to calculate the rate of growth and decline of sea ice.

“Owing to the complex patterns of heat and energy transfer the physics of the cold oceans is complicated” said study lead author Dr. Yusuke Kawaguchi of The Atmospheric and Ocean Research Institute at The University of Tokyo.

“Our objective was to quantify the thermodynamic growth and decay of the sea ice while incorporating effects of heat and salt exchange with near-surface water due to turbulent forces.”

By observing the sea from various angles and using data from the MOSAiC they determined that more ice was melting in the summer.

“Our first discovery was that in the summer strong winds cause the mixing of water where the ice and ocean meet. We were able to show that enhanced heat transfer occurs right below the sea ice” explained Dr. Kawaguchi.

The experts also found that due to more ice melting there was a drop in oceanic salinity which caused changes in the point when ice refroze.

“As melt water accumulates beneath the sea ice salinity of sea water decreases and then the freezing temperature increases. This terminates the melting of sea ice at an earlier timing because water gets easier to freeze” said Dr. Kawaguchi.

The team is looking forward to continuing their work with the hopes of creating an instrument that will simultaneously measure sea ice movement and salinity at the IOBL. With that simultaneous data researchers will have a more accurate view of what the ice is doing.

“The extent of the Arctic sea ice may affect the regional climate in distant places like Japan via atmospheric disturbances. We believe that studying the sea ice will allow us to better predict future changes in the Earth’s climate.”

This study is published in the Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans.

ASIA CUP 2022: FULL COVERAGE | SCHEDULE | RESULTS

The match for the intercontinental championship between Gunther and Sheamus was another highlight of the event which proved to be one of the best bouts in recent memory.

Here are the results from the WWE Clash at the Castle:

Madcap Moss and The Street Profits vs Austin Theory and Alpha Academy:

This fight got the show underway in a routine to warm up the crowd for the heavy match card for the event.

Madcap Moss Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford were pitted against Austin Theory and the Alpha Academy. After the initial exchange of blows there were bodies flying everywhere as Moss Dawkins and Ford combined flawlessly to overpower Chad Gable with a flurry of combination moves before Ford hit him with a frog splash to seal the deal.

-Madcap Moss and The Street Profits beat Austin Theory and Alpha Academy.

Bianca Belair Asuka and Alexa Bliss vs Damage Control (Bayley Iyo Sky and Dakota Kai:

This entertaining affair was a match that could have swung either way. Damage Control were intent on separating their opponents from the pack and they managed to do exactly so while Alexa Bliss was in the ring. A hot tag to Bianca could have turned the tide of the game before Bayley and Iyo came to the aid of their teammate Kai in the nick of time. After helping Kai connect a knee on Belair Bayle’s Rose Plant move and Iyo’s moonsault on the EST were enough to pack up the fight in favour of team Damage control.

-Damage Control beat Bianca Belair Asuka and Alexa Bliss

Intercontinental Championship: Gunther vs Shaemus:

An old-school beatdown featuring the two men was a solid match as the wrestlers obliterated each other. There were punches flying everywhere as Gunther got off to a great start taking the fight to Sheamus. But the Celtic warrior kept growing into the fight as he managed to hit the white noise. He even connected with a Celtic cross which he thought had done the deed but Gunther fought back to hit Shaemus with a deadly Lariat and defend his title.

-Gunther beat Sheamus

Smackdown Women’s Championship: Liv Morgan vs Shayna Baszler:

This was a topsy-turvy match in which Shayna Baszler was focused on taking the fight to Morgan who was put on the defensive due to Baszler’s aggression. Liv Morgan held on to deliver a knee to the head of Shayna before she pulled out of a two count. Shayna recovered and was looking to lock in the armbar but Liv smashed Baszler’s head into the turnbuckle before hitting the oblivion to pick up the victory.

-Liv Morgan beat Shayna Baszler

Edge and Rey Mysterio vs The Judgement Day (Finn Balor and Daien Priest):

Rey Mysterio and Finn Balor kicked off the fight as the judgement day managed to isolate Rey in their corner to go to work on him. However the veteran wrestler managed to tag his partner in to turn the tide of the game. He hit Balor with a 619 only for Priest to break the count at 2. Dominik Mysterio served as a distraction throughout the bout as he first prevented Priest from connecting a Coup de grace on Edge and came up with another distraction to permit Rey to use the 619 on Priest to pick up the victory.

However things turned sour as Dominik Mysterio hit both Edge and Rey while the pair were celebrating their win.

-Edge and Rey Mysterio beat The Judgement Day

Seth Rollins vs Matt Riddle:

Rolling started the match on a positive note as he took the offensive route. After some initial exchange of blows Rolling brutalised Riddle by pushing him into the barricade before sending him crashing through the announcers’ table. Riddle recovered to inflict some damage on Rollins who hit Riddle with his own move before talking smack to the wrestler. The direction of the match turned against as an out-of-control Riddle tried to end things with a chair after a flurry of chops to Rollins’ body. But Seth Rolling managed to evade the fatal attack and hit a stomp on his opponent to seal the victory.

-Seth Rollins beat Matt Riddle.

WWE Universal Championship: Roman Reigns vs Drew McIntyre:

The biggest fight of the night was a brutal one as McIntyre backed by his loud home crowd support got on the nerves of Roman who was miffed with the reception for the challenger. He levelled the Brit to lay him on the canvas and progressed to demand acknowledgement from the crowd before he finished things off. But McIntyre came back to throw Reigns around the ring as the Scot sent his opponent crashing into every piece of hard material available around.

The wrestlers traded blow for blow hitting each other with spear after spear nd when both fighters seemed to be running out of fuel in came Austin Theory in an attempt to cash in his money in the bank title but he was stopped by none other then Tyson Fury himself.

The two slugged it out before Reigns picked up the win thanks to an interference from Solo Sikoa The Uso’s younger brother to retain his title.

-Roman Reigns beat Drew McIntyre.

The Show

The adventures started with some lively dancing on the London roof tops with Mary Poppins and the Chimney Sweepers and ended with Aladdin and Jasmine dancing among the stars as the Genie (in an interesting mix of a skater and a video version utilizing Will Smith’s Genie from the 2019 film) granted Aladdin’s wishes.

In between were various skating vignettes showcasing characters and songs from several movies.

My personal favorites were Moana with Maui and the “Frozen” segment featuring Olaf with a dancing sun and butterflies.

Elsa also had a very creative performance to “Let It Go” which utilized snow falling on the side of the stage and two aerial acrobats.

The “Toy Story” segment included characters from all four movies including Forky Duke Caboom and my favorites Ducky and Bunny and had interactive game elements with the audience.

What To Expect

The show ran about two and a half hours with a lengthy intermission in the middle. Perfect for parents to take the kids on a restroom run or grab some more beverages and snacks.

During the show photographers roam the aisles taking snapshots of audience members which are then projected on the screens on stage making the audience part of the show. You can always decline with a wave of the hand and a shake of the head.

Select audience members even got to ride in Mickey and Minnie’s car during the show.

And being Disney this is a family-friendly show suitable for ticket holders of all ages.

Get Your Tickets

The show is in Orlando through today before it heads to Oklahoma City Oklahoma and beyond.

Tickets are now on sale for all 2022 dates at DisneyonIce.com. Select 2023 dates will go on sale later this month.

Once you purchase tickets share your magical moments on social media with #DisneyOnIce.

Disclosure: I am a Disney on Ice and Feld Entertainment media ambassador and received review tickets and other considerations in exchange for my support. As always my reviews are honest and my own.",,,

This compares to earnings of $1.54 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -0.65%. A quarter ago it was expected that this ingredients producer for food cosmetics and consumer products industries would post earnings of $1.61 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.30 delivering a surprise of -19.25%.

Over the last four quarters the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.

International Flavors which belongs to the Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry posted revenues of $1.27 billion for the quarter ended September 2019 missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.61%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $907.55 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

International Flavors shares have lost about 9.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 21.2%.

What's Next for International Flavors?

While International Flavors has underperformed the market so far this year the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s) but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release the estimate revisions trend for International Flavors was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.43 on $1.28 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.19 on $5.15 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank Consumer Products - Staples is currently in the bottom 31% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

The takeaway was that trade in goods as a share of GDP peaked around 2018 but the peak was not synchronised and some of the largest trading economies have not peaked. Sixty percent of the decline was due to a reduction in the value of commodities trade all of which was due to a decline in prices from the mid-2010s to 2020 (the recent spike in commodity prices started after that). The rest was due to unwinding or reshoring of international supply chains (Antras 2021).

The global peak of trade in goods as a share of global GDP is a wake-up call. The alarm clock is telling us that globalisation has changed. The previous columns in this series focused on the part of the change that stems from changes in trade in goods. This was a natural starting point since trade in goods makes up almost 80% of all world trade.

In this column I argue that the future of globalisation is not goods but services – in particular intermediate services. I will present economic logic and facts that support the idea that international commerce will shift to being dominated by trade that I called ‘telemigration’ in my 2019 book The Globotics Upheaval (Baldwin 2019).

The key fact presented in this column is that trade in services has not peaked in the way goods trade has (Figure 1). In sharp contrast to trade in goods trade in services continues to boom and shows no tendency to slow. Note that the scales are very different in the two panels.

Figure 1 Services trade vs goods trade (% of GDP)

Goods trade peaked; services trade did not

Source: Author’s calculations based on WTO (trade data) and WDI database (GDP data current USDs).

The individual economy trends show that non-peak behaviour is widespread when it comes to services trade. Figure 2 (left panel) shows scatter plots of the percentage-point changes in services trade for large traders (economies whose service trade amounts to at least half a percent of world services trade). All of the economies show growth both before and after 2008 except Greece which recorded a slight decline after 2008.

Figure 2 Total service trade before and after 2008; largest traders (left) and G7 (right)

Note: The vertical axis plots cumulative growth after 2008 (2008 to 2019); the horizontal axis plots cumulative growth before 2008 (1990-2008). Covid-19 seriously distorted services trade from 2020 so the chart stops at 2019. The large traders are China Ireland India Poland Korea Singapore Greece Brazil Malaysia Thailand Denmark Spain Ukraine Indonesia the Netherlands (NL) Türkiye Switzerland Finland Portugal Israel Philippines Hong Kong – China Australia Germany Sweden US Saudi Arabia Norway Canada France Chinese Taipei Austria Italy Japan Mexico. Together they account for over 85% of world trade.

Source: Author’s calculations based on WTO (trade data).

The pre-2008 growth is spectacular for many of the nations. While they started from low bases China Ireland and India experienced miraculous growth rates from 1990 to 2008 – all over 1000%. Those with over 500% growth include Poland Korea Singapore Greece Brazil Malaysia and Thailand. China’s growth rate was the highest at 3070%.

Growth did not stop in the post-2008 period. In the 12 years from 2008 to 2020 several of the big traders enjoyed service-export growth over 100%. The Philippines was the league leader with its 228% rise but was a slow starter (only 86% growth before 2008). India’s trade in services rose 1740% from 1990 to 2008 and 102% after 2018. For Ireland – which counts as a major service exporter since tech companies have moved their intellectual property there in pursuit of low taxes (and payments for intellectual property count as trade in services in today’s statistics) – the corresponding figures are 2362% and 179%.

The right panel of Figure 2 spotlights the G7 nations and again we see that all were non-peakers although Italy’s service trade stagnated in the second period. The growth numbers however are more moderate than the emerging economies in the left panel.

The pandemic and services trade: Sectoral decomposition

The pandemic hit goods trade in 2020 but this was more than reversed in 2021. Services trade was hit much harder since it includes international travel international tourism and transportation which were directly impacted by the lockdowns and mobility restrictions. Looking at the sectoral composition of services trade requires a bit of background.

The data on trade in services are in poor shape. They are not really fit to track the impact of trade in services on the global economy. One is nevertheless forced to work with the data that exist rather than the data one might wish for. In official statistics the high-level categorisation divides total services into three baskets. The first two are well understood and easily interpreted – travel (which includes tourism) and transportation. The third is ‘other commercial services’ (OCS). This is harder to explain than it should be for such an important element of international commerce.

OCS is a grab-bag of things ranging from people paying for their Spotify subscriptions and US companies hiring call-centre workers in Manila to payments to the giant Indian outsourcing companies and Gazprom paying Ukraine for transit rights through its pipelines. The pie chart in the right panel of Figure 3 shows the next-level disaggregation of OCS. Some of the services are recognisable but fully 40% is thrown into the ‘other business service’ category. All Indian service outsourcing and all the call centres are piled into ‘telecom computer & info services’ along with payments for international telecommunications. Bunching utility-like services (telecom) together with offshored software development is typical of the non-analytic organising principle that seemed to have been used in collecting the statistics.

Travel and transport dropped with Covid-19

Figure 3 shows trends of the three high-level categories. The first two categories were especially hard hit by Covid-19 and the accompanying lockdowns and travel restrictions. According to the latest data (2020) travel has still not recovered (for example China is still not easily accessible to travellers and the government discourages Chinese from leaving the territory). Transport services also suffered and have not recovered.

Note that the travel category like trade in goods did peak in 2008. This is to be expected as international transport services are closely tied to trade in goods. Travel and OCS did not peak and indeed OCS is still booming.

Other commercial services trade has grown much faster than goods trade

It is useful to focus on OCS trade since it is dominated by activities that – like trade in goods – are done in one economy and sold to another. Figure 4 shows that worldwide OCS flows have grown faster than trade in goods for decades (left panel) but the divergent paths became more pronounced after the 2008-09 Great Trade Collapse (Baldwin 2006). While trade in goods recovered in 2010 it has stagnated overall. By contrast OCS has continued to grow rapidly. Between 1990 and 2020 goods expanded five-fold while OCS multiplied by 11 times.

Figure 4 Trade in ‘other commercial services’ (OCS) has grown twice as fast as goods trade since 1990 and now constitutes 20% of all international commerce

Note: The series here are not as a share of GDP; they are values indexed to 1990 = 100 to stress the trends.

Source: Author’s calculations based on WTO (trade data).

The right panel shows how this has shifted the importance of services in international commerce. In 1990 OCS accounted for only 9% of all trade in goods and services but by 2020 that figure had tripled and its rise shows no sign of abating.

The future of globalisation is trade in intermediate services

I turn now to the argument I first made in Baldwin (2022) that the future of trade is services especially intermediate services. The argument boils down to four facts and a deduction.

First barriers to trade in most services are now orders of magnitude higher than the barriers to trade in goods (Benz and Jaax 2022) but many of today’s service barriers are technological rather than fiscal or regulatory.

Services are hard to tax at the border so most barriers arise from domestic regulation (OECD 2022). Much of this regulation however concerns ‘final’ services not ‘intermediate’ services. For example while there are strict rules for selling accounting services in the US there are few rules concerning the qualifications of the service workers that do the paperwork behind the provision of such accounting services. A US accountant can employ pretty much anybody to tally up a client’s travel expenses and collate them with expense receipts. The quality control burden falls on the sellers of the final service not government regulators.

Examples of occupations that provide intermediate as opposed to final services include bookkeepers forensic accountants CV screeners administrative assistants online client help staff graphic designers copyeditors personal assistants travel agents IT security consultants IT help staff software engineers lawyers who can check contracts financial analysts who can write reports and the list goes on and on.

The key point is that imported services are hard to tax when they cross the border. Protection of the domestic service sector relies on regulation. Most of the regulation however only applies to final services. Such regulation restricts who and how a service can be sold from a service provider to a final service customer. Generally these don’t apply to intermediate services. As a result the main barriers to trade in intermediate services are technical – for example the difficulties of coordinating work teams that include faraway workers.

The second fact is that digitech is rapidly lowering the technological barriers to trade in intermediate services.

These first two facts mean that service-trade barriers are falling radically faster than goods-trade barriers and are likely to continue doing so for the foreseeable future.

The third fact is that export capacity in emerging markets is not as great a limiting factor in services as it is in goods since every nation has a workforce that is already producing intermediate-service tasks.

All emerging market economies have lots of workers trained to do intermediate services domestically in all the occupations listed above. There is no need to develop whole new sectors build factories or develop farms or mines.

The fourth fact is that demand is not a limiting factor. Businesses in G7 nations spend a great deal on intermediate services – some of this could be provided by foreign-based workers.

A rough idea can be had by looking at all the tasks that were done remotely during the pandemic. Services are three times more important as intermediate inputs into domestic production than manufactures. The key role of trade in intermediate goods is widely recognised in the whole global value chain debate (Johnson 2014). What is little known is that intermediate services are vastly more important in leading economies. Table 1 shows for the French economy that at the level of the whole economy (bottom row) intermediate service inputs account for 30% of the total gross output while manufactured intermediates account for only 11%. Note that ‘gross output’ is GDP plus the use of all intermediates consumed in the production of the final value added.

Table 1 Intermediate services and manufacturing in the French economy 2018

Source: Author’s manipulation of calculations produced by Rebecca Freeman and Angelos Theodorakopoulos using the OECD’s inter-country input-output database. See Baldwin et al. (2022).

The deduction is simplicity itself.

Barriers are radically higher and falling radically faster for services versus goods and unlike farm and factory goods there is no capacity constraint when it comes to intermediate services. This suggests to me that the future of trade lies in services – in particular intermediate services.

Concluding remarks

Trade in goods has stagnated for a decade and a half. Trade in services has not. Goods trade is still larger but services now account for almost a quarter of export earnings globally. It also accounts for many export jobs especially for women since producing services is more labour intensive than producing goods.

The divergence between the growth of services versus goods happened because digital technology opened the door to trade in intermediate services and high-income countries have few or no barriers to this sort of exports. India for instance performed its service-export miracle without signing a single trade agreement.

Annex

This annex provides a more extensive look at some of the key empirical points in the main text. We start by looking at the key component of services trade: other commercial services (OCS).

Related work by international organisations

The most recent World Development Report leads to the same conclusion using a purpose-built categorisation of services trade (World Bank 2021). The publication points out that what they call ‘data-driven services’ have increased from about one-quarter to almost half of total service exports. In an important World Bank book Nayyar et al. (2021) look at how OCS is enabling ‘service-led development’.

The International Labour Organization’s flagship report (ILO 2021) which focuses on international freelancing points out that:

a trend has developed towards outsourcing work both low-skilled and high-skilled especially as traditional businesses look to digital labour platforms and digital tools to meet their needs for human resources. These platforms host workers from around the world enabling businesses to complete their tasks at a faster pace and lower price than if the tasks were performed on site. In many instances the work is outsourced on these platforms by businesses in the global North and performed by workers in the global South.

OCS scatter plot for large traders and the G7 economies

The main text of this column presented the facts for total services trade but that includes the peculiar categories of transport and travel services. Here we look at the OCS category alone since it presents a closer analogy to trade in goods i.e. where trade means things made in one country and sold in another.

Figure A1 (left panel) confirms the Figure 2 finding that individual economies generally do not display peaking behaviour. Thus in contrast to goods trade the non-peaking result is almost universal among large economies. The figure shows the scatter plots of the percentage-point changes in services trade for large traders (economies whose service trade amounts to at least half a percent of world services trade). All of the economies show growth both before and after 2008 except Italy which recorded a slight decline after 2008.

Figure A1 Other commercial service (OCS) trade before and after 2008; largest traders (left) and G7 (right)

Note: The vertical axis plots growth after 2008 (2008 to 2019); the horizontal axis plots growth before 2008 (1990-2008). Covid-19 seriously distorted services trade from 2020 so the chart stops at 2019. The large traders are US Ireland UK Germany Netherlands China France Japan India Singapore Switzerland Canada Italy Korea Spain Sweden Hong Kong China Austria Brazil Denmark Israel Poland Finland Taipei Norway Australia Thailand Philippines Malaysia. Together they account for over 80% of world trade.

Source: Author’s calculations based on WTO (trade data).

As with overall services trade the pre-2008 growth (cumulative from 1990 to 2008) is spectacular for many of the nations. China Ireland India Thailand Poland and Brazil had rates over 1000%. In the 12 years from 2008 to 2020 several of the big traders enjoyed service export growth over 100%. The Philippines was the league leader with its 227% rise but was a slow starter (only 230% growth before 2008). India’s trade in services rose 2680% from 1990 to 2008 and 110% after 2018. The right panel breaks out the G7 nations for better visibility. All but Italy were non-peakers.

Who are the big players in the trade in services arena?

The global shares of the largest OCS exporters are shown in Figure A2 (left panel). The top ten exporting nations account for about two-thirds of all service exports. The US UK Ireland Germany and the Netherlands alone account for about 40% of world exports. Adding in India and China brings the total to over half. The right panel shows that most of the large emerging economies are seeing faster-than-average growth in their service exports.

While advanced economies still account for the bulk of service exports worldwide the role of emerging economies is fast gaining pace. The biggest emerging market exporters of services are – in order – China India (with 5% of the world total each) Korea Poland the Philippines and Brazil. The world export of OCS has risen by 1.7 times since 2005 but the OCS exports from China and India for instance have almost tripled.

A more disaggregated look at trade in services

The OCS category consists of a few big items and many small items as Figure 3 illustrated. The largest sub-category (24%) is ‘other business services’ or OBS (Figure A3). Peeling off another layer of the onion the left panel of the figure shows the components of OBS. The largest categories are: professional and management consulting services (37% of OBS) and technical trade-related and other business services not elsewhere included. Disaggregated figures for the ‘technical trade-related and other business services not elsewhere’ category are not available for the whole world but some nations – like the US – provide more detail.

The right pie chart (which is based on US data since it includes a finer disaggregation than world data) shows the breakdown of ‘technical trade-related and other business services not elsewhere’. The big items are engineering services (38%); leasing services (19%); and other business services not included elsewhere (24%).

Evidence on trade in intermediate services

While official services-trade data fail to distinguish between final and intermediate services the OECD TiVA database does. Figure A4 shows that intermediates are more important in imported services than imported manufactures. For manufacturing intermediates account for about half and there has been some decline since 2008. For services the share starts out a bit higher and the gap widens.

Figure A4 Intermediates as share of imported services and manufactures 1995-2018 euro area 19 and UK (shares of own-sector imports 1995-2018)

Notes: TiVA data are only available for the 1995-2018 period. Imports in the charts are measured on the usual ‘gross’ basis (not value-added basis). Business services encompass all non-governmental services (the TiVA database categories of services do not line up with standard trade in services categories like OCS).

An inspired one-word tweet from the train company's Twitter account took off faster than a super speedy Shinkansen inspiring a Twitter trend toward extreme brevity.

""Trains"" the tweet says simply.

Less than 24 hours after the account tweeted the minimalist message it had been retweeted upward of 25000 times and gotten almost 168000 likes and over 2500 comments including responses from multiple brands sharing their own one-word descriptors.

""News"" The Washington Post tweeted. ""Radio"" wrote NPR. Marriott Bonvoy chimed in with ""hotels"" while Intuit Mailchimp went with an on-point ""emails"" and NASA opted for a sleeper: ""universe.""

President Joe Biden's official Twitter account joined in with ""democracy"" and CNET got on track with the trend too: ""tech."" As did CNET Cars: ""cars.""

Amtrak had a short-winded response -- ""trains"" -- to a request for comment about the tweet which has also drawn responses from railway fans sharing lovely views snapped from train windows plus lots of snark and puns: ""YES. Real trains. With wires. Electric!"" ""This tracks"" several people noted of the meme-generating tweet.

Amtrak joins Wendy's and others as just the latest seemingly old-school more traditional company to use social media to twist the perception of itself through bizarre posts that go viral and both charm and annoy the media masses. But perhaps none has been as succinct as Amtrak's. As my CNET colleague Queenie Wong details here companies try every trick stunt or ploy they can conjure up to capture eyes online sometimes with mixed results.

""This went from cute quirky tweet to stupid Brand Twitter meme in record time"" one Tweeter wrote of the ubiquitous one-word format spurred by Amtrak. ""I hate it here.""

Amtrak provides long-distance and inter-city rail service to 46 of the 48 contiguous US states and to nine cities in Canada. Because this is the internet we're talking about here Amtrak's one-word tweet has become occasion for Twitter users to respond not only with jokes but complaints -- about Amtrak specifically and more generally about mass transit in the US compared with that of Europe or Japan.

Will Jacobs produce enough to be on your fantasy football roster and what is his current ADP in fantasy drafts?

Josh Jacobs ADP | Is he worth his current price in fantasy drafts?

Jacobs’ current ADP is 42nd overall as the 21st wide receiver selected in fantasy drafts. This means he’s being taken in the third round of standard leagues. Other players drafted in his range include Breece Hall and Elijah Mitchell.

Our 2022 fantasy football rankings have Jacobs as the 47th overall player and 22nd running back. That’s the value of a low-end RB2 or quality Flex option. Compared with his ADP Jacobs is a fine value where he’s being selected and you can confidently roster his services.

Seeing Jacobs’ value settle a bit after seeing him start in the Hall of Fame Game is a good thing. In retrospect new head coach Josh McDaniels was giving Jacobs some time to take hits and feel the flow of the game. A few other new coaches used their starting backs as well.

This is contrary to our first takeaway from seeing Jacobs play with backups. The initial reaction was he was on the bubble. But it was his backup Kenyan Drake who would eventually be released.

It’s certainly not safe to believe Jacobs will reach the numbers of his first two seasons though. After producing 2215 yards and 19 touchdowns on the ground through two years Jacobs’ usage declined last year. Nevertheless he did log nine scores.

But adding McDaniels to the mix brings uncertainty for Jacobs’ fantasy value. Vegas also drafted Zamir White and Brittain Brown and signed Brandon Bolden. Jacobs has far more competition for situational touches.

Jacobs’ projected fantasy value in 2022

No fantasy manager will complain too much if McDaniels treats Jacobs as his Damien Harris. Harris received 21 more rushing attempts in the red zone for McDaniels and the New England Patriots than backup Rhamondre Stevenson in 2021. He converted eight more touchdowns than Stevenson offering fantasy managers 13 scores.

Can Jacobs reach that number or at least own this prime real estate in the red zone? Absolutely. He’s been one of the more effective backs across the league while in the red zone throughout his career. The only question is whether White steals any touches because he’s more of a physical runner who falls forward.

Still that concern seems secondary since Jacobs can also catch the ball and is a proven veteran. We haven’t seen White usurp those opportunities yet. This potential upheaval is already baked into his ADP — we don’t need to count it against him twice.

The most reasonable concern is whether the strength of Vegas’ opponents’ run defenses will deter McDaniels from being a balanced play-caller. Having a group of playmakers with Davante Adams Darren Waller and Hunter Renfrow is awfully tempting to get more pass-happy with Derek Carr. Vegas also faces the fourth-toughest schedule for running backs.

However Jacobs’ ADP is still a good price considering he will be a quality depth piece or low-end starter. Fantasy managers should be happy to roster Jacobs in his range considering the position takes a nosedive shortly after he’s drafted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhemV0dGUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2J1c2luZXNzLW5vdGVzLWZvci1zZXB0ZW1iZXItNC0yMDIyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Business Notes for September 4 2022,"The Gazette’s Business Notes is a compendium of the week’s promotions new hires certifications added business lines and business events among other items in Cedar Rapids Iowa City and the rest of the Corridor.

COLORADO SPRINGS Colo. -- Downhill skier Breezy Johnson has been banned for 14 months for three violations of anti-doping rules and can't race until December.

The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency published its decision late Monday for Johnson’s failure to comply with the whereabouts rules. They oblige athletes to detail where they can be found for one hour each day to give a sample with no advance notice.

Athletes have been banned for up to two years if they have three violations in a 12-month period such as missed tests or failures to update accurate details of their location.

Johnson’s whereabouts failures were on Oct. 29 2022 then June 13 2023 and Oct. 10 2023 USADA said. A seven-time podium finisher in World Cup races she left the circuit in December while under investigation.

USADA said 14 months was an appropriate ban for the 28-year-old Johnson because her “degree of fault was relatively low given the circumstances of the case.”

Johnson did not race in the World Cup last season and is not scheduled to miss any races next season in her specialist downhill and super-G events before the ban expires on Dec. 9.

“I apologize to my fans for letting them down and being unable to race this past season” Johnson wrote on social media adding “I made a human error and am paying those consequences.”

“See you at Birds of Prey” she wrote referencing her scheduled return to racing at Beaver Creek Colorado on Dec. 14-15.

The USADA ruling can be challenged by the World Anti-Doping Agency and the International Ski and Snowboard Federation on appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

Johnson’s race career peaked in a one-year period through December 2021 when she had three runner-up finishes and four third-places in World Cup downhills.

She missed the 2022 Beijing Olympics due to a knee injury she picked up three weeks before the games.

""One human here is illuminated today on Mother’s Day because she is blessed from the heavens above with kindness empathy compassion beauty and an abundance of musical talents that can only be God given with the voice and harmonies of an angel — all while being the greatest mama in the world to our babies"" began Johnson 52.

""The other human here ruins songs by making up vulgar lyrics followed by a very sinful laugh while confidently singing in keys that don’t exist — and upon being questioned about song structure he’ll simply insist 'We make up the rules'"" he joked. ""And I’m quite sure there’s tequila in his energy drink can.""



""Happy Mother’s Day @laurenhashianofficial. Mimi & Aja too. #playitagainSAM 🥃"" Johnson concluded.

Johnson and Hashian began dating in 2007 and later welcomed daughters Jasmine 8 and Tiana 6 before going on to tie the knot in 2019. (The Jungle Cruise actor is also dad to 22-year-old daughter Simone Johnson with ex-wife Dany Garcia.)

Hashian who is a musician previously showed off her vocal talents last Thanksgiving when she joined Johnson and musician Eric Zayne for a little session at the piano.

In a clip shared by Johnson on Instagram Zayne played the piano as Hashian sat on a chair next to him and they both belted out the lyrics to Billy Joel's ""Just the Way You Are"" with the actor joining in as he leaned over the top of the grand instrument.

""A lil’ Thanksgiving tickling of the ivorys with the two beautiful voices and talents of @laurenhashianofficial & @ericzayne and me just making up lyrics to an all time classic @billyjoel"" Johnson wrote.



Hashian is equally fond of her ""amazing man"" having posted a sweet tribute to the actor earlier this month in honor of his birthday alongside a photo of Johnson holding their girls.

""I do not want to let this birthday go by without saying the gratitude I feel to spend each birthday with you just gets more special and more sentimental every year … to have so many years under our belts"" she began. ""And yet also feel so many new things are just beginning in our lives especially as our little girls are just taking this world by the reigns and making each day so FULL of Life! Discovery! Laughter! And Love!""

Hashian went on to thank Johnson ""for the endless blessings you bring to our world"" as well as for being their family's ""leader"" for his ""love"" for his ""desire for growth"" for his ""inspiration"" and for his ""big strong hugs.""

""Thank you for how you root us give us a beautiful foundation to stand on and keep us safe and warm in your energetic embrace. I LOVE YOU YSHSOAG! The day you were born is a true celebration!!! WE LOVE YOU!!!"" she concluded.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson had few misgivings but like many mayors before him said his toughest challenges are what he inherited.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson had few misgivings but like many mayors before him said his toughest challenges are what he inherited.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson had few misgivings but like many mayors before him said his toughest challenges are what he inherited.

CHICAGO (WLS) -- In the Ceremonial Room of his fifth-floor office in City Hall Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson reflected on his accomplishments on Monday.

""I'm very pleased of how we've gotten out the gate thus far"" Johnson said.

ABC7's Terrell Brown asked Johnson what he thinks he could have done better over the course of this last year.

The mayor had few misgivings but like many mayors before him said his toughest challenges are what he inherited.

""I wish that we didn't have so many years of neglect and disinvestment. There are things that I want to move faster"" Johnson said.

Brandon Johnson is reflecting on being a father and mayor of Chicago.

As Brown pointed out Johnson was elected to fix those things.

""All of them right? Yeah. You know so I really wish that you know the hole was not as deep"" Johnson said.

Front and center has been the migrant crisis. The mayor is now confident that it is under control.

""No other city in America has been able to handle this crisis as well as we have. If there is someone out there that's doing it better than Chicago I would like to know because we certainly will take notes"" Johnson said.

And if buses show up during the Democratic National Convention Johnson said ""We're preparing for it.""

When asked whether he is expecting buses during that time Johnson said ""We don't need to expect it.""

""We have structured our migrant temporary shelters to be able to manage this crisis a little better"" the mayor added.

The DNC is part of Chicago's busy summer which is also when crime is historically at its worst.

""Since I've been in office homicides and shootings continue to go down. Vehicular carjackings has gone down"" Johnson said.

But an ABC7 data analysis found robberies in the last 12 months are up compared to the last three years.

""Look there's still a lot of work to be done. Don't misunderstand me"" Johnson said.

The mayor campaigned on a promise to end ShotSpotter the gunshot detection system that alerts police to shootings in the city.

READ MORE | Chicago will not renew controversial ShotSpotter contract drawing support criticism from aldermen

Johnson has been adamant about ending ShotSpotter. When asked why that is he said ""Oh because it didn't work.""

However the city is planning to keep the technology around through the DNC.

""I'll work with the corporation to phase it out so that there's a deeper opportunity to give them the chance to provide more substantive research of its benefit"" Johnson said.

Chicago Police Department Superintendent Larry Snelling and the police union have insisted that ShotSpotter is a valuable tool.

When asked if he believes Chicago police officers respect him Johnson said ""Absolutely. Yeah absolutely. And I respect them.""

But some officers say they don't feel like Johnson has their backs. Brown asked what Johnson's message is to those officers.

""I'm grateful to have the support of police department and my entire administration support the men and women who show up every single day risking their lives"" the mayor said.

Johnson said he has upheld his commitment to officers by extending their contract and aims to do the same with upcoming Chicago Teachers Union negotiations.

""So to taxpayers who look at this contract negotiation and they're a little leery"" Brown pointed out.

Johnson responded ""They don't have to be. I have the vision for a public education system that expects every single child to have everything that they need. Who's in disagreement with that? No one's in disagreement with that.""

Brown also asked Johnson as a former school teacher how he would grade his first year in office.

ABC7's Terrell Brown asked Mayor Brandon Johnson how he would grade his first year in office.

""Well first of all it has really been the joy of my life serving in this capacity. I really wish more people could see the view of the city of Chicago through the lens of a mayor. You know we've made critical investments of fighting this homelessness crisis a quarter of $1 billion $100 million for violence prevention. We have this big bond deal $1.25 billion to build homes and to create economic development"" Johnson said.

But the mayor added ""Until we have the type of economic stability within all of our communities I actually don't believe that any politician should be walking around patting themselves on the back.""

What do Chicagoans think about Mayor Johnson's first year in office?

Brandon Johnson is getting mixed reviews from Chicagoans on issues like crime the migrant crisis and his dealing with the business community.

Meanwhile ABC7 political reporter Craig Wall has been hearing from people directly affected by the Johnson administration's policy decisions.

Wall spoke to various stakeholders to get their evaluations on things like crime the migrant crisis and Johnson's dealing with the business community.

As with any first-year politician the mayor got mixed reviews. He had some wins some failures and some things where he's still considered a work in progress.

Chicago crime is one example. Though homicides and shootings are down armed robberies are up.

""I feel like the mayor is not making violence a top priority"" Purpose Over Pain founder Pam Bosley said.

Purpose Over Pain helps families who have lost loved ones to gun violence. Bosley met with Johnson before he took office and he promised her he'd be a collaborator. She hasn't heard from him since.

""So I'm talking to moms and dads every single day who's losing their children. And I feel like the mayor is not talking about it. He's not saying anything. If it's a police shooting they address it. But when is the day-to-day crime nobody says anything"" Bosley said.

On the migrant crisis Johnson inherited a situation where hundreds of new arrivals were sleeping in police stations. He has since gotten them into shelters.

Annie Gomberg coordinated volunteers helping in Austin and she continues to help migrants.

""We looked for leadership. We looked for planning. We looked for expertise"" Gomberg said.

But instead Gomberg said they found a lot of excuses.

""I understand this was really hard and I don't think anybody doesn't think it was hard but also he campaigned for this. He told us he wanted the job. This was part of the job"" Gomberg said.

Then there's the business community which was very leery because of Johnson's progressive agenda.

""I definitely think there's been some ups and downs and positives and negatives. There's definitely been an extended learning curve and period of time for the business community to get to know the mayor and the mayor to get to know the business community"" said Jack Lavin Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce president and CEO.

Those who supported the mayor's efforts to get rid of tipped wages sing his praises.

""I will give him an A because he historically abolished to end sub-minimum wage"" said Nataki Rhodes with One Fair Wage.

And Johnson's former campaign rival state Rep. Kam Buckner said Chicagoans should be patient.

""I think it's fair to give him more than a year to figure things out"" Buckner said.

While Johnson has succeeded in pleasing progressives who helped get him elected another state representative La Shawn Ford told Wall that Johnson needs to learn how to be the mayor for the whole city not just his base.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpbHZlcmFuZGJsYWNrcHJpZGUuY29tLzIwMjQvNS8xMy8yNDE1NTc0MS9yYWlkZXJzLWRyYWZ0LTIwMjQtamFja3Nvbi1wb3dlcnMtam9obnNvbi1zaWduZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Raiders draft 2024: Guard Jackson Powers-Johnson is signed,"There are no current unsigned Las Vegas Raiders players on the 2024 roster.

- Signed second-round draft pick (44th overall) G Jackson Powers-Johnson — Raiders PR (@RAIDERS_PR) May 13 2024

Powers-Johnson is expected to have a strong chance to start at guard this season. He was the last of the Raiders’ eight-player 2024 draft class to sign his contract.

The Las Vegas Raiders announced they have signed first-round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft tight end Brock Bowers and five of the team’s other draft picks Thursday.

Bowers’ deal is reportedly a four-year contract for $18.1 million with a $10 million signing bonus and the customary fifth-year option available for all first-round picks according to NFL Insider Ari Meirov. The Georgia product was a surprise pick on Day 1 of the draft but is expected to play a major role in Las Vegas’ offense this fall.

Thursday the Raiders also announced they’ve agreed to terms with Mississippi State cornerback Decamerion Richardson Ohio State linebacker Tommy Eichenberg New Hampshire running back Dylan Laube Air Force safety Trey Taylor and Pittsburgh cornerback M.J. Devonshire.

The Raiders who held their rookie minicamp Friday and Saturday signed third-round pick tackle DJ Glaze of Maryland on Friday."

3 Fintech News Stories

#1: Marketers’ Dark Arts

What happened?

Credit Karma got in some trouble with the FTC:

The Federal Trade Commission has taken action against credit services company Credit Karma for deploying dark patterns to misrepresent that consumers were “pre-approved” for credit card offers. The FTC alleges that the company used claims that consumers were “pre-approved” and had “90% odds” to entice them to apply for offers that in many instances they ultimately did not qualify for. The agency’s order requires the company to pay $3 million that will be sent to consumers who wasted time applying for these credit cards and to stop making these types of deceptive claims.

So what?

Three things here.

1.) One of the easiest ways to get into regulatory trouble in fintech is to use overly optimistic marketing language that can be reasonably seen as deceptive. This is example number 12287907456 of this being true.

2.) This line from the FTC’s press release is a bit concerning (h/t: Jonathan Joshua):

According to the FTC’s complaint Credit Karma knew that its purported “pre-approvals” conveyed false “certainty” to consumers based on the results of experiments also known as A/B testing showing that consumers were more likely to click on offers saying “preapproved” than those saying they had “excellent” odds of being approved. When user interfaces are designed including with the aid of A/B testing to trick consumers into taking actions in a company’s interest and that lead to consumer harm such design tricks have been described as “dark patterns.”

The purpose of A/B testing is to figure out which designs marketing language graphics etc. will be most effective in getting a customer to do something. A/B testing is a foundational best practice in marketing UX design product management and many other fields. I’m not sure if the FTC intended to convey the message that all A/B testing should be considered “dark patterns” but that is certainly the implication.

3.) More broadly the way that Credit Karma (and most companies that do customer acquisition in consumer banking) does pre-qualification needs to change. The default model for pre-qualification in the U.S. today is to get a consumer’s permission to “see if they qualify” for a lending product and then soft pull their credit file and evaluate it using the lender’s qualification criteria and then letting them know if they are pre-qualified. This process isn’t ideal from the consumer’s perspective because it’s not a guarantee. They still have to officially apply for the lending product that they are pre-qualified for and face the possibility that they won’t actually be approved.

There is a better way. It’s not common these days but instead of “consumer-initiated prequalification” lenders (and third parties like Credit Karma) can do “instant prescreen” in which a consumer’s credit file is soft pulled without their knowledge and if (and only if) they pass the lender’s qualification criteria they are presented with a firm offer of credit. No need to apply or face the possibility of being declined. There are certain constraints on how you can do “instant prescreen” but it is absolutely possible and I’m honestly a bit confused as to why more companies don’t do it this way and avoid the problems Credit Karma just ran into.

#2: Bank of America Helping Black and Hispanic Americans

What happened?

Ohh hell yes:

Bank of America Corp. started a trial program aimed at helping first-time homebuyers in Black and Hispanic neighborhoods by offering mortgages that don’t require down payments closing costs or minimum credit scores all considered longtime obstacles to narrowing the gap between White and minority ownership.

So what?

This is part of a larger wave of innovation some of it driven by the government and some of it driven by private companies to close the racial homeownership gap which is one of the most important drivers of the racial wealth gap.

An important part of this initiative by Bank of America is the caution it is exhibiting in not getting Black and Hispanic consumers into financial situations they won’t be able to handle:

Customers using the program will be evaluated for a home loan not by credit scores but rather factors such as their history of making rent utility phone and auto-insurance payments on time BofA said in a statement Tuesday.

Under the BofA program the lender is giving homebuyers down-payment grants of $10000 to $15000 so they have immediate equity in their homes.

#3: Originating Credit Cards Without Credit Scores

What happened?

Related to the Bank of America news above Citi is joining Project REACh:

Citigroup is joining a government-sponsored effort to expand access to credit in underserved communities. The bank is launching two pilot programs early next year under the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s Project REACh or Roundtable for Economic Access and Change. One program will issue credit cards to people without credit scores Banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. Wells Fargo & Co. and U.S. Bancorp are already working with Project REACh sharing bank-account data to help approve a wider swath of borrowers for credit cards.

So what?

This is the critical part of the story:

bankers say loans issued through Project REACh though small in number are performing as well as those issued outside the program. They expect the volume to increase in the coming year.

Fintech companies like Petal have been saying for a while that you can safely originate credit invisible consumers for credit cards – regular old credit cards not those funky credit builder cards – using cash flow-based underwriting.

With a nudge from the OCC the big banks are discovering that yes indeed you can.

It would be just lovely if this became the default approach to origination for all entry-level credit card products – use cash flow-based underwriting to approve applicants and then use the resulting performance to approve or decline them for more premium cards down the line.

2 Fintech Content Recommendations

Patrick McKenzie has a wonderful habit in writing his blog – Bits Amount Money of saying the quiet parts out loud. Financial services is built on all kinds of assumptions and unspoken agreements which tend to have significant downstream impacts on financial services companies businesses and consumers. Those impacts are not always well understood.

In this post Patrick explains why fraud (unique among all other types of crime) is the result of policy choices made by non-state actors (read: companies) and what those choices tell us about the priorities of those actors.

Fascinating stuff.

The intersection of BaaS and regulation is Jason Mikula’s sweet spot. After reporting on some rumors swirling about regulatory headwinds starting to impact BaaS banks and platforms Jason’s most recent newsletter breaks down the news that Blue Ridge Bank and the OCC have entered into an agreement that will govern how Blue Ridge manages compliance and risk in its growing banking-as-a-service business.

This is a must-read for everyone in fintech.

1 Question to Ponder

If you could wave a magic wand and instantly change one thing in fintech or in the broader financial services industry what would you change?

I asked Michael Sindicich of TripActions this question in Episode 1 of The Fintech Factor (my new podcast which you should absolutely subscribe to!) and I thought he had a GREAT answer. I’m curious – how would you answer this question?

In it he explained why on that fine April day in 2022 he and 1200 other scientists all over the Earth would risk arrest to protest Chase the world’s biggest financier of climate-killing fossil fuels. (Citi and Bank of America are close behind.)

“We [scientists] have been telling you guys for so many decades that we’re headed towards fucking catastrophe” Kalmus said. The clip went viral probably in part because when Kalmus told the cameras (and waiting cops) that he was committing nonviolent civil disobedience “for my sons” he began to weep — and didn’t stop. Their protest he said brokenly was for “all of the kids of the world all of the young people all of the future people.”

Kalmus is one of thousands of parents worldwide organizing around a similar rallying cry: We love our children. We won’t let you wreck their world.

A couple decades ago there were few if any family-focused environmental organizations let alone the kind of parent-led climate justice groups now confronting polluters and the systems of racism colonialism patriarchy and extractive capitalism that enable them. In the U.S. Mothers Out Front began to organize in several states in 2013 and two years later mothers in some chapters of the climate action group 350.org launched subgroups centered around families and the parental imperative to protect children from harm.

Then in 2018 Greta Thunberg and her school strikes took the world by storm. Though some young people were already leveraging their moral authority in court to demand that adults stop trashing their future the Fridays For Future school strikes — and Thunberg herself — received spectacular media attention. They electrified the burgeoning global youth climate movement and inspired the offshoot group Parents For Future Global that now boasts hundreds of parent-led grassroots groups in 23 countries. (You can join the next global strike September 23.) Other mom-led groups have since sprung up worldwide including in the U.K. India Pakistan and Canada.

I asked four parent-focused organizers how one might begin to parent toward climate justice.

Brooklyn-based Chandra Bocci a fellow with the international parent-climate network Our Kids Climate and Parents For Future Global says that parenting toward climate justice is not about “a perfect zero-waste lifestyle.” Given humanity’s short time frame to slash emissions enough to keep warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius she advocates collective empowerment and action that’s targeted strategically. “Showing children that we have a window where we can do something — and that we are doing something — is so important.”

For Bocci and her preschooler that meant joining parents from Climate Families NYC at a 2021 protest in front of the home of Larry Fink CEO of BlackRock the world’s largest asset manager. BlackRock with its nearly $260 billion invested in coal oil and gas projects worldwide had long been a focus for Bocci and other parent climate organizers. When they learned that Fink lived near several of them they felt a responsibility to appeal directly to the father of three to use his outsize influence to divest BlackRock from climate destruction.

“I think that was only the second time he had talked in person with any activist group” Bocci said recalling that Fink came out to meet them. “Because of our position as parents with kids we have a different approach and a different kind of moral authority from other activists showing up. We keep very positive but we’re not scared either.”

Parents working in some conservative communities can face massive challenges on the climate justice front says Winona Bateman executive director of Missoula Montana-based Families For a Livable Climate (FLC). In Montana she says “we have folks trying to make voting more difficult for our tribal communities and Indigenous nations. There are definitely racist dog whistle political signals that get thrown around in our state. That’s a challenge because those are triggers for people.”

Bateman is not daunted. “The data around how people feel about climate change and the danger it presents to the world is pretty strongly in our favor” she says. “Even in Montana over 60 percent of people agree it’s happening and there’s strong support for corporate action and renewable energy as part of our future.”

To engage that 60 percent and “create community for climate action in Montana” (FLC’s stated mission) FLC offers education on creating zero-waste schools talking to kids about the climate crisis and moving from climate despair to action. Those ready for political action can petition utilities to transition to clean energy or support the kids taking the state of Montana to trial next year for violating their right to a clean and healthful environment.

But a predominant focus says Bateman is helping parents feel comfortable talking about climate justice with people across cultural and political divides: “People need space to shift and they can’t get there if no one can have a conversation with them about it. If you just yell at them they’re not going to be able to shift.”

On September 27 FLC will offer a virtual discussion with Katherine Hayhoe about her 2021 book Saving Us: A Climate Scientist’s Case for Hope and Healing in a Divided World. Hayhoe who has children is widely praised for helping climate advocates find common ground with a broad range of people based on shared values.

A challenge for several parent climate action groups including Bateman’s in Montana is that they’re sometimes made up of all or mostly white middle-class women. Bateman doesn’t shy from this fact or the daily work required to create a just and equitable future for everyone.

“We try to make sure we’re bringing lots of different perspectives and voices into the work we’re doing and to how we’re understanding things.” To deepen her own understanding Bateman a descendant of settlers in North Dakota took a “deep dive” into her own family tree. “My family settled along the Knife River of North Dakota; the lands of the Mandan Hidatsa and Arikara Nation (Three Affiliated Tribes).”

“The challenge for white people in the movement” she said “is to step up and engage folks who are not thinking about how climate is disproportionately impacting people of color and people of low income.”

Lorna Pelly based in British Columbia tries to raise kids who understand the world isn’t fair and contribute toward correcting injustices. In her work with For Our Kids (FOK) a network of over 20 active parent-led chapters across Canada she begins with recognizing that the climate crisis impacts people unequally. “It will always be the lower-income people or countries that are affected the most and have a harder time rebuilding after climate disasters” Pelly said. “I’ve never been able to sit well with that knowing that it’s the more developed countries causing [more of] the carbon emissions.”

FOK trains parents in “Curious Climate Conversations” and supports Wet’suwet’en Land Defenders Indigenous communities fighting Coastal Link Gas and its attempt to force a new pipeline through their unceded territory. Many parents have been shocked says Pelly to learn about the racism of Canada’s police force and FOK now offers workshops on raising anti-racist children. (You can join this September 17 workshop.)

For the growing number of parent groups in the Global South movement-building is both more urgent and more difficult organizers say.

“Parenting toward climate justice means something very different to us here in the Global South than it does to you in the North” says Amuche Nnabueze a Nigerian organizer with Parents For Future Global. “We are already suffering the effects of climate change in every aspect of our lives. There is so much poverty. We do not even have water clean water. There are droughts and floods. Rivers are drying up.”

During our interview the power went out twice plunging Nnabueze into darkness. Nigeria is well-known for its entrenched political corruption that makes it hard for citizens of the densely populated African nation to even discuss human rights or feel safe traveling to events in other cities for fear of kidnapping. Many people are hungry says Nnabueze and lack health insurance. All of this together can create indifference when she reaches out to parents through local organizations her academic and social circles and her church urging them to join for example the upcoming global climate strike on September 23.

“Poverty drives this indifference” Nnabueze says so she works to connect where she can spearheading advocacy campaigns and encouraging others to lifestyle changes such as reducing plastic consumption.

“Parents really connect to lifestyle changes so we talk about things they can do.” Climate advocacy in Nigeria can’t be only about climate strikes because she says with a laugh “we are not really sure what the government will do.”

Nnaueze’s three children join the parent-led events and her daughter 17 organizes Green Teens Africa which focuses on sustainable lifestyle skills. “We parents are supporting them through sharing our ancestral and Indigenous knowledge about growing crops subsistently waste management permaculture and more based on our Indigenous circular economy model.”

Nnabueze felt boosted by the year-long Parent Climate Fellowship that gave her training financial support and the opportunity to travel to Glasgow last year for COP26. It was powerful she said to join other climate organizers and bring her voice to the global stage.

Nnabueze continues to network with parent climate organizers worldwide informing the work of parents in the Global North through regular online meetings with international parent networks such as Our Kids Climate and Parents For Future Global.

She and many other Global South parent organizers are impacting groups in the Global North including all of those mentioned above who do their best to learn educate their members and then try to help in their own communities.

In her work with New York City parents Bocci tries to follow the lead of environmental justice-centered organizations. “We’re not reinventing the wheel. We’re really paying attention and reaching out and collaborating and partnering and following calls to action from BIPOC and working-class [groups] in our state” she said.

New York Renews a statewide coalition of over 300 grassroots groups centers environmental justice in their work and has developed a clear legislative agenda. “A lot of what we do is follow their lead and just jump on their campaigns and amplify them. Then we show up in support. We ask ‘How can we help?’”

The match was expected to be the last match of her transcendent tennis career on Friday night. Williams ended in the third round on Friday with a 7-5 6-7 (4/7) 6-1 loss.

Waving everyone good bye an emotional Serena said “I wouldn't be Serena if there wasn't Venus. So thank you Venus. She is the only reason Serena Williams ever existed.""

""It all started with my parents they deserve everything. I am so grateful to them. These are happy tears I guess"" Serena said in a video posted by US Open. ""It's been a fun ride"" she said. “It's been the most incredible ride and journey I've ever been on I mean in my life. I'm just so grateful to every single person that's ever said 'Go Serena' in their life. I'm just so grateful. You got me here.""

Williams lost to Australia’s Ajla Tomljanovic in three sets at Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York on Friday a day after she and her sister Venus exited the doubles competition after a first-round loss.

Serena has been an inspiration to many - from children to adults and has been the most successful female tennis players. Both the sisters Serena and Venus took the tennis world by storm when they emerged from the courts of crime-ridden Compton California as teenagers and went on to dominate and change the face of the predominantly white sport.

Throughout her career Serena has been associated with many big brands like Nike Wilson Intel Lincoln Motor Company and many others. Female athletes have long had to fight for what they’re worth from sponsorships or institutional pay.

Serena Williams and Brands

The sports icon has worked with a number of brands beginning with a five-year Puma SE sponsorship at the beginning of her career that was valued at $13 million as per Bloomberg report. A longstanding partnership with Nike Inc. followed in 2003 which has grown to include an in-house incubator for fashion designers. The company has also dedicated the largest building on its Beaverton Oregon campus to her. “The thing about Serena is she's going to transcend sport"" said Tanya Hvizdak the vice president of global women’s sports marketing at Nike. “She's been able to show it's beyond performance. Obviously that's provided her a platform but her engagement in so many different other aspects and showing the dimensions of herself whether it’s as a mother or a champion of diverse designers or other aspects will be her legacy.""

Jeff Kearney global head of sports marketing for Gatorade said Serena has made a permanent impact on marketing budgets everywhere and her overwhelming success convinced the Pepsico Inc. division which first partnered with Williams in 2009 to spend more on female athletes.

“Across brands and the different companies she works with they're investing more on the women’s game"" said Kearney. Another major sports sponsor Anheuser-Busch InBev SA’s Michelob Ultra beer brand has been associated with Williams in the late stages of her career with Super Bowl ads such as one alongside WNBA star Nneka Ogwumike and Women’s World Cup champion Alex Morgan. Ricardo Marques vice president of marketing said Williams played a pivotal role in boosting dollars spent on women in sports.

“Serena was a catalyst"" said Marques. “She gave confidence to brands like us to come forward and put these commitments dollars to make that support more visible.""

Apart from this Delta Air Lines Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have also been sponsors. In 2017 Tech giant Intel partnered with Serena. In 2018 Serena associated with Lincoln which is an American luxury car maker owned by Ford where she endorsed Lincoln’s Navigator SUV. In 2018 Serena Williams has launched her own apparel line called Serena. When she appeared in an inspirational Chase commercial it showed her return to the game following the birth of her daughter. Her other brands also include Gatorade Beats by Dre Audemars Piguet Bumble IBM.

The US Soccer Federation announced only this year that male and female athletes would be compensated equally and pay disparities persist for female golf basketball and tennis players. Nike also changed its pay policies for pregnant athletes after runner Allyson Felix and others alleged that they were mistreated during their pregnancies. In March the company also unveiled a new think-tank initiative which includes Williams and 12 other Nike-sponsored female athletes. According to Celebrity Net Worth Serena William's net worth is an estimated $250 million.

Support of Brands and Beyond

Support of brands also includes standing by Williams and other athletes as they navigate inequities baked into tennis. The Williams sisters were both made to endure racism throughout their careers and Serena is no stranger to calling out double standards and unfair treatment. Her sponsors have followed suit. After the French Open objected to a jumpsuit she wore to the 2018 tournament Nike tweeted its support.

“Support in those moments is key because not only does raise an element of yes that was in the arena of sport and us supporting that athlete but even more so women's rights and opportunities in that aspect"" said Hvizdak. That the jumpsuit supported Williams in both design and functionality — it provided compression to help with blood clots — underscored Nike’s commitment to work with Williams and other female athletes with regard to what they individually need she added.

“You're seeing the money come into play but there needs to be more of it industrywide"" said Nike’s Hvizdak. “We continue to lead in this space and we need to pull people with us. That’s the goal."" And although Williams may soon be bidding the tournament circuit farewell brands aren’t moving on from working with her if she’ll have them. “Her name is always at the top of the list Gatorade’s Kearney said.

“Her name is always at the top of the list"" said Gatorade’s Kearney.

Meanwhile Williams who turns 41 later this month plans to ""evolve"" away from tennis following the US Open campaign. She has also written her first children's book which will be on sale in September end.

She also clarified she will re-direct her curiosity and drive into her investment firm Serena Ventures. She’ll kindle her spiritual life. She’ll evolve as a mom. “I think I’m good at it"" she says of parenthood. “But I want to explore if I can be great at it.""

Speaking about her next i.e. Serena Ventures she told Vogue earlier this month that the investment firm has now funded 16 companies valued at $1 billion or more and that 78 percent of its portfolio are companies started by women or people of color.

Ten seasons later Stoops tied the legendary Paul ""Bear"" Bryant for most head-coaching victories in UK history (60) after his Wildcats took care of the RedHawks 37-13 on Saturday night at Kroger Field.

The 2022 season opener brings with it high expectations for Kentucky. After finishing 10-3 and winning a fourth consecutive bowl game last season both starting quarterback Will Levis and veteran linebacker DeAndre Square said the Wildcats' goal is to reach the Southeastern Conference championship game for the first time in program history.

Chris Rodriguez:How RB's absence – and his presence – impact Kentucky football's opener

""I came back to win"" said Square a super-senior at SEC Media Days in July. ""I really want this SEC championship. A lot of the guys do too. That’s the focus. We have player-led meetings all the time and I always say 'If your mind is not on the SEC championship don’t even come to practice.' That’s the standard.""

UK took the field in Week 1 without two of its captains: senior running back Chris Rodriguez who in July pleaded guilty to operating a motor vehicle under the influence and super-senior linebacker Jordan Wright.

On Monday Stoops said both Rodriguez and Wright would be unavailable for the season opener but did not confirm if they were some of the players he expects to have ""multiple-game suspensions."" The head coach also declined to say whether Rodriguez's absence is related to the DUI arrest or another other issue.

With Rodriguez unavailable Kentucky turned to seniors Kavosiey Smoke and Ramon Jefferson an FCS transfer at tailback. In addition to Jefferson other newcomers to watch included: freshman Dane Key and Virginia Tech transfer Tayvion Robinson at wideout; new starting left tackle David Wohlabaugh Jr. and Ole Miss transfer Keidron Smith at cornerback.

To aid in this issue and improve behind the wheel learning the Barancik Foundation donated two driving simulators to be held by the Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office about a month and a half ago.

The simulators which cost about $237000 for both mimic a host of real-world situations that are not easily replicable including inclement weather and other unexpected driving conditions. They are currently being held in a trailer on the Sheriff’s Office gun range property.

They can mimic the physics and reactions of a wide range of vehicles from patrol cars to bigger vehicles.

“We want our law enforcement officers to have the best training possible” Baranick Foundation CEO Teri Hansen said. “These simulators should be able to provide that to them so that they can protect us in all ways while driving safely.”

The foundation’s motivation also stemmed from the fatal crash involving well-known town philanthropists Charles and Margery Barancik and a Longboat Key police officer.

Barancik Foundation Donation The death of Charles and Margery Barancik caused by a collision with an officer on Longboat Key prompted the idea to provide the additional training. “The board wanted to make sure it did everything it could to help the officers so we didn’t ever have something like that happen again” Baranick Foundation CEO Teri Hansen said. said. Charles 91 died in a crash on Longboat Key on Dec. 18 2019. Margery 83 died at Sarasota Memorial Hospital a day later as a result of her injuries. Sarasota Police concluded that construction equipment on Gulf of Mexico Drive likely blocked the view from the En Provence condominium entrance playing a role in the collision that killed the philanthropists and injured Longboat Key Police Department Officer Jeffrey Vogt. The final report of the crash stated that Baranick was at fault in the crash for violating the right of way. The report also indicates Vogt's patrol vehicle reached a top speed of 84 mph on Gulf of Mexico Drive just seconds before the crash. Vogt was fired days after the final report was made with the town of Longboat Key finding that logs of vehicles driven by Vogt were indicated a total of 21 instances of speeds over 75 mph (30 mph higher than the island’s maximum speed limit of 45 mph) were found. On Nov. 16 2020 responding to a report of a burglar alarm at 6:32 a.m. Vogt’s vehicle hit 86 mph in the vicinity of the 3800 block of Gulf of Mexico Drive. According to the organization’s website $97 million have been awarded to 211 nonprofit partners since the foundation’s founding in 2014. In 2021 the Barancik Foundation agreed to award the town a grant of $274850 over a three-year period toward its effort to gain statewide accreditation. The town plans to apply the funding toward accreditation-related efforts training policy development and technology.

The simulators

The simulators created by L3Harris Technologies an American technology company defense contractor and information technology services provider are able to mimic a wide variety of scenarios and vehicle responses.

For example if the front left tire of the patrol car blows out the simulation will mimic the same pulling and shaking sensations experienced in real life.

Much like simulators used to train airline pilots the wrap-around screens provide the same view deputies have in their patrol cars including mirrors and blind spots. The dashboards can also be altered to look the same as whatever vehicle the officers typically patrol in making the training and scenarios as close to real life as possible.

Master instructors for the simulators are also able to create their own scenarios to mimic crashes that deputies have experienced.

“When that scenario builder is open I can place vehicles wherever I want” deputy Mike Jones said. “I can make vehicles behave a certain way. I can re-create that crash happening with everything from speeds and what actually happened.”

When demonstrating the simulation Jones’ scenario included dense fog where slower driving and quick braking were required to not rear end stopped vehicles a common occurrence during the winter season in the area.

He also pulled up a scenario that included trying to pull over a drunken driver who was uncooperative. Trainees are able to stop and restart scenarios to redo parts that may have tripped them up.

As the scenario progresses the instructor is able to change conditions and push out distractions on the laptop as would happen in real time. Trainees can also communicate with the other simulator through included radios.

Jones is currently the only individual at the Sheriff’s Office trained in the software and scenario creation. Lieutenant Jeff Lane has plans to have at least five additional deputies go through training to become simulator master instructors.

“These will be used to their full extent” Lane said.

The scenarios that are replicated when deputies are trained and the duration of the training are under the jurisdiction of Lane and his fellow training staff.

Some deputies may use the simulators more often than others based on their driving performance and skills that need improvement which can include driving in reverse pivot points and reaction times.

Countywide use

Even though the Sheriff’s Office is in possession of the simulators officers at North Port Venice Longboat Key and the city of Sarasota departments too have access to the training and simulators.

In order to use the machines Lane said the county departments must first sign the interdepartmental agreement that is currently being drafted. The agreement will cover items such as responsibility for any potential damages incurred.

None of the other county departments have completed master instructor training a primary prerequisite needed before using the simulators. In order for a deputy or officer to get behind the wheel of the simulator a master instructor must be present.

“We now have the ability to do this training in a very cost effective environment” Lane said. “We are able to expose our deputies to situations that they maybe haven’t been exposed to yet or things that they are deficient in. We can improve those skills and train on them in a safer environment.”

The simulators can be used prior to their designated training cycle as needed but it is likely the training will not be integrated into the regular schedule until the beginning of 2023. Lane intends to use the simulators as part of the new hire mini boot camps as well.

The need for the simulators comes as the current driving training puts excessive wear and tear on department vehicles costing the department a large amount of money.

“This is a really great tool” Lane said. “We are very fortunate to have it. It’s not just for us; it’s for the entire law enforcement community.”

As far as the other departments in the area it is unclear when they will be able to begin using the simulators. The timeline is largely contingent upon each department signing the agreement and having at least one person complete master instructor training.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite calls from French leaders for its neighbors to “buy European” the F-35 has consistently beat out homegrown candidates in the most recent fighter jet competitions including the Dassault Rafale Saab’s JAS 39 Gripen and the Eurofighter Typhoon developed by Airbus BAE Systems and Leonardo.

This wave of success comes down to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter’s high rate of interoperability with allies and partners particularly in NATO along with its guaranteed upgrade road map analysts told Defense News. But more than anything they noted the jet arrived in Europe with pristine timing as multiple nations were itching to refresh their fleets by the end of the decade.

Belgium in 2018 became the first Foreign Military Sales customer of the F-35 from Europe committing to buying 34 F-35A aircraft. Two years later Poland followed and now plans to procure 32 F-35As.

In 2021 Switzerland and Finland each picked the platform to replace their respective F-18 Hornets with the former committing to 36 aircraft and the latter to 64. Most recently Germany is set to procure 35 F-35A aircraft to replace its nuclear weapons-carrying P-200 Tornado jets and the Czech Republic has pledged to buy 24 F-35As as it retires its Gripens.

Formal procurement processes for Switzerland Finland Germany and the Czech Republic have not yet begun a Lockheed Martin official said in an email to Defense News. Eventually the company expects more than 550 F-35s will be stationed in Europe by 2030 to include U.S. Air Force squadrons based at Royal Air Force Lakenheath in England.

Other European program participants include Denmark Italy the Netherlands Norway and the United Kingdom.

Contracts and pushback

Part of the F-35′s success in Europe comes down to great timing as many European air forces prepare to recapitalize their fourth-generation fleets said Douglas Barrie a senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

“Partly by design and partly by good fortune the F-35 turned up at the right time” he told Defense News.

European airframe manufacturers traditionally had more success off the continent noted Richard Aboulafia managing director of the consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory. “They know their turf and their turf for the most part isn’t Europe” he said.

French company Dassault in particular has recently scored notable victories outside of the continent winning contracts to sell the Rafale to the United Arab Emirates Egypt and Indonesia among others. On the European side France in 2021 signed a contract to provide Croatia with 12 secondhand Rafale jets.

But the main selling point for purchasing a European airframe for non-continental allies and partners — the promise of a long strategic relationship — “just doesn’t apply to NATO Europe” Aboulafia said of the European alliance members.

Key benefits include the F-35′s interoperability. The aircraft is used in NATO missions such as Baltic Air Policing and the U.S. earlier this year deployed several aircraft to the alliance’s eastern borders to support intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance missions following Russia’s February invasion of Ukraine.

As more nations pick the F-35 those countries’ armed services become evermore interoperable across ground crews training and logistics efforts said Dan Darling a senior analyst at Forecast International.

What’s more the F-35 comes with a robust upgrade road map with “a steady stream of product improvements” that ensures the aircraft will remain relevant for decades to come Aboulafia noted.

The reemergence of Russia as an adversary in Europe following its invasion of Ukraine has also prompted allies to prioritize stealth technologies particularly for Germany and Finland he noted.

The recent selections haven’t all been without roadblocks. A Swiss coalition of socialists and Green Party members launched an effort dubbed “Stop F-35″ to swing a referendum on the procurement decision before the offer period expires in March.

This approach was successful in 2014 when the Swiss voted 52% to 48% to block the presumed sale of Saab Gripen aircraft meant to replace Switzerland’s Northrop F-5 aircraft. But it may not work this time.

Despite “Stop F-35″ retrieving 100000 signatures to launch the referendum campaign the Swiss government announced Aug. 24 that it was “not possible” to schedule the vote before the offer period ends citing the risks of renegotiations with Lockheed and losing its delivery slot to other nations in line. The government urged the procurement to move forward.

The “Stop F-35″ coalition retorted in its own Aug. 24 statement that the government gave an “empty promise” to wait for a referendum before the contract was signed and called the decision “a cowardly dodge.” A spokesperson for the coalition told Defense News in an email that the group is debating its next moves but will “not be giving up.”

On Germany’s side the decision to procure F-35s went against years of plans to buy Boeing-made F-18s and it caused further tension between Berlin and Paris as the two nations have also hit workshare snags in the Franco-German-Spanish effort to build a next-generation fighter.

European ambitions

The F-35′s success in Europe could exert pressure on tandem efforts to develop a sixth-generation fighter jet and associated weapon systems analysts noted. The United Kingdom and Italy have teamed up to develop cutting-edge technologies to feed into the Future Combat Air System program also known by its abbreviation FCAS and its nickname Tempest with Sweden as something of an observer.

Meanwhile France Germany and Spain committed to their own FCAS effort also known by its French abbreviation SCAF for système de combat aérien du futur.

The American-made aircraft’s wins overseas have “focused European minds on what they need to do next time around” said Barrie. French government and industrial leaders in particular have been vocal about the need to “buy European” openly critiquing neighbors’ decision to buy the Joint Strike Fighter.

Last spring Dassault CEO Eric Trappier hinted that Germany was under pressure to buy F-35s even as the country paid lip service to the “buy European” mantra. France’s Dassault and Germany’s Airbus Defence and Space have remained deadlocked for months over the workshare division on SCAF’s keystone project the next-generation fighter.

During a March earnings briefing Trappier placed the responsibility on Berlin. “We will see with our No. 1 partner which is Germany whether the first decision they make [after investing €100 billion (U.S. $99.8 billion) in new defense capabilities] is to sign the FCAS contract or to buy the F-35” he said at the time.

Darling said he doesn’t expect Germany’s relatively small F-35 procurement to ground the entire SCAF program “but it does throw a bit of another wrinkle into the equation.”

Trappier and French President Emmanuel Macron are justified in their urging of Europeans to buy from within their borders so that their industries can remain competitive said Barrie. “The F-35 was always seen by Macron as a problem for Europe … because it is fundamentally a U.S. product at the end of the day” he explained.

However some analysts noted that France tends to play poorly with its neighbors on defense programs — for example when it withdrew from the Eurofighter program in the 1980s in favor of developing its own aircraft which became the Rafale.

Comparing the program structure of a French combat aircraft to the Gripen or Eurofighter Aboulafia said: “I don’t think there’s a single gasket that crosses [France’s] border.”

Next steps

After this spate of selections Europe’s big defense spenders are largely spoken for. Fleet recapitalizations tend to come in waves Barrie noted adding that “sales won’t completely dry out but they probably won’t be at the same rate as they’ve been recently.”

Fleet recapitalization efforts within Spain’s Air Force and Navy could be up for grabs. The Air Force is conducting separate efforts to replace up to 70 EF-18A Hornets and in June the service signed a contract to replace its 20 oldest platforms based in the Canary Islands with 16 Eurofighter Typhoon Tranche 4 aircraft.

But the wider Hornet fleet has no replacement. Spanish Air Force officials told Defense News in November that the choice lay between the Typhoon and the F-35. Those officials acknowledged that if their naval counterparts decide to procure the F-35B to replace the aging Harrier fleet that opens up an opportunity to buy F-35As.

But in an Aug. 26 email to Defense News the Spanish Defence Ministry said an F-35 acquisition is not planned “at this time” emphasizing that Madrid is firmly committed to the trinational FCAS program.

Portugal as an F-16 operator could eventually opt for F-35s. But the government has not expressed much urgency to recapitalize its fleet and could certainly choose a European platform noted Darling.

“I wouldn’t preclude a Rafale or a Eurofighter sale here or there but there are just very few markets left to pick up” he said.

The United Kingdom’s final fleet numbers also remain a wild card. While the program of record per Lockheed Martin is for 138 F-35Bs London has purchased 48 aircraft to date and committed to 26 more this past spring opening up doubts as to whether it will achieve its original goal.

The Czech announcement shows there may be more Eastern European fleets to gun for said Aboulafia. Romania has expressed interest in producing F-35s after 2030 according to a Euractiv report.

Meanwhile Greece in June filed an official letter of request to procure 20 F-35As by 2028 and conversations are ongoing between country officials and Lockheed Martin a company spokesperson said. However Athens also ordered 24 Rafales from the French acquiring 18 aircraft in early 2021 and committing to six more in March 2022.

For its part Greece has struggled to replace its aging fighter fleet for fiscal reasons but eventually the nation will gain the more financial ability to place bigger orders Aboulafia noted.

Still he added the question remains: “Will they be for Rafales or will they be for the F-35?”

F-35 Sustainment Costs Have Fallen By 50% & Another 35% In Pipeline – Lockheed Martin,"In December 2021 the US Air Force (USAF) Chief General CQ Brown expressed grave concern about the high operational costs of its F-35 Lightning II. Less than a year later manufacturer Lockheed Martin has revealed that the costs have come down by half in the last seven years.

Lockheed Martin has already delivered more than 825 F-35s to the armed forces of 15 different countries and the defense contractor anticipates the figure to nearly double over the next five years.

However one lingering issue with this decades-old program has been its sustainment.

Earlier General Brown had stated that if the cost of maintaining the F-35 is not reduced the Air Force will either have to fly them less frequently saving them just for “high-end missions” or purchase fewer. The costs however have seen a downward trend in the last seven years.

The F-35 program officials recently revealed that the cost per flying hour for the F-35 across all users has decreased by 50% in the past seven years and should decrease by another 35% in the next five years.

They also stated that performance-based logistics is currently in the works to reduce operational costs further.

According to a Government Accountability Office report it cost the Air Force in 2020 about $7.8 million to fly one of its F-35As nearly double the service’s $4.1 million goal.

The cost of operating one of the Navy’s F-35Cs the aircraft carrier variant was $9.9 million exceeding the $7.5 million target. That year the price was $9.1 million for a single Marine Corps F-35B the short-takeoff-and-vertical-landing variant.

In fiscal 2021 the F-35’s all-inclusive cost per tail per year was $4.1 million for the Air Force’s F-35 A model $6.8 million for the F-35B short takeoff vertical landing variant and $7.5 million for the F-35C model with carrier capability Air Force Magazine reported.

This is noteworthy as the NGAD will already cost the service hundreds of billions of dollars.

Audrey Brady vice president of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 sustainment division said that the cost savings—which only pertain to “the things that we at Lockheed control” – result from various factors. She was speaking to reporters at the company’s Arlington Virginia office.

Audrey explained that some cost savings are related to Lockheed Martin’s “at its own risk” involvement in long-term contracts with suppliers of parts and materials to obtain reasonable volumes and lower prices. Some involve reducing the “waiting time” for a repair by at least eight hours while others involve process or material advancements reduced component costs quicker part repairs and shorter cure periods for low-observable materials.

End To The F-35 Woes Logistical Contract Soon!

Lawmakers government auditors and watchdog organizations have criticized the F-35 program for its high sustainment costs and operational challenges.

The GAO report from July 2021 cautioned that the annual cost overruns for the entire military could reach $6 billion by 2036 if the F-35 program does not contain costs as more fighters take off.

The report lamented that the difference between what the services anticipated paying and what they are spending on F-35 operations was significant and rising. This had been an overriding concern as the F-35s have essentially been listed as the cornerstone of the USAF and iterated more recently in its 4+1 plan.

In a streamed interview with the American Enterprise Institute on August 29 Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Brown stated that operating costs for the F-35 are “something we are concerned about” and that the initial estimates made early in the two-decade-old program had been “probably a bit optimistic.”

However amid mounting criticism Lockheed Martin has managed to reduce costs primarily by riding on the economies of scale said Lockheed’s vice president.

The US Department of Defense (DoD) agreed with Lockheed Martin Corp on July 18 to build about 375 F-35 fighter jets over three years. The agreement comes amid expectations that the price of the most common aircraft variant the F-35A would increase due to inflation and slower production.

The F-35A was $221 million per unit when it entered final series production in 2007. Since then as more nations joined the program manufacturing volumes and technological advancements have helped to drive down the cost of the stealthy fifth-generation fighter to $79 million per aircraft as earlier noted by EurAsian Times.

The plan is to reduce the sustainment costs by 37% over the next five-year period. To that end a logistics contract with the Pentagon is currently in the works.

Since 2019 Lockheed Martin has regularly suggested a performance-based logistics contract for the F-35 claiming that it will save costs for the government enable quicker repairs and lead to better spare component availability.

The Pentagon has shown optimism while politicians have voiced caution. The 2022 National Defense Authorization Act limited the department’s ability to enter into a performance-based logistics contract for the F-35 necessitating that the Pentagon first demonstrate that the deal would result in either lower costs or better performance than the existing contract which covers 2021–2023.

Officials from Lockheed stated that the corporation is still interested in working with the US Defense Department on a performance-based logistics contract and that they hope to have a limited agreement in place by the start of 2024.

Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for a performance-based logistics contract covering only supply support and demand reduction as well as a companion contract for other components like additional support and services now covered by the annual sustainment contracts were sent to Lockheed Martin in November.

That performance-based logistics contract would last from 2024-2028. It could be in place if all goes well by January 1 2024.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYWxtYmVhY2hkYWlseW5ld3MuY29tL3N0b3J5L29waW5pb24vMjAyMi8wOS8wNC9sZXR0ZXItZXhwYW5kLWhpZ2gtdGVjaG5vbG9neS1tYXJpdGltZS1zZWN0b3ItcG9ydC1wYWxtLWJlYWNoLzc5NzM2NTYwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Letter: Expansion of the high technology maritime sector should happen at the Port of Palm Beach,"W. Bradford Gary

Special to the Daily News

We should commend the Port of Palm Beach Commission for the successful establishment and expansion of the super yacht facility Berth One.

Everything I have seen in the maritime world suggests that super yachts will dominate the “new build'' category of ship construction for many years to come. The port is well equipped to handle the new marine business while other docking facilities lower in the Lake Worth Lagoon may have difficulty with large vessel length depth and channel restrictions.

The port also has exciting opportunities for clean environment business activity. A large cruise ship operation has been retrofitted with a business model designed by Jimmy Buffett. The expanded cruise facility has the potential to provide additional revenues but also attract cruise tourists to the other attractions of the county. Unfortunately for many years the port was utilized as a remote staging point and export shipping platform for heavy industrial composites. Today our valuable county waterfront is better suited for tourism and high-technology activity — platforms for new marine technology.

Storage of large commodity and construction items should be located in less-expensive areas outside the near shore area of Lake Worth. Lockheed Martin a leading U.S. maritime warfare defense contractor is a major DoD contractor based on the north side of the port. Lockheed technology is leading the way for new maritime weapons systems. Lockheed tests underwater drones off the Lake Worth Inlet [and] our Gulf Stream location serves as a near shore weapons range. Almost every week test drones are towed out to the Lake Worth Inlet for sea trials.

Lockheedʼs history in Palm Beach is instructive; original work on civilian and government submersibles occurred in the 1950s at Perry Submersibles in Riviera Beach. The U.S. government — through the work of former U.S. Rep. Paul Rogers of Palm Beach — established a large shoreside base in West Palm for the Navyʼs Underwater Weapons Range in the Atlantic tongue in the lower Bahamas chain. U.S. Navy contractor flights to and from the range now depart daily from Palm Beach International Airport. The Bahamas Underwater Range and associated West Palm activity are major employers and bring government science assets to the area.

Because the Lake Worth Inlet has secure all-weather access for ocean-going vessels the port is uniquely qualified for expansion of the high technology maritime sector. No U.S. port facility is similarly situated. We should take further advantage of our superior oceanic location to build a world-class maritime location to include research institutions specialized submersible ship sites and university programs in the ocean sciences.

Many U.S. and foreign jurisdictions establish local tax incentives for new technology employment. Perhaps Palm Beach County should review the desirability of establishing a new county “wage credit“ that would provide a partial credit for specifically qualified new marine research facilities.

Some years ago Palm Beach established numerous local incentives for a biotechnology cluster. I believe that marine technology has better prospects for our county employment growth compared to the pharmaceutical/biotechnology sector.

Our future prospects are clearly better served today if we engage with the world of high maritime technology. Letʼs start to work.

But when HIMARS (an acronym which stands for High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) showed up in Ukraine it changed the face of battle. ""This capability has given the Ukrainians the potential to completely change the momentum and the direction of this war"" said retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe.

He said HIMARS which fires a 200-pound warhead up to 50 miles and hits within 10 feet of its intended target has virtually eliminated Russia's numerical advantage.

""You don't have to have hundreds of artillery rounds to achieve the same effect as one rocket fired from HIMARS"" said Hodges.

CBS News national security correspondent David Martin asked ""Is Ukraine still outgunned?""

""In numbers I'd say yes. But what really matters is effect. And the effect that Ukraine is achieving it seems to me at this point to be superior to what the Russians are able to deliver.""

Since June the U.S. has shipped Ukraine 16 HIMARS launchers and thousands of rockets which defense officials say the Ukrainians have used to attack more than 350 Russian command posts ammo dumps supply depots and other high-value targets far back from the front lines.

Hodges said ""The HIMARS and other long-range capabilities have given the Ukrainians the ability to reach out and hit targets that the Russians would have thought were safe.""

Martin asked ""Why can't they just move all these command posts and ammo dumps further back from the front line and get them out of range?""

""You still gotta get that ammunition to the guns which are closer to the front"" Hodges replied. ""So now you've increased the distance that the trucks have to move carrying very heavy ammunition. And they've lost well over 1000 trucks in this campaign so far. The result is significant reduction in the amount of Russian artillery and rocket fire impacting on Ukrainian forces.""

All that from a weapon made at a Lockheed Martin plant in rural Arkansas – a seemingly minor outpost in America's vast military-industrial complex which is now racing to catch up with the sudden demand for HIMARS.

""Sunday Morning"" accompanied the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer Dr. William LaPlante as he made plans to dramatically increase production.

""We have to plan for at least to double this – the production here probably will be double"" LaPlante said.

Martin asked ""How long can you keep that up?""

""As long as the demand is needed. We can keep production lines open for 30 years.""

The Lockheed Martin plant in Camden Arkansas produces HIMARS (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) and GMLRS (Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems). Lockheed Martin

Lockheed Martin's chief operating officer Frank St. John said the plant is currently turning out about 7500 rockets a year. Martin asked him ""You heard the man from the Pentagon; he said they're probably going to double production. Can you double production?""

""Absolutely"" said St. John. ""We have capacity to produce 10000 rockets a year. That's a rocket every 10 minutes if you do the math on that. We're also doing similar analysis to take that up to 12000 or 14000 rockets a year.""

""How fast can you do this?""

""I would say on the order of 18 to 24 months to make any significant changes in the production quantities.""

The nose cone carries a satellite guidance system which gives the rocket its sniper-like accuracy. But what impresses LaPlante most about HIMARS is not the sophistication of its technology but the simplicity of its use. ""There are just three operators probably 18- to-20-years-old and the system works"" he said. ""And they can use it effectively within a week. That to me is as important as its accuracy. It's reliable and can be done by 18-year-old Ukrainians.""

To see how HIMARS operates in the field Martin went to the U.S. Army training range in Yakima Washington where they use the same tactics taught to the Ukrainians.

At a ""hide site"" the HIMARS crew tries to conceal itself from enemy surveillance. Once it leaves here for its firing position the HIMARS is liable to be spotted and targeted so the clock starts ticking.

The HIMARS launcher has a top speed of 55 miles an hour but off-road in the high desert it's more like 35. Once it's out in the open it has about five-to-seven minutes to find its firing position train its rockets on the target and fire – one rocket every few seconds.

Martin asked the crew chief of one HIMARS Staff Sergeant Cami White ""How'd you guys do?""

""We did well!"" she replied.

""What does that mean 'well'?""

""Whenever we get a 'fire when ready' it's as fast as you can fire it. So with that I think our time was around three minutes.""

""Three minutes from the time you got the mission to the time the rockets took off?""

""Yes sir.""

When the HIMARS fires the rocket exhaust gives away its position so it has to get out of there fast before the enemy can strike back.

""How long do you have to get out?"" Martin asked.

""Oh as quickly as possible"" said White. ""Roughly a minute.""

It's called ""shoot and scoot"" and the Ukrainians are doing it now in their counteroffensive against Russian forces occupying Kherson making the most of the 16 HIMARS provided by the U.S.

""Sixteen just doesn't sound like a lot"" Martin said.

""It's nowhere near what I think Ukraine could use"" Hodges said. ""I mean look at the effect they've achieved with 16. Imagine if they had three or four times that many.""

He was 96.

His death was confirmed by his son Marc Turkel.

In 10 books and 270 blog posts Mr. Turkel (pronounced tur-KELL) explored the idiosyncrasies of lodgings in New York and around the world — from the history of the original hyphen in the name of the Waldorf Astoria in New York to the revelation that the Hotel Monteleone’s Carousel Piano Bar in New Orleans revolves on 2000 steel rollers.

He introduced readers to César Ritz the namesake of hotels a snack cracker and an adjective. He recalled the ubiquitous windup figure of a harried executive that the Sheraton chain featured in a campaign with the slogan “Keyed-Up Executives Unwind at Sheraton.”

Mr. Turkel was more than a hotel maven; he was also a polymath. A civic activist he was president from 1967 to 1978 of the City Club of New York an organization whose influence over municipal government waned in the final decades of the 20th century.

One impish recent line displayed at the start of each episode of Inventing Anna the Netflix show about Anna Sorokin (also known as Anna Delvey) the fake heiress reads: “This whole story is completely true. Except for the parts that are completely made up.”

It is a trick that is by now almost a cinematic cliche with notable examples including the words that open the apocalyptic 1964 comedy Dr Strangelove. “It is the stated position of the United States Air Force that their safeguards would prevent the occurrence of such events as are depicted in this film” director Stanley Kubrick’s audience is informed.

Yet even a heavily fictionalised improbable story can be judged to have impugned real people. And when some of those improbable events really did take place then litigation is a growing risk.

Last week the former Vanity Fair photo editor portrayed as a key character in Inventing Anna chose to ignore the playful tone of the show’s disclaimer and said she would sue Netflix over her portrayal.

Rachel DeLoache Williams a former associate and financial victim of Anna Sorokin who used social media to con her way into the bank accounts of high-society Americans is just one of the latest combatants on an increasingly crowded legal battlefield. Her defamation lawsuit argues that she appears “a greedy snobbish disloyal dishonest cowardly manipulative and opportunistic person”.

Netflix has not commented on the case but her claim is one of several recent attempts to get compensation from the streaming giant after an allegedly unfair portrayal in a drama. The former Soviet chess grandmaster Nona Gaprindashvili has taken action against the company for implying in its hit drama Queen’s Gambit that her character had not regularly competed against men. And Linda Fairstein a former Manhattan prosecutor was upset when she felt she looked racist in When They See Us a drama about a 1989 miscarriage of justice. The docu-drama Operation Varsity Blues about corruption in the college admissions system in America also prompted a suit from parents who believed the show destroyed their reputations.

Behind this run of legal spats is the new appetite for drama based on real-life stories. They now fuel such a steady diet of box-set series that viewers hardly notice how much they are consuming whether they are lapping up retellings of old scandals or retracing the steps of a notorious criminal.

Contemporary sensation is at a particular premium. Before Netflix swooped on the Sorokin plot Williams had been poised to develop a drama based on her book My Friend Anna with HBO. She did not cooperate with Netflix who had signed a £240000 rights deal with Sorokin and so she lost her chance to influence its version.

Those in the know frequently point out how naive it is to try to punish the makers of a drama or film that has given a hurtful impression. In America cases rarely make it through the first stage of proceedings yet more claimants are now chancing their arm. The legal area like music plagiarism is thought to be in flux and worth a shot.

As Christopher Gabbitas of UK firm Keystone Law sees it on both sides of the Atlantic the common misconception is that a life story belongs to the individual. “There is still this idea we have some form of ownership and so are the people who can grant rights. But there is no legal basis for that in English law; no trademark copyright or intellectual property protection. And in most territories nothing prevents the producer of a drama doing what they want.”

The situation is however getting more complex. So far there have been no big legal wins but the fast pace of translation from real life to screen is perilous. As the London-based media lawyer Dominic Crossley of Payne Hicks Beach points out the passage of time is helpful because it allows an accepted version of an incident to emerge. Controversial stories make for good drama and storytelling can mean taking sides. And it is no good adopting a whimsical tone to tell of a supposed treachery in the hope it will aid the defence of a defamation claim. “Producers of ‘true life dramas’ cannot have their cake and eat it” argues Crossley. “If they want their show to be deemed to be ‘true’ they cannot then evade all legal responsibility if they get it wrong and defame one of the characters or disregard their privacy. Newspaper journalists and authors tend to have rigorous editorial processes before committing their account of recent events to paper and generally they approach the subjects for their response. It seems to me that the producers of these often highly sensationalist dramas need to apply the same disciplines. The damage caused to an individual portrayed by an actor in one of these big-budget dramas may well be at least as acute as that caused by a written account.”

Another new factor is the shift in the role of a streamer such as Netflix. It now has the status of a production studio rather than that of a place to watch the work of others. Winning lots of Emmy awards may be nice but with it comes added artistic accountability.

In Britain entertainment continues to have a wide legal scope even with true stories. Gabbitas sees our adherence to the Human Rights Act of 1998 as a key protection. “Until such time as we pull out our courts will still make judgments on the balance between article 8 which states that people have a right to a private family life and personal correspondence and the opposing provisions of article 10 which lays out the right to self expression for anyone including those portraying other people.”

In Britain the human rights cover for creative freedom is comfortably backed up by the aged torts of common law and precedent. In contrast in the US the mere identification of a character by name brings the threat of invasion of privacy litigation.

Celebrities though can have a harder time preserving their privacy. In 1994 Hollywood star Elizabeth Taylor attempted to stop an NBC drama from telling her life story as depicted in an unauthorised biography. But the courts found against her because it was deemed that she had already forfeited her privacy by frequently appearing in public and in magazine features. It established what might be called the “Hello!” principle of “fair game”. And of course the existing image of a claimant also matters. If you have a criminal conviction then you probably don’t have a leg to stand on. Step back from the phone Joe Exotic.

Experienced producers tend to make early contact with those they aim to portray. Winning them over to the project means they also gain insights and greater access to the facts. Investors are also more likely to be attracted. Backers are reassured if “errors and omissions” insurance cover is already in place and securing that often rests on proof that due diligence has been carried out on any likely defamation risks.

“It’s always better to get the facts from the horses’ mouths and it helps with the publicity for a project too” says Gabbitas adding that positive contact with protagonists can prevent a painful bout of “injunctive relief” something no TV show wants to suffer from. This is a quick prohibitive legal move that stops a creative project in its tracks.

Even the death of a subject it turns out does not offer total safety. In a few places although not in Britain surviving descendants may be able to claim they have been defamed. Truth ultimately is the best defence for a bold producer. “What’s important to understand is that the film or TV producer has to produce the evidence” said Gabbitas. “The onus is on them.”

Once the checks have been done nervous producers might bear in mind that even those who are portrayed as flawed on screen are sometimes delighted just to be featured. The hotel concierge Neffatari Davis who befriended Sorokin while she built up a mighty room-service bill seems pleased with the Netflix show and has posted online fondly about her old convicted pal Anna.

“You’re the Thelma to my Louise. And even though I don’t agree with all the things you’ve done in this lifetime … I could never be shady and forget about you” Davis recently posted."

Not so in the UK Japan Germany France and most other rich countries around the world where parents – including fathers in some cases – can take significant time off after a child is born with part of their compensation being covered by the government.

The US has no such benefit. Federal law mandates employers to allow their employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act and it seems very unlikely that a national paid leave requirement will become legislation anytime soon. However some states have picked up the ball.

According to the National Conference of State Legislatures 11 states – California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Massachusetts Maryland New Jersey New York Oregon Rhode Island and Washington – and the District of Columbia currently offer paid family and medical leave all of which are funded through employee-paid payroll taxes and some of which are also partially funded by employer-paid payroll taxes.

With the lack of government assistance have US employers stepped up to provide this important benefit? Unfortunately the opposite is happening.

A recent study of approximately 3000 employers by the Society for Human Resource Management reported in the Wall Street Journal found that the share of employers offering paid maternity leave beyond what is required by law dropped to 35% this past year which is down from 53% in 2020. The share of employers giving paid paternity time off fell to 27% in 2022 from 44% in 2020. Rising costs and a desire to return to pre-pandemic norms are some of the reasons cited for this trend.

For business owners parental leave is costly and disruptive. Some companies – like HPE Etsy Dropbox Netflix and Lululemon Athletica – offer six months or more of paid leave for both primary and secondary caregivers. But these are large companies. It’s more difficult for many small businesses to lose a key employee for an extended period of time.

For employees however parental leave can be a very important benefit because the time off is potentially needed to adjust to a significant personal change. Having to shoulder the responsibilities of a job during those first few weeks or months after birth can be very difficult.

This is a tricky issue particularly for a small business with fewer resources than a larger organization. And there are tricky questions to answer. Is it biased to offer paid leave to new parents? What about those who don’t or can’t have children? Is it fair to tell a new mother or father that you need them to be responsible for at least some of their work duties from home now that we know remote working is valid option? How long can a small business owner keep a job open without operations being significantly affected? How long can we afford to cut a paycheck every week when no work is being done?

Tricky but not insurmountable. Based on what I’ve seen from my smartest clients here are a few thoughts that may help answer these questions.

First if a small business has fewer than 50 employees it doesn’t need to comply with the Family and Medical Leave Act. But thanks to the Section 45S employer credit – a relatively little-known tax rule that was extended through 2025 – if a business allows an employee to take the time off and continues to pay at least half of their wages the company can receive a tax credit for up to 25% of the wages paid. So that could help with the cost.

Speaking of tax benefits an employer can deduct up to $5000 a year in contributions to an employee’s flexible spending account (FSA) which can be used for childcare and is not taxable to the employee. There are limitations to this deduction and time should be invested – and professionals consulted – for both the business owner and employee to better understand how the personal childcare tax credit works and how it can potentially be used in addition to the FSA so their employees can maximize those benefits too.

You will also need to make some tough decisions that address some of the concerns over bias and working from home. I believe a business should include parental leave as part of its company’s paid time off plan in order to avoid any claims of bias from other employees who do not or did not have children. But be aware that this is potentially controversial and could have an impact on retaining and recruiting workers.

The good news is that one of the many benefits of being a small employer is that you can be flexible and do not have to adhere to a rigid corporate policy. You can figure out an arrangement that works best for both you and your workers. Use that flexibility to your advantage.

Yes paid time off should be given to a new parent regardless of your company’s size. It’s not only the right thing to do it’s also a necessary benefit to offer in this time of tight labor markets. Done the right way even a small business can manage this.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Authorities found multiple firearms body armor and ammunition inside the couple's home while executing a search warrant on Thursday.

Detectives immediately alerted the Donley County Sheriff's Office in Texas and Texas Department of Public Safety about the couple.

When deputies in Donley County tried to pull over the semi-truck the couple continued to drive for several miles before coming to a stop officials said.

Edward and Elizabeth then exited the vehicle and opened fire on deputies and troopers the sheriff's office said. The Stevensons were killed in the ensuing shootout.

Authorities found drugs inside the couple's residence and the semi-truck they were driving through Texas the sheriff's office said.

Putnam County Sheriff Eddie Farris blamed open border policies that are making it ""much easier for Mexican cartel members and their associates"" to traffic illegal drugs into smaller communities.

Farris said the cocaine seized from the Stevensons would likely have been mixed with fentanyl before being sold to individuals.

(0:55)

Open Extended Reactions

The Detroit Lions are signing quarterback Jared Goff to a four-year $212 million contract extension that includes $170 million guaranteed sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Monday.

The deal makes the 2016 No. 1 pick the highest-paid player in franchise history.

The $53 million average annual salary in Goff's new deal makes him the second-highest-paid quarterback in the NFL behind only the Cincinnati Bengals' Joe Burrow ($55 million).

Jared Goff past two seasons Over the past two seasons Jared Goff ranks top four in the NFL in passing yards passing touchdowns TD-to-interception ratio and first-down rate. NFL RANK Pass yards 9013 2nd Pass TD 59 T-3rd TD/INT 3.1 2nd 1st-down pct. 38% 4th -- ESPN Stats & Information

Detroit has now rewarded three of its star players this offseason with over $444 million in contract extensions to Goff wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and offensive tackle Penei Sewell.

St. Brown received a four-year $120.01 million deal and Sewell signed for $112 million over four years. With those massive deals in place the Lions are aware that the standards in Detroit have been raised.

""We've got a lot of work to do"" Goff told ESPN in April. ""The expectations are high but internally our standards are raising and our expectations are raising and we've got goals and things we want to do. It's not like we're going to show up and start winning again.""

Goff 29 has flourished in three seasons with the Lions since he was acquired in a trade that sent quarterback Matthew Stafford to the Los Angeles Rams.

Last season he threw for 4575 yards with 30 touchdowns and 12 interceptions as he led the Lions to two playoff victories in a single postseason for the first time since 1957 and Detroit collected its first division title in more than three decades. The Lions reached the NFC Championship Game for the first time since 1991.

Over the past two seasons Goff has helped the Lions win 21 games a franchise record for most victories in any two-season span. Their 12 wins in 2023 also tied for the most wins in a season in franchise history which was set in 1991.

In three seasons in Detroit Goff has passed for 12258 yards and 78 touchdowns with just 27 interceptions.

As Goff was preparing to enter the final year of his current contract he repeatedly expressed his interest in remaining in Detroit and kept a businesslike approach while trusting his agent to reach the deal.

""I've been doing it for nine years now and I'm kind of used to it. I obviously appreciate my teammates' support but it's been easy"" Goff told ESPN in April. ""Just focus on what matters and trying to get better and trying to help our team win games advance further than we did last year and hopefully be the last team standing at the end. That's all I'm thinking about.""

Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg reportedly flew to Panama to celebrate his 40th birthday — where the billionaire’s alleged brand-new $300 million superyacht was docked.

Zuckerberg who has been linked to the 387-foot-long vessel called “Launchpad” for months but has never publicly confirmed whether he is the owner traveled to the Central American nation on Monday by private jet according to tracking data viewed by Business Insider.

Launchpad and its smaller companion vessel Wingman were also docked in Panama on the same day the outlet said citing ship-tracking data.

Adding fuel to the rumors Zuckerberg posted a video of himself on what appeared to be a private plane on Instagram. Captioned “Travel mode: on” the video showed Zuckerberg wearing the Meta Quest 3 virtual-reality headset while en route to his destination.

While the exact whereabouts of Zuckerberg and his expensive fleet of travel options are difficult to confirm the coincidences raise the possibility that the billionaire celebrated Tuesday’s milestone birthday aboard the vessel.

Zuckerberg currently ranks as the fourth-richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of $167 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

The Post has reached out to Meta for comment.

In March the Launchpad was spotted at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale Fla. after making its maiden voyage from the Netherlands The Sun reported.

Zuckerberg reportedly spent a cool $300 million as a “birthday present” for himself.

The outlet said the superyacht was originally Russian-commissioned which caused a delay in its arrival to the United States due to economic sanctions.

A Tennessee couple found transporting millions of dollars’ worth of cocaine was killed in Texas on Thursday during a traffic stop shootout with law enforcement authorities said.

Edward and Elizabeth Stevenson were first identified through undercover buys of illegal drugs the Putnam County Sheriff’s Office said Monday.

The undercover work allowed investigators to get a search warrant for the Stevensons' home where detectives uncovered nearly a pound of suspected methamphetamine suspected fentanyl multiple firearms body armor and ammunition on Thursday the sheriff’s office said.

During the search detectives learned that the Stevensons were driving a semi-truck through Texas with illegal drugs and were armed.

""Both Edward and Elizabeth had made previous statements that they would die by 'suicide by cop' if law enforcement attempted to stop them"" the sheriff’s office said.

Detectives immediately alerted the Donley County Sheriff's Office in Texas and Texas Department of Public Safety about the couple.

When deputies in Donley County tried to pull over the semi-truck the couple continued to drive for several miles before coming to a stop officials said.

Edward and Elizabeth then exited the vehicle and opened fire on deputies and troopers the sheriff's office said. The Stevensons were killed in the ensuing shootout.

Authorities searched the couple’s vehicle and found about 64 pounds of suspected cocaine valued at an estimated $3.4 million. The sheriff’s office said the drugs appeared to be en route to Tennessee.

Putnam County Sheriff Eddie Farris blamed open border policies that are making it ""much easier for Mexican cartel members and their associates"" to traffic illegal drugs into smaller communities.

Farris said the cocaine seized from the Stevensons would likely have been mixed with fentanyl before being sold to individuals.

The sheriff thanked community members for calling in anonymous tips about the couple.

The 158-room hotel is the first Courtyard by Marriott resort in the country and only the third in the world the other two being in Bali in Nusa Dua and Seminyak. While the Courtyard by Marriott brand is primarily a business hotel found in city centres and near airports the extension of the brand to a resort is something Marriott is exploring.

“We have seen that there is a market for resorts. It’s not the high-end St Regis kind of customer but there is a huge population in the mid-range segment that wants to have a resort experience but one which is affordable and efficient. So that’s how the Courtyard resort concept came about. In India it’s the first one we are trying. We will use this as a blueprint in other markets to see how we can grow Courtyard resorts in other markets” says Arun Kumar Market Vice President – North India Nepal and Bhutan Marriott International. This is the 24th Courtyard by Marriott in India. The brand is present in 1250 locations in 60 countries across the globe.

Kumar also said that there is a new market developing for properties that are within driving distance of big cities. So while it is good to open resorts in the hills or near beaches there is also a demand for properties on the outskirts of cities.

Courtyard by Marriott Aravali Resort is the first hospitality venture of R.C. Juneja chairman of Mankind Pharma. “This is a passion project. It’s taken four years to construct. We are looking at more hospitality projects” says Juneja.

Kumar says that in India as well as globally Marriott has made a comeback. “We will exceed 2019 levels in Q4 this year. Pan India the market is growing. We have not seen a slowdown in either the number of signings or the business level at this stage. It can of course change” he says. Marriott signed 18 deals in 2021. Kumar says they will cross 200 hotels in the next five years.

Of the 30 global brands 16 Marriott brands are present in India. While all the brands are growing Kumar says most developers want a JW Marriott. “Every developer wants a JW Marriott. They all saw the Juhu property and said this is what I want” he laughs.

However it is important for Kumar to do expectation management of the developers. “For instance if someone in Ludhiana calls me and says we want to open a St Regis in Ludhiana I will be shy to sign a St Regis in Ludhiana. Our team will advise them to open a Fairfield or a Courtyard. See how it goes. The investment and returns will make sense. That is how we manage expectations” he says.

The group is looking at expanding in tier II and tier III towns. “We are looking at expanding into smaller towns. For instance in Amritsar we already have two hotels there and we are opening a Le Meridien there. Punjab as a market is very big for us. Uttaranchal is also growing. We are also in a lot of discussions in Madhya Pradesh” says Kumar.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGRhaWx5bWVkaWEuY29tL2FpLXdlaXdlaXMtd2hpdGUtY2hhbmRlbGllci1kZWJ1dHMtYXQtdGhlLXN0LXJlZ2lzLXZlbmljZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ai Weiwei's White Chandelier debuts at The St. Regis Venice,"In an exclusive collaboration with The St. Regis Venice the great artist and activist Ai Weiwei has produced a site-specific artwork: White Chandelier.

A ball of light composed of great glass vines that twist in great arches around each other the artwork unwinds and reformulates the traditional architecture of the Venetian chandelier presenting a unique one-of-a-kind work handmade in collaboration with the master artisans of Berengo Studio in Murano Glass.

Through the chandelier the artist explores the classical imagery of Venetian glass chandeliers and sets out to reinterpret this historical splendour using his own unique visual language. As always Ai Weiwei takes us by surprise on closer inspection the foliage and delicate florals of the chandelier’s baroque exterior give way to a series of unexpected guests items and creatures that cut through the ornate botanical foliage with contemporary ferocity. A pair of handcuffs dangle from a branch crabs scuttle over blossoming flowers and voluptuous leaves an isolated hand raises a finger in protest. To those who know Ai Weiwei’s work these items become akin to clues symbols that are weighted by their varied associations each carrying with them their own stories.

The defiant hand to power leaps out as a clear echo to Ai Weiwei’s famous photographic series “Study of Perspective” produced between 1995 and 2017 where the artist photographed his own hand with a raised middle finger before monuments and sites of power and prestige around the world. The crabs reference the thousands of porcelain river crabs that crowded the 2010 installation titled “He Xie” a homonym for harmony and a phrase used often by the Chinese government that was also a slang term for internet censorship. A glass bird in the form of the iconic twitter icon sits silently within this landscape a reference to the artist’s prolific use of the social media platform. In this way this new chandelier of Ai Weiwei holds within it a complex network of ideas and forms a web of artistic references and connotations that trace the entire oeuvre of the contemporary artist’s career.

“We are delighted to welcome Ai Weiwei’s “White Chandelier” as the protagonist of our magnificent Gran Salone. Our hotel has become a trendsetter serving as home for pieces of acclaimed contemporary artists. That combined with our historic legacy residential luxury and privilege location makes us the best address in Venice” says Patrizia Hofer General Manager of The St. Regis Venice. The hotel is a luxury destination rich in history and tradition inspired by the city’s artistic heritage which marries contemporary innovation by hosting a series of distinguished guests and artists to allow travellers and art lovers visiting Venice to discover the city from a whole new perspective.

The functional artwork is skillfully illuminated thanks to Berengo Studio’s partnership with the creative Italian lighting company Luce5. An exclusive cocktail event at The St. Regis Venice hotel was held on the evening of the 28th of August in the presence of the artist to celebrate the White Chandelier’s debut in the main entrance hall of the historic hotel.

The development is expected to bump up tap-and-pay transactions in South Africa with global payments switch service MasterCard powering up Google Pay payments.

Google Pay enables users to transact with a virtual card number or token which according to Google means that a user’s financial information is kept safe.

Users of the new platform store their cards for Google Pay within Google Wallet a digital wallet that also recently launched in South Africa.

South Africa is considered a major market for contactless payments and according to MasterCard’s New Payments Index 52% of South African consumers have used smartphone and digital tap-and-pay platforms in the past year.

MasterCard stated: “This trend is set to continue with 60% of South African respondents saying they are likely to tap a smartphone to pay in the coming year with comfort and security key to growing adoption.”

Alistair Mokoena South Africa manager for Google said “Access to technology is vital for economic prosperity as millions of people use their mobile devices daily to tap-and-pay at stores pay for public transportation and to utilise a variety of passes. We want to make digital wallets accessible to everyone through fast secure access to their everyday essentials.”

Gabriel Swanepoel Southern Africa manager at MasterCard added: “We are excited to work with Google to deliver a payment experience that is both simple and secure in turn speeding the adoption of digital payments in South Africa. We understand that consumers want to make digital payments when where and how they want.”

Before the sex site’s account was removed from Instagram Pornhub had 13.1 million followers and more than 6200 posts. Reps for Meta Instagram’s parent company did not respond to a request for comment.

More from Variety

The move comes one month after Visa and Mastercard cut off payment privileges of TrafficJunky the advertising arm of Pornhub parent company MindGeek. That followed a federal court ruling in July rejecting Visa’s request to be removed from a case in which MindGeek is being sued for allegedly distributing child pornography and that alleges Visa knowingly facilitated MindGeek’s ability to monetize the illegal content.

On its Instagram account Pornhub shared nonpornographic videos and images. However it had “directly promoted pornography” and featured videos like “Next Career Goal” encouraging people to become pornography performers according to Dawn Hawkins CEO of the National Center on Sexual Exploitation. The NCOSE had been among a group of advocates that has lobbied Instagram to remove Pornhub.

“Instagram is courageously choosing to stop partnering with Pornhub and it is time for all corporate entities to follow its example” Hawkins said.

Pornhub’s Twitter account (3.4 million followers) remains active as does its official YouTube channel (882000 subscribers) where it shares “safe-for-work” video content.

In June MindGeek CEO Feras Antoon and COO David Tassillo resigned. The Montreal Quebec-based company also laid off an unknown number of employees.

The plaintiff in the case against MindGeek that names Visa as a defendent is Serena Fleites who when she was 13 said she was pressured by her then-boyfriend into making a sexually explicit video — which he allegedly uploaded to Pornhub without her knowledge or consent. Fleites is one of more than two dozen individual plaintiffs who last year sued Pornhub and MindGeek alleging exploitation and monetization of child pornography rape videos trafficked content and stolen content.

In a previous statement MindGeek said it has “zero tolerance for the posting of illegal content on its platforms and has instituted the most comprehensive safeguards in user-generated platform history… Any insinuation that MindGeek does not take the elimination of illegal material seriously is categorically false.”

The company says it has banned uploads from anyone who has not submitted government-issued ID that passes third-party verification eliminated the ability to download free content integrated several content moderation tools and instituted digital fingerprinting of all videos found to be in violation of its policies forbidding non-consensual content and child sexual abuse material (CSAM) to help prevent removed videos being reposted. MindGeek also says it has expanded its moderation workforce and processes and partnered with dozens of nonprofit organizations around the world.

Prior to its removal the Canadian-owned pornographic video-streaming website had more than 13 million followers on Instagram and had shared more than 6200 posts.

It’s unclear when exactly the Meta-owned social media giant took down the popular adult entertainment site but on Friday afternoon the founder and CEO of the nonprofit Justice Defense Fund Laila Mickelwait tweeted that the account “was just taken down.”

“Instagram has made the right decision by cutting ties with Pornhub and now joins Visa Mastercard Discover PayPal Grant Thornton Heinz Unilever Roku and many other companies in rejecting to do business with Pornhub a site infamous for monetizing the sex trafficking and criminal sexual abuse of countless victims including children” Mickelwait told the Daily News in an email Saturday.

“It is worth remembering that it’s illegal in the United States according to the Trafficking Victim’s Protection Act to knowingly benefit from a sex trafficking venture” she added urging other companies to do the same. “Now it’s finally time for Google search Amazon Web Services Google Cloud Microsoft Azure and Reflected Networks to follow suit.”

Instagram’s parent company Meta didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The National Center on Sexual Exploitation a nonprofit that focuses on “exposing the links between all forms of sexual abuse and exploitation” applauded Instagram’s move saying that the decision indicates that the platform “understands the mounting evidence of Pornhub’s criminality.”

“Instagram was right to remove Pornhub from its platform for violating its community standards given the increasing reports of Pornhub hosting child sexual abuse material sex trafficking filmed rape and non-consensual videos and images. Instagram served as a distribution partner with this criminal enterprise helping to push millions to their website including children” the group’s CEO Dawn Hawkins said in a statement Saturday.

“We are grateful that Instagram has heard the voices of sexual abuse survivors who have been personally harmed by Pornhub’s insatiable appetite for profit” Hawkins added.

Pornhub didn’t share pornographic videos or images on Instagram but according to the NCOSE the account “directly promoted pornography and featured videos like ‘Next Career Goal’ encouraging its audience to become a pornography performer.”

“Instagram is courageously choosing to stop partnering with Pornhub and it is time for all corporate entities to follow its example” Hawkins said.

New features roll out nonstop and managing a campaign a year ago is likely different today.

But some outdated Google Ads tactics remain useful when tweaked. Here are four of them.

Quality Score

Google defines Quality Score as “a diagnostic tool to give you a sense of how well your ad quality compares to other advertisers.”

The score measures every keyword on a scale from 1-10. A higher number indicates consistency throughout the search process. For example if a user searches for “oval coffee tables” the ad and subsequent landing page should speak to the same terms. Keywords with higher Quality Scores generally have lower click costs over time.

A problem with Quality Score however is that it emphasizes the click-through rate more than conversion. A keyword could have a poor Quality Score but excellent conversions. Tweaking that keyword could improve the Quality Score and reduce conversions.

Quality Score is not irrelevant but it should not be the deciding factor. For keywords with low Quality Scores that aren’t converting consider:

Adding negative keywords

Inserting the target keyword(s) more frequently in the ads

Updating the landing page to sync with the ad’s message.

A/B Testing

Advertisers once tested ad components by running them against each other in the same ad group. To see which call-to-action landing page or ad copy worked better an advertiser would create two ads which Google would show evenly over time.

That’s no longer the case.

Responsive Search Ads contain all headlines and descriptions and automatically show the best combinations in search results. Advertisers do not know which combinations are converting only the overall metrics. Even with just two ads one will inevitably gain a higher impression share based on the conversion goal. The lack of transparency and unequal ad serving prevents accurate testing.

The answer is Ad Variations which tests a base component of an ad against a trial 50/50. To test landing pages an advertiser instructs Google to replace that entity half the time. Advertisers cannot see metrics for each combination but they can see whether the base or trial ad performed better.

In the era of automation Ad Variations are the most effective way to test components.

Match Type Ad Groups

Creating ad groups by match type was common before match type variants and the phase-out of modified broad matches.

For example “oval coffee table” themed keywords would have required two ad groups with the same keywords. One contained only exact match keywords while the other had phrase match. And importantly all keywords in the exact match group would be negatives in the group with phrase match allowing the advertiser to control which ads appear. Exact matches would show one set of ads a phrase match the other.

Setting the campaign to manual bidding allows advertisers to control the cost (and the copy) for each variation such as $2 on an exact match keyword and $1.50 on a phrase match.

Manual Bidding

Manual bidding allows for bid adjustments such as device and location but smart bidding automatically adjusts for these items and more. The advanced machine learning that smart bidding provides is far superior to manual bidding. For example smart bidding considers users’ browsers and operating systems.

However manual bidding is still occasionally helpful. For example bidding above a certain amount on a set of keywords could be unprofitable for an advertiser. Manual bidding would set the max cost per click trading the advantages of smart bidding for cost control.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5uZXdzLmNuLzIwMjIwOTA0LzExOTRjM2UzZjEwNDQ2MWQ5NmI2MTUxYTJiMzhhN2Y4L2MuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In pics: group A matches of FIBA Americup 2022,"Marcelinho Huertas (R) of Brazil competes during a group A match between Brazil and Colombia of the FIBA Americup 2022 in Recife Pernambuco Brazil Sept. 3 2022.

This time in the Super 4 stage of the 2022 Asia Cup. The two teams qualified from Group A with India winning both of their matches and Pakistan beating Hong Kong on Friday by a whooping 155 runs dismissing them for 38.

Aside from their players though Rohit Sharma and Babar Azam would also want to manage the over rate more proactively. Especially after the events that conspired last Sunday at the Dubai International Stadium.

What had happened?

During their Group A opener at the Asia Cup both India and Pakistan were penalised for not finishing their quota of 20 overs in the stipulated International Cricket Council (ICC) time frame owing to a newly introduced clause for T20Is. As a result both were hence forced to field an extra player inside the 30-yard circle for the final three overs of each innings leaving only four fielders stationed at the boundary instead of the usual five after the first six overs of play.

In a match that went on till the very last over of the 2nd innings this fielding restriction played its part in the same. Pakistan’s lower order managed to squeeze 33 runs in the last three overs taking the team score from 114/6 to 147 eventually taking the match deeper as a result of the onslaught in the death overs. India on the other hand also made the most of Pakistan’s forced field restrictions as Jadeja and Pandya managed to score six boundaries including a winning six in those last three overs.

What is the complete rule?

The mentioned clause is an addition to the in-match penalties sanctioned for slow over rate outlined in Article 2.22 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel.

Inspired by its effectiveness in The Hundred the ICC introduced it in January 2022. ”The over rate regulations are captured in clause 13.8 of the playing conditions  which stipulate that a fielding side must be in position to bowl the first ball of the final over of the innings by the scheduled or rescheduled time for the end of the innings (85 minutes).”

“If they are not in such a position one fewer fielder will be permitted outside of the 30-yard circle for the remaining overs of the innings.”

The 85 minutes time limit can be broken down to no team taking more than four minutes and 15 seconds to bowl an over in a T20 match. An over here is marked as begun when the bowling side is in position for the first ball.

Why is it needed?

That the very nature of a T20 contest demands for it to be a quick consumption product for the fans and the broadcasters is not the only reason why the field restrictions penalty as a result of slow over rate has been introduced.

A fielding side may slow down the game and take the advantage away from a batter hitting well by taking their time to plan and shifting the momentum their way hereby avoiding being punished for lack of pre-match planning in in-match fitness demands of the format which most contemporary teams invest in heavily.

Hence the need of a set time limit within which a team is supposed to bowl their share of overs.

Are there any provisions to the law for instances outside of the fielding side’s control?

During the course of Pakistan’s bowling innings pacers Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf required team physio’s attention owing to the cramps they suffered in the August heat of Dubai. This meant that Babar Azam and co. missed on their assigned deadline to bowl the innings inside 85 minutes. However none of the time taken by the players for treatment was taken into account while the application of the aforementioned clause. In fact treatment given by authorized medical personnel on field is just the one of many allowances considered while subjecting a forced field restriction penalty to a team. The time consumed in the replacement of an injured player DRS reviews third umpire referrals and any other scenario which according to the umpires is beyond the control of the fielding side make up for allowances as an exception to the clause.

What if the batters waste time?

The batting team is also penalized if the umpires deem their batter(s) using deliberate time wasting tactics to slow down the game and hinder the bowling side from finishing the innings in the stipulated time limit. In such a case the time lost is deducted from the allowances that are “granted to such batting team in the determination of its over-rate”.

There is however a loop-hole here for the ICC to address. The team wasting time while batting first will be penalised for it in the second innings when they bowl. But there is no explanation about what happens to a team if they waste time while batting second.

How do the players keep track of time during an innings?

The fielding captain and the batters are informed of the scheduled time by which the innings should end by the umpire at the bowler’s end. He/She needs to follow the protocol after every interruption in the game. The umpire is also supposed to inform the above parties including the other on-field umpire of any allowances as and when they occur except those for the sixth to ninth wickets which the teams are supposed to keep track of themselves.

As per the ICC playing conditions the present over rate of the fielding side (+/- overs compared to the minimum rate required) advised by the third umpire every 30 minutes as a minimum is also to be displayed on a scoreboard or replay screen on the ground.

What are the teams doing to avoid the forced field restrictions?

The teams would obviously benefit from having extra spinners in the team but given how quickly a T20 match can turn on its head fielding captains are often seen calling special counsel of experienced players in the team to discuss strategy and field settings. It is here that captains who act quick and precise in adjusting to conditions and those who are stationed closer to the bowler (mid-off or mid-on) can save a lot of the time invested in the above and hence keep the odds in their favor.

Bob Casey narrowly leads Republican challenger Dave McCormick in Pennsylvania’s U.S. Senate race with six months until the election a new Inquirer/New York Times/Siena College poll shows.

Casey leads McCormick 46% to 41% among Pennsylvania registered voters just inside the survey’s margin of error. An additional 13% of voters were undecided. The poll was conducted from April 28 to May 7.

Casey who has represented the state in the Senate since 2007 had a similar lead on McCormick in an April poll from Emerson College.

The race which the nonpartisan Cook Political Report says “leans Democratic” is one of several that could determine which party controls the Senate.

Bob Casey is outperforming Joe Biden

While Casey and McCormick are running closely in the state Casey is also outrunning his party’s presidential nominee President Joe Biden.

Casey outruns President Joe Biden by 2 percentage points when voters are asked about a two-person race between Biden and former President Donald Trump. When third-party presidential candidates including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are included in the mix Casey outruns Biden by a much larger 10 points.

“I don’t really know a lot about Bob Casey but I haven’t heard anything bad about Bob Casey” said Charles Kestener 41 a registered independent from Allentown who plans to vote for Casey but not Biden.

Kestener a truck driver criticized Biden’s handling of the economy and the military withdrawal from Afghanistan. He said he would support Green Party candidate Jill Stein in the presidential race over either major party candidate.

Casey leads McCormick with women and voters who identify as independents as well as young voters and non-white voters two groups that have drifted away from Biden in the state.

“People know the Casey family” said Eric Stern former deputy campaign manager for Sen. John Fetterman. “They know Sen. Casey extremely well and even if their feelings about national Democrats gets colder … They don’t necessarily hold the senator responsible for their feelings on the economy or national issues or inflation.”

Still Stern said he expects the gap to shrink between Casey and Biden two longtime political allies. “There just aren’t enough swing voters anymore. Even if Casey runs the best campaign in the world he’s not gonna outpace Biden by 10 points.”

Trump outruns McCormick in a head-to-head presidential matchup and pulls in similar support when voters are asked about third-party candidates.

GOP political consultant Vince Galko who worked on both of former Sen. Pat Toomey’s reelection campaigns said if McCormick can outrun Trump in more suburban areas where he currently trails Casey by a large margin that could pay dividends.

“He can go after independents and swing voters in the suburbs that Trump’s not gonna get” Galko said. “He’s got his military background and economic message so it doesn’t even have to be big numbers but a point and a half could be huge in the Philly suburbs.”

Biden and Trump remain unpopular candidates in the state with 55% of registered voters disapproving of Trump and 57% unhappy with Biden.

Casey is polling favorably with 49% of voters compared to Biden who is favorable among 41% of voters. McCormick and Trump are even on favorability with 41% and 42% of voters considering them favorable candidates.

Mike Mikus a Democratic political consultant who has worked on Senate campaigns in the state said 49% favorability is a good sign for Casey.

“Those are really strong numbers in an environment like this for Democrats” Mikus said. “It’s gonna take a lot of money and effort to try to make Bob Casey an unfavorable figure in Pennsylvania That’s one of McCormick’s biggest challenges.”

McCormick remains relatively unknown by 34% of Pennsylvania voters

More Pennsylvanians view McCormick favorably (42%) than unfavorably (24%) but 34% either had not heard of him or had no opinion of him. That’s about 14 points higher than the 20% who did not know how they felt about Casey or said they had not heard of him.

It’s a sign that McCormick is still introducing himself to voters who may not remember him from the bruising 2022 GOP primary two years ago when even Trump was criticizing him.

And while Democrats have for months accused McCormick of being a carpetbagger who primarily lives in Connecticut it’s not clear by McCormick’s favorability numbers that those attacks have resonated.

It’s early in the campaign cycle and both campaigns are eventually expected to pour millions into ads to get their names and messages out in the state.

John Fetterman maintains support

Fetterman a Pennsylvania Democrat is not up for reelection but he’s frequently in the headlines for his boldly casual political style and staunch support for Israel.

The senator isn’t afraid to make waves and voters seem split on how they feel about that. Fetterman’s overall favorability rating was at 48% just 1 percentage point lower than Casey his quieter U.S. Senate counterpart. An additional 41% of registered voters had unfavorable views of Fetterman.

Fetterman a freshman senator is slightly better known than Casey with just 6% of voters saying they haven’t heard of him.

Stern Fetterman’s former campaign manager said that’s no surprise for the heavily covered Democrat:

“John Fetterman takes out the trash and there’s three news articles about it.”

Stock Value: Purchased

Reasoning: The Steelers used their fourth-round draft pick to take a third offensive lineman in Mason McCormick. One could argue the sheer volume indicates how highly they value McCormick relative to other positions of need. They passed on some defensive backs to draft a player who has virtually no shot of playing this year. But perhaps they see him as a potential future starter for the long haul.

Odds are Mason McCormick begins his career as a backup. But he’ll have ample opportunity to dictate or at least influence how things progress from there. The Steelers already tipped their hand in how they drafted him and what they said about him: they’re big fans.

You have to be a big fan of an offensive lineman to draft him in the fourth round after already drafting linemen in the first two rounds. After all the Steelers never did anything like that before in their history. But they seem to believe Mason McCormick could be a starter sooner or later. Perhaps sooner rather than later. General manager Omar Khan seemed to go out of his way to highlight next offseason. Both starting James Daniels and reserve Nate Herbig are pending unrestricted free agents. Could McCormick step into the starting lineup for Daniels by then? They seem open to it.

After all it’s not like they don’t have plenty of tape. He played something like 3400 snaps in college if my memory is correct. He’s older he’s mature he’s humble he’s loyal he’s dedicated. He’s the kind of offensive lineman that you want to have on your team. That’s why they drafted him even though the line room seemed pretty full already.

At the other guard spot is Isaac Seumalo who is on the wrong side of 30. Even if they were to end up re-signing Daniels Seumalo isn’t going to play forever either. But McCormick first has to prove himself on the field before any of this conversation matters. Yeah they liked him but now he has to justify it.

Still Mason McCormick seems like an easy player to root for. And in terms of immediacy he could at least challenge for the top interior reserve role. He played guard generally but is center-capable so he could theoretically make Herbig expendable.

As the season progresses Steelers players’ stocks rise and fall. The nature of the evaluation differs with the time of year with in-season considerations being more often short-term. Considerations in the offseason often have broader implications particularly when players lose their jobs or the team signs someone. This time of year is full of transactions whether minor or major.

A bad game a new contract an injury a promotion—any number of things affect a player’s value. Think of it as a stock on the market based on speculation. You’ll feel better about a player after a good game or worse after a bad one. Some stock updates are minor while others are likely to be quite drastic so bear in mind the degree. I’ll do my best to explain the nature of that in the reasoning section of each column.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvY2toYXZlbi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvc2VuYXRlLWNhbmRpZGF0ZS1kYXZlLW1jY29ybWljay1tYWtlcy1zdG9wLWluLWNsaW50b24tY291bnR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Senate candidate Dave McCormick makes stop in Clinton County,"McELHATTAN — U.S. Senate Candidate Dave McCormick recently visited Restless Oaks to meet with constituents.

At least that’s what the Pittsburgh Steelers’ fourth-round draft pick credits for his own sense of loyalty.

An FCS football player out of the Missouri Valley Football Conference’s South Dakota State Jackrabbits McCormick faced the same challenges as any small-school prospect. No matter how well you dominate your competition you’re always asked who did you beat? Such questions often cap their potential to the middle rounds of the draft.

A lot of times NFL-worthy prospects from small schools must answer those questions in Bowl games and practices. Arguably fewer small-school players make it this far because those who have that talent enter the transfer portal. They end up changing schools where they can raise their profile. McCormick never did despite the opportunity to do so and he explained why.

“Yes I had offers. The temptation was not there” he told reporters on Friday via the team’s website. “South Dakota State gave so much to me and developed me into who I am now. Who am I to leave South Dakota State? They poured so much into me. I feel like they should be able to reap the benefits of what they helped create. Sure some money would be cool or whatever but it’s just ultimately my loyalties lie with the people that are good to me.”

Reporters asked him questions in the same vein after the draft and he gave the same answer. “I feel like in today’s world loyalty is kind of an afterthought” he said at the time via 93.7 The Fan. “South Dakota State did so much for me it was a no-brainer for me to be loyal to them.”

McCormick first arrived at South Dakota State in 2018 redshirting his first season as a zero-star prospect from Sioux Falls. He managed two starts the following season before the COVID-19 pandemic wiped out his redshirt sophomore year. In all he spent six years there logging comfortably over 3000 career snaps on the offensive line.

We’ll see how loyalty influences McCormick’s relationship with the Pittsburgh Steelers moving forward. He has a chance to earn a starting job though not as a rookie. They drafted him after taking linemen in the first two rounds precisely for that reason. If he does crack the starting lineup will he show loyalty to the Steelers when he hits free agency?

That doesn’t mean taking a cheap contract because business is always a part of the equation. But for some more than others so are our core values. McCormick credits his family for the emphasis he puts on loyalty.

“I think that’s just the way I was raised” he said. “People that are good to you you should be great to them and give back to them. That’s just the way it’s always been for me.”

Loyalty. It’s an easy talk to talk but try walking it and most will fall on their face. McCormick stayed loyal to South Dakota State and it served him well to get this far."

Nimi Rama said he was goal-driven when he was young and would ask the restaurant for more hours so he could earn more money to go towards products he needed to buy.

""I would always call into work asking if they needed help because I needed money to buy a cellphone"" he said. ""I was always goal-driven. At first it was a cellphone and then it became a car.""

Rama whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Albania in 1976 said hard work was instilled in him.

""We came to this country to make something of ourselves and that fire was instilled in me to be somebody and to work hard. From my parents down to my mentors everyone was always pushing me and telling me to keep going because the sky’s the limit"" he said.

He explained that he was motivated by items he could purchase when he was younger but then decided his next goal was not material. He wanted to grow in the McDonald’s franchise and have the experience lead him to success. Rama has worked every position at McDonald's he said.

Rama first started in his hometown of Jefferson Wisconsin as a crew member working as a trainer crew chief and shift manager. He said McDonald's has given him opportunities to explore the world and work in different markets.

After mastering every position in his hometown he moved to Chicago where he moved up to salaried assistant manager.

While working in Chicago Rama set a goal of becoming a general manager at the franchise.

""I saw the structure of McDonald's"" he said. ""I saw the benefits and I saw that the sky was the limit. I began to realize that you can go in and become anything.""

Rama said McDonald’s provides different career opportunities which intrigued him.

""There is marketing training operations there are so many different levels to McDonald’s and that fascinated me"" he said.

He would eventually reach his goal of becoming a general manager earning the position at a store in Miami.

Rama managed the restaurant for three years and received the Ronald Award given to the top 1% of owners and operators across the country who have made outstanding contributions to strengthening the franchise's brand image and going above and beyond to serve their customers and communities.

He was promoted to district manager after receiving the award and then moved to Jacksonville Florida.

Following his time in Jacksonville Rama moved to Houston and supervised six stores. He received the call about the Houston opportunity from his mentor who trained him.

""He put ketchup in my veins"" Rama joked of his mentor.

Rama said his mentor was tough and told him the good and the bad.

""He taught me work ethic how to understand business leadership and effective communication"" he said.

He said his desire as a store manager is for people to want to work for him.

""I don't want people to work for me because they have to I want them to work with me because they want to"" he said.

After four years in Houston Rama was recruited to Dallas as the operations manager. He then worked in St. Louis had another stint in Chicago and then moved to Florence South Carolina as the director of operations.

Rama said he is an example to those who believe a job at McDonald's is a dead-end job.

""I am 35 years old and I am the director of operations of a $30 million company and I started off as a crew member. It can be done"" he said.

Her favorite foods are chocolate ice cream and cottage cheese. Her favorite band is Jonas Brothers. Favorite brother? Joe. Nobody else even ranks.

But Cathleen’s absolute all-time favorite thing in the world is fairies. She loves everything fairy – figurines stickers notebooks books T-shirts wings costumes and lights. At the pixie peak of that list are fairy houses.

Fortunately Cathleen 14 has found someone who shares her obsession with the magical miniature worlds: Lorrie Shortridge one of her special-education paraprofessionals at Stillwater Area High School.

The friendship forged over fairies has led to the creation of a fairy wonderland in the front and back yards of Cathleen’s house in Oakdale. The two also designed and built a “fairy table” that uses accessible switches and buttons so people with differing abilities can play fairy-related games. This summer they worked with other fairy-fanatic friends to create a fairy table for the “Magical Fairy Village” event in Oak Park Heights.

“We call ourselves the fairy spirits” Shortridge said. “We spend so many hours just working and imagining and creating things and she just loves it. It’s so good for her physically and emotionally because she’s working with her hands and her mind. She loves her power tools. She’s a girl after my own heart in that regard. She likes to have a project where she can use at least one power tool.”

Cathleen was born with a rare genome variant that results in a seizure disorder that requires constant supervision. She is non-verbal non-ambulatory and requires 24-hour support.

Cathleen makes her likes and dislikes known through sounds and facial expressions. When she’s working with fairies she makes a special noise – “her happy sound” according to her mother – and her whole face lights up.

Fairies have given Cathleen a chance to form meaningful relationships and share her talents with the community said Danielle Costello Cathleen’s mother.

“All anybody wants is to feel included and part of a group or part of a community” Costello said. “It’s great for typical kids to learn how to interact with different kinds of people and also for our kids to learn how to interact with typical people and also be treated as just another student and just another friend. That’s all anybody wants – to be paid attention to.”

Costello credits Shortridge for helping Cathleen find her passion and for helping “the rest of us engage with Cathleen and challenge and interact with her” she said. “She’s found a way to engage both typical and atypical teens in an activity that sparks the imagination.”

SEVERE SEIZURES

Don Costello and Danielle Peterson met through friends in October 2001 when they were both invited to see the band Casablanca Orchestra at Bogart’s in Apple Valley. They were married in July 2003 and moved to Oakdale in 2006. Don Costello is a lead business consultant at Perficient; Danielle Costello is a quality engineer at Medtronic.

Cathleen their only child was born in 2007 at United Hospital in St. Paul. The couple didn’t notice anything different about their daughter until she turned 9 months old.

“She wasn’t progressing as a typical child would” Danielle Costello said. “She wasn’t sitting up or holding toys.”

It wasn’t until 2018 that doctors determined Cathleen then 11 had the rare genome variant CACNA1E. Her seizures are controlled by medication but on five different occasions she’s had to be taken by ambulance to deal with a severe “breakthrough seizure” Danielle Costello said. “If not for medication she would probably have a seizure 20 times a day – each one lasting five or 10 minutes” she said.

Cathleen and Shortridge were paired together for the first time when Cathleen was in kindergarten at Lake Elmo Elementary.

The following year Shortridge who lives in North Hudson Wis. started working for the Costellos as their after-school and summer caregiver. She drives to the Costellos’ house every school day and rides the bus to and from school with Cathleen.

Three years ago Cathleen and Shortridge were taking a walk at the Discovery Center in Oakdale when they found a little fairy display “kind of tucked in with some trees” Shortridge said. “She really liked it so we went and got some fairy things.”

That initial shopping spree at Dollar Tree was a success and Cathleen’s fascination with fairies was born.

“She just started building things for fairies” Shortridge said during a recent tour of Costellos’ front-yard fairy garden. “She started to do things on the ground level but then we built up – with pallets – so they would be accessible for her. It has turned into this: a little magical fairyland.”

The fairy gardens are built on tables made from recycled pallets that allow Cathleen and friends some of whom also use wheelchairs to get right up to the different fairy gardens.

“We would find pallets on the side of the road when we were out driving around or friends would have pallets and drop them off” Shortridge said. “They just kind of come from wherever.”

Their preferred pallet design includes using a big pallet in the middle and two pallets on the side. Cathleen likes to plant flowers in the planter boxes on top of the two side pallets she said.

Every creation – like “Fairy Flying Carpet” and “Fairy Food Shack” – is labeled with wooden Scrabble tiles. The details are extraordinary. There are miniature shutters tiny teacups and pint-sized pinecones. “The shutters are shutter samples from Menards” Danielle Costello said. “I grabbed them and thought ‘Oh those will be great for her fairy house.’”

In the garden there are dozens of fairy figurines and old glass bowls and vases have been turned upside down and glued together to look like mushrooms.

“We just had fun with any recycled things she could find” Shortridge said.

Cathleen and Shortridge regularly eat lunch with the fairies in the fairy garden. “A lot of ice cream is eaten out here” Shortridge said. “She usually likes chocolate and caramel but strawberry has kind of been a big hit this summer.”

ACTIVITY WITH FRIENDS

Cathleen and Shortridge soon started inviting friends over to build fairy creations with them including Anella Rosckes 13 of Stillwater and Camryn Handberg 14 of Cottage Grove. The girls have known each other since they attended the same Early Childhood Family Education class in Stillwater. They were also students together at Lake Elmo Elementary and Oak-Land Middle School in Lake Elmo.

Shortridge started the Friendship Club at Oak-Land so typical and atypical students could get to know each other. The club’s motto is: “On wheels we fly.”

“Even though they have some disabilities they can still do everything they just need a little extra help” said Adele Majeski 14 of Baytown Township who also will be a freshman at Stillwater Area High School this fall. “It’s a group of friends. We just hang out and try to promote understanding and awareness.”

The group’s latest project was building the “Unicorn Rainbow Relay Race” which was displayed at the “Magical Fairy Village” event in July at Autumn Hills Park in Oak Park Heights.

Working on fairy projects has given the students “a pathway to spend time together” Danielle Costello said.

“From what I’ve seen between the kids they’re treated just like other students. They’re just other kids” she said. “Working on the fairy workshop was about ‘What can we build together and how can we show that off and spend time together?’ because I think it does get harder for kids as they get older to know what to do together – let alone if you can’t communicate typically.”

The fairy-construction zone is in the Costellos’ back yard where a fairly recent addition – a large pink-and-green “she shed” with six large windows fairy lights and a crystal chandelier – has been designated “Cathleen’s Fairy Workshop.”

The specifications for the shed – custom-ordered from Strauss Skates in Maplewood – gave the employees pause Costello said.

“They were like ‘What colors do you want?’” she said. “They were laughing because I kept adding windows to it and they said ‘You have enough windows.’ I’m like ‘Well it’s not really a shed.’ … The person delivering it – because they deliver it fully built – said ‘We kept wondering what man ordered this shed? I said ‘It wasn’t a man. It was a girl for her fairies.’”

Last summer the shed was Sheet-rocked and painted and made to look “more fairy-ish” Costello said. A work bench – a recycled door – was built to fit three girls using wheelchairs. The sign above the work bench reads: “Princess Parking Only. All Others Will Be Toad.”

Shortridge spotted the shed’s chandelier across the street from the Costellos’ house one morning last summer. “It was sitting on the corner” she said. “I pulled in that morning and I was like ‘Oh my goodness Cathleen let’s go.’ We went right over there didn’t we Cathleen? and picked it up. We spray-painted it pink and put on sparkles and hung it up.”

Shortridge’s boyfriend Kevin Reilly helped with the wiring and other finishing touches she said.

‘LIKE A FAMILY’

Shortridge works closely with Erin Mathaus another special-education paraprofessional. The two women have worked with Cathleen and Camryn since grade school.

When Cathleen and Camryn graduated to Oak-Land Middle School Stillwater school district officials allowed Shortridge and Mathaus to move with them. The four will move to Stillwater Area High School this week.

“Whenever possible we strive to provide continuity in the student-paraprofessional relationships” said Caitlyn Willis the district’s assistant director of student support services. “We know that our exceptional paraprofessionals are an integral part of our students’ success. I am thankful to work in an organization that understands and prioritizes the value of these relationships and experiences.”

Said Mathaus: “We’ve all been together for so long it’s like a family. It’s great.”

The girls have some classes together but the families also try to schedule some apart. “We don’t want them to be in every class together and have it be ‘Oh here comes the wheelchair brigade’” Costello said. “We try to give them their own identities. It’s fun that they have this (fairy) activity together because they do get along really well but then it’s also nice that they have their own interests.”

Cathleen and Shortridge for example are signed up for a woodworking class this semester. “We’re excited about that” Shortridge said. “We’ll both be learning a lot in there.”

Mathaus of Lake Elmo said everyone benefits from having the girls take part in different classes.

“You see how important it is to be part of something bigger than yourself” she said. “We learn so much from being with these guys all the time. It’s important also for their gen-ed friends to see that they can have fun with them. They can’t do it all by themselves but it just brings awareness and it brings so much happiness too. (The girls) teach us stuff every day. They love school and they just want to be a part of it all.”

The fairy friendships will continue as Cathleen gets older Costello said.

“This is something that she can continue to do and continue to enjoy” she said. “It’s a hobby for her. Sometimes it’s a challenge for us with kids who can’t express hobbies or likes. When you find a like you can then build on that. That’s true for anybody but then I think if somebody is going to be at home longer it’s nice to start building this now so she has something to do as she gets older.”

Don Costello has wondered if everything in their Oakdale yard is going to be co-opted by fairies she said.

“He’s like ‘Is anything not going to be fairy?’” she said. “I’m like ‘Why wouldn’t it be?’”

She said she can’t believe how lucky they are to have found Shortridge.

“I finally found someone who loves Cathleen more than me” she said. “Surround yourself with wonderful people and wonderful things happen.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Following a high rate of adverse experience-related dropouts Merck called it quits Monday on a Phase III trial of its anti-TIGIT antibody vibostolimab and anti-PD-1 therapy Keytruda in skin cancer.

The late-stage study was evaluating vibostolimab as an adjuvant treatment to Keytruda in patients with resected high-risk melanoma. The investigational anti-TIGIT antibody works by restoring antitumor activity by blocking the TIGIT receptor from binding to its ligands to help T lymphocytes destroy tumor cells.

A pre-planned analysis revealed the high rate of dropouts primarily due to immune-mediated adverse events making it “highly unlikely that the trial could achieve a statistically significant improvement” in recurrence-free survival.

Based on the recommendation of an independent data monitoring committee Merck said it is unblinding the study to offer Keytruda alone to patients who had been receiving the combination treatment and sharing the results with the scientific community and regulatory agencies.

Keytruda is currently approved in two skin cancer indications for patients with metastatic or unresectable melanoma and as an adjuvant for certain stages following surgery. Merck continues efforts to move its blockbuster anti-PD-1 therapy up to an earlier line of treatment. The company is pursuing an ongoing Phase III study combining Keytruda with Moderna’s individualized neoantigen therapy V940 in patients with resected high-risk melanoma.

“We continue to ask the tough questions in an effort to fully explore the potential of novel coformulations and combinations that build on the foundation of Keytruda with a goal to improve upon current standards of care and help even more patients with cancer” Marjorie Green head of oncology for Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

The Keytruda-vibostolimab coformulation is in ongoing Phase III trials for lung cancer. Merck pointed out in Monday’s announcement that interim safety reviews have not resulted in any study modifications in these studies.

In December 2023 the company announced the combination treatment failed to meet endpoints in a Phase II study of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients with progressive disease after treatment with immunotherapy and chemotherapy.

Monday Merck & Co Inc (NYSE:MRK) announced the discontinuation of the vibostolimab and pembrolizumab coformulation arm of the Phase 3 KeyVibe-010 trial.

The trial evaluates the investigational coformulation of vibostolimab and Keytruda (pembrolizumab) compared to Keytruda alone as adjuvant treatment for patients with resected high-risk melanoma (Stage IIB-IV).

Data from a pre-planned analysis showed that the primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival (RFS) met the pre-specified futility criteria.

A higher discontinuation rate of all adjuvant therapy by patients was observed in the coformulation arm versus the Keytruda-only arm primarily due to immune-mediated adverse experiences. Thus it is highly unlikely that the trial could achieve a statistically significant improvement in RFS.

Based on the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) Merck is unblinding the study and recommends that patients receiving the vibostolimab and pembrolizumab coformulation be offered the option to be treated with Keytruda monotherapy.

Data analysis from this study is ongoing.

Ongoing Phase 3 studies evaluating the vibostolimab and pembrolizumab coformulation in lung cancer include KeyVibe-003 KeyVibe-006 KeyVibe-007 and KeyVibe-008.

Interim external data monitoring committee safety reviews have not resulted in safety-related study modifications.

Last week Merck’s Phase 3 KEYNOTE-B21 trial of Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment with or without radiotherapy did not meet its primary endpoint of disease-free survival (DFS) for newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients after surgery with curative intent.

The study’s other primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) was not formally tested since DFS did not reach superiority.

(Reuters) -Merck said on Monday it had discontinued an experimental combination treatment testing a new type of immunotherapy in patients with a severe form of skin cancer after side effects led to high discontinuation.

This is the latest setback for the experimental drug vibostolimab and the related promising new class of immunotherapies called anti-TIGIT.

Merck was testing vibostolimab along with Keytruda its top-selling cancer drug in a late-stage study in patients with resected high-risk melanoma.

An analysis showed the trial will not achieve the main goal of statistically significant improvement in recurrence-free survival as more side effects led to several patients discontinuing the combination treatment versus those on Keytruda alone Merck said.

The company will recommend patients receiving the combination treatment be offered the Keytruda monotherapy.

Vibostolimab works by selectively binding itself to TIGIT a receptor on immune cells to activate the immune system against cancer cells.

Merck said it still had an extensive clinical development program evaluating the vibostolimab-Keytruda combination.

The combination treatment had earlier failed to significantly slow disease progression in lung cancer patients in a late-stage study last year.

Data from another trial in March last year had also showed that it was less effective than a generic medicine called docetaxel in some patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

Gilead Sciences Roche and GSK are among half a dozen drugmakers looking to grab a share of the lucrative anti-TIGIT cancer drug market but the field has seen multiple setbacks.

Gilead and its partner Arcus Biosciences in January stopped a late-stage trial involving their anti-TIGIT candidate domvanalimab in a type of lung cancer. Gilead has announced a $320 million investment in its biotech partner as it refocused its anti-TIGIT push.

In August Amazon announced its all-cash deal of $61 per share to acquire iRobot.

According to industry data iRobot's Roomba dominates the smart vacuum market with a 75% market share by revenue in the U.S.

The FTC's antitrust review includes a look at both head-to-head competition and whether the deal would illegally boost Amazon's market share in the connected device and retail markets.

Earlier in August Bloomberg quoted an Amazon spokesperson saying that the company would continue to supply retailers with iRobot products and sell competing devices on Amazon's retail websites.

In the wake of a report by the FTC last year Khan has insisted the agency take a closer look at the acquisitions made by the tech firms.

According to the report companies like Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon used loopholes to avoid antitrust scrutiny on smaller deals.

A Skadden team entered the case on Aug. 15 filing a motion to prevent in-house lawyers for Meta which owns the social media platforms Facebook and Instagram from viewing highly confidential information TikTok produces pursuant to a subpoena in the FTC case. The filing noted that TikTok’s attorneys were negotiating with Meta to narrow the scope of the subpoena.

Meta has identified TikTok as a major competitor as it seeks to fend off the FTC’s allegations.

The TikTok team included Skadden partners Steven Sunshine David Wales and Julia York. Sunshine the head of the firm’s global antitrust and competition group is ranked among the top antitrust lawyers in the country. He has represented Apple in discovery disputes in the U.S. Justice Department’s monopoly case against Google.

The company has a strong portfolio of applications that could become the building blocks of the metaverse’s future.

It’s also worth mentioning a couple of examples of the company’s applications and technology which will be particularly important for the future development of the metaverse. The first of these is Dynamics 365 ‘Connected Spaces’. This application delivers real-time actionable recommendations by utilizing video camera data and AI to assist retail store owners to analyze and improve the shopping experience.

The second is ‘Azure Digital Twins’ which is an Internet of Things (IoT) platform that enables companies to model digital copies of real-world environments and business processes in order to gain insights leading to optimization of operations and costs.

The technology that underlies both of these applications enables the creation of immersive experiences and once integrated into the metaverse could give Microsoft an edge.

Interestingly that is not the only thing Microsoft has going for it in terms of the metaverse’s creation. Indeed the tech giant staked its place in the virtual economy early on. While games could be considered an entry point to the metaverse and its immersive experience Microsoft’s investment in the gaming industry can only give the company a competitive advantage in the development of the metaverse.

Through the acquisition of popular game studios Microsoft has gained access to thriving gamer communities and prominent franchises. Back in 2014 the company bought Minecraft for $2.5 billion and in 2020 Microsoft bought gaming company ZeniMax Media for $7.5 billion.

On the other hand it is hard to tell exactly how much Microsoft has invested in the creation of the metaverse. One of the biggest investment into the metaverse could perhaps be considered to be the historical acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Microsoft acquired the game studio for $68.7 billion pending approval. The deal gives Microsoft access to 390 million monthly users and all of its existing games including such legendary titles as Call Of Duty and World of Warcraft.

How far has Microsoft gone towards creating the metaverse? The company announced that it had begun working on the metaverse back in 2021. At the time of writing Microsoft Mesh is available in a limited free preview in which companies can try out the Mesh app with the HoloLens 2.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZmludGVjaG1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9iYW5raW5nL2hvdy1jYW4tYmFua3MtYmVjb21lLW1ldGF2ZXJzZS1yZWFkedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Virtual fintech: How can banks become Metaverse ready?,"Metaverse is considered the new frontier technology that combines augmented and virtual reality to create an environment that is digitally simulated. Though still in its nascent stage gaming media and the entertainment industries have already made great inroads into the metaverse. Many other industries especially banks and fintechs are now trying to exploit the rapidly evolving technology that is both immersive and synchronous.



Opportunities for fintech and banks in the Metaverse

A recent report by JP Morgan estimated the market and business opportunities for companies in the metaverse at over $1 trillion in yearly revenues while the Zion Market Research study claimed that the metaverse market is expected to grow at 39.5% CAGR to touch $400.5 Billion by 2028. Digital platforms and tech giants are already gearing up for the metaverse which will have an economy worth $13 trillion and five billion users by 2030 according to Citi GPS . Their digital infrastructure is preparing for everything from e-commerce which will enable better online shopping; to brand/retailer partnerships that deliver a powerful marketing strategy.



As transactions move to the metaverse banks must follow

Even so banks and fintechs have the potential to lead as the world has shifted to digital interactions and the adoption of digital fintech solutions due to the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns. The trend is likely to continue in the metaverse where fintechs will drive most financial transactions.



The idea of a metaverse future may seem like another impossible milestone for those already struggling to keep up with the current generation of rising consumer technology demand. Banks must however ensure they are not left behind when the metaverse is where everyone else is going to be.



Banks must see this as an opportunity to become the future platform that powers e-commerce.

Several large banks across the world have already identified this. JP Morgan became the first Wall Street bank to open a virtual lounge in Decentraland which is a 3D virtual world browser-based metaverse platform. South Korea’s biggest financial institutions KB Kookmin Bank is said to be developing the KB metaverse VR Branch Testbed which will enable its customers to access banking services in the metaverse as well as being used for education and training purposes as well.



Retail brokerage giant Fidelity Investments launched Fidelity Stack in Decentraland to attract young investors and Fidelity Metaverse ETF for investors to invest in businesses in the metaverse. Earlier this year HSBC announced its foray into the metaverse with its partnership with The Sandbox to “create innovative brand experiences for new and existing customers”.



This move by so many big players shows that banks and fintechs will have the opportunity to lead in the metaverse. A new platform model for these industries means they could allow retailers to sell consumer goods in the bank’s metaverse such as cars clothes furniture and even houses. It would also allow consumers to access ‘Buy Now Pay Later’ and insurance/ accounting schemes to help them buy what they need and manage their finances.



The metaverse could enable superior customer experiences

There are several short-term and long-term benefits of getting into the metaverse. Banks and fintechs could use the metaverse in the short-term to create immersive experiences for branding and advertising that will help attract new customers or as virtual centres for training and development which will help train personnel on building relationships with customers and resolve real-life banking problems.



Mid-term benefits include using virtual branches to engage better with customers launching virtual trading floors and investment spaces and attracting Gen Z to make investments. As more players enter the metaverse banks and fintechs in the long-term will be able to onboard potential customers offer benefits of crypto wallets as well as integrating all financial businesses into a single metaverse platform.

Differentiation in the Metaverse

So how will banks differentiate themselves in the metaverse? The winners who understand that it is paramount to make management of finances and transactions immersive and comparable to real life on the metaverse will focus on embedded finance and strategic partnerships so that they are selling to both the consumers and businesses. This will however call for a monumental effort that requires not just a transformation of their legacy technology but their entire marketing strategy and business model.

The Weeknd was in the middle of “Can’t Feel My Face” when he lost his voice stopped and then came out onstage to tell the crowd: “I can’t give you the concert I want to give you. I’m going to make sure everyone’s good gets your money back and I’ll do a show real soon for you guys but I wanted to come out and personally apologize and not tweet it or Instagram it. I wanted you guys to know that I can’t give you what I want to give you. I apologize. I’m so sorry.”

The visibly upset superstar then stood on the stage while the crowd cheered before adding “You know how much this kills me. I love you. Thank you so much.”

Trending on Billboard

Shortly after he left stage he followed with a Twitter post writing “My voice went out during the first song and I’m devastated. Felt it go and my heart dropped.” He then promised again to come back with a new date.

Fans filed out of SoFi Stadium in relatively high spirits singing The Weeknd’s 2021 Billboard Hot 100 chart-topper “Save Your Tears” in unison.

The singer’s show the night before received high marks with Billboard reporting “The Weeknd is the singer director creator composer and star of his own movie. And Hollywood hasn’t seen all of him just quite yet” and praising the Ethiopian-Canadian for his full command over the audience through such songs as “Gasoline” “Can’t Feel Me Face” and “Blinding Lights.”

The Los Angeles stops even tied in with Postmates and Monty’s Good Burger for a special treat to celebrate the long-awaited tour. The popular plant-based Los Angeles restaurant offered a one-time-only meal curated by The Weeknd and inspired by his tour. The meal includes a double Impossible burger with chipotle ketchup and pickles on a brioche bun; a side of tater tots with spicy habanero dipping sauce and a limited-edition lemonade with activated charcoal. The $27.99 was available exclusively via the Postmates app starting on Sept. 1 until midnight on Sept. 3 with a portion of the proceeds donated to the XO Humanitarian Fund.

The Weeknd was originally slated to go back on the road in January 2022 after postponing his 2020 tour into 2021 and then postponing again because of the pandemic but the artist then pulled the 2022 arena tour to move the show to stadiums later in the year.

The stadium tour then got off to a rocky start when it started in July. The opening date in his hometown of Toronto on July 8 had to be postponed because of a Rogers wireless network outage. However the 18-date tour had rolled on smoothly until Saturday the last night of the outing. The tour is now expected to move on through Mexico South America Asia Australia New Zealand Europe Africa & Middle East.

Also on The Weeknd’s crowded plate is The Idol a series he is developing co-writing and starring in for HBO.

Bleacher Report‘s Brent Sobleski wrote on Saturday September 3 that the Bills should seriously consider trading the 31-year-old to the New York Giants especially since it seems the front office isn’t willing to meet his contract extension demands.

ALL the latest Bills news straight to your inbox! Join the Heavy on Bills newsletter here!

In the proposed deal the Bills would receive both a fourth-round and a fifth-round pick from the 2023 NFL Draft. Sobleski wrote “Poyer is a first-team All-Pro and wants to be paid like one. The 31-year-old is also heading into the last year of his current contract. In any contract negotiation teams are paying for what a player will do in the future not what he’s already done. Since Poyer is about to enter the 2022 campaign without a new deal the Bills should consider moving the versatile defender.”

After publicly campaigning for a new contract Poyer brought his agent Drew Rosenhaus to training camp but no new deal has come to fruition. Bills general manager Brandon Beane was asked during a press conference on September 1 about the status of Poyer’s extension “No update. That’s probably the best I can say” he said per ESPN’s Alaina Getzenberg.

Sobleski notes that the proposed trade is not a knock on the safety’s talent. “The Bills fielded the league’s No. 1 defense last season and Poyer was a big part of that. He and Micah Hyde are aging veterans though and the transition at safety will start sooner or later. The Bills could move Jaquan Johnson into the lineup and he can provide a physical presence along the backline. Meanwhile the New York Giants could use a veteran leader like Poyer. Xavier McKinney is already the on-field defensive play-caller but he and Poyer could be interchangeable pieces to create significant flexibility for Don Martindale’s defense.”

In March 2020 the Bills signed Poyer to a two-year extension worth up to $19.5 million with $8.5 million guaranteed per Spotrac.com. As it stands Poyer has a $10.7 cap hit for the 2022 NFL season the sixth-highest on the team and is set to make $5.6 million in base salary during the final year of his contract.

While the Giants have even less cap space available than the Bills Sobleski wrote “A few reworked deals coupled with a long-term extension (and low initial cap hit) for Poyer just might do the trick.”

However Poyer who USA Today‘s Doug Farrar ranked as the No. 1 safety in the NFL heading into the 2022 NFL season remains optimistic a new deal will get done.

“Like I said I’m just here — I want to continue to play football and continue to play my best football here in Buffalo for as long as I can for however long that may be” he said on August 29 per The Athletic’s Joe Buscaglia. “But I’m here with the guys right now and ready to attack this season.”

Poyer Would Join a Mass Exodus of Ex-Bills Signing With the Giants

While it’s difficult to imagine Buffalo sending away a core member of their defense before the season starts Sobleski noted that Poyer would have several familiar faces in the Meadowlands if he were to be traded. After former Bills executive Joe Schoen became the Giants’ general manager and former offensive coordinator Brian Daboll was named head coach Buffalo’s former offensive line coach Bobby Johnson followed them to New York as did several players including veteran lineman Jon Feliciano and quarterback Davis Webb.

While Webb was cut and re-signed to the Giants’ practice squad another former Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor is set to be starter Daniel Jones’ backup.

Over the past few weeks the Giants have scooped numerous former Bills players including two cornerbacks Olaijah Griffin and Nick McCloud. Though he was not a recent cut Jack Anderson Buffalo’s seventh-round pick from the 2021 draft also signed with the Giants last week.

Poyer Suffered an Injury During Training Camp But Should Be Ready to Go for Week 1



Poyer suffered an elbow injury during training camp on August 2 that caused him to miss the entirety of the Bills’ preseason.

The veteran spoke out about the setback last week as reported by Spectrum News 1 Buffalo’s Jon Scott. Poyer said that “he’s never experienced pain like he did injuring his elbow in training camp. That includes when he suffered a lacerated kidney. Got so excruciating that he became nauseous while trying to walk back to locker room and had to sit down before taking cart.”

However Poyer is confident that he’ll be able to start Week 1 when the Bills take on the reigning Super Bowl champs at SoFi Stadium on September 8.

“I expect to be out there as long as there’s no setbacks” Poyer said on August 29. “It feels really good right now I’ll continue to work every single day to try to get to 100% for the first game.”

It wasn’t much of a gamble.

Initially bets in the state were limited to $5 and casinos were not open 24/7. The idea behind the 1990 legalization was to boost tourism in old west communities. Instead analysts said Colorado’s casino customers spent a median amount that was far below the national average.

There was zero interest by Las Vegas or Reno casino operators to enter Colorado.

“The three gaming markets lacked quality assets” said JMP Securities gaming analyst Jordan Bender. “These are not the easiest markets to get to especially during the winter with snow and ice on the ground. The casinos were not ‘must go to’ destinations.”

Voters and Colorado casino supporters however didn’t give up.

Ballot questions in 2009 and 2020 increased and subsequently eliminated betting limits while adding gaming options normally found in Nevada casinos. Sports betting legalization in 2021 also helped make Colorado a market that gaming operators could no longer ignore.

Colorado's mountainous rural casino communities where an old west setting mixes with the 21st century and where only a few working gold mines still exist have turned the state into one of the top 15 gaming revenue-producing regions.

Macquarie Securities gaming analyst Chad Beynon said Colorado gaming has transitioned away from being an industry afterthought.

“The changes have been slow. We’ll see if the growth continues” he said.

Expansion from tiny storefront casinos to mid-sized resorts has been taking place over the last few years. In Black Hawk three properties account for more than 1300 hotel rooms roughly 85 percent of the total market. In Cripple Creek a 300-room hotel-casino that is being built by Las Vegas-based Full House Resorts will double the market size when it opens next year.

Las Vegas and Reno gaming companies committed millions of dollars to change the perception of the Colorado casino communities but also use the market as a way to draw new business especially from the population-rich Denver area to Nevada.

“This was an opportunity for us because Black Hawk didn't have a high-end property” Monarch Casinos CEO John Farahi said of his Reno-based company’s 2012 acquisition of the former Riviera Black Hawk. “For us this opened the market to attract more high-end clients.”

At the time of purchase the Riviera casino was 32000 square feet with 700 slot machines 12 table games and a buffet. The casino did not have any hotel rooms.

Ten years and $442 million later Monarch completed a total renovation of the renamed Monarch Casino Resort Spa Black Hawk that saw the casino double in size expand its number of slot machines and table games add a sportsbook and build a hotel tower that includes 516 rooms and suites a rooftop pool and spa and 5000 square feet of meeting space.

“We utilized every square inch of that property” Farahi said of the site that is the first casino encountered by visitors arriving from the Denver region along Highway 119.

Monarch which also operates the Atlantis in Reno does not break out total revenue and cash flow by property in its quarterly earnings. But Farahi said the Black Hawk casino is now the company’s flagship resort.

He said it would be a challenge for another casino operator to copy Monarch’s investment.

“I don't know if there is as much land for somebody to come and do something significant” Farahi said. “With the betting limits lifted we were able to expand the property and bring the high-end market to Black Hawk which is something you couldn’t do before.”

Truist Securities gaming analyst Barry Jonas said in a July research note that Monarch management indicated it was in the “second or third inning” of its strategy to attract big-spending players to Black Hawk. He said Monarch had more than 23 percent of the business in Black Hawk which he expects will increase.

“Market share accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2020 when the first hotel rooms and expanded casino came online” Jonas said. “The property is designed to attract higher-worth gamblers with a Vegas-esque experience.”

A Nevada influence in Black Hawk

In Black Hawk a mountain town 45 minutes west of Denver ownership changes reflect ties to multiple Nevada-based gaming companies.

In 2004 Las Vegas-based Ameristar Casinos bought the bankrupt Mountain High Casino and spent $80 million to renovate the property and change the name to Ameristar Black Hawk. The company spent $235 million to add a 536-room hotel tower in 2009 when gaming limits were first increased.

Ameristar is now owned by Penn Entertainment which operates M Resort in Henderson and two casinos in the northeastern Nevada community of Jackpot.

Prior to acquiring Caesars Entertainment in 2020 Reno-based Eldorado Resorts bought Isle of Capri Casinos in 2017 which included the 300-room Isle Casino Black Hawk. The property was rebranded last month as Horseshoe Casino Black Hawk.

Reno-based Jacobs Entertainment operates two Black Hawk casinos The Lodge and Gilpin Casino. Bally’s Corp. which is acquiring Tropicana Las Vegas took over three Black Hawk casinos formerly owned by Las Vegas-based Affinity Gaming in 2020. A year earlier Las Vegas-based Maverick Gaming bought a small Black Hawk casino and two Central City properties from a Colorado businessman.

The Grand Z Casino Hotel in Central City has been remodeled by a privately held company and Johnny Z’s Casino in Central City has been renamed and rebranded as the Dragon Tiger Casino an Asian-themed property.

Maverick CEO Eric Persson said the branding comes from Dragon Tiger Noodle Co. a business he co-owns with celebrity chef Jet Tila. He hopes to attract Asian business from Greater Denver to Central City.

“Having baccarat added to what we can offer customers opens everyone up to the Asian communities in Colorado” Persson said. “Getting rid of the betting limits and adding the games has expanded the market. You also have to credit Monarch because there weren’t a lot of rooms here. Anytime another place adds capacity it helps everybody.”

Beynon said casino operators used to view their properties as a way to pad customer portfolios with potential players from Denver.

But with the 10-county Denver region having a population of almost 3 million according to the most recent Census the market is too big to ignore. Beynon expects the Black Hawk casinos will market to residents of the wealthier Denver suburbs which weren’t a viable customer base until the operating structure changed.

“The goal is obviously to get those western Denver residents to change their perception of Black Hawk” Beynon said. “With the changes I feel like they could market to those customers in a different way. I think that’s important for Monarch in the way they run their business.”

Las Vegas and Reno casino operators also view Denver as a Nevada feeder market.

At Harry Reid International Airport the Denver International Airport fills the second-biggest number of seats both coming and going. Only Los Angeles International Airport has more. An airport spokesman expects that status will hold through the end of 2022.

At Reno-Tahoe International Airport Denver is the fourth leading destination for Northern Nevada behind Las Vegas Phoenix and Los Angeles.

Stifel Financial gaming analyst Jeffrey Stantial said Black Hawk “is a great market from a fundamentals perspective.” He noted that Denver was ranked as a top economy nationally for multiple years prior to the pandemic.

“Certainly the large-scale Monarch project is disruptive given Ameristar was previously the only high-end product in town” Stantial said. “Monarch’s growth thesis is more predicated on growing the VIP pool and overall market versus market share gains.”

No limits more games

Colorado gaming prospects improved in 2009 when voters elected to increase betting limits to $100 per wager. The casinos were also allowed to add craps and roulette to their lineup.

The game changer came 11 years later when Colorado voters overwhelmingly approved Amendment 77 which removed wagering limits and allowed casinos to begin offering several previously forbidden games such as baccarat keno and the big six wheel.

The market immediately shifted.

Colorado's gaming revenue topped $1.23 billion in 2021 the state’s highest single-year total and the 14th highest of all commercial gaming states according to the American Gaming Association.

Black Hawk and Central City casinos combined for $812 million of the total which made the area the 15th largest commercial gaming market in the U.S. last year finishing $100 million ahead of downtown Las Vegas.

Through June Colorado gaming revenue was $646 million up 15.1 percent for the first six months of 2022.

Sports betting added

In November 2019 Colorado voters narrowly approved Proposition DD which legalized both online sports betting and retail sportsbooks with the tax revenue being directed toward statewide water-related projects and obligations.

Since launching in May 2020 more than $7.6 billion has been wagered on sports through June with operators collecting revenue of $464.9 million. Colorado is practically an online monopoly with more than 98 percent of all wagers placed through mobile apps.

The regulations allow Colorado casinos to have sports betting deals with multiple companies. In June there were 44 online and retail sportsbooks.

“With its very low taxes and license fees and its liberal market access climate Colorado is arguably the most favorable online sports betting operating environment in the U.S.” said Eilers & Krejcik Gaming analyst Chris Krafcik who follows sports betting nationally.

He said Colorado has become “an ideal proving ground” for small sports betting brands with “disruptor-style ambitions” and a launchpad for newer companies. Krafcik also expects the state to see a turnover in sports betting operators.

“We think there is going to be a steady inflow of new supply in the coming years” he said.

Colorado’s structure has allowed smaller Nevada-based sports betting companies to chart a path outside the Silver State.

Maverick Gaming and Monarch Gaming operate their own sports wagering platforms in Colorado. Circa Sports which is owned by downtown Las Vegas casino owner Derek Stevens has an online sports betting agreement with Century Casinos for its Cripple Creek property.

SuperBook which is operated by the Westgate Las Vegas has both retail and online sports betting agreements with Jacobs Entertainment at The Lodge in Black Hawk.

All the major sports betting operators are in Colorado. Caesars Sportsbook is building a retail space inside the Horseshoe Black Hawk. Penn National Gaming brought one of its first Barstool Sports retail sportsbooks to Ameristar Black Hawk.

But the process created some unusual market access agreements.

Strip gaming giant MGM Resorts International which has casinos in eight states but not in Colorado has an online partnership with the Midnight Rose Casino in Cripple Creek one of three small storefront gambling halls operated by Colorado-based Triple Crown Casinos.

Bally’s Corp. attached its BallyBet online sportsbook to one of its Black Hawk casinos but signed online partnership agreements with DraftKings and FanDuel that are tied with its two other properties. A DraftKings sportsbook is inside Bally’s Black Hawk North.

Similar to most other states DraftKings BetMGM and FanDuel dominate the market with a combined 84 percent of the wagers and revenue.

Krafcik said Colorado’s sports betting environment is favorable to the large and small operators including international-based sports betting businesses looking to gain a foothold in the U.S.

“If you want to go head-to-head with one of the big three that's of course going to be very very challenging” Krafcik said. “If you're looking to proof-of-concept your product or showcase your capabilities in a U.S.-regulated environment then Colorado is an economical market in which to do so.”

Cripple Creek seeks a larger piece of the action

Cripple Creek which is located an hour west of Colorado Springs should see a boost in gaming revenue and visitation through the development of a $250 million casino-hotel by Full House and the transformation of an older casino into a Golden Nugget by billionaire Tilman Fertitta.

JMP’s Bender said Cripple Creek has not expanded like Black Hawk because it doesn’t draw business from Denver which has almost four times the population of Colorado Springs.

“This goes back to the market being underserved with a quality asset” Bender said.

Full House which has five casinos in four states acquired Bronco Billy’s Casino in Cripple Creek for $30 million in 2016 and immediately expanded by acquiring the adjacent storefronts along East Bennett Avenue.

The investment set up competition across the street with Century Casinos which combined several storefronts into one casino and Colorado-based Triple Crown Casinos which has three storefront properties – The Brass Ass Midnight Rose and McGill’s.

Full House owns 17 of the 20 storefronts on its side of Bennett Avenue and would have owned the other three except Triple Crown wouldn’t sell the locations.

“They didn’t want us to have a monopoly on the street” said Bronco Billy’s General Manager Baxter Lee who came to Cripple Creek from Full House’s Silver Slipper Casino in Bay St. Louis Mississippi when company CEO Dan Lee (no relation) asked him to make the move.

The main reason for the switch was to help watch over the development of Chamonix Casino Hotel which features a theme resembling Chamonix-Mont Blanc the French alpine resort and site of the first Winter Olympics in 1924.

The property’s planned 300 hotel rooms would more than double Cripple Creek’s current hotel capacity. Chamonix will have an expanded gaming area restaurants meeting and convention space that can accommodate concerts and other entertainment a rooftop pool a spa and a 300-space parking garage.

Baxter Lee pointed toward an empty space at the front entrance where a jewelry store specializing in gold that pays homage to Cripple Creek’s mining legacy will be built. Chamonix is expected to open next year. He noted that many of Bronco Billy’s storefront units are not currently casinos and are being used by companies involved in Chamonix’s construction. One unit has model hotel rooms for Chamonix.

During Full House’s second-quarter earnings call Dan Lee said Cripple Creek’s status as a historic district prohibited the company from building a large high-rise hotel.

“But we get to a significant size by sprawling out” he said explaining that the project took over former parking lots and other vacant land parcels.

“Full House is trying to put together a very nice asset which the market lacks in a much smaller encashment area” Bender said. “From a market perceptive this will drive more people into Cripple Creek benefitting other operators like Century.”

Stantial said it will be incumbent on Full House to increase consumer awareness of Cripple Creek’s transformation into a regional-destination market.

Cripple Creek could soon have another player in the market in Fertitta whose Houston-based company owns Golden Nugget casinos in Las Vegas; Laughlin; Biloxi Mississippi; Lake Charles Louisiana; and Atlantic City.

In April a $43 million deal for the Wildwood Casino and Hotel was announced. Fertitta said the property which is currently the largest casino in Cripple Creek with 528 slot machines and 12 table games and the largest hotel with 100 rooms would be renamed and branded as a Golden Nugget.

“Golden Nugget entering is a small positive” Bender said. “The property itself is pretty small but to have a brand like that come in could draw interest.”

Stantial said Fertitta would not have made the investment if he wasn’t convinced Cripple Creek could support two higher-end properties.

“I see it as a nice vote of confidence. Golden Nugget is a seasoned operator and clearly sees merits to the growth thesis for Cripple Creek” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2xhcy12ZWdhcy1jYXNpbm8tY2xvc2luZy1hbm90aGVyLXdpbGwtdGFrZS1pdHMtcGxhY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las Vegas Casino Closing Another Will Take Its Place,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/las-vegas-casino-closing-another-will-take-its-place on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL2xhcy12ZWdhcy1jYXNpbm8tY2xvc2luZy1hbm90aGVyLXdpbGwtdGFrZS1pdHMtcGxhY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbGFzdHdvcmRvbnNwb3J0cy5jb20vbW90b3JzcG9ydHMvMjAyMi8wOS8wMy9sYXMtdmVnYXMtdXBkYXRlZC1mMS1jaXJjdWl0LWFuZC10aWNrZXQtc2lnbi11cC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las Vegas: Updated F1 Circuit and Ticket Sign-up,"Las Vegas is gearing up to host one of the biggest sports events in the world next year. Here’s all you need to know about the 2023 event.

“The City of Lights” “the City that never sleeps” “the City of Glitz and Glamour” whatever you call it Las Vegas is gearing up to host a massive sporting event next year. Here’s all you need to know about the F1 Grand Prix that will take place under the bright lights of Vegas.

It was announced back in March that Formula 1 will be hitting the streets of Las Vegas next year for the first time since 1982. Returning after a 41-year hiatus Las Vegas will be the third American Grand Prix in the F1 season calendar alongside Austin and Miami.

“This is an incredible moment for Formula 1 that demonstrates the huge appeal and growth of our sport with a third race in the US” said F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali. “Las Vegas is a destination known around the world for its excitement hospitality thrills and of course the famous Strip.There is no better place for Formula One to race than in the global entertainment capital of the world and we cannot wait to be here next year.”

We surprised our drivers with some news earlier this year… Do you think they're excited? 😂#F1 #LasVegasGP @Vegas pic.twitter.com/wkgI5FtP7a — Formula 1 (@F1) March 31 2022

The race is set to take place in November on a Saturday night – yes you read that correctly! – with the circuit sweeping along the famous Las Vegas Strip.

Just like the Miami circuit the Las Vegas Grand Prix will feature a street circuit that will allow drivers to race past some of Sin City’s famous trademarks such as the Venetian Caesars Palace the Bellagio and its iconic fountains.

The Circuit



Apparently the circuit has been designed with overtaking in mind while also expecting it to be one of the fastest circuits on the calendar.

It will be 3.8-miles long from start to finish with top speeds expected to hit around 212 mph. The proposed 50-lap race will have three main straights two DRS zones and 17 corners (three more corners were added to the original layout revealed in March). The track is also going to be 12-15m wide providing plenty of space for drivers to race alongside each other in their fight for position.

Ticket Sign-up

The pre-registration portal went live on Monday allowing fans to sign-up for an exclusive pre-sale event in October for the Las Vegas Grand Prix. Those who are interested should visit f1lasvegasgp.com.

Upon sign-up the fans will be asked to donate $7.77 to the Las Vegas Grand Prix Foundation to help improve the lives of Southern Nevada residents such as providing one million free meals to the local Las Vegas community through the relaunch of Three Square’s hot food rescue program in 2023.

Organizers say that demand for tickets is expected to exceed the more than 100000 official spectator capacity.

“A ticket to the Las Vegas Grand Prix will be the hottest ticket in global sport next year. Taking over the sports and entertainment capital of the world for almost an entire week is going to be a game changer for Formula 1 and has the potential to set the benchmark for all global sports and entertainment events in the future. Fans won’t want to miss it” said Stefano Domenicali.

However the ticket price is expected to be astronomical. Adam Stern of Sports Business Journal reported via Twitter that some packages could cost up to $100000. That’s because MGM Resorts intends to purchase up to $25 million worth of tickets in order to create hotel+event packages for the race next year.

.@MGMResortsIntl is planning to buy $20-25 million worth of @F1LasVegas tickets from @F1 so that it can create hotel+event packages for next year's race per CEO Bill Hornbuckle. 🔳 He said rooms may cost three times their usual rate and packages could retail for up to $100000. pic.twitter.com/azmwRSUSWZ — Adam Stern (@A_S12) August 16 2022

Even though ticket prices have yet to be officially confirmed it won’t be a surprise at all to see steep price points along the circuit. At this year’s Miami Grand Prix ticket prices were extremely high some of which were close to $30000. Shocking? Not really. The cheapest grandstand ticket was around $640 making it the second most expensive seats on the F1 calendar after Monaco. It was also reported that some South Beach hotels cost up to $120000 for full-weekend VIP ticket packages. These ticket prices definitely don’t help average fans who only want to watch their favorite drivers.

Although the race promises to be thrilling you can bet that the first-ever Las Vegas Grand Prix will not be cheap at all. Get ready to splash some serious cash!

This comprehensive document outlines the collective commitment of CLIA members to foster a better future for cruise travel one that transcends mere environmental impact reduction and harnesses the power of travel to support responsible tourism connect people and places and inspire travelers to sail responsibly. This report is a beacon for the cruise industry highlighting the strides being made towards a more sustainable and responsible future.

The Vision of Sustainable Cruise Travel

CLIA’s report emphasizes the cruise industry’s dedication to adopting innovative and sustainable practices. The initiatives explored in the report include scaling up the use of biofuel implementing electric batteries hydrogen fuel cells wind solar and shoreside electricity. Additionally the industry is working closely with destinations and ports to embed sustainability into their operations. One of the key aspects is educating and encouraging cruise travelers to be culturally sensitive and environmentally aware.

Key Initiatives and Technologies

Alternative Fuel and Energy Sources

One of the most significant aspects of the sustainable initiatives is the exploration and scaling up of alternative fuels and energy sources. Biofuels electric batteries hydrogen fuel cells and renewable energy sources like wind and solar are at the forefront of these efforts. Shoreside electricity is another critical component allowing ships to plug into local power grids while docked significantly reducing emissions during port stays.

Wastewater Treatment and Hull Design

Beyond visible sustainability measures such as conservation charity partnerships robust recycling programs and single-use plastic bans CLIA members are investing heavily in fundamental elements like fuel choice wastewater treatment and hull design. Advanced wastewater treatment systems ensure that the water discharged from ships is clean and safe for marine life while innovative hull designs improve fuel efficiency and reduce drag leading to lower emissions.

Case Studies of Sustainable Cruising

MSC Euribia’s Net Zero Voyage

In June 2023 MSC Euribia completed a net zero voyage demonstrating that net zero cruising is not only possible but can be achieved with current technologies. This milestone voyage showcased the use of biofuels and other sustainable practices setting a benchmark for the industry.

Royal Caribbean’s AI-driven Food Management

Royal Caribbean has implemented artificial intelligence to optimize food production preparation and supply. By adjusting in real time based on guest demographics cruise itineraries and weather variations the company significantly reduces food waste and improves operational efficiency.

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings’ Coral Reef Restoration

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings is deeply committed to protecting marine environments. One of their notable projects includes a partnership with the Perry Institute of Marine Science and Nova Southeastern University to improve the coral reef surrounding Great Stirrup Cay in the Bahamas. This project involves establishing nurseries for the endangered Acropura coral demonstrating the company’s commitment to local environmental conservation.

Collaborations and Partnerships

CLIA members are not alone in their quest for sustainability. They are collaborating with various stakeholders including destinations ports and conservation organizations to achieve their sustainability goals. These partnerships are crucial for embedding sustainability into the entire travel ecosystem and ensuring long-term positive impacts.

Join the Movement at IMEX

IMEX one of the largest global events for the meetings incentives conferences and exhibitions (MICE) industry is the perfect platform for showcasing these sustainable initiatives.

Inspiring Responsible Travel

CLIA’s report and the initiatives it highlights are designed to inspire travelers to adopt responsible travel practices. By choosing sustainable cruise options and being mindful of their environmental and cultural impact travelers can contribute to a better future for the planet. Educational campaigns and onboard programs are aimed at raising awareness and encouraging sustainable behaviors among passengers.

Do We Really Save Earth While Cruising?

The question of whether we truly save the Earth while cruising is complex and multifaceted. The cruise industry has historically been criticized for its environmental impact including carbon emissions waste production and potential harm to marine ecosystems. However recent initiatives by industry leaders especially those under the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) show promising strides towards sustainability.

Efforts such as the adoption of biofuels electric batteries hydrogen fuel cells and shoreside electricity significantly reduce the carbon footprint of cruise ships. Advanced wastewater treatment systems and innovative hull designs also play crucial roles in minimizing environmental harm. Furthermore partnerships with conservation organizations and local projects such as coral reef restoration efforts by Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings highlight a commitment to protecting marine environments.

While these measures mark substantial progress the true effectiveness depends on widespread implementation and continuous improvement. Responsible cruising also requires active participation from travelers who can contribute by choosing sustainable cruise options and engaging in environmentally conscious behaviors.

While cruising may not completely eliminate environmental impact the industry’s concerted efforts towards sustainability demonstrate a significant shift towards more responsible and eco-friendly travel. Continuous advancements and collective responsibility are key to truly making a positive difference for our planet.

The journey towards sustainable cruising is ongoing. CLIA and its members are continuously exploring new technologies partnerships and practices to enhance their sustainability efforts. The commitment to a greener future is unwavering and the cruise industry is poised to lead by example in the global tourism sector.

Charting the Future of Sustainable Cruise Travel is more than just a report; it is a roadmap for the cruise industry’s future. The initiatives and case studies highlighted demonstrate the significant strides being made towards sustainability and responsible tourism. By visiting CLIA members at IMEX industry professionals and travelers alike can learn more about these efforts and join the movement towards a more sustainable future.",,,

Microsoft said that the changes are in effect “around the world.” It’s no accident Denzen announced it she just joined Microsoft has the head of the partner program. But the reason for the change is European CSPs had complained to the EU that Microsoft’s software licensing programs were unfair.

If there is one thing Microsoft doesn’t want is another go-around with the EU’s antitrust group. Last May Microsoft president Brad Smith said in a blog post “We will make it easier than ever to license Windows Server for virtual environments and the cloud by relaxing licensing rules that reflected legacy software-licensing practices where licenses are tied to physical hardware.”

The change keeps the EU off its back but it does benefit customers too says Macatee. “Generally speaking it’s beneficial in terms of simplifying the pricing structure around Windows Server products especially for customers with more complex hybrid IT environments” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvd3RvZ2Vlay5jb20vODIyODkwL2hvdy10by11c2UtaW5rLW1pY3Jvc29mdC1vZmZpY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Use the Ink Features in Microsoft Office,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvd3RvZ2Vlay5jb20vODIyODkwL2hvdy10by11c2UtaW5rLW1pY3Jvc29mdC1vZmZpY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsZWVwaW5nY29tcHV0ZXIuY29tL25ld3MvbWljcm9zb2Z0L21pY3Jvc29mdC1lZGdlLTEwNS13b250LXN0YXJ0LWR1ZS10by1vbGQtZ3JvdXAtcG9saWN5LWhvdy10by1maXgv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxlZXBpbmdjb21wdXRlci5jb20vbmV3cy9taWNyb3NvZnQvbWljcm9zb2Z0LWVkZ2UtMTA1LXdvbnQtc3RhcnQtZHVlLXRvLW9sZC1ncm91cC1wb2xpY3ktaG93LXRvLWZpeC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Edge 105 won't start due to old group policy - How to fix,"The new Microsoft Edge 105 is not starting for many Windows users due to a deprecated group policy used to disable reporting of usage and crash-related data to Microsoft.

On Thursday Microsoft Edge 105 was released with numerous enhancements including enhanced security mode improvements and new group policies.

However after upgrading to the new version Windows users began reporting on BleepingComputer Reddit [1 2] and the Microsoft Answers forum that Microsoft Edge would no longer start.

This issue was also confirmed by readers of BornCity and Deskmodder with the latter discovering that the problem was caused by a deprecated MetricsReportingEnabled policy in the Windows registry.

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Edge]

""MetricsReportingEnabled""=dword:00000000

This policy allows Microsoft Edge users to enable or disable the reporting of usage or crash-related data to Microsoft.

However when this policy exists whether it is set to '0' or '1' Microsoft Edge 105 will start immediately suspend and then shut down without showing the browser window as shown below.

Microsoft Edge 105 starting and immediately terminating

Source: BleepingComputer

Microsoft Edge General Manager Sean Lyndersay confirmed that the deprecated policy causes the bug and that it would be fixed in the next Stable version of the browser.

If you find that Microsoft Edge will no longer start you can delete the MetricsReportingEnabled value from the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Edge or the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Edge registry keys.

AskWoody's Susan Bradley told BleepingComputer that many of the people affected by this issue used the ""I don't want telemetry"" setting in an older version of the O&O ShutUp tool which appears to have created this Registry value.

Another privacy tool found by BleepingComputer to create this value is PrivateZilla.

Until the next version of Microsoft Edge is released users can remove the MetricsReportingEnabled to use the app without it affecting anything as the policy has been deprecated since Microsoft Edge 89.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhdGFjZW50ZXJkeW5hbWljcy5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy9taWNyb3NvZnRzLWVkLWRvcmFuLWJlY29tZXMtYS1jaGllZi1vZi1zdGFmZi1hdC1nb29nbGUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft's Ed Doran becomes a chief of staff at Google,"DCD first reported on his departure from the company's research division last month when his next role was not yet known. Doran is best known for co-founding the Cortana project Microsoft's unsuccessful cloud-based virtual assistant.

Ed Doran has left Microsoft to become a chief of staff at Google.

Doran said that while at Microsoft for more than 13 years he cofounded four separate billion-dollar product new projects/businesses lead planning for the original design of Surface & Studio and led development of a new AI incubation portfolio.

""I'm joining an outstanding team at Google today"" Doran said on LinkedIn.

""I could not be more thrilled humbled and excited to meet everyone contribute to our goals and help make the world a better place.""

What sector Doran will be working on was not disclosed. Google has numerous chiefs of staff operating in different fields.

Doran's departure comes as several senior employees leave Microsoft in particular at Microsoft Azure.

In July Microsoft's vice president of Cloud Infrastructure Lease and M&A left to become the president of GLP's global data center business.

The month before Azure's corporate VP and head of global infrastructure Tom Keane left to ""take the next step in my career to build on the world's computer"" after 21 years at Microsoft.

Microsoft’s plan to buy Santa Monica based video game giant Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion could have major effects on the gaming industry transforming the Xbox maker into something like a Netflix for video games by giving it control of many more popular titles.

But to get to the next level Microsoft must first survive a barrage of government inquiries from New Zealand to Brazil and from U.S. regulators emboldened by President Joe Biden to strengthen their enforcement of antitrust laws.

In the United Kingdom regulators on Thursday threatened to escalate their investigation unless both companies come up with proposals within five days to ease competition concerns. More than seven months after Microsoft announced the deal only Saudi Arabia has approved it.

“A growing number of countries are subjecting major global transactions to deeper scrutiny” said William Kovacic a former chairman of the five-member U.S. Federal Trade Commission. “Many of the jurisdictions that are exercising that scrutiny are significant economies and can’t be brushed off.”

Microsoft has faced antitrust scrutiny before mostly notably more than two decades ago when a federal judge ordered its breakup following the company’s anticompetitive actions related to its dominant Windows software. That verdict was overturned on appeal although the court imposed other less drastic penalties on the company.

In recent years however Microsoft has largely escaped the more intense regulatory backlash its Big Tech rivals such as Amazon Google and Facebook’s parent company Meta have endured. But the sheer size of the Activision Blizzard merger has drawn global attention.

The all-cash deal is set to be the largest in the history of the tech industry. It would give Microsoft maker of the Xbox console and gaming system control of popular game franchises such as Call of Duty World of Warcraft and Candy Crush. There’s also a growing sense that past review of Big Tech mergers was too lax — such as when Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.

“Collectively that means that the kinds of concessions you’re going to have to make become more difficult” Kovacic said.

The possibility of Microsoft gaining control of Call of Duty has been particularly worrisome to Sony maker of the PlayStation console that competes with Microsoft’s Xbox. In a letter to Brazilian regulators Sony emphasized Call of Duty as an “essential” game — a blockbuster so popular and ingrained that it would be impossible for a competitor to develop a rival product even if they had the budget to do so.

The U.K. watchdog’s preliminary inquiry raised similar worries. It said Microsoft’s control of popular Activision Blizzard games raised concerns that the deal would hurt rivals in multi-game subscription services and the cloud gaming market.

One solution could be a settlement in which Microsoft agrees to ensure that console-making rivals such as Sony or Nintendo won’t be cut off from popular Activision Blizzard games. Microsoft has already publicly signaled its openness to that concept.

Microsoft’s president Brad Smith has said the company committed to Sony to make Activision games like Call of Duty “available on PlayStation beyond the existing agreement and into the future” — although many are skeptical about how long those promises would last if not set into regulatory consent decrees.

On the other hand Microsoft also has a much better reputation in Washington than it did in 2000. It is “seen as more reasonable and sensible” on issues such as data privacy Kovacic said.

Microsoft has also been working to win over skeptics in the U.S. starting with a labor union that’s been trying to organize Activision Blizzard employees. Democratic lawmakers have also expressed concern about allegations of Activision’s toxic workplace culture for women which led to employee walkouts last year as well as discrimination lawsuits brought by California and federal civil rights enforcers.

In March the Communications Workers of America had issued a call seeking tougher oversight of the deal from the U.S. Department of Justice the FTC and state attorneys general. But a June 30 letter from the union to the FTC said it had switched to supporting the deal after Microsoft agreed “to ensure the workers of Activision Blizzard have a clear path to collective bargaining.”

Gaming represents a growing portion of Microsoft’s business despite the company’s efforts to portray itself and Activision Blizzard as “small players in a highly fragmented publishing space” per a document filed with New Zealand’s Commerce Commission.

In 2021 Microsoft spent $7.5 billion to acquire ZeniMax Media the parent company of video game publisher Bethesda Softworks which is behind popular video games The Elder Scrolls Doom and Fallout. Microsoft’s properties also include the hit game Minecraft after it bought Swedish game studio Mojang for $2.5 billion in 2014.

The Redmond Washington tech giant has said the gaming acquisitions will help beef up its Xbox Game Pass game subscription service and its mobile offerings particularly from Activision Blizzard’s King division which makes Candy Crush.

Dutch game developer Rami Ismail said Microsoft’s subscription-based service has thus far been a positive for smaller game studios trying to get their content to users. But he’s unsure about the long-term impact of the merger.

“Xbox Game Pass as a product has been really good in getting interesting creative games funded that might not have the normal market reach to be successful” Ismail said. “On the flip side as power consolidates there is less of an incentive to do anything like that.”

Microsoft rivals are also consolidating. Sony in July closed on a $3.6 billion deal to buy Bungie Inc. maker of the popular game franchise Destiny and the original developer of Xbox-owned Halo. Take-Two Interactive maker of Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption in May completed a $12.7 billion deal to acquire mobile gaming company Zynga maker of FarmVille and Words With Friends."

Canada has just approved an updated COVID-19 vaccine to target the first highly contagious Omicron variant with doses expected to start rolling out within days. But what exactly can we expect from these new shots in the real world?

The updated Moderna vaccine is a combination of two strains also known as a ""bivalent"" vaccine that targets both the original virus and the Omicron variant BA.1 that emerged late last year and drove the largest wave of infection and hospitalization in the pandemic.

While the new shot doesn't directly target dominant Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 which the U.S. approved an updated shot for this week Pfizer submitted an application for Health Canada approval for its BA.4-5 vaccine Friday and Moderna is expected to soon.

""The evidence we have to date shows that the bivalent vaccine with BA.1 offers good protection against BA.4 and BA.5"" Deputy Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Howard Njoo said during a technical briefing Thursday.

""Certainly as the situation evolves we'll have to look at the evidence and see what happens with real-world effectiveness.""

But what an updated booster can do for you depends on how vulnerable your immune system is whether you're one of the millions of Canadians who've recently been infected with COVID and when you last had a vaccine.

WATCH | Health Canada approves updated vaccine targeting Omicron variant: Vaccine for Omicron variant approved by Health Canada Duration 2:52 Health Canada has approved a new bivalent COVID-19 vaccine from Moderna which targets the Omicron variant. It's the first vaccine of its type in Canada but officials say another batch of booster shots specifically targeting Omicron's BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants could arrive later this fall.

Will updated vaccines stop COVID spread?

Infectious diseases experts virologists epidemiologists and immunologists are hopeful updated vaccines will be more effective at preventing transmission than the original shots — at least initially — but also caution Canadians not to expect them to be a silver bullet.

With limited data on the impact these vaccines will have all eyes will be on the effect they have on slowing rates of infection and transmission and whether they better protect vulnerable groups in the population heading into the fall and winter months.

""We do not know what the impact is because that is not available"" Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam said during a news conference Thursday when asked by CBC News how effective the updated vaccines will be at stopping the spread of the virus.

Tam said she is hopeful that the new bivalent BA.1-targeted vaccine from Moderna boosts protection against infection and transmission — at least through the fall.

Clinical trial data on the BA.1-targeted vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech suggests they provide slightly stronger immune protection against Omicron than the original vaccines but exactly what that translates to in the real world remains to be seen.

""The immune responses to these variant-tuned boosters are modestly encouraging but we are still waiting for definitive clinical evidence"" said Dr. David Naylor who co-chairs the federal government's COVID-19 Immunity Task Force.

""That said even if their marginal advantages are small they could have a meaningfully positive impact if their novelty rekindles public interest in getting boosted.""

A new preprint modelling study  that has not been peer reviewed suggested that updated vaccines may not be much more effective than existing boosters in a population with hybrid immunity from vaccination and infection — especially when it comes to protection against severe illness.

But that could still lead to significant protection at a population level with the preprint also suggesting that for every 1000 people vaccinated with an updated booster an average of eight fewer people would be hospitalized compared with the original vaccines.

""We don't know yet the magnitude of this improvement but it will likely be pretty limited"" said Dr. Gaston De Serres an epidemiologist at the Quebec National Institute of Public Health (INSPQ).

""Especially against severe outcomes like hospitalization for which up until now the original [vaccines] have been quite successful.""

What can updated COVID vaccines do for you?

More than half of Canadians have been infected with COVID since the emergence of Omicron and its highly contagious subvariants and the added protection from prior infection in a vaccinated population appears to be providing an edge.

A new research letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine looked at the risk of BA.5 infection among people in Portugal who had a prior infection with past variants including BA.1 and BA.2 and found they had strong protection against the newer variant.

That's in part because Portugal has such high levels of vaccination with more than 98 per cent of the population studied having at least two doses meaning that much like in Canada our high levels of two-dose vaccination and infection provide strong immune protection.

Two Canadian preprint studies from May and June  which have not been peer reviewed also found prior Omicron infections provided robust immunity against future reinfection and hospitalization — especially when combined with vaccination.

""In general we can anticipate that those who have hybrid immunity are going to be better protected"" said Dr. Danuta Skowronski a vaccine effectiveness expert and epidemiology lead at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control and co-author of the preprints.

""And it is also true that vaccine strains that are a better match to the circulating variant will likely provide better protection.""

The longer you wait after your last infection or vaccination is also important to consider with emerging evidence suggesting getting a booster too closely after being infected or vaccinated can impact how effective the shot is.

A new small preprint study  which has not been peer reviewed found that getting a booster within two months of an infection could negatively impact B cells that help generate immune protection against severe disease.

NACI recommends waiting three months after an infection before getting another shot and three to six months between doses but also said in its most recent guidance that anyone at high risk of severe COVID in Canada should be offered a fall booster.

""Timing is everything and in general the recommendations are to wait a few months following infection before receiving a booster dose"" Skowronski said.

She added that people shouldn't immediately rush out to get a booster after infection because it could actually interfere with the immune response.

Updated vaccines 'will help' but not a 'miracle'

Canada still has a ""worrisome gap"" in third dose coverage Naylor said with less than half of Canadians having received a booster even though it provides significant added protection against severe COVID-19. Only about 12 per cent have received a fourth dose.

""As we start to head into the fall and we start to see almost certainly cases rise again the updated booster is definitely going to be better than not getting a booster at all"" said Deepta Bhattacharya an immunobiology professor at the University of Arizona.

""Given that BA.5 is still circulating I don't see that there's really any downside at all to picking up these boosters and they'll probably work better than just another shot of the original.""

Bill Hanage an epidemiologist at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston said it's important to consider that even though the original vaccines were far from an exact match to Omicron — they still provided strong protection against severe illness.

""But the closer matches now should do more"" he said in an email. ""Notably there may well be a period following the shot when people are immune to infection.""

Bhattacharya said the ""big question"" that is top of mind right now is how effective the updated vaccines will be at stopping transmission in the real world — and for how long.

""Do we start to restore some of the protection against any infection or symptomatic infection with these boosters? I expect we will"" he said. ""Exactly how long that effect will last I think is to be determined.""

Dr. Allison McGeer a medical microbiologist and infectious disease specialist at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital said the updated shots may provide a slight boost in neutralizing antibodies that can prevent transmission — and that added protection is ""not nothing.""

""An extra dose of the original vaccine results in substantial increased protection against BA.4 and BA.5. It's not perfect but I think we're finding out nothing is perfect"" she said. ""The bivalent vaccines they may be a little better but they're not going to be a miracle.""

Bhattacharya said that while clinical trials showed there is only about a twofold increase in protective antibodies against the BA.1 BA.4 and BA.5 variants targeted by Moderna and Pfiizer in their bivalent vaccines — it's still significant protection.

""If you look at the data it's a ton more antibodies that are being made"" he said. ""So I have every reason to expect that they will help — and probably help a lot.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvbW9kZXJuYS1haW1zLXRvLWdpdmUtaW52ZXN0b3JzLWV4dHJhLWJvb3N0LXdpdGgtNi1pbi0xLXN1cGVyamFiLXp0YnozOWxwNtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Moderna aims to give investors extra boost with 6-in-1 superjab,"A six-in-one super jab that will protect against strains of Covid-19 flu and respiratory syncytial virus — similar to a cold — could be introduced by winter 2025 the UK boss of pharmaceuticals giant Moderna has said.

Darius Hughes was speaking ahead of the launch of the UK’s Covid booster programme tomorrow using Moderna’s new bivalent vaccine which includes protection against both Omicron and the original coronavirus strain.

He said he was confident the company’s messenger RNA technology would give longer-lasting protection. Moderna is desperate to convince investors it can sustain sales of its MRNA vaccines as appetite wanes for booster jabs.

Moderna is already testing separate flu and RSV jabs in the southern hemisphere where Hughes 54 said early data was “very promising”.

What You Need To Know Knott's Berry Farm has rolled out several scary-themed foods and drinks for this year's Scary Farm and Spooky Farm event



This year some of the items include chicken and spicy sausage gumbo with a frog leg garnish and spooky crabby sushi roll



The Knott's food and beverage team begins developing their food and beverage plan for Knott's Spooky Farm a year in advance



The frightening food offering complements the haunted mazes and scary attractions

The black shredded seaweed on top of the crab sushi roll appeared like spider legs on a porch step.

One drink had a plastic syringe half-filled with thick red liquid that looked like blood inside strawberry lemonade.

While the mazes and scare attractions get most of the gory glory at Knott's Scary Farm the themed food prepared for the more than a month-long event is just as frightful.

Knott's Berry Farm's transformation into Knott's Scary Farm and the kiddie version of Knott's Spooky Farm which runs from Sept. 22 to Halloween night Oct. 31 brings out the costumed ghosts and ghouls and shrieks and screams in all forms at the annual Halloween haunted event.

Many of the tens of thousands of visitors are there for the haunted mazes and scare attractions to get the adrenaline pumping. But science shows that emotional distress can create hunger and visitors will get their appetites filled this year.

During this Halloween season the Knott's Berry Farm food and beverage team goes over the top to create a cornucopia menu with crazy concoctions and scary names to enhance the haunt experience.

""We have to compete against the [haunted] mazes"" said Wilf Seymour the food and beverage director at Knott's to Spectrum News. ""When you look at those mazes it's amazing. So we need to put something out that's just as fun.""

This year some of the items on the menu include creepy calamari — calamari rings on a stick — a fearsome foot-long hot dog frighten Philly cheese tater tots ghouls mac and cheese with steak bites and zombie brain mint brownie stuffed inside a red churro.

For drinks the team dresses up some regular glasses with props. The ""I Vant Your Blood"" drink has a plastic syringe filled with a strawberry puree inside a vodka-infused strawberry lemonade. The person has to squeeze down the needle to release the puree into the drink and mix it.

The Redrum drink combined whisky grenadine and pineapple juice with chamoy on the rim of the glass and topped with a small pineapple slice.

Seymour said some drinks like the Black Widow lemonade are also available inside blood bags to add to the spine-chilling-themed fun.

""So you can get these drinks inside a blood bag walk around the park and suck it"" said Seymour.

Dessert is just as fun and scary. The ""It's alive rice Krispie treat"" is a green rice Krispie treat that looks like Frankenstein's monster. They offer a pecan pie brownie bomb and ""Murder Us"" s'mores funnel cake.

And of course fall and Halloween wouldn't be what it is without candy corn pumpkins and squash. The Knott's team incorporates those flavors in some food and drink items.

There's a perilous pumpkin cheesecake funnel cake a pumpkin spice latte and canine candy corn macaron dessert.

Seymour said that coming up with all these types of food is a year-long process.

As the team rolls out this year's horrifying menu items they are already busy developing concepts for next year's Scary Farm.

""We're always thinking of scary stuff"" he said. ""What do people want to eat during the Scary Farm time? So we come up with many items and around this time of year we want to use available ingredients.""

When the team went over concepts for this year's Scary Farm they knew they wanted gumbo on the menu. But how were they going to make it creepy?

Knott's Berry Farm's chef Andre Lane suggested placing fried frog legs in the middle of the chicken and spicy sausage stew.

""We were all like 'Oh gross'"" recalled Seymour. ""But it looks fun and great like that. It kind of creeps people out.""

But some ideas though were too extreme even for a scary event.

For the creepy calamari initially Seymour wanted to fry the whole body of the squid with its head and tentacles and propped up on a wooden stick.

""No one wanted to eat it. It looks really cool but no one wanted to eat it so we ended up with [calamari] rings [on the stick]"" he said. ""It's not exactly what we wanted but it's along the idea of how we wanted to play with it.""

Seymour said there are several rules of thumb the team follows when coming up with food and drinks for the event: It has to have some spice kind of creepy and fun to do. Most items should also be grab-and-go something people can buy and eat as they head to their next maze or scare zone.

The decomposing taco fits the bill: ground beef shredded cheese lettuce and diced tomatoes and tortilla chips inside a bag.

""People love it"" said Seymour. ""Everything is thrown in the bag. They can shake it up and eat it from the bag.""

Seymour knows not all the concepts the team creates will be well-received.

Some of the items presented during a media preview of the event on Thursday had mixed reviews. Some reviewers loved them — others not so much.

In terms of sales Seymour said the Hollow's chicken and hatch chili pizza pie isn't going to sell as well as the traditional plain cheese or pepperoni pizza.

But it's good and essential to have he said.

""You want different tastes and flavors in the park"" he said. ""This is an opportunity to bring something new to Scary Farm and it's always fun to do something creepy.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhc3Rpbmd0YWJsZS5jb20vOTkwMDI2L3RoZS1zcG9va3ktc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWZyYXBwdWNjaW5vLXlvdS1taWdodC1oYXZlLWZvcmdvdHRlbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Spooky Starbucks Frappuccino You Might Have Forgotten,"The Spooky Starbucks Frappuccino You Might Have Forgotten

If there is one thing Starbucks is known for it's their fabulous seasonal beverages. What's fall without a pumpkin spice latte? What's winter without a peppermint mocha? But have they ever taken it a little too far into the realm of the weird and bizarre? If you're a Starbucks fan then you may think you know everything they've ever released.

You probably remember the Pokémon Go Frappuccino or the cotton candy Frappuccino. Remember when the internet was all a twitter over the Unicorn Frappuccino? Multiple coffee fans have even asked Starbucks to bring back the iconic pink drink on Instagram. One wrote ""Can you bring it back? I never got to try it.""

While there has been an abundance of shall we say unique Frappuccino flavors over the years there is one that might evoke a stronger reaction than others.

From Gordon Gekko in Wall Street and Patrick Bateman in American Psycho to the crazed party animals of The Wolf of Wall Street the arena of deal-making is portrayed – particularly in America – as winner-take-all without trace of empathy or redemption.

Industry – the British-made television drama that follows a group of young bankers competing on a City trading floor whose second series airs on BBC1 later this month – is a more subtle example of the genre. Its characters are not monstrous but they are all flawed ruthlessly transactional in their dealings with each other and frankly hard to like. There aren’t any nice guys.

I took the writers Mickey Down and Konrad Kay to lunch at the Ivy Café in Marylebone and asked them why. Both are (like me) former investment bankers themselves – Down was an intern on a mergers and acquisitions team at Rothschild’s Kay lasted a bit longer as an equity salesman at Morgan Stanley. Did they hate every second? Is Industry in effect the therapist’s couch that’s helping them get over the trauma? I had after all been through a similar transition myself and took at least a decade to write the first career out of my system.

Not really they reply separately but in similar words. They liked at least some of their colleagues but both suffered a form of imposter syndrome: the balance sheet analysis behind M&A work was ‘a foreign language I didn’t speak’ says Down. ‘I made so many mistakes I always felt I was about to be found out.’

Is Industry the therapist’s couch helping its writers get over the trauma of working in investment banking?

‘I hated calling clients’ says Kay. ‘And I can barely add multiply or divide. I had to work really hard to be really average.’ If they looked forward to anything it was Friday afternoons when they could at last wind down and go to the pub. Do they miss any aspect of it now? ‘Only the tailoring’ says Kay again. ‘We liked the dressing up.’

That dates them to the early 2010s when they escaped. Today’s trading floors are mostly more dressed-down than the Industry version a minor detail in what’s otherwise as viewers from the City tend to agree a very authentic portrayal of the milieu – including financial detail that you don’t have to grasp to enjoy the drama but which makes sense if you do. In the second series we’re promised more contemporary political background but will the protagonists who survived from the first series have learned to treat each other more kindly?

No spoilers here. Suffice to say that Kenny the Northern Irish foreign exchange trader (played by Conor MacNeill) who has a tortured relationship with his manipulative sexpot assistant Yasmin (Marisa Abela) has had to go into rehab poor fellow. As for the tension between Harper (Myha’la Herrold) the street-smart black kid who lied about her college degree to get the job and her inscrutable veteran boss Eric (Ken Leung) all Kay will say is: ‘It’s a twist on that age-old thing how you always have to kill the one you love.’

Later in the conversation he refers to William Golding’s Lord of the Flies as a ‘story engine’ for the series. But will there be as much sex and drugs as in the earlier episodes? ‘Oh yes. More actually.’

Kay an English literature graduate is the funnier and more mischievous of the pair. Down whose mother is Ghanaian and who studied theology seems gentler and more cerebral on brief acquaintance – though I observe that his lunch choice of steak tartare has a touch of the macho banker to it. They’re both far more likeable than the people they dream up; and having been writing together since they first teamed up at Oxford they are clearly well in tune with each other’s thinking.

One of their first joint efforts was a play at the Edinburgh Festival about a fake moon landing ‘with a huge amount of swearing’. Then they wrote a first version of Industry as a fly-on-the-wall docudrama but it was too harshly honest to be entertaining. Finally they got lucky in 2017 with a commission from HBO for the first series of eight Industry episodes that became a co-production with the BBC and premièred to generally positive reviews on both sides of the Atlantic in November 2020.

The HBO relationship has been great for them: ‘They just let us get on with it’ says Kay. ‘It’s the full-on American “showrunner” way of doing things and on series two it has been flawless conflictless – really joined up. We don’t trust anyone else to make our show so we’re involved in every casting every edit every music choice.’

‘The actors are very engaged with the psychology of their characters and there are other writers on some episodes’ adds Down. ‘But we give them a detailed scene-by-scene synopsis and we edit every line.’

As for the BBC’s input ‘they top up the budget for each episode’ but do they I wonder also ask for more BBC-ish storylines of the kind that deliver subliminal messages on race gender climate and the evils of capitalism? Does anyone at Broadcasting House ever say: ‘Can’t you give us moral uplift and happy endings a bit more Call the Midwife?’ ‘Not at all’ says Kay guffawing at the comparison. ‘This is a drama that never moralises and never stops to explain. We could write 20 series of it but good’s never going to triumph.’

And no pressure from the backers to reduce that unusually high quotient of shagging and substance-abuse? ‘Oh no quite the contrary.’

It helps that the show is a relative bargain coming in at a fraction of the cost per episode of long-form television hits such as Succession the Murdoch-lookalike media-dynasty drama replete with helicopters penthouses and superyachts. Industry by contrast is largely filmed in Cardiff in a former electronics factory space that’s been converted into a trading floor. So if audiences keep tuning in many more episodes could be in prospect.

But don’t Kay and Down feel an urge for pastures new having given such powerful expression to an unhappy passage of their own past lives? Yes and no. They want to stick with television because ‘no one writes films any more except maybe Marvel superhero stuff’. And the episodic format eight hours (with the possibility of more) rather than two gives far greater scope for storytelling without the tough discipline of having to write a definitive ending.

They’re also aiming to escape writing about banking at least some of the time. There’s a murder mystery in development a sort of ‘Gosford Park with cocaine’ and an update of a 1960s spy drama – though I sense they’re nervous as to how critics might react to very different material coming from ‘those boys who wrote Industry’. No need to worry I’d say. They have a talent for character an ear for dialogue and a rare creative chemistry between them: let’s see what they come up with next.

The government’s cash balances have nearly halved in about a month to Rs 2.3 lakh crore as it accelerates spending on infrastructure. Higher federal spending though potentially inflationary should boost economic growth that fell below even the central bank’s forecast last quarter.Cash balances with the government were at Rs 2.3 lakh crore on September 1 compared with Rs 4.2 lakh crore on July 29 showed central bank data compiled by Bank of Baroda Research. The gauge was at Rs 5.1 lakh crore on July 1.“Clearly there has been a tendency for the government to progressively start spending as per budget which has brought these balances down” said Madan Sabnavis  chief economist Bank of Baroda.“While this may put pressure on inflation on the demand side the central bank is well poised to manage it through policy tools.” “With the June quarter growth falling short of projections the focus is now to ramp up growth as well"" he said.The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) projected the real GDP growth for 2022-23 at 7.2% with April-June quarter at 16.2% showed data from its policy document dated April 8. India’s GDP expanded 13.5% in the June quarter of FY23.Sector-wise growth exhibited broad-based pickup barring government consumption according to a report by Morgan Stanley . So the September quarter is expected to show higher government consumption.“Spending by the government will release money into the system"" said Soumyajit Niyogi director at India Ratings. “This will reduce the gap between surplus durable liquidity and surplus in the banking system.”“However sustained pressure from BoP (Balance of Payment) deficit or frictional volatility owing to monthly tax payment will continue to create volatility in the system"" he said.Meanwhile the surplus cash in the banking system was at Rs 1.43 lakh crore on September 1 compared with `3.26 lakh crore at the beginning of July. High levels in July could also be attributed to advance tax payments. Advance taxes are generally paid by July 15. These balances are treated as surpluses until they are spent."

India toppled the UK from its position in the final three months of 2021 to become the fifth-biggest economy. The calculation is based in US dollars and India extended its lead in the first quarter according to GDP figures from the International Monetary Fund.

This news comes as a further blow to the government in London as it grapples with a brutal cost-of-living shock Bloomberg reported.

The IMF`s own forecasts show India overtaking the UK in dollar terms on an annual basis this year putting the Asian powerhouse behind just the US China Japan and Germany. A decade ago India ranked 11th among the largest economies while the UK was 5th.

The UK`s decline down the international rankings is an unwelcome backdrop for the new Prime Minister. Conservative Party members choose Boris Johnson`s successor on Monday with Foreign Secretary Liz Truss expected to beat former Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak in the run-off.

The winner will take over a nation facing the fastest inflation in four decades and rising risks of a recession that the Bank of England says may last well into 2024.

By contrast the Indian economy is forecast to grow more than 7 per cent this year. A world-beating rebound in Indian stocks this quarter has just seen their weighting rise to the second spot in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index trailing only China`s.

The calculations were done using the IMF database and historic exchange rates on the Bloomberg terminal.

The UK is likely to have fallen further since. UK GDP grew just one per cent in cash terms in the second quarter and after adjusting for inflation shrank 0.1 per cent. Sterling has also underperformed the dollar relative to the rupee with the pound falling eight per cent against the Indian currency this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHl0aW1lcy5jb20ucGsvOTkxOTIxL2luZGlhLW5vdy13b3JsZHMtZmlmdGgtbGFyZ2VzdC1lY29ub215LW92ZXJ0YWtlcy11ay_SAVlodHRwczovL2RhaWx5dGltZXMuY29tLnBrLzk5MTkyMS9pbmRpYS1ub3ctd29ybGRzLWZpZnRoLWxhcmdlc3QtZWNvbm9teS1vdmVydGFrZXMtdWsvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India now world's fifth largest economy Overtakes UK,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='dailytimes.com.pk', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /991921/india-now-worlds-fifth-largest-economy-overtakes-uk/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000018F6E180D50>, 'Connection to dailytimes.com.pk timed out.

It is the time of the year when Kerala is exhilarated with music songs dances sadya along with huge events of boat rides and delicious Onasadya.

While the festivities started on August 30 itself Onam will see its biggest celebrations on September 8. Traditionally speaking the festival falls in the month of Chingam according to the Malayalam calendar.

Significance of Onam:

According to Hindu Mythology the sage Prahlada had a grandson named Mahabali. He took over the three worlds by defeating the Gods (Devas).

Then the Gods approached Lord Vishnu to help them in the battle against Mahabali Vishnu refused considering Mahabali being a good ruler and his devotee.

Post his victory Mahabali performed a Yajna after his victory over the Gods and had to grant anyone any request. Lord Vishnu took this opportunity to test Mahabali's devotion and approached Mahabali in the avatar of a dwarf boy called Vamana.

The king offered everything to the boy but he was adamant on seeking three-paces. Mahabali although surprised by the boy's wish agreed to grant it.

Vamana grew and covered the land and water with one foot and the sky with another foot now to place his third-foot Mahabali offered himself.

Vamana trampled Mahabali down to Pathala (hell) but pleased by his devotion offered him a boon to visit his land every year. The revisit of Mahabali marks the festival of Onam.

Onam Wishes to send to your family and friends:

Happy Onam!! May Lord Mahabali bring happiness and prosperity to your life.

On this festive day I wish you a wonderful Onam. May your house be filled with joy happiness and peace. Happy Onam!

Here's wishing you all a prosperous happy colorful bright healthy wealthy and wise Onam.

Onam is a celebration of the homecoming of Mahabali. May you get the opportunity to enjoy the love and bounties of nature by sharing it with your friends and family.",,,

In August Amazon announced its all-cash deal of $61 per share to acquire iRobot.

According to industry data iRobot's Roomba dominates the smart vacuum market with a 75% market share by revenue in the U.S.

The FTC's antitrust review includes a look at both head-to-head competition and whether the deal would illegally boost Amazon's market share in the connected device and retail markets.

Earlier in August Bloomberg quoted an Amazon spokesperson saying that the company would continue to supply retailers with iRobot products and sell competing devices on Amazon's retail websites.

In the wake of a report by the FTC last year Khan has insisted the agency take a closer look at the acquisitions made by the tech firms.

According to the report companies like Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon used loopholes to avoid antitrust scrutiny on smaller deals.

FaZe Holdings Inc has released the required filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission which gives a deep look into their current financials.

Notably their Jul. merger with B. Riley Principal 150 Merger Corp which allowed them to be listed on the Nasdaq was expected to raise $218 million. However it only raised $100.2 million.

Falling short of a financial target by $117.8m is bound to cause issues and the filing stated as follows:

Accordingly we have less cash available to pursue our anticipated growth strategies and new initiatives than we projected. This may cause significant delays in or limit the scope of our planned acquisition strategy and our planned international expansion.

The international expansion in question refers to their pilot markets of Brazil Europe and Thailand with their Rainbow Six roster and streamers being their lone presence in Brazil.

In particular FaZe detailed plans to monetise their global audience further as they stated that “[FaZe’s] historical sponsorship and talent deals have been largely with US-domestic partners” and that they are “working to build the infrastructure necessary to monetize our brand and grow brand awareness outside of North America… with plans for a significant rollout in 2022”.

For example while the company has caught a lot of attention with their recent partnerships with Disney McDonalds DoorDash Naruto DC Comics and the NFL these are only available to American fans. They planned to grow similar partnerships in regions such as Brazil however this growth will likely be delayed due to the $100m in lower earnings than expected.

The filing states that during the first six months of 2022 41.9% of FaZe’s audience was from outside of North America but they made up only 9% of revenue.

We plan on expanding our global brand presence in international markets by following the same strategy we have successfully executed in the U.S.: developing and signing talent expanding our content platforms to produce targeted content internationally and leveraging the growth of digital and social platforms.

For fans of the Brazilian Rainbow Six roster this means that despite their success -- they won the Sweden Major and were a single round away from the Berlin Major title -- FaZe’s growth into Brazil may slow this year and may not be as deep as the company wished.

This is in contrast to Team Liquid who this year launched a localised Brazilian store and released their fan engagement platform Liquid+ in the region on Sep. 1. FaZe still lack a localised store with items being sold on the Fallen Store instead

To help with these plans FaZe on Thursday Aug. 25 hired Christoph Pachler as the company's new Chief Financial Officer. He will oversee all aspects of FaZe’s financial management and will likely have a very busy year ahead of him. Pachler previously worked for Sony and Playboy Enterprises helping the latter company go private in 2011.

The filing also made clear just how important sponsorships were to FaZe Clan’s business with 60.4% of all revenue coming from “commercial revenue” in the first half of this year while last year FaZe’s G Fuel sponsorship made up 12% of the companies revenue. This is notable as the 10-year-long G Fuel-FaZe Clan partnership ended in May of this year. Most of FaZe’s partners currently do not have a notable presence in Brazil.

More details surrounding FaZe Clan will be released at the end of the month in their third quarter financial report.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0YXIuY29tLm15L2J1c2luZXNzL2J1c2luZXNzLW5ld3MvMjAyMi8wOS8wMy91bmV4LWhvbGRpbmdzLWFpbXMtZm9yLW5hc2RhcS1saXN0aW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Unex Holdings aims for Nasdaq listing,"PETALING JAYA: Green technology company Unex Holdings Inc is aiming to raise up to US$40mil (RM179.36mil) for its business expansion in the run-up to a listing on the Nasdaq market in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Unex is currently listed on the United States over-the-counter market and wants to revise listing statues after acquiring the heating ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) business of EvoAir International Ltd in December 2021. EvoAir International is the parent company of the WKL Group which is involved in the research and development manufacturing marketing and distribution of its eco-friendly hybrid air-conditioning systems.

Pending approval from the United States regulator Unex’s name will be changed to EvoAir Holdings Inc.

EvoAir Group CEO Dr Low Wai Koon said the group’s green technology is timely in view of global warming and climate change issues.

Group managing director Kevin Chan added the EvoAir air-conditioner systems have seen encouraging sales in Malaysia since early this year. Chan explained its factories in Kepong Kuala Lumpur and Foshan City Guangdong province China were set up last year prior to product commercialisation in January 2022.

“Based on a single eight-hour shift the factories can produce 2500 to 3000 units monthly. Some major property developers shopping malls and factories are using our products” said Chan after the group announced it had engaged Network 1 Financial Securities Inc as lead managing underwriter and book runner for its offering in conjunction with its proposed listing on Nasdaq.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9zdG9ja3MvbmV3cy93YXMtcmFrZXNoLWpodW5qaHVud2FsYS1pbmRpYXMtbGFzdC1zdG9jay1tYXJrZXQtYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTM5Nzg5NzMuY21z0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL3N0b2Nrcy9uZXdzL3dhcy1yYWtlc2gtamh1bmpodW53YWxhLWluZGlhcy1sYXN0LXN0b2NrLW1hcmtldC1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZS9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTM5Nzg5NzMuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Was Rakesh Jhunjhunwala India’s last stock market billionaire?,"







It's tough to become a billionaire but nearly impossible if you want to take the Dalal Street route to riches as the late Rakesh Jhunjhunwala did by starting with just Rs 5000 and a CA degree in his pocket.While a small motley group of traders and investors have become crorepatis in the last few years hardly any of them have been able to make it to that elusive billionaires club solely on the basis of their investments in the stock market. And now as the markets are becoming more and more efficient worldwide with the free flow of information and the shifting of high-risk capital to the startup ecosystem the business of investing is also evolving and a part of it is shifting to the private market.Fondly known as the ‘Big Bull’ Jhunjhunwala was the biggest individual investor on Dalal Street and left a wealth of around $5.8 billion or Rs 46000 crore. Although his close friend and investor Radhakishan Damani made more money than him of over $22 billion most of his riches are because of Avenue Supermarts or DMart where Damani is a promoter.Other big individual investors on Dalal Street include the likes of Mukul Agrawal Ashish Dhawan (who is also a private equity investor) Ashish Kacholia and Anil Kumar Goel. None of them are however billionaires Trendlyne data shows.“With just investing it is almost impossible to become a billionaire today because there is so little inefficiency in the system and everyone is factoring in all the news almost instantly” opines Zerodha Founder and CEO Nithin Kamath.The other problem today is that by the time a company lists on the stock exchanges they are already juiced out by private equity investors who have valued it more than whatever the company can do in the next 5-10 years. This is in sharp contrast to the initial history of India Inc when companies used debt or internal resources to grow before launching their IPOs. Some such minnows of their time like HDFC Bank and Infosys  who hardly had any PE or VC funds chasing them are now bluechips and have given multibagger returns in the long run.“It is very tough to be a public market investor and be able to make the kind of wealth Jhunjhunwala did but in the private space it is still possible because you can be early in some of these companies” Kamath says.Jhunjhunwala who minted a fortune with stocks like Titan  Sesa Goa (now Vedanta ) CRISIL and Lupin  himself had realised it as he had been betting big in the unlisted space in the last few years.Recently-listed companies like Nazara Technologies  Barbeque Nation Metro Brands and Star Health were all picked by him well before their IPOs.While there are many bulls on Dalal Street Jhunjhunwala might turn out to be India’s last ‘Big Bull’ and even the last stock market billionaire",,,

‘How to Train Your Dragon 2’ (Sept. 10)

Dreamworks’s “Dragon” trilogy is frequently overlooked in the sphere of contemporary family entertainment (thanks primarily to the Disney/Pixar juggernaut) but this series of family adventures is terrific wittily written gorgeously rendered and boasting an all-star cast (including Jay Baruchel Gerard Butler Craig Ferguson America Ferrera Jonah Hill and Kristen Wiig). The most successful installment is probably this sequel an Oscar nominee for best animated feature which deepens the bond between the meek Viking kid Hiccup (Baruchel) and his dragon Toothless while adding the considerable gravitas of Cate Blanchett in the role of Hiccup’s long-lost mother.

‘Saved by the Bell’ (Sept. 14)

During its lengthy run as part of NBC’s Saturday morning lineup “Saved by the Bell” was mostly a punchline — an easy shorthand for silly tween entertainment chronicling the adventures of the fourth-wall-breaking smart-aleck Zack; his best girl Kelly; and their pals Slater Jessie Lisa and Screech. But there’s no denying the series’s easy charm and considerable reach to say nothing of the affectionate nostalgia it prompts among ’90s kids. Netflix is dropping its “Saved by the Bell” collection which includes the entire original series as well as the one-season spinoff “The College Years” and the feature-length movies “Hawaiian Style” and “Wedding in Las Vegas.”

‘Blade Runner: The Final Cut/2049’ (Sept. 25)

Ridley Scott’s 1982 sci-fi-action classic was years ahead of its time a hybrid of high-tech adventure and film noir featuring Harrison Ford as a detective in a dystopian Los Angeles hired to hunt down rogue androids. A critical and commercial failure when it hit theaters “Blade Runner” was released in a compromised version that Scott continued to adjust and revise until his 2007 “final cut” received a full-scale theatrical release and all the praise it deserved. In his big-budget 2017 sequel “Blade Runner 2049” starring Ryan Gosling with Ford reprising his role the director Denis Villeneuve wisely doesn’t attempt to ape Scott’s distinctive style. Instead he crafts a melancholy dread-filled narrative that plays by its own rules.

The farmers said the initiative had helped them to get adequate quantities of fertilizers to boost their crops.

They added that it had also helped them to save money to cater for other pressing needs.

The farmers therefore expressed joy in the presence of a team from Yara Ghana who visited some fertilizer retailing and distribution shops in the region to monitor the Grow Ghana initiative.

The Yara team visited retailers and distributors at Kpalsogu in the Tolon District and Tamale where scores of farmers had gathered to buy fertilizer to benefit from the Grow Ghana initiative.

The team also visited a two-acre maize demonstration farm at Nyankpala in the Tolon District where crops that had benefitted from the fertilizer application were doing well.

Under the Grow Ghana initiative which was launched by Yara Ghana Limited a fertilizer company farmers are to buy two bags of fertilizer and receive one bag for free.

Mr Yakubu Abdul Hafiz a pepper and rice farmer from Tonjing in the Kumbungu District who bought two bags of the fertilizer and received one bag for free at Kpalsogu said “This year getting access to fertilizer is a challenge. The price is a challenge. Even if you have the money getting the fertilizer too is a challenge. It is very scarce these days.”

He said: “So having this initiative to help us is good and laudable. I will encourage Yara Ghana to continue this initiative.

“This initiative will help us a lot. Because of the price we cannot get enough fertilizer for our crops but because of this free one when you add it will really help us a lot.”

Mr Adam Osman a rice maize and groundnut farmer from Tonjing in the Kumbungu District said “I am happy about this initiative. It will help us improve our yields. The money for the free one will be channeled to other pressing needs.”

Mr Abukari Haruna who applied the fertilizer to his two-acre maize farm at Nyankpala in the Tolon District said his field was doing well adding that he expected his yields to increase significantly compared to previous years.

Mr Danquah Addo Yobo West Africa Regional Director of Yara International said as part of the Grow Ghana initiative Yara Ghana had committed $20 million to help farmers through providing 18000 tonnes of fertilizers (360000 bags of 50kg Yara Mila Actyva – of fertilizer) to farmers for free.

He said: “We have targeted key crop producing areas so that we can reach a lot of farmers and significantly support food production in the country.

“The product we have put into the package is the Yara Mila Actyva which is our premium product which the farmers know; fantastic product works very well on cereals.”

“We expect that as part of the initiative we should be able to support production of at least 500000 metric tonnes of cereals. We are also targeting to reach at least 100000 smallholder farmers.”

Mr Addo Yobo therefore urged the farmers to follow the right farming practices and the right application of the fertilizers and see farming as business to ensure sustainability.",,,,,,,,,,,,

President Macron has chosen Frédéric Michel – former advisor to Prime Minister Tony Blair and associate of Rupert Murdoch’s son James – as his new special advisor for communication and strategy.

As an expert in crisis management Mr Michel has been hired in a bid to communicate with people in France about the actions being taken by the Elysée as well as to explain the link between domestic and international policies and strengthen diplomatic relations with Europe reported Le Journal du Dimanche today.

He will also be one of the President’s main links to the press.

Mr Michel is from Poitiers and was educated at Sciences Po in Bordeaux and the London School of Economics. He quickly rose through the ranks of New Labour and its think tanks and created the Policy Network group (a centre-left policy reform group) for Mr Blair.

He also created his own ‘corporate reputation’ agency - earning him his own reputation as something of a ‘spin doctor’ – and was once chief UK lobbyist for Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp during the controversial Leveson inquiry into press ethics and behaviour.

He was forced to resign after a scandal erupted when the Leveson inquiry published a report showing private exchanges with then Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt.

He later formed links with James Murdoch Rupert’s eldest son.

James Murdoch has publicly moved away from his father and instead taken on environmental and social issues. After leaving NewsCorp in 2020 James launched an environmental campaign with Mr Michel in a bid to raise awareness of the future of the planet’s oceans and responsible consumption.

They also established private investment vehicle Lupa Systems based in New York and Mumbai to invest in arts and culture and to fight against fake news. It also works on life sciences education and the influence of tech on geopolitics.

Lupa Systems is an investor in French media company Brut and Mr Michel is also a board member at French newspaper Les Inrocks.

Tara told CBS8: “It was painful! I was like ‘uh’. I jumped out of the water and this was so shocking.

“I had blood all over my foot and in between my toes. It was like small piranhas had bit me.”

The creatures that are attacked are isopods called Excirolana chiltoni which live in the shallow waters of the Pacific Ocean.

Seasonally the bugs migrate up and down the coast.

Ryan Hechinger a professor at Scripps Institution of Oceanography told CB8 the creatures feed on fresh meat.

He said: “It is an isopod a relative of roly-polys that live in the ocean and in very shallow waters all the way up to Alaska and Japan.

“They are totally known to bite people. They like to eat fresh meat like a dying animal or battered animal.”

""As coal becomes more scarce and expensive the company has stepped up production from its captive mines. Production from Sial Ghogri coal mine has already been ramped up to 30000 tonnes per month which is 20 per cent higher than its peak rated capacity"" it said.

It has accelerated the development of the Bikram coal mine and it is expected that production will start by the fourth quarter of financial year 2022-2023.

Throughout her more than 30-year career Williams has used her platform to break barriers for female athletes. And with help from Nike that’s only going to continue.

For instance Nike and Williams created the Serena Williams Design Crew design apprenticeship program in 2019 to promote diversity in design and establish a new generation of design talent at Nike and beyond. In January 2020 the first group of young talents visited the brand’s headquarters in Beaverton Ore. and worked for six months to produce footwear apparel and accessories inspired by the tennis icon in the worlds of performance and lifestyle product. Since then the program has only advanced.

Tanya Hvizdak VP of global women’s sports marketing at Nike told FN that Nike currently has 13 apprentices in the program from Williams’ hometown of Compton Calif.

“Serena is extremely passionate about design. And she’s also passionate about providing opportunities to groups that maybe haven’t necessarily been afforded those platforms. And through our partnership she saw an opportunity to give designers young people passionate in that space the opportunity to work with an incredible organization and elevate them. It’s allowed for a new group of diverse individuals into our organization to really help push and bring new thought and experience into that space” explained Hvizdak.

Williams was also a central force in the launch of one of Nike’s most far-reaching platforms in years The Nike Athlete Think Tank. Through this initiative athletes are able to provide unfiltered feedback about their unique journeys and the changes they wanted to see regarding financial aspect of creating access to sport inclusion and community efforts among other topics.

“She was part of that first inaugural crew. And that really laid the foundation. I’m excited to say that we’re in our second cohort. And Serena has expressed interest in continuing to be involved” said Hvizdak.

Last month Williams covered Vogue’s September issue where she announced her plans in a verbal essay with the magazine. “I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis toward other things that are important to me” she said.

Hvizdak is excited about what the future holds. “The thing that’s most incredible is just she transcends sport. The amount of decades and generations that she’s been able to impact is just absolutely incredible. And I think what she’ll continue to bring will be even more impactful. And she spoke to that a little bit when she was talking about her retirement and how she’s excited about what the evolution of Serena means” Hvizdak said.

Hvizdak added that the tennis star’s authenticity and unapologetic self has connected with consumers through the years and continues to do so today.

“Serena is so integral into the push that we’ve seen. She’s showing what’s possible whether it’s Serena Ventures or the SWDC she continues to break glass ceilings. And that’s where you see us as a brand continuing to lean in. We continue to say that sport has the ability to move the world forward. And in Serena she just exemplifies that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc25lYWtlcm5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDMvbmlrZS1haXItbWFjLWF0dGFjay0yMDIzLXJlbGVhc2UtaW5mby_SAUlodHRwczovL3NuZWFrZXJuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzAzL25pa2UtYWlyLW1hYy1hdHRhY2stMjAyMy1yZWxlYXNlLWluZm8v?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nike Air Mac Attack Returning In 2023,"This post contains references to products from one or more of our advertisers.

One of the most cherished tennis sneakers in history is rumored to make a return to stores for the first time next year.

According to Complex the Air Mac Attack — originally releasing in 1984 — is set to return for the first time ever in 2023 in original colorways while modern treatments are likely to come as well. Additionally a collaboration with retailer Social Status is expected to release in May of next year.

The Air Mac Attack is considered a grail-status collectible among vintage Nike hoarders. Vintage sneaker collector Jon Migdal aka @migdallion (whose we featured here) also sourced a pair for LeBron James who wore them sometime in 2021.

The closest we’ve ever gotten to an Air Mac Attack was the Air Manor; this lifestyle focused model did not feature a Swoosh logo and was considered entirely as a lifestyle sneaker option alongside other NikeLab offerings as well as collaborations with menswear brand Steven Alan.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzEwMDQ3NjU5LWtldmluLWR1cmFudC1yZXZlYWxzLW5pa2Uta2QxNS1wcm9kdWNlci1wYWNrLXNob2VzLXdpdGgtYm9pLTFkYS1jYXJkby05dGgtd29uZGVy0gGNAWh0dHBzOi8vc3luZGljYXRpb24uYmxlYWNoZXJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2FtcC8xMDA0NzY1OS1rZXZpbi1kdXJhbnQtcmV2ZWFscy1uaWtlLWtkMTUtcHJvZHVjZXItcGFjay1zaG9lcy13aXRoLWJvaS0xZGEtY2FyZG8tOXRoLXdvbmRlci5hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kevin Durant Reveals Nike KD15 'Producer Pack' Shoes with Boi-1da Cardo & 9th Wonder,"AP Photo/John Minchillo

The new buildings will be energy efficient with high sustainability standards as well as the excellent facilities operating at net zero.

Transforming the learning environment and supporting teachers will help deliver high-quality education which will in turn allow the pupils to gain the knowledge skills and qualifications they need to succeed.

We at Bishop Wilkinson Catholic Education Trust and St Leonard’s Catholic School will work with the Department for Education to agree the educational design of the project and the timeframe for delivery.

Over the course of the work St Leonard’s will continue to provide the highest level of education to their pupils despite the changes being made to the school's infrastructure.

Mr Chris Hamill headteacher at St Leonard’s Catholic School said: “The school is very excited to be prioritised for the Government’s flagship School Rebuilding Programme. We can’t wait to see the positive changes and how it will help improve the performance of the staff as well as the pupils.”

Across the School Rebuilding Programme the rebuilds and refurbishments will create modern education environments providing new facilities from classrooms and science labs to sports halls and dining rooms.

The new school buildings will also be net-zero carbon in operation helping meet the government’s net zero target.

The programme is due to deliver 500 rebuilding projects over the next decade which will benefit tens of thousands of pupils over their lifetime.

Nick Hurn OBE CEO of Bishop Wilkinson Catholic Education Trust said: “The new provision and accommodation that will be provided by the School Rebuilding Programme for the children staff and communities of St Leonards and St Josephs Junior school in Birtley as a result of this investment will be transformational.""

St Leonard’s Catholic School is part of an announcement of 61 new projects including primary secondary and special schools levelling up opportunities across the entire country.

James Cleverly Education Secretary said: “Our School Rebuilding Programme is already making a difference to the lives of pupils and their teachers. It is creating greener school sites that are fit for the future and that local communities can be proud of. We know how important it is to have high-quality school facilities. That is why we continue to invest billions in our rebuilding programme.”

Bill was born in Cranford NJ on March 24 1935 but grew up in Westfield NJ. He graduated from Pennsylvania Military Preparatory School in 1953 before attending Trinity College where he majored in Government and graduated in 1957. Upon graduation he was commissioned as an officer and served in the United States Air Force for over 24 years eventually retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel. Bill was a very proud veteran and his service included time as a Navigator and Weapons Officer as well as an Intelligence Officer for the National Security Agency. He had postings in multiple locations around the world to include a tour in Vietnam. After military retirement Bill worked as a Defense Contractor for Sterling Software and Northrop Grumman.

Bill met his wife Nancy while he was stationed in Germany and they were subsequently married on March 26 1966. Not long after being married they welcomed there first son Bill and only a few years later Greg was born.

Bill was a strong Christian and enjoyed volunteering and serving in a multitude of positions within the church. In addition he was a diehard Cornhusker fan and both family and friends will long remember the silent sentinel perched on the end of his seat willing Nebraska to win at any cost. Bill also loved to travel and he and Nancy enjoyed many memorable trips to England Ireland Norway and New Zealand.

Being a grandpa was a true joy to Bill. Whether it was basketball tae kwon do hockey or wrestling Papa loved watching and attending all the events. He happily played board and card games with his grandchildren and sometimes just simply enjoyed watching them construct some new Lego creation or observe the simple everyday banter.

Bill is survived by his wife Nancy; children Bill (Amanda) and Greg (Jennifer); four grandchildren Jack Miles Lily and Kaeden; and sister Peri.

Memorial services will be held in Nebraska at 11 a.m. on Saturday September 17 2022 at Thanksgiving Church Bellevue; and in Virginia at 11 a.m. on Thursday September 22 2022 at Covenant Funeral Service Fredericksburg. Interment will take place at a later date in Arlington National Cemetery.

Ross became famous in 1994 with Marvels which used traditional painting to depict superheroes. He’s a legend in the world of comics.

Full Circle uses pen ink and color rather than paint but the images still explode off the page with awesome energy. The book is a throwback to the high adventure of 1960s Marvel Comics infused with hope for the future and American pride in the space program and free of political correctness.

Marvel giants and Fantastic Four creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby came down on the side of America and the family particularly against their arch-nemesis Dr. Doom. He was a dictator from the Soviet-style Latveria in Eastern Europe. Doom’s one demand was that his subjects be “happy” at any cost. The frozen smiles of the people of Latveria was a direct commentary on the coercive Utopia offered by communism. Jack Kirby’s art was a celebration of the human form in action as well as an awesome immersion into the astonishing wonders of outer space.

A Throwback to a Happier Time

Fantastic Four: Full Circle is based on events first depicted in 1966’s Fantastic Four #51. An intruder breaking into the Baxter Building the home of the FF sends Reed Richard Johnny and Sure Storm and Ben Grim on a mission to a world beyond the microscopic world: the Negative Zone. It’s a science fiction story about traveling to strange new worlds in space defending the innocent and forging new alliances with like-minded new friends. “It seemed very suitable for the material” creator Ross recently told the Hollywood Reporter:

To do the pop art aesthetic right you couldn’t do it with over-rendered over-illustrated work. I needed to boil down what I do to a more graphic degree. Realism is my stock and trade but you can still get that within a more high-contrast representation.

Ross said he “wanted to present a version of the Fantastic Four as close to a Jack Kirby style he envisioned for the series as he created the characters. His style informed the first 10 years of their existence and it’s the shadow all artists have been working under for these last 60 years.”

A Dash of Humor

While Ross’s art is glorious it is totally different from Jack Kirby’s. The latter’s block figures were almost the opposite of realism something that is an advantage when depicting the fantasy world of comics. Also — and this always gets ignored or downplayed — Kirby was one of the funniest artists of the 20th century. His exaggerations and comic blasts were not just cool they were often slapstick. Even in the sea of a world-threatening battle he could come up with sight gags or put the characters in situations that were delightfully slapstick.

Please Support The Stream : Equipping Christians to Think Clearly About the Political Economic and Moral Issues of Our Day.

In one of my favorites issues from the 1960s the FF fights the Sandman. At one point this villain drops rock-monster The Thing into a sand cylinder and starts rolling him towards the Hudson River. It’s a hilarious sight gag made even better by the dialogue. “This is the last time you’re going to mess with my plans” Sandman says. “Izzat so?” the Thing replies. “Whatcha aimin’ to do — leave town?”

How We Got So Dark

Comics driven by the success of the Batman “Dark Knight” model have lost so much of the pure pro-American joy that once made Marvel so beloved by fans. In the comics of the 1960s we got humor patriotism romantic love that resulted in marriage and children and moments of pure happiness and optimism.

The Marvel Universe began in early 1961 the forward-looking dawn of Kennedy’s New Frontier. It was that year that comic book writer Stan Lee was given permission by his publisher Martin Goodman who was envious of rival DC Comics’ successful Justice League comic to create a comic with a team of superheroes. Lee and genius co-creator Jack Kirby (both men were veterans of World War II) came up with The Fantastic Four a family who develop superpowers when their spaceship is blasted with gamma rays.

Reed Richards Susan and Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm argued and got irritated with each other but their lives were also filled with humor love and a passionate desire to defend American ideals and freedom. If the show runners of the planned new Fantastic Four movie keep this in mind they could make it another hit like Top Gun: Maverick.

A Bigger Stick Than the Other Guy

The first Marvel films of the last decade tapped into this winning formula. In 2008’s Iron Man hero Tony Stark (Robbert Downey Jr.) is a genius inventor and industrialist whose family got rich manufacturing weapons. Early in the film Stark is confronted by a reporter from Vanity Fair. “Let me guess — Berkeley?” Stark replies when she accuses him of being a “merchant of death” and war profiteer. “The day that weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace I’ll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals.” He adds “Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy” noting that several technological breakthroughs that aided humanity came directly from military research and funding.

This exchange with the liberal reporter in Iron Man had an interesting recent real-life analog. At the 2017 New York comic convention Marvel Entertainment announced it would be partnering with defense giant Northrop Grumman to produce a one-shot comic book. The comic which would feature a team of Northrop Grumman-themed heroes was aimed at encouraging young people to go into STEM fields. But Marvel was flooded with responses to the tweeted announcement the vast majority of them negative. Many comparisons were made between this event and the movie version of Iron Man a billionaire CEO of a weapons company who after seeing the effects his weapons have on innocents turns his company away from developing weapons.

Bowing to the Latverian mob Marvel cancelled the event. In a statement to pop-culture site Polygon.com Marvel said:

The activation with Northrop Grumman at New York Comic Con was meant to focus on aerospace technology and exploration in a positive way. However as the spirit of that intent has not come across we will not be proceeding with this partnership including this weekend’s event programming. Marvel and Northrop Grumman continue to be committed to elevating and introducing STEM to a broad audience.

Writing at Defense News Aaron Mehta noted that ComicCon was a bad place to launch the initiative as comic conventions tend to attract more liberal and “reactive” attendees. Mehta also noted the hypocrisy of the left-wing critics of comics:

To be fair there is some dissonance here. Marvel fans have no problem rooting on the X-Men who famously fly around in a modified SR-71 Blackbird; one of the characters has a pet dragon literally named Lockheed. Iron Man may have renounced his defense industry profits but he still flies around in an up-armored robotic suit and at one point served as U.S. secretary of defense.

Stopping hypersonic missile attacks will likely rely heavily upon data sharing high-speed data processing and artificial intelligence (AI).

The challenge for hypersonic missile defense is to establish a continuous track of a weapon moving more than five times the speed of sound while implementing a countermeasure such as an interceptor or jamming method to disrupt the missile’s flight trajectory or airflow.

Either of these options would be reliant on the speed of information transmission which is why the Missile Defense Agency and industry partners are working on a number of programs to establish a continuous track.

When a missile traveling that fast passes from one radar field to another it could be lost in transition and therefore need to be reacquired. This can impede any continuous tracking ability and complicate efforts to establish a track loop sufficient to destroy the attack.

In order for the Pentagon’s nascent Glide Phase Interceptor weapon to be effective against a hypersonic missile traveling through space at more than five times the speed of sound the missile needs to be seen. But if the weapon is traveling so fast that it transitions from one radar field to another can the tracking information be shared fast enough to enable an interceptor to “lock on” to its flight path?

Networking and processing this kind of data is the reason why the Pentagon is developing a new Hypersonic Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor technology which will establish a continuous track of fast-moving hypersonic missiles from “beyond-line-of-sight” by networking small satellites to one another and using high-speed AI-enabled computer processing to connect time-sensitive detail with ground terminals command and control centers and human operators.

“The current HBTSS satellite is a demonstration system and the communication networking link will be through the ground. The HBTSS demonstration data will downlink to the ground Command and Control and Battle Management Communication (C2BMC) which will integrate the data with other OPIR sensors” Nikki Noushkam senior manager OPIR and Geospatial Systems Northrop Grumman told The National Interest in a statement.

Some of the data processing for instance could potentially be AI-enabled and also performed at the point of data receipt when sensor data first arrives.

Computer processing is becoming much faster and a series of technical breakthroughs are allowing for incoming sensor data to be instantly analyzed organized assessed and streamlined. With this key points moments or objects of relevance can be found and sent to commanders at speeds exponentially faster than what may have previously been possible.

This means that critical data such as anticipated flight path landing time and location as well as things such as speed and altitude can be calculated by advanced computer algorithms able to bound incoming specifics off of a huge seemingly limitless database to make comparisons examine similar past scenarios and establish near real-time analytics to organize data find optimal courses of action and relay them to human decision makers through a fire-control sensor-to-shooter loop that is exponentially faster than what had previously been possible. Most of all it enables a fast exchange of information across previously disaggregated areas or “segments” of detection.

“We are very confident that the HBTSS Phase 2B demonstration satellite will launch in 2023. The acquisition plan to transition the HBTSS Fire Control tracking quality capability into an operational constellation for the warfighter is currently being assessed by the DoD” Brown added.

Space companies forced to compete with fast-moving rocket start-up SpaceX are fond of complaining about the company.

Before exiting the international launch market as a consequence of its Ukrainian war Russia used to accuse SpaceX of ""price dumping"" to win contracts that its own Roscosmos coveted. Airbus (EADSY 0.92%) subsidiary Arianespace daydreams of ""getting rid of"" low-cost SpaceX so that it doesn't have to compete on price. And here in America Blue Origin went so far as to sue the U.S. government after losing a moon lander contract to SpaceX.

But when the chips are down and a space company absolutely positively has to get a payload into space -- but can't do it on its own -- who do they call? SpaceX.

SpaceX and its frenemies

Case in point: Northrop Grumman (NOC -0.54%) is one of just two U.S. companies currently servicing the International Space Station (ISS) with periodic supply runs by rocketship -- the other company being SpaceX. When Russia's invasion of Ukraine cut off Northrop's supply of new rocket engines however the company was put in a bind. On the one hand Northrop put together a plan to have space start-up Firefly build it some alternative engines it could use to continue performing its supply contract. On the other hand those engines wouldn't be ready until late 2024 or even 2025.

So what solution did Northrop come up with? They yelped for help and asked SpaceX for a lift. In short order SpaceX -- which has built up a ready supply of ""flight proven"" used Falcon 9 rockets -- signed a contract to provide three Falcon 9 rockets to carry Northrop's Cygnus cargo vessels to ISS between 2023 and 2024.

Nor is Northrop the only competitor willing to partner with SpaceX...when there's no other choice.

Already this year Russia's reneging on a contract to launch satellites for OneWeb (itself a competitor to SpaceX's Starlink service) forced OneWeb to turn to SpaceX to provide a stopgap launch. Sanctions levied against Russia similarly deprived the European Space Agency (ESA) and its favored contractor Arianespace of access to the Soyuz rockets they had been using for medium-lift missions.

You can probably guess what happened next.

ESA's first choice for a Soyuz replacement was the Ariane 6 rocket that Arianespace is building -- but that one won't be ready until sometime next year. Casting about for an alternative ESA said it might order rocket rides from India or Japan ... or it might come to the same conclusion that so many others have come to -- that SpaceX and its low-price reusable Falcon 9 rockets are the most obvious solution to its problems.

As ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher told Reuters SpaceX is ""certainly one of the back-up launches we are looking at"" and if this is the solution ESA settles upon SpaceX could win ""a good handful of launches"" from Europe.

What it means for investors

SpaceX has come a long way since its first unsuccessful launch of a Falcon 1 rocket back in March 2006. Over the last 16 years the company has perfected its upgraded Falcon 9 design offered cut-rate launch prices introduced reusability and built up an established base of customers -- everyone from NASA and the U.S. military to U.S. and international commercial companies to SpaceX itself. (In fact eight of SpaceX's last 10 launches were missions carrying the company's own Starlink satellites to orbit).

With 39 launches under its belt this year already SpaceX is on pace to launch as many as 55 to 60 times before the calendar flips to 2023. It's launching slightly more than one rocket per week at present -- and accelerating. In fact according to owner Elon Musk the company could hit as many as 100 launches in 2023.

Yeah aiming for up to 100 flights next year -- Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 31 2022

In theory this huge base of business should help SpaceX keep its launch costs low by spreading the cost of rocket development out over a huge number of spaceflights enabling the company to keep prices low and undercut the competition. In turn these low prices should help SpaceX to win even more business -- lowering its costs even more. And now we've reached the point where these low costs are causing even SpaceX's competitors to consider using their rival's rocketships (at least when they have no other choice).

The end result of all this is that SpaceX has become the space company to beat -- and the more money SpaceX's competitors spend buying rocket rides from their rival the less money they'll have left to invest in improving their own rockets to compete with SpaceX. The end result: Northrop will still have its military business and Airbus its commercial airplanes. Neither of these companies is going away entirely. But their respective space businesses will shrivel hurting both companies' chances of profiting from future revenue growth in the space arena.

For investors the day SpaceX IPOs can't come soon enough -- because the alternatives to investing in SpaceX are only getting less and less attractive.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXRvZXZvbHV0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FsbC1hYm91dC10aGUtcnMtMjUtcm9ja2V0LWVuZ2luZXMtdGhhdC1zYWJvdGFnZWQtdGhlLWZpcnN0LWFydGVtaXMtaS1sYXVuY2gtYXR0ZW1wdC0xOTc1MjQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,All About the RS-25 Rocket Engines That Sabotaged the First Artemis I Launch Attempt,"On August 29 American space agency NASA tried to kickstart the Artemis Moon exploration program humanity’s second such effort with the launch of the first version of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and the Orion capsule. Plagued with issues the attempt ultimately failed.

Soon after tanking operations began  a hydrogen leak was discovered not unlike the ones experienced during the wet dress rehearsal tests of earlier in the year. Just like during the last such test NASA decided to push through it and declared the leak “acceptable” if there ever is such a thing in space exploration.Then a potential crack was spotted in one of the flanges connecting the fuel tanks and the core stage. Although a clear explanation for that was not really given we were told it was nothing structural so the launch was cleared to proceed.But then during the core stage’s bleed phase one of the four engines (No. 3) attached to the bottom of the rocket displayed “higher temperatures than the other engines” and the decision was made to scrub the launch.Before we set out to witness the second launch attempt scheduled for later today (2:17 p.m. EDT on Saturday September 3) we thought to give you a closer look at the engine family that was responsible for the first attempt failure.As some of you might already know the engines are called RS-25 are made by Aerojet Rocketdyne and they been used before as the main engines of the space shuttle. They’ve been tweaked of course and adapted for use on the SLS.The staged-combustion RS-25 was first used in 1979 and was flown into space for the first time two years later with space shuttle mission STS-1. It stayed in service for three decades being retired along with the spacecraft in 2011 (STS-135). During this time it was used 135 times with operational thrust levels between 100 and 104 percent and went through 5 major upgrades.The space shuttle had three such engines which burn liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen but for the SLS a configuration of four was chosen. Work on adapting them for use in the Moon rocket really started in 2015 with the first hot fire test of a new engine controller. Then in 2017 the engines were certified for flight and the combo of four meant for the SLS went through its first hot fire test in 2021. Upgraded by Northrop Grumman the engines can now operate at up to 109 percent thrust levels.Each engine is comprised of four turbopumps a main combustion chamber a nozzle and an engine controller. For the SLS Block 1 application (Artemis I) each of the four engines should be capable of generating 416300 lbs of thrust at sea level (512300 lbs in vacuum) and are slotted to burn for about eight minutes at up to 6000 degrees Fahrenheit (3315 Celsius).The four engines and the two solid boosters that accompany them should make the SLS the most powerful rocket ever capable of developing a total of 8.8 million pounds of thrust a stunning 15 percent more than the Saturn V that was the backbone of the Apollo program. Despite the huge power the rocket will be capable of lifting just 27 tons (59525 pounds) of cargo.With a proven track record the RS-25s have no reason not to work on the SLS and the issue that prevented the Artemis I launch will probably be overcome. NASA plans to use these engines for the future Artemis missions as well as it has an inventory of 16 of them leftovers from the space shuttle program.Once these are gone (the SLS is not reusable and after each launch the core stage its engines and boosters will become useless) NASA will shift to new engine currently in development over at Aerojet and slotted for delivery starting 2023."

It's Complicated,"The way Nvidia's gaming business works makes it hard to tell how important Chinese end users are.

Graphics chip company Nvidia (NVDA 1.06%) is dealing with a glut of gaming graphics cards following a multiyear period of shortages sky-high demand and soaring prices. Thankfully the company's data center business which includes high-powered graphics chips used to accelerate artificial intelligence (AI) and other number-crunching workloads is still performing well.

Nvidia already slashed its guidance to account for weak gaming demand but now the company sees a potential $400 million hit to its data center segment. On Wednesday the company disclosed that the U.S. government had imposed a new license requirement on exports to China Hong Kong and Russia of its high-powered A100 and H100 data center GPUs. The intent is to keep these ultra-powerful chips out of the hands of the Chinese military.

How important is China to Nvidia?

While the new export restrictions only affect certain data center GPUs it's worth asking how much revenue Nvidia generates from China across all its segments. Answering that question is harder than it seems. In the gaming segment Nvidia relies on its partners to assemble and sell graphics cards to end users.

In fiscal 2022 which ended on Jan. 30 Nvidia reported $7.1 billion of revenue attributable to China and Hong Kong. Another $8.5 billion of revenue was attributable to Taiwan which isn't part of these export restrictions but is nonetheless embroiled in the rising tensions between the U.S. and China. Total revenue was $26.9 billion for the year.

These numbers don't give any indication of where Nvidia's GPUs actually end up. In the gaming business Nvidia sells its chips to its board partners who then sell completed graphics cards to end users. Many of those partners are based in China and Taiwan which explains the outsized revenue contribution from those areas.

If the goal of the U.S. government is to stunt China's AI efforts it's not hard to imagine this situation getting a whole lot worse for Nvidia. The export restrictions cover only some of Nvidia's powerful data center chips but the company's gaming graphics cards are also capable of accelerating AI workloads. Of course Nvidia's gaming GPUs aren't as powerful and they're not tuned specifically for that purpose. But they're still very capable.

If export restrictions were ever applied to powerful gaming GPUs as well -- perhaps an unlikely scenario -- it would cause all sorts of problems for Nvidia. Board partners wouldn't be able to get graphics chips so it would affect sales in regions beyond China.

Should you buy on the bad news?

Nvidia stock has been slumping for nearly a year and this export news isn't helping. Shares of Nvidia were down more than 7% on Thursday as investors reacted to the escalation in trade tensions between the U.S. and China.

Is Nvidia now a bargain? I wouldn't be so sure. The semiconductor industry is cyclical and Nvidia is in the bad part of the cycle right now. There's too much supply and too little demand which means that Nvidia is being forced to slash prices to move inventory. Net income crashed 72% year over year in the second quarter.

The situation will eventually improve but there's probably no going back to the pandemic-era frenzy around graphics cards. Based on the current stock price Nvidia trades for around 40 times forward earnings. Considering that the oversupply of gaming GPUs could go on for a while and that the Chinese export situation could potentially escalate that valuation doesn't seem like a clear-cut bargain to me.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3ZpZGVvY2FyZHouY29tL25ld3ovbnZpZGlhLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwLXNlcmllcy1yZWFjaC1yZWNvcmQtbG93LXByaWNlcy1ydHgzMDkwdGktZm9yLTExMjktcnR4MzA5MC1mb3ItOTU5LTMwODB0aS1mb3ItNzM50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series reach record low prices RTX3090Ti for $1129 RTX3090 for $959 RTX3080Ti for $739,"NVIDIA RTX 30 high-end GPUs reach the lowest prices ever

Just weeks away from the announcement of new series RTX 30 cards get a massive discount.

Retailers have begun clearing the stock of high-end RTX 30 models just as NVIDIA is to announce the successor to Ampere architecture. Models that were just a few months ago were marking their highest prices now get a discount by hundreds of dollars.

The RTX 3090 series which are first to be replaced with Ada GPUs are now at $1129/$959 level for the 3090 Ti and 3090 models respectively. The flagship Ti model which had a debut just this March is likely on its way to reach half the price in the coming weeks. While RTX 3090 is struggling to sell at 1000 USD mark.

At Amazon one can easily find RTX 3090 for 959 USD while RTX 3090 it sells for 1149 USD already on Newegg or $1129 on Amazon. There were offers for $1099 but these offers are no longer available. We have recently reported that RTX 3090 Ti cards were selling for $1149 USD but only for a short time but these new prices it means we are already past the new psychological barrier.

It is also worth noting that Over at BestBuy the RTX 3080 Ti is already listed at $739 which is the record low price for this model as well.

According to MyDrivers not all cards received a price cut. It appears that recent changes only affect flagship RTX 30 series with barely any price adjustments for any other RTX 30/RX6000 model. It is clear that both NVIDIA and AMD are trying to get rid of their fastest models first in the line to be replaced in the coming weeks (October/November).

We normally do not take extra time to cover 24-bay NVMe JBOF chassis but this one is different. It uses the NVIDIA BlueField DPU. The reason for this takes a bit of historical context but it is also a successful platform worth noting.

AIC J2024-04 2U 24x NVMe SSD JBOF Powered by NVIDIA BlueField DPU

The AIC J2024-04 is a 2U 24-bay NVMe SSD JBOF. The idea of having 24x 2.5″ drive bays in a 2U chassis is well established as is just having them be a JBOF or JBOD. What is different comes down to the control nodes.

The AIC J2024-04 itself can support a number of different controller cards. There ar two controller trays for redundancy. In the version at FMS 2022 AIC had the NVIDIA BlueField DPUs installed.

One can see the management port on the tray and then the two networking cages and a USB console port on the PCIe card.

These are NVIDIA BlueField DPUs. These DPUs are the first generation cards we covered in Mellanox BlueField BF1600 and BF1700 4 Million IOPS NVMeoF Controllers before the NVIDIA acquisition of Mellanox. The older BlueField cards can have up to 16 cores (from 8 on BlueField-2) and have additional memory bandwidth. While these are ConnectX-5 based parts they were allegedly very good for storage markets before the BlueField-2 went in a more networking direction.

Although this is not the box VAST Data told us it uses AIC and BlueField as part of its solution.

Final Words

While most of the industry focus is on BlueField-2 and the transition to BlueField-3 it is interesting to remember that BlueField (1) still is a product being deployed. It was cool to see AIC bring this out to the show floor so folks could see it. Our hope is that BlueField-3 is the generation where BlueField becomes more consistent in features as BF1 to BF2 and BF2 to BF3 are fairly significant jumps.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYXMtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA5MC10aS1hbG1vc3QtbGF1bmNoZWQtYXMtdGhlLXJ0eC0zMDkwLXN1cGVyLWFzLWxlYWstcmV2ZWFscy_SAWtodHRwczovL3djY2Z0ZWNoLmNvbS9udmlkaWFzLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwOTAtdGktYWxtb3N0LWxhdW5jaGVkLWFzLXRoZS1ydHgtMzA5MC1zdXBlci1hcy1sZWFrLXJldmVhbHMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Almost Launched As The RTX 3090 SUPER As Leak Reveals,"NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3090 Ti is an interesting graphics card given the fact that it's the flagship of the lineup but there's more to its backstory than that.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 SUPER Leak Shows How The Green Team Changed Its Flagship Graphics Card At The Last Minute

The leak over at NGA.178 Forums shows an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 SUPER graphics card which has the same design and specifications as NVIDIA's flagship GeForce RTX 3090 Ti graphics card. The only major difference is the branding which we know was only used for the RTX 20 ""SUPER"" series lineup.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 SUPER Graphics Card Picture:

The user states that while the card is the same triple-slot Founders Edition behemoth that the RTX 3090 series are the design is slightly different with a metal frame with a slightly pure-black color scheme and it also has a different fan compared to the one found on the RTX 3090 Ti. The GPU-z reports the card as the RTX 3090 Ti with the same specifications of 10752 CUDA cores 1860 MHz boost speeds 24 GB GDDR6X VRAM running across a 384-bit bus at 21 Gbps for a total of 1008.4 GB/s bandwidth.

The card also has the same BIOS version as the RTX 3090 Ti Founders Edition so there's virtually no difference besides the cooler and the branding of the SUPER variant. It looks like this could be one of the early engineering samples that the user managed to acquire from the Chinese black market space which is filled with such rare hardware products. Another similar rare product is the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 20 GB which was produced in limited quantities as spotted by the user:

https://twitter.com/Zed__Wang/status/1566440608515760128

The fact that this card is titled as the NVIDIA ""GeForce RTX 3090 SUPER"" and not the ""RTX 3090 Ti"" may indicate that the green team had at some point plans to brand this card under the ""SUPER"" line considering it was their true flagship but decided to go with the ""Ti"" branding at the end. We know that the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti was amongst one of the first Ampere graphics cards to leak all the way back in 2020 and even after being finally announced at CES 2022 the card saw a big delay which pushed it back to the end of March.

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti was launched at an MSRP of $1999 US but can now be found in the retail segment for just $1099 US & will soon be under $1000 US given the price cuts that are happening in the GPU market.

The USRA B-Mods presented by BSB Manufaturing went green to checkers with USRA national points contender Gabe Hodges at the front and only challenged by his teammate Reece Solander.

Once Hodges saw the nose of Sollander's car he quickly changed lines and protected his position to take the win with Solander second and Kenton Allen nabbing third.

The USRA Modifieds brought to you by Alternative Pest Management had trouble staying green but up at the front the No. G3 of Brendon Gemmil was checking out on the field.

With “Sally” under the hood he looked good cruising into O'Reilly Auto Parts Victory Lane with Paden Phillips second and Tad Davis third.

As the regular season heads to the checkers we want to thank everyone that has helped out. We hope the lights will have some resolution soon but until then we will continue with temporary lighting. We also thank you all that attended raced or crewed. See ya at the races…

The video features the employee Sammy (@sammylocodoee) as he works behind the counter at an AutoZone location and speaks to a customer who wants to return window washer fluid. For a minute and a half Sammy and the customer are speaking in circles Sammy repeatedly explaining how AutoZone can’t accept the bottle with a cracked seal.

The customer then continually protests Sammy’s rejection claiming that he should be allowed to return the item as he ensured the fluid was at the same level as when he first purchased it.

Sammy explains that he can’t accept the return due to the store’s policy.

“I’ve shopped here for over 2 years now” the customer replies noting that he’s always been able to return items at both AutoZone and O’Reilly. “I’ve never had this issue with you.”

The worker once again explains that once the seal is broken he is unable to accept a return. “I don’t know if you used it” he says. “You could’ve poured Gatorade in it.”

The customer then demands to speak to the manager.

“I am the manager” Sammy responds before the customer then requests to speak to the district manager.

“His number is on the front door and on your way out you can read the return policy” the worker adds.

Before leaving the customer accuses Sammy of being “completely unprofessional.” The TikToker then apologizes for the inconvenience and wishes him a good day.

“Go fuck yourself” the customer responds while walking away.

According to AutoZone’s website requests for a refund can be denied if the item has been used or installed. The only way to receive a refund is to return the product within 90 days in its original packaging along with the receipt.

The video has amassed 1.1 million views as of Sunday. Many people in the comments sided with Sammy and commended him on his professionalism in dealing with the “Karen.”

“‘This is completely unprofessional you know that?’ This is one of the most professional exchanges i’ve ever seen” one user complimented.

“You were very respectful too” a second said.

“‘I am the manager’ that made me so happy. You weren’t rude. You didn’t get scared. Good for you!” a third wrote.

Additionally several others claiming to be O’Reilly Auto Parts employees said they also don’t accept open containers.

“As an O’Reilly employee if it’s cracked we don’t return it as well” one user confirmed.

“I do the same at O’Reillys. Seal broken no returns. Electrical part installed can’t return” a second concurred.

The Daily Dot reached out to Sammy via TikTok comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hemNlbnRyYWwuY29tL3BpY3R1cmUtZ2FsbGVyeS9tb25leS9idXNpbmVzcy9qb2JzLzIwMjIvMDkvMDQvYXJpem9uYS1yZXB1YmxpYy0xMDAtc3RhdGVzLWxhcmdlc3QtZW1wbG95ZXJzLTIwMTkvMTAzNTQyMTgwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arizona Republic 100: State's largest employers in 2022,"JOBS

According to Burlington County prosecutors a preliminary investigation has found that Peter Lestician's body was discovered on Friday by two men riding four-wheelers along an ATV trail in Clearfield County Pennsylvania.

PA State Police were called to an abandoned barn in Cooper Township around 4 p.m. and found his body in the front seat of a locked vehicle.

PA State Police listed Lestician's death as a suicide.

Lestician 53 was a person of interest in the death of his longtime girlfriend Sheila Maguire 54 who was found dead in her Florence home on Monday. While authorities say he was possibly the last person to see Maguire alive no charges had been filed against Lestician and prosecutors say there is no direct evidence linking him to the homicide.

Investigators say they are working with the district attorney's office in Pennsylvania to gain permission to search the vehicle and confirm the body's identity. The Burlington County Prosecutor's Office says it will continue to investigate Maguire's homicide.

An autopsy found that Maguire was killed by blunt force trauma to her head at her home on Birch Hollow Drive prosecutors say. Maguire and Lestician lived together at the home. Maguire's daughters requested police to make a wellness check at the home Monday after not hearing from their mother for several days according to prosecutors.

Previous reports said that Lestician had not been seen since last weekend. Prosecutors confirmed that he had not made contact with any family members since Aug. 26.

Maguire's social media posts say that the couple met around eight years ago when Lestician was a coach for her daughter's softball team. He led Hightstown High School to its first state title in his second year as coach and was named NJ.com's Softball Coach of the Year in 2019.

At least according to the three-part docuseries “House of Hammer” that syndrome goes back three or four generations earlier to the disgraced movie actor. Form following subject the Discovery+ program is a sleazy wallow dressed up with some undeniably worthwhile elements.

Come for the behind-the-scenes historical context and instruction on spotting red flags from hot guys who want to tie up women against their will; stay for the debauchery high-level business and political chicanery and privileged family dysfunction which main talking head Casey Hammer (Armie’s aunt) compares to “Succession” but magnified a million times.

Directed by doc veterans Elli Hakami and Julian P. Hobbs (“Red Elvis” “Queen of Meth”) “House of Hammer” boils over with ominous music cues and cheesy vague-so-not-actionable dramatic re-enactments.

The first episode charts Hammer’s fall from Hollywood grace when texts about his sadistic wishes became public followed by more serious allegations of battery and rape that are still under investigation. It’s laid out to maximum yuck effect with slices of TikTokers acting shocked shocked (read: delighted) to discover the dark side of the handsome stud from “The Social Network” and “Call Me by Your Name.”

Yet when some of Hammer’s girlfriends especially Dallas entrepreneur Courtney Vucekovich go into emotional — if sometimes evasive — detail of how he love-bombed then Shibari-roped them into submission their pain and vulnerability is heartbreaking. While Armie Hammer’s die-hard defenders may question the victims’ trauma or even veracity their voices faces and body language here tell tales that leave no doubt.

Maybe a little more skepticism is in order for Aunt Casey. She’s written a book “Surviving My Birthright” and seems determined to be the Hammer family’s Mary Trump. Casey steers the show’s drive to expose how awful her grandfather Armand Hammer father Julian Hammer and brother Michael Hammer (Armie’s dad) really were.

A few legit journalists and a former Occidental Petroleum publicist recount with authority how Armand the oil company’s boss manipulated international leaders to build his fortune and later his A-list philanthropist image. He was also bad to women and probably a Soviet spy they claim.

Casey’s strongest recollections are of her dissolute gun-waving and wife-beating dad Julian. When Armand skipped him over to leave corporate control and most of his money to Michael — a wild party boy who after marrying Armie’s devout Christian mother may or may not have come to Jesus himself — Casey was cut out too. To this day Michael claims she’s besmirching the family with lies. We know where “House of Hammer” stands on the issue; viewers will more likely wonder who’s telling the closest facsimile to the truth.

Armie and Michael declined to participate in the documentary a closing crawl reads. One strong angle addressed in the third episode is how the media has framed the actor’s scandal in terms of its effect on his career rather than the damage wrought by the physical and mental abuse he’s accused of committing. Reporters love that kooky cannibal fetish though which we can’t hype enough.

A few clear-eyed observers such as feminist attorney Gloria Allred and professional dominatrix Damiana Chi make valuable points like how kink is legal and grounded in consent without which it becomes something criminal and demented.

“House of Hammer” of course accentuates the demented. It’s here to titillate then evoke disgust. Some enlightenment may be conveyed in that process but perceive it or not you’re mostly gonna feel manhandled.

""House of Hammer"" premiered Friday and details the family's history of scandals.

The 24-year-old content creator referred to the fallout from dating the actor as ""traumatic.""

Armie Hammer's ex-girlfriend Paige Lorenze says she didn't want to take part in a docuseries about the actor's alleged abuse and his family's controversial history.

In an interview on the podcast ""Sofia with an F"" the 24-year-old content creator said she refused to be involved in the project because ""the situation was traumatic.""

During the episode Lorenze said she was love-bombed and manipulated by the 36-year-old. She recalled telling her family how the actor had treated her to which her sister responded ""that's not safe.""

Lorenze previously claimed her former ex-boyfriend used a knife to carve his initial into her skin and asked her to remove her ribs so he could eat them.

The Discovery+ docuseries ""House of Hammer"" premiered Friday and features two of Hammer's exes who share messages they claim were from the actor including one that read ""I am 100% a cannibal"" and ""I want to eat you.""

In 2021 an anonymous Instagram account @houseofeffie posted unverified DMs from the actor claiming he had a cannibalism fetish. The woman behind the account identified herself as Effie and accused Hammer of raping her in 2017.

The allegations prompted a sexual assault investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department.

On Thursday Greg Risling a spokesperson for the LA County district's attorney's office told the Los Angeles Times that a ""specially assigned prosecutor"" is working with law enforcement on the case.

Speaking with Vanity Fair in March 2021 Lorenze said she ended their four-month-long relationship because ""you never know what you're going to get with him — he's kind of a scary person.""

Hammer has maintained that all of his sexual encounters have been consensual and has denied allegations of abuse against him.

The docuseries also details abuse allegedly carried out by the men in the Hammer family. Hammer's aunt Casey Hammer told Insider she was not surprised to learn her nephew had been accused of sexual assault.

She alleged that her grandfather — the billionaire CEO oil tycoon of Occidental Petroleum Armand Hammer — her father and her brother were all sexually physically and mentally abusive.

""You don't just wake up one day and become a monster"" she said. ""It's a learned behavior and again that's why I wasn't shocked by a lot of what was happening.

Hammer is best known for his roles in films like ""The Social Network"" and ""Call Me By Your Name.""

Paige Lorenze and Armie Hammer's lawyer Andrew Brettler did not respond to Insider's request for comment.

Following the shocking allegations against Armie Hammer many details of his life including his family life have come into the public eye. The Hammer family has a long history in the business world and has accrued a fortune over the years. Armie and his family are the subjects of the new documentary House of Hammer which premiered on Discovery Plus on Sept. 2 2022. The question remains: what is the Hammer family's net worth?

What is the Hammer family net worth?

In a 2021 exposé on the Hammer family from Vanity Fair writer Julie Miller dives deep into the Hammer family history. In 1919 Armie's great-great-grandfather Dr. Julius Hammer performed an abortion on the wife of a Russian diplomat. Julius was a Russian immigrant living in the Bronx and following the death of his patient was sentenced to 3.5-12 years in Sing Sing.

During the time Julius was in prison his son Armand Hammer Armie's namesake abandoned the family medical practice and invested in his father's side business Allied Drug. Armand eventually moved to the Soviet Union to be closer to family and entered his first of many marriages. His only son Julian was Armie's grandfather.

The Hammer family eventually moved to Los Angeles at which point Armand was on his third marriage to a wealthy woman named Frances Barrett Tolman. He convinced her to invest her wealth into then-failing Occidental Petroleum which skyrocketed the company to success. Following his swift journey to riches Armand distanced himself from his Soviet roots and marketed himself as a ""self-made industrialist.""

The House of Hammer documentary similar to Vanity Fair has testimony from Casey Hammer Armie's aunt and an estranged member of the family. She told Vanity Fair that her grandfather was deeply controlling saying ""God forbid you did anything wrong in front of his friends. You couldn’t wear the same dress twice to his gala parties. On the outside we had to be the perfect family."" She also noted that he required all members of the family to make appointments to see him.

Although Julian Hammer was noted as ""bright"" Armand didn't seem to care for him much and upon his death in 1990 left the majority of his business empire to Armie's father Michael instead. Julian was notoriously wild and in 1955 was even arrested for murdering a man over gambling debts. Armand reportedly sent $50000 in cash to clear up the matter to a lawyer in LA and the charges were dropped.

Per Vanity Fair when Armand died in 1990 his estimated net worth was around $180 million. A battle for Armand's estate ensued but when the family consulted with lawyers it was revealed that they had been left $40 million. Armand cut Julian his only son out of his will altogether and also made a note that his step-granddaughter Jan did not receive a penny.

Today the Hammer family's estimated wealth due to a steady stream of bad investments and profitable ones is unknown. According to All Famous Birthday Michael the family's current patriarch is estimated to have a net worth of $1.5 million. Armie's previously estimated net worth has since fallen due to his decline in fame.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL2VuZ2xpc2guZWxwYWlzLmNvbS9zb2NpZXR5LzIwMjItMDktMDMvbmV3LWRvY3VzZXJpZXMtZXhwbG9yZXMtYXJtaWUtaGFtbWVycy1saWZlLWFuZC1mYW1pbHktcmFwZS1hbGxlZ2F0aW9ucy1hcmUtanVzdC10aGUtdGlwLW9mLXRoZS1pY2ViZXJnLmh0bWzSAagBaHR0cHM6Ly9lbmdsaXNoLmVscGFpcy5jb20vc29jaWV0eS8yMDIyLTA5LTAzL25ldy1kb2N1c2VyaWVzLWV4cGxvcmVzLWFybWllLWhhbW1lcnMtbGlmZS1hbmQtZmFtaWx5LXJhcGUtYWxsZWdhdGlvbnMtYXJlLWp1c3QtdGhlLXRpcC1vZi10aGUtaWNlYmVyZy5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New docuseries explores Armie Hammer’s life and family: ‘Rape allegations are just the tip of the iceberg’,"The rumors started as jokes. In January 2021 an anonymous Instagram account posted messages that actor Armie Hammer 36 the then-unstoppable star of Call Me By Your Name (2017) Operation U.N.C.L.E (2016) and The Lone Ranger (2010) had allegedly sent. These messages had been sent to different women; in them the actor seemed to exhibit a wide range of sexual fetishes related to cannibalism bondage and violence. “I am 100% a cannibal…. Fuck. That’s scary to admit. I’ve never admitted that before. I’ve cut the heart out of a living animal before and eaten it while still warm” one read. “If I fucked you into a vegetative state I’d keep you feed you and keep fucking you” promised another. At first the text messages were seen as bizarre texts of questionable authenticity. Some defended Hammer against what appeared to be kink shaming (mocking someone for their unusual sexual preferences) on the assumption that he was being humiliated for having expressed intimate fantasies that were not necessarily linked to real criminal behavior.

Events took another turn on January 14 when the actor’s former girlfriend Courtney Vucekovich told the gossip website Page Six about her “not only weird and gross but emotionally abusive” experiences with Hammer (the article’s headline was “He wanted to barbecue and eat me”). Vucekovich alleged that she had not consented to the sadomasochistic practices in which they engaged.

Vucekovich explained it this way: “He kind of captivates you and while being charming he’s grooming you for these things that are darker and heavier and consuming. When I say consuming I mean mentally physically emotionally financially just everything.” She went on to note that “he did some things with me that I wasn’t comfortable with. For God knows what reason he convinced me that these things were OK and he put me in some dangerous situations where I was not OK where he was heavily drinking and I wasn’t drinking that way and it scared me. I didn’t feel comfortable.” As a result Vucekovich said she’d suffered panic attacks and needed therapy after her relationship with Hammer. Her statements highlighted the actor’s “obsessive” character and manipulative nature.

After seeing Hammer’s text messages another woman Paige Lorenze also decided to go on the record about the star whom she knew well. She saw a pattern of behavior mentioned in the messages that resembled what she said the star had done with her. “The scariest part of it is that I did love him in a way. I would’ve let him kind of do anything. He had a certain hold over me” she told E! News.

Through his representatives Hammer has categorically denied the veracity of the messages. Nonetheless the scandal has forced the actor out of all the projects in which he’d planned to participate. Filmed in 2019 and released in 2022 after numerous postponements Death on the Nile was the last film in which he appeared; he was conspicuously absent from efforts to promote the film including the movie poster. When he was last spotted Hammer was working as a timeshare salesman near a hotel in the Cayman Islands where his children and ex-wife also live. According to Variety the actor also completed a stint at a rehab facility to treat his various addictions.

During all this time Hammer has been keeping a low profile perhaps hoping that the storm will die down soon. However the premiere of House of Hammer – the three-part docuseries about his family’s history that premieres this Friday September 2 on Discovery+ – is poised to thwart that strategy.

The documentary features the accounts of several of the star’s alleged victims and they provide previously unpublished documents including voice messages (“My bet was going to involve showing up at your place completely tying you up and incapacitating you and then being able to do whatever I wanted in every single hole in your body until I was done with you” Armie says in one message). The actor’s aunt Casey Hammer is also participating in the show. She severed ties with her relatives years ago and in 2015 published an explosive autobiography Surviving My Birthright. In her book she alleged that her father Julian Hammer (Armie’s grandfather) had sexually abused her and other family members when she was a child a revelation that she’s expected to discuss further in the docuseries.

“The accusations of rape and abuse brought against Armie Hammer in the last few years are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the Hammer family. With House of Hammer we witness truly disturbing details and sinister secrets that money and power couldn’t hide forever” promises Jason Sarlanis Discovery+ president of crime and investigative content.

Five generations of power privilege and violence

When Armie Hammer took off in Hollywood with his portrayal of the Winklevoss twins in The Social Network (2010) he was already a wealthy man. The actor comes from a family of millionaire oil tycoons Soviet maneuverers and art dealers. His great-great-grandfather Dr. Julius Hammer was a Russian immigrant to the United States. He was sentenced to between three and 12 years in prison for involuntary manslaughter after performing an abortion on a Russian diplomat’s wife in 1919. The jury found that Julius had left his patient to “die like a dog.” To cover up the crime he blamed her death on the Spanish flu pandemic raging at the time.

With Julius in prison his son Armand Hammer took control of his company Allied Drug & Chemical; perhaps as Edward Jay Epstein’s 1996 book Dossier: The Secret History of Armand Hammer contends this occurred with the support of Lenin and Stalin. In the unauthorized biography Epstein quotes one of Armand’s former wives who claims that Armand was really responsible for the abortion that ended in murder and landed his father in prison. Julius merely took the blame.

Armand increased the family fortune through the Occidental Petroleum oil company which he ran from 1957 until his death. According to Epstein Armand laundered money used his role as an art dealer to finance Soviet espionage and facilitated illegal contributions to Richard Nixon’s campaign which “in all likelihood went to pay for the Watergate cover-up.” The biographer notes that Armand forced one of his mistresses to change her name and wear disguises after his wife found out about the affair. The mistress also agreed to “extremely humiliating” sexual requests based on his promise to take care of her family. In the end though he left her out of his will. As Armand’s ex-wife pointed out “[it] causes him no pain to see the sufferings of others.”

Armand had a son Julian Armie’s grandfather. Because of his “unstable behavior” Julian did not inherit control of the oil empire. Besides his daughter Casey’s accusations of sexual abuse in 1955 early in the morning on his 26th birthday he was accused of murdering a man in his home over an alleged gambling debt. He never did any jail time; the judge found that Julian had acted in self-defense.

Michael Hammer – Armie’s father Julian’s son and the heir to Armand’s business – further built the family fortune. He settled his family in the Cayman Islands and renounced his US citizenship. Michael concentrated on his strict Christian religion while also selling forged Rothko and Pollock paintings a scandal that led to the closure of his art gallery in 2011. According to a 2021 Vanity Fair report that quoted Michael’s close friends the businessman owns a “sex throne” – a huge chair with a hole in the seat a cage and a hook.

Despite Armie Hammer’s disappearance from public life the police are no longer investigating him. In December 2021 the probe into the initial rape accusation ended because of insufficient evidence."
ODFL,Old Dominion,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vb2R1c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDkvMDMvb2R1LWZvb3RiYWxsLXRlYW0tcmFsbGllcy1pbi10aGUtZmluYWwtdGhyZWUtbWludXRlcy10by10b3AtdmlyZ2luaWEtdGVjaC0yMC0xN9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ODU Football Team Rallies in the Final Three Minutes to Top Virginia Tech 20-17,"By Harry Minium



NORFOLK Va. – Lightning does strike twice.



Quarterback Hayden Wolff engineered a dramatic Old Dominion rally in the final three minutes leading the Monarchs on a 74-yard touchdown drive that gave ODU a 20-17 victory over Virginia Tech.



The victory comes four years after the Monarchs upended the Hokies 49-35 at old Foreman Field in the biggest victory in ODU football history.



That victory was ODU's first over a Power 5 school and Tech was ranked 13th nationally. This Tech team is rebuilding and ODU has a veteran team. The Hokies were only 6-point favorites whereas they were 29-point favorites four years ago.



But beating a program that has won four ACC titles has the largest following in the state and played for a national championship was the most consequential victory in coach Ricky Rahne's tenure at ODU.



The game was witnessed by a sellout crowd of 21944 the largest since 2019 at S.B. Ballard Stadium and the crowd was electric. At game's end most of the nearly 5000 ODU students in attendance charged the field and celebrated with the players.



""That's what college football is all about right there"" said Rahne ODU's Thurmond Family Head Coach. He dripping wet from a Gatorade bath he received at game's end.



""Monarch nation came out and supported us tonight in a big way. The entire Hampton Roads area came out and supported us.



""This was an awesome atmosphere. I told our guys to go out and soak it up. This was a special night. I know a lot of these kids are never going to forget it.""



The game matched programs with close ties. Rahne and first-year Tech coach Brent Pry were both coordinators at Penn State and nearly two dozen members of both staffs worked together at Penn State or other schools.







Jen Rahne and Amy Pry wives of the head coaches tailgated just outside S.B. Ballard Stadium along with Fumi Franklin wife of Penn State coach James Franklin.



The game was the place to see and be seen. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin a Norfolk native; and Attorney General Jason Miyares who is from Virginia Beach both attended. It was ODU's first game as a member of the Sun Belt Conference and Sun Belt Commissioner Keith Gill participated in pregame activities.



Washington Commanders quarterback Taylor Heinicke the best player in ODU history was on the ODU sideline as were former Tech All-Americans and NFL stars Bruce Smith and Michael Vick. Blake LaRussa the former walk-on quarterback who engineered ODU's 2018 victory was there along with a number of his former teammates.



The game itself wasn't artful. Tech quarterback Grant Wells had four passes intercepted and ODU scored its first touchdown when a Hokie long snapper hiked an attempted field goal over the head of the holder.



The ball bounded 56 yards to the Tech 25 where cornerback Robert Kennedy III scooped it up and ran for the touchdown.







ODU had just 245 offensive yards and half came in the fourth quarter while Virginia Tech had 14 penalties.



""There were plays available all night and we just didn't make them"" Rahne said. ""That's fine. That happens sometimes. But at the end Hayden Wolff made some huge plays.""



Tech led 17-10 when the Monarchs had only their second sustained drive of the game marching from the Tech 48 to the 3 before settling for an Ethan Sanchez 20-yard field goal the second of the game for the freshman from Dallas Georgia.



Wolff completed a 27-yard pass to Ali Jennings III on the big play of that drive to foreshadow what would be a dramatic end to the game.



Tech was milking the clock and driving into ODU territory when linebacker Ryan Henry intercepted a Wells pass at the ODU 41. A personal foul drove the ball back to the 26 and with 2:58 to go the Monarchs had to score a touchdown to win.



Wolff found Jennings for 24 yards on the first play and the crowd was on its feet the rest of the game.



On third and six Wolff took off out of the pocket and was drilled by a Tech linebacker a yard short of the first down.







Initially refs ruled that he fumbled but when the replay was shown on the TowneBank Scoreboard the crowd cheered because they knew he was down before he fumbled.



Facing fourth and 1 offensive coordinator Kevin Reihner called on senior running back Blake Watson to get the first down and he bulled past a linebacker to keep the drive alive.



Watson's stats – 19 carries for 56 yards and a touchdown – weren't spectacular but most of his yards came as he dragged Hokies with him.



On third and 7 from the 39 Wolff found Jennings on the left side of the field a yard short of a touchdown with a minute left to play.



ODU then milked the clock forcing Tech to burn two timeouts before Watson carried for the touchdown on second down.



Tech had 37 seconds left to get into field goal range but LaMareon James the sophomore from Indian River High School intercepted Wells on third down to clinch the victory.



Wolff said that this victory was different than the 2018 win in which he celebrated on the field with students while on recruiting trip to ODU.



""It was a big win"" he said. ""A lot of people are talking about how we shocked the world that this was a big surprise.



""We don't see it like that. We know what we went through during the offseason what we're capable of. We expected to win this game. We full heartedly believed that and went out and got it done.







""I know they're a Power 5 school but we're a program on the rise.""



The defense Wolff said won the game.



""Grant Wells is a great quarterback and our defense intercepted him four times"" he said. ""They gave us a chance to win.""



Rahne paid tribute to Reihner for orchestrating the final drive.



At 30 he is among the nation's youngest offensive coordinators.



""For coach Rehiner to be able to find what was going to work on that last drive that's pretty awesome"" Rahne said.



Rahne acknowledged that ""I know people may not think it was a beautiful game.""



""But"" he added ""I've never experienced an ugly victory.""

Old Dominion fans stormed the field to celebrate their second win over a Power 5 team. The first also came against the Hokies in 2018 a 49-35 victory.

This was not exactly the way first-year Virginia Tech head coach Brent Pry wanted to start the season. The Hokies had five turnovers leading to 17 Old Dominion points. The most crucial came with 2:58 remaining in the game. Leading 17-13 quarterback Grant Wells threw an interception that set up the game-winning score a 1-yard touchdown run from Blake Watson with 33 seconds remaining.

The Hokies also committed 15 penalties for 121 yards. Wells starting his first game for Virginia Tech threw four interceptions and went 21-of-36 for 197 yards with a touchdown.

""They wanted to make plays they wanted to play hard but I definitely think they pressed and were sloppy"" Pry said. ""You want to make people earn it and we didn't do that.""

Added linebacker Dax Hollifield: ""It's embarrassing. Very embarrassing.""

Playing road games against the Group of 5 has not worked out particularly well for ACC teams that end up scheduling them. With this loss the league now has 20 road losses against Group of 5 teams in the College Football Playoff era.

The game was a slog right from the outset as neither offense could find much rhythm. Old Dominion led 10-7 at halftime. Then the start of the second half was delayed 15 minutes because members of the Virginia Tech coaching staff got stuck between floors on an elevator. Eventually the coaches were able to get off the elevator but they had to run up the six flights of stairs up to the coaches box.

That might be a good metaphor for what unfolded in the second half. But this is not the last time the schools will see each other. They are currently scheduled to play every year through 2031 with four of those games at Old Dominion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd0a3IuY29tL25ld3MvaG9zcGl0YWwtbG9ja2Rvd24tbGlmdGVkLWFmdGVyLTctc2hvdC1pbi1ub3Jmb2xrLW1hc3Mtc2hvb3Rpbmctb3RoZXItaW5jaWRlbnRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2 dead 5 hurt in Norfolk mass shooting on Killam Ave.,"NORFOLK Va. - Norfolk police say two are dead and five others injured following a mass shooting in the Highland Park section of the city near Old Dominion University.

According to police officers were called to a home on Killam Ave. near 50th St. around midnight Sunday for a shooting. Police say when officers arrived they located four women and three men with gunshot wounds.

#NorfolkPD is currently investigating a shooting in the 5000 block of Killam Avenue. 7 people have been taken to the hospital (5 have non-life threatening injuries 2 have life threatening injuries) Call came in around 12:00 a.m. More details to follow. pic.twitter.com/rTnL4e4YEF — Norfolk Police Dept (@NorfolkPD) September 4 2022

Of the victims police said two a man and a woman had life-threatening injuries. Around 12:30 p.m. investigators revealed 25-year-old Zabre Miller and 19-year-old Angelia McKnight had died from their injuries.

Sunday morning Norfolk State University said several of the shooting victims were NSU students.

""Initial indications are that our students were innocent bystanders of a shooting at an evening house party"" the university posted to its Instagram page adding that although NSU's police had secured the university's campus there was no danger to campus.

Sunday afternoon NSU President Javaune Adams-Gaston confirmed McKnight a New York native was a Pre-Nursing student in her second year at the university.

""Our prayers and condolences are with Angelia's family and all those impacted by this tragic event"" Adams-Gaston said in a statement adding that counseling and support services have been made available on campus.

A spokesperson with Old Dominion tells News 3 that none of the victims were ODU students.

Norfolk emergency dispatch radio traffic also indicated emergency crews responded to several other shooting incidents around the city overnight. News 3 cameras located active police scenes at 18th Bay St. and Pleasant Ave. and the intersection of N. Military Hwy and Brickell Rd. There was also a call out for a shooting at Nicholson Street in Young Terrace just after midnight.

Police said someone was hurt in the 18th Bay Street shooting and said the incident on N. Military Hwy is a homicide.

On Sunday afternoon Mayor Kenny Alexander interim Police Chief Mike Goldsmith City Manager Chip Filer and Sheriff Joe Baron addressed the violence.

""Violence has no place in the City of Norfolk"" said Alexander.

Filer put it frankly and said he would be working to try and identify additional strategies the city could take to try and prevent the gun violence. ""We've tried a number of initiatives. We've tried a number of efforts all of which seem to not be getting us where we need to be"" said Filer.

Goldsmith says they have shifted strategies to put more officers on patrol and identified the problem as people handling conflicts by shooting at each other. ""This is what's frustrating about these things - right now people get into a disagreement and then they shoot each other"" said Goldsmith. ""In the process of doing that they end up shooting innocent people who end up dying. That cannot be tolerated.""

Even though the police department has more than 200 vacancies the chief doesn't attribute that as leading to violence.

""If somebody gets angry at someone and decides to pull out a gun and shoot them there's no policing strategy for that. If we had a department of 1200 there's no policing strategy for that"" said Goldsmith.

Still the problem isn't going away. Filer says in the last six years the poverty rate has decreased in the city and the median income has gone up but so has crime.

""I think all of us are trying to figure out where that's coming from"" he said. ""As the mayor said so perfectly where do we go from here?""

A spokesperson for Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin sent News 3 a statement Sunday in response to the shooting reading:

""The governor is devastated to learn that two individuals lost their lives and prays for a full recovery for the students and victims impacted by this devastating shooting. As more details are uncovered the Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security Bob Mosier and the Virginia State Police are coordinating with and offering assistance to local authorities.""

Early Sunday morning a police source told News 3 that Sentara Norfolk General Hospital's Trauma Center was locked down as a result of the violence and number of patients. Emergency dispatch radio traffic indicated other patients were temporarily diverted to other hospitals for treatment. Around 5 a.m. a hospital spokesperson said the lockdown had been lifted and normal operations had resumed.

Hemphill Ph.D. announced plans for a School of Data Science and an expanded baseball facility during his first State of the University address which he delivered Friday at Chartway Arena.

The University is in the final stages of submitting a proposal to the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia regarding the School of Data Science he said.

Through partnerships with Jefferson Lab and NASA Langley researchers from these national labs will have ODU faculty status. Also ODU faculty and students will have special access to these national lab collaborations and facilities.

""This is truly a win-win for ODU and our partners"" President Hemphill said.

The baseball stadium project exists thanks to the generosity of several donors including Priority Automotive President and CEO Dennis Ellmer who gave $2.5 million.

""ODU is honored that the expanded facility will be known as the Ellmer Family Baseball Complex"" President Hemphill said. (See related story.)

In a further announcement the ODU leader said the University was in the first phase of a multiyear effort to increase stipend levels for graduate assistants. Master's students with teaching assistant duties will receive $15000 - a boost of $5000 - to support the institution's mission of teaching as well as research.

Stipends for doctoral students will increase from $15000 to $20000 effective immediately President Hemphill said.

Among other achievements he highlighted from the past year was ODU's designation in December 2021 as an R1 research university by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. This placed ODU among the nation's top research institutions.

""This is a truly significant accomplishment and will forever change the future possibilities for our institution and our students"" President Hemphill said.

But his vision is grander still.

""We are truly committed to moving up among our R1 counterparts with a bold and aggressive agenda across all research areas with a special emphasis on maritime coastal resiliency offshore wind energy data science cybersecurity autonomous systems and health care.""

On the health care front President Hemphill cited the University's expanded work with Eastern Virginia Medical School and a deepening collaboration with Sentara Healthcare and other partners. Since the summer of 2021 the entities have been meeting to explore the establishment of an academic health sciences center to address health disparities facing the region and its people President Hemphill said.

""A strategic integration between EVMS and ODU would result in an academic health sciences center that offers the highest number of academic programs and the largest enrollment in health sciences in the Commonwealth of Virginia"" he said.

The proposed integration would strengthen and increase the workforce pipeline in Hampton Roads he said creating an economic impact of $4.9 billion for Virginia.

Highlighting other initiatives in progress President Hemphill updated the audience on construction of what he called ""state-of-the-art facilities that create a learning environment that is second to none.""

The Health Sciences Building a capital project of more than $76 million is taking shape at 41st Street and Monarch Way and is scheduled to be finished in summer 2023. The three-story building will house the School of Dental Hygiene the School of Rehabilitation Sciences and the School of Medical Diagnostic and Translational Sciences.

During the most recent legislative session the University secured $188 million in project funding for a new Biology Building. With more than 160000 square feet across five floors it is scheduled to be ready in 2026 replacing the Mills Godwin Life Sciences Building.

Regarding athletics President Hemphill spoke about the ""new era"" Old Dominion entered in July of this year when it joined the Sun Belt Conference.

""For ODU the conference movement was always about providing the very best experience for our student-athletes as well as our fans"" he said. ""We are honored to join the Sun Belt and look forward to a great deal of collaboration and competition in our inaugural season and beyond.""

President Hemphill also:

Acknowledged nearly 300 students faculty and staff for serving on 12 groups that crafted a five-year strategic plan for the University. The final plan will go to the Board of Visitors in December he said.

Congratulated ODU's Virginia Modeling Analysis and Simulation Center for 25 years as an academic center of excellence in modeling and simulation to support critical research related to the U.S. Department of Defense.

Cited the School of Cybersecurity for its recent designation as a National Security Agency Center for Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense.

Praised 13 cybersecurity students being inducted into ODU's Cyber LeADERS program.

Applauded the work of two task forces: ODU Online and Branding Marketing and Communication. Their recommendations he said will come to life under the leadership of two vice presidents Nina Rodriguez Gonser in Digital Learning and Jaime Hunt in University Communications.

We’d call it an upset but is it really at this point?

Now that’s not to say Virginia Tech fans shouldn’t be excited about Pry and the 2022 Hokies. Former head coach Justin Fuente left a barren roster and broken recruiting relationships throughout the state both of which will take time to rebuild.

For a while on Friday it looked like the Hokies may cruise to a win. Tech jumped out to a 7-0 lead on its second possession of the game after quarterback Grant Wells connected with wide receiver Kaleb Smith on a 40-yard play before calling his own number and scoring from 18 yards out just two plays later.

Virginia Tech would lead for much of the game until Old Dominion’s go-ahead touchdown with around 30 seconds remaining.

Despite mistake after mistake the Hokies should’ve still won this game. Let’s explain why.

Here are our five takeaways from Friday’s game.

Bad snap changed the game

The Hokies had an opportunity to go up 10-3 in the second quarter but a high snap through the hands of holder Peter Moore saw the ball going in the wrong direction. Moore tried to fall on the ball but pushed it further downfield when ODU defensive back Robert Kennedy III picked up the loose ball and ran it in for a touchdown and suddenly the Monarchs were up 10-7.

That’s a 10-point swing that went against the Hokies. Instead of a seven-point lead Virginia Tech was down three points. ODU’s offense was lifeless at this point. Quarterback Hayden Wolff looked like he didn’t belong on the field while Tech’s defense clamped down on Old Dominion’s top three playmakers in running back Blake Watson wide receiver Ali Jennings and tight end Zack Kuntz.

What would’ve happened if ODU had never scored on this mistake? So many mistakes in one play. A bad snap and then the Hokies couldn’t simply fall on the football.

Speaking of mistakes......

Penalties and turnovers

When you turn the ball over five times and commit 14 penalties for 100 yards you aren’t going to beat anyone. It’s understandable for a new coaching staff with new players to struggle in the opening game. However 14 penalties are inexcusable. How many procedural penalties did the Hokies commit Friday?

Wells and the offense often faced third and long situations. A big reason for that was penalties. And when you are facing 3rd-and-11 repeatedly the defense can drop eight and make the quarterback impatient. That’s what happened.

Wells had four interceptions a problem that followed him from Marshall. Wells has a terrific arm and he can run but he fits that gunslinger type to a tee. And that’s not always a good thing. Wells’ first two interceptions were the result of either a terrible decision or throw. His third interception — the one that led to ODU’s final touchdown — bounced off the hands of a teammate into the waiting arms of an Old Dominion defender.

While that wasn’t wholly on Wells he probably should’ve run it or tossed it out of bounds instead of throwing it into traffic. Quarterbacks need to consider the situation they are in at the time. Virginia Tech was facing third and long but in ODU territory. Had Wells just thrown it out of bounds the Hokies had a chance to pin the Monarchs deep and perhaps the end result would’ve been different.

Wells did some good things but those turnovers overshadow everything positive.

Questionable decisions

When ODU had a first-and-goal with 1:07 remaining why did Pry wait until there were 41 seconds left to call timeout? A timeout there could’ve given Virginia Tech’s offense at least 45 seconds on offense — plenty of time to get into field-goal range.

Another questionable decision involved the personnel. Where was Connor Blumrick all game long? We heard all offseason how he was one of Tech’s top 22 overall players and he would a lot. And he’s not targeted until Virginia Tech’s hail mary drive? He made an outstanding catch on the sideline but was pushed out of bounds.

Blumrick could be a valuable offensive piece for the Hokies. Why not get him involved sooner? The threat of Blumrick on the field is enough to create headaches for the defense because he can run or pass.

Missed opportunity

Another play that stands out happened on Old Dominion’s final drive. Wolff scrambled for around eight yards when Virginia Tech safety Jalen Stroman hit him jarring the football loose. The Hokies recovered. However the play was overturned via replay. It was the correct call.

So on the next play the Monarchs faced a 4th-and-1. The Hokies guessed right as Wolff handed off to Watson and multiple Tech defenders swarmed the backfield. Somehow Watson escapes and gains around three yards for a first down. Had the Hokies finished this play the game is over.

Just really poor execution from a defense that played well until late.

A positive: Nowhere to go but up

This loss feels like rock bottom. We’ve had several losses that feel like rock bottom in recent years. Even though this one hurts there are reasons to be positive. After all this is Pry and his coaching staff’s first game. And many of the mistakes that plagued VT are correctable. How often are the Hokies going to turn the ball over five times? How often will Virginia Tech commit 15 penalties? Will the long snapper continue to struggle? All of these things are fixable.

The Hokies didn’t lose on talent Friday night. They truly beat themselves over and over. Give credit to Old Dominion as the Monarchs took advantage of every opportunity they were given. Every ODU point came off a Virginia Tech turnover.

As stated earlier Wells did some good things. His arm talent gives the Hokies something they lacked in recent years. And Wells is tough. How many times did he hang in the pocket and make a throw knowing he was going to get hit? However the turnovers cannot continue. Unlike previous seasons the Hokies have a capable backup in Jason Brown who can win games. While Brown may present the dynamic big-play ability of Wells he’s a steady veteran who will take care of the football.

It was nice seeing Wells read through his progressions. Remember when we were told the previous staff didn’t allow the quarterbacks to go through progressions? You were to look for your top target on the play and if he wasn’t open then run.

Overall the defense played well. One issue I have is why can’t the defensive backs track a ball in the air. Wolff was terrible Friday yet his biggest plays came when he just turned it loose and hoped for Jennings to save him. On two of those plays VT defensive backs weren’t tracking the football.

The Hokies also need more from their pass rush. You can’t live and die by the blitz.

The Hokies have a stiff test next week when Boston College comes to Blacksburg. They are going to have to be a lot better against a good B.C. team."

Electronic devices and software can perform very different tasks but they all work by switching the chip transistors that control the current

Semiconductors are a critical part of almost every modern electronic device and the vast majority of semiconductors are made in Taiwan. Increasing concerns over the reliance on Taiwan for semiconductors – especially given the tenuous relationship between Taiwan and China – led the US Congress to pass the CHIPS and Science act in late July 2022. The act provides more than US$50 billion in subsidies to boost US semiconductor production and has been widely covered in the news. Trevor Thornton an electrical engineer who studies semiconductors explains what these devices are and how they are made.

What is a semiconductor?

Generally speaking the term semiconductor refers to a material – like silicon – that can conduct electricity much better than an insulator such as glass but not as well as metals like copper or aluminum. But when people are talking about semiconductors today they are usually referring to semiconductor chips.

These chips are typically made from thin slices of silicon with complex components laid out on them in specific patterns. These patterns control the flow of current using electrical switches – called transistors – in much the same way you control the electrical current in your home by flipping a switch to turn on a light.

The difference between your house and a semiconductor chip is that semiconductor switches are entirely electrical – no mechanical components to flip – and the chips contain tens of billions of switches in an area not much larger than the size of a fingernail.

What do semiconductors do?

Semiconductors are how electronic devices process store and receive information. For instance memory chips store data and software as binary code digital chips manipulate the data based on the software instructions and wireless chips receive data from high-frequency radio transmitters and convert them into electrical signals. These different chips work together under the control of software. Different software applications perform very different tasks but they all work by switching the transistors that control the current.

How do you build a semiconductor chip?

The starting point for the vast majority of semiconductors is a thin slice of silicon called a wafer. Today’s wafers are the size of dinner plates and are cut from single silicon crystals. Manufacturers add elements like phosphorus and boron in a thin layer at the surface of the silicon to increase the chip’s conductivity. It is in this surface layer where the transistor switches are made.

The transistors are built by adding thin layers of conductive metals insulators and more silicon to the entire wafer sketching out patterns on these layers using a complicated process called lithography and then selectively removing these layers using computer-controlled plasmas of highly reactive gases to leave specific patterns and structures. Because the transistors are so small it is much easier to add materials in layers and then carefully remove unwanted material than it is to place microscopically thin lines of metal or insulators directly onto the chip. By depositing patterning and etching layers of different materials dozens of times semiconductor manufacturers can create chips with tens of billions of transistors per square inch.

How are chips today different from the early chips?

There are many differences but the most important is probably the increase in the number of transistors per chip.

Among the earliest commercial applications for semiconductor chips were pocket calculators which became widely available in the 1970s. These early chips contained a few thousand transistors. In 1989 Intel introduced the the first semiconductors to exceed a million transistors on a single chip. Today the largest chips contain more than 50 billion transistors. This trend is described by what is known as Moore’s law which says that the number of transistors on a chip will double approximately every 18 months.

Number of transistors on a single microprocessor

As seen in the chart below starting in the 1970s the number of transistors on a single chip has roughly doubled every 18 months.

Moore’s law has held up for five decades. But in recent years the semiconductor industry has had to overcome major challenges – mainly how to continue shrinking the size of transistors – to continue this pace of advancement.

One solution was to switch from flat two-dimensional layers to three-dimensional layering with fin-shaped ridges of silicon projecting up above the surface. These 3D chips significantly increased the number of transistors on a chip and are now in widespread use but they’re also much more difficult to manfacture.

Do more complicated chips require more sophisticated factories?

Simply put yes the more complicated the chip the more complicated – and more costly – the factory.

There was a time when almost every US semiconductor company built and maintained its own factories. But today a new foundry can cost more than $10 billion to build. Only the largest companies can afford that kind of investment. Instead the majority of semiconductor companies send their designs to independent foundries for manufacturing. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and GlobalFoundries headquartered in New York are two examples of multinational foundries that build chips for other companies. They have the expertise and economies of scale to invest in the hugely expensive technology required to produce next-generation semiconductors.

Ironically while the transistor and semiconductor chip were invented in the US no state-of-the-art semiconductor foundries are currently on American soil. The US has been here before in the 1980s when there were concerns that Japan would dominate the global memory business. But with the newly passed CHIPS act Congress has provided the incentives and opportunities for next-generation semiconductors to be manufactured in the US.

Perhaps the chips in your next iPhone will be “designed by Apple in California built in the USA.” – Rappler.com

The Biden administration has moved to further restrict China's access to advanced semiconductor products and technology placing seven more Chinese entities of aerospace on its export control list late August and ordering Nvidia and AMD last week to stop providing high-end artificial intelligence and supercomputing microchips to Chinese companies in Washington's complete disregard for international trade rules.The US government is intent on engaging in a zero-sum game but as the saying goes: those who seek to block the way of others will only end up blocking their own way. By constantly politicizing and weaponizing trade and economic issues Washington is only demonstrating to the world's other countries the growing risks of dependence on the US spurring them to look elsewhere.And the US' deepening partisan fight exacerbating political dysfunction and polarization between have and have-nots in the country is dimming the attraction of the US as a destination for work and study for talented people from across the world which will ultimately erode the hegemonic power.American politicians seem to have lost patience as they attempt to impede China's rapid economic and technological progress. Recently they have gone reckless to thwart China at the cost of diminishing the business of America's own companies. Nvidia admitted in a filing to US Securities and Exchange Commission that barring Chinese customers from buying its advanced chips will cause the chipmaker to lose at least $400 million a year.To shore up the US' global semiconductor dominance Washington has lately taken a series of actions to chip away at the distinctive strength and know-how of Samsung and TSMC the world's leading high-caliber chipmakers.Also the US government following a year's worth of meticulous planning came out with a new law to heavily subsidize America's private semiconductor manufacturers. Billed as the CHIPS (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America) and Science Act which US President Biden signed three weeks ago the US law would provide a total of $52.7 billion for American semiconductor research development manufacturing and workforce training.The White House in a statement boasts the CHIPS and Science Law will help lower American production costs strengthen its own supply chain and at the same time counter China's technology rise. A key provision of that bill imposes limits on advanced semiconductor production in China for all American subsidy recipients.The Biden administration has yet to establish detailed guidelines for evaluating grant applications and it is unclear when projects will be financed by the new law. The mainstream American media have praised the act as a measure to help create many good-paying jobs within US shores while the law will work to ""subdue"" China's technological advance in the coming years.Like all recent US legislation meant to address its supply chain anxiety the most prominent behind-the-scenes driver of the latest actions by Washington is China - or more precisely fear of China.So far the US department of commerce has put as many as 600 Chinese entities on its export restriction list more than 110 of which have been added since Biden came to office. These 600 entities are the key business players in almost all China's competitive sectors such as telecom information semiconductors aerospace supercomputing and AI.Will the ruthless US assault decimate Chinese scientists' indigenous innovation? The answer is a clear no. Washington's attack will only slow down China's progress in some technology fields in a short time. But China will weather the attack and come out of it much stronger which has been verified by China's advancements in 4G and 5G information technology high-speed railway technology spacecraft launching and in-orbit maneuvering and control technology.Yes the US' repressive and coercive actions will only force Chinese scientists and technicians to come up with even greater research development and innovation efforts to catch up with the world's leading chip manufacturers.Currently East Asia including China's Taiwan and South Korea lead the US and Europe in critical innovations related to microchips manufacturing. China's mainland market consumes up to 40 percent of global output of semiconductor microchips which explains why the world's major chipmakers are accelerating their investment in the Chinese mainland because the top market is located here.Another important factor is China has tens of thousands of well-educated relatively young and inexpensive workers and these advantages cannot be easily found on other continents.Feeling threatened by the East Asia Chips Prevalence the Biden administration has been keen since its inauguration to reduce America's dependence on East Asia for a critical technology. To put it in perspective the US CHIPS and Science Act is a best testament of American calculation and skullduggery.In addition to weakening East Asia's chips-making capability the latest string of US actions also reflect the Biden administration's ignominious idea of ""decoupling"" from China including Chinese technology and Chinese manufacturing.The White House said the US will strengthen America's own supply chain and maintain the US' leading status across the industries of future including robotics clean technology quantum computing and artificial intelligence. Aren't Chinese enterprises now leading most of the research and development of these technologies?For quite a long time the world has looked to synergy between US and China including proper coordination on macro and industrial policies and mutually beneficial nature of working together to help preserve stable global industry and supply chains.However the Biden administration concerned and skittish about China's rapid emergence in economic size and global influence has taken a U-turn bucking the historic trend of cooperation and started to contain and hold back China's growth.Publically the Biden administration has claimed before the world press that it does not seek to contain China's development but the claim rings very hollow. In practice the administration has placed many high-tech Chinese companies such as Huawei Technologies and SMIC on the American government's Entity List that bars exports of US technology to the ""blacklisted"" companies - which Chinese industry watchers call ""technological terrorism"".And by defining China as a strategic competitor the Biden administration inherited the tariffs war from his predecessor Donald Trump and moved to intensify the trade war against China. After all it is American consumers that have borne the brunt of the real-world consequences of their politicians' reckless pursuit of trade and economic decoupling from China.The author is an editor with the Global Times. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vY3liZXJuZXdzLmNvbS90ZWNoL2FyZS1jb21wdXRlci1jaGlwcy10aGUtbmV3LW51Y2xlYXItYXJtcy1yYWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are computer chips the new nuclear arms race?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://cybernews.com/tech/are-computer-chips-the-new-nuclear-arms-race/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vY3liZXJuZXdzLmNvbS90ZWNoL2FyZS1jb21wdXRlci1jaGlwcy10aGUtbmV3LW51Y2xlYXItYXJtcy1yYWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkYi5nb3Yuc2cvZW4vYnVzaW5lc3MtaW5zaWdodHMvaW5zaWdodHMvc291dGhlYXN0LWFzaWEtcy1yaXNpbmctc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3Rvci1mb3J0dW5lcy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southeast Asia's rising semiconductor fortunes | Singapore EDB,

During the reunion Henke and Mason reminisced about their first day in the majors together.

Henke said “I remember talking to Mike in the outfield in old Arlington Stadium and we’re looking at each other and saying `hey we’re here.’ “

Henke and another reliever who would reach the majors Jack Lazorko and Dennis Long gave the Drillers an unbeatable bullpen down the stretch after Lazorko returned to Tulsa from Triple-A Denver.

Henke and Lazorko who also was at the reunion were two of the 14 players with the ‘82 Drillers who reached the majors. Slugging first baseman Mike Rubel would likely have joined that list if he had not suffered a career-altering broken wrist after being promoted to Triple-A Oklahoma City in 1983.

Rubel did have a major league moment that summer when the Drillers hosted the parent Texas Rangers in an exhibition for the first time and he hit two homers — those didn’t count in his official stats.

Rubel had not seen most of his ‘82 teammates (except for Texas Rangers TV studio analyst Steve Buechele who was not at the reunion) in almost 40 years until this weekend.

For Rubel and the others at the reunion it was easy to pick up where they left off so many years ago.

“We were in a hotel bar last night until about 1:30 when they kicked us out telling old war stories it was so much fun to relive those stories” Rubel said.

“I thought after 40 years with as much fun as we liked to have that it would have taken its toll a little worse than it has but everybody looks great.”

Lazorko added “It’s great to be back it’s been unbelievable catching up with relationships and talking about how things used to be in both old ballparks.”

Henke encouraged by his family to attend was at the reunion two days after his mother’s funeral.

“Just great friendships some guys I’ve seen today I haven’t seen in 40 years and its almost like we never left other than we’ve changed a little bit appearance-wise” Henke said with a smile.

The Drillers’ ‘81-82 manager Tom Burgess died in 2008.

“I loved Tommy he helped get me to the big leagues” said Henke who was inducted into the Drillers Wall of Fame in 2002 after being one of the majors’ top relievers from 1985-95. Henke retired after being the National League’s top reliever in 1995 with St. Louis to return home to Jefferson City Missouri where he still lives. At the reunion he was wearing his Drillers championship ring and Toronto Blue Jays 1992 World Series ring.

Rubel had an incredible calendar year for the Drillers from mid-1982 to mid-1983 with 36 homers in 136 games which would be a team record for a single season. Schedules back then were 136 games. Rubel asked the Rangers if he could stay in Tulsa for the entire ‘83 season to see what incredible numbers he could post after hitting 23 homers in the first half but the request was denied. He also played for Tulsa for two months in 1986.

Other special moments from that Tulsa baseball summer of ‘82 included hosting the Texas League All-Star Game with the All-Stars playing Oklahoma City Tim Henry’s seven-inning no-hitter (on the day of the PGA Championship’s final round at Southern Hills) and a 23-inning win at Jackson in July — Henke pitched four shutout innings in that game and Rubel went 3-for-10 with a homer and two RBIs.

""I remember (Jackson's) Daryl Strawberry was going to score in the 17th inning but he went into home plate standing up if he slides the game's over but (catcher) Donnie Scott catches his leg right before he hits home plate and we keep on going"" Rubel said. ""There were about 9 or 11 people left in the stands at the end I think Jackson gave them all season tickets.

""And the thing I remember the most is Steve and I wake up the next afternoon and it's pouring rain. We just started jumping up and down. It was the greatest rainout of all-time. Most of us could hardly even move.""

Rubel and Buechele were part of a spectacular turnaround as they joined the team after the Drillers finished 19 games under .500 in the first half.

“Mike and Steve were two big keys to our winning” Henke said. “But everybody chipped in and did their part.”

The Drillers were 46-23 in the second half also boosted by the additions of a future long time major leaguer shortstop Curtis Wilkerson along with center fielder Brett Benza.

Rubel joined the Drillers directly from Cal State Fullerton and Buechele from Stanford — players rarely go right from the major league draft to Double-A anymore.

“All I had heard was they were one of the worst teams in baseball won very few games” Rubel said. “Steve and I showed up and they had released a bunch of people and people were throwing stuff and cleaning out their lockers.

“Unbelievable we came back from that. Quite an accomplishment now that I think about it.”

In the playoffs the Drillers won the three-game division series at Jackson where they had lost in heartbreaking fashion a year earlier. Tulsa then went on to sweep El Paso in three games in the finals. It was Tulsa pro baseball’s first pennant in eight years and first TL title since ‘63.

“It’s always great to win it all” Lazorko said. “It was a great time.”

Lazorko went on to pitch five seasons in the majors. Besides being a college baseball TV analyst he is Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association’s president for the Dallas-Fort Worth chapter.

Although Rubel didn’t reach the majors he has enjoyed a very successful career in a tile and stone installation business that he owns in Yorba Linda California. Among those he has done work for include Tiger Woods Mark McGwire and many ballplayers he knows.

Rubel never imagined that type of career when he was with the Drillers an amazingly successful shift — just as was Tulsa’s 1982 pennant-winning season after a bad first half.

“That was pretty incredible” Henke said. “We just got on a roll. It was a great run.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Investors have abandoned many cloud-services stocks in the wake of the pandemic on fears that demand gains will collapse as the world returns to more normal working patterns. But the cloud-security niche is showing no signs of such a growth hangover.

Palo Alto Networks (PANW -0.23%) recently announced strong sales trends through its fiscal fourth quarter that ended in late July. Management also projected another year of more than 20% annual sales gains ahead.

Yes investors shouldn't read too much into short-term operating trends. But Palo Alto Networks' success implies bigger earnings gains ahead as the company prepares to reach $7 billion in annual sales.

Let's take a closer look.

The growing industry

Investors were happy to hear management raise its fiscal year outlook back in May but it turns out that the business wasn't done producing pleasant surprises. Revenue in fiscal Q4 jumped 27% to $1.6 billion beating Palo Alto Networks' upgraded forecast.

For the year the company gained market share in a spending niche that is becoming more important to a growing number of large businesses. ""Our integrated three-platform strategy"" CEO Nikesh Arora said in a press release ""continues to drive large deal momentum.""

Executives added context about that momentum in a shareholder presentation that stressed how the company has expanded its selling footprint into more categories around network and cloud security since 2018. This transformation has accelerated sales growth but it also created more predictable cash and earnings streams thanks to the software-as-a-service (SAAS) selling model.

Finally profitable

One big knock against the stock has always been the company's persistent net losses. For the year that ended in late July this red ink landed at $367 million compared to $500 million in the prior year.

But that disappointing track record could be over. Palo Alto Networks reached profitability for the first time in four years this quarter with GAAP earnings touching $3 million. Yes that equates to a tiny net margin on $1.6 billion of revenue. But it could be the start of a steady march toward impressive profitability. Software industry leader Microsoft enjoys operating profit margins over 40% after all.

Palo Alto Networks doesn't enjoy anything approaching Microsoft's huge and diverse portfolio. Yet there's room for it to become much more profitable over time.

Looking ahead

Investors shouldn't get too excited about Palo Alto Network's short-term earnings outlook. The company is only predicting barely breaking even this year. But two metrics imply much higher profits ahead. The first is sales growth which could reach 25% in the new fiscal year to mark just a modest slowdown from the prior year's 29% spike.

The second is cash flow with Palo Alto Networks on track to convert over 33% of sales into free cash flow this year after adjustments. It is conceivable that operating profit margin will move toward that rate over time assuming the company continues winning share in steadily growing niches around cloud and network security.

But investors interested in this space shouldn't wait around and simply watch this stock from the sidelines until those gains occur. The tilt into profitability this past quarter while modest marks a good time to consider buying Palto Alto Networks if you've been on the fence about this tech stock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhbG9hbHRvb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDkvMDQvYXJvdW5kLXRvd24tYW5kcmV3LWx1Y2staXMtaGVhZGluZy1iYWNrLXRvLXN0YW5mb3JkLXRoaXMtdGltZS1hcy1hLWdyYWQtc3R1ZGVudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Around Town: Andrew Luck is heading back to Stanford — this time as a grad student,"Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

Stanford alumnus Andrew Luck is set to return to the university as a graduate student this fall. Embarcadero Media file photo.

In the latest Around Town column read news about Stanford alumnus Andrew Luck’s plans to pursue a master’s degree at his alma mater this fall and a Palo Alto restauranteur who recently won $10000 on a Food Network show.

BIG MAN BACK ON CAMPUS … A decade after graduating from Stanford University alumnus Andrew Luck is preparing to return to campus in the fall — this time as a graduate student.

The former NFL quarterback played seven seasons with the Indianapolis Colts before retiring in 2019. He decided to leave the game at age 29 due to an “unrelenting” cycle of undergoing injuries pain and rehabilitation which left him feeling “stuck” he said during a press conference at the time.

Luck’s pursuit for an advanced degree was revealed by Stanford football coach David Shaw during an Aug. 29 interview on The Rich Eisen Show. “He’s very content on his NFL career. Not fired up about how it ended but it did end” Shaw said of Luck. “He did a lot of great things and brought a lot of joy to the people of Indianapolis and now for him it’s time for chapter two.”

Shaw also noted that Luck who turns 33 later this month recently had his second child with his wife Nicole who also graduated from Stanford in 2012.

The Stanford Daily reported that Luck is pursuing a master’s degree in Education according to Stanford Profiles which doesn’t indicate whether he’ll be part of the university’s football team.

A TASTY VICTORY … An email to Zola and BarZola chef and owner Guillaume Bienaime contained an offer he couldn’t refuse — a chance to compete against chef and Food Network personality Alex Guarnaschelli and two other contestants on Guarnaschelli’s show “Alex vs. America.”

Months after a 12-hour day of filming in Los Angeles the episode aired on Aug. 21 and Bienaime could finally share the big news with his Palo Alto restaurant’s patrons: He had beaten Guarnaschelli and the other contestants to win $10000 which he donated to chef Jose Andres‘ nonprofit World Central Kitchen.

“Alex vs. America” pits Guarnaschelli against three contestants from around the country who are experts in a particular cuisine. The contestants start off in the “survival round” picking between different factors they must account for such as how much time they’re given to cook and what type of meat they can use. Their food and Guarnaschelli’s is then judged blindly by two anonymous judges who select the best dish of the round.

If Guarnaschelli loses the round the contestant with the best dish gets to pick the cooking factors again in the “money round” where the remaining two contestants can win up to $10000 for beating Guarnaschelli. If she wins the first round she has control over the cooking factors for the second and final round.

Bienaimé’s episode was focused on French cuisine where Guarnaschelli’s training is focused. He knew French food was her specialty but said he had prepared to win.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx1eHRpbWVzLmx1L2J1c2luZXNzYW5kZmluYW5jZS9sdXhlbWJvdXJnLXJhbnNvbXdhcmUtaGFja2Vycy10dXJuLW9uLWl0YWx5LzEzNDA1ODguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hackers who hit Luxembourg turn on Italy,"A hacker group with links to Russia has claimed responsibility for a recent ransomware attack targeting Italy’s energy industry which Rome says could be related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In a post published on the so-called dark web the BlackCat group said it stole 700 gigabytes of data from networks controlled by Italy’s GSE energy agency and threatened to publish the information online if its demands were ignored. The post was accompanied by several images of what appeared to be internal documents. The size of BlackCat’s extortion demand wasn’t immediately clear.

The group also known as ALPHV breaks into its victims’ computers and uses malicious software to encrypt files stored on them so that the files cannot be accessed. The gang then demands payment to unlock the files. BlackCat has targeted a wide range of companies in recent months including law firms building contractors a video game maker and technology suppliers. The group is also known for attacks on the energy sector.

In July BlackCat breached Luxembourg-based gas and energy provider Creos Luxembourg and its parent company Encevo SA. In February hackers affiliated with the same cyber-crime gang infected computers at Mabanaft GmbH and Oiltanking GmbH.

Luxembourg's main energy supplier admitted in August that hackers had published a trove client data on the darkweb and advised clients to closely monitor their bank accounts and change passwords for online services. Cybersecurity firms tied the Encevo attack to BlackCat.

Italy's GSE said earlier this week that it suffered a breach resulting in the company shutting down some IT systems. In addition to other functions GSE is one of the government agencies responsible for running Italy’s electricity market.

On Wednesday Italian giant Eni SpA said that its computer networks had been hacked adding that the consequences appeared to be minor. No one has claimed responsibility for that attack to date. Prime Minister Mario Draghi later convened a meeting with top Italian officials to discuss the incidents.

Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said on Friday that cyberattacks on western European companies have risen following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The minister added that the attacks are part of a destabilization strategy seen since the invasion in February without specifying their source.

Researchers at Unit 42 a cybersecurity team at Palo Alto Networks Inc. have linked BlackCat’s members to Russia pointing out that the group communicates with its members or affiliates in the Russian language and is known to operate on Russian cybercrime forums.

It’s unknown whether the BlackCat gang operates under the direction of the Russian state. The group may have some members or affiliates who are based outside the country according to cybersecurity researchers. Connections between the Russian cybercrime world and the country’s intelligence agencies are notoriously muddy.

The BlackCat gang has links to another ransomware group named DarkSide which last year breached Colonial Pipeline Co. according to Brett Callow a threat analyst at cybersecurity firm Emsisoft. Callow said BlackCat’s targeting of energy companies stands out as particularly dangerous as it’s possible for such attacks to disrupt supplies of electricity or gas.

After the DarkSide hack for instance Colonial Pipeline shut down the largest fuel pipeline in in the US for several days resulting in fuel shortages across the East Coast. The hackers Callow said aren’t always in a position to know the impact their attacks will have and may not even care.

In April last year the US Treasury issued sanctions against Russia and alleged that the country’s FSB intelligence agency “cultivates and co-opts criminal hackers” and enables them “to engage in disruptive ransomware attacks and phishing campaigns.”

The 39-year-old software engineer from Atlanta grew up watching “Star Trek” and it strongly shaped his beliefs he said later. “It kind of built my values as a kid in a way because I didn’t have any other values really.”

The politics of “Star Trek” are familiar territory for cast members like Blu del Barrio Wilson Cruz Michelle Hurd and Anthony Rapp who have played roles on “Star Trek: Discovery” and “Star Trek: Picard.” The four performers spoke in front of a thousand screaming fans in downtown Atlanta.

“’Star Trek’ is defined as infinite diversity in infinite combinations” Cruz said. “If that’s true and if that is our aim progress towards that has to be modeled. That’s what science-fiction does for us it helps us imagine what that’s going to look like … and that is inherently political.”

Popular on Variety

“Star Trek” is one of — if not the most — popular tracks for the fan-driven convention. Atlanta’s hotel halls fill with cosplay of Vulcans and Klingons and this year more than a few Lt. Uhura’s in homage to Nichelle Nichols the trailblazing original “Star Trek” cast member who died July 30 at age 89.

The property’s popularity at the convention long predates Paramount+ even going beyond the inception internet. It has weathered lean times for the “Star Trek” universe. Now fans and insiders alike expect to feast in the current abundance of new “Star Trek” content.

“What I want is new fans” said Leo Visentin assistant director for the “Star Trek” convention track. “I want the franchise to grow and continue and be inspiring to people because it is important and the things that it talks about are social commentaries and are important. Getting new fans is probably the most important part of the process. Because otherwise you know if you’re just appeasing old fans they get cranky and then it goes and dies.”

Conservative commentary on Fox News and other outlets has opened an attack on the “woke” politics of “Star Trek” after the launch of the new “Strange New Worlds” series in May largely ignoring the original show’s groundbreaking displays of diversity and calls for racial justice.

Notably Paramount Global announced in August that the Paramount+ streaming service added 4.9 million global subscribers in the most recent quarter. Paramount executives cited the popularity of “Strange New Worlds” as a driver of subscription growth.

“I don’t think they necessarily feel like we’re… feeling the weight of Paramount” Hurd said. “Paramount was smart to create this and to back this and to support this because we are speaking the moral truth.”

Hurd described her political work on the Crown Act a multistate initiative to protect people from being discriminated against at work for maintaining a natural hairstyle – a problem disproportionately affecting Black women. Georgia has no such law.

Dragon Con unfolds annually in an increasingly contested political battleground state. Star Trek’s cultural and political posture inexorably – and at times deliberately – exerts influence on Georgia. For one gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams made a cameo appearance on “Star Trek: Discovery” in May. A mention of that elicited a cheer from the Dragon Con audience.

“She’s a big ‘Star Trek’ fan” Rapp said. “Part of the reason I believe she loves ‘Star Trek is all the reasons we were talking about: what the world presents is the world that she wants to be a part of and see.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vY2xhcmsuY29tL3N0cmVhbWluZy10di9wYXJhbW91bnQtcGx1cy1zaG93dGltZS1tZXJnZS1vZmZlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paramount+ Customers Get Limited-Time Showtime Offer As Apps Merge,"If you’re a Paramount+ customer now may be the time to explore what Showtime has to offer as well.

In addition to the original shows Showtime also has a large menu of movies. This will pair nicely with the movies you already get from Paramount as a Paramount+ subscriber.

Showtime has exclusive broadcasting rights to some sporting events as well. This includes Bellator MMA events and Showtime Championship Boxing.

Final Thoughts

The bundling of streaming services continues as Disney+ Hulu HBO Max and discovery+ are in the midst of their own bundling efforts.

This is the natural progression of a streaming landscape that saw an initial race to market to claim cord-cutting customers turn into an effort to retain customers for the long term. Services teaming up or being consolidated by industry heavyweights is an effort to provide “value” for the price of a subscription in hopes of cementing long-term relationships with customers.

It’s harder to hit the “cancel button” on a bundle when there’s a greater chance that someone in the household is enjoying content from one of the services in the bundle.

Paramount Global which owns both Paramount+ and Showtime likely saw that Showtime had a tough road ahead as a stand-alone product as the popularity of premium cable packages wanes. Bringing it under the Paramount+ umbrella both strengthens the Paramount+ product and creates a space where Showtime can flourish in the streaming era.

You might have mimed riding a pony Gangnam Style in 2012. But some argue that Psy’s K-pop gateway drug was a novelty record and not a true expression of the precision-tooled gendered group phenomenon that is K-Pop. Sonically K-pop beats western pop at its own game taking the busier upbeat end of US R&B and supercharging it stuffing each track with multiple melodies umpteen pre-choruses and sometimes a sprinkling of Korean tradition: TikTok was made for K-Pop and it turns out Korean is a terrific language to rap in.

Beyond established stars like BTS BlackPink and upstarts Monsta X the K-Pop universe is vast and deep. New-ish girl group Loona ram dozens of meme-worthy snippets together while Aespa’s 2020 hit Black Mamba introduced a band with parallel universe alter egos. The boys favour all-caps names like EXO and perhaps frustratingly for the UK’s National Childbirth Trust NCT; TXT have taken the genre more pop-punk and emo of late.

But there’s much more to Korean music than pop on steroids. The superlative Park Jiha is an ambient producer who combines western minimalism with traditional Korean instruments. The duo Dal:um are even more minimal trading lines on the gayageum and the geomungo the spaces as important as the notes.

Parasite’s historic best picture Oscar win brought modern Korean cinema into the mainstream but Bong Joon-ho’s wily class-war thriller is no isolated highlight. New converts should also seek out the richly philosophical work of Lee Chang-dong (peaking with the masterful Murakami adaptation Burning) the playful time-collapsing comedies of Hong Sang-soo (Right Now Wrong Then) the wild genre stylings of Kim Jee-woon (never more accessible than in his lush espionage saga The Age of Shadows) and of course the diverse oeuvre of Park Chan-wook from brutal manga-inspired actioner Oldboy to his coolly erotic Sarah Waters remix The Handmaiden.

Korean drama went stratospheric during lockdown thanks to viral hit Squid Game but the nation’s TV industry has long been on an inexorable rise. Melodrama Winter Sonata and period epic Jewel in the Palace kickstarted the K-wave in the 00s. Streaming service Rakuten Viki is now home to later gems like romance Guardian: The Lonely and Great God and retro romp Reply 1988.

Netflix launched in Korea in 2016 and has ploughed millions into local production. Ye olde zombie thriller Kingdom was its first Korean original before horror chiller Sweet Home became the first K-drama to break into the US top 10. Last autumn apocalyptic fantasy Hellbound overtook Squid Game in the Netflix most-watched charts while Apple TV+ launched its first Korean show sci-fi mystery Dr Brain.

“So do I sue starbucks for giving me a mf rotten ass cheese danish ?? having me step out my car throwing up . wtfffffd I’m scarred” DaniLeigh tweeted.

After the tweet gained some traction the singer asked fans if they’d like to see a photo of the rotten pastry. “Y’all wanna see a pic of this shit ????” she wrote.

She then shared a photo of the cheese danish about 20 minutes later showing the pastry with a large mold spot in the middle of it.

DaniLeigh captioned the pic: “Idk if I’ll ever get something for u guys again but honestly I deserve free @Starbucks for the rest of my life … I threw up taking this pic.”

The danish appeared to have been bitten into it several times which one follower pointed out writing: “So it took ar minimum 3 bites to realize the mold in it?”

Dani snapped back: “Bitch I was not looking at it.”

The receipt in the photo displayed the Starbucks store number as 27563 which the company’s customer service confirmed is likely located inside a Fort Lauderdale airport in Florida (via The Shade Room).

The Starbucks Care Twitter account has since responded to DaniLeigh’s tweet thanking her “for reaching out and bringing this to our attention.” The Starbucks representative added: “Please DM us with the provided link I’d like to get additional information regarding your experience.”

It is not clear whether DaniLeigh got her request for free Starbucks for the rest of her life but the singer did retweet the messages from Starbucks.

Since it first premiered in 2009 RuPaul’s Drag Race and its growing international spinoffs have seen hundreds of lip sync performances. The Lip Sync For Your Life is a foundational part of the Drag Race experience. And on the American version of the show RuPaul himself is extremely hands-on with the selection process of the songs that are used in the lip sync battles.

The ‘Lip Sync For Your Life’ is an essential part of ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’

From the first-ever battle to “Supermodel (You Better Work)” to grandiose finale performance in front of hundreds of people in a packed theater lip syncs on RuPaul’s Drag Race are as competitive as they are entertaining.

Most episodes culminate in a Lip Sync For Your Life between two (or more) queens to determine who will shantay and who will sashay away. In more recent years seasons culminate in a Lip Sync For the Crown tournament as the winner is determined by who wins the most lip sync battles. And on RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars queens Lip Sync For Your Legacy for a cash tip and the power to eliminate one of their fellow competitors.

Over the years there have been plenty of unforgettable lip sync moments from gag-worthy reveals to snafus like Valentina’s mask and Asia O’Hara’s finale butterfly massacre.

RuPaul is involved hands-on in choosing the lip sync songs

When it comes to choosing which songs are used for lip syncs RuPaul himself is more involved in the process than many would think. Drag Race executive producer Tom Campbell spoke to The WOW Report in August 2022 about how songs are chosen for the lip syncs. He credited the show’s music supervision team for their work behind the scenes and noted that RuPaul is involved with the process of choosing a track.

“He will reject songs because they’re the wrong tempo they don’t build… there’s all of these factors he’s thinking about” Campbell said. “Back in the iPod days when RuPaul gave you an iPod that he had loaded with music it was a gift from God. He is truly a Ph.D. in pop culture especially when it comes to music.”

Licensing songs for ‘Drag Race’ has become a big business

In the early days of the show licensing songs for lip syncs was no easy task with a small budget and no name recognition. Lack of proper licensing for example is what led to Season 1 of Drag Race being unavailable to watch for so long and dubbed “The Lost Season.”

Tom Campbell told The WOW Report about how difficult it was for the Drag Race team to secure licensing rights to certain songs when the show first premiered on LogoTV back in 2009.

“We were this little show that nobody knew. We were trying to get clearances and it was really tough” he said.

As the show skyrocketed in popularity and started racking up Emmy Awards over the next decade the music supervision team had to do less reaching out and instead artists started coming to them. Paramount Global’s Senior Vice President of Creative Music Strategy Rochelle Holguin Cappello explained how the song choice process has changed.

“The number of artists and labels that approach us has grown to a weekly cadence” she said. “The pitches include A-list artists just as frequently as emerging acts. We’ve been told so many times that it would be an artist’s dream to have their music performed on the show.”"

Elon Musk's friend David Sacks lost a bid to quash a Twitter subpoena because of his tweets.

Sacks's lawyers said the subpoena was too burdensome and duplicated a previous request.

Sacks only hired legal counsel because he told his podcast listeners he would the judge said.

One of Elon Musk's friends subpoenaed in the Twitter acquisition lawsuit has lost an appeal to quash the request because of his behavior on Twitter and his podcast a judge has ruled.

David Sacks the CEO of Craft Ventures and member of the ""PayPal mafia"" lost his appeal after being subpoenaed by Twitter for correspondence with Musk according to court documents from Chancellor Kathleen McCormick.

Sacks said on his ""All-In"" podcast on August 5 that he had been subpoenaed by the social media platform over his comments on the Twitter acquisition which he said was too broad.

""I have no involvement in this thing but they sent me the broadest ever subpoena. It's like 30 pages of requests. And now I gotta hire a lawyer to go quash this thing"" the former PayPal executive said.

Musk backed out of his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter saying he was misled on the number of fake accounts on the platform sparking suits and countersuits from the two parties. Musk appeared on Sacks's podcast in the middle of his takeover bid in May.

One of Sacks' tweets that caused his subpoena was thought to be a checklist of targets for Musk to address if and when he took control of Twitter.

Sacks a prominent venture capitalist had taken out a non-disclosure agreement to evaluate a potential investment in connection with Musk's acquisition of Twitter the filing said.

Sacks' lawyers said the Delaware requests from Twitter were inappropriate because they were ""unduly burdensome because they were duplicative of the California subpoenas and the return dates were too soon."" Sacks also complained about having to hire lawyers.

Sacks initially responded to the subpoena by tweeting a picture of a middle finger from a Mad magazine cover and posting a follow-up video from ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" of a character urinating on a subpoena.

This behavior prompted a complaint by Twitter and was cited by McCormick as the reason the subpoena could not be quashed. Sack's complaint about needing lawyers was also unnecessary she said and only appears to have occurred because Sack told his podcast listeners he would do so.

""In other circumstances I might view entirely duplicative subpoenas served for such tactical purposes as problematic. Where as here the subpoena recipient tweets the subpoenaing attorneys the middle finger and a video of someone urinating on subpoenas I am less bothered by it.







""In an apparent effort to keep Sacks's promise to his podcast listeners the movants created the very burden of which they now complain.""

McCormick's ruling may have implications for serial-tweeter Musk who has repeatedly used the platform to antagonize Twitter. Columbia Law professor Eric Talley told Insider she was likely to take antagonistic tweets into consideration in her ruling.

Whether you’re looking to consolidate your holdings on one platform or to boost your HODLing setup transferring between both platforms can be extremely useful.

In July 2022 PayPal finally released a long-awaited feature: allowing users to send crypto to external wallets. This feature wasn’t allowed a few months ago however. When PayPal decided to add support for cryptocurrencies in 2020 you could only buy and sell crypto within PayPal but not send it to external wallets.

This article will guide step-by-step on how to transfer crypto from PayPal to Coinbase and vice versa.

If you’re using Binance please read: How to Transfer Crypto from Binance to PayPal: Step-by-Step

How to Transfer Crypto From Coinbase to PayPal

Transferring from Coinbase to PayPal is a straightforward process as outlined in the steps below:

After logging in to your PayPal account head to the crypto section on the dashboard. Select the cryptocurrency you want to receive. Click on the Transfers button —the little icon with two arrows— and then “Receive.” Complete the ID verification process (which is only necessary if you’re using the service for the first time). You will get a crypto address that you’ll use for the particular asset you want to receive. Now you have to access your Coinbase account and click on Send/Receive choose Send and select the crypto you want to transfer.

Paste the crypto address from PayPal into Coinbase’s “to” section and click on “Continue” to confirm the transaction.

That’s essentially what you have to do. As a side note: always double and triple check that the address of each particular coin is correct and that the network corresponds to each crypto. Using a mistyped address or the wrong network (for example: sending an ERC-20 (Ethereum) token to a TRC-20 (TRON) network) will result in the loss of your funds.

It’s worth pointing out that PayPal does not support every cryptoasset Coinbase does and as a result options are limited when it comes to transferring crypto from Coinbase to PayPal. Nevertheless it’s possible to transfer major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

How to Transfer From PayPal To Coinbase

The process is pretty much the same if users want to transfer from PayPal to Coinbase. In short:

Once you log in to your Coinbase account click on the Send/Receive tab at the top header and then click on Receive.

Copy the address in this case Ethereum. Head over to PayPal’s crypto section and choose the asset you want to receive. Paste the address from Coinbase and click on Continue.

Your funds should be available depending on the currency’s network congestion.

In essence you can send crypto from any personal crypto wallet to PayPal (as long as PayPal supports the currency). You just need the PayPal address and paste it into the sender’s wallet or vice versa.

While PayPal doesn’t charge fees for sending crypto to external wallets you will have to pay a network fee which PayPal will show you on the confirmation screen. Network fees depend on the network you’re using — Bitcoin network Ethereum network etc. – and are used to reward miners and validators.

FAQ

Can I Use the Same Address For Each Crypto Deposit?

It’s not recommended to re-use the same crypto address to move your funds due to security and privacy reasons. PayPal will provide you with a different address for each coin each time you want to move your funds.

Can I Send Crypto From PayPal to Any Exchange?

You can transfer crypto from PayPal to a valid wallet address whether a personal hot storage wallet or an exchange.

What Currencies Does PayPal Support?

PayPal supports four cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC). We will have to wait and see if PayPal decides to add support for more cryptoassets with its decision likely being based on a number of factors including demand from its users.

Can I Retrieve My Funds If I Send Them to the Wrong Address?

It’s highly recommended users « always triple check the address and the correct network for each coin. Note that PayPal supports each crypto on their native networks while cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase and Binance can support tokenized versions of a coin on another blockchain – for example wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on the Ethereum network.

Prior to its removal the Canadian-owned pornographic video-streaming website had more than 13 million followers on Instagram and had shared more than 6200 posts.

It’s unclear when exactly the Meta-owned social media giant took down the popular adult entertainment site but on Friday afternoon the founder and CEO of the nonprofit Justice Defense Fund Laila Mickelwait tweeted that the account “was just taken down.”

“Instagram has made the right decision by cutting ties with Pornhub and now joins Visa Mastercard Discover PayPal Grant Thornton Heinz Unilever Roku and many other companies in rejecting to do business with Pornhub a site infamous for monetizing the sex trafficking and criminal sexual abuse of countless victims including children” Mickelwait told the Daily News in an email Saturday.

“It is worth remembering that it’s illegal in the United States according to the Trafficking Victim’s Protection Act to knowingly benefit from a sex trafficking venture” she added urging other companies to do the same. “Now it’s finally time for Google search Amazon Web Services Google Cloud Microsoft Azure and Reflected Networks to follow suit.”

Instagram’s parent company Meta didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The National Center on Sexual Exploitation a nonprofit that focuses on “exposing the links between all forms of sexual abuse and exploitation” applauded Instagram’s move saying that the decision indicates that the platform “understands the mounting evidence of Pornhub’s criminality.”

“Instagram was right to remove Pornhub from its platform for violating its community standards given the increasing reports of Pornhub hosting child sexual abuse material sex trafficking filmed rape and non-consensual videos and images. Instagram served as a distribution partner with this criminal enterprise helping to push millions to their website including children” the group’s CEO Dawn Hawkins said in a statement Saturday.

“We are grateful that Instagram has heard the voices of sexual abuse survivors who have been personally harmed by Pornhub’s insatiable appetite for profit” Hawkins added.

Pornhub didn’t share pornographic videos or images on Instagram but according to the NCOSE the account “directly promoted pornography and featured videos like ‘Next Career Goal’ encouraging its audience to become a pornography performer.”

“Instagram is courageously choosing to stop partnering with Pornhub and it is time for all corporate entities to follow its example” Hawkins said.

Last month both Visa and Mastercard announced that they were suspending payment privileges of TrafficJunky the advertising arm of Pornhub’s parent company MindGeek Variety reported.",,,,,,

Coca-Cola Co. McDonald’s Corp. Starbucks Corp. and Yum! Brands Inc. to the growing list of companies suspending some operations in Russia over that country’s invasion of Ukraine.

Ramon Laguarta chief executive officer of PepsiCo Inc. Purchase NY said in an email to employees on March 8 that the company would suspend the sale of beverages like Pepsi Cola 7UP and Mirinda as well as capital investments and all advertising in Russia.

“As a food and beverage company now more than ever we must stay true to the humanitarian aspect of our business” Mr. Laguarta wrote. “That means we have a responsibility to continue to offer our other products in Russia including daily essentials such as milk and other dairy offerings baby formula and baby food. By continuing to operate we will also continue to support the livelihoods of our 20000 Russian associates and the 40000 Russian agricultural workers in our supply chain as they face significant challenges and uncertainty ahead.”

Mr. Laguarta added that PepsiCo has suspended operations in Ukraine and is working to provide aid to Ukrainian refugees in neighboring countries through donations to aid agencies and the ramping up of production at other PepsiCo manufacturing plants in Europe.

The Coca-Cola Co. Atlanta released a brief statement March 8 that it was “suspending its businesses” in Russia but did not provide details.

McDonald’s temporarily will close all its restaurants in Russia and pause all operations in that market according to an email sent March 8 by Chris Kempczinski CEO to employees and franchises.

On the same day Kevin Johnson president and CEO of Starbucks wrote employees saying the company was suspending all business activity in Russia. The company has approximately 130 locations in the country.

“Our licensed partner has agreed to immediately pause store operations and will provide support to the nearly 2000 partners in Russia who depend on Starbucks for their livelihood” he wrote.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine also drew a reaction from Yum! Brands. The owner of the KFC Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands suspended all investment and restaurant development in Russia.

In Russia McDonald’s at the end of 2021 had 847 restaurants with 84% operated by the company. The chain had 108 in Ukraine all operated by the company. The two countries accounted for 2% of McDonald’s systemwide sales in 2021.

“We understand the impact this will have on our Russian colleagues and partners which is why we are prepared to support all three legs of the stool in Ukraine and Russia” Mr. Kempczinski said of restaurants closing in Russia. “This includes salary continuation for all McDonald’s employees in Russia.”

Chicago-based McDonald’s also is paying full salaries to Ukrainian employees has donated $5 million to an employee assistance fund and is supporting relief efforts by the International Red Cross.

“Across the rest of Europe we will stay focused on how McDonald’s can best help those in need both now and in the future” Mr. Kempczinski said. “We have already seen extraordinary leadership by our Ukrainian and Russian teams and I know the rest of the McDonald’s system stands ready to support the large number of refugees who have been displaced by this conflict.

“As we move forward McDonald’s will continue to assess the situation and determine if any additional measures are required. At this juncture it’s impossible to predict when we might be able to reopen our restaurants in Russia. We are experiencing disruptions to our supply chain along with other operational impacts. We will also closely monitor the humanitarian situation.”

Louisville Ky.-based Yum! has about 1000 KFC restaurants and 50 Pizza Hut locations in Russia. Independent operators run nearly all the restaurants under license or franchise agreements. Yum! is donating $1 million to the Red Cross is activating a disaster relief fund to support Ukrainian franchise employees and is matching donations from employees to charities providing relief in Ukraine.

“McDonald’s and other fast-food outlets are under pressure to withdraw from the Russian market” said Ramsey Baghdadi a consumer analyst for GlobalData March 8. “However this is easier said than done for the fast-food industry. Russia represents approximately 0.7% of the global fast-food restaurant’s value in 2020. Such a small proportion of value generation in Russia tells us that fears of losing sales is not the main factor at play here.

“The challenge that foodservice providers have is the very nature of their business model. Fast-food chains such as McDonald’s and KFC often have complicated agreements with their outlets as a large proportion of them are franchises and are not enterprises. So it becomes a much more challenging negotiation to completely stop operations compared to other industries.”

A GlobalData consumer survey released in March showed consumer concern for social causes however.

“As 72% of consumer purchases are driven by a brand’s ethics or support shown toward a social cause it becomes difficult for these companies to balance consumer expectations and their operational needs putting pressure on international fast-food restaurants” Mr. Baghdadi said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0aWVzL2x1Y2tub3ctbmV3cy9ycy0xLTAwMC1jci1wZXBzaWNvLXBsYW50LXRvLWNvbWUtdXAtYXQtbmFpbmktaW4tdS1wLXMtcHJheWFncmFqLW1pbmlzdGVyLTEwMTY2MjMxNDQyMDAyOS5odG1s0gGVAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXRpZXMvbHVja25vdy1uZXdzL3JzLTEtMDAwLWNyLXBlcHNpY28tcGxhbnQtdG8tY29tZS11cC1hdC1uYWluaS1pbi11LXAtcy1wcmF5YWdyYWotbWluaXN0ZXItMTAxNjYyMzE0NDIwMDI5LWFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,₹1000 cr PepsiCo plant to come up at Naini in U.P.’s Prayagraj: Minister,"As part of the state government’s efforts to revive and develop Naini Industrial Area of Prayagraj Varun Beverages—the second largest bottling company of PepsiCo’s beverages in the world outside the USA—will soon set up its plant in Saraswati Hi-Tech City in Naini said U.P. minister for industrial development export promotion NRI and investment promotion Nand Gopal Gupta ‘Nandi’.

Isha Ambani daughter of Reliance chief Mukesh Ambani is handling the responsibility of returning Campa Cola to the market. In this sector the Ambani family will compete with Coca-Cola and PepsiCo with the Campa Cola brand.

Reliance Industries is ready to make a comeback in the Indian soft drink market by making a comeback of an old brand. Reliance chief Mukesh Ambani has made preparations to launch soft drinks in the market through Reliance Retail. To carry out this new campaign Reliance Industries has acquired Campa Cola the famous soft drink brand of the 70s. Reliance’s move will give a tough competition to beverage makers like Pepsi Coca Cola and Sprite.

Mukesh Ambani’s company Reliance Retail has taken the responsibility of returning the brand Campa Cola which has been missing from the market for years. Isha Ambani-led Reliance Retail is all set to re-establish the Campa Cola brand in the market. The company is preparing to launch its three flavors on this Diwali. Reliance has bought the rights to the Campa Cola brand from Delhi-based Pure Drinks Group for around Rs 22 crore. Let us tell you that in the year 1977 when the Janata Party government banned Coca-Cola in the country and showed the company the way to the market from the country Campa Cola had fulfilled the shortage of Coca-Cola. The brand gradually disappeared from the country after the return of Coca-Cola to the country. Now once again Reliance is bringing this brand back in the market. PLC/GT"

A public comment period is open until Sept. 12 on Pfizer’s request to increase its groundwater withdrawal by up to 4.32 million gallons per-day which the company says is needed to support manufacturing operations at its expanding campus.

Regulators say the increase would bring Pfizer’s annual Michigan groundwater use to roughly 6.5 billion gallons-per-year which is less than what the facility at 7171 Portage Road has pumped in the past.

About 99 percent of the increased withdrawal would be discharged to Upjohn Pond the company said in its application.

“It’s really not an increase in the amount of water they have pumped historically” said Andrew LeBaron a water use analyst at the Michigan Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE). “It’s more to pick up the slack.”

LeBaron said the requested increase would offset declining production from older wells at the company’s facility and meet needs associated with facility expansion.

Pfizer a multinational pharmaceutical and biotech company based in Manhattan is building a $120 million expansion of its Portage campus this year to increase production of its oral COVID-19 treatment pill Paxlovid. The company also spent $450 million expanding the facility in 2021 to build sterile injectable pharmaceuticals.

The facility where COVID vaccines are produced has received visits from Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2021 and this year and from U.S. President Joe Biden in 2021.

In 2020 Pfizer used 6.04 billion gallons of groundwater making it the largest industrial process groundwater user in Michigan.

The Carmeuse Lime calcite quarry near Rogers City which used 9 billion gallons in 2020 for mining pit dewatering is classified differently by the state. The St. Marys cement plant in Charlevoix used 4.7 billion groundwater gallons in 2020.

The state’s largest total industrial water users such as U.S. Steel in Detroit pull from the Great Lakes.

In Portage LeBaron said Pfizer has a standing baseline capacity of about 14.5 billion gallons-per-year; a grandfathered withdrawal level which preceded 2006 changes in state water use law. The company’s peak use was around the year 2000 at roughly 11 billion gallons-per-year.

The new increase would have “limited potential” to affect surface water bodies or surrounding water supplies according to the company’s consultant report.

The underlying aquifer is not entirely confined and includes some clay layers that impede connectivity between deeper and shallower groundwater LeBaron said.

Pfizer’s wells would pull from about 175 feet deep.

Michigan law allows property owners to use groundwater absent any fees royalties or major restrictions as long as the pumping doesn’t harm the environment or affect nearby users.

The city of Portage operates nearby municipal drinking water wells which LeBaron said are close enough to Pfizer’s that there’s likely impact in both directions.

“They are close enough to where there’s likely some interference going on between the wells both for the city of Portage and some impact on Pfizer’s well” he said.

The city is not concerned.

“The city of Portage has a terrific working relationship with Pfizer and views the firm as one of our premier community partners” said Portage spokeswoman Mary Beth Block. “The proposed water project is still in the early permitting phases. While additional testing is necessary it is believed that Pfizer’s application will be successful. The city of Portage draws water from two aquifers. The design will be rigorously tested with the involvement of engineers from Pfizer and the city of Portage to ensure no adverse impact on the city’s water system.”

Pfizer said actual withdrawal is expected to be lower than requested levels.

“Pfizer is committed to the responsible use of water resources” said company spokeswoman Julia Cohen.

“Our Kalamazoo facility is an example of Pfizer’s commitment where we have been continuously improving and upgrading our utility infrastructure to improve performance reliability and environmental sustainability. We recently applied for permits to bring online two new production wells as outlined in the water withdrawal permit application referenced below. The output of these wells will increase our site’s potential maximum withdrawal capacity however the purpose of their installation is to support scheduled upgrades and replacement of facility water production infrastructure and actual site withdrawal is anticipated to continue at consistently lower levels. Our evaluation indicates that over 99 percent of water withdrawn will be returned to local watersheds. The remaining one percent of water withdrawn from the wells may be lost to evaporation and manufacturing.”

LeBaron said the state has not receive any public comments on the Pfizer application and would not hold a public hearing unless one is requested.

The regulator confirmed on Saturday that Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine had met its standards of safety quality and effectiveness and had been approved for the UK autumn booster programme.

The vaccine which targets the original variant of coronavirus and the Omicron variant that emerged at the end of 2021 follows the approval of a similar booster from Moderna in August.

The decision to approve the vaccine was based on data from a clinical trial which showed that a booster dose with the bivalent Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine triggers a strong immune response against Omicron and the original strain.

Throughout the trial safety monitoring of side-effects observed showed they were the same as those seen for the original Pfizer/BioNTech booster dose and were typically mild and self-resolving with no new serious safety concerns identified.

Dr June Raine the MHRA chief executive said: “I am pleased to announce that we now have a second approved vaccine for the UK autumn booster programme. The clinical trial of the Pfizer/BioNTech bivalent vaccine showed a strong immune response against the Omicron BA.1 variant as well as the original strain.

“Bivalent vaccines are helping us to meet the challenge of an ever-evolving virus to help protect people against Covid-19 variants.”

Pfizer’s UK country president Susan Rienow said: “We are delighted with today’s approval by the MHRA of Pfizer/BioNTech’s Omicron BA.1-adapted bivalent Covid-19 vaccine.

“We have been following the science since the beginning of the pandemic and are pleased to be able to provide the National Health Service with another tool in the armoury.

“We have been manufacturing the new vaccine at risk (ahead of approval being granted) and doses will be shipped immediately for use in the autumn booster programme to help protect people in the UK this winter season.”

Prof Wei Shen Lim the chair of Covid-19 immunisation on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said: “It is very encouraging that more vaccines continue to become available and we now have another option to add to the vaccines already advised for the autumn booster campaign.”

The updated booster vaccine made by Pfizer/BioNTech targeting two coronavirus variants has been approved for use in individuals aged 12 years and above. This decision has been endorsed by the Commission on Human Medicines after a careful review of the evidence.

In each dose of the booster vaccine ‘Comirnaty bivalent Original/Omicron’ half of the vaccine (15 micrograms) targets the original virus strain and the other half (15 micrograms) targets Omicron (BA.1).

The MHRA’s decision is based on data from a clinical trial which showed that a booster dose with the bivalent Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine triggers a strong immune response against both Omicron and the original strain. Safety monitoring showed that the side effects observed were the same as those seen for the original Pfizer/BioNTech booster dose and were typically mild and self-resolving and no new serious safety concerns were identified.

We have in place a comprehensive safety surveillance strategy for all UK-approved COVID-19 vaccines and this will include the updated booster we approved today.

Professor Sir Munir Pirmohamed Chair of the Commission on Human Medicines said:

Following an independent review of the safety quality and effectiveness of the vaccine the Commission on Human Medicines and its COVID-19 Vaccines Expert Working Group supports the MHRA’s decision. As with any medicinal product including vaccines it is important to continually monitor effectiveness and safety when it is deployed and we have the relevant processes and expertise in this country to do that. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) will advise on how this vaccine should be offered as part of the deployment programme.

Inadequate support: Pathology experts pointed out that Burkhard’s analyses contain a poor description of his methods making it impossible to draw any conclusions from these data.

Misrepresents source: mRNA from COVID-19 vaccines remains mostly at the injection site and no evidence suggests it integrates into the cell’s genome. Such claims result from a misinterpretation of a biodistribution study in rats conducted by Pfizer and a study by Lund University researchers respectively. KEY TAKE AWAY Before receiving marketing authorization COVID-19 vaccines demonstrated their safety and effectiveness through several stages of clinical trials. However regulatory agencies and health authorities continue to monitor possible safety issues among vaccinated people to identify any potential rare effect. There is an overwhelming body of evidence indicating that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination continue to outweigh the known and potential risks and serious reactions after vaccination are rare.

FULL CLAIM: mRNA vaccines “travel throughout the body and accumulate in various organs”; they induce “long-lasting expression of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein” that can lead to “autoimmune-like inflammation” and cause vascular organ damage “sometimes with deadly outcome”

REVIEW

On 19 August 2022 an article titled “Vascular and organ damage induced by mRNA vaccines: irrefutable proof of causality” went viral on Twitter. Authored by chemistry professor Michael Palmer and retired microbiologist Sucharit Bhakdi the article was posted on the website of the group “Doctors for COVID Ethics”. The article received some engagement through Instagram but it was widely shared on Twitter (see examples here here and here) where it received more than 25000 interactions according to the social media analytics tool CrowdTangle.

In the article the authors claimed to demonstrate a mechanism by which COVID-19 vaccines cause deaths in vaccinated people and called for the vaccination to be stopped. The authors based their conclusions on two main arguments. The first one is that the vaccines distribute throughout the body inducing “long-lasting expression of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in many organs”. The second one is that the spike protein produced through vaccination causes “autoimmune-like inflammation” leading to “grave organ damage especially in vessels”.

However the “irrefutable proof” that the authors claimed to present doesn’t support their claims. Instead the entire article relies on misinterpreted scientific studies and flawed analyses that contradict available scientific evidence as we will explain below.

Who are the authors and the publisher of the article?

The two authors of the article have a history of spreading misinformation about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Bhakdi’s false but widespread claims that the COVID-19 pandemic was “fake” and that vaccines would “decimate” the world population have been debunked by multiple organizations including Lead Stories USA Today and Africa Check.

In September 2020 Palmer distributed a course outline to students at the University of Waterloo that called COVID-19 a “fake emergency”. This led the Dean of Science at the university to make a statement on CBC News a Canadian television and radio channel that Palmer’s opinion was “not however shared by the University of Waterloo or the Faculty of Science.”

Palmer and Bhakdi are founding signatories of the group Doctors for COVID Ethics. According to Annie Lab a fact-checking project by the University of Hong Kong and the Asian Network of News & Information Educators the group has been spreading misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines since early 2021. The Virality Project—a coalition of six U.S. research entities tackling COVID-19 vaccine misinformation—described this group as “repeat offenders” who “use their medical credentials to further doubts about COVID-19 vaccines”.

Only a tiny fraction of the lipid nanoparticles in COVID-19 vaccines travel through the body; the injection site retains most of it

Palmer and Bhakdi cited biodistribution data submitted by Pfizer to Japan’s regulatory body Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) to support the claim that “the vaccine quickly distributes through the body”. However this is misleading because Pfizer’s data actually showed that the majority of the lipid nanoparticles remained on the injection site and only a tiny fraction traveled to other tissues.

Pfizer’s researchers evaluated how the vaccine would distribute throughout the body’s organs and tissues by injecting rats with lipid nanoparticles identical to the ones that enclose the mRNA in the COVID-19 vaccine. The nanoparticles used in the study carried a radioactive label that allowed the researchers to estimate the amount of nanoparticles present in each tissue at different times by measuring the level of radioactivity.

As Health Feedback explained in an earlier review pages 5 and 6 of the technical document submitted by Pfizer show that most of the lipid nanoparticles administered (52.6%) remained at the injection site at one hour post-injection and 18.1% went to the liver at eight hours post-injection. Contrary to what the article suggested the amount of nanoparticles in the rest of the tissues didn’t exceed 1% of the administered dose and in most cases was below 0.1% even though the dose used in rats was much higher than that used in COVID-19 vaccines.

The main body of evidence in the article relies on data that has been questioned by experts

Palmer and Bhakdi acknowledged that most of the evidence presented in the article is based on data from retired pathologist Arne Burkhardt. These data consist of a series of histopathological analyses—examination of tissue under the microscope to study the changes caused by a disease—on 15 people (eight women and seven men aged 28 to 95) who died within six months after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.

Burkhardt found an accumulation of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) in several organ tissues which he interpreted as an ”attack” of the body organs by the immune system caused by COVID-19 vaccination.

This isn’t the first time that Burkhardt has made these claims. The first public record dates back to 20 September 2021 at a “Pathology Conference” organized by Burkhardt himself former professor of electrical engineering Werner Bergholz and retired pathologist Walter Lang at the Pathological Institute of Reutlingen Germany. On 10 December 2021 Bhakdi and Burkhardt repeated the same claims (summarized in this four-page report) in a live-streamed “Doctors for COVID Ethics Symposium”.

However Burkhardt’s data and conclusions have been heavily criticized by experts for being unsupported by evidence.

The team of the German register of COVID-19 autopsies at the University Hospital RWTH Aachen supported by the Federal Ministry of Health told the fact-checking organization Correctiv that Burkhard had misinterpreted the images. They explained that the accumulation of lymphocytes was similar to “those found in many autopsy cases”. Furthermore they said that no conclusions could be drawn from Burkhardt’s data because the criteria for selecting the cases were “unclear” the entire methodology incomprehensible and there was a lack of relevant clinical information.

The German Society for Pathology (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Pathologie) issued a statement distancing itself “sharply” from the conference and its content (translated into English from the original German):

“These are personal opinions and not the position of our professional society. As already critically noted by others the data presented are not scientifically sound. So far the [Deutsche Gesellschaft für Pathologie] is not aware of any striking correlation of deaths associated with the COVID-19 vaccine – although of course the possibility that the vaccine may also cause complications cannot be excluded”.

The Federal Association of German Pathologists (Bundesverband Deutscher Pathologen) made a similar statement in an email to Correctiv (translated into English from the original German):

“As far as we know the opinions presented in the video by Professor Burkhardt and Professor Lang are currently neither sufficiently supported by scientific evidence nor are they available in a format worthy of comment.”

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that despite being “under the most intense safety monitoring program in U.S. history” reports of death following COVID-19 vaccination are rare. Furthermore these reports don’t necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem as Health Feedback explained in several earlier reviews. Data from safety monitoring indicates that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and severe reactions after vaccination are rare.

No evidence indicates that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines cause “long-lasting expression” of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

Palmer and Bhakdi explained the alleged damage of the COVID-19 vaccines to organs by hypothesizing that the mRNA from vaccines remains active in the body producing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 perpetually.

To support their hypothesis the authors cited a study by researchers at Lund University[1]. Palmer and Bhakdi claimed that this study showed that “human-derived cells can copy the Pfizer mRNA vaccine into DNA and then insert it into their own chromosomal DNA”. They added that this DNA insertion poses a risk of genetic damage leading to cancers and leukemias.

However this is inaccurate. As Health Feedback explained in an earlier review the cited study didn’t show that the mRNA alters our DNA. Instead it showed that liver cancer cells treated in the laboratory with varying amounts of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine produced more LINE-1 and at least partial DNA copies of the vaccine mRNA. LINE-1 is the element that encodes for an enzyme called reverse transcriptase which enables the production of DNA from RNA.

Based on their results the authors of the study suggested that the vaccine could potentially affect the integrity of the human genome. However the study never showed that the reverse-transcribed DNA entered the nucleus where the DNA is stored nor that it integrated into the cell’s genome. Furthermore the study’s results cannot be extrapolated to people because cancer cells growing in the laboratory aren’t representative of healthy cells in a human being.

The idea that mRNA from COVID-19 vaccines can remain in our bodies in the long term is a common myth with no scientific basis. mRNA COVID-19 vaccines deliver the genetic instructions to the muscle cells to produce the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Thus they train our immune system to recognize and respond more rapidly to the virus if it encounters the virus in the future. However it is the response from the trained immune system which confers protection against the virus not the vaccine itself.

mRNA from vaccines is fragile and gets rapidly degraded by cellular machinery once it has delivered the genetic instructions. The spike protein generated by COVID-19 vaccines is thought to remain in the body for up to a few weeks like other proteins made by the body.

Conclusion

Nothing in the article by Palmer and Bhakdi demonstrates that COVID-19 vaccines are causally associated with deaths. All the evidence presented is based on misinterpreted results from studies and on poorly-described histopathological analyses of tissue from deceased people that can’t be considered reliable. In contrast rigorous analyses of safety monitoring data show that COVID-19 vaccines have a high safety profile.

San Antonio Spurs center Victor Wembanyama is reportedly ""intrigued"" by the idea of playing with Atlanta Hawks guard Trae Young.

""I will say I have talked to people who know Wemby who have indicated he is at least intrigued by the idea"" ESPN's Tim MacMahon said on the Hoop Collective (39:13 mark). ""Now intrigued by that idea and pounding the table are two very different things. I have no idea whether Gregg Popovich would be intrigued by the idea.""

San Antonio has been regularly mentioned as a potential suitor should the Hawks choose to trade Young who seems to have plateaued as the 1A option in Atlanta. Young averaged 25.7 points and 10.8 assists per game this season—his second straight 25-10 campaign—but the Hawks failed to make the playoffs for the first time since 2020.

The calculus may have changed in both Atlanta and San Antonio on Sunday with both teams coming away lottery winners. The Spurs will have picks Nos. 4 and 8 in the lottery after the Toronto Raptors' first-round pick was conveyed while the Hawks shocked the world to win the lottery.

Both teams face intriguing decisions on how to handle the draft over the next month. ESPN's Zach Lowe noted Atlanta faces a crossroads of sorts as it explores whether to trade the No. 1 pick for a veteran and continue building around Young and Dejounte Murray or make the pick and continue exploring their trade options with the two guards.

The Spurs are armed with cap space and a generational building block in Wembanyama who finished second in Defensive Player of the Year voting and won Rookie of the Year in 2023-24. It's possible they could look to kickstart their rebuild by floating one of those picks for a veteran who fits within Wembanyama's timeline.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9uMy5jb20vbmV3cy80LXN0YXItcGcta2luZy1ncmFjZS11cGRhdGVzLXJlY3J1aXRtZW50LXRhbGtzLWxzdS1taXNzaXNzaXBwaS1zdGF0ZS1zbXUtYW5kLXRjdS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4-star PG King Grace updates recruitment talks LSU Mississippi State SMU and TCU,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi2AFodHRwczovL25ld3MucGcuY29tL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvbmV3cy1kZXRhaWxzLzIwMjQvUHJvY3Rlci0tR2FtYmxlLVJlY2FsbHMtOC4yLU1pbGxpb24tRGVmZWN0aXZlLUJhZ3Mtb2YtVGlkZS1HYWluLUFjZS1hbmQtQXJpZWwtTGF1bmRyeS1EZXRlcmdlbnQtUGFja2V0cy1EaXN0cmlidXRlZC1pbi1VUy1EdWUtdG8tUmlzay1vZi1TZXJpb3VzLUluanVyeS9kZWZhdWx0LmFzcHjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Procter & Gamble Recalls 8.2 Million Defective Bags of Tide Gain Ace and Ariel Laundry Detergent Packets ...,"Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) today announced a voluntary packaging recall of Tide Pods Gain Flings Ace Pods and Ariel Pods liquid laundry detergent packets packaged in flexible film bags.

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNzcG9ydHMuY29tL2NvbGxlZ2UtYmFza2V0YmFsbC9uZXdzL2plcmVteS1yb2FjaC1lbnRlcnMtdHJhbnNmZXItcG9ydGFsLWR1a2UtcGctYWxzby1kZWNsYXJlcy1mb3ItbmJhLWRyYWZ0LWJ1dC13aWxsLXJldGFpbi1lbGlnaWJpbGl0eS_SAZoBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2Jzc3BvcnRzLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlLWJhc2tldGJhbGwvbmV3cy9qZXJlbXktcm9hY2gtZW50ZXJzLXRyYW5zZmVyLXBvcnRhbC1kdWtlLXBnLWFsc28tZGVjbGFyZXMtZm9yLW5iYS1kcmFmdC1idXQtd2lsbC1yZXRhaW4tZWxpZ2liaWxpdHkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jeremy Roach enters transfer portal: Duke PG also declares for NBA Draft but will retain eligibility,"Duke point guard Jeremy Roach announced Tuesday on social media that he is entering the transfer portal after four seasons with the Blue Devils. The 6-foot-1 former five-star prospect started 108 games across the coaching tenures of both Mike Krzyzewski and Jon Scheyer while playing a pivotal role during a time of transition for the program.

With sophomore guard Caleb Foster and junior guard Tyrese Proctor returning the Blue Devils are equipped to withstand Roach's departure. But it would still make sense for Duke to add another guard through the portal after also losing Jared McCain to the NBA Draft. Several perimeter weapons are arriving as part of the nation's No. 1 ranked recruiting class which includes dynamic forward Cooper Flagg. But none of the six commitments project as prototypical on-ball guards.

Roach will have one season left to play as he uses the bonus year of eligibility provided to players amid the COVID-19 pandemic. He will be one of the top point guards available during the 2024 transfer cycle after earning third-team All-ACC honors for the 2023-24 season. The Leesburg Virginia native averaged 14 points and 3.3 assists on 42.9% 3-point shooting in 32.7 minutes per game.

His career at Duke featured its share of ups and downs. Among the peaks was Roach's performance in 2022 NCAA Tournament victories over Michigan State and Texas Tech as he scored 15 points on efficient shooting numbers in each game while helping the Blue Devils reach the Final Four in Krzyzewski's final season as coach."

I loved it. But something didn’t click. In the lab I was clumsy nervous and honestly a bit terrified of some of the experiments which variously involved chemicals that could burn you blind you or turn you radioactive. But although I may not have been cut out for a career at the laboratory bench I never lost my fascination with scientific research and its power in helping us understand the processes that drive all living things.

When I joined the Bureau I quickly noticed the parallels between investigative journalism and academic research. Like scientists investigative journalists work on a hypothesis-based approach. As Mark Lee Hunter and Luuk Sengers write “Every investigation begins with a question and a hypothesis is a provisional answer to that question.”

Just as a researcher in a lab conducts experiments and analyses the results a journalist undertakes reporting to uncover information. This is not about collecting the evidence to support your hypothesis but collecting evidence weighing it up and testing it to see whether it supports the hypothesis.

Whatever the investigation we collaborate and work closely with experts in different fields – people who are open and generous with their time experience and knowledge. And we make use of data and work that others have done.

For one Big Tobacco investigation we published recently though evidence was thin on the ground. We couldn’t find many scientific papers on the topic that were independent of the tobacco industry. So we got together to discuss how we might get the data we needed. Could we do this testing ourselves?",,,,,,,,,,,,

The project is being spearheaded by Bluewater Texas Terminal a joint venture between Phillips 66 and Trafigur and would be the first large oil export facility off the coast of Texas.

The planned facilities would make possible the loading of Very Large Crude Carriers — tankers that can move as much as 2 million barrels of crude oil per vessel — and thus have the capability of exporting up to 384 million barrels of crude oil per year.

Whether Bluewater Texas Terminal will proceed forward or revise its permits is still to be determined. Rich Johnson a spokesman for Phillips 66 said officials are “in the process of reviewing” the EPA’s comments.

The EPA in the Sept. 1 letter said the Bluewater Texas Terminal would have the opportunity to withdraw its applications by Sept. 15 in order to then submit a revised proposal that meets the more stringent pollution control standards.

If the joint venture does withdraw and revise its permit applications the EPA will proceed with “completing a response to comments and issue a final permit decision based upon the current administrative record” the letter reads.

The terminal would have been permitted to emit up to nearly 19000 tons of Volatile Organic Compounds which the EPA states play a role in the formation of ozone and fine particulates in the atmosphere under the original proposal.

The EPA said standards set by the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for marine tank vessel loading operations should apply to the proposed project meaning it would be required to reduce “Hazardous Air Pollutants emissions by 95 weight-percent” the letter reads.

“We are relieved that EPA listened to the public came to its senses and decided that this ridiculous project needs pollution controls after all” said Gabriel Clark-Leach an attorney for the Environmental Integrity Project which objected to the permit in a news release. “EPA’s regulations require marine vessel loading operations — like the Bluewater port — to reduce toxic air pollution by 95%. The application of this rule will reduce the amount of pollution the Bluewater terminal will emit by a whopping 18000 tons each year.”

Critics of the project have said it would endanger the surrounding habitats while company officials have said environmental impacts would be minimized.

The Sept. 1 letter marks a reversal from decisions made by the EPA while it was overseen by the Trump administration. Then the EPA decided the terminal would be exempt from rules that require pollution controls on marine tank vessel loading operations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYXBhdmFsbGV5cmVnaXN0ZXIvbmFtZS9sYXJyeS1mb2VyZGVyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2NDEzODg10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Larry Foerder Obituary (1941 - 2022) - Napa CA - Napa Valley Register,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/napavalleyregister/name/larry-foerder-obituary?id=36413885 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYXBhdmFsbGV5cmVnaXN0ZXIvbmFtZS9sYXJyeS1mb2VyZGVyLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM2NDEzODg10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vc3dpbXN3YW0uY29tL3N1bW1lci1uYXRpb25hbHMtcXVhbGlmaWVyLW5vYWgtc2VjaC12ZXJiYWxseS1jb21taXRzLXRvLXByaW5jZXRvbi1mb3ItMjAyMy0yNC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Summer Nationals Qualifier Noah Sech Verbally Commits to Princeton for 2023-24,"Fitter and Faster Swim Camps is the proud sponsor of SwimSwam’s College Recruiting Channel and all commitment news. For many swimming in college is a lifelong dream that is pursued with dedication and determination. Fitter and Faster is proud to honor these athletes and those who supported them on their journey.

Noah Sech from San Clemente California has announced his verbal commitment to the application process* at Princeton University. He will join the class of 2027 with Ethan Harrington Connor Buck Daniel Li and Parker Lenoce next fall.

He told SwimSwam:

“Academics and learning have always been as important to me as swimming. I was looking for a school that had a combination of excellent academics and a swim team with high aspirations. After meeting Matt and Abby and listening to their explanation of the team’s culture and goals Princeton became my top choice. I was elated when given the opportunity to verbally commit to the application process.”

Sech is a senior at San Clemente High School. He swims club with Mission Viejo Nadadores and has been on an absolute tear this year. Coming into the SCY season with only two Futures cuts (LCM 200 free and 400 IM) he competed at Carlsbad Sectionals and went best times in the 200 free (1:42.13) 500 free (4:38.08) 1000 free (9:46.15) 200 IM (1:51.49) and 400 IM (4:00.63). Then came high school season where he earned his first Summer and Winter Juniors cuts winning the 100 breast and 200 IM at the league championship meet and breaking school records with new PBs of 55.38 and 1:50.10. A few days later he placed 5th in the 100 breast (56.16) and 6th in the 200 IM (1:49.90) at CIF-SS Division I Championships. After California CIF State Championships where he came in 12th in the IM Sech swam at a series of meets in Southern California (Grand Challenge PSS Mission Viejo So Cal Invite – where he went a 1:02.93 PB in the 100 breast) eventually obtaining two Senior Nationals cuts. At Phillips 66 Nationals he finaled in the 100/200 breast and 400 IM and walked away with PBs in the 200 breast (2:17.22) 200 IM (2:06.02) and 400 IM (4:30.25).

Sech told SwimSwam that until 2021 he had focused mainly on 500 free and 200/400 IM. But in refining his breaststroke with Coach Jonny Dray he found a new main event. After his outstanding long course season Sech hopes to build on his success in SCY. So far his best times are:

100 breast – 55.38

200 IM – 1:49.90

400 IM – 4:00.63

100 free – 47.48

200 free – 1:42.13

500 free – 4:38.08

Sech is bilingual (English/Spanish) plays the piano and loves to surf. When he is not swimming himself he is on the sidelines cheering for his nine-year-old sister “who just completed her first Summer Junior Olympics and dropped time in all of her events!”

Leading into World War I the world had seen a period of peace which led to an arms race and an eagerness to go to war. West Virginia and Pitt haven't squared off on the gridiron since 2011 and the two fanbases had an eagerness to go to war.

To say there was no love lost in the Backyard Brawl might be the understatement of the century. And to say it was a good game may be the understatement of the year.

The Revivalry!

No Love Lost

I'll jump straight to the chase– these two fanbases have an intense hatred that boiled over into incivility. It's impossible to talk about the 2022 Backyard Brawl without talking about the appalling chants from both fanbases and the downright distasteful and intolerant insults hurled back and forth.

And I say that having been to many rivalries. Some of the fans' disdain for each other was way way past the line of a fun rivalry.

Alright that's out of the way. Now for the good stuff.

The revival of the Backyard Brawl was hotly anticipated all offseason; despite West Virginia coming into this game unranked it was a pinnacle of Week 1. The grandeur and excitement surrounding the matchup could be felt from the minute you stepped out of the car.

Pitt's student section was a third full well over two hours before kickoff. They were excited and disruptive all night long.

There was a constant battle of chants between the two teams which made for a truly collegiate atmosphere despite Pitt playing their home games in a professional football stadium. The chants– not all vulgar and suggesting that the other fans have uh relations with relatives– were truly thunderous.

But when it came down to it the fans in the stands hated each other more than the players on the field. And I mean Hate with a capital ""H.""

All The Bells And Whistles

Pittsburgh knew what this game would bring to the city. The Steel City brought out the big guns as far as pregame entertainment goes highlighted by the Pittsburgh Rib Festival. I jumped on the opportunity to grab Bad Azz BBQ who was the 2021 Rib Festival champions (and many many other champions).

Talk about a way to start a game day.

Speaking of game day College GameDay was on-site for a special one-hour show from inside the stadium. Keen fans who got inside the stadium early got a chance to be up front for the special.

While Ohio State is known for their tradition of dotting the ""i"" this is a tradition shared by Pittsburgh. However it's not quite the spectacle of Columbus' iteration it's more of a chance to recognize donors and special alumni.

Just before halftime Pitt legend and Steelers rookie Kenny Pickett along with a few teammates unveiled the Panthers' 2021 ACC Championship banner. Pickett is beloved by the city of Pittsburgh and has the inside route to become one of their favorite sons.

Penn State may be the more famous school for ""Sweet Caroline"" but in-state rival Pitt offers a hearty rendition heading into the fourth quarter as well.

To top it off this game was played in front of 70622 fans a record for a Pittsburgh sporting event– professional college or otherwise.

#17 Pittsburgh 38 West Virginia 31

The game lived up to the hype. While both teams had their Week 1 frustrations– particularly from both QBs– the Backyard Brawl turned into a true thriller at the end.

A pair of USC transfers took the field on opposite sides: JT Daniels (West Virginia) and Kedon Slovis (Pittsburgh). Daniels looked polished although he didn't pop off the field while Slovis showed playmaking ability but also a tendency to take really really bad sacks.

The real drama began with just under four minutes left in the game. Pitt trailed 31-24 with seemingly no offensive traction and no shot at winning the game (ESPN had West Virginia's win probability at 89%). Running back Israel Abanikanda hauled in a pass and ripped through a few tackles en route to a thrilling 24-yard TD to tie the game up.

The following possession Daniels threw a pass to his receiver and it went right through his arms and into the lap of Pitt's M.J. Devonshire. Devonshire proceeded to take the pick back 56 yards for the go-ahead TD.

Acrisure Stadium nearly collapsed in on itself from the eruption of the crowd.

A truly unbelievable finish.

Game Day Grades

Stadium: C-. I don't like college football played in NFL stadiums. While the atmosphere masked the feeling of a pro stadium for the most part I still don't like it. As an NFL stadium much higher. The view of the Pittsburgh skyline and the tri-river area is just incredible.

Tradition: A. This is more of a grade on the tradition of the Backyard Brawl rather than Pitt football itself. This game was first played in 1896 and ran for over 100 years. Pitt is also one of the oldest college football teams in the nation.

Atmosphere: A. It was tense exciting and explosive. A true hateful rivalry.

Tailgating: B. Tailgating felt like pro tailgating to me weaved in and out of the urban streets of Pittsburgh. It wasn't overwhelming though I'm sure there were plenty more tents than I was able to see.

Fans: I'm afraid to give a grade here. The fans hurling truly hateful insults get an F from me; I don't say it lightly when I say it was some of the most low-brow behavior I've ever seen from college football fans.

On the complete opposite end of the spectrum I sat among several season ticket holders. They've been sitting in section 537 for 22 years running. Those fans made the game day amazing. Thank you to y'all and that sector of the fandom deserves an A+.

Extracurriculars: B. I was really impressed with the Rib Festival and pregame festivities. However with a typical Pitt game day you don't have those. Pittsburgh is a terrific city though downtown and the cultural district are a ways away from the stadium.

A Skadden team entered the case on Aug. 15 filing a motion to prevent in-house lawyers for Meta which owns the social media platforms Facebook and Instagram from viewing highly confidential information TikTok produces pursuant to a subpoena in the FTC case. The filing noted that TikTok’s attorneys were negotiating with Meta to narrow the scope of the subpoena.

Meta has identified TikTok as a major competitor as it seeks to fend off the FTC’s allegations.

The TikTok team included Skadden partners Steven Sunshine David Wales and Julia York. Sunshine the head of the firm’s global antitrust and competition group is ranked among the top antitrust lawyers in the country. He has represented Apple in discovery disputes in the U.S. Justice Department’s monopoly case against Google.

In an effort to close the racial homeownership gap the Community Affordable Loan Solution will launch in markets with predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods including Charlotte Dallas Detroit Los Angeles and Miami and may later expand to other cities. It will not require a minimum credit score and will instead consider other factors for eligibility.

Is Bank of America's new zero-down mortgage worth it?

Home buying is a notoriously expensive process and has gotten even more costly as property values have increased over the years. When you consider a modest 5% down payment lender fees which can run you up to 1% of the home's value and closing costs which can be as high as 6% of the loan's value buyers can pay close to $46800 upfront for a $400000 home — this still excludes other charges like the underwriting fee title check home inspection and appraisal fees. Offering a loan that doesn't require a down payment mortgage insurance or closing costs could lower the barrier to entry for homeownership. And when you spend less money on down payment and closing costs you can reserve more of your savings for paying for serious home repairs that need to be taken care of or emergency expenses that could arise as soon as you move in. Just keep in mind though that making no down payment means that your home loan will cover the entire value of the property and your monthly payments can be higher than they'd be if you paid a little upfront. You'll need to work with a financial planner or mortgage lender to make sure that the monthly payments will fit into your budget.

Who will be eligible?

While the goal of the program is to bring Black and Hispanic borrowers closer to homeownership people of all races can qualify for the Community Affordable Loan Solution. Eligibility will be based on income and the location of the property. It will also use credit guidelines based on factors such as timely rent utility bill phone and auto insurance payments to determine creditworthiness though there is no minimum credit score requirement. If you're interested in applying for a loan through this program you must also complete a homebuyer certification course provided by select Bank of America and HUD-approved housing counseling partners before submitting your loan application. ""Our community affordable loan solution will help make the dream of sustained homeownership attainable for more Black and Hispanic families and it is part of our broader commitment to the communities that we serve"" AJ Barkley head of neighborhood and community lending at Bank of America said in a statement.

Six-time NTT INDYCAR SERIES champion Dixon put himself in position to win his record-tying seventh series championship – that would equal A.J. Foyt’s career mark – at this weekend’s season-ending Firestone Grand Prix of Monterey at WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca.

From starting 16th to finish third in this race to third in the standings with one race to go. That’s what Dixon seems to do year after year.

Dixon and Josef Newgarden trail series leader Will Power by 20 points with Newgarden keeping second by virtue of his five wins to Dixon’s two. Power can secure his second series title by finishing third or better at Laguna Seca but as so often happens Dixon is lurking like the tiger he is late in so many seasons.

This is the 11th time in the veteran driver’s 21 years in the series that he will go to the final race with a chance to win the championship. That’s remarkable especially after overcoming a poor qualifying effort in this one.

“We’ve got to stop getting these ‘most improved’ in races” Dixon said. “It’s simply frustrating.

“In qualifying we don’t know what happened. We were super quick on black (Firestone Firehawk tires) was second in our session and couldn’t (advance to the second round). So that was tough.

“Starting 16th with the competition we have now and no real cautions (in this race) we had to drive through the field today. But we’re still in the fight.”

Dixon’s signature move Sunday was capitalizing on a battle between Josef Newgarden and Alexander Rossi in Turn 2 following the race’s only restart on Lap 88. A few corners later Dixon had the opportunity to pass Pato O’Ward for third place after O’Ward got caught in a damaging fight with Power for second. O’Ward blocked Dixon and race control ordered O’Ward to give Dixon the position.

“That restart was vintage Dixon” longtime friend and former teammate Dario Franchitti said with a big smile.

Dixon said he knew Newgarden “had gone in deep” and that was his chance to pounce.

“He carried the corner through with (Rossi) and that enabled us to get both” he said. “We tried as hard as possible on that last one.”

Now Dixon and his No. 9 PNC Bank Chip Ganassi Racing Honda head to Laguna Seca a place where Chip Ganassi Racing tested last week with all four cars. He finished third there last year 10 positions ahead of Power and two ahead of Newgarden.

“Anything is possible” Dixon said. “We’ve seen it. We’ve won (championships) on tiebreakers before.

“We’re in it and we will never give up as a team until it’s over. It’s going to be an interesting one. It’s pretty tight I think between three or four cars and ultimately if we can be there we’ll try everything we can do.”

Title Contender Nuggets

Remember this moment: On the pit stop exchange at Lap 48 Power collected a bonus point for leading a lap in the No. 12 Verizon Team Penske Chevrolet even though he wasn’t the leader.

Scott McLaughlin had the lead in the No. 3 Freightliner Team Penske Chevrolet but his pit box was in front of the start/finish line; Power drove past McLaughlin and the scoring line to his pit box then came out of the pits behind McLaughlin. Nonetheless it was a point toward Power’s ledger.

McLaughlin secured the two bonus points for leading the most laps in the race by Lap 60. He will head to the season’s final race 41 points out of the series lead. He is one of five drivers mathematically eligible to win the title.

“It’s a shot” he said.

Lundgaard Slips Late in the Race

If the sign draped over Christian Lundgaard’s front wing late in Sunday’s race wasn’t bad enough having to watch David Malukas speed past his car in peril was.

Lundgaard’s No. 30 Mi-Jack Honda of Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing collected the sign after overshooting Turn 1 in an attempted pass of Andretti Autosport’s Rossi in the No. 27 NAPA AUTO PARTS/AutoNation Honda. The sign was placed in the runoff area as a deterrent to cutting the corner and Lundgaard couldn’t avoid it. Then he couldn’t shake it a situation compounded by the fact he had to drive most of the way around the 12-turn 1.964-mile permanent road course to get it removed.

It was a significant blow not only to Lundgaard’s chances for a strong result – he was running eighth at the time after starting third and scored as high as second – but also to his opportunity to win the Rookie of the Year award.

Lundgaard finished 21st seven positions behind Malukas in the No. 18 HMD Honda of Dale Coyne Racing with HMD. Lundgaard was the last car on the lead lap.

They two rookies head to the season finale separated by just five points. Lundgaard leads.

Daly’s Hot Shoulder

A wild sequence in the pits led to Conor Daly’s retirement from the race.

The crew of the No. 20 BitNile Chevrolet of Ed Carpenter Racing had trouble with the fueling and an abundance of it spilled over the back half of the car. A fire broke out.

The fire appeared to burn out as Daly drove down pit road but he wasn’t sure if it did without incident.

“I felt like it was in the cockpit” he said of the fire. “It was kind of nerve-wracking for a while. I said ‘I think my shoulder is like burning.’ But I could see the fire was going out so I was like ‘Well let’s keep going.’ I was hoping that science and wind would take care of the rest of it.”

The fire burned the clutch making it impossible to continue.

“Usually fire does damage so that’s what happened” he said.

Odds and Ends

Rinus VeeKay’s contact with Jimmie Johnson at the end of the front straightaway brought out the race’s first caution on Lap 84 of 110. The last time an INDYCAR race at Portland went flag to flag without stoppage was in 2007 when Sebastien Bourdais won.

Graham Rahal who finished fifth in the No. 15 Quartz Engine Oil Honda of Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing said he expects his wife Courtney to deliver their second child this week. Rahal’s race finish was his second-best of the season. He finished fourth in Toronto.

U.S. Olympian sprinter Fred Kerley a silver medalist in the 2021 Tokyo Games rode in the back seat of the Ruoff Mortgage Fastest Seat in Sports. The 27-year-old Texan did it right too screaming “whoo” and “yeah” with excitement during the pace lap. Kerley’s local tie was winning the 100-meter World Championships this summer in Eugene Oregon.

One of the programs will get credit cards to those without credit scores and the other will assist small businesses with minority women or veteran owners to get credit. Participation in Project REACh is a part of Citigroup’s $1 billion in strategic initiatives to help close the racial wealth gap and increase economic mobility in the United States according to the company’s press release.

Project REACh already works with several banks like JPMorgan Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp sharing bank account data to approve more borrowers for credit cards.

The issue of the credit-underserved is a big one in the U.S. with around 50 million residents lacking traditional credit scores. Banks usually look at credit scores when reviewing applications for various kinds of consumer debt.

The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) wrote that information about an applicant’s income and spending habits can be as good a measure of creditworthiness as traditional credit scores.

The areas of focus will include investing in community development financial institutions (CDFIs) and minority depository institutions (MDIs) supporting entrepreneurs and minority-owned businesses more access to credit and better infrastructure and housing for underserved neighborhoods.

Report of woman handing out money leads to bank robber's arrest

A 43-year-old woman was sentenced Friday to 63 months in federal prison for robbing a Denver bank less than a year ago.

Georgiana Jones's arrest was helped greatly by a tipster who told an undercover officer that a woman was ""handing out money"" to tenants at an East Colfax motel in the days following the robbery.

The woman bragged to those tenants as she passed out the money that she had recently robbed a bank according to the case's arrest affidavit.

Georgiana Jones credit: Denver Police Department

The robber entered the PNC Bank on northeast of the Cherry Creek shopping district at around 9 a.m. on October 25 2021.

The robber made inquiries to a teller about deposits left for half an hour then returned with a baseball cap and sunglasses.

The robber presented a note written on the deposit slip that the teller had provided minutes earlier.

The note stated ""Put all large bills and no tracers or die sticks immediately in bag. You have 20 seconds.""

The robber left the note at the bank. Investigators were able to compare the writing on the note to a letter Jones had written to a judge regarding a 2018 case in Denver. The handwriting particularly the loop around the 'G' and the fact every 'A' was capitalized ""appeared to match"" the Denver detective observed.

After the robbery Denver Police Department investigators gathered surveillance video from the area around the Westerner Motel located at 8405 E Colfax Avenue. In it they found images of Jones wearing the same distinctive jacket that the robber wore and driving the same black Audi which the robber drove to and from the bank.

They also found her driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee that she told a friend she had just purchased. That friend told detectives he wasn't aware of Jones having a job.

DPD also recorded bodycam video of Jones wearing the same jacket the night before the bank robbery when officers stopped a stolen vehicle.

Following Denver's arrest of Jones the case was handed over to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Colorado to prosecute. Bank robbery is a federal crime.

POOL,Pool Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyaWJ0b2RheS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDkvd2FkZGVsbC1wb29sLWRpdmVzLWludG8tdGhlLWFubmFscy1vZi1oaXN0b3J5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Waddell Pool dives into the annals of history,"NILES — The Waddell Pool is set to be demolished Tuesday morning after standing in Niles for 88 years. It closed in 2014 but still is remembered fondly by many members of the community.

The pool was dedicated July 25 1934 according to the Niles Historical Society. The ceremony was attended by 5000 people and about 750 were able to swim afterwards. The ceremony included a water pageant and a diving exhibition and the high school band played.

At the time it opened the historical society notes Niles had one of the most modern and largest civic pools in the state.

That first summer the pool was open from 9:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. The cost of entry was 20 cents for adults and 10 cents for children. By Sept. 16 when the pool closed that summer it had collected $1574.70 from 8325 children and 3711 adults. Free swimming was provided for 3816.

Swimmers were required to shower before entry and no smoking or rambunctious play was allowed. Bathing suits had to be clean and modest according to the historical society. Wearing swim trunks without a shirt was not allowed.

While the pool was enjoyed by many at the beginning it was not enjoyed equally. Black citizens were permitted to use the pool only on Monday mornings. According to the historical society in his memoirs Lou Tabors writes about how he convinced city administrators to let black residents use the facility equally as they also were taxpayers and deserved to have access to the facilities their money helped support.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE POOL

In the 1930s the federal government announced a public works program that offered to pay 30 percent of the costs for projects that would put people to work in the midst of the Great Depression. Under this program created through the National Recovery Act of 1933 Niles City Council applied for $40000 in funding for the pool and was awarded that amount according to the Niles Historical Society.

The land for the pool was donated to the city by Jacob D. Waddell in 1929 to be used as a park. In total he donated 52 acres. Waddell was the vice president of Empire Steel Corporation and later was the first director of the Mahoning Valley Sanitary District.

The historical society notes Waddell was hailed as “Niles’ Greatest Benefactor” for his generous gift. Many residents at the time hoped a pool would be added to the park and the funding from the federal government made that possible.

The first concrete was poured in February 1934 and work began as construction material arrived. The architects on the project were Ackley Bradey and Nelis from East Liverpool.

More information on the history of the pool and other Niles landmarks can be found at nileshistoricalsociety.org.

POOL CLOSURE

The Waddell Pool was closed in 2014 when the city couldn’t pay its lifeguards because of its fiscal emergency status. The facility has been unused since except for occasional storage.

In 2017 a study done by Phillips Sekanick Architects of all city-owned buildings — aimed at determining the status of and needed repairs for the structures — included the pool and park maintenance building. The study found a water pipe leak underneath the pool and roof leaks cracked walls and a damaged deck in the pool building.

The pool building and equipment have not been refurbished since the 1980s and the pumphouse in the pool building in particular has deteriorated since the pool was closed. In 2018 it was estimated the pool required $2.5 million in repairs to be safe to open.

While officials said it would be too costly to make these repairs the city is working on constructing a splash pad. Cortland Warren and McDonald all have popular splash pads. Groundbreaking on the splash pad should begin next year for the play area to open around July 4.

FOND MEMORIES

Several members of the community wrote in to share their memories of Waddell Pool:

“Our family grew up swimming at the pool every Fourth of July. My brother uncles and grandfather would go up to the park and sleep all night on the picnic tables so we had enough for the family” Kristina Gimma said. “We stayed and barbecued all day. It was the best childhood memory. Even my children went to the pool every weekend and they’re now 42 and 45 years old. What a shame my grandchildren don’t get to see and enjoy the pool.”

“This makes me so sad” Marci Ellwood said of the pool’s closing. “I spent hours and hours at this pool. We had paper routes and my dad would go to the Trib and get the papers early back when it was afternoon delivery. When we were done Dad dropped us off at the pool with 50 cents for a snack. One of the ticket ladies is now my sister-in-law. We stayed ALL day and were starved. Mom had dinner waiting for us. Then our grandson got to experience the pool as well.”

“I grew up in Niles in the ’50s and ’60s. I spent many of my childhood summers at Waddell Pool swimming with friends and family. Coming from a family of eight this was an affordable fun activity. It felt magical as a child” Michelle Piacquadio said. “We always knew we would be safe because there were hourly checks with everyone out of the pool and constant weather alerts. Our parents knew we would be safe and come home with smiles and exhausted from the hours of fun in the pool. I took my first swimming lessons at Waddell Pool. I can still smell the chlorine and suntan lotion and feel the warm sun on my skin. I consider myself lucky to have experienced Waddell Pool at its finest!”

“I remember having season passes along with my neighbors and their mom would take us down almost every day” Joe Burnham said. “It always felt like the entire community was there and we would go to each others’ blankets and visit when the lifeguards cleared the pool. We would start to get so impatient waiting to hear the whistle blow letting us know we could swim again. It seemed like we would all jump in simultaneously. I am so grateful to have those memories of the pool and my friends. I will cherish them forever.”

“My friends and I lived on the other side of Niles and would ride our bikes every Saturday and spend the day at the pool” Scott Belica said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzYWhpLmNvbS9hancvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTQ3MTAxMzfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Second reporter's death at NHK deemed as due to overwork | The Asahi Shimbun: Breaking News Japan News and ...,"Hanako Yasuho second from left a senior director at Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) and other company officials apologize at a Sept. 2 news conference. (Pool)

Japan’s grueling work culture is again under the spotlight after the death of a journalist at Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) due to overwork.

The man who was in his 40s died from what is termed “karoshi” in October 2019 according to NHK officials at a Sept. 2 news conference. He headed a team of reporters covering the Tokyo metropolitan government.

A younger reporter who worked in the same beat died from karoshi in 2013 prompting the public broadcaster to implement measures intended to provide counseling for those found to be putting in excessive overtime hours. But those steps failed to prevent the second death.

“We are gravely accepting the certification of a labor accident at the same workplace” Hanako Yasuho a senior director at NHK said at the news conference. “While we tried to take various measures clearly they were insufficient.”

The Shibuya Labor Standard Inspection Office in Tokyo certified in August that the male reporter’s death was work-related.

NHK officials said that in the five months before his death the reporter put in overtime in excess of the threshold for determining karoshi. The threshold is either 100 hours overtime a month or 80 hours overtime on average over the previous two to six months.

The man was found dead at home by family members.

In the month before his death the man clocked up about 74 hours of overtime but the five-month average came to 92 hours.

Toshio Horibe an NHK official explained that the reporter was busy covering the preparations for the Tokyo Olympics the Upper House election and damage to the Tokyo metropolitan area from a typhoon.

In 2013 Miwa Sado a 31-year-old reporter also covering the Tokyo metropolitan government died of congestive heart failure and the same labor standard office certified it as karoshi.

But NHK did not announce the death until four years later. Since 2017 NHK has increased the number of reporters covering the Tokyo metropolitan government and implemented rules regarding overtime and consultations with doctors.

The rules obliged the male reporter to see a doctor but he never did.

He was not alone. Only 4 percent of those working at NHK’s broadcasting center in Shibuya who were urged to see a doctor due to long work hours actually did so. The low figure led the labor standard office to call on NHK to improve the situation.

The bereaved family of the male reporter issued a statement through their lawyer urging NHK to revise its corporate culture to prevent a recurrence.

Sado’s father Mamoru said it appeared NHK learned nothing from his daughter’s death.

Hiroshi Kawahito a lawyer who has handled many karoshi cases said “While the ages of the reporters are different there are similarities in their situations.”

Noting that they were both deeply involved in election coverage prior to their deaths Kawahito asserted that “the same thing happened because no structural analysis was conducted.”

Overwork has long been an issue for those working in broadcasting newspapers advertising and other arms of the media industry.

In 2015 rookie employee Matsuri Takahashi 24 committed suicide after finding herself unable to cope with the grueling work hours at advertising giant Dentsu Inc.

The media industry was included in 2018 as one in which further studies should be conducted for individual karoshi cases.

The same year a survey by the labor ministry of 4280 workers in the media industry found 54.3 percent of respondents agreed or somewhat agreed to a question asking if they worked long hours.

Originally started in 2013 as The International Compendium 25 per cent of all Battle Pass purchases would be contributed to that year's TI prize pool as a way for the player base and community to give back to the scene that they love.

Since then the prize pool for The International has been breaking records year-on-year for the largest esports event in history.

However it does not seem to be going the same way this year. The 2022 TI Battle Pass was released on Sept 2 2022 and as of writing it stands at US$8406960.

According to Dota 2 Prize Tracker this puts it tracking below both 2019 and 2021's prize pool contributions which has not happened before.

It is very possible that this would be the first time since its inception that the prize pool of The International 2022 would be lower than that of previous years.

There are a couple of reasons that could explain why the player base isn't feeling too hot about it and just taking a short visit to r/Dota2 gives us quite a clear picture.

This year's Dota 2 Battle Pass has four main rewards each one giving players exclusive Arcana and Persona skins. These Arcana and Persona are (and their respective Battle Pass Level unlock requirements):

Conduit of the Blueheart Persona (Crystal Maiden) – Level 148

Exile Unveiled Persona (Phantom Assassin) – Level 296

Voidstorm Asylum Arcana (Razor) – Level 383

Claszian Apostasy Arcana (Faceless Void) – Level 495

Other Milestone rewards and their respective levels are as follows:

Announcer Pack – Level 75

Stoneclaw Scavengers Towers – Level 176

Primal Beast Prestige Bundle - Level 223

Treasure Collection (three of each except Trust of the Benefactor) – Level 229

Treasure Collection (three of each except Trust of the Benefactor) – Level 575

Legacy Caster Chat Pack – Level 675

Legacy Caster Chat Pack – Level 771

Legacy Caster Chat Pack – Level 883

Collector's Aegis – Level 1000

Pouches - Aegis of the Immortal Style Unlock – Level 1055

Legacy Epic Caster Chat Pack – Level 1131

Legacy Epic Caster Chat Pack – Level 1245

Trust of the Benefactor 2022 – Level 1498

The Battle Pass pricing remains unchanged from previous years and it's as follows:

Battle Pass Level 1 Bundle - $9.99

Battle Pass Level 50 Bundle - $29.35

Battle Pass Level 100 Bundle - $44.99

Compared to the previous year the number of exclusive items as well as the number of treasure chests available has been reduced.

However this is not the biggest gripe the player base has with the 2022 Dota 2 Battle Pass.

Most of the complaints come from the fact that almost 70 per cent of the Battle Pass rewards are either labelled as ""Coming Soon"" or ""Available in Part 2"".

The only Arcana available for use immediately upon purchase is the Faceless Void set which is unlocked at level 495.

For anyone wondering how much money is needed to unlock that it costs $59.95 for a level 100 Battle Pass and $220.25 for the rest of the 395 levels bringing the total cost to $280.20 if you're impatient.

Hence even for players who are used to shelling out cash year after year for all the rewards the Battle Pass offers this year's experience can feel hollow because there aren't any flashy sets they can show off even after spending that much money.

For players who are planning to grind out the free levels it is an even worse experience this year.

A bunch of mechanics rewarding players with battle points or free levels have been removed namely wagering for battle points in-game achievements Rylai's Blessing spin and Immortal Treasure III which gave a chance for a 50-level drop.

Usually the Battle Pass is released about three months before TI actually starts which gives the prize pool a period of about 100 days to grow and exceed its record-breaking amounts.

This year due to some developmental delays Valve released the Battle Pass only about 40 days before TI starts.

With Part 2 of the Battle Pass continuing after TI Valve has announced that none of the proceeds that come after that will be contributed to the professional scene.

[[nid:594673]]

There is a growing concern in the community that Valve has done this by design to avoid having to contribute 25 per cent of the earnings to the prize pool.

The overall sentiment of the player base is that the 2022 Battle Pass is mediocre at best and they are understandably frustrated since it feels like Valve is releasing an unfinished product.

And it seems like Valve is aware of this as well. A Roshan Replica which is usually earned at level 2000 is not included in this year's Battle Pass as the Battle Pass progress track does not go past level 1905.

""We are not sure if this omission is by design especially since some of the unfinished rewards are marked with ""Coming Soon.""

Ultimately buying the Battle Pass would be worth it if you genuinely enjoy the game then it should be an easy decision. At the same time do make sure to jump in only during Part 1 for your contribution to be added to the competitive prize pool.

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks including The Procter & Gamble Company (PG) Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Procter & Gamble’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry over the past year (+9.9% vs. +8.3%). The company has been gaining from robust pricing and a favorable mix along with strength across segments.



Procter & Gamble has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans to boost margins. This led to bottom line beating the consensus mark for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter fiscal 2024. Consequently PG has provided an optimistic fiscal 2024 view.



However the company has been witnessing supply-chain issues higher SG&A costs higher transportation costs and rising inflation. Its significant international presence exposes it to foreign currency risks which acts as a headwind.



(You can read the full research report on Procter & Gamble here >>>)



Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year. The strong performance is likely to continue in 2024 on the back of continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume coupled with strong Ion procedure growth.



ISRG’s initiative to increase the pricing of procedures should also continue to aid in sales growth in 2024.Improving procedure volume along with better system placements and services across all markets will drive top-line growth this year. Launch of da Vinci SP in Europe and da Vinci 5 in U.S. market should drive system placements higher.



However ongoing supply chain constraints although easing are likely to hurt the availability of devices. Labor shortage in hospitals will likely act as a headwind to procedure growth in 2024.

New automobiles start to depreciate in value the moment your car leaves the lot. If you sell your car even after owning it for just a year its resale value is typically as much as 20% less than its original value according to the Insurance Information Institute or Triple-I. While supply chain issues in the US are shaking up this calculus (meaning in some cases you could make a profit on a used car right now) it’s still an accurate rule of thumb.

That sudden depreciation means that if you’re financing or leasing your new vehicle there may be a time where the amount you owe on the car is greater than the market value of the car itself. For example you may owe $9000 on your car loan but find your car’s depreciated value is now only $7000. In this case if your car gets totaled you’re on the hook for paying more than the car is actually worth to cover your auto loan.

What about car insurance? Although your auto insurance policy would likely kick in if this happened the standard insurance policy would only pay for your vehicle’s current value which means there’s still a sum of money -- a gap -- you’d be obliged to pay. Gap insurance can protect you in this situation.

For more on car insurance be sure to check out our list of the best car insurance companies and best companies for cheap car insurance.

What is gap insurance and when do you need it?

Sometimes referred to as loan or lease payoff insurance gap insurance can cover the difference between your vehicle’s market value and the amount you owe on it in the event of an accident that totals your car.

If you’re leasing your vehicle this coverage is typically required according to Mark Friedlander director of corporate communications at Triple-I. But if you’re financing your vehicle it’s voluntary. So how do you decide whether you should get it?

Here’s a good rule:

“If you put down less than a 20% payment on your car and you’re financing the rest of it -- at least 80% -- throughout four or five years or longer that’s criteria for gap insurance” Friedlander said. “Additionally our recommendation is that you purchase gap insurance through your auto insurer versus buying it from the car dealer or leasing company. The latter is more expensive.”

Buying gap insurance through your current auto insurance company may be difficult however because not all carriers offer gap insurance. In fact many major national insurers like Geico USAA and State Farm don’t.

If you’re financing or leasing a new car here’s a list of major insurers that offer gap insurance coverage.

Allstate View Rates Allstate is one of the oldest and largest car insurers in the US founded in 1937 and ranks fourth in total market share in the US according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. This insurance giant includes gap insurance in its robust list of coverage options though this coverage tends to come at a pricier premium compared to other insurers. While it services all 50 states and Washington D.C. it doesn’t offer gap insurance in New York. Progressive View Rates Progressive offers something similar to gap insurance called “loan/lease payoff insurance.” It works in much the same way as gap insurance covering the difference between your vehicle’s market value and the amount you owe on it. The main difference is that Progressive’s payoff coverage is limited to no more than 25% of your vehicle’s actual cash value though the limit varies by state. For example if your car is worth $5000 and is totaled in an accident and you owe $7000 Progressive would cover $1250. Progressive offers middle-of-the-line rates generally making it potentially a good option to include in your search if you’re looking for a carrier with gap insurance (or something similar enough). Amica View Rates Amica is another major US insurer operating in every state except Hawaii. Amica is known for its high customer satisfaction scores with residents in New England noting particularly positive experiences with the carrier’s service. The insurer provides more than just car insurance policies; it also offers flood condo life home and small business insurance. If you buy gap insurance at Amica it will show up on your bill as “auto loan/lease coverage.” This coverage isn’t available in all states. Nationwide View Rates Nationwide’s gap coverage costs approximately 5% of the total cost between both comprehensive and collision on the customer’s policy according to a Nationwide spokesperson. This carrier sells gap coverage in all states except New York and it operates in all states except Alaska Hawaii and Louisiana. To purchase this coverage you must request it within six months of buying or leasing your new vehicle and hold both comprehensive and collision coverage. Gap insurance at Nationwide is available until the vehicle turns six years old. Liberty Mutual View Rates Liberty Mutual headquartered in Boston Massachusetts is another major carrier that provides gap insurance. The carrier offers auto home and life insurance policies in all 50 states plus Washington D.C. making Liberty Mutual’s gap coverage one of the most accessible across the country. That noted the carrier receives a high number of complaints nationally filed with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and below average scores in J.D. Power customer satisfaction surveys. The Hartford View Rates The Hartford offers a list of car insurance coverage that includes gap insurance. But this carrier isn’t for all drivers. The Hartford’s auto policy is geared towards drivers over the age of 50 who are members of the American Association of Retired Persons. Along with gap insurance Hartford also offers car replacement coverage which will give you money for a new car of the same make and model if your car is totaled instead of paying out the depreciated value of your car.

Gap Insurance FAQs

FAQs

Can you get gap insurance from a different company than your main insurance provider? Yes but it’s much more expensive. The other option if you’re not getting it through an insurer is to buy gap insurance through the lender or dealership you bought the car with. Again this is more expensive than getting it through your main insurance provider as an add-on to your policy.

Do I need gap insurance if I have full coverage? Yes. If you want to insure the gap between your car’s market value and the amount you owe on it you’ll need gap insurance. Full coverage won’t cover that gap on its own.

Can you add gap insurance to your policy at any time? No. More often than not you’ll need to add gap insurance immediately or soon after buying your new car. For example Nationwide requires that you buy gap insurance within six months of getting a new car.

Methodology

CNET reviews insurance carriers and products by exhaustively comparing them across set criteria. For auto insurance we examine average annual premium rates for full coverage consumer complaints collision repair scores the carrier’s financial strength auto claims satisfaction and overall customer satisfaction. Our data comes from a multitude of sources.

Auto insurance rates come from Bankrate which gathers data using Quadrant Information Services. We also use both J.D. Power annual surveys that collect data on customer auto claims satisfaction and overall customer satisfaction.

Consumer complaints are taken from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) which collects consumer complaints across states indexing complaints on a scale that takes into account the industry average. We collect the financial strength rating of each carrier from the A.M. Best Rating. Lastly we collected collision repair scores from the Crash Network Insurer Report Card which collects data from collision repair professionals including mechanics to gauge the quality of collision claims service from insurance carriers.

For this gap insurance list we confirmed with major insurers on the availability of gap insurance and the details of that coverage.

The Starbucks unionizing drive is a bright spot for a labor movement that has been in a steep decline since the 1950s battered by anti-labor corporations crippling labor laws and lack of organizing zeal by labor unions themselves. California is a center of the new effort with 16 stores throughout the state voting for union representation.

Tyler Keeling was one of those leading the successful effort at a Starbucks store in Lakewood. Like most of the other Starbucks organizers he is young — 26 — idealistic and determined to fight a corporation that has branded itself as progressive and open-minded. The reality is that these young union advocates have faced strident opposition from Starbucks executives and attempts to intimidate pro-union employees.

Recently workers at Keeling’s store even went on an unfair labor practice strike for a day over allegations that Starbucks is withholding new benefits from unionized stores that were announced by the company on May 3. Even though the first Starbucks store voted to unionize on Dec. 9 2021 there is still not one union contract that has been negotiated.

Keeling who will speak Monday at the Los Angeles/Long Beach Harbor Labor Coalition Labor Day Parade spoke to Capital & Main from his home in Long Beach about his life and what the workers at Starbucks want to achieve.

This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.

Capital & Main: You’re going to be sitting across the negotiating table from a Starbucks lawyer making $1000 an hour. Does that make you nervous?

Tyler Keeling: I don’t have a reason to be. The worst thing that can happen to me has already happened.

I don’t have a stable income so I don’t have too much to lose right? I’m not afraid of these people who have this rich education. I’ve got nothing to lose but I’ve got everything to gain. A fancy education doesn’t mean anything where I come from. People from the high desert like me who survived everything we’ve survived don’t have a reason to be scared of a lawyer from a huge corporation.

We have workers from different backgrounds and from different places like Compton who know what it’s like to come from an underserved community. We have LGBT co-workers who know what it is like to have little or no economic upward mobility. We are entry level workers but what we do is skilled labor. But we’re not getting compensated for skilled labor. We are scraping the bottom of the barrel so we have everything to gain.



“We work hard to make profits for Starbucks and they make so much money that they spend on everything but investing in us.”



So this first contract will be critical because Starbucks will want to give as little as possible to show other nonunion stores that unionization is not worth the trouble. And you need to get something significant to show workers at those other stores what is possible with a union.

That is definitely correct. First off having a good contract is necessary for us to make enough money to provide for what we need: our rent and food and so on. But also a contract is going to be a signal for other stores to look at where they can see why unionizing is important. We deserve a good contract because we work hard to make profits for Starbucks and they make so much money that they spend on everything but investing in us.

So it’s crucial for Starbucks to stop you from obtaining anything significant through negotiations.

They definitely are trying but they are not going to succeed. I currently make $18 an hour which ends up being about $1300 a month. I barely survive. My share of the rent is close to $1200 a month not including utilities or groceries or insurance for my car. I am using what savings I have left and using credit cards when I have to. It’s not feasible when you think that what I make is just over minimum wage. Many of my fellow workers are in the same situation.

Our store makes $60000 a week sometimes. Our manager often posts the store metrics in the back office for everyone to see in order to inspire us to do better. But it also made everyone aware of what the company was making. It’s a do or die situation for us. We don’t have another choice. That’s a big part of why I organize because I don’t want anyone else to have to live like that either — living paycheck to paycheck.

When did you start organizing your store?

I had my first conversation about unionization the day after the Starbucks in Buffalo New York won their election in early December. I started going around to everybody that I worked with and talked to everyone. I told them why unions were good and what they could do for workers. Sometimes I talked to people for hours. The other workers wanted to talk about it and wondered what was going to happen if they unionized. A lot of people knew they could trust me and I would be honest and real with them. There was fear at first but even if they were scared they knew they could trust me and I wouldn’t let them down. We would talk at their house outside the store on breaks and on the phone through Facetime.

I had no other connections across the country at this time. The first person I did meet from outside of California was Nikki Taylor from a Memphis Tennessee store one of the “Memphis Seven” who were all fired for organizing in February. They are legendary. Their firing made headlines everywhere. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has had them reinstated to the jobs as of a week or two ago. Nikki and I became friends and we talked a lot about organizing.

Then I met others from the Los Angeles area who were also organizing. We worked closely with Josie Serrano from the Long Beach store at Seventh and Redondo and we started doing things together and coordinating our activities. We learned how to be community organizers together. We started organizing our stores side by side since February. We really started moving things forward in early February of this year and we filed our petition for an election on March 7. Our vote was on May 13 and that’s when we won 24 to 1.

What were the primary issues for you and your co-workers?

The kinds of things that drove us to organize were wages inconsistent scheduling lack of accountability and transparency from management in the workplace and no true workplace protections from being unfairly fired or for being unfairly harassed. There were many reasons. We’re sitting here with historic inflation and we have been suffering and watching everything get more expensive. It was becoming harder to live. It was time to do something about that for ourselves.

Did you have experience with unions before this?

Not really? I knew a little bit and some key points of labor history. It is something I’ve become much more interested in. I’ve started to read and study more about it. When I was 15 or 16 I started reading about topics of social justice especially about marginalized people fighting for equal rights immigrant rights gay rights. With that came the history of what workers had done and the struggles they had. All of these fights became a single entity to me. I read reports that were posted online and I talked to a lot of people who knew more than I did. It was a community effort where everybody was talking about these fights for justice together in whatever space that was available — maybe the internet maybe at a party. It became a form of community teaching. It’s bigger than self-taught. It’s other people teaching me and me teaching other people. It’s holding each other accountable to learn as much as we can and to share what we know.

Did you go to college?

After I graduated high school I lived on a friend’s couch in El Monte. I worked at an assisted living care job in Whittier but the hours were inconsistent. I made about $200 every two weeks. It was bad. I went to Citrus College in Azusa for a year but then moved to Olympia Washington and started working at Starbucks there for $13 an hour as a barista in 2016.

In June of 2017 I moved again to New Jersey and worked at another Starbucks but took a pay cut to $10 an hour. I was promoted to supervisor but still only making $12 an hour. Moving from place to place I had no stability whatsoever. I moved back to California in 2018 and started working at a Starbucks in Glendora and moved to the Lakewood store in 2019.



“When I say I come from nothing I mean that. There was no economic opportunity in Apple Valley. It’s an economically abandoned area.”



But it was something about labor history that got you excited.

I come from a poor background and labor history inherently ties into poverty. The workers movement is about fighting poverty and fighting to make things better for workers. That rings true with almost anybody who comes from a background of poverty and it certainly rang true for me.

Tell me more about your background where you grew up.

My mom raised me and my two siblings in Apple Valley in the high desert right off the 15 Freeway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. We were always in poverty. We faced homelessness most of the time. My mother struggled with amphetamine addiction most of her adult life but sobered up a few years before passing away due to cervical cancer when I was 15. She never had stable work so I never thought about what it would mean to have a career. My father shod horses but he was not in my life as my parents were divorced when I was a year old.

When I say I come from nothing I mean that. There was no economic opportunity in Apple Valley. It’s an economically abandoned area which causes many people to fall into addiction. I’ve struggled throughout my entire life. I’ve never had any true form of stability. The closest things to stability I’ve had was my social circle my best friends my partner my co-workers. When my mom died my grandparents took me and my siblings in.

When did you start to understand there were economic classes in the United States?

I became very aware of economic classes at age 10 or 11. I remember asking my mom “Are we poor?” I could see that she was sad that I asked that question. Despite her struggle with addiction my mom and I had a good relationship.

In the desert a lot of people are poor but I did feel judged in many ways. In middle school I began to realize some stark differences between families. Other kids my age had cell phones and it seemed like a normal thing. I wanted a cell phone too but there was no way we would ever be able to afford one. I never got new clothes for school so class became very easy to recognize.

So now that you have a union what are the next steps?

We need to sit down and negotiate a contract for our store with Starbucks and so far they have been stalling. We submitted our request many weeks ago.



“They are trying to minimize the money they spend on labor in order to maximize the amount of profit they get out of any given day.”



It seems like this effort does not have outside professional union staff making all the decisions about strategy and approach.

I can’t stress enough about the fact that this movement is worker led. We are the union and we are not sitting around doing nothing and waiting for something to happen. We’re all active and we’re all interconnected across the country and we are standing together. We know our rights and we know what Starbucks is doing. And there’s a lot to be said about us being the ones to drive this. In our stores we are the ones who have educated each other and Starbucks can’t destroy that. It’s impossible. We have a force that is powerful. Workers United staff guide us — the union that we are affiliated with — but ultimately we have been empowered to make our own decisions.

How is it that Starbucks extracts more and more profit in the stores?

Our workload doesn’t lessen but what does lessen is the labor that is allotted in our stores. Some days we might have six people on the floor catching all this work. At other times it will be four. They are trying to minimize the money they spend on labor in order to maximize the amount of profit they get out of any given day. And we’re expected to do those numbers no matter how many people we have on the floor. They are raising prices all the time without adjusting anything for us in terms of our income. It’s very clear what they’re doing.

I was at a store recently in Malibu and honestly it looked like a factory or like that “I Love Lucy” episode where Lucille Ball is trying to keep the chocolates from falling on the floor from the conveyor belt.

We are working in what is called a “channel production” process where we are all planted at certain spots essentially repeating the same movements until we are moved to a different spot. For instance one channel is producing food or another will be producing beverages at a single workstation. There are very strict routines that you follow and you repeat them your entire shift. Starbucks put a lot of money and research into developing those processes and those are the process standards that our jobs exist by. Step by step every single day and these steps are laid out in training.

It seems highly regimented and reminds me of factory engineer Frederick Winslow Taylor who developed this worker efficiency method in the late 19th and early 20th century.

Yes there is even a routine for steaming milk that you must follow precisely. There’s an order for how you pull your shots of espresso and how to get syrup into drinks. When you stop working on one beverage you start another beverage. It’s very detail oriented. It’s not yet about how you should move your hands in certain ways but it would not surprise me if that is coming. There are expectations that we must produce a given number of items in a 30-minute period. People definitely get hurt all the time. Falling tripping they get burned. And those time demands are extremely hard to meet but some days we do.



“They simply don’t defend you when you face homophobia in the workplace. Many times I’ve been blamed for a customer’s homophobic comments towards me.”



I’ve heard the drive-throughs are even more demanding.

Yes there are goals they set to measure our success. Monday through Friday we’re expected to have everything prepared at the window for a customer including food and payment processing and beverage in hand within 45 seconds.

And you receive warnings or demerits if these standards are not met?

I’ve seen it happen. “Underperforming” people are met with and encouraged to get to that point of meeting and exceeding the standards set for all of us. It can start off as a verbal warning and then it could escalate all the way to a performance review of your job. The onus is always put on the worker instead of the process itself.

Starbucks has this reputation as being this groovy enlightened progressive company. They hire gay people they let you color your hair purple or put a ring in your nose. So what’s beneath the image?

It’s extremely superficial. They claim inclusiveness and I started in this company because I wanted somewhere I could work that accepted gay people especially coming from a small conservative town. Gay culture is not necessarily part of the mainstream. And I remember going to work at Starbucks and my store manager at the time simply not being OK with how I acted. I said and acted in ways that were very much informed by the fact that I was gay. It was glaringly obvious. Starbucks claims to love gay people but it’s only the acceptable kind of gay or the boxed in kind of gay. And they simply don’t defend you when you face homophobia in the workplace. Many times I’ve been blamed for a customer’s homophobic comments towards me.

Where do you want to be in 10 years? What are your future aspirations?

I want to be firmly planted in the world of labor and helping workers organize for the rest of my life. For me what I’m doing feels right and natural. Being an organizer means to learn to establish trust and make connections with people. It means to help people take back power in the workplace and to build community education and solidarity. When I zoom out and think about this moment it blows my mind what we’ve been able to do. When I zoom in on myself it feels natural and it feels like I’m exactly where I should be. But I’m not going anywhere until we have a contract.

King publicly condemned the Vietnam War because it had “broken and eviscerated” the civil-rights and anti-poverty movements at home. The American government was “the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today.”

Read: Martin Luther King Jr. on the Vietnam War

In 2022 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky invoked another MLK speech while asking Congress to help his country repel the Russian invasion. “‘I have a dream.’ These words are known to each of you today. I can say ‘I have a need: I need to protect our sky.’” Two months later Democrats voted unanimously in favor of a $40 billion package of arms and other assistance to Kyiv.

These two moments capture an important shift in how the American left thinks about the U.S. military and war more generally. Progressives typically see war as inherently murderous and dehumanizing—sapping progress curtailing free expression and channeling resources into the “military-industrial complex.” The left led the opposition to the Vietnam War and the Iraq War and condemned American war crimes from the My Lai massacre to Abu Ghraib. Historically progressive critics have charged the military with a litany of sins including discrimination against LGBTQ soldiers and a reliance on recruiting in poor communities.

Meanwhile for decades the right embraced America’s warriors. Defense hawks were one of the three legs of the “Reagan stool” along with social and fiscal conservatives. The military itself leaned right. One study found that from 1976 to 1996 the number of Army officers who identified as Republican increased from one-third to two-thirds. In 2016 according to a poll in the Military Times active service members favored Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton by a margin of nearly two to one.

In the past few years however these views have started to change. From 2021 to 2022 the share of Republicans who had “a great deal” or “quite a lot of confidence” in the military fell from 81 to 71 percent whereas for Democrats the number increased from 63 to 67 percent—cutting the gap from 18 points to four. And the military’s views shifted in tandem. In 2020 dozens of former Republican national-security officials endorsed President Joe Biden because Trump had “gravely damaged America’s role as a world leader.” In one poll before the 2020 election more active service members backed Biden than Trump (41 to 37 percent).

Why has this happened? Two big reasons are Trump and Ukraine.

Trump saw the military as a symbol of power and surrounded himself with a phalanx of generals. But when he realized they were not a Praetorian Guard that would do his bidding defend him against all enemies foreign and domestic and keep him in office by force if necessary he soured on the military. Trump trampled on its most sacred beliefs and rituals saying that U.S. generals were “dopes” and “babies” who “want to do nothing but fight wars.” Americans killed in battle he said were “losers” and “suckers.” Trump suggested that Gold Star families had spread COVID at the White House. He railed against American prisoners of war: “I like people who weren’t captured.” He pardoned three service members accused or convicted of war crimes even though military leaders said it would erode the military’s code of justice. In his testimony to Congress Trump’s acting defense secretary Christopher Miller said that Trump had told him to ready the National Guard to protect his supporters on January 6 rather than Congress itself. All of this created a fundamental clash with the military’s code of honor and its commitment to the Constitution. Trump wondered why American generals couldn’t be more like Hitler’s generals—by which he meant the loyalist fanatics who battled in the ruins of Berlin not the Wehrmacht officials who tried to assassinate the Nazi dictator.

Since he left office Trump has fueled the conservative belief that Biden is indoctrinating the armed forces with liberal ideas. Republican Senator Ted Cruz said the U.S. military is suffering from a “woke cancer” and is in danger of becoming “a bunch of pansies.” The Fox News host Laura Ingraham suggested defunding the military until it abandons its diversity programs: “Go after their budget.”

It’s true that the military has moved left and not just because of Trump. After George Floyd was murdered in 2020 Kaleth Wright tweeted: “Who am I? I am a Black man who happens to be Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force.” Last year the Pentagon warned “To keep the nation secure we must tackle the existential threat of climate change.”

This shouldn’t be so surprising. The military is the epitome of big government with egalitarian wages socialized medicine and the best government-run child-care system in the country. No wonder General Wesley Clark joked that it’s “the purest application of socialism there is.” Now progressives are expressing a new gratitude for an institution that understands the value of diversity cares about the rule of law and was willing to stand up to Trump when the future of democracy was most in danger. At a time of rampant conspiracy theories like QAnon liberals appreciate that the military operates in a world of tangible threats and complex logistics and has a basic respect for reality. George Orwell said people often cling to falsehoods until the lie slams into the truth “usually on a battlefield.”

Then came Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. No foreign conflict since the Spanish Civil War has so captured the imagination of the left. Nearly a century ago many progressives saw Spain as a pure fight between democracy and fascism. Ernest Hemingway’s novel For Whom the Bell Tolls and Pablo Picasso’s painting Guernica captured the horror at fascist brutality. About 3000 Americans traveled to Spain to fight in the international brigades. Today many on the left see Ukraine as another contest between fascism and democracy and that rare thing: a good war. Thousands of Americans have gone to join the struggle.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is the antithesis of everything the left stands for. Not only did he launch an unprovoked attack on a sovereign democratic nation but he has also disparaged LGBTQ rights multiculturalism and immigration and claimed that “the liberal idea” has “outlived its purpose.” Zelensky in contrast has built bridges with the global left. He addressed the Glastonbury music festival in the U.K. where the revelers chanted his name to the tune of The White Stripes’ “Seven Nation Army.” In Germany the Green Party led the charge to supply weapons to Kyiv overturning decades of German wariness about intervening in foreign wars. LGBTQ protesters in Berlin also demanded that Germany step up arms shipments to Ukraine so that a Pride parade can one day be held in the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol. Ukrainian liberals—artists translators teachers filmmakers—have joined the struggle. As one writer put it: “All our hipsters in Ukraine fight.”

To be sure there’s a leftist fringe in the United States that still considers America the world’s evil empire and remains deeply hostile to its military power. That fringe includes the linguist and political activist Noam Chomsky who praised Trump as a model statesman for pushing for a negotiated peace in Ukraine. But the bulk of the left has shown remarkable solidarity with the Ukrainian cause. Liberals who once protested the Iraq War now urge Washington to dispatch more rocket launchers to defeat Russian imperialism. Representative Jamaal Bowman of New York a member of the progressive caucus tweeted: “We unequivocally stand with the global Ukrainian community in the wake of Putin’s attack.”

The main opposition to helping Ukraine has come from the right. Trump who has long praised Putin as a “genius” questioned why Americans were sending so much money to Ukraine. Most congressional Republicans backed the aid package to Kyiv in May but 11 Republican senators and 57 House Republicans opposed it. Republican Representative Matt Gaetz tweeted that if the GOP takes the House in the upcoming midterms support for Ukraine will end. The Fox News host Tucker Carlson claimed that Ukraine is an American puppet state and that his real enemies are not in Moscow but on the American left: “Has Putin ever called me a racist?”

In March Democrats were 10 points more likely than Republicans to say that Washington “has a responsibility to protect and defend Ukraine from Russia.” By July this gap had grown to 22 points. Another recent survey found that Democrats were more supportive than Republicans of sending weapons to Ukraine as well as of accepting Ukrainian refugees in the United States. A remarkable 42 percent of Democrats favored deploying American troops to Ukraine versus 34 percent of Republicans.

Progressives have always viewed foreign conflicts and domestic struggles as connected—with war being either a dangerous contagion or a righteous crusade. A poster from the Spanish Civil War showed the image of a dead child: “If you tolerate this your children will be next.” A generation later the pendulum swung and King saw intervention in Vietnam as a threat to civil rights in America. Today the pendulum has swung back and the left sees the march for freedom in America and the battle to defend Ukraine as elements of the same global fight for democracy. After all the aggressor in Ukraine—Putin—also meddled in the 2016 election to help Trump.

Will the alliance between the left and the military last? Progressives may grow nervous about escalation in Ukraine or lose interest in the war. The economy remains the most pressing issue for most Americans. Perhaps like Orwell in Catalonia some American volunteers in Ukraine may decide that the struggle is not as pure as they thought. The left’s underlying concerns about the U.S. military have hardly disappeared. Republicans may one day shove Trump offstage and try to get the ’80s band back together—defense hawks social conservatives and fiscal conservatives.

But for now Trump remains the dominant force in the Republican Party. The Ukrainian cause remains resonant. And the left may worry about another authoritarian great power that threatens a smaller democracy: China mobilizing against Taiwan.

An era of liberal hawkishness should not mean an unthinking embrace of the military. America needs a strong progressive voice to check the rampant waste in the military-industrial complex (which ran to hundreds of billions of dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan). The military has very real problems like the crisis of sexual assault. It doesn’t benefit from the sort of soft-focus “Thank you for your service” reverence that has prevented people from asking tough questions about America’s disastrous wars in the past. On Ukraine liberals can channel Washington’s policy in a more progressive direction stressing human rights pressing for investment in green technology to reduce reliance on Russian energy and going after Moscow’s dirty money.

In the end the U.S. military is the world’s anti-fascist insurance policy. The insurance premiums may be outlandish. And most of the time we don’t need the policy. Until one day we do. If you need to ship M777 howitzers to Ukraine the military-industrial complex has its uses.

In 1967 King was right to see Vietnam as a catastrophe for America at home and abroad. “If America’s soul becomes totally poisoned part of the autopsy must read: Vietnam.” But today we face a different world and a stark choice. Zelensky Ukrainian progressives and the European Union? Or Putin Trump and Tucker Carlson? The left picked the right side.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZGF3Z3BvdW5kZGFpbHkuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDQvYmFrZXItbWF5ZmllbGQtbG92ZXMtY29udHJvdmVyc2lhbC1nYW1lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Baker Mayfield loves playing that controversial game,

Amazon (AMZN 0.27%) is one of those stocks investors love to own and for good reason. Not only has it delivered incredible results since its initial public offering (growing over 131100%) but there's also loads of growth ahead for the company as online shopping expands.

There's a lot going for the stock over the long term but its size and popularity mean the company is trading at a premium around 116 times its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Thankfully investing directly in Amazon isn't the only way to benefit from the company's incredible e-commerce growth and market share.

Here are the stocks three Motley Fool contributors believe are great alternatives to Amazon: Digital Realty Trust (DLR -0.86%) Zillow Group (ZG 3.91%) (Z 4.34%) and Prologis (PLD 0.56%).

Exposure to data centers without the retail risk

Kristi Waterworth (Digital Realty Trust): Investing in Amazon means investing in various business models that converge under a single ticker. But not every Amazon investor is there for the retail streaming logistics and data-storage combo model. Some are simply looking for more ways to expose themselves to the growing world of data centers.

If you’re one of these investors the good news is that data-center real estate investment trusts (REITs) are a great way to get more direct exposure to data center growth without all the risk of retail tagging along for the ride.

Digital Realty Trust is a strong data center REIT with a proven track record and direct ties to Amazon. It leases a portion of its space to Amazon Web Services (AWS) Amazon’s data arm (and it services AWS by providing expanded capacity and connectivity to its customers).

Amazon also owns and develops its own data centers somewhat in competition with Digital Realty Trust but the latter still has an upper hand because it only deals in data centers giving it a larger and more diversified tenant base across a range of industries including other e-commerce companies.

And unlike Amazon Digital Realty Trust pays quarterly dividends estimated at $4.88 per share annually for 2022. This is up 5.17% over 2021 and its dividend payouts have only continued to climb since 2005 when they were a mere $1 per share annually.

Free cash flow has been more or less steady in 2021 and 2020 at about $1.7 billion but this is part of an upward trend that has been slowly building since 2012 when free cash flow was at a comparatively small $542 million. In that time Digital Realty Trust has been working to expand operations across the globe and now has over 300 data centers in more than 25 countries on six continents. This includes newly acquired data centers in emerging markets like South Africa and Israel.

Digital Realty Trust is one the REITs I am most bullish about not only because it has a grasp on the future and where and how it needs to grow to remain competitive but also because we live in an increasingly data-centric world where opportunities will only increase for data centers in the near term.

Unlike AWS Digital Realty Trust remains small enough to be fairly agile and to move quickly into emerging markets while still being a massive presence in the data center world.

Can Zillow become the Amazon of real estate buying?

Mike Price (Zillow): For the first several years of its business life Amazon was a bookseller. It sold a few other things too but the business was a lot more concentrated than it is today. Today the e-commerce giant makes money from AWS third-party sales advertising subscriptions physical stores and even books. And Zillow might be on the verge of its own transformation from a very concentrated revenue source into more-diversified business avenues.

Much of Zillow’s revenue comes from the buyer’s agent-referral commission. People go on the website to check out houses and click on a link for an agent in the area and use that agent. This is a very profitable revenue source and will likely continue to be the backbone of Zillow’s business for some time. But the company wants to diversify revenue streams.

Zillow is trying to get more involved in seller’s agent commissions mortgage originations and servicing closing services and rental services. Each of these areas could add a multiple to the amount of revenue that the company makes from every sale that begins on its website.

The good news is that the website already has traffic. There were 234 million average monthly unique users in the second quarter of 2022 and 2.9 billion total visits to the website.

The key will be converting those users from view-only to paying customers. There is certainly a demand for a service like the one Zillow could provide.

Today when looking for a house you have to find an agent get a list of available houses travel to each of them for a tour get pre-approved for a loan make an offer find an inspector be approved for the loan find a title insurance provider and lastly travel to the closing location to sign what seem like hundreds of pages of documents.

Now imagine if you could use a tailored Zillow search to virtually tour the houses you were interested in only visiting the ones that you would likely make an offer on. Then be pre-approved in minutes before the process even starts and be approved right on the app. Choose an inspector and title-insurance agent from a list of providers with customer reviews and ratings. And then close virtually on the same app to save all important documents right where you know they’ll be.

Part of the reason Amazon was able to grow as much as it has is the integration among its services. You can go to Amazon's website to buy anything you need read books watch shows rent movies and even publish your own books. If Zillow can become the same thing for real estate buyers it has a lot of room to run.

Back-end access to e-commerce distribution and logistics

Liz Brumer-Smith (Prologis): As the largest e-commerce company in the world Amazon needs a lot of industrial space to store and send its products quickly and efficiently. A huge part of Amazon's business is the management logistics and distribution of the products it sells.

That's where Prologis comes into the picture. It is the largest industrial operator in the world and Amazon is its largest tenant. As of the second quarter roughly 4.8% of Prologis' net effective rents came from Amazon thanks to the 33.6 million square feet of space it leases from the company.

Rumors were floating in late July about Amazon needing less logistics and industrial space based on its current supply which has put some pressure on Prologis' share price as of late. But the REIT's latest earnings call and the company's industrial-operations updates have put investors' concerns to rest. Amazon made up 21% of Prologis' newly executed leases in the second quarter. Plus its retention rate for spaces currently leased by Amazon was 95% 20 points higher than the portfolio average.

The really great thing with Prologis is that it isn't just an alternative way to invest in Amazon.

The French-Ivorian banker is understood to have taken advice on the question of his dual citizenship in preparation for a potential run for the West African nation’s highest office in 2025.

It is likely that Mr Thiam will have to resolve his citizenship status over the next two-and-a-half years if he is to run in the upcoming presidential election. According to the Ivorian constitution presidential candidates must have been born in the country and are barred from holding a foreign passport.

The move would bring Mr Thiam back into Ivorian politics more than two decades after he left the West African country's cabinet following a coup to pursue a career in finance.

He worked for McKinsey and Aviva then took the role of chief executive of Prudential in 2009 becoming the first black boss of a FTSE 100 company.

Mr Thiam left to run Credit Suisse six years later. In 2020 he was forced to resign over a corporate spying scandal in which be denied wrongdoing.

Mr Thiam has since sold his Zürich home and is said to split his time between London and Paris – the latter being his primary residence.

Outside finance he has also taken a keen interest in African politics serving as a special envoy for the African Union where he has helped the continent deal with the economic fallout from the Covid pandemic.

Last month Mr Thiam travelled to the Ivory Coast – his first such visit in over 20 years – for meetings and to visit family.

Upon his arrival in Abidjan on August 8 Mr Thiam was received by Ivorian president Alassane Ouattara at his home in the fashionable Cocody Riviera district.

The meeting lasted an hour and was attended by Mr Thiam's elder brothers the governor of Yamoussoukro Augustin Thiam and the minister of transport Aziz Thiam.

Mr Thiam - who is the grandnephew of the Ivory Coast’s first president and whose father was also an Ivorian politician - served under president Henri Konan Bédié between 1993 and 1999 before the government was toppled in a military coup.

He was abroad at the time and returned to the Ivory Coast where he was placed under house arrest. The new military regime offered him a position as chief of staff but Mr Thiam declined and was exiled.

A spokesman for Mr Thiam has said he maintains ""regular and cordial contact” with former presidents Laurent Gbagbo and Mr Bédié. He met both men during his recent trip.

Mr Thiam told Mr Bédié during their discussion that he still supports his party.

However he has largely steered clear of Ivorian politics since the coup and only re-entered the fray in October 2020 amid the last election after Mr Ouattara’s chosen successor suddenly passed away.

In contravention of constitutional term limits Mr Ouattara ultimately took a third term in office which sparked protests and violence.

“We must favour unity and avoid that which divides” Mr Thiam said in an interview with TV5Monde days before the election declining to comment on the legality of Mr Ouattara’s actions.

Mr Ouattara who will be 83 years old at the time of the next election met with French president Emmanuel Macron in Paris at the time to discuss the crisis. Mr Thiam’s name was floated as a possible addition to a future Ivorian government in the talks that followed.

Throughout his career Mr Thiam has frequently spoken of his feelings of guilt for living in a developed country when he feels there is much he could do and contribute to his native Ivory Coast.

More recently in December 2021 he batted off questions about his presidential ambitions in an interview with the magazine Jeune Afrique.

He said: “I do what I can in my area of expertise which is economics to get things done.

“But I will answer your question – ask me again in 2025.”

Mr Thiam and his representatives were contacted for comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lml0d2ViLmNvLnphL2FydGljbGUvdGhlLWhpZ2gtY29zdC1vZi1maWNhLW5vbi1jb21wbGlhbmNlL2o1YWxyN1FBYTJ5N3BZUWvSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The high cost of FICA non-compliance,"South Africa’s prudential authority is sending a strong message that non-compliance with the Financial Intelligence Centre Act will not be tolerated hitting large institutions with hefty fines and penalties running into millions.

The cost to the local businesses is more than financial; the reputational damage when called out for such violations is equally critical and can often limit the ability to conduct business as usual.

Nedbank is the latest business to face administrative sanctions for non-compliance by the South African Reserve Bank’s Prudential Regulation Authority. These included cautions reprimands and a total financial penalty of R35 million of which R15 million has been conditionally suspended. The bank has since remedied the issues.

FICA came into effect in July 2003 to combat financial crimes such as money laundering tax evasion and terrorist financing. According to the Act the responsibility as an accountable institution includes identifying and verifying clients and ensuring that their information is correct and up to date.

The Act introduced the “Know Your Customer” requirements where businesses have to establish and verify the identity of all clients before instituting a business relationship with them or concluding any transaction.

In an era of increasing transparency trust and integrity help consumers make more informed choices. Consumers expect business protection and when enterprises fail in their duties due to non-compliance they not only violate industry regulations but erode consumer confidence too.

“Institutions as well as companies can avoid serious consequences by having a well co-ordinated compliance management system in place. Keeping abreast with updates and changes to regulations allows companies to identify threats long before they have serious impact on the business” said LexisNexis South Africa chief technology officer Terrance Naidoo.

It’s never been more important to ensure full compliance. In keeping with the risk-based approach of decision-making prescribed by FICA legal tech giant LexisNexis SA introduced Lexis KYC (Know Your Customer) an easy-to-use intelligent cost-effective solution that establishes and verifies the identity of clients.

The solution has a built-in risk assessment matrix and enables clients to create their own compliance risk questionnaire. In addition it records all interactions and verifications within the system and stores all documents safely in one place with an auditable compliance trail.

“Lexis KYC allows you to manage your customer database no matter how big or small giving you the confidence that the right kind of KYC is performed at the right customer risk level” said Naidoo.

“With the implementation of our ongoing KYC maintenance process managing the re-identification of customer information is taken care of. You control your upfront customer onboarding and re-identification process from the start; Lexis KYC helps you to automate it” he said.

Lexis KYC works hand in hand with an organisation’s unique compliance requirements. The KYC Risk Assessment allows configuration of a risk assessment according to the customer business product and country risk specific to each organisation. It also allows businesses to conduct identity and address verification of national and foreign individuals as well juristic entities on a per search basis.

“Enhanced due diligence now becomes affordable to the customer as they can control when and on whom adverse media sanctions and watchlist screenings take place. It gives the customer full control of their risk appetite” said Naidoo.

Meanwhile the Monetary Board has raised the minimum capital for rural banks to P50 million from as little as P10 million compliance to which the affected entities must do within the next five years.

According to Rural Bankers Association of the Philippines (RBAP) the industry is embracing the advantages of digitalization in order to remain relevant in a business environment that has been reshaped by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Digital transformation as the buzzword goes makes “deploying financial services as easy as tapping on a screen while [the rural banking industry remains] grounded in its role as a vital provider of financial services that uplifts the lives of our countryside’s economic drivers—the farmers the fisherfolk and the microentrepreneurs” RBAP said in a statement.

As of Aug. 31 the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) lists 380 licensed rural banks across the archipelago. The latest list of RBAP members counts 358 such banks.

In January then RBAP president Albert Concha Jr. said the group was anticipating an upward push this year on countryside incomes especially with the upcoming national elections in May that brings “immense multiplier benefits to the local economies.”

In Circular No. 1151 dated Aug. 24 the BSP said its policymaking body approved last Aug. 4 Resolution No. 1145 which approves the increase of minimum capital requirements for rural banks.

This is part of initiatives under the Rural Bank Strengthening Program intended to enhance operations capacity and competitiveness of these banks.

“A strong capital base enables rural banks to enhance their risk management systems upgrade resources and manage operational costs meet prudential standards and accelerate digital transformation” Circular 1151 stated.

The requirements set the minimum capital for rural banks with a head office only as well as those with up to five branches at P50 million (from P10 million); those with six to 10 branches at P120 million (P15 million); and those with more than 10 branches at P200 million (P20 million).

New England-based self-storage developer True Storage has begun preliminary work to convert the sprawling remains of the former retailer into a self-storage facility that they hope to open by March 1.

""We're excited about the project to put a new face on the building"" said True Storage Head of Acquisitions and Due Diligence Josh Sullivan. ""We're a national self-storage developer based out of New England but we do service the greater eastern portion of the United States basically east of the Mississippi River is our cutoff. We specialize in conversions of former big box retail and industrial property. This one is a K-Mart we've done a lot of Sears Toys R Us Circuit City the larger retailers across the country who due to changes in multiple landscapes have gone defunct...""

Frenchtown's K-Mart closed in 2017. In March 2021 the Frenchtown Board of Trustees approved a rezoning of the property located at 1290 N. Monroe St. to commercial which allowed a company like True Storage to consider it for their uses.

""We've found ourselves a pretty good niche"" Sullivan said. ""We're able to come in there and basically revamp taking the existing structure and demolishing the interior to convert it into climate-controlled self-storage as well as enhancing the facade...""

Sullivan said that True Storage's facilities are typically used mostly by local residents and that the company's market data showed them there was a substantial need for this type of service in Frenchtown.

But storage may not be the only new business coming soon to this property. Sullivan said that True Storage is looking to sell most of the old K-Mart parking lot to some other type of business.

""Our parking needs as you can imagine aren't as large as the previous use as a retail (business)"" Sullivan said. ""We're selling some of that parking lot as retail space and we're hoping to get a retail user on that parking lot whether that be a quick-service (restaurant) a bank or something of that nature we'd love to have (something else) on the site so we are marketing that parking lot for retail use.

""We're excited to be a local service for Frenchtown residents and to turn the property around.""

Motorists heading through the Five Corners in Vail’s Gate may soon need to fuel up before tackling longer lines of traffic if developers get their way.

The Cornwall Planning Board is discussing a potential apartment complex to be built on vacant land near the New Windsor line on Route 94. If approved Biagini Woods a 312-unit complex will occupy an area to the east of the Cornwall Central High School. The area in question is wedged in between Palamino Road and the New York State Thruway positioned directly across from Riley Road.

A public hearing will be held to discuss the proposed project and the community is welcome to attend. The Cornwall Planning Board will host the meeting this Tuesday September 6 2022 at 7:00pm at Munger Cottage located at 40 Munger Drive in Cornwall.

The New Windsor Planning Board has also been discussing two proposed development projects in the vicinity of the Five Corners.

A gas station and convenience store is likely coming to 884 Blooming Grove Turnpike located at the busy intersection of Route 94 and Old Temple Hill Road near the Vail’s Gate Post Office. Bearington Auto Care would replace an existing used car lot. Years ago this site was the long-time home of a recreational vehicle sales lot owned by New Windsor developer Casey Mann.

The New Windsor Planning Board discussed the potential traffic impacts of this project in-depth during a June meeting. Planning Board Chairman Jerry Argenio explained that since Route 94 is a state highway the New York State Department of Transportation would decide if a traffic light would be needed at the intersection of Old Temple Hill Road due to this project.

Greg Sgromo from Dunn & Sgromo Enginners a firm representing Bearington Auto Care explained that the gas station and convenience store would not be a specific destination that customers make a special trip to. Instead it would pull in traffic that is already passing by.

“The problem here is every traffic movement at Five Corners is an F level movement” Argenio explained “So everything we do within a quarter of a mile of that intersection we need to move with an abundance of caution.”

Planning Board member Harry Ferguson discussed the traffic on Old Temple Hill Road. “I’m

really concerned about the traffic. I know 4:00 I know with the buses not even rolling it’s still backed up.”

The Board voted unanimously to offer a conditional final approval contingent on site developers successfully receiving a permit by the DOT.

Another new project in the Five Corners area will be a self-storage facility located directly across from Old Temple Hill Road on Route 94. True Storage is proposed to be built at 865 Blooming Grove Turnpike. This plan is still in the works.

The MMCA Cheongju has held exhibitions suited to the study and display of the characteristics of its art storage center. This special exhibition is designed to provide new interpretations of the art storage center by focusing on its moving and opening of artworks.

Delivery in Art sheds light on delivery in contemporary society from the perspectives of art and art museums. The discovery of sea routes and the development of transportation trade and distribution have contributed to the birth of art museums. These transportation and distribution systems have been constantly updated to take on their present forms. Based on this history the exhibition focuses on the connection between movement and art/art museums. It intends to explore diverse aspects of the interfaces between one of the characteristic activities related to movement delivery and the major function of art museums exhibitions.

The exhibition is composed of three sections. Section I “Delivering the Art Museum” examines the MMCA’s public functions and roles by illuminating its various programs including exhibitions and education from the perspective of delivery. It shows traces of the MMCA’s public support projects and public function of diffusing art and culture and expanding connections with the public from the establishment of the Ministry of Culture in 1990 until now.

The Art Museum on the Move Project (1990–2009; renamed the Traveling Art Museum Project in 2001) and the Small Art Museum Project (which was performed at multiuse facilities from 1999 to 2007) were exhibitions delivered to various places. The Traveling Art Museum Education Project (2011–) is public support program that helps people appreciate and understand art in their daily lives outside the art museum. Moreover Art Bank (2005–) broadens the scope of art museum functions by contributing to the dissemination and popularization of art culture by promoting the loaning of artworks and supporting the holding of exhibitions. The MMCA Cheongju Art Storage Center that opened in 2018 was the first art storage facility something otherwise intended for preserving and managing artworks to be opened to the public in South Korea. In this exhibition Art Bank and the Art Storage Center have been interpreted within the framework of movement expansion and openness. In addition the MMCA has operated diverse public programs utilizing new types of communication including “Dear Art Museum on 30 Samcheong-ro.”

Section II “Art through Communication” introduces notable artworks from the twentieth century that experiment with transnational exchanges through the use of communication mediums. The development of cutting-edge communications technology led to interconnections communication and temporal and spatial transcendence. Many artists have fully applied the latest communications technology to their works and expanded the art field. By stretching the territory of delivery into communications and exchanges this section highlights the pioneering communication art.

By creating replicas of artworks and distributing them Marcel Duchamp’s Boîte-en-valise (Box in a Suitcase) (1941) caused a great sensation in an art world that otherwise emphasized originality and an aura of authority as did the Fluxus movement in the 1960s and 1970s. In a similar vein mail art producing works by using the postal system was an experimental attempt to obscure the distinction between art and life and depart from traditional art production methods by transmitting works and creating them jointly. The Global Art Fusion performance (1985) by Joseph Beuys Andy Warhol and Kaii Higashiyama was a transnational work of communication art in which artists on different continents exchanged messages of peace via facsimile. X1 X2 is a 1980s piece by Nam June Paik who experimented with the possibility of using televisions as interactive devices. It symbolizes the expansion of communication which is basic feature of correspondence. Electronic Café by Gum Nuri and Ahn Sang-soo from the 1990s was a space combining computer culture with an experimental artistic spirit. It shows monumental achievements of communication art using the early internet.

Section III “Delivery in the Form of Art” suggests new interpretations of delivery through the lens of art by presenting contemporary artworks that connect art with delivery in diverse manners. Delivery is not just physical movement but a medium for the interfaces between art and society. These include digital transmission circulation of art capitalism and up-to-date logistics systems. This section presents twenty works by ten Korean and international artists.

Section III begins with Provenance (2013) by Amie Siegel (US). It is a video work that back-traces the trading of furniture from the Indian city Chandigarh (which was planned by Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret). It captures transactions in artworks and their circulation routes under the artist’s contemplative and cinematic direction. Spirit and Opportunity (2021) by Song Sanghee reveals the dark side of capitalism through images drawn on blue Delftware tiles from the Netherlands. The images include animals killed in the wake of trade wars and the advancement of commerce into new continents and infectious diseases resulting from exchanges and migration. The FedEx Series (2022) by Walead Beshty (US) visually represents the transit of an artwork by shipping a glass box custom-made to fit within a standard-size FedEx box. It deliberately shows the damage and other marks resulting from a delivery process that inevitably involves rough handling by mail carriers. Friends in the Living Room (2022 ver.) by Bang & Lee reveals the movement of a message through optical fibers while works by Park Bona Ahn Kyuchul Cho Sohee Chun Kyungwoo Ham Kyungah and Michael Mandiberg enable viewers to perceive the delivery of art from multiple perspectives.

This exhibition themed around the concept of delivery extensively explores communication and openness the relationship between art and the transportation system and art/art museums and the public questioning essential functions of art. Art/art museums that were historically monopolized by powerful men have been opened to and shared with the public turning into public assets. This exhibition aims to search for new communication methods by designating the audience who serve as an important intermediary for art today as an exhibition delivery person. It is hoped that this exhibition will provide the audience with an opportunity to deliver meaningful artistic experiences by using their own tools and at their own speeds in a time when we are experiencing the fastest and most widespread movement in history.

The MMCA Cheongju plans to reorganize the visible storage spaces on the second floor to facilitate better appreciation of the art and will display masterpieces from the MMCA Lee Kun-hee Collection on three occasions from September 6 2022 through December of 2023. By removing the high walls and frames in the center of the visible storage and replacing the current glass with low-reflective versions it will offer an environment where the audience can pleasantly appreciate the art. The works on display will include Women and Jars by Kim Whanki in the first section two pieces including Shamanism by Park Saengkwang in the second section and Paradise by Paik Namsoon and Shangri-la by Lee Sangbeom in the third section together with archival materials.

Yun Bummo (Director of the MMCA) stated that Delivery in Art will provide an opportunity to re-examine the fundamental functions of art through diverse variations created when delivery a highly familiar word to contemporary people meets art.” He further expressed that he “hopes that it will inspire the search for new ways for the art museum to communicate with the audience a vital mediator that activates the art museum.” Moreover he mentioned that “the reorganization of the visible storage will solve issues involving the management of the Lee Kun-hee collection by enabling the preservation of the parts of the collection at risk of damage from long-term exposure to air at storage facilities with constant temperature and humidity and allow the appreciation of quintessence of Korean art through new viewing methods.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmci5jb20vcG9saXRpY3MvZmVkZXJhbC9nZW5kZXItcGF5LWdhcC1yZXBvcnRpbmctYS1kaXN0cmFjdGlvbi1yaWNoLWxpc3Rlci0yMDIyMDkwNC1wNWJmODnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jobs summit: Sam Kennard criticises push for large companies to publicly disclose gender pay gap,This article has been updated to correct employee information about Kennards Self Storage.

WESLEY CHAPEL FL — Life has been a struggle for 22-year-old Nazeraeh Montrond this past year.

Her father Army Sgt. Alberto Montrond was killed in February 2006 killed when an improvised explosive device detonated near his Humvee while he was stationed in Afghanistan with the 7th Special Forces Group. Then in March 2021 Montrond's mother Christl who had been struggling with health issues died leaving Montrond to care for her two younger brothers Kevyn and Bentley and sister Arabella while juggling a full-time job and full-time college course load at the University of South Florida in pursuit of her bachelor's degree in health science.

But thanks to the national nonprofit Building Homes for Heroes the Montronds no longer have to worry about a place to live. On Aug. 25 a day that's particularly special to the Montrond children because it's their mother's birthday they received the keys to a new home in the Centex community of Wesley Reserve at Chapel Crossings in Wesley Chapel.

Building Homes for Heroes in partnership with national home builder PulteGroup's Built to Honor program presented Montrond with the keys to a new fully furnished mortgage-free town home. The Montrond family’s new 1762 square-foot two-story town home features three bedrooms 2 1/2 bathrooms and a one-car garage. The master-planned community of Chapel Crossings gives residents access to a community pool with a lazy river clubhouse and fitness center.

“The story of Nazeraeh and her siblings has touched all of us” said Sean Strickler president of the West Florida Division of PulteGroup. “Everyone involved in this project knows what having this new home means for the family. We’re so proud to be involved and we hope Naz her brothers and sister make many new memories in their new home.” Building Homes for Heroes was founded by Andy Pujol after he volunteered in the search-and-rescue in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The organization builds and modifies homes to give mortgage-free to veterans and their families.

The nonprofit gives a home to veterans or their families about every 11 days. In September the organization will reach its milestone 300th home. This is the fifth home for Pulte's Built to Honor program in Tampa Bay since 2016. Launched in 2013 the program has built and donated more than 70 homes across the country.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Lopez 53 tapped Ralph Lauren for her three immaculate wedding gowns as well as her gold rehearsal dinner dress which features a plunging halter neckline and her post-wedding-brunch dress which boasts an allover stripe print and a high side slit.

The ruffled handkerchief dress she wore down the aisle was a reimagination of a turtleneck column sheath according to a press release from the brand. Complete with over 1000 handkerchiefs and 500 meters of fabric the ruffled cap sleeves and voluminous ruffle-tiered train were meant to evoke the romantic sensibility of the fashion house. The mermaid-style silhouette came complete with an open back and sheer 20-foot veil that began at the crown of her head and highlighted her slicked-back updo all the better to catch a glimpse of her Mikimoto pearl drop earrings.

Lopez then switched into a second gown that was completed by 30 artisans across 700 hours and essentially saw her dripping in pearls and Swarovski crystals all of which were strung onto micro-pleated silk tulle fabric and finished with the same earrings and a pair of Jimmy Choo Maisel sandals.

Lopez's final Ralph Lauren look also took a mermaid shape and spoke to her brand of sporty glamour with its sheer organza hood and keyhole neckline adorned with Swarovski crystals around the trim. For this moment Lopez accessorized with $2 million 27-carat one-of-a-kind pear-shaped drop flower marquise earrings from Samer Halimeh. Over the course of her wedding day she wore jewelry from Mikimoto as well including the aforementioned South Sea cultured pearl and diamond drop earrings a pearl and diamond floral ring and pearl and diamond studs.

Affleck 50 wore a classic tuxedo from Ralph Lauren consisting of a cream dinner jacket over a crisp white bib shirt with a boutonnière to match Lopez's intricate mossy green bouquet. His look was finished with black pleated slacks and patent loafers accented by a black bow tie.

The rest of the wedding party included Lopez's 14-year-old twins Max and Emme and Affleck's kids: Violet 16; Seraphina 13; and Samuel 10. The five children were also spotted wearing all white.

Lopez who also worked with Ralph Lauren on her memorable look for the 2021 Met Gala chose Zuhair Murad for her more intimate ceremony in Las Vegas on July 16 later changing into an Alexander McQueen dress at the chapel — a costume she had saved from the 2004 romantic comedy ""Jersey Girl"" which she starred in alongside Affleck.

For openers it's possible that the No. 25-ranked BYU Cougars will be the best team on USF's schedule — better than the Florida Gators or Louisville Cardinals better than any of the American Athletic Conference front-runners such as Houston Cincinnati and UCF.

BYU is a veteran team with 18 returning starters. The Cougars have size speed and guile. But when the Bulls examine what's required to beat BYU in Saturday's game at Raymond James Stadium the discussion should start with one player:

Cougars quarterback Jaren Hall a 6-foot-1 205 pounder.

He's on everyone's short list for the nation's best signal-callers. He passed for 2583 yards and 20 touchdowns in 10 starts in 2021 — and he didn't play in last season's 35-27 victory against the Bulls due to injury.

USF fans might remember the freshman version of Hall who got his first start on Oct. 12 2019 against the Bulls. Hall was 15-for-23 passing for 148 yards along with 83 yards rushing and a 29-yard score (he did not play in the fourth quarter due to injury and USF prevailed 27-23).

Hall is a problem.

""The hardest thing to prepare for as a defensive coach is a quarterback who can throw and run the traditional dual-threat quarterback'' USF first-year defensive coordinator Bob Shoop said. ""The quarterbacks who can run but can't throw create certain challenges. Quarterbacks who throw and can't run create certain challenges. But the guy who can do both is very very challenging for a defensive coach and a defensive unit.''

Shoop said he's confident that USF's defensive line will show significant improvement from last season when the Bulls' defense struggled to apply pressure (nine sacks all season). BYU's offense showed efficiency last season (55 red-zone trips 49 scores 41 touchdowns).

Shoop is wary of BYU's overall offensive talent. The Cougars have a pair of offensive linemen on the Outland Trophy and Lombardi Award watch lists — Blake Freeland (6-8 305) and Clark Barrington (6-6 305). Running back Tyler Algeier has graduated but BYU attracted Cal transfer Chris Brooks (6-1 230) who rushed for 1734 yards and 14 touchdowns in 40 games with the Golden Bears. BYU also has standout wide receivers in Gunner Romney (6-2 195) and Puka Nacua (6-2 205) but their availability for the opener has been questioned due to injuries.

""We've seen all the same things about Romney and Nacua'' Shoop said. ""I anticipate they're going to play but if they've don't if you follow their storyline during training camp some of their younger receivers really stepped up and had a great camp.

""They have a great connection between their quarterback and receivers. Whoever they have I don't think it's going to significantly change what they do. They're really good.''

And it all starts with Jaren Hall the BYU quarterback the focal point and the No. 1 priority for USF's defense.

Previous Meetings

USF and BYU are tied 1-1 in career meetings.

BYU downed USF 35-27 last Sept. 25 in Provo Utah. USF trailed 21-0 just 11 minutes into the game then outscored the Cougars 27-14 the rest of the way. USF's Jaren Mangham scored on a 1-yard run with 5:41 remaining to cap a 19-play 94-yard drive. But USF was out of timeouts and opted for an onside-kick attempt. BYU recovered and ran out the clock.

USF defeated BYU 27-23 in Tampa on Oct. 12 1979. On BYU's final drive the Cougars had third-and-10 at the USF 12-yard line but backup quarterback Baylor Romney was sacked for an 8-yard loss by linebacker Antonio Grier (one of seven current USF players to appear in the 2019 game). Romney's fourth-down pass attempt was incomplete.

Connections

It's a stretch to find commonalities between USF and BYU. The Cougars have one player from Florida — freshman wide receiver Dom Henry from Ponte Vedra Nease High School.

Trivia Time

From 1976-2019 BYU lost its first eight games in the state of Florida before finally winning. Which opponent did the Cougars defeat to end their 0-for-the-Sunshine-State streak?

Trickett Time

When the USF Bulls face the Cougars Saturday first-year Bulls offensive coordinator Travis Trickett will be calling plays for the first time since 2018.

""It's just like riding a bike'' Trickett said. ""It's nothing new.''

Trickett has seven seasons of play-calling experience during offensive-coordinator stints at Samford (2012-15) Florida Atlantic (2016) and Georgia State (2017-18). Trickett said the Bulls will be an attacking offense that will look to exploit matchups and get the ball in the hands of its playmakers.

Who will make those plays?

The game against BYU will be the first evidence of how Trickett plans to deploy his weapons. Veteran quarterback Gerry Bohanon  a transfer from Baylor who helped the Bears to last season's Big 12 Conference championship has a deep receiving corps led by holdovers Xavier Weaver  Jimmy Horn and Omarion Dollison  while featuring newcomers such as Khafre Brown (North Carolina) and Ajou Ajou (Clemson).

The running game is paced by powerful Jaren Mangham (671 yards and 15 touchdowns last season) and speedy Brian Battie  while Clemson transfer Michel Dukes should be a factor as well (holdover Kelley Joiner is injured and not expected back until mid-season).

Trickett's play-calling personality — from pace of play to what look he prefers on third-and-3 — will begin to reveal itself against BYU. However the game unfolds though Trickett emphasized that it's all about the USF players.

""You go over everything with a fine-tooth comb making sure your substitutions are right for whatever you want on certain plays'' said Trickett who works from the press box where the vantage point is generally better than field level. ""You're making sure that the play sequencing is what you want. You have the game plan and you get into a routine.

""Yeah you can get hot (while calling plays) but you're not playing. It's the kids. It's the players who are hot. What we have to do if they're hot is find ways to keep them hot (by calling favorable plays). If they're not hot you try to get them back on track.''

Feeling A Rush

Since USF hired Bob Shoop as defensive coordinator in December a major point of emphasis was improving the pass rush and getting more pressure on the quarterback (after registering just nine sacks in 2021).

With a combination of returning players and newcomers Shoop said he believes the Bulls will have a much-improved pass rush.

Shoop said he has been impressed with holdovers such as defensive tackle Rashawn Yates and defensive end Tramel Logan .

""We use the word 'havoc' — and that means tackles for a loss and sacks'' Shoop said. ""Those are areas we need to greatly improve from 2021.

""That's in the past. This is the 2022 version of the USF Bulls and any coach who is smart will identify the strengths of the individuals and place them in position to be successful. I think we're deeper at all the positions. We should be able to run a lot of guys out there and every one of those guys is expected to create havoc and create disruption. We entered the transfer portal and we're definitely deeper up front.''

Two of the most promising newcomers are defensive tackle Rashad Cheney (Minnesota) and defensive end Jatorian Hansford (Missouri). Cheney a one-time commitment to Alabama will bring some inside beef (he's 6-foot-2 285 pounds) while Hansford (6-4 265) combines power speed and desire on the edge.

""These guys have competed in the Big Ten and the SEC and they bring a lot of experience and maturity'' Shoop said. ""We're very fortunate to have them both. They had a big impact in the offseason and in the weight room. We're looking for big things from them.''

Looking Ahead

The Bulls face their lone Football Championship Subdivision opponent of the season next Saturday Sept. 10 when Howard University visits Raymond James Stadium. Howard which opened with a 23-13 defeat against Alabama State last week in Atlanta travels to Hampton University on Saturday night.

Howard's head coach is Larry Scott  who played on USF's inaugural team and was on the Bulls' offensive line from 1997-99. Scott also served as a USF assistant coach under Jim Leavitt and Skip Holtz through the 2012 season.

Scott's Howard staff includes Lindsey Lamar the Hillsborough High School product who became one of the top players in USF history (2009-12) and was named Big East Conference special teams player of the year in 2010. Former USF assistants Vernon Hargreaves and Troy Douglas are also on Howard's coaching staff.

By Valentina Cardona

As a busy twenty-something-year-old I barely have time for friends. With the hustle and bustle of life it is almost impossible to find time to do just about anything.

There is however one friend that I always have time for.

He is 75 pounds of muscle and hair and most certainly the best boy around. Arrow my two-year-old Collie and Labrador mixed sidekick burst into my life and instantly became inseparable. We spend all our free time together and always look for exciting ways to bond with one another.

While working at an event in downtown Tampa I was fortunate enough to stumble upon Two Shepherds Tap Room. Conveniently located four minutes from Raymond James Stadium Two Shepherds prides itself on being the first indoor and outdoor dog park and bar in Tampa.

It is important to be clear that this is not a dog bar. I had initial expectations of this business model being focused on “the dog” including serving dog-friendly beer or unique dishes for canines. However this tap room is quite literally “the perfect balance between a dog park and a chill lowkey bar” first-time visitor Jacob Woods said.

Two Shepherds features a quaint and cozy indoor bar beside a shockingly clean seated area separated by a latch gate leading to the indoor dog park. The space is decorated with magnificent paintings and murals of canines by Veronica Steiner and Travis Knight.

Two Shepherds also hosts weekly events including trivia and bingo nights and special events including Barktoberfest for anyone over 21 years old to enjoy — dog parent or not.

The selection of craft beers at Two Shepherds is vast however don’t expect to find an equally large variety for wine or seltzers.

My bartender recommended the 3 Daughters Brewing Raspberry Lemonade Cider considering my request for something “not too sweet just a little refreshing.”

This cider was the perfect balance between fruity and soothing with a little kick at the end. As I sipped on this drink I realized that I was completely surrounded by happy dogs playing everywhere.

It was heaven.

The outdoor area features a large lawn small tin pools and a large splash pad for all four-legged friends to enjoy. Parents were able to enjoy picnic tables comfortable seating and umbrellas while keeping an eye out on their pets. Socialization among both humans and canines was at an all-time high and all play was pleasantly under control.

After spending some time at Two Shepherds I came to the realization that this place deserves all the hype. Two Shepherds balances the atmosphere of a craft beer bar and a dog park perfectly where guests can relax and enjoy a night out.

Arrow and I will certainly be back and can’t wait to make memories with our new friends at Two Shepherds Taproom.

— BYU had to wait out a 2 1/2-hour weather delay to get its season started then took just 11 seconds to score its first touchdown.

Sep 3 2022 11:23 pm - AP",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvYnVsbHMvMjAyMi8wOS8wMy91c2ZzLW9wZW5pbmctbG9zcy10by1ieXUtYS10aHJvd2JhY2stdG8tdGhlLW1pc2N1ZXMtb2YtbGFzdC1zZWFzb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,USF's opening loss to BYU a throwback to the miscues of last season,"TAMPA — New quarterback new coordinators new transfers ... and the same old frustrated look for USF on Saturday night at Raymond James Stadium.

Far too often against BYU the Bulls resembled the squad that struggled through a 2-10 season in 2021 with a porous defense and an inconsistent offense.

After a 2 1/2-hour lightning delay the trauma started on the first play from scrimmage an end-around to BYU receiver Puka Nacua who ran unscathed for a 75-yard touchdown.

The play took 11 seconds.

It was pretty much downhill from there as No. 25 BYU beat the Bulls in almost every way possible en route to a 50-21 season-opening thrashing.

“I felt like we were prepared but obviously we weren’t” third-year USF coach Jeff Scott said. “… It was surprising that we couldn’t find much success on either side of the ball.”

It also may have been surprising to Bulls fans who had reason to be excited about many things entering this season: Legitimate designs for an on-campus stadium new offensive and defensive coordinators (Travis Trickett and Bob Shoop) 18 returning starters including the entire first-team offensive line and a slew of promising transfers most notably junior quarterback Gerry Bohanon who last year started 12 games for Big 12 champ Baylor and threw for 2200 yards.

None of it changed much of the play on the field Saturday.

With 8:44 left in the first quarter the Bulls trailed 14-0. Less than a minute later Bohanon threw a pick-six and it was all BYU in the half until the final 14 seconds.

The Bulls scored on a 1-yard dive play by Jaren Mangham and trailed 38-7 at intermission the air all but sucked out of the stadium.

The first-half offensive stats spoke volumes: BYU outgained USF 337 yards to 179.

“The game got away from us very quickly and then we got into a situation there where we had to throw a lot against a very good defense” said Scott who has a 3-19 overall record with only one victory against a Division I-A opponent (34-14 last year over Temple). “Offensively (BYU) was also very good. Their quarterback (Jaren Hall who completed 25 of 32 passes for 261 yards and two touchdowns) played very well and he had way too much time to throw.”

BYU’s final offensive stats — 575 total yards — reflected the Bulls’ 2021 defensive struggles when they ranked 123rd out of 130 teams allowing an average of 470 yards a game.

The Bulls also collected only one sack for minus-1 yard keeping pace with last year’s lack of pressure when USF finished tied for last in Division I-A with Vanderbilt collecting only nine total sacks in their 12 games.

“We have seen much more pressure in practice but it’s got to show up in the game” Scott said. “It makes it very difficult when you can’t put pressure on the quarterback. We have a lot of evaluate and we have to find ways to get better pressure.”

There were bright spots for the Bulls including an 89-yard kickoff return for a touchdown by Jimmy Horn to start the second half a solid night for receiver Xavier Weaver (five catches for 113 yards) and a couple of decent drives engineered by Bohanon.

Bohanon who finished 17-of-30 for 172 yards and an interception was anything but pleased.

“I just felt like we weren’t focused” Bohanon said. “I felt like we never got in the right mindset the right intensity. We kind of came out flat and waited for the game to come to us rather than us attacking.”

Overall USF finished with 293 total yards and Mangham led the Bulls’ rushers with 10 carries for 39 yards.

BYU’s top back Christopher Brooks often ran through huge holes behind the Cougars’ powerful line finishing with 13 carries for 135 yards including a 52-yard touchdown run.

From SUPER to Ti – the last-minute change from NVIDIA.

Over at NGA forums there is a picture of RTX 3090 SUPER Founder Edition. This model is likely an early engineering sample that was later replaced with RTX 3090 Ti SKU. This could be the only proof that NVIDIA ever wanted to launch RTX 30 SUPER series. Instead the company opted for a few Ti series such as RTX 3080Ti/3070Ti and later 3090 Ti.

The interesting part here is the black cooler instead of the silver frame that ended up on the final RTX 3090 Ti Founders Edition design. If all RTX 30 SUPER models were to feature such a color then NVIDIA would basically do their Radeon RX 6×50XT counterparts with the same design goal.

According to the leaked GPU-Z screenshot supposedly showing the same card it features the same full GA102 GPU with 10752 CUDA cores and even the same ID as RTX 3090 TI. In fact the card is recognized as the RTX 3090 Ti model which makes sense considering it was the last-minute rebranding from NVIDIA.

Furthermore MEGASizeGPU posted pictures of one of the very few known GeForce RTX 3080 cards with 20 GB memory. This model appeared in many leaked roadmaps but has never been released either. It is just another proof of how many changes graphics cards go through before release. The card posted by the leaker is the MSI Ventus 3X OC model:

As Wccftech spotted the flagship RTX 3090 Ti actually hit $1100 for an EVGA model at Newegg although unfortunately that has now sold out. However at the time of writing there is still an RTX 3090 Ti Ultra Gaming graphics card from EVGA (with a faster boost speed than the base model) available at Newegg for $1150 which is $50 cheaper than the recent low we saw for this GPU (when sold direct by the manufacturer itself).

As for the RTX 3090 the same Ultra Gaming version of that graphics card from EVGA has been cut to $960 (again this is in stock at least as we write this).

And we’ve seen the lowest price yet for the RTX 3080 Ti which can now be had for $800 from Newegg (another EVGA product) and it’s even cheaper at Best Buy where there’s a 3080 Ti from MSI sitting at $740.

That MSI RTX 3080 Ti price tag represents a drop of 31% and remember the base model of the EVGA RTX 3090 Ti has come down from an MSRP of $2150 to sit at $1100 which is very close to half-price now in the US.

Chunky price cuts are being implemented in other regions too and for example in the UK you can now pick up an RTX 3080 Ti for £849. As Wccftech further observes in China some of Nvidia’s high-end Ampere models have price tags which are around 35% to 45% below MSRP and even further down the RTX 3000 range there’s 10% to 15% being shaved off recommended prices.

It seems clear enough that asking prices are hitting fresh lows – certainly in the case of the 3080 Ti and Ampere GPUs above that – but before you rush to add a product to your cart you might want to bear in mind that even deeper discounts are thought to be on the horizon.

This prediction comes courtesy of the Taiwan Economic Daily which foresees price cutting action that will “far exceed” the movement we’ve witnessed last month and indeed this latest batch of price drops is certainly in line with that forecast. Note that AMD pricing is said to be dropping too and there’s already evidence of this as well with the likes of the RX 6900 XT now down to $700 in the US and some 40% below its MSRP in China.

With bigger falls to come we can envisage the RTX 3090 Ti dropping below the thousand buck mark and there’s the further prospect of some seriously good value deals on RTX 3080 models meaning that being patient could pay off handsomely. Although bear in mind that these deals will only become so tempting because they need to be before more powerful RTX 4000 models arrive in town – and RDNA 3 GPUs for AMD too of course. However Nvidia in particular needs to shift that current-gen stock with some speed as we’ve been hearing on a regular basis of late.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd2NjZnRlY2guY29tL252aWRpYXMtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtMzA5MC10aS1hbG1vc3QtbGF1bmNoZWQtYXMtdGhlLXJ0eC0zMDkwLXN1cGVyLWFzLWxlYWstcmV2ZWFscy_SAWtodHRwczovL3djY2Z0ZWNoLmNvbS9udmlkaWFzLWdlZm9yY2UtcnR4LTMwOTAtdGktYWxtb3N0LWxhdW5jaGVkLWFzLXRoZS1ydHgtMzA5MC1zdXBlci1hcy1sZWFrLXJldmVhbHMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 3090 Ti Almost Launched As The RTX 3090 SUPER As Leak Reveals,"NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 3090 Ti is an interesting graphics card given the fact that it's the flagship of the lineup but there's more to its backstory than that.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 SUPER Leak Shows How The Green Team Changed Its Flagship Graphics Card At The Last Minute

The leak over at NGA.178 Forums shows an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 SUPER graphics card which has the same design and specifications as NVIDIA's flagship GeForce RTX 3090 Ti graphics card. The only major difference is the branding which we know was only used for the RTX 20 ""SUPER"" series lineup.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 SUPER Graphics Card Picture:

The user states that while the card is the same triple-slot Founders Edition behemoth that the RTX 3090 series are the design is slightly different with a metal frame with a slightly pure-black color scheme and it also has a different fan compared to the one found on the RTX 3090 Ti. The GPU-z reports the card as the RTX 3090 Ti with the same specifications of 10752 CUDA cores 1860 MHz boost speeds 24 GB GDDR6X VRAM running across a 384-bit bus at 21 Gbps for a total of 1008.4 GB/s bandwidth.

The card also has the same BIOS version as the RTX 3090 Ti Founders Edition so there's virtually no difference besides the cooler and the branding of the SUPER variant. It looks like this could be one of the early engineering samples that the user managed to acquire from the Chinese black market space which is filled with such rare hardware products. Another similar rare product is the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 20 GB which was produced in limited quantities as spotted by the user:

https://twitter.com/Zed__Wang/status/1566440608515760128

The fact that this card is titled as the NVIDIA ""GeForce RTX 3090 SUPER"" and not the ""RTX 3090 Ti"" may indicate that the green team had at some point plans to brand this card under the ""SUPER"" line considering it was their true flagship but decided to go with the ""Ti"" branding at the end. We know that the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti was amongst one of the first Ampere graphics cards to leak all the way back in 2020 and even after being finally announced at CES 2022 the card saw a big delay which pushed it back to the end of March.

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti was launched at an MSRP of $1999 US but can now be found in the retail segment for just $1099 US & will soon be under $1000 US given the price cuts that are happening in the GPU market.

By using the new rendering techniques of Unreal Engine 5 Funkyzeit Games has basically recreated the first map of Super Mario Bros. However and contrary to other remakes this one lets Mario explore the environment. Not only that but there are some cool physics/destruction sequences.

The end result is nowhere near the cartoony graphics of the Mario games. While this fan project manages to retain its art style it looks more like an early 90s CG Mario game.

Anyway I personally find it cool. Yes this demo is rough around the edges and needs more polish. However it’s better than your usual “UE5 fan remakes“.

Speaking of Unreal Engine 5 we also suggest taking a look at the following videos. Right now you can download a Superman UE5 Demo a Halo 3: ODST Remake and a Spider-Man UE 5 Demo. Moreover these videos show Resident Evil Star Wars KOTOR and Counter-Strike Global Offensive in UE5. Additionally you can find a Portal Remake and an NFS3 Remake. And finally here is a Half Life 2 Fan Remake an Oblivion fan remake a World of Warcraft remake a Skyrim remake a Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Remake a Doom 3 Remake and a Zelda Ocarina of Time UE5 Remake a God of War Remake and a GTA IV Remake

Enjoy!

But in the meantime the company is revealing benchmarks for what might be the most powerful GPU in the series the Arc A770.

The company posted the benchmarks in a Thursday video talking up the Arc A770’s ray-tracing capabilities which can render realistic lighting and shadow effects in games.

The benchmarks pit the Arc A770 against Nvidia’s RTX 3060 in 17 games running at 1080p with the ray-tracing graphics turned on. The results show Intel’s GPU can significantly outshine Nvidia’s product in most of the games but not all.

The benchmarks showing the improvement gains/declines by percentages.

Overall the Arc A770 averaged 13% in higher frame rates over the RTX 3060. The Intel GPU excelled the most in games including Fortnite and Metro Exodus posting 56% and 31% increase in performance respectively.

Benchmarks showing performance by FPS. Ghostwire Tokyo saw a 25% improvement after an Intel driver update.

However the Arc A770 lost to the RTX 3060 in four games including F1 2022 Guardians of the Galaxy Battlefield V and Deathloop although Intel says it's still working on new drivers to improve the gaming performance over the Arc GPUs.

""It's early days for us and things are going to continue to get better"" said Intel graphics fellow Tom Petersen in the video.

The company also showed another benchmark of the Arc A770 at a 1440p resolution. But this time the GPU was running with both ray tracing and Intel’s game-boosting XeSS technology turned on to increase the frame rates even more.

The benchmarks by frame per second.

The benchmark only covered five games but as you can see the XeSS technology can make a huge difference on performance.

The results suggest the Arc A770 will end up competing against Nvidia’s slightly more powerful RTX 3060 Ti graphics card which currently retails for $449 and up. Intel is also preparing the Arc A750 which can trade blows with the RTX 3060 according to Intel’s own benchmarks. But it remains unclear how much the company plans on pricing the higher-end Arc GPUs.

In the meantime Newegg has quietly been selling Intel’s Arc A380 graphics card in the US for $139. But one main challenge facing the Arc graphics cards is how they can struggle to produce high frame rates for games built with the older DirectX11 and DirectX9 gaming APIs. This may cause many consumers to steer clear of the products especially when Nvidia and AMD are preparing to release next-generation GPUs in the coming months."

At the same time President of the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) Professor Benedict Oramah who said there could also be a routine service within the next five years pledged financial support for the establishment of a regular air link between the two regions and indicated that the region could become home to African-based commercial banks.

These were among the areas for concrete action coming out of the first ever AfriCaribbean Trade and Investment Forum being held at the Lloyd Erskine Sandiford Centre at which a major talking point was the need for an air link between Africa and the Caribbean as well as increased investment and trade.

During a press conference on Friday evening day two of the three-day conference Prime Minister Mottley said she was unable to give an exact start date for the chartered flights but assured that action was forthcoming.

“The reality is that we have started more serious conversations than I have seen before and as recent as [Thursday] evening my Ministry of Tourism and International Transport met with a number of persons from the Bank and from other countries. We are trying to see how best we can create a framework that will allow for charters first if necessary.

“Barbados has indicated that we are prepared to work with one or two African countries to be able to do the co-marketing because you have to be able to sustain the traffic and we hope we can look at anchoring maybe a city out of North America as well to help with the traffic load” Mottley explained adding that carrying cargo would also help to reduce the cost of the travel between the two regions.

“So I am hopeful that within a few months we can make a reality of this pipedream that has been spoken about.”

Contending that it was wrong for people to have to obtain a transit visa through North Atlantic countries to come to the Caribbean from Africa and vice versa Mottley said: “If we have not just a sense of history but an appreciation for the economic activity that it will unlock then I think that the key in this case will be well made. But like with any child we must creep before we walk; and like with new routes we need to support it for the first year or two until it can sustain itself.”

Meanwhile Oramah indicated that Afreximbank was ready to help with the necessary financing of the air link while stating that he believed a regular service could become reality in less than five years.

Noting that Mottley’s determination will help bring about the change he added: “And you have a bank like Afreximbank that says ‘good ideas that come we are not going to use the standard ways of assessing their credit’.”

Earlier in the day Minister of Tourism and International Transport Senator Lisa Cummins indicated that talks were advancing to have a direct air link through RwandAir Etihad Airways Ethiopian Airways and Kenya Airways.

“We have already signed air services agreements with Kenya and Ghana. We should be signing further air services agreements with our partners as we move forward and that in itself will then lend to negotiations with our commercial partners” she said.

However acknowledging that there would need to be demand for the airlines to travel between Africa and the Caribbean Cummins said discussions around trade and investment were critical.

Responding to questions from reporters on Friday Prime Minister Mottley also indicated there will be a television programme exchange between Barbados and African countries.

She said she will be seeking to have the state-owned Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) engage in an information exchange agreement with television stations in Africa to facilitate the transfer of locally-produced content. This she said will then be extended throughout the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).

The Prime Minister also indicated that she was hopeful of cooperation between Barbados and Egypt in the area of tourism and financial services noting that discussions have already started on tourism.

During the conference a number of trade and investment agreements were signed between Caribbean countries and companies and their African counterparts.

In the coming weeks and months Afreximbank which is headquartered in Egypt is expected to send a mission to CARICOM to “understand the market and develop a plan so that we begin to deal with the low-hanging fruits” according to Oramah.

He also announced that they would be looking at the possibility of establishing an African-based commercial bank in the Caribbean.

“We will tackle the capital problem aggressively and one of the things we discussed with Prime Minister Mottley is making sure that apart from us [Afreximbank] that we bring commercial banks here. We need Africans to have control of the banking system here. That is the only way more Caribbean business persons can have access to credit . . . . Once we begin to deal with that other things will follow” he said.

The port of Rosyth is the current headquarters of Babcock International Group the company responsible for the construction of Polish Navy frigates as part of the “Miecznik” programme for the Polish government. ORP Orzeł became famous fleeing from internment in Estonia and sailing without either navigation or maps to Scotland. One of the most notable successes of ORP Orzeł was sinking the transporter ""Rio de Janeiro"" carrying German troops within the Weserübung operation to Norway. The information provided by ""Orzel"" was crucial in indicating the German invasion of Norway.

The short film includes commentaries from Roger Pickering – a historian one of the initiators of the ORP Orzeł Memorial in Scotland Patrick Carnie – a strategist from Babcock International Group in Rosyth and Ric Dekkers a retired captain of the Dutch Navy currently adviser to the Damen Naval Shipbuilding Group which originally built ORP just before World War II. Subsequently Consul General Łukasz Lutostański provides a commentary on the unwavering cooperation between the Polish and British Navy. The film uses numerous archival photos from the collections of Damen Naval the Naval Museum in Gdynia the Sikorski Institute in London as well as some archival recordings from the Polish Radio i.e. statements of one of the sailors from December 1939 who talks about the circumstances of a dramatic escape from Tallinn to Rosyth. The film also features many contemporary shots of the Firth of Forth which was used by ORP Orzeł when going on patrols in the North Sea.

Numerous guests were present at the premiere of the film including our main partners of the ORP Orzeł Memorial Project Babcock International Group and Fife County representatives as well as the Regional Commander of the Royal Navy. Also present that evening were representatives of Polish Saturday schools and other organizations such as the Historical Club in Glasgow the Veterans Memorial Group the Social and Educational Society in Glasgow the Polish Club in Kirkcaldy the Polish Association in Aberdeen the Scottish Polish Cultural Association MAPA Trust as well as Polish Ex-Servicemen’s Club (SPK) in Edinburgh.

Following the screening and a historical talk by the Consul General Łukasz Lutostański on the contribution of the Polish Navy in the fight against the Third Reich alongside the Royal Navy Hubert Jando from the Research Centre of Naval Techniques presented his trials and chances of finding the ORP Orzeł at the bottom of the North Sea.

The event ended with an official presentation of the trailer of “Orzeł. The last patrol” the latest Polish film by Aura Films on the story of the submarine which upon the initiative of the Consulate General in Edinburgh will be shown in Scotland later this year."

From Robert Morris University Athletics Department report

On a rainy Sunday afternoon the Robert Morris University women’s soccer team defeated Hampton in dominant fashion with a 7-1 victory at the North Athletic Complex.

With the victory the Colonials stay unbeaten as they improve to 3-0-2 overall while the Lady Pirates fall to 1-4-0 this season. Robert Morris scored the fourth most goals in a game in program history while scoring the most since 2002 when the Colonials tallied eight against Youngstown State.

“I was very pleased with our performance today. I thought we got off to a slow start but we made a few substitutions who made an immediate impact” head coach Chris Shaw said. “It’s great to have a bench with players that can come in and change the game and that’s what we got today.”

In the first half Robert Morris recorded four goals in a four-minute span. After a Hampton foul inside the box freshman Elisa Corvalan recorded her second goal of the season after converting a penalty kick to give the Colonials a 1-0 lead in the 25′. Less than two minutes later Robert Morris extended its lead when senior Gabriella Lecuona put a cross into the box and Paloma Swankler found the right side of the net for her first collegiate goal.

The Colonials took a 3-0 advantage at the 28:13-mark when Lecuona took a shot from the top of the box and beat the keeper to the top right corner of the net. Just 45 seconds later Lecuona placed a shot inside the box that was redirected by Swankler who gave the Colonials a 4-0 lead and her second goal of the game. Robert Morris registered 10 shots seven of them on goal in the first half.

The Colonials picked up where they left off in the second half when redshirt freshman Morgan Guelas took a corner kick from Malia Kearns and found graduate student Chelsea Kingston to give Robert Morris a 5-0 advantage. At the 55:42-mark freshman Renae Mohrbacher dribbled up the right side and delivered a pass to Kearns who placed a shot to the right corner of the net 6-0. In the 69′ minute the Lady Pirates committed a foul inside the box which led to senior Angela Van Damia converting the penalty kick and extending the Colonial lead to 7-0.

Hampton was able to avoid the shutout in the 89′ when Nyle Nwainokpor found the right side of the net.

MOORESVILLE — West Rowan’s halftime adjustments and inspirational speeches went right out the window when Mooresville sophomore Tiquan Cromartie returned the second-half kickoff for a touchdown.

Cromartie’s 89-yard burst of speed up the middle of the field was the single biggest play on Friday in Mooresville’s 35-14 win over West Rowan at Joe Popp Stadium.

Mooresville coached by former West head man Joe Nixon won the turnover battle won the trench battle thanks mostly to 310-pound defensive tackle Xzavier Booker and won the scoreboard battle.

The Falcons (2-1) dazzling offensively in their first two games were goose-egged in the second half.

West quarterback Lucas Graham threw for huge yards again (301 of them) but the tradeoff was four interceptions by the Blue Devils (2-1).

Mooresville was able to stuff West’s physical running game and then was able to bring a lot of heat on Graham.

West’s power back Landon Jacobs topped 100 yards in West’s victories against Salisbury and Davie to begin the season. He had 18 for 38 on Friday. Eleven of those 18 runs were no-gains or TFLs.

Mooresville’s offense — uptempo and balanced — proved difficult to stop.

QB Jamere Cherry threw for 170 yards on 10 completions and hit a big TD to Terrell Simonton. Jawarn Howell (21 carries 105 yards) and Kyjuan Westmoreland (9 carries 71 yards) formed a productive rushing duo. Westmoreland scored twice while Howell found the end zone once.

Mooresville rolled to a touchdown on its first possession. Howell broke loose on a fourth-and-1 play from the West 18.

In early trouble inside its 10-yard line. West got a couple of breaks — two key receptions on tipped balls. Paxton Greene’s 53-yard deflected catch got the Falcons moving and Adrian Stockton out-jumped defenders for a 26-yard touchdown and a 7-all tie.

Mooresville scored in the first minute of the second quarter.

West came right back with Evan Kennedy turning a pass over the middle into a 64-yard sprint to the end zone. Juan Arteaga’s PAT made it 14-all with 9:54 left in the second quarter but the Falcons wouldn’t score again.

The Cherry-to-Simonton quick strike put Mooresville ahead 21-14.

It got wild in the final minute of the first half. West had a field goal blocked and Mooresville scooped it for a long return.

Lee Vaughters intercepted a pass to stop the Blue Devils. Then Mooresville got a pick to close the half.

West had a meager 9 rushing yards at halftime but was still very much in the game.

Even after that kickoff return to begin the second half put the Falcons down 28-14 they had a fighting chance.

The beginning of the end was a determined West push that moved the ball all the way down to the Mooresville 2. But Mooresville blew up two straight running plays for the stop.

Then the Falcons’ defense had Mooresville contained but an unsportsmanlike flag kept the Blue Devils’ offense on the field.

When Mooresville cashed in on that penalty for a Westmoreland 16-yard TD for a 35-14 lead it was all over.

There was a lot of time left but there no longer was any doubt about the outcome.

Now West has to regroup.

Undefeated North Rowan comes to Mount Ulla on Friday for West’s home opener. West beat North in a thriller in 2021.

WWE Clash at the Castle: Matt Riddle on blurring lines with Rollins rivalry how life is different under Triple H and more

Former MMA star Matt Riddle takes on Seth Rollins at WWE's Clash at the Castle today after the rivalry between the pair hit new peaks with Rollins calling out Riddle's home life in a blunt backstage promo on this week's Raw.

The pair are set to meet in the ring today in the culmination of what seems to have become an extremely personal feud.

Speaking exclusively to The Mirror ahead of the bout Riddle said: ""I don't want to get too much into the specifics. But everybody's talking about it in that they don't know if it's real or not whether we like each other or not.

""That's what I've done ever since I started wrestling that was my goal. I like blurring those lines. Whether it's Goldberg or Roman or anybody I'm working with I'm going to stir the pot so people are like 'wait is that real? Did they not like each other?' That sells tickets and as far as I'm concerned that's why I'm valuable.""

A video - posted by PPV-Tahoe on Instagram - showed an unidentified man and woman stealing a load of designer purses and a basket full of shoes.

In the video alarm bells can be heard going off as a man in a white shirt can be seen languidly browsing through the rack of purses before he casually walks off with what appears to be a few Michael Kors bags.

A woman who is with him can be seen carrying a decorative laundry basket full of shoes out the door of a Peoria Arizona store according to PPV-Tahoe.

Customers did not seem alarmed by the brazen thieves and kept shopping like nothing was happening.

Even the manager who appeared to be standing near the rack did not largely engage with the thieves.

One Ross employee ran outside after the pair and appeared to throw a rock at them but that didn't stop them.

It is unclear if the incident was reported to police or how much they stole in merchandise. Employees from both Ross stores in Peoria told DailyMail.com that they were unaware of the incident.

Robberies across the country have risen especially in New York City where a gang of seven thieves was seen calmly leaving a Lululemon store with $30000 worth of items.

Seven thieves believed to be aged from 30 to 50 years old entered the store on 14th Street and 9th Avenue with empty carts and laundry bags while the guard casually glanced over as they grabbed piles of clothing on August 16.

The brazen robbers targeting the posh West Village neighborhood rushed out of the store with their finds - without being apprehended by the security guard.

Store surveillance footage showed the thieves walk in and out of the store around noon - looting thousands of dollars worth of merchandise as the seemingly unbothered guard dressed in a white shirt and black tie stood by.

According to Burlington County prosecutors a preliminary investigation has found that Peter Lestician's body was discovered on Friday by two men riding four-wheelers along an ATV trail in Clearfield County Pennsylvania.

PA State Police were called to an abandoned barn in Cooper Township around 4 p.m. and found his body in the front seat of a locked vehicle.

PA State Police listed Lestician's death as a suicide.

Lestician 53 was a person of interest in the death of his longtime girlfriend Sheila Maguire 54 who was found dead in her Florence home on Monday. While authorities say he was possibly the last person to see Maguire alive no charges had been filed against Lestician and prosecutors say there is no direct evidence linking him to the homicide.

Investigators say they are working with the district attorney's office in Pennsylvania to gain permission to search the vehicle and confirm the body's identity. The Burlington County Prosecutor's Office says it will continue to investigate Maguire's homicide.

An autopsy found that Maguire was killed by blunt force trauma to her head at her home on Birch Hollow Drive prosecutors say. Maguire and Lestician lived together at the home. Maguire's daughters requested police to make a wellness check at the home Monday after not hearing from their mother for several days according to prosecutors.

Previous reports said that Lestician had not been seen since last weekend. Prosecutors confirmed that he had not made contact with any family members since Aug. 26.

Maguire's social media posts say that the couple met around eight years ago when Lestician was a coach for her daughter's softball team. He led Hightstown High School to its first state title in his second year as coach and was named NJ.com's Softball Coach of the Year in 2019.

Shoppers are changing their behavior as the US braces for the possibility of a recession.

Dollar stores and value-focused brands like Walmart Costco and Burlington stand to benefit.

But higher-end department stores and mid-range brands already seeing slower sales could take a hit.

Some of America's best-known retailers may have a tough road ahead if the US enters a recession.

After months of sky-high inflation shoppers are making different decisions about what they buy and where they buy it. Some retailers particularly discount chains could benefit from these spending shifts and luxury retailers will mostly be insulated. But mid-range retailers are already feeling the pinch — and things may only get more challenging if the economy worsens.

Of course there are still mixed signals right now about how the economy is really doing. Inflation isn't as high as it was in June but it's still high enough to make it harder for people to pay rent or fill up their gas tanks. Job openings are declining and many companies particularly tech firms are laying off employees in droves.

But the US economy isn't technically in a recession yet and experts are split on what the future will bring. Goldman Sachs says a recession is unlikely in the next year and the National Bureau of Economic Research the small but powerful think tank that essentially decides whether we're in a recession hasn't declared it so.

Still some economists — and Senator Elizabeth Warren — believe a downturn is coming possibly in 2023 as a result of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate increases.

Either way consumer sentiment is lower now than it was in the early months of the pandemic and spending has shifted. Those changes could make or break certain fortunes in the world of retail.

Some retailers are set up to benefit during a recession

When times get tough consumers often start trading down to cheaper goods abandoning some of the more expensive or mid-range products and brands they previously favored.

Walmart and Target executives noted earlier this year that more shoppers had been switching to cheaper private-label goods — products manufactured under brands owned by the retailer — instead of brand names.

Some shoppers are going further and trading down to cheaper retailers.

Mark Cohen director of retail studies at Columbia University described this period of trading down as a ""bonanza"" for stores like Walmart Costco TJ Maxx Burlington Ross and dollar stores all of which position themselves as offering more value for consumers.

In fact Dollar Tree and Dollar General reported an influx of higher-income customers during their most recent quarters with the majority of new Dollar Tree customers during the past year coming from households making at least $80000 a year CEO Mike Witynski said during the company's second-quarter earnings call.

The same is true at higher income brackets. Walmart has seen a market share gain thanks to shoppers from households making $100000 annually while Chipotle said it's seeing more rich people than usual buying burritos.







Other retailers could face challenging times ahead

Both Macy's and Nordstrom recently reported that they're seeing weaker customer spending which both companies expect to persist for the rest of 2022.

The issue for those brands is that they're caught in the middle: their customers will pull back spending in the face of high inflation but they likely won't see enough wealthier customers filling the gap Cohen said.

""These middle players the middle to better players like Macy's and Nordstrom are kind of trapped"" he said.

Beyond the department stores mid-range retailers are feeling the pinch. Gap reported a challenging quarter for Old Navy and Athleta and lowered its guidance for the year. Abercrombie & Fitch also lowered its sales outlook for the year and noted that inflation is hitting Hollister hard. And at Urban Outfitters customers are split: affluent shoppers are still spending at Anthropologie and Free People while for Urban's ""younger and less affluent"" customers inflation has been ""economically crippling"" CEO Richard Hayne told analysts during the company's quarterly earnings call.

According to Cohen the best way to tell how a retailer might perform during tough times is by looking at the changes it made during the early months of the pandemic. Agility and flexibility will win the day he said.

""This is yet another test of leadership as we look toward a second half which has got this inflationary spiral that most consumers haven't experienced in their adult lifetime"" Cohen said. ""I suspect there's going to be a whole round of restructures bankruptcies all sorts of upheaval as we approach the end of the year into next year."""

The nine-month Ultimate World Cruise is billed as the longest world cruise in history and it will take place aboard Royal Caribbean International’s 962-foot Serenade of the Seas visiting all seven continents and hitting over 150 destinations in more than 60 countries. Deep inside the ship’s belly powering it throughout its voyage will be GE technology.

Readers of GE Reports are familiar with this tech: a powerful gas turbine that uses a jet engine (thus their name “aeroderivative”) modified to generate energy. Based on the CF6 engine which powers Air Force One and many Boeing planes this year the aeroderivative turbine — GE calls it the LM2500 — surpassed 100 million operating hours. These turbines are used all over the world in applications such as mobile power oil and gas and the manufacture of various products. They’re also helping U.S. utilities to transition away from coal and bring more renewables online. And they even power seagoing vessels — including some of the world’s largest ships.

Among them are the 1132-foot Queen Mary 2 the only remaining true ocean liner in the world which employs two of the turbines working in tandem with diesel generators. Beyond that 40 navies in the world use them on 600 of their ships — from Italian aircraft carriers to U.S. Navy destroyers to frigates in the Royal Thai Navy. And Royal Caribbean Group which is not alone among cruise operators uses the engine on eight ships across its Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises cruise lines. Royal Caribbean Group in fact is one of the top global fleet operators of LM2500 gas turbines with 24 turbines total — two per ship on its eight ships plus eight spares.

But the Serenade of the Seas is special. The 2490-guest cruise ship first set sail in 2003 — with Whoopi Goldberg as its “godmother” — and it’s sailed through the Caribbean into the Baltic and from Seattle to Alaska. Because of its track record and the onboard experiences it has to offer it was the ship that Royal Caribbean chose for the record-setting voyage.

“The fact that out of all 64 of their ships they’re choosing this ship to be the flagship vessel for this around-the-world cruise I think that’s pretty awesome” says Albert Whiteside an engineer and senior sales manager with GE Power who manages the Royal Caribbean Group account along with Barbara Beck customer service leader.

Until about 2000 diesel engines dominated the cruise industry. The introduction of gas turbines has allowed companies to continue to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur oxide emissions. The turbines also require less engine room space and have comparably lower noise and vibrations for a more pleasant experience for guests and crew members.

This spring Whiteside traveled to the Bahamas to observe an extensive upgrade of the ship’s control system which runs the Serenade’s combined-cycle power plant. The culmination of talks that began in 2018 the upgrade project was managed by GE and executed in partnership with GE’s FieldCore business control systems designer Woodward and energy technology company Bently Nevada. The combined gas turbine and steam turbine integrated electric drive system (COGES) arrangement features two GE LM2500+ gas turbine generators and one steam turbine generator which together provide 59 megawatts for both main ship propulsion and all onboard power generation needs.

Another big reason why cruise companies use these turbines is their reliability. They are operated by advanced control systems that aim to ensure that the ship operates efficiently and safely. “We love the reliability of GE LM2500+ gas turbines its durable design and low downtime. In case of planned — or in rare cases unplanned — work we can replace the entire engine in 12 hours” says Anders Aasen vice president of global marine operations for Royal Caribbean Group. “This makes it a dream for every engineer on board.”

We’ve got coverage across the major cruise lines as Carnival gets strict Norwegian makes a huge switch and plenty of changes from Royal Caribbean.

In this week’s roundup we’ve got a mixture of news across the major cruise lines but one of the most significant stories is about Carnival Cruise Line starting to get strict with guests which we will go into shortly.

There’s also coverage on a new thrilling ride for the new MSC cruise ship plenty of changes from Royal Caribbean including the huge development with Starlink. Norwegian Cruise Line makes a major switch and Virgin Voyages prepares for a new loyalty program.

MSC Reveals New Robotic Ride

MSC Cruises has revealed the first-ever robotic arm ride at sea for its new cruise ship the MSC Seascape.

The amusement ride named ROBOTRON which has three seats suspended from a robotic arm will propel guests in all directions and flip them upside down while flying at 175 feet above sea level hanging over the edge of the deck.

Riders can select their own thrill level and speed from family-friendly fun to the ultimate high-intensity thrills. Guests can also set the mood with their choice of music lights and much more.

Behind them will be a giant video screen where the rhythm and bass are visualized while the robotic arm bounces and twists with the music.

MSC Cruises announced even more thrill rides besides ROBOTRON focusing on virtual reality 3D and simulation-type games. The flight simulator will be a 360-degree virtual reality ride where guests can choose from various worlds.

The VR Motorcycles will be a VR experience where guests can ride a motorbike complete with special effects such as wind and water splashes. There’s also the MSC Formula Racer and an Immersive XD 3D Cinema.

The 169000 gross ton MSC Seascape will be setting sail on November 19 from Italy. Her first cruise will be a 17-night Grand Voyage which ends in New York City for her inauguration. The ship will eventually be operating year-round Eastern and Western Caribbean cruises from PortMiami from December 7 2022.

Carnival Cruise Line Gets Strict

In a surprising change to its Minor Guest Policy that applies to passengers under 21 years of age Carnival Cruise Line has instituted an onboard youth curfew fleetwide. The curfew will only apply to guests 17 years of age and younger and goes into effect immediately.

This means that “Guests 17 years of age and under who are not accompanied by an adult in their traveling party 21 years of age or older must be clear of all public areas by 1:00am each evening unless involved in a Club 02 or Circle C teen activity.”

Carnival Cruise Line brand ambassador John Heald clarified the consequences of violating this new policy Heald said “Any guest in violation of the curfew or whose behavior contradicts our rules could be disembarked in the next port at their own expense and not be allowed to have a cruise with us again.”

This change comes just days after Carnival Cruise Line updated its “Know Before You Go” information that is sent to guests before their cruise. In the documentation the cruise line reminds guests to respect others onboard noise in the hallways is kept to a minimum guests follow queues and that a spirit of community and neighborliness is shown by all.

Carnival is putting its foot down indeed and it comes after some highly reported altercations on ships in recent weeks. In June and July separate incidents occurred aboard Carnival Magic from New York and Carnival Elation from Jacksonville Florida. Such incidents however are not confined to Carnival Cruise Line. Royal Caribbean Navigator of the Seas had a similar incident in early July.

Royal Caribbean Moves Forward With Starlink

Royal Caribbean Group is the first cruise company worldwide that will fully implement the SpaceX Starlink Maritime high-speed internet onboard cruise ships.

Starting immediately the company will start installation onboard cruise ships sailing for Royal Caribbean International Celebrity Cruises and Silversea.

Royal Caribbean has been extensively testing the system onboard Freedom of the Seas over the last weeks insights the company is taking onboard for the rest of the fleet.

Celebrity Cruises has already provided an update on when it plans to implement the new systems on its ships. Celebrity’s newest ship Celebrity Beyond will receive the new system on September 5.

All of the Celebrity Edge Series ships will have been updated by the end of this year. The installation will then continue into 2023 and be complete by May.

According to Royal Caribbean the feedback from guests has been extremely positive and by the end of the first quarter of 2023 the cruise line hopes to have the rollout complete for the entire fleet.

In 2023 Virgin Voyages will launch its official loyalty program. Ahead of the launch the Richard Branson-owned cruise line has released details on several perks available to guests this year. These perks and previous onboard purchases will help guests propel themselves to elite status in 2023.

Virgin Voyages will offer two different perks in the coming months aimed at helping guests achieve a higher status once the official loyalty program launches next year.

The first one ‘Deep Blue Extras’ will give guests that book a massive amount of extras once they set foot onboard elevating them to VIPs.

The second perk is the Red Hot Booking Bonus Months. Running between August 30 and November 15 2022 any booking made in this period will qualify guests for special onboard spending perks and chances to win extraordinary experiences across the Virgin family.

As a thank you to trailblazing guests who were the first to sail onboard Scarlet Lady and Valiant Lady the cruise line is also introducing Tokens. These Tokens track all qualifying spending onboard to ensure Sailors are positioned for benefits in 2023.

Those who sailed in 2021 with Virgin are called Sea-Blazers. Amongst other perks they will receive a $125 Bar Tab Bonus for life. Anyone who has sailed with Virgin Voyages twice in 2022 is a Sea-Rover. They will earn a $100 Bar Tab Bonus for two years.

Norwegian Cruise Line Switches to Coca-Cola

Following earlier reports and sightings of drink offerings onboard various ships Norwegian Cruise Line has officially announced the switch from PepsiCo soft drinks to Coca-Cola products.

This change is in conjunction with the inaugural sailing of the cruise line’s newest vessel Norwegian Prima which is already serving Coca-Cola beverages.

The new Norwegian Prima is the first vessel in Norwegian’s 18-ship fleet to carry Coca-Cola as its official soft drink. The remaining NCL ships will all be fully switched over to Coca-Cola products by December 2022.

Guests onboard different vessels have already reported the expanding availability of Coca-Cola drinks including on Norwegian Breakaway Norwegian Epic and Norwegian Joy.

Additional ships will begin offering Coca-Cola beverages as bars and lounges can be adequately supplied but there has been no calendar announced of which ships will have which drinks when.

It can be a challenge to make the switch even on a single ship since each vessel has many different bars lounges and restaurants that all need to be equipped with adequate supplies and new branding to promote the new partnership.

As protocols for different cruise itineraries embarkation ports and destinations have been shifting rapidly in the past few weeks guests booked on the upcoming transatlantic crossings from Europe to North America will be relieved to finally have updated guidance for their cruise travel.

According to the updated protocols all guests ages 5 and older are required to be fully vaccinated prior to embarkation. The final dose of the primary vaccine series must be administered at least 14 days before sailing.

All guests for these sailings must submit a negative result from a pre-cruise test. Guests who are fully vaccinated and up-to-date on their vaccination including the booster shot when their primary vaccine series was completed more than 9 months before sailing may take a supervised PCR or antigen test up to three days before boarding.

Unvaccinated guests do not need to take two tests but must be sure their tests are administered within the appropriate time frame prior to embarkation to be valid.

No unsupervised self-test will be accepted for any pre-cruise testing regardless of vaccination status or the timing of the test.

Please enter a valid email address.

Two generations of boxing are coming face-to-face in Arlington Texas in just about two months and neither Mike Tyson nor Jake Paul Is hiding their age.

Tyson 57 and Paul 27 began their press tour for their much-anticipated fight on Monday at the legendary Apollo Theater in Harlem New York. And despite just being miles from where Tyson grew up the crowd seemed pretty split between the two.

The July 20 bout will mark Tyson’s first fight in over four years when he fought Roy Jones Jr. in an exhibition (Paul was on that undercard against Nate Robinson). It will be a sanctioned professional fight which Tyson hasn’t participated in since June 11 2005 against Kevin McBride.

Formerly known as the ""Baddest Man on the Planet"" Tyson has been posting clips of his training and make no mistake his power is still there.

But he’s no spring chicken.

Of course there are doubts whether at his age he can last the eight rounds each of which will be two minutes.

DEONTAY WILDER SCARED FOR MIKE TYSON'S WELL-BEING IN JAKE PAUL FIGHT: HE'S TOO OLD FOR THIS'

Once a man who exuded more confidence than anyone Tyson obviously knows that Father Time is undefeated and he was brutally honest about how he feels physically.

""My body is s--- right now"" he admitted on Monday. ""I’m really sore.""

That confidence Tyson once had Paul has it all if not more.

The YouTuber-turned-boxer has made the sport the most popular it has been since Tyson’s heyday. He’s done it in a much different way but it’s not hyperbole when one says this may be the biggest fight in modern history.

It’s almost ironic that Paul is going from boxers hardly anyone ever heard of in his last two fights (Andre August and Ryan Bourland each of whom were first-round knockouts) to arguably the best ever.

So when a fan asked Paul if he could ""take a hit"" from Tyson that confidence was on full display.

""They call him Iron Mike Tyson but I’m Titanium Jake Paul.""

Prior he said ""I'm going to show the world that I can outbox Mike Tyson prove everyone wrong and show that I will be the one doing the killing.""

Despite how his body feels though Tyson gave Paul a fair warning.

""Once he’s in that ring"" Tyson said ""he has to fight like his life depends on it because it will be.""

Paul is 9-1 in his career with his lone loss being via decision to Tommy Fury.

Tyson and Paul will now head to Dallas for one more press conference on Thursday the same day tickets go on sale.

Duke University/Instagram Jerry Seinfeld gives the commencement address at Duke University on May 12 2024

Jerry Seinfeld has some apologies to offer nearly two decades after the release of Bee Movie.

On Sunday May 12 the Seinfeld alum 70 gave a commencement address to the graduating seniors at Duke University in Durham North Carolina — where his son Julian currently attends and his daughter Sascha previously graduated from.

During his speech the comedian took time to reflect on his 2007 animated film Bee Movie — specifically one controversial element of the storyline.

""I made a cartoon movie about bees you may have watched as a child"" Seinfeld said in a video captured by an attendee and shared on TikTok.

""If any of you felt slightly uncomfortable about the sexual undertones in the relationship between Barry B. Benson and Vanessa the florist who saves his life I would like to apologize for that now"" he continued earning laughs from the crowd. ""I may not have calibrated that perfectly.""

Fans of the DreamWorks kids' movie have previously made long-running jokes about the romantic tension between Seinfeld's character in the film Barry (a bee) and Renée Zellweger's character Vanessa (a human). Back in October 2021 Seinfeld addressed the same issue during an appearance on The Tonight Show apologizing once again for the innuendo.

""I apologize for what seems to be a certain uncomfortable subtle sexual aspect of the Bee Movie"" he said at the time. ""[It] really was not intentional but after it came out I realized this is really not appropriate for children. Because the bee seems to have a thing for the girl and we don’t really want to pursue that as an idea in children’s entertainment.""

Seinfeld's commencement speech at Duke also drew public attention when anti-war protesters walked out of the ceremony and booed from the audience when the TV star took the podium according to NBC News and CBS News.

Seinfeld has been making a slew of public appearances in recent weeks in support of his newest movie Unfrosted which marks his feature-film directorial debut. Speaking with PEOPLE at the premiere of the movie on April 30 Seinfeld opened up about taking on the role of director for the first time in his career.

""You don't want to think about that this is a really big important job. Like the pilot never wants to come on the PA system and go 'I'm going to try and get this plane in the air.' You have to be confident"" he said.

Seinfeld previously told PEOPLE that he has ""been obsessed with Pop-Tarts my whole life"" which is what inspired him to take on the movie.

""My friend Spike Feresten who was a writer on my show and is still a good friend of mine thought we should make a movie out of the story the real story which we did"" he explained.



Unfrosted — which features a star-studded cast including Melissa McCarthy Jim Gaffigan Hugh Grant and more — is set in 1963 Battle Creek Mich. when ""Kellogg's and Post sworn cereal rivals race to create a pastry that will change the face of breakfast forever"" according to a synopsis.

The Series B round was led by Nyca Partners with commitments also coming from JPMorgan Chase Salesforce Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz according to a report from Forbes.

With the funds the company plans to further the develop its platform and expand its debt card service.

Propel offers a free mobile app that helps users manage benefits save money and earn income. It claims its platform is used by more than five million people across 50 states and three territories.

Other features include instant balance checking coupons to make savings access job postings and get instant updates about benefits.

Nyca Partners managing partner Hans Morris told Forbes â€œIf you look at financial services for poor people in many cases they’re a rip off.

â€œPropel shows that it doesn’t have to be like that but you have to be very good at avoiding people who are going to use the card fraudulently at managing all your costs but also at creating very good experiences. And it takes really good software to do that.â€

With the capital injection the company has raised a total of $80m in funding for its Series A.

Last year Nyca Partners led the $200m Series B funding round of Thought Machine a cloud-native core banking solution.

This is a huge amount of storage ideal for archiving games and storing media like music and video and well worth considering especially if your boot SSD is getting full. By comparison the cheapest 8TB SSD is £669 making this more than four times cheaper.

Seagate's IronWolf drives are generally reliable and as well as working fine as internal drives also do well as drives for NAS (network attached storage) servers. Modern PC cases continue to offer a surprising number of 3.5-inch bays so you should be able to find room for this drive and connect up the SATA power/data cables as necessary. One advantage of this over an M.2 SSD is that you can install way more SATA drives; most boards come with at least six SATA ports and some have eight or more.

If you'd prefer an 8TB in a more portable format you could install this into a USB enclosure or pick up a USB-SATA adapter; alternatively you could consider WD's Black D10 Game Drive which offers the same capacity in a form factor better suited to portable use. That costs just £165 thanks to another Amazon discount so it's not a bad alternative if you weren't planning on mounting a drive internally.

I hope you find this deal useful and stay tuned for one more tech deal to close out this week. See you soon!",,,,,,,,,,,,

TEEN MOM fans have expressed being divided over Chelsea Houska's new HGTV bio which labels the ex-MTV star as an ""actress"" and ""global inspiration.""

HGTV recently posted Chelsea's biography in preparation for the Teen Mom 2 alum's home renovation series Farmhouse Fabulous.

Set to premiere in the spring of 2023 each hour-long episode will feature Chelsea 31 and her husband Cole Deboer 34 assisting another family through the construction and ""design process.""

Per the Home and Garden Television network the former MTV star is described as an ""actress"" ""Instagram sensation"" and a ""global inspiration for women and young moms everywhere.""

Chelsea's show bio was reposted on a popular Teen Mom Reddit board where fans were quick to take exception to the labels afforded to the mother-of-four.

One fan commented: ""Actress? Global inspiration?! What the heck.""

A second person wrote: ""This is like when you fluff up your resume.""

""Such a strange type-up about them. It's the content I would expect Jenelle [Evans] to write about herself"" added a third.

Another commenter chimed: ""I didn't read on after they called her an actress because I knew it was all a lie.""

Chelsea's title of ""actress"" was a topic of constant confusion throughout the post's comment thread too.

One fan questioned ""Actress?"" while another laughingly stated ""Actress lmao...""

'GLOBAL INSPIRATION'

Other fans chose to focus on the reality star being described as a ""global inspiration"" as one Redditor questioned: ""Fan favorite and global inspiration... Did Cole write this?

""'Instagram sensation' is a bit much... she has a lot of followers because of the show"" added another fan.

One Redditor provided a possible explanation for the ""generous description"" writing: ""I can’t speak for HGTV or even TV in general but I do work in a similar industry. Usually blurbs like this are written by the individual.""

Another defended: ""It seems people here disagree but I'll check it out....""

""I actually dig Chelsea and her story I’m here for it...."" one added.

FREE FURNITURE

Chelsea's manager has admitted the TV personality received furniture decor and other home items for free while building her South Dakota farmhouse.

Chelsea and Cole bought land and built their South Dakota farmhouse as the family moved into the dream home in early 2021.

The U.S. Sun exclusively revealed that the couple received many free items during the building process including paint furniture decor and more.

The social media deals were mentioned in Chelsea and Cole’s $3million lawsuit.

The duo was sued by consulting company Envy for $3million for allegedly withholding money made from social media promotions.

The information was revealed in Chelsea and Cole's manager William Dzombak’s deposition taken on August 18 2022.

In the court papers obtained by The U.S. Sun William was asked: “So what materials did they receive as part of promotions branding licensing et cetera? Beyond just rugs the actual building materials that they received?”

William responded: “The only thing they would have received is [Sherwin-Williams] paint and railings.”

He added that Chelsea and Cole also received paint primer in exchange for “some sort of social media post” according to the manager.

He was then asked: “What was the arrangement between Down Home DeBoers and Montgomery's Interiors?”

William answered: “They probably provided some home furnishings. I'm not sure exactly what.”

William added that the couple also received bedding from company Beddy’s.

In addition to the sheets and comforter William “assumed” during the deposition that the couple also received “payment” for certain posts.

Chelsea and Cole’s Instagram Down Home Deboers promoted various items and companies to their over 700000 followers.

DREAM HOUSE

Chelsea and Cole bought a plot of land in Vermillion South Dakota and began building on it in early 2020.

They updated fans on the building and decor process.

The farmhouse has hardwood floors throughout.

The kitchen has white cabinets with a black island for contrast stainless steel appliances and granite countertops.

The living room has a black brick fireplace and ceiling-length windows while the home has modern farmhouse vibes throughout.

FARMHOUSE FABULOUS

As previously mentioned Chelsea and Cole snagged a new HGTV show called Farmhouse Fabulous after building the home.

The series which is set to debut in 2023 will follow the couple as they help families renovate their homes.

Chelsea and Cole have filmed for the series as they shared photos and videos of their renovations with fans.

It’s no secret that northern St. Johns County is experiencing a massive development boom right now.

Over the past decade thousands of single-family and multi-family living units have popped up throughout land that had long sat undeveloped near the county line between southern Duval and northern St. Johns. And with any significant growth in population commercial development soon follows.

Over half a dozen retail center projects have sprung up in the northern St. Johns area. The largest of these projects Durbin Park has been detailed frequently by local publications including our own. We even created a running list of future Durbin Park tenants which became one of our most-viewed articles of all time showing the clear interest in retail growth in the area.

That’s why we’ve decided to make a dedicated list for all of the other less-mentioned developments that are underway in the northern St. Johns area. We’ve listed what we know so far below and we’ll keep updating the list as new tenants and projects are announced.

Be sure to check back frequently for updates. And if you wish to utilize these lists on your own page please be sure to link back to our original list!

Joe looks at some fun sponsorships,"Joe Blundo

Special to The Columbus Dispatch

The hallowed ground on which the Buckeyes play is now known as “Safelite Field At Ohio Stadium.”

Fans who regard the Horseshoe as the football equivalent of St. Peter’s Basilica are asking where it will all end.

Well I’d say a long way from here.

As long as fans are willing to put up with anything (which ultimately they are) and TV continues to own college football (which assuredly it will) these sponsorship deals won’t stop. It’ll get a lot more intrusive than having a car-window company’s name on the field.

Here are my predictions:

Script Dorito

In exchange for millions of dollars Ohio State allows the marching band to spell out the name of a snack. But the university draws the line at “Cool Ranch Dorito” because it would mean expanding the band by 200 members and stretching the formation beyond the stadium. “We do have our standards” a university spokesman says.

'Charmin Ohio'

In one of its most controversial moves OSU sells the naming rights to ""Carmen Ohio"" the alma mater to a toilet paper company. The lyrics begin as always “Oh come let’s sing Ohio’s praise” but there’s a subtle change later in the song: “Summer’s heat or winter’s cold/You always gotta have a roll.”

Brutus Smuck-eye

J.M. Smucker the giant jelly company with headquarters in Ohio pays millions to meld its name with the Ohio State mascot. The agreement allows Brutus to retain his traditional look but calls for him to travel with a sidekick Toast who leaves a slick of strawberry jam as he cavorts on the field.

More:Who's the fairest Big Ten mascot of them all? Joe Blundo ponders the new additions

H&R Block O

The tax-preparation company antes up big bucks to put its name on the student cheering section which will now hold up cards labeled Form 1040.

Taco Victory Bell

What used to be known as simply the Victory Bell continues to toll after every Buckeye triumph — and also every time Taco Bell wants to alert the city to a two-for-one deal on chalupas.

Scarlet and Greyhound

In exchange for a few million dollars from the bus company the university agrees that every TV mention of the school colors will be accompanied by a honk and hissing airbrakes.

More:Blundo: How will the Jan. 6 insurrection be remembered years from now?

LegO-hio Stadium

Finally the inevitable arrives. After selling naming rights to everything from the yard markers to the urinals OSU auctions off the name of the stadium itself to a Danish toy company.

Fans long since conditioned to such deals are less irked by the name change than by the requirement that the stadium be repainted in tiny blocks of primary colors.

“But it could have been worse” shrugs one. “SpaghettiO-hio Stadium was also in the running. The turf would have been red and dotted with meatballs.”

ROBBIE Williams' wife Ayda Field has shared a saucy snap of her pop singer husband lying naked in bed to her Instagram fans.

The mother-of-four posted the snap of Robbie 48 to her following as she gushed over him being so hard-working.

Ayda 43 posted the snap of her hunky husband as he was seen sleeping with a black-out eye mask on his face.

Showing off his incredible collection of tattoos she covered his manhood with the duvet and a pillow as he slept.

""Rob had interviews all day yesterday. This was him TOTALLY asleep in bed this morning"" she captioned the snap.

""PS He’s up right now and has given me his full blessing to post this. Hard work pays off"" Ayda added.

It comes after Ayda showed off her black eye after a surgical procedure that left her “totally f***ing scared"" last month.

The star who shares four children with Robbie took to social media to tell fans she was “rockin’ a full shiner” with a sad face emoji.

In the snap Ayda looks at the camera with one eye noticeably different to the other while donning a grey t-shirt and her hair tied back.

The star has had to have a chalazion removed from her eye which is a small lump on the edge of the eyelid which happens when a gland is blocked at the base of an eyelash.

Ayda shared a picture in a green cap before going into surgery and admitted she was terrified but trying to play it cool before the removal.

After it was done she shared a snap in sunglasses and told fans she’d be “wearing them for a while” after the surgery that “sucked.”

According to WebMD a chalazion starts with a small area that may be red or swollen and you can treat it at home with a warm compress or by gently massaging the eyelid a few times a day.

If needed a procedure is normally performed under anaesthetic to numb the eyelid and the eyelid can remain inflamed for several weeks afterwards.

Ayda was in hospital a couple of months ago for a colonoscopy too and shared an update with fans on how she was getting on.

The X Factor judge shared a selfie of herself wearing a hospital gown facemask and disposable hair net.

Courteney Cox has treated fans to some stunning snaps of her sporting a string bikini as she enjoys an Italian getaway with her beau Johnny McDaid.

The Friends actress 58 looked like she was living her best life as she got behind the wheel of a boat on Italy's Amalfi Coast.

Grinning from ear-to-ear the mum of one showed off her slender frame as she larked around looking fresh faced without a scrap of slap.

She wore her raven locks in a long pony tail and sported a pair of pinked-hued glasses which set off her black swimwear a treat.

The actress then shared a loved-up pic of her and the Northern Irish singer with a beautiful moonlit backdrop - followed by a clip of her behind the wheel of a car.

Courteney captioned the post on Instagram : ""Learning to drive in Ireland and on the open seas. Not good at either but I ain’t worried ‘bout it….my instructor was hot.""

(Image: Instagram) (Image: Instagram)

Of course the Scream star's instructor is Snow Patrol singer Johnny 46 who's been dating the beauty for eight years.

With Courteney's acting career in the US and Johnny's home in the UK it's not always easy for the pair to get together.

But nothing could have prepared them for the global lockdown due to the coronavirus - which forced them apart for two years.

Johnny who is currently based in London now spends his time between the UK and the actress' home in LA.

But that wasn't previously possible as lockdown restrictions brought travel to a halt.

Describing their separation Johnny said: ""We were apart as many people were apart from their families and loved ones but we were able to stay as connected as we could and both of us dived into being creative.

""'She made her show and a new product line and I made Bad Habits with Ed [Sheeran] so we were able to stay really productive even if it was tough being apart - and it was tough but we don’t have the toughest lives in the world - we’re so lucky.""

Lucky or not the singer has admitted that despite being together for so many years Courteney still can't understand a word he says.

Speaking to MailOnline he said: ""My partner is American and she hasn't understood a word I've said for eight years.

""She hasn't got a clue!""

The young actor who plays Sam Blakeman in the ITV soap hasn't been seen on-screen as much as usual.

Jude 11 has had a busy summer after taking his SATs (Standard Assessment Tests) at school before heading off on a sunshine break in Greece with his family. But he has spent some time at the Salford-based set and during Friday night's trip to the cobbles viewers saw Sam undergoing a big change.

The son of Nick Tilsley and Natasha Blakeman who made his Weatherfield debut in 2020 was seen heading off for his first day a secondary school alongside friend and neighbour Hope Stape played by Isabella Flanagan.

Viewers watched as a proud Nick got a photo on the street with his son in his Weatherfield High uniform before Tyrone Dobbs offered him a lift to the school. Sam however seemed hesitant as he kept looking towards to postbox at the end of the road. Hope didn't take her eyes off him and he eventually caved and took up Tyrone's offer.

Later returning home Hope asked Sam to stay for tea but the youngster claimed he needed to go and see his dad who had been texting him to no avail. ""I think he thinks I'm dead"" he joked before heading off. He then took a letter out of his sachel and posted it into the red postbox outside Dev's corner shop.

But as he peered inside Hope caught him and later confronted him on what he was up to. He refused to give any details and when she threatened to tell Nick he told Hope that he'd tell Tyrone and her mum Fiz that she's speaking to someone online. They both agreed to stay quiet before Nick brought an end to their walkie-talkie exchange.

And Corrie fans have been taking to Twitter to speculate on who Sam could be trying to contact. @mishybabez_ tweeted: ""Who is sam sending a letter to? I think Harvey for some reason #Corrie."" But @hollycarruthers said: ""Aw is Sam sending his mam a letter #corrie"" despite her death in upsetting scenes last year. While @Kaclynn67 suggested: ""I wonder if Sam is in contact with someone from Natasha’s family and that is who he’s mailing a letter to. Maybe a sibling of Natasha’s is on there way to the cobbles #Corrie.""

Following the episode Jude took to Instagram to share a behind-the-scenes snap of himself in his character's school uniform alongside Isabella. ""Sam & Hope start Weatherfield High"" he captioned the photo of the pair posing for the camera.

And the comments soon came rolling in as fans were pleased to see Sam back on-screen. @anne_connors1101 said: ""Brilliant to see you back Jude."" @anneirajones echoed: ""Great to c u back on telly."" @laurieinqueens commented: ""Was so good to see you onscreen again!""

Hope you both enjoy ‘Wethy High’.""

Jude had addressed his absence from the soap last week. Jude's mum regularly helps keep the young star's Instagram followers informed of what the Corrie and Brassic actor is up to. ""I know you haven't seen Sam for ages but that's how it goes sometimes"" he explained

""Lots of q's asking when Sam is back. He has popped up a few times over last few weeks but is back again in September for his back to school and lots of other things."" He also shared a series of images from his recent trip to Rhodes with his mum dad and older brother. He said: ""2 days off then busy busy and the start of high school ahead."" He then added: ""THE BEER IS OBVIOUSLY MY DADS"" referring to a snap of him holding up a pint of the alcoholic beverage.

In the modern SAZ both biological and solubility pumps strongly control spatial distribution and seasonal variability of surface-water pCO 2 121329. Regarding the spatial distribution Fig. 1a shows small northward declines in annual mean surface-water pCO 2 within the SAZ where nutrient (nitrate) is progressively utilized equatorward (Fig. 1b). Enhanced nutrient consumption would lower surface-water pCO 2  but this biological effect is compensated by the opposing influence of equatorward surface-water warming in the SAZ (Fig. 1c). Consequently surface-water pCO 2 changes caused by nutrient consumption is largely balanced by decreasing CO 2 solubility and the total northward surface-water pCO 2 decline is marginal. Regarding the seasonal variability Fig. 1d shows minimal monthly surface-water pCO 2 deviation from the annual mean levels in the SAZ. By contrast seasonal changes in the biological and solubility pumps each cause surface-water pCO 2 to fluctuate ~40 ppm around the annual mean level (Fig. 1e f)1229. Because the strong (weak) biological pump occurs during warm (cold) seasons with low (high) CO 2 solubility effects from the biological and solubility pumps generally cancel each other leading to little seasonal surface-water pCO 2 variability. Combined these spatial and temporal patterns suggest that the solubility pump plays a critical role comparable to that of the biological pump in determining the SAZ surface-water pCO 2 fluctuations in the modern ocean. Next we move on to explore the impact of the solubility pump on past surface-water pCO 2 changes a topic that has rarely been studied by proxy reconstructions.

New deglacial SAZ surface-water pCO 2 and δ15N records

We present records of surface-water pCO 2 and nutrient utilization respectively based on boron isotopes (δ11B)223031 and foraminifera-bound nitrogen isotopes (δ15N FB ) of mixed-layer-dwelling planktic foraminifera species Globigerina bulloides for site MD97-2106 from the Southwest Pacific Ocean (Fig. 1). Site MD97-2106 (45.15°S 146.28°E) is located in the northern part of the SAZ. Compared to today the Subtropical Front the northern boundary of the SAZ possibly shifted northward to Tasmania during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; ~22-18 ka)3233. During the last deglaciation the Subtropical Front might migrate southwards3233 but unlikely to the south of our site. This is because the Subtropical Front marks a ~4 °C SST gradient34 while reconstructions at our site only show ~3 °C SST change during the entire deglaciation3536. Consequently our site was likely located within the SAZ during the entire last deglaciation ideal for investigating deglacial SAZ surface conditions. The age model of site MD97-2106 during the last deglaciation is based on new radiocarbon dates and tuning of SST at this site to Antarctic temperatures26 (Fig. 2a b; Supplementary Table 1 Supplementary Fig. 4). See Methods for analytical details.

Curves in d–g are derived from a LOESS smoother. In d light and dark envelopes respectively represent 2.3–97.7% (roughly ±2σ) and 15.9–84.1% (roughly ±1σ) uncertainty ranges of timeseries incorporating uncertainties from measurements all individual parameters used for calculations and age models. In f and g only 15.9–84.1% uncertainty ranges are shown for clarify. The vertical pale orange bars represent Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1; ~18.0–14.6 ka BP) and the Younger Dryas (YD; ~12.8–11.7 ka BP). The vertical pale blue bar represents the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR; ~14.6–12.8 ka BP). δpCO 2 SOL and δpCO 2 BIO (f) show similar structures to SST (a) and foraminifera-bound δ15N (g) respectively.

Our reconstructed surface-water pCO 2 at site MD97-2106 fluctuated between ~210 and ~270 ppm during the last deglaciation reached ~270 ppm at the onset of the Holocene and increased by ~20 ppm from the early to middle Holocene (Fig. 2d). The range of deglacial surface-water pCO 2 at site MD97-2106 is comparable to previous reconstructions2223. At our site surface-water pCO 2 briefly dropped below the atmospheric pCO 2 values during the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR; 14.6–12.8 ka BP) and the Younger Dryas (YD; 12.8–11.7 ka BP) (Fig. 2d).

In addition to our surface-water pCO 2 reconstructions we employ δ15N FB to infer nitrate utilization efficiency at site MD97-2106. δ15N FB reflects δ15N of surface-water nitrate taken up by foraminifera which increases as surface nitrate is progressively consumed by photosynthetic algae113738. During Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1; 18.0-14.6 ka BP) when the age model of our core is well constrained by a warming phase δ15N FB at our site remained roughly unchanged (Fig. 2b g). This observation is consistent with a precisely dated coral-bound δ15N record from the same region showing minimal δ15N variability over the same period21 (Supplementary Fig. 9). Maxima of δ15N FB occurred during the ACR and the YD coinciding with surface-water pCO 2 minima. During the Holocene δ15N FB declined by about 2.0‰ consistent with other fossil-bound δ15N records from the Southern Ocean1121394041.

Evaluating past biological and solubility effects at site MD97-2106

We partition surface-water pCO 2 changes at site MD97-2106 into two components caused by changes in biological and solubility pumps using a similar method previously applied to investigate modern surface-water pCO 2 variability121629. Firstly we calculate total in-situ surface-water pCO 2 changes (noted as δpCO 2 TOTAL) relative to the reference age of 18 ka; choosing a different reference age has little effect on our conclusions (Supplementary Fig. 6). Secondly surface-water pCO 2 is recalculated using carbonate chemistry (i.e. DIC and alkalinity) fixed at the reference age but using varying SST and sea surface salinity (SSS) based on our reconstructions (Methods). Thirdly this recalculated surface-water pCO 2 is used to compute changes relative to 18 ka (the reference age). The relative surface-water pCO 2 changes calculated in this way are only driven by SST and SSS and thus are attributed to the solubility pump effect (noted as δpCO 2 SOL). Fourthly we calculate the difference between δpCO 2 TOTAL and δpCO 2 SOL which is defined as the biology-driven surface-water pCO 2 change (noted as δpCO 2 BIO). We also provide an alternative approach to directly calculate δpCO 2 BIO which yields consistent results with those presented in the main text (Methods; Supplementary Fig. 8). Any influence of external processes on surface-water pCO 2  such as changes associated with frontal shift is embedded in our method because these external processes affect surface-water pCO 2 via the carbonate chemistry SST-SSS or both. See “Methods” for calculation details.

As can be seen from Fig. 2f δpCO 2 BIO at site MD97-2106 fluctuated between ~−20 ppm and ~+40 ppm from the LGM to the early Holocene followed by a ~20-ppm increase during the Holocene. From 18 to 15 ka δpCO 2 BIO showed little net change suggesting marginal influence of biological processes on surface-water pCO 2 variations at our site. During the ACR and the YD δpCO 2 BIO exhibits mostly negative values indicating a strengthened biological pump that would lower surface-water pCO 2 during these times. The evolution of δpCO 2 BIO at our site is well corroborated by our δ15N FB record from the same core. Little net δpCO 2 BIO change concurred with stable δ15N FB during HS1 while negative δpCO 2 BIO during the ACR and the YD coincided with higher δ15N FB values which indicate more complete nutrient utilization (Fig. 2f–g). We note that in addition to nitrate utilization in the SAZ our δ15N FB might have also been affected by δ15N of nitrate supplied to our site which depends on the nitrate utilization of the nitrate source11214142. Despite these complications similar deglacial structures in δ15N FB and independently derived δpCO 2 BIO suggest that δ15N FB at site MD97-2106 reflects local nitrate utilization efficiency. Moreover given their independent methods consistent patterns of our δpCO 2 BIO and δ15N FB lend strong support to our inference about past biological pump changes at this site. In stark contrast to previous findings in the SAZ222324 our δpCO 2 BIO and δ15N FB suggest that the biological pump played a minor role in contributing to surface-water pCO 2 and thus air-sea CO 2 exchange at site MD97-2106 during HS1 and the YD when atmospheric pCO 2 rose substantially4344.

Compared with δpCO 2 BIO our calculated δpCO 2 SOL which reflects solubility pump effects shows a different history (Fig. 2f). As expected deglacial δpCO 2 SOL increased in response to warming although this warming effect was slightly counteracted by a declining SSS (Supplementary Fig. 5). From 18 to 10 ka δpCO 2 SOL showed a net increase of ~20 ppm contributing to about one-third of the δpCO 2 TOTAL at site MD97-2106 over the same period. More specifically the δpCO 2 SOL increase dominated the δpCO 2 TOTAL rise from 18 to 15 ka in contrast to little net change in the concurrent δpCO 2 BIO. This highlights the critical role of the weakened solubility pump in maintaining positive sea-air pCO 2 gradients which would contribute to the atmospheric pCO 2 rise during HS1. During the YD rising δpCO 2 SOL helped reverse biological effects (shown by δpCO 2 BIO and δ15N FB ) to limit the development of negative sea-air pCO 2 gradient (Fig. 2f-g) contributing to the contemporary atmospheric pCO 2 rise.

By separating influences of the biological and solubility pumps downcore we demonstrate that a substantial portion of deglacial surface-water pCO 2 rise at our site originated from variations in the solubility pump. This suggests that the solubility pump which has been neglected in previous investigations in the region played an important role in regulating deglacial surface-water pCO 2 changes in the Pacific SAZ.

Proxy and model data evaluation for broader SAZ

To quantify past influences of biological and solubility pumps in broader SAZ regions we reanalyze deglacial surface-water pCO 2 changes at three additional locations using published proxy records2223 (Figs. 1a; 3b–d). At all the investigated sites our calculated δpCO 2 BIO suggests little-to-modest biological pump effects on SAZ surface-water pCO 2 during times with large atmospheric pCO 2 rises. For instance except for a brief excursion at ~17 ka δpCO 2 BIO at Site ODP 1090 (Fig. 3b) varied little and suggests minimal biological pump effects on surface-water pCO 2 during the last deglaciation23. At site PS2498-1 despite an overall larger δpCO 2 BIO contribution to surface-water pCO 2 compared to other sites roughly stable average δpCO 2 BIO during ~14-11 ka contributed little to the observed surface-water pCO 2 rise (Fig. 3c). At site TAN1106-28 δpCO 2 BIO showed a prominent peak at ~16 ka but the general deglacial trend of δpCO 2 BIO is poorly defined by the low temporal resolution. In contrast to δpCO 2 BIO changes our calculated δpCO 2 SOL at all studied sites supports that solubility pump changes consistently contributed to deglacial δpCO 2 TOTAL. From 18 to 10 ka we observe well-defined δpCO 2 SOL increases of ~20 ppm at Site ODP 1090 from the South Atlantic. At site TAN1106-28 from the South Pacific δpCO 2 SOL increased by ~50 ppm in response to the deglacial SST change of ~7 °C in part caused by a possible frontal shift over this site23. Although the record at site PS2498-1 does not cover the entire last deglaciation δpCO 2 SOL at this site shows a ~30-ppm increase during ~14–11 ka (Fig. 3c). These δpCO 2 SOL changes significantly contribute to or even dominate the surface-water pCO 2 variations at these sites strengthening our findings at site MD97-2106. Overall our analyses of proxy data from different sectors of the Southern Ocean demonstrate that deglacial surface-water pCO 2 changes in the SAZ are substantially affected by solubility pump changes rather than solely by biological pump changes as previously assumed112223.

Data in the four panels are arranged as follows.

Envelopes represent 15.9–84.1% uncertainties incorporating uncertainties from measurements all individual parameters required for calculations and age models. The vertical pale orange bars represent Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1; ~18.0–14.6 ka BP) and the Younger Dryas (YD; ~12.8–11.7 ka BP). The vertical pale blue bar represents the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR; ~14.6–12.8 ka BP). The reference age for relative surface-water pCO 2 change decomposition at these sites is set at 18 ka except at site PS2498-1 where it is set at the oldest age of ~15.8 ka. For all sites examined solubility pump changes consistently contribute ~20–50 ppm to the deglacial surface-water pCO 2 changes (second row). Surface-water pCO 2 changes attributed to the biological pump (third row) differ from dust and export production (fourth row). Full size image

We further scrutinize the role of the solubility pump in affecting deglacial SAZ surface-water pCO 2 in a simulation by climate model LOVECLIM28. In this simulation a 30-ppm atmospheric pCO 2 increase is achieved during HS1 when the Southern Ocean overturning circulation and southern hemisphere westerly winds are intensified. The rising surface-water pCO 2 in the Southern Ocean is diagnosed as a main CO 2 source for the early deglacial atmospheric pCO 2 increase28. Using the same method applied to proxy data we quantify δpCO 2 BIO and δpCO 2 SOL changes between 19 ka and 15 ka in this simulation (“Methods”). Our decomposition (Fig. 4) reveals that δpCO 2 BIO changes are either small or tend to lower pCO 2 TOTAL in the SAZ. Because nutrient utilization forced by iron availability is not prescribed in the model our calculated δpCO 2 BIO per se cannot be used to dismiss iron fertilization effect on deglacial SAZ surface-water pCO 2 changes. By contrast δpCO 2 SOL changed substantially due to strong surface warming dominating surface-water δpCO 2 TOTAL rise in the SAZ (Fig. 4). Therefore our model data analyses suggest that solubility pump changes are crucial for deglacial surface-water pCO 2 and air-sea CO 2 exchange in the SAZ strengthening our findings based on above extensive proxy reconstructions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9jaGluYS1iaWctdGhyZWUtYWlybGluZXMtb3JpZ2luLXN0b3J5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How China's 'Big Three' Airlines Came To Be,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9jaGluYS1iaWctdGhyZWUtYWlybGluZXMtb3JpZ2luLXN0b3J5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnN0YWdyYW0tcmVtb3Zlcy1wb3JuaHViLWFjY291bnQtMTg1MjEyNjYwLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Instagram Removes Pornhub's Account,"Instagram has suspended Pornhub’s widely followed account on the social platform.

Before the sex site’s account was removed from Instagram Pornhub had 13.1 million followers and more than 6200 posts. Reps for Meta Instagram’s parent company did not respond to a request for comment.

The move comes one month after Visa and Mastercard cut off payment privileges of TrafficJunky the advertising arm of Pornhub parent company MindGeek. That followed a federal court ruling in July rejecting Visa’s request to be removed from a case in which MindGeek is being sued for allegedly distributing child pornography and that alleges Visa knowingly facilitated MindGeek’s ability to monetize the illegal content.

On its Instagram account Pornhub shared nonpornographic videos and images. However it had “directly promoted pornography” and featured videos like “Next Career Goal” encouraging people to become pornography performers according to Dawn Hawkins CEO of the National Center on Sexual Exploitation. The NCOSE had been among a group of advocates that has lobbied Instagram to remove Pornhub.

“Instagram is courageously choosing to stop partnering with Pornhub and it is time for all corporate entities to follow its example” Hawkins said.

Pornhub’s Twitter account (3.4 million followers) remains active as does its official YouTube channel (882000 subscribers) where it shares “safe-for-work” video content.

In June MindGeek CEO Feras Antoon and COO David Tassillo resigned. The Montreal Quebec-based company also laid off an unknown number of employees.

The plaintiff in the case against MindGeek that names Visa as a defendent is Serena Fleites who when she was 13 said she was pressured by her then-boyfriend into making a sexually explicit video — which he allegedly uploaded to Pornhub without her knowledge or consent. Fleites is one of more than two dozen individual plaintiffs who last year sued Pornhub and MindGeek alleging exploitation and monetization of child pornography rape videos trafficked content and stolen content.

In a previous statement MindGeek said it has “zero tolerance for the posting of illegal content on its platforms and has instituted the most comprehensive safeguards in user-generated platform history… Any insinuation that MindGeek does not take the elimination of illegal material seriously is categorically false.”

The company says it has banned uploads from anyone who has not submitted government-issued ID that passes third-party verification eliminated the ability to download free content integrated several content moderation tools and instituted digital fingerprinting of all videos found to be in violation of its policies forbidding non-consensual content and child sexual abuse material (CSAM) to help prevent removed videos being reposted. MindGeek also says it has expanded its moderation workforce and processes and partnered with dozens of nonprofit organizations around the world.

As an adult now I see how global geopolitics comes to play even in pop-culture. In every story there has to be a hero a savior of humanity and the villain has to be someone who threatens these global ideals of democracy peace and order. It’s even worse if the villain is trying to usurp the hero by almost landing the first man on the moon or having access to even more nuclear weapons.



This past week the last leader of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev died. As an African the USSR’s legacy on the continent and the fall of the Soviet Union is complicated as it brought both advantages and disadvantages. The steps Gorbachev took in dismantling the Soviet Union laid seeds for independence in certain parts of southern Africa including eventually leading to the end of apartheid in South Africa.



Since the fall of the Soviet Union new narratives have emerged in Hollywood and elsewhere. One superpower is pitted against the other with Africans expected to pick good from evil. But expecting a clear cut division between good and evil is a fallacy and a failure to understand history and the intricacies at play in every village town country and region. One person’s hero is another’s villain—Gorbachev too was more revered abroad than at home.



Your hero might be behind the assassination of DRC’s Patrice Lumumba one of Africa’s greatest post-colonial heroes. Your hero might have destabilized Mali laying the seeds for insurgency in the Sahel. Your heroes might have illegally over-fished with giant ships leading to the rise of piracy in the horn of Africa.

African governments’ apparent hesitancy to pick sides on certain geopolitical issues is all the proof needed that things are not always so black and white. Sometimes it’s complicated. This pseudo-neutrality should be seen as a sign of wisdom from those who know that yesterday’s foes might be tomorrow’s friends. —Ciku Kimeria Africa editor

How large is the market for financial services in Africa in dollar terms?



It is one of the most asked questions when investors assess an African fintech startup’s potential. In 2020 the figure was around $150 billion fueled by insurance retail and SME lending.



Contrary to popular opinion African fintech is not saturated. While fintech startups get the lions’ share of all investor funding into Africa companies in the sector have only scratched the surface with respect to closing the 90% dominance of cash in transactions Alexander Onukwue explains based on a new McKinsey report.

Tomilola Majekodunmi started Bankly in 2019 convinced that providing digital identities to over 60 million Nigerians was the surest route to decrease poverty in a sustainable way.



Think of Bankly as a digital technology service for suburban thrift savings setups where unbanked users trust an agent who visits at certain periods (sometimes weekly) to record deposits in a paper register.



After raising $2 million from institutional investors in 2021 the company wants to scale up from 15000 to 50000 agents and increase its capacity to serve the digitization needs of small businesses. Bankly is one of many agent-based fintech companies in Nigeria but Majekodunmi’s focus on thrift savings—a method typically used by women—attempts to solve a problem of exclusion that affects a significant portion of Nigeria’s population.

Immortality: The cost of living forever

This is a short excerpt from Quartz’s latest Obsession email written by our very own Faustine Ngila.



Advertisement

Have you ever desired to live forever? Or maybe just 200 more years?



The concept of immortality has been around as long as people have been alive. Without getting too philosophical there is some debate on what immortality actually means. Some believe eternal existence means that our conscious brains live on past the deterioration of our bodies. Others think it’s about postponing the aging process all together.



Technically if the universe ends like scientists think it will no one will ever be immortal. But that’s not stopping companies from going all in with anti-aging products and technologies that can keep us alive for much much longer. Read the full email here.

LUV,Southwest Airlines,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFuZGxlaXN1cmUuY29tL2FpcmxpbmVzLWFpcnBvcnRzL3NvdXRod2VzdC9zb3V0aHdlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtYmFnZ2FnZS1mZWVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Everything You Need to Know About Southwest Airlines Baggage Fees,"We appreciate it when travel companies are upfront about costs. Unforeseen expenses can throw off your budget causing a big downer when you're trying to enjoy your vacation.

Luckily Southwest lets bags fly for free as long as you follow its basic guidelines which include the number of bags the bag's weight and the luggage size limit. Make sure you're also up on the airline's policy regarding check-in times when flying with checked bags for both domestic and international travel. And know where the airline stands on lost or damaged items.

Free Carry-Ons and Checked Baggage

As the only U.S. domestic carrier that allows two free checked bags per paying passenger Southwest keeps things simple by avoiding nickel-and-diming customers.

Your Southwest ticket includes one carry-on bag one personal item (a small backpack laptop or camera case) and two checked bags for free. That's right! Thanks to the airline's revered ""Bags Fly Free"" program passengers don't have to deal with the nuisance of additional baggage fees as costs have already been factored into the ticket. Of course as with any airline there are size and weight guidelines but luggage that would sometimes otherwise be considered oversized—skis golf bags and surfboards—are free (surfboards on Hawaii flights only) on Southwest.

Excess Baggage Fees

Compared to most other U.S. airlines Southwest's baggage policy is streamlined. That means you only have to pull out your credit card once you go beyond the bag limit. For example a third checked bag will set you back $75 one way as long as it falls within the weight and size limit. Additionally all bags over 50 pounds or over 62 inches in size (length plus width plus height) will also run you $75 one way.

If you're checking an additional piece of luggage and it blows the weight or size limit then well that's going to cost you double. Per the airline's policy a $75 excess baggage fee combined with a $75 overweight fee adds up to $150 one way.

To reduce costs plan on keeping all luggage under 50 pounds especially if you're checking more than two bags. Additionally any item weighing more than 100 pounds and exceeding 80 inches in size must be shipped as Air Cargo.

The good news is that these fees (or lack of fees) apply to all passengers with no special exceptions. Because Southwest only flies Boeing 737 planes using an all-coach configuration the fees don't vary based on where you sit.

Military Personnel Are Exempt

Southwest does offer extra perks if you're an active-duty military passenger with a valid ID. In this case they waive the two-piece baggage limit as well as the oversize or overweight baggage rules. Just make sure your luggage doesn't exceed 100 pounds or 80 inches.

Checked Bags and Check-In Times

Make sure to arrive at check-in early should you plan on checking bags. Bags checked within 45 minutes of departure for domestic flights may not make it onto your plane. And if your bag doesn't arrive at your destination you're out of luck as Southwest will not pay delivery fees to get it to you.

For international travel the rules are stricter. Passengers with checked baggage are expected to check in 60 minutes prior to departure (and 75 minutes ahead of time if you're traveling from the U.S. to Aruba). If you miss this timeframe you will not be allowed to board at all.

Lost or Damaged Bags

The airline assumes no liability for loss or damage due to normal wear and tear which includes cuts scratches and scuffs. They also claim no responsibility for money jewelry electronic equipment photographic or video equipment irreplaceable items perishables foods and much more. So be careful what you pack in your checked baggage.

Any loss or damage to protruding parts of your luggage including wheels feet straps and pockets that is not due to normal wear and tear (as determined by a Southwest employee) is the responsibility of the airline. And compensation for the loss damage or delay of any baggage is limited to the proven amount of damage or loss and cannot exceed $3800.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt4eHYuY29tL25ld3MvdGV4YXMtZmxpZ2h0LWRlbGF5ZWQtYWZ0ZXItcGFzc2VuZ2VyLXNlbmRzLW51ZGVzLXRvLWVudGlyZS1wbGFuZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas flight delayed after passenger sends nudes to entire plane,"(CNN NEWSOURCE) — In Texas a flight was delayed after a passenger airdropped nude photos to the entire plane.

It happened on a southwest flight from Houston to Cabo San Lucas Mexico.

Whether it was a sick prank or something else nobody on board was amused with the airdrop.

Imagine sitting in your seat with your eyes closed - waiting for your flight from hobby airport to take off.

In two hours you'll be on a beach in Mexico.

But your daydream is rudely interrupted by a notification.

Someone has just sent you an airdrop.

Should you accept it or decline it?

Ok accept.

Bad decision.

You've just allowed a fellow passenger to send you a nude photo.

Now you wonder which one of the passengers it could be.

But you weren't the only one to get the pic.

""So here's the deal: if this continues while we're on the ground I'm going to have to pull back to the gate"" the pilot said.

""Everybody's gonna have to get off we're gonna have to get security involved and vacation is gonna be ruined""

""So you folks whatever that 'AirDrop' thing is quit sending naked pictures and let's get yourselves to Cabo.""

Yes this really did happen.

And no he didn't have to turn around the plane.

That passenger did give his ""Airdrop thing"" a rest for the remainder of the flight.

Southwest Airlines has since released the following statement:

""The safety security and well-being of customers and employees is the southwest team's highest priority at all times

""When made aware of a potential problem our employees address issues to support the comfort of those traveling with us.""

Luckily for that passenger - whether an accident or on purpose the situation was handled on the plane.

No law enforcement was dispatched upon landing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL3NvdXRod2VzdC1kaWRudC10ZWxsLWZhbWlseS11bmFjY29tcGFuaWVkLTEwNTE0Njk4Mi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest didn't tell the family of an unaccompanied 8-year-old that her flight was diverted,"A Southwest plane. Jonathan Weiss/Shutterstock

Southwest diverted a flight with an unaccompanied eight-year-old but didn't tell her family.

Ara Zoser said her niece was ""scared and hungry"" when she finally managed to get her on the phone.

The airline offered a $150 voucher but Zoser said it didn't take responsibility for the diversion.

Southwest diverted a flight that had an unaccompanied minor aged eight on board – but failed to let her family know.

On August 22 Ara Zoser's niece boarded a direct flight from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta bound for LaGuardia New York. The flight was due to land at 5:40 p.m.

An hour after that time her mother Regine called Zoser in a panic after the flight had been diverted to Baltimore-Washington airport in Maryland.

She told Insider that Regine received no notice of this flight change and another family member had been waiting for the child's arrival at the airport. ""Regine could not get in contact with Southwest as they were receiving an unusually high call volume causing long than normal wait times.""

Video: How flying scenes are shot for TV and movies

""I then called Southwest as well as tweeting them while I was on hold. There was still no word of my niece's status of wellbeing nor any reason why the flight was diverted"" Zoser said.

Zoser waited and after about an hour she was able to get in touch with a ""very helpful customer service representative."" Zoser waited on the line until the child came on the phone.

""My niece was scared and hungry in an unfamiliar place with no reasoning. She is only eight years old"" Zoser said.

There were four other unaccompanied minors on the flight along with her. They were given food vouchers at some point but Zoser said her niece did not reach LaGuardia until well after midnight.

Southwest offered a $150 flight voucher to Zoser's sister but ""refused to take responsibility for not contacting Regine about the whereabouts of her only child and not be forthcoming with information as her mother had to venture through many loopholes to finally speak to her daughter"" she said.

Southwest did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

Restaurant employees called police but the they were unable to find her until TSA screeners reported a “female matching that description was observed sleeping near the security checkpoint hindering their operations.” She left the checkpoint before police arrived there too but she was then identified at a baggage carousel.

Officers say she became “belligerent” according to the police report and threated to “spit on all” of the officers.” The 28-year-old woman though says she was just being harassed by police because they’d “never seen anyone as pretty as her” and that they’re “perverts and were trying to rape her” because of how good looking she is.

Ms. Bustami was arrested. She already had an outstanding warrant but bail was set at $1000. Apparently she wasn’t good looking enough to avoid multiple arrests."

(KY3) - Workers at the Starbucks on South Glenstone in Springfield recently voted to unionize making them part of the Chicago and Midwest Regional Joint Board Workers United union.

The store is the first location in southwest Missouri to do so. Workers say it is an idea that was sparked coming out of the pandemic.

“We want the best for each other and I feel like we’re gonna make that change whether they like it or not” said Johnie Tindle a Starbucks employee. ”Starbucks started taking away a lot of benefits that they gave us during the pandemic.”

Johnie Tindle and Sarah Sproull led the movement to unionize.

”We all were pretty much all struggling to make basic ends meet choosing between rent and food that month and knowing full well that Starbucks could do better for us” said Tindle.

In June they first filed for unionization to join the Workers United Union and recently won by a tally of 11-5.

The National Labor Relations Board says it received 18 eligible ballots and Starbucks attorneys challenged two.

”The main thing is that we’ll have the protections of the group and the majority going forward” said Sarah Sproull. Starbucks worker. “Starbucks’s have been really notorious recently and some lawsuits have recently come up against Howard Schultz our CEO because of the backlash that they’ve been giving to soldiers that are trying to unionize.”

Within the last week Starbucks has informed workers at two unionized stores one in Seattle and the other in Kansas City Missouri that the locations will be closing.

”Now that we have the power of a union behind us we’ve got Starbucks workers united holding our back so if they try something like that we have lawyers” said Sproull.

We reached out to Starbucks corporate about the Springfield Starbucks unionizing and they answered back with this statement “As we’ve said throughout we will respect the NLRB’s process and bargain in good faith with the stores that chose to be represented by Workers United. We hope the union does the same.”

The workers at 631 Glenstone say they remain hopeful because of the store’s new district manager and upgrades.

The Starbucks unionizing drive is a bright spot for a labor movement that has been in a steep decline since the 1950s battered by anti-labor corporations crippling labor laws and lack of organizing zeal by labor unions themselves. California is a center of the new effort with 16 stores throughout the state voting for union representation.

Tyler Keeling was one of those leading the successful effort at a Starbucks store in Lakewood. Like most of the other Starbucks organizers he is young — 26 — idealistic and determined to fight a corporation that has branded itself as progressive and open-minded. The reality is that these young union advocates have faced strident opposition from Starbucks executives and attempts to intimidate pro-union employees.

Recently workers at Keeling’s store even went on an unfair labor practice strike for a day over allegations that Starbucks is withholding new benefits from unionized stores that were announced by the company on May 3. Even though the first Starbucks store voted to unionize on Dec. 9 2021 there is still not one union contract that has been negotiated.

Keeling who will speak Monday at the Los Angeles/Long Beach Harbor Labor Coalition Labor Day Parade spoke to Capital & Main from his home in Long Beach about his life and what the workers at Starbucks want to achieve.

This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.

Capital & Main: You’re going to be sitting across the negotiating table from a Starbucks lawyer making $1000 an hour. Does that make you nervous?

Tyler Keeling: I don’t have a reason to be. The worst thing that can happen to me has already happened.

I don’t have a stable income so I don’t have too much to lose right? I’m not afraid of these people who have this rich education. I’ve got nothing to lose but I’ve got everything to gain. A fancy education doesn’t mean anything where I come from. People from the high desert like me who survived everything we’ve survived don’t have a reason to be scared of a lawyer from a huge corporation.

We have workers from different backgrounds and from different places like Compton who know what it’s like to come from an underserved community. We have LGBT co-workers who know what it is like to have little or no economic upward mobility. We are entry level workers but what we do is skilled labor. But we’re not getting compensated for skilled labor. We are scraping the bottom of the barrel so we have everything to gain.



“We work hard to make profits for Starbucks and they make so much money that they spend on everything but investing in us.”



So this first contract will be critical because Starbucks will want to give as little as possible to show other nonunion stores that unionization is not worth the trouble. And you need to get something significant to show workers at those other stores what is possible with a union.

That is definitely correct. First off having a good contract is necessary for us to make enough money to provide for what we need: our rent and food and so on. But also a contract is going to be a signal for other stores to look at where they can see why unionizing is important. We deserve a good contract because we work hard to make profits for Starbucks and they make so much money that they spend on everything but investing in us.

So it’s crucial for Starbucks to stop you from obtaining anything significant through negotiations.

They definitely are trying but they are not going to succeed. I currently make $18 an hour which ends up being about $1300 a month. I barely survive. My share of the rent is close to $1200 a month not including utilities or groceries or insurance for my car. I am using what savings I have left and using credit cards when I have to. It’s not feasible when you think that what I make is just over minimum wage. Many of my fellow workers are in the same situation.

Our store makes $60000 a week sometimes. Our manager often posts the store metrics in the back office for everyone to see in order to inspire us to do better. But it also made everyone aware of what the company was making. It’s a do or die situation for us. We don’t have another choice. That’s a big part of why I organize because I don’t want anyone else to have to live like that either — living paycheck to paycheck.

When did you start organizing your store?

I had my first conversation about unionization the day after the Starbucks in Buffalo New York won their election in early December. I started going around to everybody that I worked with and talked to everyone. I told them why unions were good and what they could do for workers. Sometimes I talked to people for hours. The other workers wanted to talk about it and wondered what was going to happen if they unionized. A lot of people knew they could trust me and I would be honest and real with them. There was fear at first but even if they were scared they knew they could trust me and I wouldn’t let them down. We would talk at their house outside the store on breaks and on the phone through Facetime.

I had no other connections across the country at this time. The first person I did meet from outside of California was Nikki Taylor from a Memphis Tennessee store one of the “Memphis Seven” who were all fired for organizing in February. They are legendary. Their firing made headlines everywhere. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has had them reinstated to the jobs as of a week or two ago. Nikki and I became friends and we talked a lot about organizing.

Then I met others from the Los Angeles area who were also organizing. We worked closely with Josie Serrano from the Long Beach store at Seventh and Redondo and we started doing things together and coordinating our activities. We learned how to be community organizers together. We started organizing our stores side by side since February. We really started moving things forward in early February of this year and we filed our petition for an election on March 7. Our vote was on May 13 and that’s when we won 24 to 1.

What were the primary issues for you and your co-workers?

The kinds of things that drove us to organize were wages inconsistent scheduling lack of accountability and transparency from management in the workplace and no true workplace protections from being unfairly fired or for being unfairly harassed. There were many reasons. We’re sitting here with historic inflation and we have been suffering and watching everything get more expensive. It was becoming harder to live. It was time to do something about that for ourselves.

Did you have experience with unions before this?

Not really? I knew a little bit and some key points of labor history. It is something I’ve become much more interested in. I’ve started to read and study more about it. When I was 15 or 16 I started reading about topics of social justice especially about marginalized people fighting for equal rights immigrant rights gay rights. With that came the history of what workers had done and the struggles they had. All of these fights became a single entity to me. I read reports that were posted online and I talked to a lot of people who knew more than I did. It was a community effort where everybody was talking about these fights for justice together in whatever space that was available — maybe the internet maybe at a party. It became a form of community teaching. It’s bigger than self-taught. It’s other people teaching me and me teaching other people. It’s holding each other accountable to learn as much as we can and to share what we know.

Did you go to college?

After I graduated high school I lived on a friend’s couch in El Monte. I worked at an assisted living care job in Whittier but the hours were inconsistent. I made about $200 every two weeks. It was bad. I went to Citrus College in Azusa for a year but then moved to Olympia Washington and started working at Starbucks there for $13 an hour as a barista in 2016.

In June of 2017 I moved again to New Jersey and worked at another Starbucks but took a pay cut to $10 an hour. I was promoted to supervisor but still only making $12 an hour. Moving from place to place I had no stability whatsoever. I moved back to California in 2018 and started working at a Starbucks in Glendora and moved to the Lakewood store in 2019.



“When I say I come from nothing I mean that. There was no economic opportunity in Apple Valley. It’s an economically abandoned area.”



But it was something about labor history that got you excited.

I come from a poor background and labor history inherently ties into poverty. The workers movement is about fighting poverty and fighting to make things better for workers. That rings true with almost anybody who comes from a background of poverty and it certainly rang true for me.

Tell me more about your background where you grew up.

My mom raised me and my two siblings in Apple Valley in the high desert right off the 15 Freeway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. We were always in poverty. We faced homelessness most of the time. My mother struggled with amphetamine addiction most of her adult life but sobered up a few years before passing away due to cervical cancer when I was 15. She never had stable work so I never thought about what it would mean to have a career. My father shod horses but he was not in my life as my parents were divorced when I was a year old.

When I say I come from nothing I mean that. There was no economic opportunity in Apple Valley. It’s an economically abandoned area which causes many people to fall into addiction. I’ve struggled throughout my entire life. I’ve never had any true form of stability. The closest things to stability I’ve had was my social circle my best friends my partner my co-workers. When my mom died my grandparents took me and my siblings in.

When did you start to understand there were economic classes in the United States?

I became very aware of economic classes at age 10 or 11. I remember asking my mom “Are we poor?” I could see that she was sad that I asked that question. Despite her struggle with addiction my mom and I had a good relationship.

In the desert a lot of people are poor but I did feel judged in many ways. In middle school I began to realize some stark differences between families. Other kids my age had cell phones and it seemed like a normal thing. I wanted a cell phone too but there was no way we would ever be able to afford one. I never got new clothes for school so class became very easy to recognize.

So now that you have a union what are the next steps?

We need to sit down and negotiate a contract for our store with Starbucks and so far they have been stalling. We submitted our request many weeks ago.



“They are trying to minimize the money they spend on labor in order to maximize the amount of profit they get out of any given day.”



It seems like this effort does not have outside professional union staff making all the decisions about strategy and approach.

I can’t stress enough about the fact that this movement is worker led. We are the union and we are not sitting around doing nothing and waiting for something to happen. We’re all active and we’re all interconnected across the country and we are standing together. We know our rights and we know what Starbucks is doing. And there’s a lot to be said about us being the ones to drive this. In our stores we are the ones who have educated each other and Starbucks can’t destroy that. It’s impossible. We have a force that is powerful. Workers United staff guide us — the union that we are affiliated with — but ultimately we have been empowered to make our own decisions.

How is it that Starbucks extracts more and more profit in the stores?

Our workload doesn’t lessen but what does lessen is the labor that is allotted in our stores. Some days we might have six people on the floor catching all this work. At other times it will be four. They are trying to minimize the money they spend on labor in order to maximize the amount of profit they get out of any given day. And we’re expected to do those numbers no matter how many people we have on the floor. They are raising prices all the time without adjusting anything for us in terms of our income. It’s very clear what they’re doing.

I was at a store recently in Malibu and honestly it looked like a factory or like that “I Love Lucy” episode where Lucille Ball is trying to keep the chocolates from falling on the floor from the conveyor belt.

We are working in what is called a “channel production” process where we are all planted at certain spots essentially repeating the same movements until we are moved to a different spot. For instance one channel is producing food or another will be producing beverages at a single workstation. There are very strict routines that you follow and you repeat them your entire shift. Starbucks put a lot of money and research into developing those processes and those are the process standards that our jobs exist by. Step by step every single day and these steps are laid out in training.

It seems highly regimented and reminds me of factory engineer Frederick Winslow Taylor who developed this worker efficiency method in the late 19th and early 20th century.

Yes there is even a routine for steaming milk that you must follow precisely. There’s an order for how you pull your shots of espresso and how to get syrup into drinks. When you stop working on one beverage you start another beverage. It’s very detail oriented. It’s not yet about how you should move your hands in certain ways but it would not surprise me if that is coming. There are expectations that we must produce a given number of items in a 30-minute period. People definitely get hurt all the time. Falling tripping they get burned. And those time demands are extremely hard to meet but some days we do.



“They simply don’t defend you when you face homophobia in the workplace. Many times I’ve been blamed for a customer’s homophobic comments towards me.”



I’ve heard the drive-throughs are even more demanding.

Yes there are goals they set to measure our success. Monday through Friday we’re expected to have everything prepared at the window for a customer including food and payment processing and beverage in hand within 45 seconds.

And you receive warnings or demerits if these standards are not met?

I’ve seen it happen. “Underperforming” people are met with and encouraged to get to that point of meeting and exceeding the standards set for all of us. It can start off as a verbal warning and then it could escalate all the way to a performance review of your job. The onus is always put on the worker instead of the process itself.

Starbucks has this reputation as being this groovy enlightened progressive company. They hire gay people they let you color your hair purple or put a ring in your nose. So what’s beneath the image?

It’s extremely superficial. They claim inclusiveness and I started in this company because I wanted somewhere I could work that accepted gay people especially coming from a small conservative town. Gay culture is not necessarily part of the mainstream. And I remember going to work at Starbucks and my store manager at the time simply not being OK with how I acted. I said and acted in ways that were very much informed by the fact that I was gay. It was glaringly obvious. Starbucks claims to love gay people but it’s only the acceptable kind of gay or the boxed in kind of gay. And they simply don’t defend you when you face homophobia in the workplace. Many times I’ve been blamed for a customer’s homophobic comments towards me.

Where do you want to be in 10 years? What are your future aspirations?

I want to be firmly planted in the world of labor and helping workers organize for the rest of my life. For me what I’m doing feels right and natural. Being an organizer means to learn to establish trust and make connections with people. It means to help people take back power in the workplace and to build community education and solidarity. When I zoom out and think about this moment it blows my mind what we’ve been able to do. When I zoom in on myself it feels natural and it feels like I’m exactly where I should be. But I’m not going anywhere until we have a contract.

""Just like last time!"" the students shouted in unison their cheers ringing throughout an otherwise quiet Veterans Memorial Stadium.

In a rematch of the 2021 Class 6A state championship St. X prevailed yet again over the Bulldogs 24-10. The Tigers improved to 3-0 with their 15th consecutive win and 800th overall in program history.

""This is just a barometer of where we're at"" St. X head coach Kevin Wallace said after the game. ""(If) we play again in November all of us will be totally different. I mean you don't know what injuries are gonna do; you don't know how people mature (or) how well they're playing in November so those are the ones that you really remember the ones that come in the playoffs. We want to continue to get better as a football team.""

With the loss Male fell to 1-2 on the season and dropped back-to-back games for the first time since 2012. The Bulldogs are 0-2 against St. X since topping the Tigers 28-21 in Week 3 of the 2021 regular season.

""We got a lot of growing up to do with nine new starters on offense and I think seven on defense"" Male head coach Chris Wolfe said. ""I wanted to see our guys fight for four quarters. I saw some of that; we battled we just couldn't finish so this is just a starting point for us.""

Both teams have byes in Week 4 and face tough road matchups when they return to the field. Male travels to Trinity on Sept. 16 while St. X heads across the Ohio River to play Cincinnati’s Elder High School.

Here are three takeaways from the game:

St. X’s defense is the difference-maker

Friday's state championship rematch was a defensive battle from the get-go with Male's Demetrius Dunlap intercepting St. X quarterback Trevor Havill's second pass of the game and returning it 75 yards for a touchdown.

That was the only time the Bulldogs reached the end zone but not for a lack of trying. Bending but not breaking the Tigers allowed Male's offense inside their 10-yard line a couple of times but only surrendered a field goal.

""We were just all locked in"" said St. X senior defensive end Micah Carter a Purdue commit who came up with a couple of key pass deflections at the line of scrimmage. ""We had the same goal so we were all trying to get there. That made us motivated to play.""

The first of Carter's deflections capped off perhaps the most important sequence of the first half. Trailing 17-7 with less than two minutes until halftime Male's offense reached St. X's 4-yard line with backup quarterback Kolter Smith under center. On third and goal Carter swatted Smith's pass to the ground forcing the Bulldogs to settle for three points.

The Tigers scored 17 unanswered points and held Male to just four first downs before intermission thanks in large part to their secondary.

Three different defenders — Christian Coleman Kanon Williams and Jack Fitzgerald — picked off Male's starting quarterback Lucas Cobler during the first half. St. X's offense took over inside Bulldog territory and put points on the board after each takeaway.

""It was a beautiful feeling"" Carter said of his secondary’s big plays. ""I just started blocking. I was so happy. I was too tired to show it but I was happy.""

In the fourth quarter Henry Murr got in on the fun with the Tigers' fourth interception. On one of if not the quickest scoring drives of the game St. X marched down the field and extended its lead to two touchdowns on a goal-line run from senior Adam Boone.

""I’ve said all summer that’s the fastest secondary that I’ve coached at St. X"" Wallace said. ""I thought we did a great job breaking on the ball tonight.""

Tigers overpower Bulldogs in the run game establish Havill at QB

Male entered Friday's game averaging 218.5 rushing yards per contest. Against St. X Daniel Swinney and the Bulldogs' ground attack was held to just 61 yards on 23 carries.

The Tigers on the other hand tallied 191 rushing yards behind a three-headed tailback rotation: Davis Yates Dontre Richardson and Michael Curry.

""We’re huge up front on the offensive line"" Wallace said. ""If those guys continue to get better I like our running backs. That’s gonna be our bread and butter.""

On the quarterback front Wallace turned to Havill for a second straight start after also listing Boone who started the season-opening win vs. Owensboro as a possibility on the depth chart. Boone's only snap under center Friday was a QB draw across the goal line with less than 10 minutes to play in the fourth quarter.

""He balled out last week"" Boone said of Havill who threw for 95 yards and three touchdowns in St. X's rout of Central. ""I took my role as wide receiver and I was just trying to make plays where I am on the field.""

Havill a junior completed 5 of his 9 passing attempts Friday for just 62 yards but one of those completions went to Boone for a 5-yard touchdown. With St. X dominating on the ground and winning the turnover battle Wallace didn't need much from his starting QB except to put the pick-6 he threw in the first quarter behind him.

Another option emerges for Male at quarterback

After Cobler's third interception of the first half Wolfe turned to Smith under center. The junior proceeded to lead the Bulldogs on their most efficient drive of the half which didn't end with a touchdown but at least chipped into St. X's lead.

Smith and Cobler traded snaps sometimes during the same drive for the rest of the night. Combined they completed 16 of their 26 passing attempts for 105 yards.

Despite the loss Wolfe praised both QBs after the game — Smith for providing energy off the bench and Cobler for settling down after his three first-half picks.

Cobler a senior played the entirety of Male’s 12-7 loss at Ballard in Week 2 but moving forward Wolfe said he hopes to also regularly incorporate Smith into the Bulldogs' offense.

""They’re both great kids. They both work real hard"" Wolfe said. ""I think we’ll just have a package for both of them and try to enhance what they do.""

Kicking off Thursday at 11 a.m. this year's Marion Popcorn Festival boasts new activities new acts on its Main Stage and a return to pre-COVID events like the Popcorn Festival 5k Saturday morning and a matinee show in the Marion Palace Theatre Thursday.

This matinee show will kick off the live entertainment Thursday at 2 p.m. in the Palace with the Elton John Experience performed by Tommy Lee Thompson.

Several hours later at 6 p.m. the fan-favorite event the Popcorn Festival Parade will take to the streets.

What's new this year?

Executive Board President Darl Snyder said while he is looking forward to the festival overall he is especially excited to introduce these new events to the community.

""We have a great group of volunteers putting on the event. We have a lot of things planned some new activities we haven’t had for a while. That includes the return of our 5k run on Saturday morning"" Snyder said.

He said the juried art competition held by the Mid-Ohio Fine Arts Society in the Brickyard on Main will come back for another year but with a twist: live acoustic artists are being brought in to perform during the show Friday and Saturday from noon to 7 p.m. for guests to enjoy.

“We’re excited about that again that’s something that’s new” said Snyder.

Festival Co-Director Shelley Rush said festival mascot Poppy the Popcorn will be back again roaming the festival grounds and along with the new activities the pedal tractor pull will be brought back for kids this year.

""We're going to have more for the kids and that actually excites me because we really were short on kids things there for a while there"" Rush said.

According to Snyder a big push this year is stewarding the downtown space well from the businesses that operate there. Volunteers from the festival are going to power wash the sidewalks downtown Sunday following the three days of crowds that could be as large as 250000 attendees.

“There’s always loose ends that we are working on to make sure that we make the event the best it can be and we’re also focusing on being good neighbors with the downtown merchants and business owners and all the amazing work that’s been done there over the years” he said.Located in parking lot at the intersection of Church Street and Prospect Street the main stage's lineup includes headlining acts each night at 8:30 p.m. starting with Bob Seger Tribute Band KatMandu Thursday.

On Friday country band Parmalee takes the stage and rock legend Lita Ford will close out the festival as the Saturday act. Opening acts will go on at 6 p.m. each night before the headliners.

""The entertainment has gone over really well. There's good chatter on Facebook about it. Parmalee and Lita Ford definitely will draw the crowds in"" Rush said.

Snyder said that as the festival prepares to welcome these crowds the goal of the festival is to help showcase the Marion community to residents and guests alike.

“It does bring in quite a few people from out of town and of course is something lot of people in the immediate Marion area come in and enjoy the events from the parade to the national entertainment that’s free you know we’ve got the local bands playing on what we call the Poppin Party Stage"" Snyder said.

“We’ve got a lot of different things going on and it’s all in mind of being able to support and help promote all the renovation and exciting things going on downtown. The revitalization is going on and the new businesses and it’s just wonderful” Snyder later continued.

Road closures

Detours in the downtown Marion area will begin Tuesday at 6 p.m. to begin preparing for the festival. According to the city streets will remain closed until the festival’s conclusion at midnight on Saturday and may remain closed into the early hours of Sunday morning for festival cleanup. Detours during the festival will occur for the following streets:• Center St. between State St. and Campbell St.• Church St. between Main St. and Prospect St.• Main St. between Huber St. and Church St.• Prospect St. between George St. and Church St.• Oak St. between Huber St. and Center St.

To prepare for the Popcorn Parade Thursday Marion Area Transit will be making final pick-ups Thursday at 2 p.m. with final drop-offs scheduled for 2:30 p.m. Normal operating hours will resume Friday.

During the parade the following streets will close beginning at approximately 5 p.m. Thursday and remain closed until parade units have cleared the street:• Forest Lawn Blvd. (closed from E. Center St. to Mt. Vernon Ave.)• Chicago Ave. (closed between E. Center St. and Wilson Ave.)• Johnson St. (closed between E. Center St. and Wilson Ave.)• Boone Ave. (closed between E. Center St. and Wilson Ave.)• Pennsylvania Ave. (closed between E. Center St. and E. Church St.)• Kenmore Ave. (closed between E. Center St. and E. Church St.)

The following streets will be closed until the conclusion of the parade:• East Center St. between Merchant St. and State St. (closing at approximately 5:00 pm.)• S. State St. between Center St. and Columbia St.• S. Vine St. between Center St. and Church St./Mt. Vernon Ave.• E. Church St. between State St. and Vine St.• S. High St. between Center St. and Church St.

Segoviano Management Group Inc. will open its fifth restaurant concept this fall according to Louisville Business First. The group is the owner of restaurants in Louisville and Southern Indiana including La Catrina in New Albany Señor Iguanas in Louisville and Clarksville El Catrin in Sellersburg and Taqueria Don Juan in Clarksville.The new restaurant Sleepy Rooster Morning Kitchen spun out of the weekend brunch offering at La Catrina. Roza Segoviano who owns the group along with her husband Juan said the brunch was successful but they struggled to staff just the brunch portion. Segoviano said it was taxing on the team to get home at 11:30 p.m. on a Friday night and be back at work by 7 a.m. Saturday for brunch. Sleepy Rooster will open in a former Bob Evans location at 2204 State St. in New Albany. It is a little more than 1500 square feet and it will look totally transformed once the renovations are done Segoviano said.The interior will have a modern farmhouse look. The renovations are being done in-house. Segoviano didn't provide the investment amount for the project but she said it was sizable.The restaurant will employ 30 to 40 people and is expected to open by late October. Within the restaurant there will be 130 seats and a garage door which opens to an outdoor patio with 20 additional seats. ""I've always been a brunch person"" Segoviano said in an interview with Louisville Business First. ""Weekend brunch has always been our thing here with friends and family and so to be able to share that with the community and then to see how well they responded to it … it'll be a lot of fun."" Though Segoviano Management Group currently owns all Mexican food concepts Sleepy Rooster Morning Kitchen will have an American menu with some Mexican dishes and décor.She laughed and said it was weird to serve American breakfast dishes like biscuits and gravy in a Mexican restaurant so she said the new American concept makes sense with nuanced Mexican references throughout. The restaurant's name is a nod to Mexican culture. Segoviano said there's a Mexican phrase ""Se me durmió el gallo"" which loosely means ""my rooster overslept.""Other menu items include some of the favorites from La Catrina's brunch like French toast but it will add shrimp and grits chicken and waffles corned beef hash and more. It will also include lunch options like soups salads and sandwiches. It is also expanding its drink menu with a full bar. The menu will include mimosas and bloody marys and other morning cocktails. It also will offer hand-squeezed juices and a full coffee bar. ""We're invested for the long term so we’re hoping any investment we make leading up to opening will pay off"" Segoviano said. ""Hopefully we'll be there for many years to come.""For more on the restaurant owner group and it newest venture you can read Louisville Business First's entire article here."

Industrial production of cement steel petrochemicals and chemicals — in other words the stuff the modern world is made of — accounts for a quarter of all CO2 emissions and demand for raw materials is rising year on year.

Despite the scale of industry’s emissions problem the IPCC says that net zero is “ challenging but possible ” for the sector: “Reducing industry emissions will entail coordinated action throughout value chains … as well as abatement technologies and transformational changes in production processes. Progressing towards net zero GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions from industry will be enabled by the adoption of new production processes using low- and zero-GHG electricity hydrogen fuels and carbon management.”

This is an introduction to two of the abatement technologies in development that will provide industrial manufacturers with an electricity-powered alternative to replace combustion of fossil fuels; a major milestone towards emissions-free materials.

RDH and RDR: Massive temperatures through direct electrification

At Coolbrook we combined technology from space science turbomachinery and chemical engineering to create the Roto Dynamic Heater (RDH) and the Roto Dynamic Reactor (RDR). By running on electricity alone the high-efficiency RDH and RDR can generate the extreme temperatures required for the manufacturing of cement steel petrochemicals and chemicals without the need to burn fossil fuels. Both technologies are being piloted and brought to market in collaboration with ABB.

While the application of these technologies to generate heat is novel its underlying principles are well-established; in the most simplified terms they are gas turbines running in reverse. Instead of using hot gas to rotate blades and generate power electric motors rotate blades to accelerate gas and generate heat for various industrial processes. By accelerating the heated gas to supersonic velocity and then rapidly slowing it down in a diffuser to subsonic velocities Coolbrook’s rotodynamic technology transforms kinetic energy to thermal energy and can generate temperatures of up to 1700 °C and thereby replace coal gas and oil-fired burners that are currently in use.

The RDH technology is the only electric technology capable of providing a high enough temperature level required for cement production which currently accounts for around a third of global industrial CO2 emissions while the RDR technology is best suited for CO2-free steam cracking in petrochemical processes. Combined it is estimated that RDR and RDH can reduce global industrial CO2 emissions by over 2 gigatonnes (Gt) a year and such technologies have the potential to propel these processes towards net zero.

Existing plants can be retrofitted with RDH or RDR without significant structural changes as the commercial units will have a footprint of just a few metres and can be used for a variety of applications allowing for a gradual rather than wholesale switch to electric power. Coolbrook’s RDR and RDH technologies are now being piloted on a large scale and will be ready for commercialisation around 2024.",,,,,,,,,

Whether that is with cell phones or internet many times these communities are left with either very slow and spotty coverage or none at all.

The situation is even more dire in areas where outdoor enthusiasts like to adventure where coverage is nearly impossible. But the recent T-Mobile and SpaceX Starlink announcement gives hope to those in both situations.

Filling in the gaps

While T-Mobile has improved significantly in the past five years to become one of the best wireless carriers in the US there are still plenty of gaps in coverage. But so do the other options like AT&T and Verizon regardless of what any of their maps might say.

Adding cell towers in remote and rural areas is not only difficult but also expensive and is a big reason for so many dead zones.

T-Mobile has been my service provider for years despite its shortcomings because the other carriers are just as bad where I live. T-Mobile offers more value in different ways to help make up for it. I also feel that of all the U.S. carriers T-Mobile is putting in more effort than its competitors to solve connectivity problems — the latest partnership with SpaceX Starlink is a fantastic example.

In short this partnership aims to eliminate dead zones in coverage by combining Starlink internet satellites and leveraging T-Mobile's mid-band spectrum to provide basic cellular connectivity where it otherwise wouldn't be. When your phone is connected through this method initially only SMS MMS supported messaging apps and potentially limited video are available to users. There are hopes to expand it to voice and data down the line.

Even though I know the chances this service will live up to the hype are slim I'm still excited about it. The idea that my family or I won't be stranded on the side of the road with no way to contact someone could be a thing of the past is amazing.

Then again when I go camping: More often than not places I camp don't have very good cellular coverage. Even though one reason I go camping is to disconnect Starlink and T-Mobile could make it so I still have a way to reach someone if needed. But aside from the convenience aspect there are plenty of other benefits that can come from this and future partnerships.

Currently it's only T-Mobile that Starlink is pairing up with but according to the CEO of both companies the goal is to partner with other carriers worldwide. If this can come to fruition it could bring wireless communication to remote parts of the world and also aid in an emergency where people get stranded in areas that otherwise can't be served through traditional service methods.

Both T-Mobile and Starlink have been doing some pretty impressive things in bringing the internet to those who either can't get proper broadband or have extremely limited options. I have reviewed T-Mobile's Home Internet and currently use SpaceX Starlink internet at my home. While I can't personally use T-Mobile for my home internet due to the aforementioned spotty coverage at my house Starlink has for the most part been wonderful.

In order to continue the goal of providing global internet SpaceX will need a lot more satellites in orbit — and it is almost weekly. Starlink will continue to grow to satiate the company's internal goals of being an ISP but that growth will be essential to support that goal of eliminating cellular gaps.

(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)

So while SpaceX and T-Mobile are working on expanding coverage there will need to be changes to the phones we carry to enable us to use the new service. T-Mobile says that most existing phones shouldn't have any trouble using the service so that's great assuming it works. On the software side it's been confirmed that Android 14 will support satellite connectivity.

I know that there is still a long way to go before this new communication method is available across the globe and it won't even be on T-Mobile until late 2023. Then once it launches there are bound to be bugs and availability issues. But the fact that this technology has potential and is being attempted really makes me happy and hopefully can help a lot of people.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vZmFjZS1vZmYvY2hlYXAtdW5saW1pdGVkLWRhdGEtcGxhbnMtY29tcGFyZWQtYXRhbmR0LXZzLXQtbW9iaWxlLXZzLXZlcml6b27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cheap unlimited data plans compared: AT&T vs. T-Mobile vs. Verizon,"Not long ago getting one of the best unlimited data plans from a major wireless carrier meant a big monthly bill each month. And to be sure the top plans that come packed with perks still cost a pretty penny if you turn to AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon.

Unlimited data plans and phone deals These days a lot of phone deals offered by the big carriers require you to sign up for a qualified unlimited data plan to get a discount on a new device. The key word there is ""qualifying."" Some times the cheapest unlimited data plans at AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon are included in these deals and sometimes they're left out. Check each offer carefully to make sure you're getting the right unlimited data plan.

But back in 2018 T-Mobile rolled out Essentials a stripped-down version of its unlimited data plan available at a lower price. Eventually T-Mobile's biggest competitors — perhaps feeling pressured from the best cheap cell phone plans that also include low-cost unlimited data — took notice.

In the past year AT&T and Verizon have both added entry-level unlimited data plans of their own. You won't find much in the way of perks but you may not mind when your cell phone bill arrives at the end of each month.

Knowing what unlimited data plans are out there is especially vital at this time of year when phone makers are rolling out their fall flagship devices. Samsung just introduced the Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Galaxy Z Flip 4 its latest foldables and the iPhone 14 should soon be arriving from Apple. If you're in the market for a new phone it may pay to look for a new wireless plan as well — particularly one that doesn't charge you a lot for unlimited talk text and data.

With that in mind we wanted to compare the lowest-priced unlimited data plans available at the three major phone carriers. You'll find less expensive options at mobile virtual network operators or MVNOs and AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon all offer more feature-packed plans at higher monthly rates. But consider this cheap unlimited data phone plan comparison a good starting point for understanding the going rate for unlimited data these days — especially if you run across the best cell phone deals that require you to sign up for an unlimited data plan.

Cheap unlimited data plans compared: AT&T vs. T-Mobile vs. Verizon

Swipe to scroll horizontally Row 0 - Cell 0 Single-line cost Per line cost 4-line plan Hotspot data Other notes AT&T Value Plus $50 N/A None 5G coverage unlimited talk text and data in Canada and Mexico T-Mobile Essentials $60 $26.25 (includes discounted 3rd line) Unlimited at 3G speeds 5G coverage Includes a year of Paramount Plus Verizon Welcome Unlimited $65 $30 None 5G coverage unlimited talk text and data in Canada and Mexico

Cheap unlimited data plans: AT&T Value Plus Plan

What it costs one line: $50/month

What it costs four lines: N/A

AT&T's Value Plus plan is ideal for people who just need one line of unlimited data and don't require a lot of perks. For just $50 a month Value Plus gives you talk text and data with no limits though AT&T reserves the right to slow your data speeds if its network is congested. That's what separates Value Plus from more expensive AT&T unlimited plans which include a set amount of ""premium data"" or high-speed data that you can use without having to worry about throttling.

AT&T includes 5G coverage through its nationwide network with the Value Plus plan and you'll be able to use your talk text and data when traveling in Mexico or Canada. You can also enjoy unlimited texting from the U.S. to 200-plus countries. But that's about it when it comes to perks.

The biggest limitation with AT&T's Value Plus plan is that families can't take advantage of it — AT&T restricts Value Plus pricing to just one line. If you want to add multiple lines you'll have to opt for one of AT&T's more expensive unlimited plans like the AT&T Unlimited Starter plan ($140 for four lines or $35/line) or AT&T Unlimited Extra ($160 for four lines or $40/line). Of course those plans come with extra perks.

AT&T Value Plus plan: $50/month @ AT&T

AT&T's cheapest unlimited plan doesn't offer perks but it is the least expensive option for unlimited data among the big three phone carriers. Only individuals can take advantage of this deal as AT&T doesn't let you add extra lines of data.

AT&T's next cheapest plan: AT&T Unlimited Stater costs $65 a month for a single line of data. That extra $15/month gets you 3GB of mobile hotspot data per line and you can add multiple lines. Otherwise perks aren't that much different from the Value Plus plan. If you aren't sure either of these is the plan for you it's worth looking at our AT&T Mobility promo codes for other ways to save.

Cheap unlimited data plans: T-Mobile Essentials plan

What it costs one line: $60/month

What it costs four lines: $105/month ($26.25 per line)

T-Mobile's Magenta plan gets all the hype but there's a cheaper option than the $70/month unlimited plan that's the carrier's flagship offering. T-Mobile Essentials offers unlimited data for less though the perks aren't as generous as what you would get with Magenta or the even more expensive Magenta Plus option.

Still Essentials offers more perks than you might expect. In addition to 5G coverage from T-Mobile's top-ranked 5G network you can enjoy unlimited hotspot data though it's restricted to 3G speeds. You can enjoy 50GB of unlimited data before T-Mobile can slow your speeds which gives Essentials a leg up over the cheap unlimited plans from AT&T and Verizon.

Normally to get streaming services included with your wireless plan you have to pay up for more expensive options but Essentials customers do get a year of Paramount Plus for free.

Unlike AT&T's Value Plus plan Essentials supports multiple lines. As of this writing a four-line plan costs $105/month or $26.25 for each line. But note that reflects a current promotion where T-Mobile is waiving the fee on the third line of data. Normally four lines of Essentials will set you back $140 each month.

One big drawback to T-Mobile Essentials is that the rate doesn't include taxes and fees. Other T-Mobile unlimited plans bake taxes and fees into the monthly rate so that you're always paying the same amount.

T-Mobile Essentials Plan: $60/month @ T-Mobile

T-Mobile has the best perks among major carriers for its cheapest unlimited data plan with unlimited hotspot data (at 3G speeds) and a year of Paramount Plus included. Even better you get 50GB of premium data so your speeds won't be slowed if T-Mobile's network is congested.

T-Mobile's next cheapest plan: From Essentials you can step up to the $70/month Magenta plan which will cost a family of four $140 total thanks to that discounted third line. Magenta doubles your premium data cap to 100GB and your hotspot speeds increase to high-speed with a 5GB cap. Multi-line plans get a free Netflix subscription and there are travel benefits like in-flight Wi-Fi too.

Cheap unlimited data plans: Verizon Welcome Unlimited

What it costs one line: $65/month

What it costs four lines: $120/month ($30 per line)

Verizon's Welcome Unlimited is the relative newcomer to this mix of cheap unlimited plans giving you a low entry price for unlimited data through Verizon's far-reach service. You can also get 5G coverage through Welcome Unlimited though that's via Verizon's nationwide 5G network and not the much faster C-Band and mmWave-based 5G available in select cities.

As is commonplace among these cheap unlimited plans perks are few and far between with Welcome Unlimited. You can expect to enjoy talk text and data when you travel to Mexico and Canada but that's about it. Verizon will slow your speeds if you its network gets congested.

Welcome Unlimited's greatest appeal is for families where escalating discounts drop the per-line cost to $30 each month for four lines of data. While Verizon's other unlimited data plans let you mix and match plans you don't have that luxury with Welcome Unlimited.

Verizon Welcome Unlimited Plan: $65/month @ Verizon

Verizon's cheapest unlimited data plan is best for families as the discounts on additional lines drops to the per-line cost to $30 each; that's $120 total. You get 5G coverage from Verizon's nationwide network.

Verizon's next cheapest plan: If you want more perks with your unlimited data the next step up at Verizon is the 5G Start plan which costs $70 a month for just one line. Families pay $35/line for four lines of data. The extra perks include 5GB of hotspot data plus assorted 6-month streaming trials to Disney Plus Discovery Plus Apple Music and whichever gaming service (Apple Arcade or Google Play Pass) strikes your fancy. 5G Play More with its more extensive benefits ups your cost to $80/month. You can also check our Verizon promo codes for other ways to save.

Other cheap unlimited data plans

There are cheaper unlimited plans available if you're willing to look beyond the major wireless carriers turning instead to discount services. Mint Mobile for example charges $30 a month for its unlimited plan though after a three-month trial you need to pay for a full year of service to get that low rate.

Visible which just shuffled up its plans now charges $30 a month for its entry-level unlimited plan without the year commitment that Mint requires. For $45 a month Visible includes perks like international calling and texting plus access to Verizon's fastest 5G network. (Visible is owned by Verizon and uses that carrier's network for coverage.) Tello offers the cheapest unlimited data plan by a $1 charging $29 for unlimited talk text and data.

As we noted with Visible these discount services use the big carriers' towers for their service — Verizon's in Visible's case and T-Mobile's for Mint and Tello. On the bright side that includes 5G coverage through those networks. On the down side your data speeds can be slowed if the parent network is experiencing a lot of traffic.

Cheap unlimited data plans: Which should you pick?

As with any cell phone plan picking the best cheap unlimited data offering from a major wireless carrier comes down to more factors than just price. However if that's your primary concern AT&T is the low-price champ with its Value Plus plan provided you don't need more than one line of data. Families would be better off considering the Welcome Unlimited plan from Verizon particularly if they live in an area where Verizon's coverage is strong.

Perks also play a role in picking a good unlimited plan even if those perks aren't numerous for plans this cheap. Still T-Mobile Essentials includes hotspot data (albeit at slow speeds) and a year of Paramount Plus. It's also the only unlimited plan to promise that your data speeds won't be slowed at least for the first 50GB of data use. Because T-Mobile has the top-ranked 5G network it's also best for 5G coverage even with its cheapest unlimited data plan.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVtb3VudGFpbmVlci5jb20vbmV3cy9mYXN0ZXItY2VsbC1waG9uZS1zZXJ2aWNlLWluLXNpZ2h0LXdpdGgtdC1tb2JpbGUtcm9sbG91dC9hcnRpY2xlX2MzNDA5NTNlLTI5NjUtMTFlZC04NzE0LWVmOWFlMWYzMmJlZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Faster cell phone service in sight with T-Mobile rollout,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

SpaceX has signed a deal with T-Mobile to provide the carrier’s customers with text services from its Starlink satellites anywhere in the US starting next year.

It was only a matter of time before SpaceX turned its attention to the cellular industry. The company has recently ramped up its deployment of internet connectivity allowing everyone from van lifers to remote outposts to be connected to the internet. But cell connectivity is an entirely different thing.

Most people that go to the most remote parts of the world which amounts to half a million square miles in the US alone have to lug around expensive satellite phones if they need to reach someone. But T-Mobile and SpaceX have developed a system whereby Starlink can provide services to customers on existing T-Mobile networks using the phones they already have in their pockets.

SpaceX YouTube video the of partnership announcement with TMobile

That is not the same as providing internet and the system roll-out will start slowly with only text messaging being the first of the three major cell services users expect from their carriers to roll out. Voice calls and eventually data will follow in the future with no specified date for when that might be.

Starlink itself has come under plenty of scrutiny lately as it has continued to infringe upon astronomers’ images of the early night sky. The FCC is undergoing a legal battle involving SpaceX the parent company of the Starlink system to determine whether or not it should be eligible for an $800 million prize pool promised to the entity that provides internet to rural communities in the US.

Even with all the legal frustrations SpaceX has to face it still has to deal with technical challenges as well. Supporting this new cellular infrastructure will require modifications to its existing Starlink 2.0 satellites which were announced in June. Launching those satellites will require Starship to be operational which still doesn’t have a timeline other than potentially some time in the next few months.

Fraser discusses some of the challenges Starlink is facing.

That will give the company and its new cellular partner plenty of time to flesh out the technical details of their agreement. And even some time to coax other cellular providers into joining their collaboration. T-Mobile’s network only reaches the US – to become a genuinely global cell provider the two companies will have to expand their Coverage Above And Beyond framework to other cell operators. So far no one has stepped up to the plate but there are undoubtedly conversations going on behind closed doors.

Ultimately this all leads to the future of seamless internet and cellular connectivity throughout the world which has been the dream of technologists since the dawn of the internet. SpaceX and T-Mobile have taken another step in that direction. It remains to be seen what others will join them.

However what The Sun did not say is that the firm is jumping over the central business district like so many other recent companies have done including: Constellation Energy Legg Mason (now Franklin Templeton) T. Rowe Price Transamerica Ernst & Young Gordon Feinblatt and Saul Ewing. To say that DLA Piper is moving back “downtown” ignores the reality that the large business community has abandoned our city in fact and in spirit (“DLA Piper will relocate Baltimore office back downtown after two decades” Aug. 29).

Most of downtown’s “biggies” completely shut down their offices for two years to allow their employees to work from home while the small businesses that were dependent on them for survival were forced to close or sharply reduce their business. It has been a case of the haves and the have-nots. The biggies did not care. There was a time now long past when Baltimore corporate leaders were our city’s boosters. Through everything that Baltimore has endured — the relentless violence the obsession with (but lack of action regarding) the squeegee kids (entirely at the expense of small downtown businesses) the loss of jobs the decimation of the central business district the closing of small businesses the continuous population decline uncompetitive real estate tax rates (while favored big developers and large companies are beneficiaries of huge special tax breaks at the expense of residents and small businesses) there has been utter and complete silence from our business and civic leaders.

You cannot name the leader of any large company or nonprofit organization who has spoken publicly to raise the concerns that are on everybody’s mind. They are either afraid to do so or they do not care. They simply stand by while our city is dying. Doing nothing and saying nothing. It is tragic. It is morally reprehensible.

Microsoft’s plan to buy Santa Monica based video game giant Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion could have major effects on the gaming industry transforming the Xbox maker into something like a Netflix for video games by giving it control of many more popular titles.

But to get to the next level Microsoft must first survive a barrage of government inquiries from New Zealand to Brazil and from U.S. regulators emboldened by President Joe Biden to strengthen their enforcement of antitrust laws.

In the United Kingdom regulators on Thursday threatened to escalate their investigation unless both companies come up with proposals within five days to ease competition concerns. More than seven months after Microsoft announced the deal only Saudi Arabia has approved it.

“A growing number of countries are subjecting major global transactions to deeper scrutiny” said William Kovacic a former chairman of the five-member U.S. Federal Trade Commission. “Many of the jurisdictions that are exercising that scrutiny are significant economies and can’t be brushed off.”

Microsoft has faced antitrust scrutiny before mostly notably more than two decades ago when a federal judge ordered its breakup following the company’s anticompetitive actions related to its dominant Windows software. That verdict was overturned on appeal although the court imposed other less drastic penalties on the company.

In recent years however Microsoft has largely escaped the more intense regulatory backlash its Big Tech rivals such as Amazon Google and Facebook’s parent company Meta have endured. But the sheer size of the Activision Blizzard merger has drawn global attention.

The all-cash deal is set to be the largest in the history of the tech industry. It would give Microsoft maker of the Xbox console and gaming system control of popular game franchises such as Call of Duty World of Warcraft and Candy Crush. There’s also a growing sense that past review of Big Tech mergers was too lax — such as when Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.

“Collectively that means that the kinds of concessions you’re going to have to make become more difficult” Kovacic said.

The possibility of Microsoft gaining control of Call of Duty has been particularly worrisome to Sony maker of the PlayStation console that competes with Microsoft’s Xbox. In a letter to Brazilian regulators Sony emphasized Call of Duty as an “essential” game — a blockbuster so popular and ingrained that it would be impossible for a competitor to develop a rival product even if they had the budget to do so.

The U.K. watchdog’s preliminary inquiry raised similar worries. It said Microsoft’s control of popular Activision Blizzard games raised concerns that the deal would hurt rivals in multi-game subscription services and the cloud gaming market.

One solution could be a settlement in which Microsoft agrees to ensure that console-making rivals such as Sony or Nintendo won’t be cut off from popular Activision Blizzard games. Microsoft has already publicly signaled its openness to that concept.

Microsoft’s president Brad Smith has said the company committed to Sony to make Activision games like Call of Duty “available on PlayStation beyond the existing agreement and into the future” — although many are skeptical about how long those promises would last if not set into regulatory consent decrees.

On the other hand Microsoft also has a much better reputation in Washington than it did in 2000. It is “seen as more reasonable and sensible” on issues such as data privacy Kovacic said.

Microsoft has also been working to win over skeptics in the U.S. starting with a labor union that’s been trying to organize Activision Blizzard employees. Democratic lawmakers have also expressed concern about allegations of Activision’s toxic workplace culture for women which led to employee walkouts last year as well as discrimination lawsuits brought by California and federal civil rights enforcers.

In March the Communications Workers of America had issued a call seeking tougher oversight of the deal from the U.S. Department of Justice the FTC and state attorneys general. But a June 30 letter from the union to the FTC said it had switched to supporting the deal after Microsoft agreed “to ensure the workers of Activision Blizzard have a clear path to collective bargaining.”

Gaming represents a growing portion of Microsoft’s business despite the company’s efforts to portray itself and Activision Blizzard as “small players in a highly fragmented publishing space” per a document filed with New Zealand’s Commerce Commission.

In 2021 Microsoft spent $7.5 billion to acquire ZeniMax Media the parent company of video game publisher Bethesda Softworks which is behind popular video games The Elder Scrolls Doom and Fallout. Microsoft’s properties also include the hit game Minecraft after it bought Swedish game studio Mojang for $2.5 billion in 2014.

The Redmond Washington tech giant has said the gaming acquisitions will help beef up its Xbox Game Pass game subscription service and its mobile offerings particularly from Activision Blizzard’s King division which makes Candy Crush.

Dutch game developer Rami Ismail said Microsoft’s subscription-based service has thus far been a positive for smaller game studios trying to get their content to users. But he’s unsure about the long-term impact of the merger.

“Xbox Game Pass as a product has been really good in getting interesting creative games funded that might not have the normal market reach to be successful” Ismail said. “On the flip side as power consolidates there is less of an incentive to do anything like that.”

Microsoft rivals are also consolidating. Sony in July closed on a $3.6 billion deal to buy Bungie Inc. maker of the popular game franchise Destiny and the original developer of Xbox-owned Halo. Take-Two Interactive maker of Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption in May completed a $12.7 billion deal to acquire mobile gaming company Zynga maker of FarmVille and Words With Friends.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhbWVyZWFjdG9yLmV1L2EtcGxhZ3VlLXRhbGUtcmVxdWllbS13ZS1nb3QtdG8tcGxheS1hbi1lbnRpcmUtY2hhcHRlci1vZi1hc29ib3Mtc2VxdWVsLWF0LWdhbWVzY29tLTExODczNTMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Plague Tale: Requiem: We got to play an entire chapter of Asobo's sequel at Gamescom,"HQ

There's no denying that this year's Gamescom lacked some serious heavy hitters. With Activision Take-Two Interactive Sony Nintendo and so on all deciding to skip the major convention. But just because these companies weren't in attendance doesn't mean there was a lack of incredibly exciting games that made appearances - with one of those very names being A Plague Tale: Requiem.

HQ

I must confess I wasn't much a huge fan of this series until a few months back when I finally got around to playing A Plague Tale: Innocence which needless to say left me incredibly excited and hopeful for Requiem. That's probably why going into the preview session - where Asobo Studio allowed me to play the entirety of the game's sixth chapter - disappointment wasn't really an option. While I will say this game plays a little differently from the first (mostly for the better might I add) it absolutely didn't let me down. But let me further dive into why.

First of all as you'd expect from a game that is being created for PC and current-gen consoles only and forsaking PS4 and Xbox One unlike its predecessor there are a lot of technological improvements that truly elevate A Plague Tale: Requiem. From larger levels that make life all the more challenging for Amicia and Hugo to navigate as enemies are more challenging to sneak past to better lighting resolution and all the tricks and doodads that make a game look visually striking. The technological improvements are instantly noticeable be it in the facial animations or when wandering through a lush lilac field of lavender it's a significant step-up in quality that is best described in a comparison unique to A Plague Tale - rats.

This is an ad:

HQ

Following my play session I caught up with game director Kevin Choteau as part of an interview that is now live on Gamereactor (see it above). It was here that Choteau told me that the better tech at Requiem's core allows the game to render up to 300000 rats at once up from the max of 5000 that still made Innocence's vile rodent hordes seem unspeakably large. Needless to say there will be plenty of rats again. More than you could ever perceive.

But back to the gameplay and how that has changed in this sequel. As we've been told frequently beforehand in trailers and gameplay videos Amicia and Hugo are a bit older in this game. Not much older might I add but just that little bit older that you can see the weight of the decisions the pair have had to make are pressing on them and changing them. Amicia is no longer a passive protector an individual who sneaks and flees to evade danger. No now she carries a crossbow that allows her to take the fight to her enemies. The ammo economy does mean that Amicia won't be able to gun down any foe that steps in her path but she can cut down enemies with greater ease - something we begin to learn is the reason why the sibling duo are in another sticky and awful situation. Amicia also has some fancy new tools at her disposal be it tar that causes flames to enlarge and the crafting system has been streamlined a tad so it's easy to see which weapons Amicia is using and what ammo is currently loaded up.

Hugo also has some new rat-related powers abilities that allow him to control hordes and guide them to attack enemies with direct precision or even get a gauge on where enemies are wandering around (think rat-powered sonar). It all makes for new ways to tackle each level which as I mentioned earlier are larger and will require more patience and planning to get through without being spotted and overwhelmed by the many enemies.

This is an ad:

And generally speaking this was the theme of the gameplay demo. A Plague Tale: Requiem is bigger prettier more detailed and clearly produced to a much higher budget. There's never any doubt of that. This game is set to be one of the top games of the entire year and if the rest of the story holds up to the quality that this singular chapter exudes then it looks like Asobo might just have a Game of the Year contender on its hands. Needless to say I'm very excited for this game which is why October 18 can't come any sooner for me.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vaW50ZXJhY3RpdmUud3R0dy5jb20vcGxheWxpc3QvMjAyMi8wOS8wNC9ndWlsdC1yZWNhcC1zZWFzb24tMi1lcGlzb2RlLTPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Guilt' Recap: Season 2 Episode 3,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://interactive.wttw.com/playlist/2022/09/04/guilt-recap-season-2-episode-3 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vaW50ZXJhY3RpdmUud3R0dy5jb20vcGxheWxpc3QvMjAyMi8wOS8wNC9ndWlsdC1yZWNhcC1zZWFzb24tMi1lcGlzb2RlLTPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9oZWFsdGgvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMTE3NjI5My9XaHktZGlkLXR3by15ZWFycy1kaWFnbm9zZS1Kb2VsLUF0a2luc29ucy1sZXVrYWVtaWEuaHRtbNIBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9oZWFsdGgvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMTE3NjI5My9hbXAvV2h5LWRpZC10d28teWVhcnMtZGlhZ25vc2UtSm9lbC1BdGtpbnNvbnMtbGV1a2FlbWlhLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why did it take two years to diagnose Joel Atkinson's leukaemia?,"Leukaemia patients are being misdiagnosed or waiting too long for a simple yet vital blood test that can flag up the disease – meaning that many suffer worse illness and may even die when treatment given earlier could have saved them.

In light of the worrying new research two of Britain’s leading blood cancer charities today issue a plea to health chiefs and policymakers to tackle the problem and reduce the grim toll of an illness that kills 5000 Britons every year.

According to official NHS guidance anyone visiting their GP with tell-tale symptoms such as persistent fatigue fever bruising or bleeding and recurrent infections should be referred for a ‘very urgent’ full blood count within 48 hours – a test that costs the NHS as little as £2.65.

But data shared exclusively with The Mail on Sunday suggests just a third of patients are picked up straight away and a quarter go for up to four months and see a GP multiple times before being given the test. In this time the condition can worsen to the point that it’s untreatable.

In one shocking case a 31-year-old electrician went undiagnosed for almost two years.

As his health deteriorated he spoke to doctors and NHS 111 and visited A&E ‘countless’ times suffering crushing fatigue night sweats and excruciating pain.

Father-of-one Joel Atkinson from Bishop’s Stortford in Hertfordshire was hit with severe shoulder and back discomfort in late 2019 which was initially put down to a stressful job and later arthritis.

As his health deteriorated he spoke to doctors and NHS 111 and visited A&E ‘countless’ times suffering crushing fatigue night sweats and excruciating pain. Yet it was only after collapsing at home and being rushed by ambulance to hospital and then into intensive care that he was finally diagnosed with leukaemia.

Other sufferers told similarly disturbing stories of missed opportunities and delays. Julia Jones 74 from Preston says she ‘knew something was seriously wrong’ but was told by her GP that the constant tiredness she was feeling was her age and that the tennis ball-sized lump under her right arm was ‘just raised glands’.

Eighteen months later a routine mammogram picked up a lump in her breast and she was referred for an examination and biopsy.

Retired teacher Julia says: ‘When I raised my arm the doctor saw the old lump – he looked horrified.’

Further investigations revealed that she had chronic lymphocytic leukaemia an incurable form of the disease.

‘It was more than frustrating – I’d found the first lump more than a year before my diagnosis and had seen the GP three times. The breast lump was also related to the leukaemia. I was never given a blood test to check the cause of my symptoms.’

Meanwhile 68-year-old Vivien Martin from Herefordshire dropped three stone ‘without trying’ over two months – and so was sent by her GP for investigations for ovarian and bowel cancer. When these tests came back negative the doctor wrote ‘unexplained weight loss’ on her notes. Only after she insisted on a blood test after four months was her leukaemia discovered.

Vivien who is about to start a new round of treatment to control her condition says: ‘I’m not pushy and I wouldn’t normally question a doctor’s opinion but something made me question it that time and I’ll always be glad that I did.’

A full blood count involves the number and appearance of the different blood cells in a sample being checked in a laboratory. If abnormalities are seen further investigations can confirm a diagnosis.

And timing is of the essence warns consultant haematologist Professor Antonio Pagliuca an expert in blood cancers at King’s College Hospital London. He says: ‘Leukaemia can develop rapidly. Patients can go from the early stages to advanced disease in a few months. A cure is more likely if it’s caught earlier whereas later on people can be so ill they might not be able to cope with aggressive treatment. As it is people may be dying unnecessarily when a full blood count given earlier could have saved their life. It’s a simple test – it’s cheap any lab can do it and the results can be available the same day.’

According to the most recent NHS data 75 per cent of all cancers are picked up by GPs within one or two appointments. But ‘capacity pressures’ and ‘staffing issues’ were sometimes stopping them from ordering full blood counts even when they are aware they should claim leukaemia campaigners.

Although the test itself is quick to carry out a doctor must be available to interpret the results.

Charities Leukaemia UK and Leukaemia Care are now working together to turn the tide.

Julia Jones 74 from Preston says she ‘knew something was seriously wrong’ but was told by her GP that the constant tiredness she was feeling was her age and that the tennis ball-sized lump under her right arm was ‘just raised glands’ - which turned out to be leukaemia

Their Spot Leukaemia campaign being launched tomorrow aims to encourage doctors and the public to be more aware of the signs and symptoms of the disease which can also include unexplained joint or bone pain night sweats unusually pale skin and petechiae – tiny red brown or purple pinprick-like marks caused by bleeding under the skin.

Leukaemia UK chief Fiona Hazell said: ‘We know that early diagnosis can save lives. The sooner leukaemia patients are picked up through a full blood count the sooner they can get treated. The longer the wait the more poorly they become and the fewer options there are.’

Roughly 28 people are given the news they have leukaemia every day in the UK – more than 10000 a year. The disease affects the bone marrow and lymphatic system part of the immune system triggering production of large numbers of abnormal white blood cells.

Normally these fight infections but cancerous white blood cells don’t function properly leaving patients vulnerable to bugs most people would easily shrug off.

They can also ‘crowd out’ red blood cells vital for carrying oxygen around the body and platelets which help the blood clot. As a result anaemia – which causes breathlessness and fatigue – and internal bleeding are common complications of the disease. There are a number of types of leukaemia and they affect all ages including babies and children. However most cases are seen in middle-aged and older people.

Only half of patients survive more than five years making it among the deadliest of cancers.

Overall a third of patients are diagnosed when they become extremely unwell and are admitted to hospital in a crisis. For certain types of leukaemia this figure rises to two-thirds. At this stage they are often too unwell to cope with treatments which can be aggressive.

The age and health of patients is also key – older and more frail patients are less likely to bounce back. But overall those diagnosed early have a 50 per cent chance of surviving the disease while those who are picked up at later stages face a poor prognosis.

For example only 34 per cent of people with acute myeloid leukaemia the most common form of the disease who are diagnosed after an emergency admission survive for a year.

Prof Pagliuca says: ‘If leukaemia is picked up earlier there’s a five to ten per cent greater chance of survival. But often the first time we see a patient is when they’ve suffered significant medical issues such as catastrophic bleeding or a severe infection.

‘In these cases we have to treat those problems before we can do anything about the cancer and some patients don’t recover.

‘This may be due to some patients brushing off their symptoms and not going to the doctor. But we know others do see the GP and are not picked up when it would have been simple to order a full blood count.’

This was certainly the case for Joel Atkinson. He recalls waking up one morning in September 2019 with pain in his shoulder: ‘It was excruciating – a sharp but constant pain that was so bad I could barely move my arm. I went to the doctor who said it was tendonitis and that it wouldn’t last long.’

Joel found the pain would go away then return. ‘Later it travelled to my lower back. I had to go to A&E more than once because it got so bad. It was so confusing because I didn’t remember injuring myself. I was also constantly exhausted and had terrible night sweats.’

After a year hoping to get another opinion Joel decided to move to a different GP surgery.

At this stage he was referred to a rheumatologist and given arthritis drugs. His journalist wife Amy 29 says: ‘Joel was booked in for an MRI scan to check the condition of his joints but because of the pandemic this was delayed for five months.’ In July he had the scan. On the day he was due to go and collect the results Amy went into their bedroom to find Joel in agony. ‘His lips had gone blue’ she recalls still clearly shaken.

He was rushed into intensive care where he was treated for sepsis – a life-threatening immune system reaction to an infection. Only after this was he finally diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

The MRI scan results showed there was no problem with Joel’s joints but there were lesions in the bone marrow inside his spine which is a sign of leukaemia.

‘That’s why he had been suffering back pain’ says Amy. ‘It was a shock because up to that point everyone had been telling us he had arthritis. It was terrifying – and I was also angry. We felt so let down.’

Defying all odds Joel recovered from the sepsis and was out of intensive care after two days. In September he started chemotherapy – and developed near-fatal sepsis again.

‘I was sedated so I don’t really remember much of it’ says Joel.

Amy however recalls it vividly: ‘It was the most traumatic thing ever seeing the person you love the most go through that. But I had this stubborn belief that everything would be OK.’

Incredibly Joel pulled through again – and it turned out that round of chemo had been a success. It had cleared the cancer and he is still in remission.

Now Joel and Amy who have a daughter Isla five are committed to raising awareness about the condition that nearly killed him. ‘I had all the symptoms’ he says. ‘I’m fit and play football but I was so exhausted I couldn’t walk up the stairs at times. I was having night sweats that drenched the bed and lost a lot of weight. I’d told my doctors all of this.’

Amy continues: ‘It’s important all GP get better support and training to help them spot the signs.’

Professor Martin Marshall Chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners said a problem faced by GPs is that leukaemia symptoms can be similar to those of more common and less serious conditions: ‘An average full-time GP may see one new case of blood cancer a year and will make around 8000 patient contacts’ he says.

‘We need to increase the cancer workforce across the NHS including in primary care.’

Leukaemia Care chief executive Zack Pemberton-Whiteley says the charities want both patients and GPs to be more aware of the symptoms: ‘A full blood count is needed to rule out leukaemia and can also help explore what other causes there might be for the patient’s symptoms. NICE [the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence] guidelines clearly state that a full blood count is urgent when leukaemia symptoms are present for any of these symptoms alone.’

T O UNDERSTAND THE future of America don’t head to Washington DC . Instead talk to the governors of its most conservative state Mississippi and its most progressive one California.

Bespectacled and calmly confident Mississippi’s Republican governor Tate Reeves is on a high. It was his state’s 2018 ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy that returned the issue to the Supreme Court setting the stage for the reversal of Roe v Wade in June a decision which gave all state governments the freedom to decide their own abortion regimes.

In August at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Dallas Mr Reeves boasted of his state’s other bans: on vaccine mandates; on teaching critical race theory; on transgender students taking part in school sports on the basis of the gender with which they identify. “I think Mississippi has led on social and cultural issues for years” he says and he plans to keep that lead. Though he declines to say which policies he and the Mississippi legislature will target next “there will certainly be opportunities for us to do [more].”

Some 2700km (1700 miles) away California’s governor Gavin Newsom is as depressed as Mr Reeves is upbeat. “It’s the great unravelling” he says. “All the progress that I’ve enjoyed in my 50-plus years all being unravelled in real time.”

Californian Democrats are reasserting the liberal values he sees threatened. A law Mr Newsom signed in June protects people who get or facilitate abortions in California from lawsuits filed in states where abortion is banned. He recently began dangling tax credits in front of companies which might be considering moving out of states that impede reproductive gay and trans rights. California is also considering declaring itself a “sanctuary state” for trans-identifying children shielding them from court actions by states that penalise surgery aimed at aligning their bodies with their professed identities.

Mr Newsom does not see this as differentiation. He sees it as active defence. “I want to punch the bullies back” he says. “I don’t like what they’re doing.” He has used campaign funds to throw those punches. “I urge all of you living in Florida to join the fight or join us in California where we still believe in freedom” he said in a TV ad which aired on the opposite coast: “Freedom of speech freedom to choose freedom from hate and the freedom to love.”

There is however one thing that unites Mr Newsom and Mr Reeves. They both believe the federal government receives too much attention. Increasingly policies that matter in people’s lives are originating in the states.

Those policies reflect America’s growing ideological polarisation. “State policies vary more than they ever have before” says Chris Warshaw of George Washington University co-author of a forthcoming book “Dynamic Democracy”. As states go in different directions on social and economic policy the consequences will be deeply felt by all Americans regardless of their place on the political spectrum with implications around the world.

To quantify the divergence among states Mr Warshaw and Devin Caughey of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology analysed 190 policies from the 1930s to 2021. On the whole states have become more liberal. They have unwound for example racial restrictions bans on women serving on juries and laws criminalising sodomy.

Caughey and C. Warshaw 2022; The Economist Although the general movement has been to the left states’ presidential voting patterns have shifted to reflect their policy preferences. However states have also moved farther apart on policy with a much larger gap between those most to the right and those most to the left. Data for 2022 are likely to show “massively more divergence” predicts Mr Warshaw. Take California and Mississippi. They have moved to the left and to the right respectively since 1970 with small exceptions (when a southerner Jimmy Carter won over Mississippians and Ronald Reagan wooed California). The difference in terms of state-level policy is more recent and more dramatic. Meanwhile formerly centrist states like Vermont or Kansas have implemented policies to match the party they have moved towards in presidential elections. Liberal-Republican and conservative-Democrat states like Alaska or Arkansas have all but disappeared.

These trends are true of the states in general. Those likely to vote Republican in presidential elections are becoming more conservative in terms of state poli­tics; the same broadly speaking holds for Democrats though the effect is only seen in more strongly Democratic states.

Consideration of abortion alone would seem to make Mr Warshaw’s prediction of more divergence a sure thing. Roe v Wade stopped states from banning abortion prior to fetal viability (around 24 weeks). With Roe overturned 12 states now have an outright ban and two ban it at the sixth week of pregnancy. When all the states have responded to the overturning of Roe it is expected that half will have enacted bans or severely curtailed access.

Why do people break up?

Some in the other half are passing laws to codify abortion rights or protect health-care providers. Connecticut has expanded access by allowing physician assistants and nurse-midwives to perform abortions. In August Kansans defeated a proposed constitutional amendment restricting abortion. There will be measures on abortion on at least five state ballots this year a record. In two of them California and Vermont voters are expected to enshrine reproductive rights in their constitutions.

But there is more than reproductive rights at stake. Guns are another battleground. So far this year ten states have imposed new restrictions on the purchase or carrying of firearms. Meanwhile states with Republican governors and legislatures are pushing for fewer restrictions. Many have embraced “permitless carry” laws which remove all restrictions on gun-owners being armed in public. In June Ohio became the 23rd state to allow this. The same month its Republican governor Mike DeWine signed a law lowering the number of hours’ training that teachers require if they are to bring guns into classrooms from 700 to 24.

The treatment of undocumented immigrants is a third area of divergence. Enforcing immigration law has generally been taken to be the prerogative of the federal government. Increasingly though states are changing the experience and outcomes for their undocumented residents. Through various laws California has “de facto legalised” undocumented immigrants says Ken Miller a professor at Claremont McKenna College. In June it became the first state to start offering Medicaid the government health-insurance scheme for the poor to all low-income adults regardless of immigration status.

Texas is pushing in the opposite direction. Its governor Greg Abbott has declined to expand Medicaid to any more low-income Texans let alone non-citizens. He has ordered state police to start bringing unauthorised immigrants back to the border. Mr Abbott has also said he wants to stop paying for undocumented children to attend public schools. What the children who do go to school must be taught (such as ethnic studies in California or African-American and Latino studies in Connecticut) and must not be taught (such as critical race theory in a number of states) is a whole other story.

Another area where state policies are starting to have national impact is that of voting and election administration as it relates to early voting access voter ID requirements mail-in voting and whether felons should be re-enfranchised. In 2021 29 states expanded access to voting by mail while 13 states restricted it. Many Republican-dominated states are taking aim at election administration for example by shifting oversight authority away from non-partisan bureaucrats to political actors. This could complicate states’ certification of election results.

America’s national identity as a collection of states is written into the country’s very name. The 13 colonies-turned-states were wary of federal power subjugating their own. They needed to be assured of autonomy if they were to ratify the constitution. That need was most acutely felt when it came to the degree of autonomy slave states felt they needed for their own race-based subjugations but the issue was broader than that. The founders thought a federal republic of distinct and diverse states would be protected from the spread of dangerous zealotry. As James Madison wrote “The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular states but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other states.”

Then turn around and make up

The federal model that was enshrined in the constitution is not unique. Australia Canada and Germany have similar architectures of power. But the American model has particular features perhaps most notably its tenth amendment which explicitly confers to the states “the powers not delegated” to the federal government.

Countries like Canada and Australia are more resolved in what dominion the federal government can enjoy according to Don Kettl professor emeritus at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. In America by contrast “There has never been true stability in the relationship between states and the federal government.”

One way to think about the state-federal relationship is as a tug-of-war. For most of the country’s history states have had the rope pulled over to their side of the field. In 1861 fearing that the pull on the rope from the federal government was getting too strong the states of the South went so far as to secede. When they returned to the Union after the civil war the slavery they had allowed was indeed prohibited by the constitution. But the states of the South and North alike remained empowered.

The Great Depression and President Franklin Roosevelt’s belief in the necessity of mounting a strong national reaction saw a movement in the opposite direction. The New Deal was the start of half a century of a more invigorated federal government. The second world war reaffirmed national purpose; the successes of the civil-rights movement came at the explicit expense of what state governments in the South considered their rights. Other federal investments regulations and court cases followed standardising welfare programmes the drinking age environmental protections and more. America became more uniform.

Political scientists say the 1980s was the point when the tug-of-war reversed itself again. Ronald Reagan set about returning power to the states in what he dubbed “new federalism”. In the 1990s when 60 years of almost continuous Democratic control of the House of Representatives came to an end this fell into step with a new national polarisation.

Good or bad

It was only after the stalemated presidential election of 2000 when America spent weeks staring at two-tone technicolour electoral maps on cable-news channels that people first began to speak of red states and blue states. It proved a telling shift an easy way to essentialise political distinctions. During Barack Obama’s administration red states began tugging hard on the rope. Some rejected federal policies like the Affordable Care Act. State attorneys-general also started taking on a greater role as they took their battles against Washington to court. Texas became the chief judicial resister.

At that point the increase in states’ willingness to use their rights could be seen in a specific partisan frame: a red arrow against a blue source of centralised power. But the years of Donald Trump’s presidency saw a similar inverse strategy of resistance by the blue states. California became the centre of resistance and crafted its own policies in response to Washington DC  including on climate change and immigration. The willingness of state governments to take action against the party in federal power became one of the few remaining bipartisan aspects of American politics.

The covid-19 pandemic in which states were empowered to set their own policies further underscored how different states’ paths could be with blue states favouring mask and vaccine mandates and business closures and red states opposing them. Covid also pushed states apart as they took a side in a national battle over whether to prioritise economic or public health. Kevin Stitt the Republican governor of Oklahoma gives covid-19 and the various political reactions to it as part of the reason why “there has never been a bigger difference between a blue state and a red state”.

The differences go well beyond just hot-button ideological issues and rules on voting. Take economic policy. States have long differed in their tax strategies their attitudes to unionisation and their imposition of regulations on business. In a dissenting opinion on the sale of ice in Oklahoma City Louis Brandeis a Supreme Court justice wrote in 1932 that “A single courageous state may if its citizens choose serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.” The pleasing metaphor took hold. For much of the period that followed the ability for states to experiment in economic matters continued to be seen as one of the federal system’s strengths.

Today the range of economic policies being tested in the states’ laboratories has expanded to include minimum wages paid sick leave the categorisation of certain types of formerly freelance workers as employees in response to the growth of the gig economy and more. Benefits and protections vary significantly based on one’s state of residence. Policies to encourage the fight against climate change and reduce its costs are particularly divisive. In August California announced it would ban the sale of petrol-powered cars from 2035. In July West Virginia said it would stop doing business with five major banks which have been critical of coal usage.

For businesses that operate on a national scale the growing variation in economic regulations creates headaches and blunts the advantage of having a large open domestic market. There is also the challenge of tip-toeing through the minefield of social and cultural issues which politicians in red “pro-business” states are choosing to care about. In Florida this year Disney unwilling to alienate a substantial number of its employees opposed a bill aimed at restricting discussions of sex sexuality and gender identity in public classrooms. As a result Ron DeSantis Florida’s governor revoked various privileges the company had enjoyed.

If all this diversity really could be taken as experimentation aimed at finding the best policies for all the costs might be worth it. Unfortunately the ability for success to diffuse from one state to the rest is increasingly impaired. Jacob Grumbach a professor at the University of Washington and author of a book “Laboratories against Democracy” has studied policy-sharing among states and found that “partisan diffusion” had become more common with states emulating policy only from other states controlled by the same party. States learn from each other how to be more thoroughly blue or red not how to better serve their citizens. Laboratories of democracy are splitting into “separate partisan ‘scientific’ communities” he argues.

Happy or sad

If policies do not diffuse though people might. Recently domestic migration has favoured big red states like Texas and Florida at the expense of big blue ones like California and New York. Political pushes to the right by red-state legislatures could slow or reverse that trend; Mr Newsom certainly hopes so. If people increasingly choose states on political grounds the country will become even more divided.

That aside there are two reasons to think that states will continue to diverge. First they are being handed more power to set their own agenda. In his concurring opinion in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organisation the decision which overturned Roe Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the Supreme Court should revisit the “demonstrably erroneous decisions” in which the due-process clause of the constitution had been applied to cases involving gay marriage sodomy and married couples’ access to contraception in a way which took authority from the states. The Supreme Court has also given states more authority over elections whittling at the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965.

This attitude is not entirely consistent; in the same session that it overturned Roe the court also struck down a New York gun law. There seem to be rights the court’s Republican majority wants the states to have and others it is less keen on. But the former look likely to outnumber the latter.

Passionate intensity United States number of state governments under unified party control by party 50 40 30 20 Democrat 10 Republican 0 1950 60 70 80 90 2000 10 20 Source: National Conference of State Legislatures

A second reason to think states’ divergence will continue is because of the polarisation between the two parties and their capture of states. Today there are 37 “trifecta” states in which one party controls the governorship and both chambers of the state legislature: 23 are Republican-controlled 14 Democratic. Thirty years ago there were only 19. Then less than a third of Americans lived in a state with a government controlled by a single party. Today nearly three-quarters do.

More single-party control increases policy divergence. Opponents cannot stop legislation they disagree with and there is no incentive for politicians to reach across the aisle or appeal to median voters. Legislators worry only about competition from primary challengers and are more likely to skew to extremes.

Redistricting which is controlled by legislatures in most states makes this worse by further reducing political competition. During its next session the Supreme Court will rule on a case in North Carolina determining whether state courts can weigh in on elections and redistricting or if state legislatures should have unfettered power in such matters. If the justices rule in a way that empowers the legislatures it could enhance gerrymandering and further diminish political competition.

The founders may have intended the borders between states as firebreaks against the “mischiefs of faction” but state politicians’ adherence to national issues and parties have proved too infernal. A central irony about the factional fighting taking place over state politics is the degree to which its effect has been a national one. National interest groups such as the National Rifle Association have increased their role in getting enthusiasts in one state to press for legislation modelled on that in another. Republican groups have been better at doing this than Democratic ones says Mr Newsom. “These guys understand bottom-up we don’t. They’ve been in the long game we haven’t.”

The fact that the base responds to nationally promulgated ideology helps explain why state politicians are moving to positions far beyond voters’ views and devoting time to issues of little practical import within the state. Around half of Ohioans favour some level of legal abortion; their representatives are proposing a total ban. When Mr DeSantis issued a press release announcing a bill targeting critical race theory and corporate wokeness none of the ten examples he provided came from the Sunshine State.

David French a conservative thinker looked at the consequences of all this division in a book “Divided We Fall” published in 2020. He believes that “there are unhealthy and healthy forms of federalism”. Today’s seem firmly in the first category. As an example he points to a proposed law in South Carolina that tries to restrict free speech around abortion barring any website from hosting or publishing information about abortion access. “Bounty-hunter” laws by which states give new powers to private citizens rather than to themselves are another disturbing example. Texas pioneered this approach with a law allowing any citizen to sue abortion providers. California fired back by letting people sue gun-makers.

Where does all this disunity lead? As voters wake up to the strong influence states will exert over their lives there will be more attention paid to their politics. The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) for example is diverting several hundred million dollars away from the federal level to invest in state constitutional issues and state Supreme Court-justice races (although it will not endorse political candidates). “There’s great possibility there” says Kary Moss of the ACLU ; some state constitutions provide greater protections for rights than the federal constitution.

At the same time states seem increasingly interested in not just divergence but conflict. In 2016 California passed a “sanctions regime” banning state money from being used for non-essential travel to states that discriminate against gay and trans people. There are now 22 states on the travel-ban list; (Mr Newsom came under political fire in June for taking a holiday in Montana which is one of them). Regimes which restrict communication and travel between states even if for the most part symbolically can only make relations more acrimonious.

There will be legal conflict too. Several states are not content just to limit abortion within their boundaries; they want to punish people out-of-state who aid and abet abortions. This seems likely to bring them into confrontation with states like California and Connecticut which are passing new laws to protect citizens from lawsuits regarding abortion facilitated by other states. There are echoes here of the tussles between southern and northern states before the civil war. With the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 it was decided that escaped slaves in free states had to be returned to their owners with the help of the federal government. In interstate abortion battles the federal government may well be forced to get involved too at least in court.

Let’s stay together

The most extreme outcome would be if today’s disunity led again to a real possibility of secession. That remains highly unlikely. But in a recent survey of nearly 9000 Americans conducted by researchers at the University of California Davis half the respondents said there would be a civil war in America within the next few years. Searches for “secession” shot up in the aftermath of the 2020 election. If 2024 sees a constitutional crisis in which states rather than just individual politicians within them use new powers to reject the result the voters intended the country’s constitution and its constituent parts will face a serious test."

Should you buy the shares of Transport Corporation of India?

Taking the results into consideration of Transport Corporation of India (TRPC) the research analysts of the broking firm Motilal Oswal said “We continue to see TRPC as a long-term play backed by: a) a diversified clientele b) improving share in the LTL business in the Road Freight division and c) elevated contribution from the high-margin Seaways segment. We expect TRPC to clock a revenue/PAT CAGR of ~18%/19% over FY22-24. The stock trades at 14x FY24E EPS. We maintain our Buy rating on the stock with a target price (TP) of INR860 (based on 17x FY24E EPS).""

The research analysts of the broking firm Sharekhan said “Transport Corporation of India (TCI) reported better-than-expected consolidated revenues of Rs. 903 crore (up 29.7% y-o-y up 0.6% q-o-q) during Q1FY2023 led by low base along with sustained demand momentum from Q4FY2022. All three key verticals viz. Seaways (revenues up 32.5% driven by higher freight rates) SCM (up 33.5% y-o-y led by auto sector demand revival) and Freight (up 30.8% y-o-y although down 3.6% q-o-q led by MSME slowdown) fared well. However consolidated OPM at 11.5% (down 177 bps q-o-q) was lower than our estimate of 12.9%. All three verticals viz. Seaways (rising input costs) freight (lower LTL mix) and SCM (inability to pass thru higher fuel costs in large accounts) felt sequential pressure on OPM. Overall consolidated operating profit/net profit rose by 37%/66% y-o-y at Rs. 104 crore/Rs. 78 crore. The management retained its topline and bottom line growth guidance of 10-15% y-o-y for FY2023 conservatively factoring a bit of slowdown towards the fag end of the fiscal year. Its Capex plan of Rs. 300 crore remains unchanged although it is yet to zero in on a ship for acquisition.""

“TCI’s multi-modal capabilities are expected to benefit it from the logistics sector’s growth tailwinds led by GST government thrust on schemes such as Atmanirbhar Bharat PLI-led manufacturing push and global supply chain re-alignments. The seaways division is expected to sustain strong performance led by increased freight rates although gradual normalization of OPM is expected. The addition of one more ship would be keenly awaited and provide further fillip to its seaways division. We expect TCI to be on a long-term growth trajectory driven by positive sectoral fundamentals and its inherent strengths and capabilities. We retain our Buy rating on the stock with a revised SOTP based target of Rs. 850 lowering our valuation multiples to factor in the near-term macro headwinds affecting especially the MSME segment"" further added the research team of Sharekhan Ltd.

According to data from the food ministry the government procured 2.62 lakh tonnes of paddy against the target of 6.50 lakh tonnes during the last Boro collection season – 59.61% less than the target.

Conversations with farmers of different districts and the officials of the food department have revealed that the government bought paddy for Tk1080 per maund from all over the country during the Boro season. But before the government's procurement process began prices in the open market rose close to that and became higher shortly after. As a result the farmers did not show much interest in selling paddy to the government. In addition due to the production damage caused by natural disasters in some regions paddy collection was low.

However most of the millers sold rice to the government as it was binding in their contract. Otherwise their licenses would have been suspended and the security deposit confiscated. That is why the collection of rice has been good even though the collection of paddy lagged behind.

The government is not that worried about the low paddy procurement as it has solid food grain reserves sources said.

Md Shakhawat Hossain director general of food told The Business Standard ""The main goal of paddy collection is that farmers get good prices which they did. Our stock is also good in the last few years as the rice procurement has been good.""

Food Minister Sadhan Chandra Majumdar recently said that farmers have got a good price for paddy this time. The main objective of buying paddy is to create a competitive market so that farmers can sell the paddy at a fair price.

Altogether 11.16 lakh tonnes of rice were procured against a target of 11.50 lakh tonnes of parboiled and atap rice.

The procurement started on 28 April and ended on 31 August. This time the government bought boro paddy at Tk27 per kg parboiled rice at Tk40 per kg and atap rice at Tk 39 per kg.

Currently the government has a total stock of 19.68 lakh tonnes of food grains including 18.28 lakh tonnes of rice and 1.40 lakh tonnes of wheat.

According to the Bogura Food Controller's office farmers were less interested in selling paddy because the price of paddy in the open market was higher than the government fixed price.

In Bogura 53493 tonnes of parboiled rice have been collected against the target of 61735 tonnes from the district's 12 upazilas. However only 7631 tonnes of paddy have been collected against the target of 25341 thousand tonnes.

Bogura food controller Mohammad Ashrafuzzaman said ""Due to natural calamities some paddy has been destroyed in the region. Therefore the farmers could not deliver the paddy to the warehouse.""

In Naogaon the northern district known as a granary production was severely damaged by storms and floods during the last Boro season. As a result the price of paddy in the market increased and paddy was sold in the open market at a price higher than the price set by the government.

Only 4% of the target has been achieved in this district. No paddy could be collected from 4 upazilas out of 11 upazilas of this district.

Rezaul Islam a farmer of Komarpur village of Badalgachi upazila and Jamal Hossain a farmer of Moharpur village of Mahadevpur upazila said that during the last Irri-Boro season the crops suffered a lot due to natural calamities. As the production of paddy was low the market was also high. At the beginning of the season the price of paddy was Tk1100-1200. Then after 15-20 days it was sold for Tk1300-1450. Now the price of old Katari and Miniket ranges from Tk1500-1600 per maund while the price of Parija is Tk1100 per maund.

Naogaon District Food Controller Alamgir Kabir said ""Initially the price of paddy in the local market was low but later it increased. Some farmers sold rice to the government warehouses when the market price of paddy was low. As the price of paddy in the local market was high the collection campaign could not be successful. Farmers have sold paddy at higher prices in the local market.""

Conditions were similar in Jashore Brahmanbaria and Netrokona.

Farmers have said that if the moisture content of the rice is more than a certain level the government does not take the rice.

On the other hand after the sale of paddy money is paid through farmers' accounts. Many farmers do not sell paddy to the government in order to stay away from bank-related problems as they are more comfortable with cash transactions.

Netrokona district Food Controller Mizanur Rahman said ""Paddy needs to be dry and have a certain moisture level. But because of the floods the local farmers' paddy was not of good quality. Most of the paddy had turned black. For the same reason even the farmers here did not bring their paddy to the warehouse.""

In Boro season 2021 the government had a target of procuring 10 lakh tonne parboiled rice and 1 lakh tonne sun-dried rice of which about 10.60 lakh tonne Boro parboiled rice and 85503 tonne sun-dried rice were procured. On the other hand the paddy collection was 3.62 lakh tonne against the target of 6.5 lakh tonne.

Fluorochemicals speciality chemicals packaging films technical textiles coated fabrics and laminated fabrics are among the company's business categories. The firm serves its customers in more than 75 countries throughout the world thanks to its presence in India Thailand South Africa and Hungary. After announcing a bonus share in 2021 the shares of SRF Ltd. are one of the multibagger stocks that have made investors crorepati in the long run.

Bonus share history of SRF Ltd and its impact on investment

The shares of SRF Limited closed on Friday at ₹2604.90 apiece down 2.30% from the previous close of Rs. 2666.35. The stock price has risen from ₹2.06 as of 1st January 1999 to the current market price which marks a multibagger return and an all-time high of 126351.46% in the last 23 years. The investment of Rs.1 lakh in the company in the year 1999 would have given you 48543 shares of the stock. The company has given bonus shares only once to date that is on 13th October 2021.

The bonus issue of the company is in the ratio of 4:1. Which asks us the question of its worth in the year and the total shareholding. As mentioned above that Rs. 1 lakh investment had given 48543 shares of the stock which was worth Rs. 5.74 Crore at the beginning of the year 2021 which is profitable but still after the bonus issue the total number of shares an investor had quadrupled making its count to 242715 shares which ultimately skyrocketed the worth and the wealth of the investors. At the current market price the 242715 shares of SRF Ltd are worth Rs. 63.22 crores.

Q1FY23 Result of SRF

The company recorded an EPS of ₹20.51 Cr in the quarter ended June 2022 compared to ₹13.34 Cr recorded in the same quarter last year.

Should you buy the shares of SRF?

The research analysts of the broking firm Sharekhan have recently said that “We met the management of SRF Limited to understand the company’s business outlook and growth plans. Management intends to spend heavily on the chemical segment with capex plan of Rs. 12500 crore which is 83% of total capex plan of Rs. 15000 crore over the next five years. Management sounded confident of growing consistently at more than 20% and sustain RoCE of 20%+ in specialty chemical business. The company is seeing a number of growth opportunities from import substitution in the fluoropolymers space (PTFE plant nearing completion by Q3FY2023) industrial chemicals (would get support from chloromethane expansion) and new business opportunity from Europe could emerge from likely disruption in Europe’s chemical industry amid geopolitical tensions.""

They further added that “High growth in the chemical business supported by high capex intensity sustained strong margin for the technical textiles business and focus on value-added products (VAP) in the packaging film business would drive strong revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 16%/16%/19% over FY2022-FY2024E and healthy RoE/RoCE of 22%/23%. Investment in the right areas of the specialty chemical business would improve earnings quality and safeguard from cyclical packaging film margins. Superior earnings growth outlook strong FCF generation and robust balance sheet keep us constructive on SRF and justify its premium valuations. Hence we maintain our Buy rating on SRF with a revised price target (PT) of Rs. 2960 (valued at 33x its FY2024E EPS; the increase in PT reflects higher PE multiple given focus on the high-growth specialty chemical business). At the CMP the stock is trading at 34.1x its FY2023E EPS and 28.6x its FY2024E EPS.""

In this article we round up some of the latest “firsts” among suppliers of automotive ICs including Ethernet switches and IMU (inertial measurement unit) solutions.

Broadcom’s 50G Automotive Ethernet Switch

Ethernet switches are essentially the backbone of an automotive security system. In the networking communication world dedicated Ethernet cables are used to transmit and receive information. In contrast automotive Ethernet switches have a single-twisted cabling used to transmit and receive data simultaneously.

The 50G BCM8958X offers improved communication through the zonal ECU to enhance vehicle safety in any operating mode. Image (screenshot) used courtesy of Broadcom

With that in mind in late May Broadcom announced what it claims is an industry first with the roll out of its 50G Ethernet Switch for automotive systems. The BCM8958X is a high bandwidth monolithic automotive Ethernet switch device that will allow for in-vehicle networking applications to encompass large bandwidth capabilities says Broadcom.

The device feeds the needs of the latest vehicle designs which are integrating complex in-vehicle networks. These networks need to be organized with improved streamlined communication between the sensors high-resolution cameras and displays.

Each area of the automotive system is broken up into function based groups called zones. The BCM8958X is equipped with 16 Ethernet ports with 6 ports hitting 10 Gbps and an integrated Ethernet 1000BASE-T1 transceiver. It is capable of encoding physical layer functions to establish noise mitigation reliability and deter transmission jitters.

According to the company the BCM8958X is Broadcom’s 7th generation of its family of integrated L2+ multilayer Ethernet switch solutions for automotive applications. The 55 Gb/s device surpasses its predecessor which is a Gbit multilayer Ethernet switch.

For the new device the main upgrade has been the integration of an Arm Cortex-M7 processor and dedicated on-chip SRAM which gives the switch the ability to send and receive frames in real-time. Utilizing this higher bandwidth switch enables low-powered subsystems to perform traffic filtering and automotive cable diagnostics with the current functional state of the vehicle. More information is available from the BCM8958X product brief.

ST’s Automotive IMU Provides Embedded ML

For its part STMicroelectronics’ (ST’s) most recent “first” in the automotive space also announced in late May is what it claims is the first automotive IMU to embed machine learning (ML) capabilities. The device builds on ST’s technology developments micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and actuators.



The ASM330LHHX IMU leverages MEMS with a 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis gyroscope in a 2.5 mm x 3 mm footprint. Image used courtesy of STMicroelectronics

The ASM330LHHX offers a coupled 3-axis module that provides higher degrees of freedom than most IMUs in the market according to ST. Its 6-axis capability consists of a 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis gyroscope. A quick search of 6-axis MEMS-based accelerometers will show solutions targeting portable navigation devices wearables drones and augmented reality. ST is leveraging its capabilities in MEMS to establish the same stability for each sensor and the noise mitigation but in automotive systems.

Vehicle positioning and digital stabilization are sensing functions that benefit from the 6-axis module. And at its core the IMU runs various AI algorithms directly on the sensor which ensures low latency between any outside occurrence and the vehicle's response. In low power mode the current flow is less than 800 µA for both the accelerometer and gyroscope. That means it can run continuously for anti-theft systems motion-activated functions and vibration monitoring.

Provided in a 2.5 mm x 3 mm x 0.83 mm SiP (system in package) configuration the device is designed to address automotive non-safety applications such as vehicle alarms tracking and monitoring black-box systems and navigation assistance.

The ASM330LHHX has two operating modes: Always-On and High-Performance. According to ST these modes boost performance and accuracy for precise positioning vehicle-to-everything (VX2) communication impact detection and crash reconstruction. More information is provided in the ASM330LHHX’s datasheet.

Marvell’s Automotive Ethernet Switch with Lockstep Tech

Claiming another automotive industry first is Marvell with the announcement of an automotive Ethernet switch with “lockstep” dual-core Arm processing redundancy. Marvell’s Brightlane automotive portfolio is a set of chips including Ethernet physical layer transceivers bridges and switches.

The new automotive Ethernet switch the 88Q5192 is the third generation of Marvell’s Brightlane Ethernet Switch product line. The company claims that this design iteration as its most secure managed switch device within the Brightlane portfolio thanks to the addition of lockstep dual-core Arm redundancy.

Marvell says its new switch offers a suite of advanced security and networking features that improve the vehicle's performance by establishing processing redundancy higher reliability increased data management and a larger bandwidth. The 88Q5192 integrates IEEE 802.1AE-2018-compliant Media Access Control security (MACsec) protocols and an embedded Hardware Security Module (eHSM) for software authentication and data encryption.

Dual-core Arm Operates in Lockstep

A key feature of the device is its dual-core Arm R52 CPU. The CPU operates in lockstep with dedicated on-chip memory to support Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) protocols like Precision Time Protocol (PTP). A security firewall protects from malicious external attacks. Marvell says this switch is well suited for use in automotive systems such as ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems) zonal control modules body domain controllers and central gateways.

Designers can leverage Marvell’s Brightlane portfolio to implement media dependent interface (MDI) termination resistors into the physical layer of the 4K MAC. This provides error-free transmission over a variety of media to reach distances that exceed 100 meters and will reduce the board component count saving costs.

Marvell’s Ethernet switch is very similar to Broadcom’s latest switch described earlier. Each offer 16-port capability along with 1000BASE-T1 media converters and 100 Mbps of automotive Ethernet data throughput (100BASE-T1). There is a slight advantage to Broadcom since its Ethernet switch can reach a switching capacity of 55 Gb/s. More information can be found in the 88Q5192 product brief.

Automotive Innovation Paves the Road Ahead

Within its segment of the electronics market automotive ICs are an area of continuous innovation. Naturally that means chip vendors will always be jockeying to be the “first” across a variety of types of automotive technologies. The products discussed here are great examples along those lines and engineers are reaping the benefits of these advances.",,,,,,,,,,,,

No this wasn’t my usual one-week test drive of a manufacturer’s new vehicle. Tesla didn’t provide me the bright Pearl White Model S Long Range. A private owner did.

Tesla you see is the Apple of automakers where its own early-adopter cultish clan that by scarcity word of mouth and superiority of intellect chooses its future customers. Ferrari understands.

But marketing aside the trendy Tesla was at my disposal for a couple of days in stinking hot Las Vegas where I estimate a good 10% of cars are now Teslas. Makes sense as Teslas are made just over the border in Freemont California. Plus gas prices have forever been crazy high on the West Coast and pollution is a big concern there too. So going electric holds much appeal.

It really should from a performance standpoint at least to many of us.

If muscle cars or exotics with neck-stretching acceleration are your obsession well electrics should be your new best friend. All are fast because electrics deliver instant torque via direct drive electric motors and single-speed fixed gear transmissions. No lag no waiting for a turbo to kick in. Like your electric razor or hair dryer the electrons flow instantly. Boom there it is!

I have driven other electrics so that part wasn’t new. It was the whole Tesla experience that was different. And let’s get this out of the way now. Whether you like Elon Musk or not Tesla is the top-selling electric car maker.

So how’s a Tesla drive? What are its advantages? And what are Type S’s drawbacks?

Let’s take a look and be forewarned this is not exactly like most of my test drives as it was such a short duration.

First the Type S is a sport luxury sedan in all the ways you picture one in your mind’s eye.

It’s sleek including door handles that fold into the body panels’ sides and pop out when it’s time to open a door. Oh and it’s really a hatchback as the back window and trunk open as one. That surprised me but I loved it.

Mark Savage

Power and handling are pure sports sedans. How so?

Well the dual AC electric motors one powering the front wheels one the rear create (and I’m not making this up) 825 horsepower along with 960 pound-feet of torque. Is that a lot? You bet. Consider that a new rear-engine Chevy Corvette makes 495 horsepower with 470 pound-feet of torque will do 0-60 in 2.9 seconds and has a top speed of 184 mph says Car and Driver. That’s a two-seat sports car but still.

The Type S gets all that power from a 100 kWh lithium-ion battery pack which due to its substantial weight also gives the Tesla a low center of gravity that makes it handle like well a sports luxury sedan. The car feels well planted handles turns with a precision you’d expect and its AWD means that even if you were running it in soggy weather or on slippery streets it’d perform with gusto and confidence.

Ride due to that weight (the car weighs more than 4500 pounds) and a long wheelbase is excellent too. Smooth and silky it’s what I’d call a Buick or Lexus ride but with a more performance-oriented stiffness to make the car feel connected to the road. I must say though that Las Vegas roads are generally so smooth that it’s not like testing a car in the frost-heave capital Wisconsin.

Safety is copiously covered. All the usual blind-spot lane-keeping and parking sensors are here and ready to beep.

Luxury? Well the car starts at roughly $96000 and most are selling for more like $105000 and there’s a waiting list that can stretch many months.

So you’d expect luxury and Tesla delivers. The body on the test car was spotless and the seams were straight and equal. So reports of poor build quality didn’t show here.

Inside the black leather seating was excellent too and the seats were well-formed. They also were heated up front but cooled would make sense for 110-degree Vegas.

Of course everyone talks about its aircraft-style yoke in Tesla’s interior that replaces the age-old steering wheel oh and a gargantuan info screen. It’s overwhelming.

Mark Savage

First that yoke. It takes some getting used to but is easy to master especially for highway driving. Where I noticed it feeling particularly odd was during parking maneuvers or turning a tight corner where one would naturally grab the top of a steering wheel to turn it sharply. Not possible here so spin that power steering yoke with your hand on one side of the yoke or a finger under one of the spokes. That maneuver reminds of early 1960s cars with over-boosted power steering that could be spun with a finger.

Ironically the steering wheel was heated totally unneeded in much of the South and Southwest.

Touchscreen? OK it’s way too much and controls virtually every function known to mankind short of rocket launching but since this is Tesla that’s likely to come.

The navigation system makes you feel like you’re looking at an entire city map so a driver will always want to pinch it to visually zoom in on where they were driving.

Also you can open garage doors call up radio stations ad nauseam use voice command to find apps ask it for directions order lunch etc. Naturally there’s a screen for setting up or observing battery charging (done through the driver’s side taillight). Ironically there is no Android Auto or Apple CarPlay here though.

And get this you engage the single-speed fixed gear automatic transmission via the screen too. Slide your finger UP along its left edge and the car moves forward. Slide your finger down the screen’s left edge and the car moves backward. Weird but I suppose one would get used to it. One also supposes this will soon be the norm for electrics.

Of course there’s a 360-degree camera that looks amazing on the screen and the Tesla stereo is a high-quality number that makes you feel you’re in a concert hall. Heck it’s so quiet in here that it feels like a symphony hall.

Overhead is a giant tinted panoramic sunroof which looks super but really needs a sun shade. Why? Well even though tinted and supposedly deflecting the sun’s rays the roof gets incredibly hot at least in Vegas. How hot? You do NOT want to touch it. It’s painful to touch.

Other interior bugaboos include an extremely wide console that feels somewhat intrusive and sounds hollow if you tap it plus shoulder belts that cannot be adjusted for driver height. That seemed particularly odd as nearly all cars crossovers and SUVs now allow the shoulder harness to be moved up or down a few inches. This one was too high for me so I crossed the left edge of my neck. Not comfy.

In the back the hatch’s cargo area is generous and easily accessed. It’s rated at 25 cubic feet and don’t forget there’s a 3.1 cu.ft. front trunk. Might wanna keep your charging cable there though.

Speaking of electricity a Tesla supercharger will give the vehicle a 200-miles boost in 15 minutes of charging. But most folks will overnight charge at home and that can take most of the night. For efficiency you’ll want a 240-volt garage charger. That ran $500 in Vegas and installation was another $600 or so varying by the electrician.

But a nearly full charge (Tesla recommends 90% to preserve battery life) will get a Type S roughly 400 miles of range plenty for a week’s commute to most downtowns and one of Tesla’s key selling points as it leads the industry in charge range.

Extras are rare. A full self-driving feature (and we’ve all heard the sad tales) costs $10000 extra while stylish Arachnid wheels add $4500. They look cool but cut your driving range by 9% according to reports.

Folks needing more power can move up to the Model S Plaid for $131900. It has three electric motors making a mere 1006 hp.

He believes that the father of the nation would have taken out a march across the country to create awareness.

""That is what I am also trying to do - travel across India tell people about climate change and encourage the use of solar energy"" he says.

Solanki a professor at the Department of Energy Science and Engineering IIT Bombay has been on the road for the past two years travelling across India on a bus for what he calls the Energy Swaraj Yatra 2020-30.

Not going home for 10 years

Often referred to as 'Solar man of India' and 'Solar Gandhi' Prof. Solanki has left academics and his family behind for 10 years to create awareness about climate change and solar energy.



""One or two years are not sufficient to create awareness about the urgent need for action to stop climate change it will need at least a decade. So I decided to travel continuously for ten years till 2030 across India. I made a promise to myself that I won't go back home to meet my family even on festivals"" Solanki told Indiatimes.

Bobins Abraham/ Indiatimes

Office house and more on solar-powered bus

In a bus that has been modified to become his house and office Solanki then set out on his Energy Swaraj yatra.



The modified bus has an AC bedroom office space a kitchen with an induction cooker and refrigerator and a training room all powered by eight solar panels installed on the mobile house's roof.

A volunteer from the Energy Swaraj Foundation the bus driver and his assistant are also traveling on the bus with Solanki.

Bobins Abraham/ Indiatimes

Fist leg to be completed in November

""The idea behind the bus was that I should have a place where I can comfortably eat sleep and live. I designed the bus myself so that I will be comfortable throughout the journey"" he said.



The first leg of the journey touching all states and union territories will conclude in November nearly two years after he set out from Bhopal in November 2020.



Energy Swaraj Foundation

In every new city and state Solanki visits he makes it a point to display the bus his Energy Swaraj bus at prominent locations for people to see for themselves that solar power is reliable and can be used to power their houses.

From a MP village to solar man of India

Hailing from Barwani District in Madhya Pradesh Solakni did his master's from IIT-Bombay and worked in chip designing for Texas Instruments in Bengaluru before realising that working on solar energy is what he wanted to do.

Bobins Abraham/ Indiatimes

Using science for the society

After completing his Ph.D. in solar from Europe and returned to India in 2004 and started teaching at IIT Bombay but soon he ralised that it was not the set of people whose lives he wanted to change.

""In 2010 I started a school in rural MP to provide quality education for the children there. The school was entirely powered by solar. This was also the time when the government was trying to promote solar energy by offering subsidies. I thought instead of providing subsidies why not train some rural people in making solar devices? So I took an unpaid leave of six months and went to the villages and taught them in putting together solar lanterns. In the six months they produced around 21000 solar lanterns"" Solanki said.

After tasting initial success Solanki set an ambitious target of providing one million solar lanterns to students within a year which he ended up doing in 11 months.

Bobins Abraham/ Indiatimes

Since he started travelling Solanki has given more than 600 talks about climate change and solar energy to a wide range of populations from students to techies and people who come to him seeing the bus on the road.

Stop subsidising solar

Interestingly he feels that if the government wants to promote solar energy it should stop providing subsidies for it.

""Solar power has been around for the past 50 years. All the subsidies are actually holding it back. Because people feel guilty of using solar energy and not getting subsidy for it"" he said.

To investigate the role of Yap1 and Taz (Wwtr1) in aging HSPCs we analyzed their expression in LK (Linneg Sca-1neg c-Kitpos) and LSK (Linneg Sca-1pos c-Kitpos) cells from young and old mice (for exemplary flow cytometry profiles see Supplementary Fig. 1). Wwtr1 mRNA as well as the Taz Protein were both strikingly induced in old LSK (oLSK) whereas Yap1 expression remained unchanged (Fig. 1a–c).

Fig. 1: TAZ (Wwtr1) is strongly induced in oLT-HSCs. a Representative flow cytometry plots of LK (Lineageneg Sca-1neg c-Kitpos) and LSK (Lineageneg Sca-1pos c-Kitpos) cells of young and old mice. b qRT-PCRs of Wwtr1 and Yap1 expression in LK and LSK isolated from young and old mice (n = 4 per age group one-way ANOVA with Tukey HSD post hoc test). c Immunoblot analysis of TAZ in LK and LSK of young and old mice. d Representative flow cytometry plots of LT-HSCs ST-HSCs and MPP in the LSK compartment of young and old mice. e Overview of the samples that were analyzed by RNA-Seq (n = 3 per group). f Principal component analysis of the RNA-Seq of the indicated populations (n = 3 per group). g Summary of gene expression changes (old vs. young) of Hippo pathway core components. h Volcano plot encompassing all transcriptional regulators (KEGG database) that were analyzed in the LT-HSC dataset old vs. young.

To analyze gene expression changes in the LSK compartment in greater detail we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) from long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs: LSK CD34neg CD135neg) short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs: LSK CD34pos CD135neg) and multipotent progenitors (MPPs: LSK CD34pos CD135pos) from young and old mice (Fig. 1d e). As expected the number of immunophenotypic LT-HSCs was strongly increased in old mice (Supplementary Fig. 2a).

ST-HSCs and MPPs showed a weaker age-dependent separation in principal component analyses whereas old LT-HSCs (oLT-HSCs) were more clearly separable from young LT-HSCs (yLT-HSCs) and showed the highest number of differentially expressed genes between old and young (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 2b). Although most Hippo core components showed only weak or no age-dependent changes Wwtr1 was strongly increased specifically in LT-HSCs and old human HSPCs (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 2c). Yap1 on the other hand was barely expressed in LT-HSCs demonstrating that Wwtr1 is the predominant transcriptional Hippo effector in these cells (Supplementary Fig. 2d).

Strikingly Wwtr1 was the most potently induced transcriptional regulator when comparing oLT-HSCs vs. yLT-HSCs (Fig. 1h).

To identify TAZ-dependent target genes in HSPCs we lentivirally overexpressed the constitutively active TAZ S89A point mutant in freshly isolated LSKs and subsequently performed RNA-Seq (Fig. 1i j). A TAZ-induced gene set consisting of 169 genes was then used to probe TAZ activity in HSCs (Fig. 1k and Supplementary Table 1). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrated that Taz-induced genes were upregulated in oLT-HSCs compared to oST-HSCs and in oLT-HSCs compared to yLT-HSCs (Fig. 1k). These results show that Taz is active in oLT-HSCs and contributes to aging-dependent gene expression changes.

Clca3a1 is induced by Taz and marks oLT-HSCs

To filter for TAZ-induced genes specific of oLT-HSCs we intersected the Taz overexpression RNA-Seq performed in LSKs with the previous RNA-Seq of young and old HSPCs (Fig. 2a). We obtained a relatively concise set of 24 genes that is also strongly induced in independent datasets (Supplementary Fig. 3a) which we refer to as aged LT-HSC-Taz signature (aLT-Taz signature). In the aLT-Taz signature Calcium-activated chloride channel regulator 1 (Clca3a1) coding an accessory protein for calcium-activated chloride channels demonstrated one of the most striking aging-dependent change in LT-HSCs (Fig. 2b). Clca3a1 expression just like the TAZ target gene Amotl2 strictly followed Wwtr1 expression in the different HSPC populations suggesting that CLCA3A1 may be used to trace TAZ activity in vivo (Fig. 2c). Remarkably Wwtr1 Amotl2 and Clca3a1 were all part of an aging HSC (aHSC) signature (Supplementary Table 1) generated by a meta-analysis of sixteen transcriptomic datasets of aged HSCs17 underlining the robustness of our results.

CLCA3A1 was barely detectable by flow cytometry in young LSK populations but specifically induced in old LT-HSCs (Fig. 2d e and Supplementary Fig. 1). CLCA3A1low HSCs purified from old animals were less quiescent than yHSCs. It took them significantly shorter to complete their first cell division in vitro18 (Fig. 2f) a typical phenotype of oHSCs19. CLCA3A1low cells demonstrated a significantly higher Ki67 positivity potentially because they showed a ~3x higher Cdk6 expression and thus were more Cdk6-dependent for cell division (Supplementary Fig. 3b–e).

RNA-Seq analysis of sorted CLCA3A1high and CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs (Fig. 2g) identified a high number of DEGs: 1169 upregulated (FDR < 0.01) and 1489 downregulated (FDR < 0.01) in CLCA3A1high vs CLCA3A1low.

Notably the aLT-Taz signature was significantly upregulated (p = 1.2e−7) in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs (Fig. 2g) showing that CLCA3A1 is a proxy for TAZ activity.

To analyze the relative contribution of the aging-dependent increase in the frequency of CLCA3A1high cells to the overall transcriptome changes during HSCs aging we compared the CLCA3A1 RNA-Seq with the old vs. young LT-HSCs RNA-Seq (Fig. 2g). Strikingly the vast majority of genes that were upregulated in CLCA3A1high cells were also upregulated in old vs. young LT-HSCs not only in our data but also in an independent RNA-Seq study7 comparing old and young LT-HSCs (Supplementary Fig. 3f). The same was true for the downregulated genes. Thus the up- and downregulated genes in CLCA3A1high cells significantly overlap with the genes up- and downregulated in oLT-HSCs (Fig. 2h). When Clca3a1 is knocked out in yHSCs in vivo20 Clca3a1 seemed to be required to maintain the HSC pool suggesting that this TAZ-induced gene also has a function in young HSCs (Supplementary Fig. 4). However we focus here on the upstream coactivator Taz because it regulates a variety of different genes that can affect the ageing phenotype.

CLCA3A1high/TAZhigh HSCs mark a specific oHSC subpopulation

To investigate the heterogeneity of Taz-dependent transcription programs in HSPCs at the single-cell level independently of any surface marker we analyzed the transcriptome of young LSK (yLSK) and oLSK by Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-Seq)21. We labeled LSKs with antibody-derived tags (ADTs) for the SLAM marker panel CD150 and CD48 as well as CLCA3A1 to validate our findings with an independent set of HSC surface markers. Based on the activity of specific gene sets (Supplementary Table 1) we were able to identify individual cells with different activities for LT-HSCs ST-HSCs and MPPs (Fig. 2i).

Graph-based clustering identified six clusters (clusters 0–5) in the single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) dataset from young and old LSK cells (Fig. 2j). With the help of the SLAM ADTs and gene set activities22 we identified cluster 1 as a cluster enriched for LT-HSC (Fig. 2j–m and Supplementary Fig. 3g h). Since functional studies would be required to demonstrate their functionality as LT-HSCs we refer to this cluster as ‘HSC-like cluster’. It contained cells expressing high Taz on mRNA level (Fig. 2k) high CLCA3A1 on protein level (Fig. 2l) and showing high activity for a CLCA3A1high gene set (Fig. 2m). CLCA3A1high were much more abundant in the aged population (Fig. 2k l) within the HSC-like cluster’. Only very few scattered yLSKs demonstrated high CLCA3A1 protein level or a high Clca3a1 gene set activity (Fig. 2l m and Supplementary Fig. 3i) suggesting that CLCA3A1high cells also exist to a minor extent in young animals. TAZ activity just like CLCA3A1 activity was largely limited to the HSC-like cluster and was strongly induced in old cells within this cluster (Fig. 2n).

The CLCA3A1high gene set activity strongly correlated with the activity of two independent LT-HSC-specific gene sets (Fig. 2o) one based on our own RNA-Seq data and one previously published23.

In summary CLCA3A1high/TAZhigh HSCs represent a specific and highly abundant population within the oHSC compartment. They are characterized by high expression of genes that qualify them as LT-HSCs but are transcriptionally distinct from yHSCs.

Old CLCA3A1low HSCs show features of “young-like” HSCs

To test whether the surface marker CLCA3A1 is sufficient to isolate a pure fraction of oHSCs and “young-like” HSCs from old mice we compared our CLCA3A1high signature with the aHSC signature. Both signatures nearly perfectly correlated at the single-cell level indicating that CLCA3A1 is an excellent marker to isolate oHSCs (Fig. 3a b). Remarkably a substantial number of old cells with low CLCA3A1high gene set activity were present in the HSC-like cluster (Fig. 3c) suggesting that a CLCA3A1low immunophenotype marks individual “young-like” HSCs within the pool of oHSCs.

Fig. 3: CLCA3A1high HSCs demonstrate features of aged HSCs. a UMAP plots for CITE-Seq data of young and old LSKs. The activity of the aged HSC (aHSC) signature is colored based on the gene set activity. b Scatter plots of CLCA3A1high gene set activity plotted against the activity of an HSC aging signature from the CITE-Seq dataset (R = Pearson correlation coefficient linear regression t-test). c Violin plots of CLCA3A1high (left) and aHSC (right) gene set activity in clusters 0 and 1 from the CITE-Seq (two-sided Wilcox test). d Heatmap of Z-score normalized expression values for a gene set for myeloid-biased LT-HSCs (MyLT-HSCs) (n = 3 per group). e Representative flow cytometry plots for CD150 and CLCA3A1 of oHSCs. The CD150 signal was divided into three different windows (left) and the CLCA3A1 signal was plotted for each window (right). The numbers give the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) ± 95% confidence interval (one-way ANOVA with Tukey HSD post hoc test). f Leukocyte chimerism in the PB over time after competitive transplantation of CLCA3A1high or CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs (n = 10 for CLCA3A1low n = 9 for CLCA3A1high two independent transplantations two-way ANOVA with Tukey HSD post hoc test). g Percentage of myeloid (CD11bpos) B (B220pos) and T cells (CD4pos or CD8pos) from the donor (CD45.2pos) after competitive transplantation of CLCA3A1high or CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs (n = 10 for CLCA3A1low n = 9 for CLCA3A1high two independent transplantations two-way ANOVA with Tukey HSD post hoc test). Data in f g are presented as mean values +/− SEM. Source data are provided as a Source data file. Full size image

In accordance with the aged phenotype of CLCA3A1high HSCs CLCA3A1 induction also correlated with a gene expression profile of myeloid-biased LT-HSCs (MyLT-HSCs)24 at the single-cell level (Supplementary Fig. 5a) and in the bulk RNA-Seq dataset (Fig. 3d). Consistently Clca3a1 expression clearly correlated with the expression of CD150 a marker of MyLT-HSC in flow cytometry analyses (Fig. 3e).

Given the fundamental differences between CLCA3A1low and CLCA3A1high HSCs at multiple levels we next tested whether these two cell populations also differ functionally. To this end we analyzed their long-term repopulating capacity and their long-term multilineage reconstitution potential in competitive repopulation assays. Two expected hallmarks of oLT-HSCs in this assay are functional decline in long-term repopulation and myeloid skewing of peripheral blood (PB) cells. We transplanted CD45.2-expressing CLCA3A1high or CLCA3A1ow LT-HSCs together with CD45.1/2 competitor cells into lethally irradiated CD45.1 (Ly5.1) recipient mice. PB chimerism was investigated monthly over a period of 4 months. One month post-transplantation chimerism in the blood of CLCA3A1high recipients was comparable to those who received CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs (Fig. 3f). Over time however recipients of CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs showed a gradual decline of donor contribution to the PB (Fig. 3f g) demonstrating a defect in long-term repopulating activity of the CLCA3A1high population. The frequency of CLCA3A1low-derived leukocytes in contrast remained stable compared to the young and age-matched competitor cells (Fig. 3f). In addition CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs produced significantly more myeloid cells in the PB and fewer B and T cells (Fig. 3g). Four months after transplantation spleen and bone marrow (BM) chimerism appeared strongly decreased in recipients receiving CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs (Supplementary Fig. 5b c). Within the donor-derived compartment Clca3a1high- and CLCA3A1low-derived cells generated a similar frequency of myeloid progenitors but the CLCA3A1low samples showed a higher frequency of common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs)—a typical characteristic of yHSCs3 (Supplementary Fig. 5d). Irrespective of the donor status (CLCA3A1high or CLCA3A1low) CLCA3A1 expression was lost in the BM 4 months after transplantation and the two different cell populations showed similar behavior in secondary transplantations.

Old HSCs induce Taz to keep a minimal regenerative potential

Next we tested whether Taz actively contributes to the functional decline of CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs or whether it gets induced to counteract defects in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs. Intriguingly Clusterin (gene name Clu) was potently induced in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Previous studies showed that Clu expression is YAP1-dependent and is induced in stressed cells to trigger a regenerative response25. To test whether TAZ has a similar function in oHSCs we depleted TAZ in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs using two potent shRNAs (shTAZ#1 and shTAZ#2) shTAZ#2 being more potent than shTAZ#1 and a control shRNA (shRen) targeting Renilla (Fig. 4a). We isolated CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs infected them ex vivo with lentiviral shRNA constructs and transplanted these cells into lethally irradiated recipients. Transplanted CLCA3A1high populations contained ~60–80% infected (GFP-positive) and ~20–40% uninfected (GFP-negative) cells in order to use the GFP-negative fraction as a competitor against the GFP-positive fraction from the same donor and follow the frequency of GFP-positive cells within the CD45.2 donor fraction over time (Supplementary Fig. 6b). In the PB shTAZ-transduced donor cells rapidly lost the GFP signal demonstrating that uninfected cells outcompeted TAZ-depleted cells whereas shRen cells maintained a stable frequency of GFP-positive cells (Fig. 4b).

TAZ-depleted HSCs showed a tendency to produce increased numbers of myeloid cells and decreased numbers of B and T cells (Supplementary Fig. 6c). The effects appeared subtler when compared to those observed for competitive repopulation although both Taz shRNAs showed similar trends. The inferior fitness of shTAZ progeny was also reflected in the BM where TAZ depletion led to a significantly reduced GFPpos fraction in lineage-negative (Linneg) precursor cells (Fig. 4c). The percentage of CD34neg LSK cells in the GFP-positive compartment however remained largely unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 6d) indicating that HSCs were not lost due to Taz depletion. The RNA-Seq analysis of donor-derived LSK CD34neg cells 4 months after transplantation revealed that TAZ-depleted cells were transcriptionally distinct from shRen cells (Fig. 4d e) and that TAZ depletion led to a downregulation of the top 200 genes that were induced in old LT-HSCs (Fig. 4f). These transcriptional profiling analyses in conjunction with our transplantation studies of TAZ-depleted HSCs demonstrate that TAZ sustains a transcriptional program that protects aged HSCs from functional decline.

Clca3a1low HSCs resemble yHSCs at the chromatin level

Given the fundamental changes that occur at the epigenomic level in oHSCs7 we analyzed the chromatin changes in CLCA3A1high and CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs. To this end we profiled the global chromatin accessibility of these cells as well as yHSCs and oHSCs by FAST-ATAC-Seq (Fig. 5a b)26.

Fig. 5: CLCA3A1low HSCs resemble yHSCs on chromatin level. a Heatmaps for FAST-ATAC data of CLCA3A1high CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs oHSCs and yHSCs (n = 3 for CLCA3A1low CLCA3A1high and HSC old; n = 6 for HSC young).

We identified 43031 peaks that were shared between all four samples (Fig. 5b). Strikingly CLCA3A1high HSCs and oHSCs demonstrated many additional peaks of these 22023 were shared between these two samples. The functional GO term analysis of those additional peaks demonstrated a clear enrichment for pathways involved in direct or indirect regulation of TAZ e.g. Hippo and Wnt signaling pathways (Fig. 5c)27. Also the Wwtr1 locus itself showed changes in chromatin accessibility specifically in candidate enhancer regions which are hypomethylated in oHSCs7 (Supplementary Fig. 7). Differential peak analysis of CLCA3A1high vs. CLCA3A1low HSCs corroborated the trend toward more peaks in CLCA3A1high HSCs (Fig. 5d–f). Increased accessibility also led to greater expression of the associated genes at the mRNA level (Fig. 5e f) which shows that chromatin changes can impact on gene expression.

To identify changes in TF accessibility indicative of altered TF activity which could explain the functional differences we performed a chromVAR analysis28. In accordance with our transcriptomic profiling of CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs and yLT-HSCs CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs clustered together with yLT-HSCs whereas CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs clustered with oLT-HSCs (Fig. 5g h). Furthermore the accessibility of the TEAD motifs was much higher in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs than in yLT-HSCs indicating that TEAD/TAZ is more active in these cells (Fig. 5i).

Collectively our data demonstrate that old CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs have lower TEAD/TAZ activity than CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs and resemble yLT-HSCs at the transcriptional chromatin and functional level.

Low PU.1 expression is associated with aging phenotypes

To understand chromatin accessibility changes in aging HSCs at the single-cell level we performed single-cell ATAC-Seq (scATAC-Seq) of young and old LT HSCs and of CLCA3A1high and CLCA3A1low LT HSCs (Fig. 6a d). Analysis of differentially accessible TF motifs showed a striking correlation when comparing changes in old vs. young and CLCA3A1high vs. CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs (Fig. 6g). Here DNA sequences bound by ETS transcription factors (SPI1 and SPIC) were identified as the most differentially accessible sites in both comparisons as well in our bulk ATAC-Seq data (Fig. 6g and Supplementary Fig. 8a b). While the accessibility of Spi1 motifs progressively decreased from young to old and from CLCA3A1low to CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs the accessibility of a Tead motif showed an opposite behavior when we analyzed the behavior of these motifs in pseudotime analyses (Fig. 6h i). oLT-HSCs are thus a heterogeneous pool of cells where opposed activities of PU.1 and TEAD/TAZ define functionally distinct populations which can be separated based on CLCA3A1. Remarkably Spi1 encodes the transcription factor PU.1 a key regulator of HSC function29 suggesting that the activity of this critical regulator is decreased during HSC aging. Consistently Spi1 expression demonstrated a sharp drop specifically in the HSC-like cluster 1 but not the adjacent cluster 0 in our scRNA-Seq data (Fig. 6j). To investigate whether decreased Spi1 expression in CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs also affects PU.1 target gene expression we generated PU.1-dependent gene sets from hematopoietic progenitor cells. For that we depleted PU.1 in the HSC-like cell line BM-HPC#530 using two potent shRNAs and performed RNA-Seq (Fig. 6k l). We identified 667 genes which were downregulated (log2FC < (−1) padj<0.05: shPU1.down) and 899 genes that were upregulated (log2FC > 1 padj < 0.05: shPU1.up) upon PU.1 depletion (Fig. 6l). Consistent with low PU.1 expression in CLCA3A1high HSCs HSC-like cluster 1 contained significantly more cells with high shPU1.up AUC from old vs young a trend which could not be observed in the adjacent cluster 0 (Fig. 6m). Furthermore the shPU1.up gene set was significantly upregulated when comparing CLCA3A1high vs. CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs while the shPU1.down gene set showed opposite regulation (Fig. 6n). We noticed that many genes encoding surface markers commonly used to isolate HSCs (Cd34 Flt3 (CD135) Cd48 Procr (EPCR)) were affected by PU.1 depletion in BM-HPC#5 and were also downregulated in CLCA3A1high vs. CLCA3A1low LT-HSCs (Fig. 6l o). Low Spi1 expression in oHSCs could hence explain the increased frequency of immunophenotypic HSCs commonly observed in aged individuals. We confirmed this by flow cytometry comparing young and old LSK since the frequency of immunophenotypic LT-HSCs in old Clca3a1low LSK resembled that of yLSK cells (Fig. 6p q).

These data demonstrate that HSC aging is associated with a gradual depletion of PU.1 which correlates with specific features of oHSCs at the transcriptional and immunophenotypic level.

Decreased Spi1 expression in yHSC drives features of aging

To test whether decreased PU.1 levels in yHSCs is sufficient to induce an “old-like” HSC phenotype we depleted PU.1 in yHSCs from 14- to 17-week-old by two independent shRNAs. We analyzed the PB and BM only 2 months after transplantation as PU.1-deficient HSCs are lost shortly after transplantation31. PU.1-depleted HSCs rapidly lost their ability to contribute to the production of PB cells but had mostly weaker effects on other parameters in BM and PB (Supplementary Fig. 9a–d). Due to the critical role of PU.1 in progenitors downstream of the HSC compartment we consequently focused on PU.1’s role in HSCs. Therefore we performed scRNA-Seq of the LSK compartment from control- (shRen) and PU.1-depleted (shPU1 #1 and shPU1 #2) HSPCs 2 months after transplantation (Fig. 7a–d Supplementary Fig. 9e). Graph-based clustering revealed seven clusters (Fig. 7a). We used a previously defined stringent HSC vs. MPP1 gene set23 (LT-HSC #2 Fig. 2i) to identify “HSC-like cells” in our scRNA-Seq data. In this way we identified two populations consisting mainly of HSC-like cells (Fig. 7b). One population located in clusters 2 and 5 contained almost exclusively PU.1-depleted HSC-like cells while shRen HSC-like cells were mainly found in cluster 0 (Fig. 7c d). Just as in BM-HPC#5 cells PU.1 depletion in young HSC-like cells resulted in drastic gene expression changes with Cd34 as well as Flt3 being potently downregulated (Fig. 7e). Consistent with the previously described role of PU.1 in maintaining HSC quiescence genes induced after PU.1 depletion in HSC-like cells showed highly significant enrichment for E2F-dependent target genes (Supplementary Fig. 9f g). Noteworthy Taz mRNA was undetectable in the scRNA-Seq dataset suggesting that PU.1 depletion alone does not lead to Taz induction. The shPU1.up gene set showed high activity exclusively in clusters 2 and 5 which contained shPU1 HSC-like cells (Fig. 7f). Strikingly PU.1 depletion alone was sufficient to induce an “aged-like” transcriptome in young HSC-like cells without inducing a myeloid-biased LT-HSC gene expression program (Fig. 7g h) suggesting that decreased PU.1 expression in oHSCs does not contribute to this phenotype or that it takes longer to establish. However the aHSC gene set showed high activity specifically in PU.1-depleted HSC-like cells with low PU.1 activity—equivalent to high sh.PU1.up activity (Fig. 7i).

Given the partially overlapping phenotype that depletion of TAZ and PU.1 had on the regenerative potential of HSCs and their opposite activities in our scATAC analyses we hypothesized that Taz is induced during aging to compensate for the decreased PU.1 expression in oHSCs—possibly because TAZ can act as a coactivator for PU.1. Consistent with this hypothesis PU.1 and TAZ depletion showed a convergent transcriptional response upon depletion (Fig. 7j). Moreover PU.1 and TAZ physically interacted in GST pulldown assays and TAZ was able to act as a potent PU.1 coactivator in transient luciferase reporter assays in a strictly PU.1-dependent manner (Fig. 7k l). Since we were not able to obtain high-quality genomic binding data for PU.1 or TAZ from freshly sorted HSCs we performed Cut&Run for PU.1 in BM-HPC#5 cells to identify genes that are directly regulated by PU.1. The 3163 PU.1 Cut&Run peaks were highly enriched for ETS-motifs and were almost exclusively located in promoter regions (Fig. 7m–p). To identify direct PU.1 target genes that are induced in a TAZ-dependent manner we intersected the PU.1 peaks with the genes that are significantly downregulated in transplanted old CLCA3A1high LT-HSCs (Fig. 4e) upon TAZ depletion (Fig. 7q). We identified here 60 genes that were potently downregulated (with a median log2 fold change of −4.8) upon TAZ depletion (Supplementary Table 1). Here the two gene ontology terms centrosome and microtubule organization which play a critical role in mitosis and symmetric vs. asymmetric cell division were highly enriched in these 60 genes (Fig. 7r). Thus our data show that age-dependent loss of PU.1 activity in HSCs is sufficient to induce aging phenotypes and that Taz can counteract them at least in part by acting as a PU.1 coactivator for specific genes (Fig. 7s t).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMi0xOTQwNy140gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delivery and assessment of a CRISPR/nCas9-based genome editing system on in vitro models of ...,"Synthesis of cell-penetrating bioconjugates and liposomes

Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were prepared by a chemical coprecipitation of FeCl 2 and FeCl 3 (2:1 molar ratio) as described previously31. A silver shell was then formed on the surface of MNPs by a redox reaction in the presence of Ag ions. A solution containing 2 mg/mL MNPs and 1 mM AgNO 3 was stirred (500 rpm) for 10 min. An equivalent volume of honey solution was subsequently added and stirred for (500 rpm) 10 min. Finally the reduction of Ag+ ions was initiated by increasing pH to 8.5 with 5 M NaOH added dropwise. The solution was stirred (500 rpm) at room temperature for one hour.

A Hofmann elimination reaction achieved the conjugation of the pH-responsive polymer poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (pDMAEMA Sigma-Aldrich USA). For this 2 mg/mL of the core–shell MNPs:Ag were sonicated and then 1 mM HCl was added until the pH decreased to 3. MNPs were dispersed in type I water (50 mL 2 mg/mL) and pDMAEMA (10 mL 2 mg/mL) was slowly added resulting in MNPs:Ag-pDMAEMA. Later they were functionalized with 3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES Sigma-Aldrich USA) followed by conjugation of amino PEG12 propionic acid (PEG12 Sigma-Aldrich USA). Finally Buforin II was immobilized on the resulting MNPs:Ag-pDMAEMA/PEG12 conjugates to form the MNPs:Ag-pDMAEMA/PEG12-BUF-II nanobioconjugates hereafter called MNPs@Ag-pD/BUF-II. Additional details can be consulted elsewhere31.

Liposomes were synthesized by the lipid bilayer hydration method72. In brief soy lecithin was dissolved in chloroform (10 mg/mL). The solution was evaporated in a rotary evaporator (Hei-VAP Core Heidolph Germany) under vacuum at 45 °C for one hour. The film was hydrated with PBS (1X) in the rotary evaporator at 55 °C for one hour. Finally the solution was filtered (0.22 μm) and stored at 4 °C until further use.

Physical characterization of nanobioconjugates

Hydrodynamic size and Z-potential were measured by using dynamic light scattering (DLS) in a Zeta-Sizer Nano-ZS (Malvern Panalytical Malvern UK) according to our previous protocols31. For loading DNA capacity we used the AIO-mCherry plasmid (Addgene: #74120). DNA loading was calculated as reported by Ramirez et al.31 and defined as the maximum amount of plasmid DNA loaded per μg of MNPs@Ag-pD/BUF-II. Briefly 250 μg of MNPs@Ag-pD/BUF-II were incubated with plasmid DNA ranging between 0 and 3000 ng.

Protection against DpnI digestion

For the DpnI assay we used one plasmid CRISPR/nCas9 (pDNA) containing two sgRNA engineered in the AAVS1 locus11. Initially 28 µg MNPs@Ag-pD/BUF-II suspended in 30 µL PBS 1X pH 8.0 were precipitated using a magnetic field aided by a PureProteome Magnetic Stands (Merck Millipore USA) for 10 min. The supernatant was gently removed and 1 µg of plasmid previously diluted in Cut Smart buffer 1X (CSB New England Biolabs USA) was mixed with the precipitated MNPs@Ag-pD/BUF-II. The solution was vigorously mixed by pipetting up and down and it was incubated for 10 min at RT/130 rpm. Later MNPs@Ag-pD/BUF-II:pDNA complexes were either left alone or mixed with 0.1 mg/mL liposomes dissolved in CSB at a 1:1 ratio. An additional incubation for 10 min was carried out at room temperature and 20 rpm to obtain MLPs. Finally the MLPs carrying out the plasmids were incubated with 20U DpnI for 30 min at 37 °C according to previous reports7374. Uncoupled pDNA (naked) as well as untreated one were included as controls.

The samples were submitted at 80 °C for 10 min. Later 80 µL phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol 25:24:1 were added and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. After centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 5 min ~ 20µL aqueous phase was loaded on agarose gel 1% p/v stained with 0.5 μg/mL ethidium bromide and run at 100 V for 1 h.

Mammalian cell culture

GM00593 GM01361 GM00958 and GM01259 fibroblasts were purchased from the Coriell Institute repository (New Jersey USA). Specific characteristics of each cell are registered in Supplementary Table 1. Wild-type fibroblasts were isolated from apparently healthy men through informed consent. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM Biowest; USA) supplemented with not inactivated 15% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS Biowest; USA) 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (Gibco USA). The assays were carried out using cells in passages between 3 and 7. All the experiments were approved by the Research and Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Science at Pontificia Universidad Javeriana (Minutes 06 2018).

CRISPR/nCas9 and donor AAVS1:GALNS plasmids

We used a recently validated CRISPR/nCas9 system for this study which allows the efficient homologous recombination of an expression cassette containing a functional version of the human GALNS gene11. Briefly two sgRNA were engineered to address nCas9 at the adeno-associated virus integration site (AAVS1) locus (NCBI Accession: S51329.1) and later cloned into AIO-mCherry plasmid (Addgene: #74120) which carries the CRISPR/nCas9 system using the golden gate strategy as described previously17. No detectable sequence changes on the Top 10 Off-targets were identified by Sanger sequencing11. Donor AAVS1:GALNS contains an encoding wild-type sequence of the human GALNS gene (NCBI Accession: NM_000512) (Supplementary Fig. 1). We encourage readers to review Leal & Alméciga 2022 for details11.

Cytotoxic effect

To determine the cytotoxic effect of liposomes and MNPs@Ag-pD/BUF-II we performed two screenings using both MTT (3-(45-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-25-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; Sigma-Aldrich USA) and an LDH Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (Lactate dehydrogenase release Roche Germany). Briefly 10000 cells/well were seeded on 96-wells plates (TPP; Switzerland) 24 h before assays. Liposomes or MNPs@Ag-pD/BUF-II were incubated with the cells in concentrations ranging from 30 to 500 μg/mL and 12.5–100 μg/mL respectively for 48 h. The plates were read in a microplate reader (Biochrom Anthos 2020 UK) at 562/630 nm and 490/630 nm for MTT and LDH respectively.

The results showed no observable cytotoxic effects at 0.1 mg/mL liposomes and 50 μg/mL MNPs@Ag-pD/BUF-II (data not shown). Moreover to evaluate the potential synergic cytotoxic effect of the MLPs we performed the same screening by using 25 μg/mL/0.05 mg/mL MNPs@Ag-pD/BUF-II:liposome ratio. The cells were also visualized under Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) with an Axio Observer Z1 microscope (ZEISS Birkerød Denmark) to identify morphology changes after treatment. The images were analyzed with the ImageJ software75.

Apoptosis assay

To evaluate whether the MLPs have a proapoptotic effect we used Alexa Fluor 488 Annexin/Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific USA). Briefly 30000 cells/well were grown on 12-well plates (TPP Switzerland) for 24 h. Next the MLPs 25 μg/mL/0.05 mg/mL nanobioconjugate/liposome ratio were added to each well and the cells were incubated for 48 h. After the incubation the cells were harvested by trypsinization washed twice with warmed phosphate buffer saline 1X (PBS 1X) and incubated with Annexin V and Propidium Iodide (PI) for 5 min at room temperature. Finally the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry in a BD FACSAria III Cell Sorter. At least 50000 events were registered on each assay and the data were analyzed with the FlowJo software. As a positive control we used fibroblasts incubated with doxorubicin 2.5 μM by 72 h as reported previously76. Phosphatidylserine externalization was used as a marker for early apoptosis by attaching Annexin V-Alexa Fluor 488 (Ex/Em: 488/530 nm) while necrotic cells were identified with PI (Ex/Em: 488/695 nm) staining. Double positive cells (Annexin+/PI+) were considered late apoptotic cells.

Internalization assay

30000 cells/well PolyD-Lysine-treated coverslip seeded in 12-well plates (TPP; Switzerland) were incubated with MLPs containing Rhodamine-labeled MNPs@Ag-pD/BUF-II (Rho-MLPs) at 4 °C and 37 °C for 4 h. Later the media culture was removed and the cells were washed twice with cold PBS 1X and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Three additional washes were performed with 1X PBS. The coverslips were put on slides containing a fluoroshield mounting medium with DAPI (Abcam; UK). The cells were observed with an Axio Observer Z1 microscope (ZEISS Birkerød Denmark) with a Filter set 109 HE LED (E) containing beam splitter TBS 405 + 575 and an emission filter TBP 425/29 + 632/100; this configuration collected DAPI and Rhodamine respectively. Images were processed with the ImageJ software75.

Transfection assisted by lipofectamine

We used Lipofectamine 3000 (LP Thermo Fisher Scientific USA) as a standard transfection method following previously standardized protocol11. Briefly 30000 cells/well were transfected with 1 µg pDNA (0.5 µg pDNA CRISPR/nCas9 and/or 0.5 µg pDNA Donor AAVS1:GALNS) for 24 h in 12-well plates (TPP Switzerland). After the incubation the culture media was replenished by fresh one.

Transfection assisted by magnetoliposomes

As for the LP experiments 30000 cells/well were used in experiments with magnetoliposomes. CRISPR/nCas9 and/or Donor AAVS1:GALNS plasmids were complexed to NP as reported previously31. A total of 25 µg of MNPs@Ag-pD/BUF-II were used for all the experiments containing up to 0.88 µg pDNA (~ 0.44 µg pDNA CRISPR/nCas9 and/or ~ 0.44 µg pDNA Donor AAVS1:GALNS). pDNA coupling and MLPs synthesis were performed as described for the DpnI assay. Finally the MLPs carrying out the plasmids were added dropwise to each well for 4 h at 37 °C/5%CO 2 . At that point the culture media was removed and replenished by fresh one. All the experiments regarding genome editing (LP and MLPs) were completed on cells treated for 1 month to determine the long-term impact of the edition on MPS IVA fibroblasts. Wild-type fibroblasts were used as normal control. Naked DNA was included as a control in all the experiments with a non-significant effect on any determination (data not shown).

RT-qPCR

One-month post-transfection with LP or MLPs the fibroblasts underwent RNA isolation using a Monarch Total RNA Miniprep Kit (New England Biolabs; USA). RNA quality was checked by running an agarose gel under denaturing conditions and quantified by NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific USA). 0.5 µg of total RNA was retrotranscribed through High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems; USA). The resulting cDNA was used to run an absolute quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) to determine the expression of GALNS by using the TaqMan probe Hs00975732_m1-FAM (Applied Biosystem; USA). A standard curve using Donor AAVS1:GALNS was performed to determine the number of copies/µL.

GALNS enzyme assay

Total protein from fibroblasts was extracted using deoxycholate 1% plus phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 1 mM (PMSF Sigma-Aldrich USA). The protein concentration was determined using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific USA). The GALNS enzyme assay was conducted as described by Leal and Alméciga11. Briefly 10 µL of protein were mixed with 20 µL/2 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-galactopyranoside-6-sulfate (4-MU-Gal-6S Toronto Chemicals Research North York ON Canada) during 17 h at 37 °C. Later 2 µL of β-galactosidase (10 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich USA) was added to the reaction for 4 h. Next 150 µL of glycine-carbonate pH 9.8 were used to stop the reaction. The samples were transferred to a 96-wells black flat-bottom (Corning USA) and read in a fluorometer Twinkle LB970 (Ex/Em: 365/450 nm; Berthold Technologies). To determine the fluorescence of 1 nmol a standard curve of 4-methylumbelliferone (Sigma-Aldrich; USA). Specific GALNS activity was expressed as U/mg of total protein.

Glycosaminoglycans quantification

Total GAGs were determined on extracellular media as described recently11. One-week post-treatment 300 µL of supernatant were collected every 4 days and stored at − 20 °C for up to one month. At that time an aliquot of 50 µL were incubated with 275 µL of 1% p/v 19-dimethyl methylene blue (DMB) pH 3.3–2 M Tris-Base for at least 1 min and for up to 5 min. A spectrophotometer BioSpec-1601 (Shimadzu USA) was used to read samples at 520 nm. The results were compared against a standard curve of chondroitin sulfate A (Sigma-Aldrich. USA).

Lysosomal mass determination

Lysosomal determination was evaluated by two approaches: epifluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. In the first case the fibroblasts were seeded on coverslips treated with 50 µg/mL PolyD-Lysine (Gibco USA) before LP- or MLPs-transfection procedure. After one month of treatment the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde 4% and stained using LysoTracker Deep Red (L12492; Thermo Fisher Scientific USA) as described previously1135. Later the cells were also stained with DAPI (Fluoroshield mounting medium Abcam UK) to observe the nucleus. Coverslips cells were placed on slides and then visualized using an Axio Observer Z1 microscope (ZEISS Birkerød Denmark) with a Filter set 109 HE LED (E) containing beam splitter TBS 405 + 575 and an emission filter TBP 425/29 + 632/100. This configuration collected the DAPI and Lysotracker signals respectively. The images were processed with the ImageJ software75. Regarding flow cytometry a BD FACSAria™ III Cell Sorter (Ex/Em: 647/668 nm) was used to acquire at least 50000 events following the protocol described by Leal & Alméciga 202211. Propidium iodide 1 mg/mL (Sigma-Aldrich; USA) was used to identify viable cells. Only the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) from singlets was included for the analysis on FlowJo software.

Mitochondrial-derived reactive oxidative species (mtROS)

The MitoSOX Red indicator (Thermo Fisher Scientific USA) was used to evaluate mtROS in cells treated for one month. A cell monolayer was incubated with 2.5 µM MitoSOX in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (1X) for 15 min. At least 10000 events were recorded in a Cytek Aurora CS cytometer using PE—Red (Ex/Em: 510/580 nm) channel. 100 µM CoCl 2 (Sigma-Aldrich USA) was used as a positive control according to previous reports11. Treatment with CoCl 2 failed to promote cell death (data no show).

Hexosaminidase enzyme assay

After LP- or MLPs-transfection the cells were lysed with deoxycholate 1% plus 1 mM PMSF. Later 50 µL of the sample were incubated with 20µL/32 mM 4-MU-NAG (4-Methylumbelliferyl N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide Sigma-Aldrich USA) for 20 min at 37 °C777879. 150 µL 0.2 M glycine pH 10.8 were used as a stop buffer solution. Samples were read and analyzed as described for the GALNS enzyme assay.

Griess determination

The presence of nitric oxide-derived species (NO) was determined by a test based on the Griess reagent (Sigma-Aldrich USA)80. Briefly 100 µL of supernatant collected from untreated or treated cells were incubated with 100 µL of the Griess reagent for 15 min at room temperature. 1 µM lipopolysaccharide Escherichia coli O111:B4 (Sigma-Aldrich USA) was used as a positive control. Samples were read in a microplate reader (Biochrom Anthos 2020 UK) at 562/630 nm. The results were extrapolated to a nitrite standard curve which was performed using NaNO 2 (Sigma-Aldrich USA).

Statistical analysis

The data was processed in GraphPad Prism version 8.0.0 for Mac (GraphPad Software San Diego California USA). Normal distribution and homoscedasticity were evaluated through Shapiro–Wilk Test and Leve Test respectively. Mean comparison between groups was addressed with a t-student test a Mann–Whitney U test or an ANOVA according to the Shapiro–Wilk test findings. The experiments were performed in at least three independent experiments in triplicate. All the data is presented as mean ± standard error (SE). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNDY3LTAyMi0zMjg1NS0z0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The TFEB-TGIF1 axis regulates EMT in mouse epicardial cells,"Dynamic Tfeb expression in embryonic mouse epicardial cells

To explore Tfeb expression during embryonic development we used a TfebEGFP mouse model in which the EGFP gene is knocked into the Tfeb locus resulting in the fusion protein TFEB-EGFP (Fig. 1a)33. At E11.5 Tfeb-EGFP was expressed in the heart myocardium and at a particularly strong level in epicardial cells (Fig. 1b) and in placental trophoblasts and endothelial capillaries (Supplementary Fig. 1) as previously reported3338. To further investigate whether Tfeb expression correlated with a particular stage of epicardial development we analyzed EGFP expression in the heart tissues of wild-type and TfebEGFP mice from E9.5 to E15.5 and in adults (Fig. 1c). Tfeb was specifically expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of WT1+ cells in the PE at E9.5 and in the epicardium up to E15.5. The expression decreased during development and was barely detectable in adult epicardial cells (Fig. 1c). To determine whether Tfeb expression differs in epicardial and epicardially derived cells undergoing EMT we costained hearts at E13.5 for EGFP and markers of EMT (Fig. 1d). Epicardial cells localized above the basement membrane that was stained with an anti-laminin antibody contained a significantly higher amount of TFEB-EGFP than EPDCs localized in the subepicardial space between the basement membrane and the myocardial surface (Fig. 1d i). Staining for the EMT-associated transcription factor Slug46 demonstrated that epicardial TFEB-EGFP+ cells had only 9% Slug+ nuclei while subepicardial TFEB-EGFP- cells had 56% Slug+ nuclei (Fig. 1d ii). Accordingly subepicardial TFEB-EGFP- cells were positive for PDGFRα or PDGFRβ which are markers of fibroblast and SMC differentiation respectively1112 (Fig. 1d iii iv). To further verify the correlation between Tfeb expression and the epithelial state of epicardial cells we cultured epicardial explants from E11.5 TfebEGFP hearts and induced EMT by TGFβ1 treatment. Figure 1e shows that TGFβ1 challenge resulted in a mesenchymal phenotype as shown by the development of α-smooth muscle actin (SMA)+ stress fibers and the increase in cell size. TFEB-EGFP was present in the nuclei of untreated epicardial cells and was reduced twice in cells differentiated into α-SMA+ myofibroblasts.

Image quantification was performed as follows. i Cells above the laminin-marked basement membrane were considered epicardial (epi) and cells between the basement membrane and myocardial surface were considered subepicardial (subepi).

To implement a more suitable model to study TFEB functions we derived a mouse embryonic epicardial cell line (MEC) as described in ref. 47. MECs showed a typical epicardial cobblestone-like morphology (Supplementary Fig. 3a) with cortical distribution of the tight junction protein ZO1 (Fig. 2a) expressed the epicardium-specific TFs WT1 and TBX18 and did not contain contaminating cells such as endothelial cells (ECs; CD31+) cardiomyocytes (cTnT+) fibroblasts (PDGFRα+) and SMCs (PDGFRβ+; Supplementary Fig. 3b). TGFβ1 treatment triggered EMT as inferred by the increase in cell size the loss of WT1 and ZO1 and the positivity for the smooth muscle proteins αSMA and Sm22α (Fig. 2a). MECs expressed TFEB but during EMT both TFEB transcript and protein levels gradually decreased (Fig. 2b c). Both in primary epicardial cells and in MECs Tfeb was the most highly expressed member of the MITF family (Fig. 2d).

Fig. 2: Tfeb is downregulated during EMT in MECs. a MECs undergo EMT upon TGFβ1 treatment. MECs were treated with 10 ng/ml TGFβ1 in 2% FCS for 24 and 48 h to trigger EMT and then fixed and immunostained for epithelial (ZO1) epicardial (WT1) and SMC (αSMA and Sm22α) markers. The experiment was repeated three times with similar results.

Tfeb overexpression in the embryonic epicardium is lethal due to an impairment of EMT

Tfeb downregulation in epicardial cells during EMT suggested its role in EMT regulation. To investigate this possibility we generated a mouse model in which Tfeb expression in EPDCs persisted.

Tfeb-flagfs mice48 were crossed with mice expressing Cre under the control of the epicardium-specific Gata5 promoter8 (Fig. 3a). Tfeb overexpression in the epicardium was lethal. At weaning the analysis of 54 animals showed the absence of Gata5+; Tfebfs mice in contrast with the 25% expected Mendelian frequency given that the parents were heterozygous for Gata5 and Tfebfs alleles (χ2 test; p value <0.001; Table 1). To establish when exactly the embryos died we collected litters at different gestational stages. At E17.5 among the 29 collected embryos no live Gata5+; Tfebfs embryos were found (χ2 test; p value <0.05; Table 1); however 2 of the 3 collected resorbed embryos had the Gata5+; Tfebfs genotype. The distribution of genotypes of the embryos collected before E15.5 was not different from the expected distribution (p value >0.99).

Table 1 Tfeb overexpression in the epicardium is lethal Full size table

Gata5+; Tfebfs embryos at E15.5 were smaller than their wild-type littermates with hemorrhagic areas (Fig. 3b). Microcomputed tomography (Micro-CT) scanning (Fig. 3c d) revealed that the Tfeb-overexpressing embryos were edematous as indicated by the significant increase in pericardial cavity volume and demonstrated enlarged atria. Mutant mice also had a thinner compact myocardium layer with a significant decrease in thickness in the right ventricle and interventricular septum. Six of eight analyzed Gata5+; Tfebfs embryos developed an incomplete interventricular septum while the control littermates (n = 8) did not show any defects. Consistent with the fact that Gata5 is active in the PE at E9.5–10.58 Cre recombinase and TFEB-FLAG were already detected in WT1+ cells at E9.5 (Supplementary Fig. 4). Immunostaining of E15.5 hearts (Fig. 3e) showed that the epicardial layer of mutant embryos marked with WT1 was fully formed and expressed TFEB-FLAG indicating that Tfeb overexpression did not alter the survival or proliferation of epicardial cells. However many fewer WT1-positive cells were found inside the myocardium of the Gata5+; Tfebfs embryos (Fig. 3e). Moreover PDGFRβ+ and PDGFRα+ cells which are both derived from epicardial cells were strikingly decreased in the mutant hearts (Fig. 3e). The quantification of both the number of PDGFRα+ or PDGFRβ+ cells invading the myocardium and the depth of the invasion of each PDGFRα+ or PDGFRβ+ cell from the surface confirmed the severe phenotype (Fig. 3e). Taking all these observations together we hypothesized that Tfeb overexpression would halt the differentiation of EPDCs leading to the development of hearts with defects derived from the poor differentiation of epicardial cells in vSMCs and fibroblasts. Of note the CD31+ endothelial cell population was not diminished in the Gata5+; Tfebfs myocardium (Fig. 3e) according to previous findings that the coronary endothelium mainly derives from the endocardium and sinus venosus4950. To verify whether Tfeb overexpression influenced epicardial EMT or the subsequent migration and differentiation of EPDCs we analyzed the Gata5+; Tfebfs embryos at E13.5 when EMT has already begun16. To visualize epicardial cell delamination we immunostained the basement membrane with an antibody against laminin and counted epicardial cell nuclei localized above the membrane and subepicardial cell nuclei between the basement membrane and the myocardium surface (Fig. 3f i). In the control embryos the ratio between epicardial and subepicardial cells was 1:1.31 while in the Gata5+; Tfebfs embryos it was 1:054 suggesting a strong inhibition of derivation of mesenchymal cells (Fig. 3f i). We also quantified the epicardial cells and EPDCs positive for the EMT-activating TFs Slug Zeb and Twist51. These EMT markers were consistently reduced in the Gata5+; Tfebfs embryos: from 51% of Slug+ cells in the controls to 24% in the Tfeb-overexpressing epicardial cells and EPDCs from 31% to 16% for Zeb+ and from 28% to 7% for Twist+ (Fig. 3f ii–iv). No difference in proliferation rate evaluated as positivity for Ki67 was observed (Supplementary Fig. 5v). These data suggest that Tfeb overexpression severely inhibited but did not fully abolish epicardial EMT starting from the early stages.

TFEB regulates EMT in primary mouse epicardial cells and MECs

Thereafter we evaluated the effect of Tfeb overexpression on TGFβ1-induced EMT in primary epicardial cells isolated from the Gata5+; Tfebfs mice. Epicardial explants from the mutant embryos grew similarly to those from the wild-type embryos and contained TFEB-FLAG in the nuclei (Fig. 4a) indicating that overexpressed TFEB did not affect cell survival and proliferation. However the Gata5+; Tfebfs epicardial cells showed a significantly weaker response to TGFβ1 treatment as demonstrated by αSMA expression and cell size (Fig. 4b).

Superimposable results were obtained by infecting MECs with a lentivirus encoding the constitutively active TFEB mutant S142A26 under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter (MEC-TFEB S142A) (Supplementary Fig. 6a b). After induction TFEB S142A was localized to nuclei ensuring protein activity (Supplementary Fig. 6b) and after 2 days it did not show toxic effects as demonstrated by a slight increase in BrdU incorporation consistent with previous reports3334 (Supplementary Fig. 6c).

To further support the observation that TFEB S142A overexpression inhibited MEC response to TGFβ1 we analyzed the expression of 85 EMT-related genes such as myofibroblast-specific proteins and extracellular matrix components selected by Gene Ontology annotations in the MECs overexpressing TFEB S142A and treated with TGFβ1 by real-time PCR. Twenty-five genes were significantly downregulated in the doxycycline-treated MEC-TFEB S142A cells stimulated with TGFβ1 compared to the TGFβ1-stimulated MEC-TFEB S142A cells nontreated with doxycycline (Student’s test p value <0.05; Fig. 4c). Next we analyzed the expression of well-known EMT markers in a time-course experiment after TGFβ1 stimulation (Fig. 4d). Tfeb overexpression blocked the induction of the EMT-activating TFs Twist Zeb and Tcf21 and delayed and diminished the increase in the transcription factor Slug the mesenchymal markers CTGF and FN and the smooth muscle markers Acta2 and Tagln. This analysis was further validated by evaluating the protein levels of selected targets. Figure 4e shows that the increased expression of the Acta2 gene-encoded α-SMA and Tagln gene-encoded Sm22α proteins induced by TGFβ1 was blunted in the doxycycline-treated MEC-TFEB S142A cells.

Since overexpressed TFEBS142A acted as an inhibitor of EMT in MEC cells siRNA-mediated silencing was used to determine whether endogenous TFEB might have the same role (Supplementary Fig. 6d). We evaluated the expression of SMC markers (α-SMA and Sm22α) at the mRNA (Fig. 4f) and protein (Fig. 4g) levels and found that in the Tfeb-silenced MECs the SMC markers were upregulated. The expression of TFEB S142A after Tfeb silencing rescued the MEC phenotype (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig. 6e). Independent of the presence of TGFβ1 Tfeb-silenced MECs showed an upregulation of Acta2 and Tagln transcripts which was reduced after TFEB S142A reintroduction (Fig. 4h).

TFEB modulates EMT through TGIF1

To provide insights into the mechanisms sustaining the regulatory effect of TFEB in the mesenchymal transition of epicardial cells we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) in MECs overexpressing TFEB S142A. To prevent the possible side effects of excessive TFEB accumulation we set 8 h of doxycycline induction as the minimum to guarantee TFEB S142A overexpression in most of the nuclei (Supplementary Fig. 6g). The 8258 peaks of TFEB S142A DNA binding were called with medium stringency (Supplementary Fig. 7a). The annotation of peak genomic distribution executed by HOMER software52 showed that gene promoters and 5’ untranslated regions (UTRs) were strongly enriched among the TFEB target regions (Supplementary Fig. 7b). For further analysis we focused on the set of 1899 peaks superimposing mouse promoter regions defined as −2500 bp and +2500 bp from the transcription start site (TSS) of 1928 protein-coding genes annotated by GREAT 3.0.0 software53. Thirty-two percent of the TSS-associated peaks directly contained a TFEB-binding motif specified by the JASPAR matrix (relative score >0.6)54. Furthermore de novo motif discovery on the complete set of sequences of the TSS-associated peaks demonstrated a strong enrichment in the E-box CACGTG TFEB-binding motif (p value 10−29; Supplementary Fig. 7a). Functional annotation of TFEB target genes performed by GREAT (Supplementary Fig. 7c) revealed the most important enrichment for functional groups related to the regulation of transcription including DNA binding and TF activity itself as well as TF binding and cofactor activity. In terms of biology TFEB targets are involved in the regulation of cell differentiation epithelial phenotype cytoskeleton rearrangement adhesion and motility which are the processes underlying EMT. Notably among TFEB target genes there were components of the TGFβ/SMAD and PDGFR signaling pathways which are involved in epicardial EMT regulation.

We demonstrated above that the TFEB inhibitory effect on EMT was underpinned by the decreased expression of many genes. The presence of many transcriptional regulators and a marked enrichment of genes belonging to the TGFβ pathway in the ChIP-seq dataset prompted us to hypothesize that TFEB might directly upregulate a transcriptional repressor or an inhibitory cofactor of the TGFβ-activated gene response which is crucial for epicardial EMT. Among the TFEB ChIP-seq targets harboring this function the Tgif1 Ski and Skil genes were identified455556 (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 8a b). We excluded Ski and Skil after experimental validation. In MECs Ski expression did not depend on overexpressed or endogenous TFEB (Supplementary Fig. 8c). Skil mRNA expression was upregulated by TFEB S142A and downregulated by Tfeb silencing (Supplementary Fig. 8d); nevertheless Skil silencing did not rescue the inhibition of the Acta2 transcript by TFEB S142A overexpression (Supplementary Fig. 8e f).

TGIF1 was reported to inhibit TGFβ signaling by directly binding the SMAD2 and SMAD4 complexes and repressing TGFβ-induced SMAD-mediated transcription4445. ChIP-seq analysis revealed a peak of TFEB S142A binding overlapping the Tgif1 promoter region (Fig. 5a). Bioinformatic analysis of the sequence of the ChIP-seq peak revealed the presence of a TFEB Jaspar binding site. To demonstrate the direct activity of TFEB on the Tgif1 promoter we designed two luciferase reporter constructs with the Tgif1 full promoter sequence (−1106; +310 bp around the TSS) and the mutant version lacking the TFEB binding peak (pTGIF1-full and pTGIF1-del) which were transfected into MEC-TFEB S142A cells. The overexpression of TFEB S142 by doxycycline resulted in a 60% increase in pTGIF1 full promoter activity while no increase was observed for the mutated promoter (Fig. 5b). Accordingly immunofluorescence analysis showed an increase in TGIF1 protein expression in the TFEB S142A-MECs starting after 8 h of doxycycline treatment (Fig. 5c) and persisting after 24 and 48 h (Fig. 6b). This finding was confirmed by transcript analysis showing that Tgif1 mRNA expression was strongly upregulated upon TFEB S142A overexpression and downregulated in the Tfeb-silenced MECs (Fig. 5d).

To verify whether TFEB inhibited TGFβ1-induced EMT in the TFEB S142A-MECs by upregulating Tgif1 we performed a rescue experiment by simultaneous overexpression of TFEB S142A and knockdown of Tgif1 by a lentiviral vector carrying shTGIF1. After 24 h the cells were treated with TGFβ1. Doxycycline-induced TFEB S142A expression caused a strong increase in Tgif1 mRNA (Fig. 6a) and protein (Fig. 6b) expression which was mainly nuclear. Tgif1 silencing completely abolished the observed upregulation induced by TFEB S142A; however importantly it did not reduce the mRNA and protein levels below those in the untreated cells (Fig. 6a b). In addition our experiment showed the induction of TGIF1 by TGFβ1 under normal conditions confirming previous reports57. Fig. 6a shows that Tgif1 knockdown rescued the inhibitory effect of TFEB S142A on the upregulation of ACTA2 and Tagln mRNA after stimulation with TGFβ1. Similarly the expression of the Tagln gene-encoded Sm22α protein observed in the MECs challenged with TGFβ1 was inhibited by TFEB S142A overexpression but completely rescued by Tgif1 silencing (Fig. 6c). The increase in cell size which characterizes EMT was also controlled by the TFEB-TGIF1 signaling axis. Tgif1 knockdown abolished the TFEB S142A-induced inhibition of the cell size increase upon TGFβ1 treatment (Fig. 6c). Altogether the results of the rescue experiment suggested that TFEB inhibited TGFβ1-induced EMT in epicardial cells in vitro by directly upregulating Tgif1.

To validate these in vitro findings in vivo we analyzed the expression of Tgif1 in the epicardium of the Gata5; Tfebfs and control E15.5 embryos by immunofluorescence and found a strong increase in TGIF1 protein expression in the nuclei of the mutant embryos (Fig. 6d). This result was further confirmed in primary epicardial cells cultured from the Gata5+; Tfebfs and control embryos. Both under basal conditions and during the differentiation induced by TGFβ1 Tgif1 was significantly upregulated in the TFEB-overexpressing cells (Fig. 6e).

Altogether these data indicate that overexpressed Tfeb acts through Tgif1 upregulation ultimately inhibiting the cell response to TGFβ1 both in vitro and in vivo.

Dynamics of the TGFβ1 regulation of TGIF1 and TFEB

To investigate the physiological role of TFEB in TGIF1 regulation of TGFβ1 signaling we first examined the time-dependence of TGIF1 expression after TGFβ1 stimulation. For the transcriptional response to TGFβ1 signaling TGIF1 repression should be promptly lifted. This kind of regulation was shown for other TGFβ1 inhibitors such as Ski and SnoN: after TGFβ1 treatment the repressor proteins are rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery with the minimum level reached in 15–45 min; at the same time their mRNA is de novo synthesized leading to the restored protein level at ∼2 h56585960. To determine whether TGIF1 shares the same regulatory pattern we evaluated its mRNA and protein levels in MECs after TGFβ1 treatment in the absence and presence of the proteosome inhibitor lactacystin. TGFβ1 stimulation caused a significant decrease in TGIF1 protein expression after 15 and 30 min which was followed by a restoration of protein levels after 1 h and an increase after 24 h (Fig. 7a). Lactacystin completely abolished TGIF1 protein level decrease suggesting the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system degradation (Fig. 7a). A TGIF1 mRNA increase was observed starting from 1 h of TGFβ1 treatment (Fig. 7b). Therefore it is conceivable that similar to Ski and SnoN TGFβ1 caused rapid short-term TGIF1 protein degradation and long-term transcriptional upregulation (Fig. 7c). We also examined whether TGFβ1 had any short-term effects on TFEB protein levels and did not observe any effects (Supplementary Fig. 9a and Fig. 7c).

The role of the TFEB-TGIF1 axis in TGFβ signaling under physiological conditions

Because mechanistic information revealing the function of TFEB was obtained in Tfeb-overexpressing models we evaluated the TFEB-TGIF1 axis under physiological conditions. We found that endogenous TFEB inhibited mesenchymal differentiation of MECs (Fig. 4f g) and that in the Tfeb-silenced MECs Tgif1 was downregulated (Fig. 5d). Next we compared the effects of Tfeb and Tgif1 silencing on the TGFβ1-elicited dose-dependent transcription of the EMT marker gene Acta2 in MECs (Fig. 8a). As previously reported44 Tgif1 silencing sensitized and amplified the increase in Acta2 mRNA in response to both low and high doses of TGFβ1 (Fig. 8a). The shCtrl-expressing cells responded to TGFβ1 starting from concentrations of 0.5 ng/ml while Tfeb or Tgif1 silencing sensitized the cell response to 0.05 ng/ml TGFβ1. The shTFEB and shTGIF1 MECs showed significantly stronger responses to low concentrations (0.05–1 ng/ml) of TGFβ1. According to the interplay between TFEB S142A and TGIF1 demonstrated above (Fig. 6) it is likely that the sensitization effect of Tfeb deletion relied on the lack of TGIF1. To test this hypothesis we evaluated TGIF1 protein levels in the MECs with Tfeb silencing treated with low (0.05 ng/ml) and high (10 ng/ml) concentrations of TGFβ1 for 15 min the time point at which we observed the lowest level of TGIF1 (Fig. 7a). Low amounts of TGFβ1 (0.05 ng/ml) caused a 30% reduction in TGIF1 examined by immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 8b and Supplementary Fig. 9b) which was not sufficient to remove transcriptional inhibition of Acta2 (Fig. 8a). In the MECs stimulated with 10 ng/ml TGFβ1 TGIF1 was reduced by 60% which allowed a transcriptional response (Fig. 8b a). In the siTfeb MECs the TGIF1 protein level was low under basal conditions and 0.05 ng/ml TGFβ1 treatment resulted in a 60% reduction permitting a transcriptional response (Fig. 8b a).

Fig. 8: Tfeb silencing in MECs sensitized them to lower concentrations of TGFβ1. a Tfeb and Tgif1 silencing caused a stronger upregulation of the Acta2 transcript in response to low doses of TGFβ1. MECs were infected with a lentivirus coding for a shRNA for Tfeb or Tgif1 or control shRNA. Cells were treated with 0.05 0.5 1 5 and 10 ng/ml TGFβ1 for 24 h. The Acta2 mRNA quantity was assessed by real-time PCR analysis. Values are shown as the mean ± SEM n = 4.

Then the hearts were removed and the explants were cultured for 48 h in DMEM with 10% FCS and 0.5 ng/ml or 10 ng/ml TGFβ1 and immunostained for αSMA (representave images in top panel). The αSMA immunofluorescence signal was quantified in ImageJ software and five explants and at least four images for an explant were analyzed for an experimental point (plot in bottom panel). Box plot shows the quartiles the 5th and 95th percentiles (whiskers). Student’s two-tailed t test p values are reported in the plot. f A proposed model for the role of TFEB and TGIF1 in the regulation of TGFβ1 signaling. Under basal conditions TFEB expressed in epicardial cells is required to establish an appropriate quantity of TGIF1 protein. TGFβ1 stimulation rapidly initiates proteosome-dependent TGIF1 degradation; however a low concentration of TGFβ1 is not sufficient to remove TGIF1 repression thus creating a dose-dependent response.

To verify in vivo whether the lack of Tfeb had the same effects observed in vitro we generated a mouse model in which Tfeb was knocked out in epicardial cells by crossing Gata5-Cre with Tfeb flox/flox mice. The resulting Gata5+; Tfeb flox/flox mice were healthy and did not present visible pre- or postnatal morphological defects. No difference in the EMT intensity assessed as the number of delaminated mesenchymal cells and Slug+ epicardial cells and EPDCs was found in the E13.5 embryos (Supplementary Fig. 10). However the staining for PDGFRα and PDGFRβ revealed a significant increase in fibroblast and SMC precursors at E13.5 (Fig. 8c). These findings suggest a premature differentiation of the Tfeb-deleted EPDCs into SMCs and fibroblasts which however was recovered at later developmental stages.

We analyzed TGIF1 protein levels in epicardial cell nuclei of the E12.5 Gata5+; Tfebflox/flox embryos and found a 21% reduction compared to the controls (Fig. 8d). Therefore we investigated the response to TGFβ1 in epicardial cells cultured from the Gata5+; Tfebflox/flox embryos. The efficiency of Tfeb deletion in epicardial cells was confirmed by real-time PCR analysis of Tfeb mRNA in the mutant and control epicardial explants (Supplementary Fig. 10a). Next we cultured the Gata5+; Tfebflox/flox epicardial explants for 48 h in the presence of 0.5 or 10 ng/ml TGFβ1. Immunostaining revealed that low TGFβ1 amounts significantly increased the synthesis of α-SMA in epicardial cells isolated from the Tfeb knockout but not from the control animals (Fig. 8e).

Taken together these findings suggest a model (Fig. 8f) in which TFEB present in epicardial cells under physiological conditions is necessary to establish a TGIF1 protein quantity threshold allowing a dose-response to TGFβ1. TGFβ1 stimulation initiates rapid TGIF1 proteasomal degradation; however a high dose of TGFβ1 is required to reduce TGIF1 to a level that allows initiation of transcription. Long-term TGFβ1 treatment promotes an increase in TGIF1 protein probably functioning as a feedback mechanism.

It is likely that excess TGIF1 levels observed in the TFEBS142A-overexpressing MECs and in Gata5+; Tfebfs embryos strongly inhibited the response even to high doses of TGFβ1. In contrast an insufficient level of TGIF1 observed in siTfeb MECs and in Gata5+; Tfebflox/flox primary epicardial cells allowed the response to low doses of TGFβ1 which under physiological conditions do not promote a response.

TFEB regulates EMT in vascular endothelial cells and in epithelial MDCK cells

To verify whether the regulatory effect of TFEB on EMT is restricted to epicardial development or may represent a more general mechanism we investigated whether this function of TFEB occurs in other cell types. ECs physiologically express TFEB both in embryos and adults33 and undergo a process analogous to EMT named endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). EndMT is governed by a network of growth factors shared with EMT including the TGFβ family. However TGFβ2 is considered to be a stronger EndMT inducer than TGFβ16162. TFEB was expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) under basal conditions and downregulated by TGFβ2 treatment similar to what we observed in epicardial cells (Fig. 9a). TGFβ2 stimulation for 3 and 5 days triggered EndMT as demonstrated by the increase in SM22α expression while αSMA expression did not change significantly. TFEB S142A overexpression completely abrogated the upregulation of SM22α indicating the inhibition of EndMT (Fig. 9b).

Fig. 9: TFEB S142A overexpression inhibits EndMT in human endothelial cells and EMT in MDCK cells. a TFEB expression decreases during EndMT.

Finally we investigated the effect of TFEB on TGFβ-induced EMT in renal tubular epithelial cells (MDCK) a prototypical cell model of EMT63 (Fig. 9c). TGFβ1 treatment for 5 days induced EMT characterized by an increase in αSMA and SM22α and TFEB S142A overexpression strongly diminished αSMA expression. No effect of TFEB S142A on SM22α expression was observed in this cell type probably because it did not respond strongly to TGFβ in the first place.

Altogether this evidence supports the idea that the regulatory effect of TFEB on EMT is not confined to epicardial development but is a more general mechanism.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNDE5LTAyMi0wNTIwOC030gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SMYD3 promotes aerobic glycolysis in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma via H3K4me3-mediated PKM2 transcription | Cell ...,"SMYD3 upregulation is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with DLBCL

To identify the role of HMTs in DLBCL 22 HMT genes associated with tumor progression according to previous studies [202122232425262728293031] (Table S1) were first selected. These genes were then analyzed in multiple DLBCL public datasets. The survival analysis of the GSE87371 dataset using R language revealed that the lower mRNA expression levels of euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1) nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein (NSD) 1 Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 1-like 1(WHSC1L1/NSD3) and SET domain containing 1 A histone lysine methyltransferase (SETD1A) were significantly associated with the poor progression-free survival (PFS) and OS of DLBCL patients (Fig. S1A B). However the higher mRNA level of SMYD3 was significantly associated with the poor OS of DLBCL patients in the GSE87371 dataset (Fig. 1A). TCGA database indicated that the mRNA levels of these genes in DLBCL were significantly higher than those of normal tissue samples (Fig. 1B C; Fig. S1C). The Oncomine database also suggested that the mRNA expression levels of SMYD3 in DLBCL were significantly higher than those of normal tissue samples in the Nature 2009 dataset (Fig. 1D).

Fig. 1: High levels of SMYD3 are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with DLBCL. A High mRNA levels of SMYD3 were associated with poor OS in patients with DLBCL from the GSE87371 dataset. B The mRNA levels [log 2 (TPM + 1)] of SMYD3 EHMT1 NSD1 WHSC1L1 (NSD3) and SETD1A were significantly higher in DLBCL than those of normal tissue samples in TCGA database. Analysis of (C) TCGA and D Oncomine databases suggested that the mRNA levels of SMYD3 in DLBCLs were significantly higher than those of normal tissue samples. The E mRNA and F protein expression levels of SMYD3 in DLBCL clinical samples were significantly higher than those in RLH samples.

The aforementioned results were then validated in clinical samples. The mRNA levels of SMYD3 were significantly upregulated in DLBCL compared with RLH tissue samples (P < 0.05; Fig. 1E). Similarly SMYD3 protein expression was higher in DLBCL than in RLH (P = 0.009; Fig. 1F G).

A total of 166 DLBCL cases were then divided into a high (H-score>120 73 cases 44.0%) and a low SMYD3 expression group (H-score < 120 93 cases 56.0%) according to the cutoff of the SMYD3 H-score based on the ROC curve. Patients of DLBCL with high levels of SMYD3 protein were more likely to have a higher Ann Arbor stage (III and IV; P = 0.018) and a higher level of serum LDH (>240 U/l P = 0.032). Moreover they exhibited poor responsiveness to chemotherapy (P = 0.015) and poor prognosis for this group (P = 0.017; Table 1). Kaplan-Meier curves suggested that patients with DLBCL and high SMYD3 expression had poor PFS (P = 0.006) and OS (P = 0.0002) than patients with low SMYD3 expression (Fig. 1H I). Univariate analysis indicated that patients with high SMYD3 protein expression levels had a 1.184-fold increase in the risk of disease progression recurrence or death [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.184; 95% CI 1.369–3.486; P = 0.001; Table 2) and a 2.119-fold increase in the risk of death (HR = 3.119; 95% CI 1.826–5.328; P < 0.001; Table 3). Multivariate analysis confirmed that high SMYD3 protein expression was an independent prognostic marker for poor PFS (HR = 1.728; 95% CI 1.070–2.791; P = 0.025; Table 2) and OS (HR = 2.645; 95% CI 1.534–4.558; P < 0.001; Table 3) in patients with DLBCL. Moreover the combination of SMYD3 protein expression level with Ann Arbor stage B symptoms IPI score and serum LDH level could better predict OS than each factor individually (P = 0.0001 the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) = 0.731 Fig. 1J).

Together these results demonstrated that SMYD3 expression was upregulated in DLBCL and that the predictive value of SMYD3 expression levels for poor prognosis was independent of known factors.

SMYD3 promotes DLBCL cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo

The functional role of SMYD3 in DLBCL was then evaluated. The mRNA and protein levels of SMYD3 were examined in six DLBCL cell lines. The OCI-LY1 and OCI-LY8 cell lines which had relatively high SMYD3 mRNA and protein expression levels were selected for SMYD3 stable knockdown using shRNA (Fig. 2A). Stable transfection of SMYD3 shRNA efficiently silenced the mRNA and protein expression of SMYD3 in OCI-LY1 and OCI-LY8 cells (Fig. 2B). In addition CCK-8 assays performed over a period of 5 days showed that OCI-LY1 and OCI-LY8 cells proliferated much more slowly following knockdown of SMYD3 with two independent shRNA constructs (Fig. 2C). Stable overexpression of SMYD3 was also carried out in the HBL1 cell line. A CCK-8 assay revealed that HBL1 cells proliferated slightly more rapidly following SMYD3 overexpression compared with vector control cells (Fig. S2) as SMYD3 was innately expressed at high levels in these cells.

To further validate the effect of SMYD3 on proliferation in vivo SMYD3-knockdown OCI-LY1 and OCI-LY8 cells and respective control cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice. The volumes proliferation rate and weight of the tumors formed by the SMYD3-knockdown OCI-LY1 and OCI-LY8 cells were significantly decreased compared with the respective control cells (Fig. 2D). IHC staining also showed that Ki-67 protein expression decreased in SMYD3-knockdown OCI-LY8 xenografts (Fig. 2E).

The role of SMYD3 in responsiveness to doxorubicin treatment was then assessed. CCK-8 assays revealed that SMYD3 knockdown significantly decreased the IC 50 value of doxorubicin in OCI-LY1 and OCI-LY8 cell lines (Fig. 2F) and SMYD3 knockdown cells proliferated much more slowly after treatment with doxorubicin over a period of 6 days (Fig. 2G). These results indicated that SMYD3 knockdown increased DLBCL cell susceptibility to doxorubicin. In addition the role of SMYD3 in responsiveness to vincristine was also examined. CCK-8 assay showed that the IC 50 value of vincristine was significantly decreased after SMYD3 knockdown and SMYD3 knockdown cells proliferated much more slowly after treatment with vincristine in OCI-LY1 and OCI-LY8 cell lines (Fig S5).

Together these results suggested that SMYD3 played an important role in promoting DLBCL cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo and that SMYD3 induced doxorubicin and vincristine resistance in DLBCL cells in vitro.

SMYD3 enhances glycolysis in DLBCL cells in vitro and in vivo

To further explore the functional role of SMYD3 in DLBCL RNA-Seq was carried out on total RNA isolated from stable SMYD3-knockdown OCI-LY8 cells transfected with two independent shRNA (shSMYD3 #1 and shSMYD3 #2) and the negative control (NC)OCI-LY8cells. RNA-Seq identified 11738 differentially expressed genes. With a fold-change cutoff of 1.5 or 0.7 and a P-value cutoff of 0.05 gene expression profiling revealed a total of 2267 overlapping differentially expressed genes in shSMYD3 #1 and shSMYD3 #2 versus (vs). NC (Fig. S3A). We then performed GSEA analysis of all the 11738 differentially expressed genes of shSMYD3 #1 vs NC and shSMYD3 #2 vs NC respectively. We focused on the overlapping enriched pathways of those two groups. GSEA of KEGG enrichment showed that the ‘Glycolysis-Gluconeogenesis’ pathway was upregulated in phenotype shSMYD3 #1 (normalized enrichment score (NES) = 1.448 normalized P = 0.040 false discovery rate (FDR) q = 0.134) and shSMYD3 #2 (NES = 1.762 normalized P = 0.005 FDR q = 0.078; Fig. S3B C).

Next we investigated the proteins physically interacted with SMYD3 and explored the function played by SMYD3 in binding with other factors. An endogenous Co-IP assay using an anti-SMYD3 antibody was carried out in OCI-LY8 cells. The proteins co-purified with SMYD3were resolved by SDS-PAGE and major protein bands were excised and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. It identified 541 differentially expressed proteins which were quantifiable (Table S2 SMYD3.vs.IgG_quant) and among them 42 proteins were significantly differentially expressed (significance ≥ 20 Fold Change ≥ 1.5 unique peptides ≥ 2 Table S2 SMYD3.vs.IgG_regulated). Then IPA of these differentially expressed proteins was performed to explore the enriched pathways. Meanwhile the differentially expressed genes examined by RNA-seq were also analyzed by IPA to enrich the associated pathways. Then we focused on the overlapping pathways between LC-MS/MS and RNA-seq (Table S3). It revealed that the ‘glycolysis I’ was one of the top 5 overlapping signaling pathways (Fig. 3A). Then we performed RT-qPCR assay to confirm the mRNA expression level of genes enriched in the ‘glycolysis I’ pathway. The results showed that Pyruvate Kinase M1 (PKM1) and Pyruvate Kinase M2 (PKM2) significantly decreased (P < 0.01) and Fructose-Bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) significantly increased (P < 0.01) following SMYD3 knockdown (Fig. 3B C). However Mann-Whitney test showed that Phosphoglycerate Mutase Family Member 4 (PGAM4) Triosephosphate Isomerase 1 (TPI1) Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Spermatogenic (GAPDHS) Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH) Phosphofructokinase Platelet (PFKP) Fructose-Bisphosphatase 2 (FBP2) Enolase 1(ENO1) Enolase 3 (ENO3) and Aldolase Fructose-Bisphosphate A (ALDOA) did not significantly change after SMYD3 knockdown (Fig. 3B C). IHC staining revealed that the staining intensity and the staining proportion of PKM1 were markedly low (H-score: 0) and that the PKM2 staining intensity was moderate and the staining proportion of PKM2 was about 70% (H-score: 140) in the DLBCL FFPE sample (Fig. S4). Therefore PKM2 was further examined in subsequent experiments. RT-qPCR and western blot analysis demonstrated that the mRNA and protein levels of PKM2 were significantly downregulated after SMYD3 knockdown in OCI-LY1 and OCI-LY8 cells (Fig. 3D). In addition IHC staining revealed that low SMYD3 expression in xenograft tumor tissue was associated with weak PKM2 staining (Fig. 3E).

Full size image

The next experiments were carried out to determine whether SMYD3 modulated glycolysis in DLBCL. SMYD3 knockdown significantly reduced glucose uptake lactate production and pyruvate level in OCI-LY1 and OCI-LY8 cells (Fig. 3F) and decreased the ECAR (Fig. 3G) which reflected glycolytic flux. To validate the effects of SMYD3 on glycolysis in vivo PET/CT scan was used to measure glucose uptake in tumor xenografts from nude mice. The SMYD3 knockdown DLBCL tumors showed a lower SUVmax value compared with the NC suggesting decreased glucose uptake (Fig. 3H). The association between SMYD3 expression and the SUVmax was further analyzed in clinical DLBCL samples. DLBCLs with the SUVmax value before therapy according to PET-CT were chosen (n = 51). The Mann-Whitney U test showed that the SUVmax value of the high SMYD3 expression group was significantly higher than that of the low SMYD3 expression group (P = 0.0001 Fig. 3I J).

These results indicated that SMYD3 upregulated the mRNA and protein expression of PKM2 and promoted glycolysis in DLBCL in vitro and in vivo. The association between SMYD3 expression with glucose uptake was also validated in clinical samples and it demonstrated that higher SMYD3 expression was associated with higher SUVmax value in DLBCL.

SMYD3 promotes PKM2 expression via trimethylation of H3K4 in DLBCL

It has been previously reported that SMYD3 binds to a specific DNA sequence (5’-CCCTCC-3’ or 5’-GGAGGG-3’) in its target genes to regulate gene transcription [32]. Therefore we searched for this specific SMYD3 binding sequence around the transcription start site (TSS) of PKM2. PKM2 contained potential SMYD3 binding elements within a region 2000 bp upstream or downstream of the TSS. Thus it was hypothesized that SMYD3 might directly regulate the transcription of PKM2. To test this possibility a ChIP assay was performed to determine whether SMYD3 could bind to PKM2. ChIP-qPCR and subsequent DNA gel electrophoresis showed that SMYD3 could bind to four specific sites (A(−1062 to −946bp) B(−282 to −129 bp) C(860 to 978 bp) D(1793 to 1980 bp) Fig. 4A) within a region 2000 bp upstream or downstream of the TSS of PKM2 and high levels of SMYD3 occupancy at these sites in the negative control OCI-LY8 cells (NC cells). Compared with the NC cells SMYD3 enrichment was markedly decreased following SMYD3 knockdown (Fig. 4B). In addition SMYD3 occupancy was higher at the proximal promoter binding sites (regions B and C) than at regions A and D (Fig. 4A B). This result supported the notion that SMYD3 takes part in the early steps of gene transcription and facilitates the transition from transcription initiation to early elongation [33].

Full size image

It has been demonstrated that SMYD3 mediates the trimethylation of H3K4 [32 33]. Therefore the next experiments aimed to determine whether SMYD3 regulated PKM2 transcription by trimethylating H3K4. ChIP-qPCR assays showed that H3K4me3 enrichment at the binding sites was significantly reduced following SMYD3 knockdown in OCI-LY8 cells compared with NC cells (Fig. 4C). Similarly the H3K4me3 enrichment was higher at the regions B and C than at regions A and D. These results indicated that SMYD3 played a major role in upregulating H3K4me3 levels on PKM2.

It was demonstrated that the conserved amino-acid sequence (GEELXXXY) in the SET domain of SMYD3 was responsible for the interaction with SAM and the HMTase activity [33]. Therefore the mutant protein (SMYD3 ΔEEL) that lacked the EEL motif did not interact with 3H-labelled SAM and thus was methylation defective [33]. To further confirm that SMYD3 promoted PKM2 transcription via H3K4me3 rescue assays in SMYD3-knockdown OCI-LY1 and OCI-LY8 cells were carried out by transfecting wild-type SMYD3 (SMYD3 WT) or a methylation defective mutant (SMYD3ΔEEL) (Fig. 4D). RT-qPCR assay showed that shSMYD3 cells reconstituted with SMYD3ΔEEL failed to rescue PKM2 mRNA levels in OCI-LY1 and OCI-LY8 cells (Fig. 4E F). The rescue ChIP assay revealed that the enrichment level of SMYD3 in the PKM2 regulatory regions in the SMYD3-WT and SMYD3-Delta EEL cells almost restored to the level of NC cell lines and there were no significant differences between SMYD3-Delta EEL and SMYD3-WT (Fig. 4G). However the enrichment level of H3K4me3 was significantly decreased in SMYD3-Delta EEL cells compared with the NC cells and the SMYD3-WT cells respectively (P < 0.01 Fig. 4H). In the meanwhile SMYD3 WT fully restored PKM2 mRNA levels (Fig. 4E F) and H3K4me3 enrichment compared with NC cells (Fig. 4G H). CCK-8 and metabolic assays also revealed that the transfection with SMYD3 WT but not SMYD3ΔEEL restored cell viability glucose uptake pyruvate levels and lactate production in OCI-LY1 and OCI-LY8 cells (Fig. 4I J). These findings suggested that the HMT activity was required to promote SMYD3- mediated transcriptional activation on the PKM2 gene and to promote the proliferation and glycolysis of DLBCL cells mediated by SMYD3.

SMYD3 protein expression levels were positively associated with PKM2 protein expression and poor responsiveness to chemotherapy in DLBCL

To confirm the relationship between SMYD3 and PKM2 the expression levels of PKM2 were analyzed in clinical samples. IHC staining showed that DLBCL with high SMYD3 protein expression had strong PKM2 staining (Fig. 5A). Spearman’s correlation analysis showed that PKM2 protein expression in 166 DLBCL cases was positively associated with that of SMYD3 (R = 0.3673 P < 0.0001; Fig. 5B). Patients with DLBCL and high PKM2 protein expression levels were more likely to relapse or die within two years (P = 0.046; Table S4). Kaplan-Meier curves showed that high PKM2 protein expression was significantly associated with poor OS (P = 0.0218; Fig. 5C). Multivariate Cox analysis confirmed that PKM2 protein expression was significantly associated with OS despite other clinicopathological parameters (HR = 2.055; 95% CI 1.217–3.471; P = 0.007; Table S5). Moreover ROC curves showed that the combination of SMYD3 and PKM2 protein expression levels could better predict OS than each protein individually (P = 0.0001 AUROC = 0.690 Fig. 5D). Furthermore DLBCLs with high expression of both SMYD3 and PKM2 were associated with poor PFS (P = 0.023) and OS (P < 0.001; Fig. 5E F).

A Representative images of SMYD3 and PKM2 immunohistochemical staining in DLBCL tissue sample were acquired using X10 and X20 objectives. Scale bars 200 μm and 100 μm. B SMYD3 protein expression was positively associated with that of PKM2 in patients with DLBCL (R = 0.4712; P = 0.0002).

H Patients with high SMYD3 expression had a lower response rate than those with low SMYD3 expression. Patients with high SMYD3 expression had poor (I) PFS and J OS following RCHOP therapy.

The association between SMYD3 protein expression and responsiveness to chemotherapy in patients with DLBCL was also evaluated. The Mann-Whitney U test showed that the SMYD3 IHC score of the response group (CR and PR) was significantly lower than that of the no-response group (PD and SD) (P = 0.01; Fig. 5G). Moreover patients with high SMYD3 expression had a lower response rate than those with low SMYD3 expression (P = 0.015 Fig.5H). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that high SMYD3 expression was associated with a poor response (PD and SD) to chemotherapy in DLBCL [odds ratio (OR) = 4.818; 95% CI 1.434–16.193; P = 0.011; Table S6)]. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that high SMYD3 expression was an independent predictive factor for PD and SD to chemotherapy (OR = 4.108; 95% CI 1.108–15.221; P = 0.035 Table S6). Moreover in cases with RCHOP treatment (n = 65) from cohort 1 patients with high SMYD3 expression had poorer PFS and OS (Fig. 5I J) which suggested that high SMYD3 expression was associated with poor responsiveness to this treatment regimen.

Thus SMYD3 and PKM2 might serve as a prognostic panel for DLBCL. In addition SMYD3 was an independent predictive biomarker for poor responsiveness to chemotherapy in DLBCL.",,,

According to Burlington County prosecutors a preliminary investigation has found that Peter Lestician's body was discovered on Friday by two men riding four-wheelers along an ATV trail in Clearfield County Pennsylvania.

PA State Police were called to an abandoned barn in Cooper Township around 4 p.m. and found his body in the front seat of a locked vehicle.

PA State Police listed Lestician's death as a suicide.

Lestician 53 was a person of interest in the death of his longtime girlfriend Sheila Maguire 54 who was found dead in her Florence home on Monday. While authorities say he was possibly the last person to see Maguire alive no charges had been filed against Lestician and prosecutors say there is no direct evidence linking him to the homicide.

Investigators say they are working with the district attorney's office in Pennsylvania to gain permission to search the vehicle and confirm the body's identity. The Burlington County Prosecutor's Office says it will continue to investigate Maguire's homicide.

An autopsy found that Maguire was killed by blunt force trauma to her head at her home on Birch Hollow Drive prosecutors say. Maguire and Lestician lived together at the home. Maguire's daughters requested police to make a wellness check at the home Monday after not hearing from their mother for several days according to prosecutors.

Previous reports said that Lestician had not been seen since last weekend. Prosecutors confirmed that he had not made contact with any family members since Aug. 26.

Maguire's social media posts say that the couple met around eight years ago when Lestician was a coach for her daughter's softball team. He led Hightstown High School to its first state title in his second year as coach and was named NJ.com's Softball Coach of the Year in 2019.

Special to Utica Observer-Dispatch USA TODAY Network

I like getting letters but very few people seem to write them anymore.

I do get emails however and I like them too because they often make column writing easier.

I’ve received several good ones recently including one from longtime area coach and athletic director Kathy Faber who wrote to tell me about a great rescue performed by Bill Boyle and Ryan Fagan earlier this summer.

Boyle was sitting on his deck at Canadarago Lake drinking his morning coffee and watching an eagle hunting up its breakfast. There was a boat out on the lake trolling with planer boards and the eagle decided that one of the trailing lures might be edible and dropped out of the sky and into the water to get it.

Not a good idea.

The bird became entangled and was in danger of drowning. Boyle enlisted the help of Fagan who netted the bird which then somehow freed itself from the lure and turned out of the net. The eagle was exhausted however and couldn’t get off the water. Fagan netted it again and he and Boyle worked their way against the wind to Deowongo Island where they released it again. The eagle stood in place for a while on the shore then flew-hopped to a bench on the island sat there for about 20 minutes then flew up into a tree and soon was gone.

The rescue wasn’t an easy task since the bird as you might imagine was not in the best of moods. It was great work by Boyle and Fagan.

Fagan thinks the bird was a golden eagle. Tom Salo of the Delaware-Otsego Audubon Society’s Franklin Mountain Hawk Watch has been studying goldens for many years and he is quite sure after looking at photos it was an immature bald eagle. Immatures lack the signature white head and tail and look somewhat like goldens. (Salo wrote an excellent story on golden eagles in the December 2014 New York State Conservationist. You should be able to find it on line.)

By the way you are likely to see bald eagles almost any day near Canadarago and Otsego lakes. I’ve seen them pluck fish out of the water riding thermals standing out in fields and feeding on carrion in the middle of the road. Fagan said they congregate on Canadarago in double-digit numbers at ice-out time in the spring.

Also by the way the Franklin Mountain Hawkwatch – just across the Susquehanna River from Oneonta – officially began last weekend. You can see bald eagles golden eagles and many other raptors up there depending on the season. Broad-winged hawks already have been migrating. Visitors are always welcome and official counters appreciate help spotting birds. Dress warmly in layers. It can be much colder up there than you think it is going to be.

The best times to be at the hawkwatch are when winds are strong from the northwest and especially after a rain and the passing of a cold front. Information including detailed directions is available at https://doas.us/research/franklin-mountain-hawkwatch/.

I received several other emails of note:

For example in regard to a column on garden pests and how to deal with them Sue Fellows suggested an electric fence. She and her husband put up a three-strand solar fence with components from Tractor Supply and a Gallagher charger bought on line. Sue said it was easy to install. She sent photos of the garden which looks great and has not been molested by critters.

Anthony Salerno wrote to share his experience with his very large garden. He has a picket fence that keeps out larger animals and he doesn’t weed and feed his backyard leaving plenty of clover that he says keeps the woodchucks and squirrels fat and happy. He doesn’t plant lettuce kale Brussel sprouts of any type of cabbage because he has found nothing that works at preventing them being ravaged. He moves owl decoys around the garden which seems to keep the crows at bay. Strawberries and blueberries have wire fencing over them to keep the birds and rabbits away and he has so many blackberries that he lets the animals have their fill. He said everything else including herbs usually is undisturbed and left alone.

In response to a column about invasive species Donald Beier wrote to tell me his experience in dealing with Japanese knotweed at a campground he belonged on the West Branch of the Delaware River. Everything was tried and nothing worked until it was decided to tarp the weeds. They were cut down to ground level and then tarps were placed over the roots. It took several years of what he described as diligent consistent effort but the knotweed disappeared and native foliage returned.

Also on knotweed Ross Cohn informed me that it is edible. Well as a veteran forager of dandelions cardoons (burdock) mustard greens leeks black walnuts and the like I should have expected that to be so but really I was stunned by that news. Ross suggested that as terribly invasive as the weed is making it into a feature in the kitchen might be a great way to control its spread.

In a posting from 2016 bonappetit.com reported that some restaurants were serving knotweed. Maybe it was a fad that since has faded but I’m thinking it probably still is a thing in certain big city establishments.

Here is what bonappetit.com had to say:

“Knotweed’s one redeeming quality then is that its hollow green stems segmented like bamboo and freckled with crimson taste a whole lot like rhubarb (though the two bear no relation). They are tart crunchy and juicy; can be eaten raw or cooked; and can lean sweet or savory depending on how they’re prepared. So knotweed is in many ways the perfect thing to forage: It tastes good it’s easy to find and unlike many wild edibles it’s at zero risk of being over-harvested.”

That is for sure.

Farming commodity:

I live on a mixed family farm where my grandfather dad and brother all farm together. We run a 700 ewe composite flock contract rear dairy heifers have a small cereal enterprise and a biomass enterprise producing willow wood chip for renewable energy. Being away in England for the past few years means I don’t spend much time on the farm anymore but I always enjoy helping out whenever I come home during the summer and at Easter when lambing is in full flow!

How did you become involved in farming?

Growing up on a family farm I was lucky enough to be exposed from a young age to agriculture and the importance it plays in feeding the nation. My family has been involved with different agricultural organisations my whole life allowing me to attend many different events and meet lots of interesting people within the agricultural industry and further afield. I have always enjoyed helping out with different jobs around the farm especially those involving working with the sheep but I mostly enjoy working with my family and feeling part of the team!

Carys Martin

At secondary school my interest in the industry and specifically the business side of things grew. This led me to choose Harper to further my studies which has opened many doors for me.

I was a member of Ballywalter Young Farmers Club when I was at school taking part in competitions such as stock judging public speaking group debating and arts festival. These experiences have broadened my knowledge and the skills I learnt have been invaluable standing me in good stead as I went on to university and applying for jobs.

Earliest farming memory:

What personal characteristics did you develop from agriculture?

Patience and perseverance for when things don’t go to plan which happens a lot in farming. Communication at busy times especially lambing when there’s a million things going on at once. The ability to think on my feet and problem solve and most importantly to have a good work ethic which is important in any job you go into.

Life lesson you learnt from farming:

Take each day as it comes. Sometimes it’s easy to get in over your head thinking about what needs to be done long-term. It’s important to just do as much as you can and not get stressed as you can only try your hardest.

What do you enjoy most about the farming lifestyle?

Every day can be different in farming as a farmer can be anything from a plumber electrician mechanic vet or builder all in one day and this versatility keeps the job interesting.

It is no secret that the lifestyle of a farmer presents many problems meaning things rarely run smoothly but there is a great sense of community where everyone is always willing to help each other as at the end of the day they’re probably facing the same problems too.

Finally I enjoy a sense of pride knowing that I am involved with an industry that plays such an irreplaceable role for the world and as the saying goes ‘you may need a doctor or lawyer once in your life but you need a farmer three times a day!’.

Describe a farmer in three words:

Resilient passionate and hard-working.

What would you like the public to know about NI farming?

Just how much work goes in to making the high-quality products that come from farms. There are so many other elements that go on behind the scenes and now more than ever farmers are constantly under scrutiny from suppliers retailers and consumers to deliver the optimum standards of welfare and quality and doing so in the more economically environmentally and socially sustainable way.

This is just one of the elements reflecting how passionate the individuals in the industry are about their work.

If you could give farmers/farming families/ farming community one piece of advice what would it be?

Keep doing what you’re doing! I think sometimes farmers don’t give themselves the credit they deserve. They tend to be the first to critique themselves and point out the negatives when they do so much important work. This can mean sometimes the job gets very hard but remember you’re not on your own and if you’re struggling share how you’re feeling with someone.

What would you say to others who are considering a career in the agri-industry?

Advertisement

Get stuck in. A career in agriculture doesn’t just mean working in a field or milking cows in a parlour.

There is such a variation of jobs within the sector that most people don’t know are there. The agricultural industry is such an integrated one with so many businesses of all kinds and the ability to network is amazing so the opportunities are there you just need to jump right in and get them.

What are your hopes for the future of Northern Ireland’s agriculture industry?

That the sector continues to remain competitive in producing high quality food while striving to meet challenging environmental targets. Also that young people continue to become involved in the industry and maintain the passionate attitudes of current farmers.

Not available in all states

The latest Consumer Price Index report showed that prices are rising for car insurance. If rising prices are eating into your budget it may be time to find a budget-friendly auto insurance provider that can help ease some of inflation’s sting.

Whether you’re adding a teen driver to your policy or grabbing car coverage with a clean driving record Travelers offers auto insurance rates that are hundreds below the national average. That makes it an attractive option as prices continue to rise in the US thanks to inflation. But how does quality hold up in light of those cheap rates? That’s what we’re here to answer.

One of the largest insurers in the US Travelers is a carrier that’s been around for more than 165 years. With that much experience Travelers is a giant in the insurance business with a robust list of car insurance coverage options to prove it. Travelers auto insurance is available in 42 states plus Washington DC and it offers a great list of coverage at affordable prices. Moreover the carrier has an extensive repertoire of insurance products that make the company a viable option beyond car insurance including pet jewelry and travel insurance.

That said the carrier does raise a couple of red flags when it comes to customer care. Ultimately deciding if Travelers car insurance is right for you is about the balance between quality and price.

Here’s our review of Travelers car insurance for 2022.

Pros of Travelers car insurance

Travelers is a budget-friendly option for car insurance.

Not only are premiums low compared with the national average but a robust list of discounts can help bring your overall costs down even further.

And these low prices don’t mean you’ll skimp on coverage. Travelers has a large list of coverage options you can pick from including some that can’t be found with other insurers like gap insurance rideshare coverage (only in Colorado and Illinois) and an accident forgiveness add-on.

Cons of Travelers car insurance

Travelers doesn’t service every state in the US. If you’re in Alaska Louisiana Michigan South Dakota West Virginia Wyoming Hawaii or North Dakota you won’t be able to purchase a Travelers policy.

Customers who do buy Travelers policies seem typically underwhelmed with the service they receive according to J.D. Power surveys. Whether it’s overall satisfaction digital service experience or satisfaction with the auto claims process Travelers receives lower numbers than the industry average.

Travelers car insurance cost

Whether you’re purchasing a full coverage policy with all the bells and whistles or a minimum coverage policy Travelers can likely save you money.

Tack on a lengthy list of discounts you may qualify for and you’re likely to keep some extra money in your pocket while you drive. Likewise you can save money with Travelers when purchasing minimum coverage -- just the amount required to legally drive in your state – though we recommend opting for more coverage when possible.

PIP may also include coverage for funeral expenses and essential services like childcare or dog-walking that you may be unable to perform due to physical injuries. PIP is in 14 states. Uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage : This coverage pays for medical expenses for yourself and any passengers up to the policy’s limits when an uninsured or underinsured motorist causes an accident. Insurance carriers are required to offer this coverage in all states but the consumer may have the option to decline the coverage. Uninsured motorist property damage is available in some states to help cover repairs to your vehicle if damaged by an uninsured driver. Several states even require this coverage as part of the state’s minimum insurance requirements to drive.

Medical payments : Similar to PIP coverage medical payments help cover the medical costs of the policyholder and their passengers up to the policy limit regardless of fault. However unlike PIP medical payments coverage does not cover lost wages or essential services. Med Pay is optional coverage in most states but required in a few states.

: Roadside assistance coverage helps you if you’re stranded because of car trouble (for example a flat tire or a dead battery). Rideshare coverage : Only available in Colorado and Illinois for Travelers customers. This coverage is essential if you’re working for rideshare companies such as Uber or Lyft. In fact your personal auto policy probably won’t cover you while you’re driving for a rideshare company meaning you must purchase this coverage to be protected. Though rideshare companies have insurance policies that cover you partially there are gaps that could leave you without insurance protection. That’s where rideshare coverage comes in. For example if your rideshare app is on but you have not yet picked up a passenger your rideshare company’s insurance policy will typically only include bodily injury and property damage liability insurance. It’s not until you pick up a passenger that services like Uber and Lyft will pick up the tab for damage done to your car. But with rideshare insurance you’ll be covered the entire time you work.

Travelers scored lower than the industry average on auto claims satisfaction according to another J.D. Power survey. Travelers scored 871 out of 1000 compared with an industry average of 880. Lastly Travelers is toward the tail end in J.D. Power’s digital service experience survey scoring 674 out of 1000 compared with a segment average of 705.

However Travelers fares better when it comes to national complaints. For its auto insurance product line Travelers also receives fewer complaints than the industry average according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’s complaint index. The carrier is indexed at 1.50 compared with a 1.00 industry average. (A 2.00 index would mean a company gets twice the complaints.)

Telematics program

Travelers’ telematics program is called IntelliDrive. It’s a 90-day program that uses your smartphone and an app to track your driving habits including the time of day you drive speed acceleration and braking. It also tracks “distractions” meaning it checks if you’re answering calls texting or interacting with your phone while driving. By enrolling in this program you can score an initial discount and at your next renewal you may be rewarded for safe driving with up to 30% discount off your policy.

Other features we like

Like many other carriers Travelers doesn’t just offer car insurance. And it offers much more than your typical national insurance provider. From boat home renters and condo insurance to pet jewelry travel and wedding insurance Travelers really has it all making it an easy one-stop-shop for anything you may need to insure.

Methodology

Consumer complaints are taken from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) which collects consumer complaints across states indexing complaints on a scale that takes into account the industry average. We collect the financial strength rating of each carrier from the A.M. Best Rating. Lastly we collected collision repair scores from the Crash Network Insurer Report Card which collects data from collision repair professionals including mechanics to gauge the quality of collision claims service from insurance carriers.

OLD SAYBROOK Conn. — Travelers are flocking to the Connecticut shoreline to enjoy the lobster rolls and be by the water this Labor Day weekend. It's known as the unofficial end of summer and brings a boost for seasonal businesses.

Seafood restaurant Abbot’s Lobster In the Rough in Noank was a busy spot Friday afternoon as early travelers poured in for the weekend.

Mike Torre and his wife came out to the shoreline from Wallingford.

“It’s a beautiful day. It’s nice out. Temperatures are good. That’s it. We’re happy to enjoy the day"" Torre said. “We’ve already been out boating and now Abbot's for a lobster roll.”

The lobster rolls steamed mussels and clam chowder were the hot items on the menu for visitors but the main star was the lobster dinners.

“It’s definitely one of the busiest weekends of the year” said Chelsea Leonard Owner of Abbott's. ”We’re prepped up we’ve gotten our deliveries in and we’ll be getting lobsters in every day throughout the weekend.”

It's an important weekend for seasonal shoreline businesses like Abbott’s as summer wraps up. They’re open from May to October.

“It’s been a great summer here. We’ve been busy. The staffing situation is a bit better than last year. Still could be better but we’ve seen some improvements"" Leonard said.

After this weekend Leonard said Abbot's will go to weekends only and will stay open until Columbus Day.

Road trippers are feeling less pain at the pump this holiday weekend; gas prices are at $3.59 in Old Saybrook down 75 cents from the Connecticut average one month ago according to data from AAA.

International travel hubs in Indonesia Australia Canada and Sweden led the list of airports with the most delays by afternoon but US airports were catching up according to flight tracking site Flight Aware.

Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson Airport reported 50 delays and five cancellations the site said — followed in the US by New York’s JFK Airport which reported 38 delays as of 2:30 p.m.

Overall 1345 flights had been delayed within into or out of the US the site said and another 157 canceled.

Turkish Airlines reported 628 delays more than any other airline. Delta and American Airlines reported the most delays of any US carriers — 197 and 179 respectively.

The flight frustrations come after more than 3600 US flights were delayed Saturday.

It predicted that it will be the busiest Labor Day travel weekend in three years Fox Weather reported.

On Thursday the Department of Transportation said it launched an airline customer service dashboard prompting “significant changes” from all but one of the 10 largest US airlines.

“Passengers deserve transparency and clarity on what to expect from an airline when there is a cancellation or disruption” Transportation Sec. Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. “This dashboard collects that information in one place so travelers can easily understand their rights compare airline practices and make informed decisions.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYWRkbGV5b3Vyb3dua2Fub28uY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDQvaGF3YWlpYW4tYWlybGluZXMtaXMtYmVpbmctc3VlZC1mb3ItY29udHJhY3QtYnJlYWNoLWJlY2F1c2UtaXQtYWRkZWQtYS03LXN1cmNoYXJnZS10by1jZXJ0YWluLWJvb2tpbmdzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hawaiian Airlines is Being Sued for Contract Breach Because it Added a $7 Surcharge to Certain Bookings,"Hawaiian Airlines is being sued by the maker of one of the largest travel reservation systems in the world because the carrier has allegedly breached a “heavily negotiated” contract in a “calculated strategy” to renegotiate the agreement.

Sabre Global Technologies filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York last week alleging that Hawaiian’s actions have had “ripple effects throughout the travel distribution ecosystem” and cost the company “substantially more” than $75000 in lost profits.

Originally developed by American Airlines and IBM in the 1960s Sabre was spun off into an independent global distribution system or GDS in the 70s. Sabre’s GDS acts as an intermediary between airlines hotels and car rental companies and more than 425000 travel agents around the world.

The GDS allow travel agents and consumers to search compare and book travel but travel companies have to pay to be part of the GDS and Sabre can take a cut of any booking made through its system.

In May Hawaiian suddenly stopped listing its inter-island flights on Sabre and added a $7 surcharge on any flight booked through Sabre.

But Hawaiian offered travel agents an alternative. Rather than using Sabre travel agents are being encouraged to access its proprietary HAChannel+ program that uses a new standard developed by the airline industry called New Distribution Capability (NDC).

NDC has been developed by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to “transform the way air products are retailed to corporations leisure and business travelers”. In July for example Hawaiian struck a deal with Priceline to sell airfares via HAChannel+ rather than through a traditional GDS.

The heavily redacted lawsuit however alleges that by removing certain routes from the GDS and adding a surcharge Hawaiian has breached its contract with Sabre and that has put its business at a competitive disadvantage.

Sabre is one of three major GDS suppliers who have come to control the way airfares are sold but new technology is challenging their business. In particular airlines want to embrace tech that allows them to market important features like WiFi availability as well as distinguishing restrictive fares like Basic Economy.

Traditional GDS systems have struggled to handle all this additional information because they were built in a time when the only information that was required was the fare and travel class.

Airlines have rebuilt their websites to display and sell ancillary products but many consumers who rely on third-party websites to book travel don’t always get the full picture of what’s available or what restrictions have been placed on their tickets. NDC hopes to change that."

'Narco' has become synonymous with Mets' closer Edwin Diaz who runs out to the song whenever he enters a game. The song has quickly become one of the most iconic reliever entrances in baseball history.

Last week the song's artist Timmy Trumpet played the song live as Diaz entered the game in the Mets' win over the Dodgers at Citi Field.

The Braves' DJ trolled the Mets following their loss which is on-brand for Truist Park employees.

In Bryce Harper's final year of his contract with the Washington Nationals in 2018 the Braves' organist played Steve Goodman's 'Go Cubs Go' as Harper walked up to the plate amid rumors that Harper would leave the Nationals as a free agent to sign with the Cubs.

With the Mets losing two of three at home to the lowly Nationals and the Braves sweeping the Miami Marlins the Braves are now just one game back of the Mets' lead in the National League East with four and a half weeks remaining in the regular season.

The Mets have not spent a single day out of first place since April 11. Entering play June 2 the Mets had a 10.5 game-lead over the division's next closest team: the Atlanta Braves.

Since then the Mets have gone 50-33. The Braves have simply been better. The Braves are 61-24 over the same stretch.

The two clubs have one series remaining and it lands on the final weekend of the season in Atlanta.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9mYW5uYXRpb24vbWxiL2Zhc3RiYWxsL25ld3MvYXRsYW50YS1icmF2ZXMtbWF4LWZyaWVkLWxvc2VzLW5vLWhpdC1iaWQtc3VuZGF5LXRvLXJhaW4tZGVsYXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Atlanta Braves' Max Fried Loses No-Hit Bid Sunday to... Rain Delay,"Atlanta Braves' starting pitcher Max Fried did not allow a hit over five innings but had his no-hit bid upended Sunday by a rain delay midway through the Braves' 7-1 victory over the Miami Marlins at Truist Park.

Atlanta Braves' starting pitcher Max Fried did not allow a hit through the first five innings of Sunday's game against the Miami Marlins at Truist Park.

The 28-year-old lefty was attempting to become the first Braves' pitcher to throw a no-hitter since Kent Mercker did April 8 1994 against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium.

Fried was the second Braves' pitcher chasing franchise history over the last four days as teammate Spencer Strider set a franchise record for strikeouts in a single game Thursday night passing a mark previously held by Hall of Famer John Smoltz.

Fried cruised through five no-hit innings allowing no runs walking one and striking out six on 66 pitches.

Then a rain delay stopped Fried in his tracks. An hour and 35 minutes later the game resumed but Fried's day was done. Braves' manager Brian Snitker chose not to give the ball back to his starting pitcher ending his no-hit bid.

It's rare for a starting pitcher to return to the mound after a rain delay after throwing 60-plus pitches.

Perhaps a pitcher will come back after a rain delay in an elimination game but in the case of the Braves who already had a 2-0 lead over a weak Marlins team Snitker wisely chose not to push it.

""That's the first time I ever remember coming out of a game without giving up a hit"" Fried told reporters after Sunday's game.

The Braves beat the Marlins 7-1 improving the club's record to 84-51.

With the Mets losing Sunday the Braves are now just one game back of their National League East division-lead.

Along with that the Joey McGuire era is underway as Texas Tech hosted Murray State in the home opener Saturday night at Jones AT&T Stadium.

Thanks to a revamped offense orchestrated by former Frenship standout Zach Kittley the Red Raiders ensured their first-year head coach rang in his tenure with a 63-10 victory.

The start didn’t seem ideal as the offense started from its own 5-yard line after a miscue on a punt return saw Adrian Frye collect the ball near the end zone before maneuvering his way out of danger.

First play in the Red Raiders executed a flea-flicker to get the crowd razzed up and continued that momentum as Tyler Shough completed a 45-yard touchdown pass to Loic Fouonji putting Texas Tech up 7-0 at the 10:34 mark of the first quarter.

The only downside was that Shough left the game at the end of the first quarter.

Late in the first quarter Shough kept the ball for 17 yards on a designed run and was brought down by Jaylon Bolden a 208-pound safety. Shough stayed in through the end of the quarter but put a hand to his left shoulder a few times at the end of plays.

Five plays after he landed hard on his left shoulder the same one in which he suffered a season-ending injury last year. He was replaced by Donovan Smith a former Frenship standout who was named the Offensive MVP of the Liberty Bowl last season.

Smith kept things humming as he orchestrated the offense to 28 points ensuring the Red Raiders finished with scores on all six of their first-half possessions.

Shough returned to the game sporting a sling on his left arm along with shorts a red T-shirt and a cap.

Smith ended the night going 14-for-16 for 221 yards and four touchdowns before Behren Morton was called in to get some reps at the quarterback spot.

The top wideout was Jerand Bradley who made six catches for 108 yards and two touchdowns. Loic Fouonji chipped in 77 yards and two scores on four catches.

Tahj Brooks led the tailbacks with six carries for 50 yards and three touchdowns.

Shough hit Loic Fouonji for the first touchdown of the season before letting running back Tahj Brooks do his thing for another 6. But Shough's hot start flamed out before the end of the 1st quarter.

During a quarterback draw Shough pulled away from the pocket and darted toward the Racers' sideline. Instead of sliding to his knees he was brought down hard by Murray State tacklers. While it's unclear if this specific play caused Shough's injury a couple of miffed passes later in the drive lend credence to that theory.

As of the publication of this story the extent of Shough's injury is unknown. It's possible we'll hear more during the post-game press conference.

Donovan Smith took over for Shough in the 2nd quarter. Smith led the Red Raiders through several games in 2021 after Shough missed the final eight games of that season following a broken collar bone. In 2021 Smith secured the Red Raiders' 6th win of the season against Iowa State plus a Liberty Bowl win over Mississippi State. He opened the 2nd quarter against Murray State with a 30-yard touchdown pass to Jerand Bradley. On his second drive of the game Smith led a one-play touchdown drive with a 39-yard touchdown pass to Fouonji his second of the game.

28 People in the Lubbock County Detention Center on September 2nd 2022",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlL3RleGFzLXRlY2gvbmV3cy9yZWQtcmFpZGVycy12cy1tdXJyYXktc3RhdGUtcmFjZXJzLXR5bGVyLXNob3VnaC1pbmp1cmVkLWluanVyeS1odXJ0LXJldHVybi11cGRhdGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Red Raiders QB Tyler Shough Out With Injury,"Quarterback Tyler Shough and the Red Raiders were putting on quite a show. Tech scored 14 points on their first two drives of the game largely in part to the arm of Shough.

The first touchdown of the season came on a 45-yard pass from Shough to wideout Loic Fouonji that ended a four-play 94-yard drive after the Red Raiders were backed up at their own four yard line to start the series.

Running back Tahj Brooks scored a rushing touchdown on the very next drive on a 14-yard scamper to the right side. On those two drives Shough completed four-of-five passes for 125 yards and the lone touchdown.

The third series is where something went wrong for Shough.

On what appeared to be a quarterback draw Shough ran toward the Racers' sideline where he was brought down hard by a number of Murray State defenders. It's not clear if this play caused the injury but Shough wasn't the same after completing two-of-four passes for just 29 yards before being replaced by Donovan Smith.

Smith immediately hit Jarand Bradley for a 30-yard touchdown play and on his second possession Smith led a one-play touchdown drive with a 39-yard touchdown pass to Fouonji.

Smith and incoming freshman Behran Morton will finish the game while Shough is on the sideline in street clothes with his left arm in a sling.

We should hear more about Shough's injury in the post-game press conference.

Last season after Shough was lost with a broken collar bone in Week 4 against the Longhorns Smith led the Red Raiders through the final eight games plus a Liberty Bowl win over Mississippi State.

Coca-Cola Co. McDonald’s Corp. Starbucks Corp. Yum! Brands Inc. and Papa John’s International Inc. to the growing list of companies suspending some operations in Russia over that country’s invasion of Ukraine.

Ramon Laguarta chief executive officer of PepsiCo Inc. Purchase NY said in an email to employees on March 8 that the company would suspend the sale of beverages like Pepsi Cola 7UP and Mirinda as well as capital investments and all advertising in Russia.

“As a food and beverage company now more than ever we must stay true to the humanitarian aspect of our business” Laguarta wrote. “That means we have a responsibility to continue to offer our other products in Russia including daily essentials such as milk and other dairy offerings baby formula and baby food. By continuing to operate we will also continue to support the livelihoods of our 20000 Russian associates and the 40000 Russian agricultural workers in our supply chain as they face significant challenges and uncertainty ahead.”

Laguarta added that PepsiCo has suspended operations in Ukraine and is working to provide aid to Ukrainian refugees in neighboring countries through donations to aid agencies and the ramping up of production at other PepsiCo manufacturing plants in Europe.

The Coca-Cola Co. Atlanta released a brief statement March 8 that it was “suspending its businesses” in Russia but did not provide details.

McDonald’s temporarily will close all its restaurants in Russia and pause all operations in that market according to an email sent March 8 by Chris Kempczinski CEO to employees and franchises.

On the same day Kevin Johnson president and CEO of Starbucks wrote employees saying the company was suspending all business activity in Russia. The company has approximately 130 locations in the country.

“Our licensed partner has agreed to immediately pause store operations and will provide support to the nearly 2000 partners in Russia who depend on Starbucks for their livelihood” he wrote.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine also drew a reaction from Yum! Brands. The owner of the KFC Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands suspended all investment and restaurant development in Russia.

In Russia McDonald’s at the end of 2021 had 847 restaurants with 84% operated by the company. The chain had 108 in Ukraine all operated by the company. The two countries accounted for 2% of McDonald’s systemwide sales in 2021.

“We understand the impact this will have on our Russian colleagues and partners which is why we are prepared to support all three legs of the stool in Ukraine and Russia” Kempczinksi said of restaurants closing in Russia. “This includes salary continuation for all McDonald’s employees in Russia.”

Chicago-based McDonald’s also is paying full salaries to Ukrainian employees has donated $5 million to an employee assistance fund and is supporting relief efforts by the International Red Cross.

“Across the rest of Europe we will stay focused on how McDonald’s can best help those in need both now and in the future” Kempczinski said. “We have already seen extraordinary leadership by our Ukrainian and Russian teams and I know the rest of the McDonald’s system stands ready to support the large number of refugees who have been displaced by this conflict.

“As we move forward McDonald’s will continue to assess the situation and determine if any additional measures are required. At this juncture it’s impossible to predict when we might be able to reopen our restaurants in Russia. We are experiencing disruptions to our supply chain along with other operational impacts. We will also closely monitor the humanitarian situation.”

Louisville Ky.-based Yum! has about 1000 KFC restaurants and 50 Pizza Hut locations in Russia. Independent operators run nearly all the restaurants under license or franchise agreements. Yum! is donating $1 million to the Red Cross is activating a disaster relief fund to support Ukrainian franchise employees and is matching donations from employees to charities providing relief in Ukraine.

“McDonald’s and other fast-food outlets are under pressure to withdraw from the Russian market” said Ramsey Baghdadi a consumer analyst for GlobalData March 8. “However this is easier said than done for the fast-food industry. Russia represents approximately 0.7% of the global fast-food restaurant’s value in 2020. Such a small proportion of value generation in Russia tells us that fears of losing sales is not the main factor at play here.

“The challenge that foodservice providers have is the very nature of their business model. Fast-food chains such as McDonald’s and KFC often have complicated agreements with their outlets as a large proportion of them are franchises and are not enterprises. So it becomes a much more challenging negotiation to completely stop operations compared to other industries.”

A GlobalData consumer survey released in March showed consumer concern for social causes however.

“As 72% of consumer purchases are driven by a brand’s ethics or support shown toward a social cause it becomes difficult for these companies to balance consumer expectations and their operational needs putting pressure on international fast-food restaurants” Baghdadi said.

On March 9 Louisville Ky.-based Papa John’s International added itself to the list of corporations suspending operations in Russia.

The brand committed to providing aid and is actively supporting humanitarian efforts through financial contributions and the donation of dry goods and ingredients to feed refugees in Eastern Europe through a partnership with World Central Kitchen.

Papa John’s suspended all corporate operations in Russia and stopped all operational marketing and business support to and engagement with the Russian market. Papa John’s International does not own or operate any restaurants in Russia. Its Russian restaurants are all owned by independent franchisees and a master franchisee who controls operations and provides all supplies and ingredients for the restaurants through a supply chain that it owns and operates.

Papa John’s International is not currently receiving any royalties from these franchised stores in Russia.

Like much of the world Papa John’s condemns aggression and violence and hopes for a peaceful resolution to the crisis in Ukraine the company said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvc2VwLzA0L2Nhc2gtZGlzcGFyaXR5LWFuLW9taW5vdXMtc2lnbi1mb3Itam9uZXMtcmFjZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cash disparity an ominous sign for Jones' race | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"



Two months shy of election day Republican and former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders reports heaps of campaign cash on hand $6.3 million to finance her final stretch in the Arkansas governor's race.

Democrat Chris Jones -- physicist political newcomer and long shot in a red Southern state -- claims barely a pocketful by comparison $118800.

Eyeing the numbers some Republican political observers question whether the Jones campaign can keep the lights on much less get his name in front of voters between now and Nov. 8.

A Little Rock political consultant who has run two Arkansas Republican governors' campaigns Jon Gilmore believes the Jones campaign has spent too much too early what he calls a ""fatal mistake.""

Now in the closing weeks ""They can't tell the voters who they are and what they stand for"" he said.

Jones campaign manager Rhonna-Rose Akama-Makia said her candidate faced an expensive start-up but has raised enough overall so far nearly $2.6 million to compete. She added that he will have enough on hand to continue meeting voters.

Meantime ""payroll still goes through rent still gets paid"" Akama-Makia said. ""We're confident with our numbers that we're on track with our goals to run our race.""

Sanders' staffers declined to talk about the campaign contribution gap. Neither Sanders nor Jones was available to be interviewed for this article. In a statement Sanders expressed appreciation for ""generous support.""

Political watchers from both parties say that based on past campaigns contribution money on hand will dictate how the rest of the 2022 Arkansas governor race plays out.

Both candidates will ask for votes but will have different options for how to do that.

Sanders will find it easy to load up media time and pay for consultants travel and other expenses according to former campaign managers and candidates. Her campaign already has spent $9.7 million of almost $16 million total raised so far according to the most recent available campaign finance disclosure reports.

Jones who has spent $2.5 million of the $2.6 million total he's raised will likely struggle to buy TV and expensive media messaging according to campaign experts. Instead he will travel the state and shake hands at public events and front-porch fundraisers.

Jim Keet the 2010 Republican candidate for governor knows from experience that a large stash of contribution dollars in a campaign's final weeks decides a lot.

""The old saying is that money is the mother's milk of politics"" Keet said. ""It's very difficult in this age to compete if you don't have adequate funds to do so.""

A former state senator and restaurateur Keet reported $47441 on hand before Labor Day for his 2010 gubernatorial race. Arkansas leaned Democrat then. The popular incumbent Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe had $3 million.

Early in the Keet campaign his team spent on production and television while hoping for large-donor help from Republican groups. The money didn't materialize.

By the final weeks ""we didn't have the financial wherewithal to do media and large blocks of advertising"" he said. ""So I was in every part of the state every day. It's more hand-to-hand combat -- going to functions to gatherings people would orchestrate for me.""

In nine months of campaigning Keet says he took six days off. He lost to Beebe whom he considers a friend 64% to 34%.

BACKING 'SUCCESS'

In political campaigns ""people want to support someone who is likely to succeed"" said Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce President Randy Zook. ""They're not likely to throw good money around where they don't have a chance at success.""

Sanders has captured in-state and out-of-state donors big-money donors and political action committees (PACs) connected with businesses and other groups according to campaign contribution disclosure data for the Arkansas governor's race so far.

PACs representing interests including Walmart Tyson Foods real estate agents pharmacists and eye doctors have combined to give about $208000 to Sanders' campaign so far. All campaign finance contribution data for this article is from candidates' reports from 2021 through Aug. 15 filings with the Arkansas secretary of state.

Jones' reports show less than $1000 from PACs and special interests.

Zook said business owners like Sanders' support for workforce improvements such as better education and training for future workers. And they approve of her promises to cut taxes -- ""a wide range of taxes not just income taxes"" he said.

""Look Chris [Jones] has been a good candidate"" Zook said. ""He's an appealing fellow a heck of a personality. He's obviously bright. But today's political divide in Arkansas is pretty stark. The issues that resonate with most Arkansas voters are the ones the Republicans are effectively delivering. And that reflects the national mood as well.""

Sanders also is far ahead in contributions from both Arkansans and out-of-staters with more than half of her campaign donations coming from people who live outside Arkansas according to campaign finance disclosure data.

The Sanders campaign has received more than $7.6 million so far from donors in other states or about 57% of her total among donors listed by name and address in campaign contribution data. (State rules don't require candidates to identify donors of less than $50.) Her in-state contributions are at almost $5.8 million.

Jones has received almost $900000 from out-of-state donors or about 46% of his contributions from identified donors. Contributors with Arkansas addresses have given a little over $1 million.

For perspective Sanders' $7.6 million in out-of-state money with at least two months of fundraising left in the race is more than any past Arkansas gubernatorial candidate has raised in total contributions for an entire campaign according to news reports and political observers.

The reasons behind Sanders' out-of-state money political experts and donors say include her national profile as White House press secretary for President Donald Trump with her face and statements broadcast frequently in national news reports. She also profits from Trump's endorsement and the continued national presence of her father former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee who ran for president in 2008.

After Arkansans Floridians are among her largest contributors at just more than $1 million. Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence is there and Sanders' parents moved back to Arkansas from Florida in December 2020.

Jones' largest contributions outside Arkansas have come from California $182000 and Massachusetts $119800. Jones lived 15 years in Massachusetts and made many contacts there his campaign said while he earned a master's degree in nuclear engineering and a doctorate in urban planning at the Massachusetts Institute for Technology in Cambridge.

Big-money donors in and out of Arkansas also have stacked up for Sanders.

Arkansas' campaign contribution limits currently are $2900 per candidate per race. That means the most generous donor could give a governor's candidate this year $2900 for the primary election and $2900 for the general election. To look at big donors the Democrat-Gazette examined contributions of $2500 and up.

Sanders lists $5.5 million from those largest donors or 34.6% of all campaign contributions.

Jones reports $299575 or about 11.6% of his total.

To examine the candidates' fundraising the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette analyzed more than 100000 lines of campaign contribution data since 2021 for Sanders Jones and Libertarian candidate Ricky Harrington the three names on the ballot for Arkansas governor in November. The data can be downloaded from the Arkansas secretary of state's campaign finance disclosure system.

Harrington has reported Aug. 15 raising about $31705 in total contributions with $14581 on hand.

About the funding divide with Sanders he wrote in a text: ""The obvious challenge is that I do not have excess capital to spend on political marketing and other typical media products.""

STRUGGLE FOR CASH

Grant Tennille started his job as Arkansas Democratic Party chairman last October after Sanders and Jones announced their bids for governor. He's been fundraising ever since.

""It is incredibly difficult for Democrats to raise money in Arkansas"" he said. ""I am turned down a lot more often than I am given a donation. There are fewer standing up saying 'I am a Democrat.'""

Against this backdrop Jones is the first Black candidate to be nominated by a major party to run for governor in Arkansas which comes with its own fundraising challenges Tennille said.

Tennille acknowledges that in politics ""If you bet on the person who raises the most money you're going to win most of the time.""

Nevertheless Tennille said what he and Jones talk about is: ""You can't worry about her money. What you've got to do is raise the money to run the race that you want to run.""

""If he can get there he's going to wind up happy proud and hopefully successful in the end"" Tennille said.

Tennille remains hopeful that fundraising will improve for his candidate. When Tennille called contacts this summer he said they told him August is slow but: ""Call me back in September. There's money in the ground for Chris that will start picking up.""

'FORCES STACKED'

""David versus Goliath doesn't seem adequate"" to describe the divide in campaign contributions between major party candidates in this year's Arkansas' governors race said Janine Parry University of Arkansas at Fayetteville political science professor.

But she says it reflects the climate in Arkansas and the country.

Campaign money started ""exploding in the early 2000s. The pace continues unabated"" she said. ""It's about money and polarization and the return of one-party monopolies.""

""A lot of states are headed in this direction"" said Parry who's writing a book on the topic. And not just Republican-leaning states: ""We're seeing it in Massachusetts California Hawaii Vermont that are every bit as blue as red states are red.""

Arkansas now is not unlike its first 140 years she said. ""The off-brand candidates which were Republicans and now are Democrats will do really well to exceed 38% of the statewide vote. It will have very little to do with qualifications. It will have to do with resources and brand. And those are so intermingled they are the same thing.""

Along with the divide in campaign contributions researchers see widening splits in average vote margins measured in high-profile statewide Arkansas races she said.

The average vote gap between major parties in the Arkansas governor lieutenant governor attorney general and secretary of state races in 2014 averaged 17 points; by 2018 it was 29 points Parry said.

This election year she won't be surprised to see a 40-point gap.

""It's real hard for even a candidate of excellent credentials -- not political credentials but a well-qualified charismatic candidate -- to get any traction in this climate"" Parry said. ""It's Jones' cross to bear that he's thrown his hat in the ring when all of those forces are so stacked against him.""

POSITION TO WIN

Little Rock strategist Gilmore campaign manager for Hutchinson's 2014 campaign and chief strategist for his 2018 re-election says he would have set aside more of Democrat Jones' $2.6 million in campaign contributions for use in the last few weeks of this year's campaign.

In 2014 against then-Democratic Congressman Mike Ross Hutchinson raised about $4 million to Ross's $6 million Gilmore said in an email. ""What I did was conserve resources to match Ross on television. I thought it important as a campaign manager to ensure that my candidate have the resources to compete on television to put us in position to win.""

About this year's governor's race ""I've never seen the momentum for a candidate that Sarah Sanders has"" Gilmore said. ""But people aren't just in love with Republicans. You have to run an effective campaign and that is what she and her team are doing.""

Jones campaign manager Akama-Makia said her candidate faced a challenging and high-cost startup with the state Democratic Party in a ""regrowing"" phase since losing control of the legislature and statewide offices by 2014.

""It's been a while"" since Democrats have been organized Akama-Makia said. ""We had to prepare our own structure for this cycle"" which cost money.

Democrat and former Gov. Beebe said Jones was at a big disadvantage at the start of the campaign because of Sanders' national recognition and affiliation with Trump who carried Arkansas by 61% in 2016 and 62% in 2020.

""All you can do is keep fighting and keep working go to as many events shake as many hands as possible"" Beebe said. ""When you don't have money you have to make it a personal appearance and hard-work campaign. I think Chris Jones is doing that.""

Beebe says Arkansans have always favored ""retail politics"" in this ""big-enough small-enough"" state.

""In Arkansas the voters expect to see you"" he said. ""They have a history of wanting to touch and see the candidates. [Former Democratic Gov. and President Bill] Clinton was a master at that.""

Win or lose there's merit to voters' hearing multiple points of view says former gubernatorial candidate Keet.

People have asked why he decided to run in a Democratic state in 2010 against incumbent Beebe then rated one of the nation's most popular governors.

""Without competition our system dies"" Keet said. ""In the absence of good competing ideas you don't have good government.""

Her work involved long days physically demanding tasks and repetitive motions. After handling a knife for 10 hours she’d come home tired and sore pulling off her shoes with aching hands. It was hard work she said — but that’s not what bothered her about her job.

Vega Brown said life in those steel windowless plants is worse than she thinks most people know.

This summer the Journal Star interviewed Vega Brown and five current workers from three different Nebraska meatpacking plants. Many utilized a translator. Pseudonyms of the five workers who wished not to be named because they feared losing their jobs are noted with asterisks.

Smithfield allowed the Journal Star to tour its Crete facility and held a roundtable discussion between the reporter and nine Smithfield employees — three corporate employees the general and assistant manager and several plant workers. The plant contributes to Nebraska’s multibillion dollar meat industry processing about 1 million pounds of meat per day and feeding an estimated 30-40 million people every week.

Vega Brown and the anonymous meat processors were introduced to the Journal Star through Nebraska Appleseed an organization that advocates for plant workers and connects with close to 600 meatpackers each year through safety seminars and community partners. The group has been in operation since 1996 helping educate workers about their rights and making the public aware of conditions inside meatpacking plants.

Each of the six meatpacking workers voiced concerns about frequent injuries hazardous working conditions discrimination and harassment in their workplace.

Darcy Tromanhauser program director of immigrants and communities with Nebraska Appleseed said their stories are common.

She believes the meatpacking industry stands in the way of a decades-long hard-fought struggle for meatpacking workers’ rights.

“Over many years so many workers have worked hard to tell this story” Tromanhauser said. “And yet so many people are surprised to hear that this is going on.”

'It’s constant injuries that we have to face'

Every day around 26600 Nebraska workers many of whom are immigrants head to work in meatpacking plants across the state. Vega Brown was one of them.

Work was fast she said. The more tasks they could complete the more money the company made. So the conveyor belt flew.

She recalled a time on the line frantically trying to manage the pork zipping by when a sharp pain shot through her neck.

Vega Brown screamed “Help me! I can’t move.” But her supervisor told her she needed to get back on the line.

“What are you doing? Get back to work!” Vega Brown said imitating the woman with raised arms.

Vega Brown lay on the ground writhing in pain as work continued around her. A few coworkers who stopped to help were scolded by their supervisor. An ambulance was on its way they were told. Nothing to see here.

“For me that was the most dehumanizing thing that’s ever happened to me” she said with tears in her eyes. “Sometimes I think I’ve moved past it but knowing others are still going through the same thing makes it feel as if it’s just happened.”

Vega Brown was hospitalized for three days after her injury. Her plant had a penalty point system that allotted employees 15 points before termination. She received two penalty points for every day she was in the hospital.

When she argued that she shouldn’t have been penalized for being hospitalized her bosses told her it didn’t matter. She wasn’t at work. Six points.

Andy* — a meatpacking worker who’s been employed in Nebraska for nearly two decades — said the industry takes advantage of immigrant employees like himself.

The white-coated workers with knives hurry to keep up often at the expense of injuring themselves.

But Andy’s employers don’t like it when people complain.

“In my experience when people get hurt the company tries to terminate (them)” he said.

So they stay on the line keep quiet and keep cutting. Even if it’s painful.

Have things changed much since he first started? “No” Andy said. “Not really.”

Is there one company that’s better to work for? “It’s all kinda the same” he said.

Why doesn’t he complain? “HR doesn’t do anything.”

Andy said he feels stuck. Life in the plant is grim but opportunities in rural Nebraska for people who don’t speak English fluently are few and far between. So Andy and others keep working hoping one day things will change.

In Sara’s* plant she must finish more than six pieces per minute. The pressure to operate at a machine-like pace is painful and the equipment she uses is old unstable and unsafe she said.

She wishes they could work at a more comfortable speed but supervisors keep things moving moving moving even when the plant is short on staff.

“It's constant injuries that we have to face because of the conditions in the plant” she said. “We all feel defeated but because of the lack of workers we are expected to continue the same production value. If there are people with more time on their hands they're expected to work even harder even though they are beating up their bodies to do it.”

Tim* works at a different plant in Nebraska but he also processes pigs.

On the kill floor Tim said injuries are common. The mechanism that suspends the over 400-pound pigs by their hind feet is transporting them quickly and sometimes things go wrong he said.

He said he’s seen a couple of his coworkers being whisked away to the nurse after a pig fell on top of them.

Tim said that when injured workers are able they keep working out of fear of retaliation but others are taken to the nursing station.

“They'll be given an ibuprofen or something for the pain and they'll just be taken back to the line” he said.

Eric Reeder president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union in Omaha said there are different line speed standards for industries depending on what the product is — line speed is measured differently for pork than it is for chicken beef etc. — but it’s easy for supervisors on the floor to turn the line speed up past a safe rate.

Furthermore what constitutes a safe line speed depends on how many workers are on the line that day. This makes it hard for a standard speed to work well for every plant.

Reeder said he hears complaints of supervisors setting the line speed to an unworkable rate often. At times plants exceed speeds agreed to by the union.

Smithfield however told the Journal Star in a written statement that it’s unlikely workers in their plants are sent back to the line after being injured. Such actions are against the company’s policy.

The company also denies ever going over maximum line speeds. It mentioned its opposition to a USDA-led pilot program to increase line speeds stating it considers worker safety a priority.

“Line speeds at our harvest facilities never exceed the maximum USDA-approved rate of 1106 head per hour” the written statement read. “In fact our line speeds often operate at significantly lower rates based on staffing levels at any given time.”

'They can’t go to the bathroom so they pee their pants'

Several workers told the Journal Star that because of the plants’ urgency to keep the line moving they’re frequently denied bathroom breaks by their employers.

Both Nebraska Appleseed and Reeder said they’ve also heard persistent complaints about lack of bathroom access from workers in Nebraska plants.

“They’re not letting me go to the bathroom” Andy told the Journal Star. He recounted stories of his coworkers’ embarrassment after being unable to wait until the end of the day.

A supervisor told Andy’s team to wear diapers if they couldn’t “hold it.”

“A lot of people pee on the line” he said. “They can’t go to the bathroom so they pee their pants.”

Before Vega Brown could relieve herself she’d have to ask a coworker to cover for her. If someone was able to take over her station time spent on bathroom breaks was taken out of her lunch break.

But Smithfield’s Chief Administrative Officer Kiera Lombardo said employees in the company’s plants are free to relieve themselves whenever they need.

“Nobody is denied access to the restroom” Lombardo said. “Ever.”

Victor* called working conditions in his plant “horrible” and said he had safety concerns.

A few months ago Victor said his plant had an ammonia leak from its refrigeration system but his supervisors didn’t want to stop the line. Instead employees continued to work while their bosses clamored to fix the issue.

According to the Centers for Disease Control ammonia exposure can cause nausea vomiting and burns to the respiratory tract.

“They didn't sound the alarm” Victor said.

'Meatpacking companies are never going to make it to heaven'

According to the USDA Nebraska led the nation in the number of cattle slaughtered in 2021 and ranks sixth in pork slaughter.

At the heart of this massive operation are people like Andy — immigrant workers trying to provide for their families.

Tromanhauser with Nebraska Appleseed said she's heard alarming stories for years. Plants with poor working conditions thrive because workers feel powerless to improve their situation she said.

“It’s an industry with extreme retaliation” Tromanhauser said. “If people even try to just internally raise a safety concern they're told ‘There's the door if you want to leave.’”

Gloria Sarmiento a community organizer with Nebraska Appleseed said abuse in meat processing plants is an industry-wide issue.

“Sometimes when they are telling me a story I want to cry with them” Sarmiento said. “They complain from every company.”

The Nebraska Farmers Union began to work with meatpacking employees after a 2020 investigation by Congress found that meatpacking companies ignored COVID-19 infections in order to continue operating. This coupled with close quarters led to widespread outbreak and death.

Since then John Hansen president of the Nebraska Farmers Union has advocated for the proper care of workers.

Meatpacking plants’ misdeeds are two-fold Hansen said. While their conditions hurt workers packing plants also harm farmers. The companies’ non-competitive practices threaten smaller-scale operations Hansen said leading to more consolidation and fewer farmers.

According to the North American Meat Institute the four largest companies conduct 70% of beef production.

“Based on how they treat workers farmers and ranchers I would say that there's a very good chance that meatpacking companies are never going to make it to heaven” Hansen said.

Reeder and the United Food and Commercial Workers Union which represents around 12000 plant workers in Nebraska strive to create fair contracts between the workers and employers.

Plant workers act as stewards and report to the union when there have been contract violations such as line speeds intimidation or abuse.

However Reeder said unionizing the plants is sometimes a challenge. Around 75% of plant members must be in favor of joining before the union will get involved and there’s often pushback from plants once they hear whispers of unionizing.

It’s not uncommon for plant heads to call meetings and tell workers not to speak with the union. They’ll threaten to close the plant if it becomes unionized or they’ll misinform workers about the cost of union dues.

Reeder said some supervisors will tell workers that if they’re caught talking to the union they’ll be fired which is illegal. But many of the immigrant employees don't know their rights and don't always understand how unions could be beneficial he said.

“Organizing a union gives you a voice and a sense of fairness in the workplace” Reeder said. “The company would rather have the convenience to do what they want.”

Reeder said one of the most common issues the union faces between plants and workers is proper payment.

He hears complaints of workers not receiving correct payment several times a week. Reeder believes the companies take advantage of the fact that a large portion of its workforce might not speak English fluently.

“Figuring out if you are paid properly is difficult” Reeder said. “If English is not your first language it's impossible.”

He said errors in payroll from plants across the state reach millions of dollars — and those are just from complaints union workers hear. Many won’t notice or say anything.

Paul Doremus general manager of Smithfield in Crete said his facility has established a working relationship with the union.

“If we make a mistake I want to make sure we correct it” he said.

Jim Monroe Smithfield’s vice president of corporate affairs said the necessity of meat processing plants is often overlooked. Not only do they provide food to consumers all over the world but they play a vital role in the economies of major farming and ranching states like Nebraska.

The Department of Homeland Security deemed meat processors essential workers during the pandemic.

“It’s one of the reasons we have so much gratitude for our team members” Monroe said.

'They yell at you like you’re an animal'

Each of the six workers from the state's meatpacking industry the Journal Star spoke with mentioned being afraid of or intimidated by their supervisors.

Sara said her supervisors tend to yell but the way her bosses treat workers sometimes depends on the employee’s ethnicity.

“My supervisor does have a lot of favoritism towards certain employees” she said. “I know that certain supervisors get along better with people from (the U.S.) and not as much with the Hispanics.”

Carmen* said she reported a supervisor to HR but she was told it was his word against hers.

“I’m scared to have these types of supervisors … because of the way they’re acting” she said.

Carmen said some supervisors grope female employees. The workers who relent get certain benefits like days off. In a separate interview Sara said workers who have sexual relations with supervisors are favored.

Tromanhauser said she frequently hears allegations of sexual abuse in plants. Independently Reeder also said he has heard complaints of women being sexually harassed.

Andy said his supervisors yell every day.

In fits of rage supervisors have threatened Andy’s job and called him a “stupid Mexican.” They intimidate employees to complete tasks even if they’re unable.

“They yell at you like you’re an animal” he said. “They think they are smart and we are stupid because we use a knife.”

When workers at his plant try to complain about their bosses’ behavior they’re asked to leave.

“It's sad to see what's going on” he said. “If you try to go to HR and say ‘This supervisor intimidated and yelled at me’ they’ll say ‘Oh you know what? You don't want to work so you get out of here.’”

Vega Brown said she felt some of her supervisors were racist.

“They’d say ‘You wanted to work — work. You wanted to go north. This is the north. Work!’”

When the Occupational Safety and Health Administration comes for regular inspections — announced or not — Tim said conditions improve.

Supervisors are nicer and the line slows to a much more reasonable pace.

“Sometimes the supervisors know when OSHA is coming … So they try to make sure everything's looking good” he said. “Or if they can't do it in time they'll just send everybody to break so that there's no workers while OSHA’s walking around inspecting the plant.”

Lombardo with Smithfield believes the company differs from its competitors because of its culture. She said Smithfield goes out of its way to make sure employees feel valued and cared for no matter their role.

“Our people really are everything to us” she said. “They’re not a cost to us. They’re a value to us.”

'We take seriously our role as an employer'

In Nebraska the largest meatpacking companies are JBS Cargill Tyson and Smithfield.

In Smithfield’s Crete plant roughly 70% of the nearly 1500 employees are “white hat” processors or non-lead hands-on meatpackers. These workers have the same jobs as the six meatpackers the Journal Star spoke with at their respective plants.

A supervisor line lead production scheduler and quality control monitor at the Crete plant were at a roundtable employee discussion and while no white hats were present all attendees said they were heavily involved in line production.

Each employee at the discussion said they’d had a positive experience with the company. They had all been there for several years. Some decades. Praises ranged from the familial atmosphere to the generous pay — meat processors at Smithfield start at $21.50 an hour.

Production supervisor Tyler Johnson said the company is extremely safety conscious and it encourages workers to be in close communication with their bosses about potential concerns.

“I try to do my part to talk to every single person on my line just to ensure that if something’s wrong or off that they get the help that they need” he said. “I stay in pretty good communication with my people.”

Lombardo said Smithfield instituted a “hands up” policy to ensure workers feel empowered to report potential issues or injuries. Raising a hand while on the line is meant to immediately alert supervisors to attend to a problem.

Additionally she believes workers are well taken care of in every physical and emotional aspect.

On the tour Smithfield representatives showed the Journal Star its various processing lines — nearly every station except the kill floor. Employees were told ahead of time that the Journal Star would be present but general manager Doremus said the tour was a proper display of the plant’s daily activity.

Tyson Foods — which has plants in Omaha Madison Dakota City and Lexington — provided a written statement that said the company is committed to giving its workers the best environment possible.

“We take very seriously our role as an employer to a large and very diverse workforce and are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace for all of our team members” the statement read.

Tyson said it provides many avenues for workers to complain about mistreatment such as Human Resources its Employment Compliance Department or the anonymous Tell Tyson First hotline.

Reeder said some of the companies have been responsive to complaints made through the union. But certain plants are more receptive than others he said.

And while Reeder works to hold the companies accountable for their practices it can be difficult for the higher-ups to get a full picture of what’s happening on the line all the time.

“The companies that have the most trouble are the larger factories” Reeder said. “You've got a small HR team that is trying to manage the plant.”

In response to questions Cargill provided a written statement. The company boasted of safety programs like LIFESavers and Human and Organization Performance training that contribute to the security of workers.

“Our protein plants are operating in compliance with federal safety guidelines and we work closely with state and local health authorities as well as union representation to make sure each plant meets the highest safety standards …” it read in part.

The company further maintained that its code of conduct prohibits any worker mistreatment and potential misconduct is handled “promptly fairly and as confidentially as possible.”

JBS too provided a written response to the Journal Star’s list of questions. The company statement said its Ethics and Compliance department investigates all allegations and takes the necessary steps to remedy issues.

“We have zero tolerance for abuse discrimination intimidation or mistreatment of our team members and action should be taken immediately if any of these things takes place in our facilities” the statement read.

'Please can you help us?'

Some meatpacking workers have hope that things could improve but others aren’t so sure.

“Unless somebody from the outside is willing to help I don’t see it getting better” Victor said.

Andy said he’s not sure if things will improve either. Throughout the many years he’s been a meat processor things have stayed more or less the same.

But he still hopes legislators will pay attention to the industry's issues.

“Please can you help us? Can you make some laws to protect us?” he said.

Andy said he felt it was most important for the line speeds to be slowed down. He finds it sometimes impossible to work at the pace his employer requires.

In 1999 former Gov. Mike Johanns created a meatpacking workers’ bill of rights after reading stories published in the Journal Star detailing the plight of employees but Tromanhauser doesn’t believe much has changed since then.

For now Carmen Victor Andy Sara and Tim continue to work in what they describe as poor conditions. Vega Brown has moved on from her former employer but she still struggles with chronic pain as a result of the physical stress she once put on her body.

By speaking out Andy said he hopes his fellow Nebraskans will begin to understand the challenges he experiences all to put food on their tables.

“How can we sacrifice people to make all this food?”

Carmen and Victor were interviewed with the help of family members who assisted with translation. Sara utilized the translation skills of Ruby Mendez Lopez a bilingual employee with Nebraska Appleseed. Journal Star reporter Evelyn Mejia assisted with the translation of Vega Brown’s interview.

Is Bank of America's new zero-down mortgage worth it?

Home buying is a notoriously expensive process and has gotten even more costly as property values have increased over the years. When you consider a modest 5% down payment lender fees which can run you up to 1% of the home's value and closing costs which can be as high as 6% of the loan's value buyers can pay close to $46800 upfront for a $400000 home — this still excludes other charges like the underwriting fee title check home inspection and appraisal fees. Offering a loan that doesn't require a down payment mortgage insurance or closing costs could lower the barrier to entry for homeownership. And when you spend less money on down payment and closing costs you can reserve more of your savings for paying for serious home repairs that need to be taken care of or emergency expenses that could arise as soon as you move in. Just keep in mind though that making no down payment means that your home loan will cover the entire value of the property and your monthly payments can be higher than they'd be if you paid a little upfront. You'll need to work with a financial planner or mortgage lender to make sure that the monthly payments will fit into your budget.

Who will be eligible?

While the goal of the program is to bring Black and Hispanic borrowers closer to homeownership people of all races can qualify for the Community Affordable Loan Solution. Eligibility will be based on income and the location of the property. It will also use credit guidelines based on factors such as timely rent utility bill phone and auto insurance payments to determine creditworthiness though there is no minimum credit score requirement. If you're interested in applying for a loan through this program you must also complete a homebuyer certification course provided by select Bank of America and HUD-approved housing counseling partners before submitting your loan application. ""Our community affordable loan solution will help make the dream of sustained homeownership attainable for more Black and Hispanic families and it is part of our broader commitment to the communities that we serve"" AJ Barkley head of neighborhood and community lending at Bank of America said in a statement.

The new program is geared toward first-time homebuyers including in designated neighborhoods in Charlotte Dallas Detroit Los Angeles and Miami. Bank of America said the program will not take a borrower's credit score into account when applying for a home loan.

Black and Hispanic families typically don't have a large stash of cash on hand to fund a home down payment and closing costs so Bank of America removing those barriers will certainly help someone on the hunt for home Indiana University finance professor Jun Zhu told CBS News.

""If you have a program with no down payment and no closing costs it can help minority families to fill the gap between available savings and upfront cash needed"" said Zhu an expert on mortgage financing and housing affordability.

To qualify for the Bank of America program applicants must seek to buy a home in one of the five cities and complete a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development-certified homebuyer course. Applicants won't need mortgage insurance after they've acquired the loan.

Rates of homeownership vary dramatically across racial and ethnic groups thanks to differences in wealth and the legacy of historic discrimination. About 7 in 10 White households own homes while only 4 in 10 Black households and 5 in 10 Hispanic households do according to the National Association of Realtors.

Like many other touring packages it’s been side-tracked for over two years. The pent-up excitement and anticipation add it to the craziness of this tour. I was fortunate enough to see three shows. Minneapolis at the US bank stadium San Antonio TX at the Alamodome and Arlington TX at the stadium where the Texas Rangers play. This review is a combination of those three shows and all the different things that I experienced while I was there.

Let’s start out with the opener Classless Act. they are a new band from Los Angeles who I have to say are incredible. I was lucky enough to see them the first time opening for Dorothy earlier this year and promised myself that I would always go see them whenever they came to town. They’ve got great upbeat songs and more energy than any band I’ve seen in recent history other than Fever 333. I think they have a very bright future ahead of them and if you’re not familiar with them because you showed up too late take a few moments and look them up on YouTube. They are straightforward rock’n’roll and love to entertain their audience. I highly recommend you check them out.

Joan Jett and the Blackhearts followed with an incredible set. I’ve been a fan of hers since the late 1970s and have seen her more times than I can count. I was excited that she was going to be on this tour but I felt that she was somewhat ignored when you look at all of the hype that surrounded this tour. It’s easy to understand because I wouldn’t consider Joan Jett in the category of the rest of these bands. Although she’s every bit as talented if not more.

The great thing for me as a fan was to see her play in front of almost a full stadium. People really showed up to support her and sang along with almost every single song. You can’t be an 80s rock fan and not know most of her hits. She has a new album out now that’s an acoustic performance of some of her favorite songs. She did one song acoustically in each one of these shows which is run away that’s my favorite a song from the performance and one of my favorite songs of hers. Mostly because it’s not a hit and it’s just a great song that appears on her second album I love rock’n’roll. Joan Jett is another artist that if you’ve never seen her you owe it to yourself to get out and see her play live. She still sounds fantastic and she has always an amazing band.

The next band to play was Poison. When you talk to people who attended this tour it seems like there’s overwhelming amount of them that would say that Poison stole the show. I would have to agree with this statement if I had only seen one show. They work their way through a solid set of hits and everybody in the stadium was on their feet. I think what’s surprised people most is how energetic they are and how much they truly were happy to be there. I think as a fan when you spend a lot of money you like to feel that the performers that are entertaining you are glad that you’re there. There was no denying that Poison was happy you were there.

They’ve taken a lot of crap over the years from rock fans who think they are soft in comparison to say Slayer. Perhaps that’s true to a certain extent when you listen to the sound of the band. Say what you want but these guys know how to write songs and they know how to entertain an audience. I was able to actually spend some time with several of them over dinner. All of them are truly the nicest clothes you would ever want to meet. Why would I tell you this and why does it matter? To me it matters a lot because I want to root for people who are nice. I’m invested in the success of other people who are kind that want to do the best they can do. I think this tour was perfect for them in the respect that it will revitalize the interest in them and allow them to do a tour of larger places and be the headliner. Their songs are catchy and woven into the 1980s music scene. It’s not an easy thing to do when you have so many bands and artists that fall by the wayside after one song. If you’re looking for nothing but a good time you’ll be able to find it at a Poison concert.

Co-headliner Def Leppard Has been described as a machine. A band that is perfect every time you see them. I’m not suggesting for a moment that a statement like that is not completely true. But if you think about it it’s a little bit of a backhanded compliment. Almost like oh they just show up get on stage and they’re perfect. There’s so much more work that goes into it than that. All of the vocals that you’re hearing and it Def Leppard show is 100% completely live. They spend a lot of time before each show warming up and singing with one another before they hit the stage. The reason they are so good is because they’re so committed to what they do. I think it’s worth pointing that out so it doesn’t get lost in all the other things that are said about the band.

They are truly like the fine line of rock and roll. They just keep getting better every single year. The new album that just came out is solid and reminds me so much of many of their past releases. They don’t compromise and they always give it their all. It’s always a pleasure to watch them perform because they are so good. There another one of those bands that have hits you heard a million times that you may not listen too much anymore in your car. But when they’re being played live they take on a life of their own again. The highlight for me in their set is ”Switch 625”. It’s an instrumental off their early release High N’ Dry. It took me back to being a teenager again. There’s just something about it. If you like rock’n’roll never give up an opportunity to go and see Def Leppard live. There’s no way you can’t know all the songs.

Rounding out the evening as a co-headliner Motley Crue. For any of you that may not know this every other night they would switch with Def Leppard to close the show. Motley Crue has always been one of my favorite bands. I don’t have an issue with them retiring and now coming back again. There’s certainly not the first band nor will they be the last to pull a stunt like this. In fact I think whoever runs our social media is quite funny. Some fans were complaining that they paid a lot of money to see the very last show five years ago. The answer to those fans was if you never come see us again it was your last show. I know that may sound abrasive to some but I found it to be funny.

The first night I saw them in Minneapolis they were the weak link on this tour. It pains me to say that and there will be a lot of people who will continue to argue that point because they can’t seem to stomach Vince Neil. Many people will ask me how did he sound? My answer is he’s improved a lot over the last few years but he’s still Vince Neil. In the same way David Lee Roth is still David Lee Roth. If you look back at some of the most classic Van Halen tours that were among my favorites. If you listen to them on a tape after you would think to yourself wow that’s how it sounded? A friend of mine Brian that I mentioned on the Eddie Trunk radio show last week had a very interesting take on all of this. He said he doesn’t really expect Vince Neil to sing like the records in the same way he didn’t think that way about David Lee Roth. He goes for the entire experience of the show and doesn’t sit and nitpick things like people so love to do on YouTube nowadays. There was something more going on though that night. You could argue that point all you want and say that he’s wrong or agree with him. But at the end of the day all that matters is did you go to the show and enjoy it? Many people walked out of there very happy. Does that make them wrong? I don’t believe so. In fact I will also say that the last person who should ever have an opinion on any live show is the person who’s watching it on YouTube and didn’t attend. Those are the people I wish would just shut their mouth.

I thought let’s be open minded about this and see how they sound when I make it down to Texas a few weeks later. I can tell you they were good when we were down in Texas. The biggest problem was the sound. And that was the big complaint from a lot of people. They couldn’t hear the songs because they were playing so loud. By the time they got to Texas it seemed like they had brought Mick Mars guitars up higher in the mix and didn’t frontload the bass so much. I think that’s another reason why all the other bands sounded considerably better. They didn’t play at an earsplitting volume which makes all the difference in the world when you’re attending a show like that. Especially in these huge football stadiums where the sound just bounces around and gets lost.

Motley Crue performed the set that I would expect them to. But they did add “Too Fast For Love” and a medley that included “Helter Skelter” “White Punks On Dope” and “Anarchy in the UK”. That was probably my favorite part of their set. I am personally happy that they are back. Expect to see a lot more of them in the coming years. Rumor has it that this tour will be headed overseas next year because of the success here in the United States. I’m not sure if the lineup will be the same but it will be interesting to see what happens.

I like to attend concerts of all different types of music and in all different types of locations. But I would say that this situation is my least favorite only because the venues are so over the top huge that you lose some of the intimacy. Plus larger crowds equal more trouble. Watching the Mötley Crüe set versus the Def Leppard set was an interesting thing. Even though it was the same crowd for both bands when Def Leppard was on everyone was just paying attention to the music and for the most part not moving around a lot. When Mötley Crüe played it was absolute complete and total chaos. It’s one of the oddest things I’ve ever seen at a concert there’s something about Mötley Crüe that gets everybody really worked up. Perhaps that’s the magic of that band. That’s not taking away anything from any of the other bands. All of them were met with enthusiasm and a lot of cheering. It’s just with Mötley Crüe it kind of turned into caveman day. Would I go see it again? Of course I would I’m a sucker for 80s rock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vc2xhdGUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjIvMDkvYm95ZnJpZW5kLWJhbmstYWNjb3VudC1wZXJzb25hbC1maW5hbmNlLWFkdmljZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,My boyfriend does not have a bank account and it's making dating difficult,"Pay Dirt is Slate’s money advice column. Have a question? Send it to Athena and Elizabeth here. (It’s anonymous!)

Dear Pay Dirt

My boyfriend and I are in very different economic situations—I have an office job making just under six figures and he gets paid weekly in physical cash. I don’t have any fundamental issues with this and I don’t believe that working for a small business has any less inherent worth than my data crunching job but some of the effects of the details are becoming an issue.

Because he doesn’t have a credit card any time we decide to order delivery or buy tickets to an event it has to be on me since I’m the only one who can place the online order. (I’ll usually get paid back eventually but it’s still a charge on my statement) He also has put off buying several important necessary things that he has the money to spend on because he lacks the funds available digitally to purchase things online. While I’m tempted to say the solution is to help him open up a credit card or at least a debit card at a local bank where he can physically deposit his pay he has ADHD that sometimes leads to impulsive decisions and I know that easily available money that isn’t “real” could be a dangerous combo with that. How do I get out of being the designated “person with a credit card” while also helping them build good habits without overstepping?

—Cash or Card?

Dear Cash or Card

Life is very difficult to navigate without a bank account especially a debit card so I’m fairly impressed he’s been able to do this. As someone with ADHD I can also see why having access to a debit card might influence his spending since the money doesn’t seem “real.” However this is a money management issue that affects many people not just those with ADHD. It’s not up to you to help him open a credit card but you can direct him to a site like Experian— where he can find guides on how to access credit responsibly—when you bring this up to him. (I have worked with Experian in the past.) That’s the next step. You need to have a conversation with him one-on-one.

As you get more comfortable in a relationship you start to realize what is no longer working. Explain that as you continue to get serious you would like to start taking turns purchasing items that require a card so neither one of you has multiple purchases to keep track of. You can direct him to websites that offer solutions and tips for money management as a person with ADHD. Money is one of the key reasons listed for divorce so it’s better to encourage him to get his finances in order now. He can still utilize a cash budget but having access to a checking account will be more beneficial than he realizes in the long run.

I am just finishing a science PhD program and will start a new position as a postdoctoral researcher on the other side of the country in a couple of months. My income will be nearly doubling but so will at least some of my expenses; I’ll be getting a car for the first time and I expect I’ll be paying much more than my current rent.

I am incredibly privileged to have no student loans or other debt and between general frugality and not feeling like I have the time to go out and do very much outside of the lab I have been living well below my means as a graduate student. I have been putting the maximum amount in a Roth IRA for the last five years and sending a smaller amount monthly to a separate investment account with pretty boring investments (ETFs). I check my bank account once or twice a month and a few times a year I’ll track my income and expenses to make sure I have more money coming in than going out but I haven’t needed to strictly budget.

The new job and the move have me re-evaluating what want to spend money on and there are so many decisions to make! I want to keep living below my means but I also want to build a bit more of a social life. But even going for a hike costs something (gas park permits etc.). Do I just keep going with my IRA or should I start contributing to the employer-matched retirement plan when I become eligible? Should I be doing something different with my investments? Can I keep going with my current expense-tracking method or should I start monitoring my spending more closely? I worry a lot more than I probably should about money given that it has never really been an issue for me but the U.S. has such a poor social safety net and there are so many possible future expenses that it seems like the only safe thing to do is to save as much as possible.

Even when we’re doing well we sometimes think we’re doing poorly. It’s just our conditioning and it happens a lot with our relationship with money. You’re actually doing great so take a moment to sit with that and give yourself the credit you deserve.

If your employer offers a 401(k) option take advantage of it. Many employers offer a match and even if they don’t this is still another good avenue for retirement saving along with your IRA. Take advantage of as much as you can when it comes to compound interest. Still continue to invest in your EFTs and just check the market from time to time to make sure you’re on track with any investing goals you’ve set for yourself.

Your current system for tracking your cash seems to be going well so I’d continue on but consider giving yourself room in your budget for fun. Even if it’s $100 a month spend money treating yourself. Give yourself the money to go for hikes try new restaurants and check out your new city. Life is short so let yourself live a little. You’ll be grateful that you did.

Dear Pay Dirt

My husband and I are in our early 40s and have a 1-year-old child. I have a pretty stable career and income and he does too. We are solidly middle class. The issue is that he wants to quit his job as a social worker and become a therapist in private practice (he is a licensed social worker already so this wouldn’t require any additional education).

Advertisement

Advertisement

At first I was incredibly resistant to the idea. In my view you just don’t give up a steady paycheck no matter how unhappy the work makes you. But he’s so unhappy stressed out and just emotionally exhausted from working with the population he works with. I’ve done the research and I believe that he can be successful in private practice. Everyone we’ve spoken to says that therapists are in big demand so we don’t think he’ll have problems getting clients. Not only that but he has the potential to make much more money! We have some money coming in. More than enough to keep us afloat for a year while he gets his practice off the ground.

Advertisement

But his parents are decidedly NOT on board. They argue that we should use the money as a down payment for a house and he should try this in four or five years when our child is older. Honestly they are acting as if we said we wanted to put all our money into cryptocurrency or essential oils. I think now is the best time: We are very stable (if a little squished) in our two-bedroom city condo. We have the condo mortgage and one car and car note; I carry everyone on my work insurance so we’re not going to lose any health coverage. If we bought a house in the suburbs we would have to buy another car (two car notes) plus we’d have a higher mortgage and other expenses related to house upkeep.

Our situation is such that if we lived like monks and stopped saving we could even conceivably survive on just my income while he started his practice. We have zero chance of being able to afford this change later with the higher expenses of a house and two cars and kids don’t get less expensive as they get older. If he doesn’t try it now he’s pretty much never going to be able to. We think we can be on pace to continue saving for a house in a year or so and will be able to buy one before our child starts kindergarten which was always at the long end of our timeline. Our financial planner is on board with this plan and can help us get things even better situated to make this leap. Are my husband and I wrong? Is this a horrible idea?

Bless your in-laws and their over-controlling hearts. They are trying hard to ensure that there is no financial ruin yet they do not understand self-employment and how it works. If you both were struggling and living paycheck to paycheck with no savings or a plan I would say hell no don’t do that. But you’re not. You have adequate savings have health insurance mapped out and you’ve agreed to keep living below your means. You are right when you say now is the time to try this change because it’s not going to get easier.

Every state has different requirements and licensing when it comes to practicing as an individual such as needing malpractice insurance so make sure he’s ready to go on that front. Also look to see if he needs to register as an LLC to keep your assets away from his business in case something happens. Check in with your financial planner and follow their recommendations. And last but not least kindly thank your in-laws for their advice but express it’s already been handled. If they continue to pry your husband can use some of his social work superpowers to set and enforce healthy boundaries.

Dear Pay Dirt

My husband and I are planning a move next year at the end of a contract and we’re having trouble comparing offers in different cities. He is the primary breadwinner and is interviewing for jobs in multiple cities all of which have a higher cost of living than our current city. I work remotely for a good salary and I will keep my job when we move (my boss is on board). What we’re struggling with is how to weigh different salaries/benefits from different offers when the costs of living are different between the cities. A mortgage is easy to gauge using Zillow but I assume spending on daily things will also go up. Is there a way to estimate this? He currently has two job offers that look drastically different on paper but the higher one is in a much more expensive area and we’re struggling to figure out how to compare. We save plenty and live within our means but we don’t track our daily spending so that’s not helping. Do you have any suggestions?

I agree that Zillow isn’t always the best way to price a new city. There are other factors beyond housing to consider when moving to a new place such as groceries utilities public transportation etc. Check out this cost of living calculator by Nerd Wallet. You can type in what city you currently reside in and how much you make and select a city you’d like to compare. Nerd Wallet will then shoot out the comparable income along with an explanation for costs such as food school and health care. It’s a really cool tool that will help you price out his offers without jumping into the unknown.

If this tool isn’t what you’re looking for you can always go the paper and pencil route. Look back at your spending for a month and roughly calculate how much you spent on aspects like transportation and do some research on how that might compare in a new city. You can also do things like open an Instacart account and then price shopping trips in your current city and the potential one. This way you can see (very roughly remember Instacart sometimes upcharges) how much the same items cost to also get an idea.

I’m excited for you and your new journey!

My husband and I have been married for 15 years and we have two elementary-age kids. A few months ago I discovered by accident that my spouse had long been out of work and had hidden this from me (including lying when I asked specific questions). He had secretly opened multiple credit cards (bills only came to his email) and incurred over $100000 in debt. It’s unclear where the money went."

These are the best ways to get there,"If you’ve ever been to a Patriots game you know getting in and out of Gillette Stadium is … well … a hassle to say the least.

Whether it’s by train rideshare car taxi or bus … we have you covered on the best ways to get there on game day.

BY MBTA:

Between traffic gas prices and parking costs — driving to Gillette on game day can be expensive and unpredictable. Especially if you’re coming from the city.

So what’s the best option? The train is by far the fastest cheapest and most predictable way to get to Foxboro on game day.

The MBTA offers service from Boston and Providence to Gillette Stadium which is locally known as the Patriot Train. Round trip pricing is about $20 but fares are always subject to change so please verify on the MBTA website.

The Boston train stops at South Station Back Bay Station and Dedham Corporate Station. And if you’re coming from the south you can also grab the Gillette-bound Patriot Train at the TF Green Airport which has additional stops in Providence South Attleboro and Mansfield.

Patriots Train tickets from Boston are available a week before each game* so it’s highly recommended to buy in advance since tickets typically sell out before game day. *Dedham Corporate Station sells tickets on game days.

You can buy round-trip tickets on the MBTA App for iOS and Android. If you don’t have the app downloaded already head to the App Store search “MBTA mTicket” and download to buy tickets at your selected station.

If you don’t want to download the app simply visit your location station and purchase tickets through the Commuter Rail window. Just remember: regular commuter rail tickets/passes aren’t valid for the Patriot Train.

You can find the train schedule on MBTA’s website.

BY UBER/LYFT:

If you’re using a rideshare app on game day call your Uber or Lyft to the designated parking lot (Lot 15) near the Bass Pro Shops. Due to high volume and demand on game day it’s best to schedule your ride to and from Gillette.

BY CAR:

If you’re driving to Foxboro on game day steer clear from using your GPS. Why? Road closures and traffic restrictions near the stadium will make navigation complicated. If you’re coming from the north use I-95. If you’re coming from elsewhere use I-495.

BY TAXI:

If you decide to drive to Gillette on game day — and park far away from the stadium — you can take a taxi to your parking spot after the game. The pick-up is located in Lot 23.

BY BUS*:

Traveling to Gillette with a large group*? Boston Common Coach is great option if you’re traveling with a big party but don’t want to take different cars sit in traffic and pay for multiple parking spots.

This is a safe and affordable option ($65 per adult and $35 per child ages 5-12) offering road trip service from both downtown Boston (291 Tremont St.) four hours prior to the game and the North Shore Mall in Peabody (outside the Cheesecake Factory) nearly five hours ahead of kickoff. Buses depart from Gillette one hour prior to the end of the game.

Now I know what you’re thinking … if you’re with a big group you likely want to tailgate. Boston Common Coach has you covered. They have coolers with ice restrooms and TVs on board. Your ticket also gets you free snacks refreshments and water. And since the buses stay on site think of it as your home base.

Check Boston Common Coach’s website for schedules fares and reservation information.

*You can also book single tickets if you’re traveling alone or per person with a smaller group",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc2VyZXQuY29tL3V0YWgvMjAyMi85LzQvMjMzMDA3NDEvdGF4aS1jb21lYmFjay1pbi1zYWx0LWxha2UtY2l0eS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Taxis in Salt Lake City: Yellow Cab Ute Cab making comeback – Deseret News,"Almoh Bahaji owner of Yellow Cab in Salt Lake City poses for photos with his general manager Jay Wacker at the offices on Wednesday Aug. 10 2022.

Almoh Bahaji and Jay Wacker a couple of friendly blue jeans-wearing 60-year-olds don’t look like counterrevolutionaries. Nor do their no-frills offices in the yellow cinderblock building on the west side of town look like the kind of high ground from which to launch an offensive.

But make no mistake these men are fighting back hard bound and determined to return the once and mighty king to its former glory.

Namely the taxicab.

Everyone knows cabs haven’t had an easy go of it the past decade. First came Uber then Lyft ride-sharing companies you could summon from your phone!

Not only did the new technology quickly and efficiently bring rides to you no matter where you were but the drivers got online consumer ratings a sort of built-in quality control — in sharp contrast to cabs where customer service often amounted to you’re-lucky-we-picked-you-up.

Gone was the virtual monopoly cabs had enjoyed since the invention of the Model T. Demand plunged practically overnight.

Yellow Cab of Salt Lake City is a case in point. Riding high with a fleet of 150 cabs circa 2012 by 2016 it was down to 40.

The owners and shareholders put the business up for sale which was no surprise. What was a surprise was that someone bought it.

People were pretty sure Almoh Bahaji had either lost his mind or was about to.

But Almoh had two very good reasons for buying what looked like a dinosaur: One he had been driving for the company since 1999; two and more importantly during that time he’d bought dozens of cabs that he contracted out to other drivers.

If Yellow Cab ceased to exist he’d be left with a garage full of yellow colored cars and nowhere to drive them.

Fortunately facing long odds did not scare a man who first had to escape a civil war in his homeland of Somalia before arriving in Salt Lake City in 1996 as a refugee with $80 to his name.

He was living in The Road Home homeless shelter when he drove his first cab.

After that he says “I began living the American dream.”

He first socked enough away to purchase his own car. Then he socked enough away to buy more cars and hire them out. His fleet was front and center for the 2002 Olympics when Salt Lake taxis had their greatest month ever.

The taxicab business — For Yellow Cab and for Almoh — stayed steady through 2009 when Uber was born and through 2012 when Lyft came to be. Then came the slippery slope followed by the fire sale.

First thing Almoh did when the company was his was admit to himself what he didn’t know.

He could see that the previous management “didn’t plan very well for Uber and Lyft; they didn’t form any strategy” but he didn’t know how to modernize the business.

“That’s why I got Jay” he says.

Jay is Jay Wacker a man who in one way or another has been in the transportation business all of his life as a driver a dispatcher a customer service director a manager. With his experience and track record preceding him Almoh asked Jay to be his operations supervisor.

“I’ll give you six months” he said.

That was five years ago.

The fact they’re still standing is testament to where hard work and determination will get you.

That and a new business model.

Instead of being repelled by technology they embraced it. They got a rider app called CURB that does the same thing as the Uber and Lyft apps. They aggressively went after contracts with hotels and other businesses including the airport promising better service with their new software. They chiseled away at the longstanding negative taxi culture of customers serving the driver rather than the other way around.

“Taxis were the only one doing it for a long time and they were fairly apathetic to customer service and to some extent they still are” says Jay. “But we’re trying to get an understanding of what a taxi service is supposed to look like instead of the old legacy. We’re a service industry. That’s all we have is service.”

Like everything else the new business model didn’t plan for the pandemic but somehow it managed to survive 2020 if barely. At the lowest point during the lockdown they were down to just 10 drivers.

They have rebounded ever since to the point they now have 84 cabs in their fleet (they’ve also acquired Ute Cab) they’re getting 800 app hits a day (not including corporate accounts and the airport) — and they’re constantly looking to add more cabs and more drivers.

A good sign that they’re doing something right: of their last dozen driver hires 10 have come from Uber and Lyft.

“We can compete with Uber and Lyft” says Jay noting that one big advantage cabs have is that unlike their ride-sharing competitors they charge the same fare for the same route no matter the time of day and regardless of supply and demand. There are no surge charges.

“People don’t like surge charges” he says.

“I like our position I like where we are” says the counterrevolutionary a noticeable touch of pride in his voice. “We took over a dying business and revitalized it. Our future looks bright. We’re a long way from being done.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3RlY2guaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL3RlY2gvbmV3cy91YmVyLWFuZC1seWZ0LWRyaXZlcnMtaW4tbmV3LXlvcmstc3RydWdnbGUtd2l0aC1jaXR5LXMtZXYtY2hhcmdpbmctZGl2aWRlLTcxNjYyMTE0MzcyNTI5Lmh0bWzSAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoLmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvdGVjaC9uZXdzL3ViZXItYW5kLWx5ZnQtZHJpdmVycy1pbi1uZXcteW9yay1zdHJ1Z2dsZS13aXRoLWNpdHktcy1ldi1jaGFyZ2luZy1kaXZpZGUtNzE2NjIxMTQzNzI1MjkuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber and Lyft Drivers in New York Struggle With City’s Electric Vehicle-Charging Divide,"Manhattan's abundance of electric-car chargers is a boon for the burgeoning number of Tesla drivers in New York's wealthiest borough. But for the vast majority of ride-share drivers who live elsewhere in the Big Apple that network is largely out of reach.

This EV-charging divide poses a challenge for ride-hailing leaders Uber and Lyft which need more drivers behind the wheels of electric vehicles to meet their lofty emissions-reduction goals.

Bronx-based Mohammed Islam 44 typically spends about 30 minutes and roughly $40 to charge his Tesla Model Y SUV inside the parking garage of the Bay Plaza Shopping Center before starting a shift for Uber. It's a short drive from his home and one of the only public fast chargers in the borough that can power an electric car battery to 80% in half an hour. If it's too crowded or the chargers don't work the closest option is a lower-voltage facility a mile away where an equivalent charge would take almost eight hours.

Manhattan is New York's richest borough and has by far the most chargers according to the Department of Transportation. However most Uber and Lyft drivers live in the outer boroughs. At 40% Queens has the highest concentration of ride-share drivers in the city according to the Taxi and Limousine Commission yet has only 16% of the city's over 1900 public chargers.

The range anxiety that can plague any EV owner is especially acute for these ride-share drivers in New York where most count on driving as a full-time job. For them the unequal distribution of chargers directly affects their take-home pay. It's also a problem for their platforms. Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. both pledged to electrify fleets in North America by 2030 and have ramped up incentives and perks to entice drivers to trade in gas guzzlers for an EV. Their goals are colliding with a charging system that was made to serve wealthy customers and not working-class members of the gig economy.

It's an uphill climb for the San Francisco-based apps. Only 1% of the 71500 ride-share vehicles in New York are electric according to the TLC. That's slightly better than at the national level according to clean-energy research firm BloombergNEF. Uber is doing better in Europe where government incentives have helped spur the switch to EVs.

Uber has 26000 EVs active on the platform and plans to spend $800 million in incentives charging discounts and other benefits to help drivers make the switch to an electric vehicle. In London it's taking steps to get more EVs on the streets by partnering with fintech Moove which uses an alternative underwriting model to make it easier for gig workers to get a vehicle.

Uber also recently created a new role — head of charging infrastructure — dedicated to working with car manufacturers charging companies and others to expand access for drivers.

“For Uber to be successful in the EV transition we need to make investment go into places where drivers are concentrated” said Chris Hook who leads global sustainability strategy at Uber. “It needs to be equitable.”

Queens-based Viraj Desai 25 said he isn't willing to trade the certainty his Toyota Camry provides for his Uber shifts even if it comes with a high gas bill.

'I would never switch to an EV. I've seen too many people wasting their time charging' he said. 'I need to know I can work. I can't afford to be offline.'

For their part cities should prioritize building public chargers in lower income neighborhoods Hook said. Uber is working with lawmakers in key cities including London and Paris by sharing data on driving patterns like trip durations pickups and destinations. It's also helping drum up interest from car-charging companies that are skeptical of the commercial benefits of rollouts in lower income areas where on the whole EV adoption is still nascent.

Lyft said its EV rental program and partnerships with charging providers like EVgo and Electrify America have helped boost the number of EVs on its platform by 22% compared with last year. Still “there's a very big role for the public side to fill in order to address charging equity and ride-share can be a powerful partner” Paul Augustine Lyft's director of sustainability said in an interview. In May the company wrote to New York Governor Kathy Hochul to stress the importance of increasing funding to charging access for low-income and disadvantaged communities.

“The buck stops with all of us” Augustine said. “We need to set the right market conditions where it's a no-brainer for drivers to make the switch.”

New York's lawmakers have goals of their own: the Department of Transportation plans to install 10000 curbside chargers across all five boroughs and equip 40% of parking spots in municipal lots with fast chargers by 2030. Spokesman Vin Barone said more than 85% of curbside chargers installed by the city are in the outer boroughs.

“Equity is a guiding principle as this administration works to expand access to electric vehicle charging” he said. “DOT will continue to work closely with the TLC on policy and infrastructure to support the transition to EVs among for-hire vehicle drivers and all drivers in the city.”

Uber has pledged to be zero-emissions globally by 2040 and Lyft which only operates in North America has targeted 2030. New York is one of their largest markets so progress on electrification there is critical to reaching their climate goals.

Even under ambitious policy scenarios the city still has a long way to go according to Matthew Moniot a researcher at the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Moniot led a May study on New York's charging network and ride-hailing services that showed even if EVs made up only 30% of its ride-hailing fleet the city would need to increase the current count of 68 fast-charging ports to over 1000 to meet demand.

Expanding public charging alone won't solve EV's inequality problem Moniot said. “It won't be fully equitable until ride-share drivers are able to charge at home” he said. New York's ride-share EVs have to charge three times more frequently than personal cars because they build up mileage more quickly.

“The trick is finding ways to charge off-shift so they can dedicate time to making money” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5c3Rhci5uZXQvdGVjaC1zdGFydHVwL25ld3MvdWJlci1jb250cmlidXRlZC10ay00NS1iaWxsaW9uLWJkLWVjb25vbXktMjAyMS1yZXBvcnQtMzExMDY3MdIBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5c3Rhci5uZXQvdGVjaC1zdGFydHVwL25ld3MvdWJlci1jb250cmlidXRlZC10ay00NS1iaWxsaW9uLWJkLWVjb25vbXktMjAyMS1yZXBvcnQtMzExMDY3MT9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber contributed Tk 45 Billion to BD economy in 2021: report,"Uber's 2021 Bangladesh Economic Impact Report researched and compiled by Public First a UK-based policy research firm was unveiled today at an event in the national capital. The Report highlights how Uber has helped transform the on-demand economy for riders driver partners and the wider community by generating Tk. 45 Billion for the Bangladesh economy in 2021.

It deep dives into the factors behind the economic contribution consumer surplus how users benefit and how driver partners gain from flexible work. Key findings of the Report include:

Uber contributed an estimated Tk. 45 Billion to the Bangladesh economy in 2021. This includes both the impact of earnings of driver-partners facilitated by Uber and the wider indirect and induced multiplier effect created throughout the company's wider supply chain.

Rides on Uber's platform produced Tk. 70 Billion in consumer surplus in 2021 which is roughly equivalent to 0.25% of the GDP of the country.

95% of riders say that comfort is an important reason for choosing to use Uber. It is estimated that Uber saves riders over 17 million hours a year in a year. In fact as per Bangladeshi riders ridesharing is the most significant transport innovation they have experienced in the last decade. 73% of driver-partners said they were satisfied with Uber in 2021. It helps them earn an additional Tk. 522 Million in higher income through Uber or an average of 26% more than their next best alternative source of income or work.

96% of female riders say that safety is an important factor in their choice to use Uber and 72% of female riders agree that it is now easier to get home late at night. 84% of riders without access to a car said the availability of ridesharing services like Uber was important to their choice of not owning a vehicle. In total the report estimates that 1 in 6 Uber trips connect with public transport."

Jennifer Garner just revealed her go-to face sunscreen for hot days.

The 50-year-old shared on Instagram Stories that she uses as her daily face sunscreen.

Customers love the face serum too because it doubles as a makeup primer and blends well.

Jennifer Garner is always down to reveal a beauty secret. From her favorite foundation to her must-have retinol serum to her daily cleanser and hydrating moisturizer  we can count on the actress to give us the details on the newest and best products that won’t break the bank. And with the summer sun still shining bright (and hot!) Garner decided to share the sunscreen serum she uses on set for a radiant and sun-protected complexion:

In a video posted to her Instagram Stories this week Garner shared a snippet of her getting ready for the day in Austin Texas where she is reportedly filming a new limited series . Sitting in the makeup chair with wet hair she held up a bottle of sunscreen—from Neutrogena of course as she is a loyal brand ambassador—and shared the details with her followers.



“When you’re running outside every single scene 103-degrees in Austin Texas what do you use? ” she said while looking into the camera.

Flights used to be a chance to sit back (albeit a bit cramped) and watch a recently released movie or catch up on some reading. Now they’re just another place to log on.

Delta and United each host more than 1.5 million inflight WiFi sessions a month the airlines told CNN Business while JetBlue said its service is used by “millions of customers” every year. Southwest declined to share specific numbers but said inflight Wifi is “popular.”

Alaska Airlines meanwhile estimates that about 35% of its passengers on average make use of its $8 onboard WiFi services which include surfing the web and streaming.

While most airlines will allow certain messaging apps for free full internet access in the skies usually comes at a premium with Delta charging nearly $50 for a monthly pass on US flights (though the airline plans to switch to a $5 per flight per device offering by the end of this year). But with a market that’s currently estimated at around $5 billion and projected to grow to more than $12 billion by 2030 according to research firm Verified Market Research there’s a lot of room for improvement.

Inflight internet has been around for nearly two decades with aircraft manufacturer Boeing announcing its service known as Connexion in April 2000 and debuting it on a Munich-Los Angeles Lufthansa flight in 2004. Boeing discontinued the service in 2006 saying the market for it had “not materialized” as expected. But the advent of smartphones and subsequent efforts by a host of satellite providers and airlines have helped the technology evolve significantly in the past decade — though it still has some catching up to do in order to compare to home and office networks.

How it works

There are two main types of inflight connections. The first known as air-to-ground or ATG relies on antennae attached to the aircraft that catch the signal from cellphone towers on the ground.

Intelsat which launched air-to-ground services with American Airlines in 2008 currently operates a version of the technology on more than 1000 aircraft across North America.

The one major drawback of this technology is that much like cellphone service on the ground it is dependent on the density and connectivity of towers and so flights over rural areas deserts or large water bodies are likely to suffer drops in connectivity. The maximum speeds for these systems are currently around 5 megabits per second (which is shared by hundreds of passengers) according to Andrew Zignani a research director at technology intelligence firm ABI Research who specializes in wireless connectivity. By comparison median global download speeds for mobile and fixed broadband are around 30 megabits per second and 67 megabits per second respectively according to recent data from monitoring app Speedtest.

“To date the biggest issues have been speed limited availability gaps in coverage dropouts and price” Zignani told CNN Business.

That’s why airlines and providers are increasingly switching to satellite-based connections that are relatively less susceptible to interruptions because they can more effectively cover the entirety of the flight path from space and keep the signal active as it moves through the air.

That includes Intelsat which has a network of over 50 satellites serving airlines such as Alaska American Delta United Air Canada British Airways and Cathay Pacific.

“As regional jet fleets are refreshed we expect the majority to migrate to satellite-based solutions” Jeff Sare Intelsat’s president of commercial aviation told CNN Business.

Viasat another major provider used by several airlines around the world uses its own network of satellites that provide high-speed connectivity and is gearing up to launch another satellite constellation later this year. The company debuted its services with JetBlue in 2013 and now serves more than a dozen airlines around the world.

But even satellite connections are currently capable of around 100 megabits per second per aircraft or around 15 megabits per second per passenger device a far cry from the speeds terrestrial WiFi is capable of.

Many airlines use a combination of WiFi providers and types of technologies depending on the type of aircraft and routes they need to be deployed on.

Newer players such as Starlink the satellite internet service run by billionaire Elon Musk’s company SpaceX are also entering the fray. Earlier this year SpaceX announced a partnership with Hawaiian Airlines to provide high-speed internet through Starlink’s network of low-earth orbit satellites.

“Some of these solutions also adopt a hybrid approach combining the best of both technologies to ensure optimal coverage depending on the specific flight path” said Zignani. “I believe we will see opportunities for all technologies in the coming years and recent partnerships are showing that each technology will have its own part to play” he added.

Challenges and opportunities

There are still gaps between inflight WiFi and the networks you would use in your home office a coffee shop or anywhere on the ground.

While most airline WiFi connections now support messaging and social media functions and some even have live TV and video streaming capabilities providing users with the same level of bandwidth and connectivity mid-air can be a challenge.

“The biggest point of difference for inflight WiFi is the complexity added by the mobility element” Don Buchman vice president and general manager for commercial aviation at Viasat told CNN Business. “The aircraft is traveling at a high rate of speed typically banking during the flight and often flying across large geographical areas that demand consistent coverage for a high-quality in-flight connectivity experience.”

And while satellites solve for some of the restrictions that cellphone towers face expanding the satellite network to keep up with increasing demand is not always straightforward.

As Sare of Intelsat puts it: “It is much faster and cheaper to deploy new cellular towers than to launch a satellite on a rocket.”

In a survey by Intelsat last year of airlines service providers and equipment manufacturers 65% of respondents said they anticipate increases in the number of passengers who expect to be connected while flying. The two biggest impediments to increasing inflight WiFi adoption the survey indicated were the high price of the service and “poor internet connection.”

Companies such as Viasat Intelsat and Starlink continue to expand that capacity however launching more satellites every year in anticipation of the growing demand for their services. That added capacity will not only enhance the online experience for users but could also potentially give airlines more avenues to monetize and lower the price.

“One example is ad sponsored inflight WiFi so passengers can access WiFi for free and use it however they would like” Buchman said adding that Viasat is also exploring ways to use its connectivity services to help airlines with functions such as crew management and aircraft maintenance.

The biggest priority according to Sare of Intelsat is shortening the time it takes to make those technological advances happen and he foresees more partnerships between companies to help move the industry standard forward.

Commercial airplanes are still not required to install an added barrier that experts agree will help keep terrorists hijackers and other attackers out of the cockpits.

“The threat and vulnerability remains that we can repeat a September 11th today” Ellen Saracini widow of Capt. Victor Saracini a pilot of doomed United Flight 175 told The Post. He was 51 a father of two girls.

The hijackers sent by Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden brought down four planes on 9/11 two crashing into the World Trade Center one into the Pentagon and one onto a field in Shanksville Pa after brave passengers fought to wrest control before it could reach the White House or US Capitol.

The terrorists did their homework.

8 The secondary barrier looking into the cockpit door space which is installed in many United Airlines planes and the one they used in the study.

“The best time to storm the cockpit would be about 10 to 15 minutes after takeoff when the cockpit doors typically opened for the first time” the 9/11 Commission found.

Other than knives they used to kill 9/11 ringleader Mohamad Atta “did not believe they would need any other weapons. He was confident the cockpit doors would be opened and did not consider breaking them down” the report said.

While cockpit doors are required to stay closed and locked during flight pilots step outside to use the restroom let flight attendants bring in food or switch crews for rest purposes.

After 9/11 Congress mandated airlines to fortify cockpit doors making them virtually impenetrable.

8 Saracini was 51 when he was killed on 9/11. PA Images via Getty Images

But that protection is lost when the doors open. “The flight deck is vulnerable” the Federal Aviation Commission warned in a 2015 advisory.

The solution? Flight attendants are expected to wheel a food or beverage cart in front of the cockpit door and stand by until the door shuts.

“It’s an absurd practice to have flight attendants use their own bodies as the barrier between the cockpit and the cabin” Sara Nelson international president of the Association of Flight Attendants testified to Congress last December.

Since 9/11 the Air Line Pilots Association has called for the mandatory installation of “secondary barriers” — lightweight wire mesh gates several feet outside the cockpit that lock in place before the cockpit door opens and lift after the door shuts.

A video produced by airline employees and shared with Saracini shows the cockpit without a secondary barrier can be stormed in three seconds or less by one or more intruders waiting to pounce — even with a food cart in the way. FAA tests have confirmed the findings.

Two airlines United and Northwest which merged with Delta in 2008 have voluntarily installed lightweight wire barriers costing about $5000 each on “hundreds” of aircraft the pilots union says.

Roughly 5800 jetliners operate in the US.

Meanwhile legislation to mandate secondary barriers fell into a “bureaucratic black hole” the pilots say.

In 2018 – 17 years after 9/11 — Congress finally approved a measure to require secondary barriers but on newly built planes only not existing aircraft.

The FAA was supposed to adopt the limited requirement in 2019 but skipped the deadline. It took the FAA until this past July 27 – another three years – to propose the requirement of secondary barriers on new planes. But after a 60-day public comment period and possibly months more to put out the final rule it will not take effect for two more years – in 2025.

8 “The threats are increasing quicker than we can do the protections” said former FAA agent Brian Sullivan. David McGlynn

Saracini charges the agency has bowed to airline industry pressure.

“The airlines don’t want it and the FAA doesn’t push for it” she said. “They thwart the will of Congress. They don’t care. There’s no regulatory agency that is making the FAA do this.”

The FAA declined to comment but officials said they must follow the “Administrative Procedures Act” which governs how federal agencies develop and issue regulations a slow and tedious process.

8 Mary Schiavo said the holdup to more permanent barriers has to do with money.

Meanwhile thousands of planes currently fly unprotected.

In March 2021 Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick R-Pa and other Congress members sponsored the Saracini Enhanced Aviation Safety Act to require secondary cockpit barriers on all existing passenger aircraft not just new ones. The bill is languishing in committee.

The barriers remain the only 9/11 Commission Report recommendation still not carried out.

An old idea cockpit barriers came up even before 9/11 said Mary Schiavo who was inspector general of the US Transportation Department in the ’90s.

“The issue came up many times but there was always such fierce resistance from the airline industry that proposals really never got anywhere” she said.

The holdup? “Money” she said.

After 9/11 Schiavo and fellow aviation lawyers sued the airlines for negligence — citing the lack of cockpit barriers among other safety failures. The suits reaped more than $500 million in settlements for the families of those killed in the planes.

A 46-page FAA study said the secondary barriers on new planes would cost a one-time $9 million in engineering $35000 per aircraft to install plus training and other minor expenses.

The FAA is finally acting Schiavo believes because it expects another terrorist attack on aircraft in the near future.

8 Saracini left behind his wife and two daughters.

“If they’re putting this forward now I suspect they have enough reason to do so. My guess is they have new intelligence” she said.

“So the threat is real and it’s necessary” she said of the barriers.

Brian Sullivan a former FAA special agent agreed citing possible retaliation for six recent US drone strikes against Al-Shabaab al Qaeda’s branch in East Africa and one in Afghanistan that killed 9/11 mastermind Ayman al-Zawahiri. In other alerts author Salman Rushdie’s stabbing in upstate New York and Iranian plots to assassinate Mike Pompeo and John Bolton.

“The threats are increasing quicker than we can do the protections” said Sullivan who also noted several attempts in the past year to storm cockpits.

Last September it took six or seven crew members to restrain a passenger who went berserk yelling “Allah” on a JetBlue flight from Boston to Puerto Rico when he saw the cockpit door being opened by a pilot. In February an American Airlines flight attendant en route from LA to Washington D.C. bashed an “unruly passenger” on the head with a coffee pot while subduing him with other customers.

Hertz website: www.hertz.com/rentacar

Earlier this year Polestar announced that in partnership with Hertz they’d begin delivery of Polestar EVs to select Hertz locations.

According to Inside EVs Polestar has a goal to deliver 65000 of its EVs to U.S. dealerships over the next five years.

While according to Polestar’s press release the majority of those Polestar EVs headed to Hertz rental locations would be Polestar 2s towards the bottom they mention

“…In addition Hertz is now adding the Polestar 1 electric performance hybrid to their Dream fleet as well to allow customers to experience the high-performance carbon fiber sports GT firsthand.”

Theoretically that means anyone at least 25 years old with a valid driver’s license and even just a debit card can for a rental fee rent Polestar’s 600 HP Halo car.

The issue as most can already guess is Polestar only made 1500 Polestar 1s over a three-year production span with 150 Polestar 1s every year (or 450 total) earmarked for the United States.

There aren’t many Polestar 1s driving around the United States so you can imagine how many will end up in Hertz dealerships not many.

So where can you rent a Polestar 1?

I plugged in a handful of locations into Hertz and this is what I found.

I plugged in at least a half dozen of the largest airports with Hertz Rentals in the United States including a handful of the largest cities by population and you can only rent a Polestar 1 from the San Francisco International Airport (SFO) Hertz and the Los Angeles International Airport LAX) Hertz locations (but don’t quote me on that.)

Lucky you if you’re arriving into either city or live within driving distance of said airports as as of this blog post Polestar 1s have a daily rate of just $229 (or $259 after taxes) and that’s unlimited miles too.

Add on the mandatory $61 in fees and for one day you can rent the Polestar 1 for just $319.

Here’s a screenshot of what that looks like.

$319 gets you into a Polestar 1 for the day.

One day not enough?

I plugged in an entire week (7-days) and your total comes out to $1937.16.

That’s a lot or a little depending on how big your pockets are.

Then again we’re talking about a rare $155000 plug-in hybrid here.

If you’re a big time exec that’s a blip on the business trip budget (i.e. let the company pay for it.)

So if you’re itching to give the Polestar 1 an extended test drive for at least an entire day and want to rent one with the ease of a Hertz rental you only need $319.",,,,,,,,,

Chile’s present constitution is a holdover from the rule of Augusto Pinochet the military leader who took over the country after overthrowing democratically elected socialist President Salvador Allende in 1973. That constitution originally written in 1981 upholds the free-market policies that buoyed Chile’s economy. But according to opponents it caused staggering inequality. That inequality symbolized by a subway fare hike in the capital city of Santiago ignited widespread protests in 2019; a year later nearly 80 percent of the population voted to replace the constitution.

The vote is monumental in many ways; it’s a test of 36-year-old President Gabriel Boric’s leftist government as well as of the constituent assembly which wrote the new document. It’s also a reminder of the critical role that the plebiscite has played in Chile’s political history. And it could turn Chilean society from fairly conservative to one of Latin America’s most liberal should it pass.

Chile’s new constitution would uproot the remnants of its brutal dictatorship

The call for a new constitution solidified during Chile’s 2019 mass protests which took place across the nation starting in October of that year. Leftist student groups demanding systemic change and ordinary Chileans suffering from the country’s severe economic inequality gathered in the streets for months defying government curfews and sometimes clashing with police.

Although Chile has been fairly stable and economically prosperous in the latter part of the 20th century that prosperity hasn’t touched everyone equally. The country scores high on the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s inequality index and its employment rate has been persistently lower than in most other developed countries as has its public spending on primary and secondary education according to a 2021 economic report from the OECD.

The country’s student movement has long been a powerful force in Chilean politics starting under Pinochet and continuing under subsequent civilian presidencies to subvert government attempts to restrict their rights to protest as well as the state’s public-private education model which former President Sebastián Piñera endorsed during his first term. Widespread protests in 2011 against this model which students said reinforced inequality were led mostly by university and graduate students — including now-president Boric.

Protesters back in 2011 called for the abolition of government subsidies for private schools and more funding for public education; the new constitution if approved would guarantee the right to free education as well as housing and health care.

It’s also in a sense a repudiation of Pinochet’s legacy. Under his brutal regime from 1973 to 1990 no meaningful political opposition was allowed. As many as 3400 people were forcibly disappeared tortured and murdered by the state security services according to the International Commission on Missing Persons and tens of thousands more suffered severe human rights abuses according to Chile’s National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation. But Pinochet valued free-market principles and worked to make them a critical part of the Chilean economy.

According to a Congressional report issued in 1975 on the US’s covert actions in Chile the US government in a bid to keep Allende and his socialist policies out of power sought to punish the Chilean economy to show how the global economy would react should Allende assume the presidency. It was in this landscape that after a US-assisted coup Pinochet took control and in the 1980s sought to reform the economy lowering tariffs inviting foreign investment capitalizing on a copper boom and joining trade agreements with other nations in the Americas.

Pinochet’s economic reforms and the relative prosperity they brought couldn’t possibly outweigh the horrors his regime committed against the Chilean people. In Chile’s 1980 constitution Pinochet set out a plan for a 1988 plebiscite; on that date people could vote on whether they wanted to keep him in office for a further eight years. A concerted national campaign and unified opposition defeated Pinochet making way for the 1990 presidential election that finally pushed him out.

But many of Pinochet’s economic ideas persisted. After decades of growth the economy stagnated in the 2010s despite increases in basic expenses. By 2019 the poor had little access to high-quality health care and education depending instead on underfunded state resources; the middle class forced to pay for privatized services including water access and toll roads risked crushing debt as Richard Feinberg wrote for the Brookings Institution at the time.

Piñera the right-wing billionaire president then in his second term called out the military and imposed a state of emergency claiming “We are at war against a powerful enemy who is willing to use violence without any limits.” Though the protests did bring about some looting and violence — ultimately about 30 people were killed — they also brought about an agreement to vote on whether and how to adopt a new constitution.

The proposed constitution is an unusual document

On October 25 2020 the vast majority of Chileans voted to write a new constitution — and to elect the 155 people who would write it. The Pinochet-era constitution had been amended several times under democratic presidents and former President Michelle Bachelet proposed a new constitution five days before the end of her term in 2018. But Piñera abandoned the project when he entered office — until he could no longer ignore people’s desire for change and congress proposed the two-part plebiscite in 2019.

The new constitution was written by a constituent group elected by the Chilean people. The assembly had as its president first a linguist then an epidemiologist both women and was primarily made up of liberal and independent members hence the strong push for equality gender parity environmental protection and social services. The assembly also had 17 seats reserved for members of Chile’s two million strong Indigenous population.

The final draft submitted July 4 of this year gives unprecedented rights to Indigenous communities granting sovereignty over their territories and installing an Indigenous judicial system to try cases particular to those nations. The new constitution also enforces Indigenous representation at all levels of government as well as gender parity in government and in both public and public-private enterprises the Washington Post reports.

The new constitution is something quite revolutionary particularly in comparison to its predecessor; it enshrines the right to “voluntary interruption of [a] pregnancy” in a country where abortion was illegal until 2017.

It recognizes the rights of LGBTQ people ensures access to education health care water and adequate housing and seeks to broaden the reach of scientific and technological advancement across Chile. The new constitution also recognizes the rights of nature providing a legal mechanism for environmental protection even if people aren’t directly harmed by a particular environmental degradation.

“In a country where it seemed like nothing could change” it is a monument to change as constitutional assembly member Bárbara Sepúlveda told the Washington Post. But for some the change may prove to be too much; because the assembly was overwhelmingly leftist and independent no conservative voice or coalition was able to counter its progressive policies. Alberto Lyon an attorney interviewed by the Post voted for a new constitution but called the draft “a disaster” because “it changes the entire political system.”

Lyon also accused the draft constitution of being “indigenist”; other criticisms have been levied at that particular aspect of the new constitution with some Chileans — even Indigenous Chileans — expressing concern about the Indigenous justice system and the constitution’s designation of the country as “plurinational” recognizing Indigenous nations within Chile.

For others misinformation has played a part in their distrust of the draft. According to Axios some claims including that people would no longer be allowed to own private property under the new constitution and that people would be able to get an abortion into the ninth month of pregnancy may have crushed support for the new document.

Polling has seen support for the new constitution drop to 37 percent although it’s impossible to know how much social media misinformation and half-truths — as opposed to people’s fear of change — contributed to the polling numbers. Chileans are still at the voting booths though and this is a mandatory vote meaning that the final numbers could be quite different.

Regardless of Sunday’s outcome Boric promised in July that Chile will eventually get a new constitution because citizens demanded it in the 2020 vote. At the time he said in an interview that the process would start from scratch should Chileans reject the current proposal. “The constitutional process if rejected” he said “has to continue by the terms decided by the people of Chile.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbHR3aXJlLmNvbS9hdGxhbnRpYy1jYW5hZGEvb3Bpbmlvbi9nYWlsLWxldGhicmlkZ2UtdGltZS10by1icmVhay10YWJvby1vbi1wcml2YXRlLWhlYWx0aC1jYXJlLTEwMDc2ODg3NS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GAIL LETHBRIDGE: Time to break taboo on private health care,"It would be disingenuous to say we don’t already have private health care in Canada.

With pressures and crises circling like vultures over our health-care system there is the inevitable talk of privatization.

The very word — privatization — sends shivers down the spines of many Canadians who have built a national identity on the principle of universal health care. Like our beloved hockey universal health care is part of our story.

So talk of privatization is scary especially when we look south of the border.

But the thing is private health care is already here and it has been for some time.

Consider the following:

If I need a therapeutic massage to treat back pain from spending too much time at a computer I get a referral from my family doctor to receive treatment at a private clinic. That is private.

If people need a dietician physiotherapist podiatrist or psychologist they go to private health-care providers.

Glasses prosthetics hearing aids or an ambulance — these services all operate on a private model.

And drugs. If a family doctor prescribes a medication you pay the private pharmacist. Dental work is the same. And there are many other services that are delivered by the private sector.

These services and therapies are essential and fundamental to our health. And they are delivered by the private sector.

That said if you have a heart attack or a car crash and require immediate treatment you will receive it at no charge via the public system.

Cancer treatments and most essential surgeries are provided by the universal system but people will have to wait not only for surgeries but for diagnostic procedures that define the problem and determine the need for surgical and medical intervention.

In some cases patients may have to wait for months or years for procedures. These kinds of delays could push their condition into a life-and-death crisis.

We have been talking about the health-care crisis for years. It has been long predicted that an aging population would create the double whammy of increased demand for care and a declining supply of health-care workers due to retirements.

The pandemic amplified the problems and shone a light on the weaknesses of a system designed to react to disease or accidents. The burdens of virus-related illness and restrictions — combined with demographic trends — have pushed the crisis to a new level.

If there is anything we can all agree upon it is that something has to change.

So maybe we can find answers in the ways we are already doing things and consider further integration of private services to augment the overwhelmed public system.

Nova Scotia now has an arrangement with a private surgery provider which delivers elective and outpatient surgeries. There are also partnerships between public health and private dental and vision clinics.

They could make similar arrangements with a diagnostic service such as an MRI clinic. We already have a private business delivering this service to paying clients in an efficient and timely manner.

The public system could partner with this service and use it to reduce long waiting lists for use of publicly owned MRI machines. This would expedite important diagnostics for patients who may or may not require further treatment. The public system would foot the bill.

Extracting individual services from the grips of a labyrinthine system and delivering them in private clinics would address backlogs. This is one relatively simple approach that would address patient needs quickly in addition to reinventing Big Health Care which will take longer.

Yes this will prompt fears of “privatization creep.” There will also be legitimate questions of robbing public Peter to pay private Paul with staffing.

But it’s time to think beyond paradigms that have landed us here. Canadians in need of health care should not be sacrificed on the altar of a universal system that isn’t really universal.

It wouldn’t necessarily save money but it might be one avenue to speed up the delivery of services to patients in need.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRic25ld3MubmV0L2Vjb25vbXkvY29ycG9yYXRlcy91bml2ZXJzYWwtbWVkaWNhbC1zZXJ2aWNlcy1sdGQtc3RhcnRzLW9wZXJhdGlvbnMtYnJhaG1hbmJhcmlhLTQ4OTk1NNIBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRic25ld3MubmV0L2Vjb25vbXkvY29ycG9yYXRlcy91bml2ZXJzYWwtbWVkaWNhbC1zZXJ2aWNlcy1sdGQtc3RhcnRzLW9wZXJhdGlvbnMtYnJhaG1hbmJhcmlhLTQ4OTk1ND9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Universal Medical Services Ltd starts operations in Brahmanbaria,"Universal Medical Services Limited started its operations in Brahmanbaria on Saturday (3 September).

These are flash floods to be exact which are caused by rapid and excessive rainfall that raises water heights quickly overtaking rivers streams channels and roads.

Due to climate change Pakistan has experienced excessive rains this monsoon season 2.87 times higher than its national average of the last 30 years with some areas in Sindh and Balochistan receiving more than five times the average rainfall.

Floods are the most frequently occurring natural disaster. Globally 80% to 90% of all natural disasters in the last 10 years have comprised flash floods river floods or coastal floods. The waters sweep away everything in their path. Ill-planned infrastructure quickly collapses causing loss of human and animal life. The international experience with floods shows that 75% of deaths during the floods take place due to drowning.

People suffer during floods in many different ways. All of a sudden they are washed away with their belongings and in most cases lose their livelihoods. They are uprooted from their homes and communities they get separated from their loved ones and there is no longer any social support. As a result they undergo extreme mental stress and in many cases suffer physically.

An integral component

Healthcare is an integral component of any flood emergency response. However well-meaning but inappropriate or unrelated medical aid and donations may do more harm than good. So in order to plan an appropriate medical response it first needs to be understood what most frequently afflicts people during floods.

It is useful to think in terms of five groups of medical and healthcare problems during floods and the corresponding healthcare provision.

The first group of problems are of an acute nature and require immediate medical response. These include injuries that are caused by floodwater and the people’s struggle to save themselves from drowning hypothermia due to being submerged in water for a prolonged period injuries due to the collapse of buildings and infrastructure and snakebites.

The second group of problems follows the first one in the form of the spread of waterborne diseases including but not limited to diarrhoea especially among children cholera typhoid and hepatitis E. Malaria and dengue though mosquito-borne diseases also spread during these times due to stagnant water pools which serve as breeding sites for mosquitoes.

The provision of safe drinking water and food are critical not only for hydration and nutritional purposes but also to prevent the spread of waterborne diseases. Along with that the promotion of handwashing sanitation and other infection prevention and control measures need to be promoted.

Officials say planes carrying fresh aid from the United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan have landed at an airport near Pakistan’s capital. Officials say the flights are part of the humanitarian air bridge established last month after floods left 1208 dead. https://t.co/Kshg9KrviB — The Associated Press (@AP) September 2 2022

With a growing number of environmental samples already testing positive for the poliovirus and increasing polio cases there is a need to carry out special polio vaccination campaigns in the flood-affected areas as and when possible.

Poliovirus can contaminate food and water in unsanitary conditions. Likewise cholera vaccination should be considered to control likely cholera outbreaks. Measles outbreaks must also be anticipated in camps. Covid-19 vaccination should also be considered for people living in these areas.

The third set of problems comprise those which people were already suffering from but whose treatment was disrupted due to the flood emergency. Here an understanding of the proportionate burden of diseases in Pakistan would be helpful. More than 50% of the burden of disease in Pakistan is now due to non-communicable diseases. These are chronic conditions usually requiring lifelong treatment. Diabetes especially needs to be mentioned. Insulin and other antidiabetic medicines are a lifeline for patients with diabetes. Likewise patients with blood pressure chronic respiratory problems etc require their medication to be continued.

Mental health challenges

The fourth group includes mental health issues. The stress of loss causes anxiety and depression. Mental health support to the flood-affected must be planned as a part of medical aid and it should not be relegated to non-essential care or as an afterthought. Trained mental health professionals should be part of the medical team.

Fifth are vulnerable groups and their special needs. Pregnant women young children old women and men disabled people – all require special and prioritised attention to their condition and needs in times of emergencies.

Planning healthcare for flood victims hence requires not only medical (curative) services but also preventive promotive and rehabilitative health services. These five groups of problems can guide us in the selection of medicines and other medical supplies and the composition of healthcare teams.

Time and again it has been witnessed that indiscriminate medicine donations by families and companies during emergencies actually cause huge problems in terms of their disposal. This must be avoided.

Hard to comprehend the scale of the flood disaster in Pakistan the 5th most populated nation in the world.



Nearly 1400 dead 1 million houses damaged or destroyed and 50000000 people displaced.

The World Health Organisation has invested in developing and supplying a number of standard emergency health kits and has improved these kits over the years learning from emergency experiences around the world. Of special relevance to the floods are their Interagency Emergency Health Kit which is good to serve the medical needs of 10000 people for three months. Another one is the Cholera Kit-2020 which can serve the needs of 100 patients. All those interested in providing medical support can get a lot of guidance from the WHO kits. Much of this information is available on the WHO website.

The weak primary healthcare system in the country superimposed by the flood disaster requires the strengthening of the health system capacity in the affected and adjacent areas. Primary health centres must be strengthened to whatever capacity is possible.

At the same time organised medical camps and field hospitals need to be set up. China and Cuba have vast experience in setting up and managing field hospitals during emergencies around the world as we witnessed during the 2005 earthquake and 2010 floods in Pakistan.

Well-coordinated disaster management operations to rescue people from the flood-hit areas and then providing them relief and support in resettling is what is expected from the government. The quality of disaster management however is directly proportional to what preparation and readiness there is to respond when there is no emergency.

Hong Menea

A senior Ministry of Health official announced that a draft Primary Health Care Booster Implementation Framework (PHC-BIF) for Cambodia is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year. The implementation will be rolled out across the Kingdom in stages.

The announcement followed a two-day consultative workshop on the draft framework late last week.

Or Vandine ministry secretary of state and chair of the Primary Health Care Booster Taskforce said the draft was based on lessons learned from the Kingdom’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic. She noted that the participation of individuals families and communities were key factors in the response.

“In the next 10 to 20 years we expect our people to change their habits and lifestyles so they are healthier and to promote the responsibility of individuals families and communities for primary healthcare” she said.

“Initially we will select five locations – which may be villages or communes in just four or five provinces – which the team will use as trial rollouts so we can adapt our techniques if necessary” said Vandine.

The next step would be to expand the campaign from each village and commune until the programme had been introduced into whole provinces.

“As we expand the programme we will be carrying out constant evaluations using our ‘Do Adopt and Archive’ approach” she said.

She added that the final stage would include implementing the programme nationwide.

“We project that we will have achieved nationwide implementation of the primary healthcare programme by 2030 although we are still in the very early stages. We only began drafting the policy at the beginning of this year” she said.

“We expect to have the framework prepared by the end of the year but in fact our progress has been so good that I think October may be a realistic goal for its completion” she added.

At the September 2 workshop health minister Mam Bun Heng said the health sector has made significant progress especially in maternal and child health – including immunisation – and has also reduced infant mortality rates.

Bun Heng said the PHC-BIF framework is an excellent way to achieve universal healthcare coverage and sustainable development goals.

“It will bring key healthcare services closer to communities and people in need such as the poor and vulnerable. That was why the working group to manage the programme was established earlier this year” he said."

La idea de la conveniencia del cliente fue citada con mayor frecuencia por las tiendas de abarrotes y de conveniencia que presionaron a la Legislatura de Texas para que cambiara la ley que prohibía la venta de cerveza y vino los domingos por la mañana según reporta el Dallas Morning News.

Las tiendas dicen que no están teniendo pérdidas sustanciales en ventas de cerveza y vino que ahora comienzan a las 10 a. m. los domingos en lugar del mediodía. Desde que cambió la ley la recaudación mensual total de impuestos sobre las ventas de las tiendas de comestibles y conveniencia habría aumentado con respecto al año anterior.

Y es que los iPhone de Apple son tan populares que en mercados como el estadounidense han superado a Android siendo esta la primera vez que se consigue en Estados Unidos.

En España generalmente cuando hablamos de comprar un iPhone la mayoría de personas consideran que son demasiado caros para lo que ofrecen. Y es que teniendo smartphones con sistema operativo Android cada vez más potentes comprar un móvil para nuestro día a día acaba saliendo barato. Así para la inmensa mayoría de personas un teléfono básico que ronda los 100 o 200 euros es más que suficiente aunque no obtienes lo mismo que te da un iPhone claro. Esto va desde una mejor cámara mayor rendimiento y fluidez (aunque pase el tiempo) el sistema operativo iOS o la calidad de sus materiales.

Por primera vez hay más iPhones que Androids en Estados Unidos

Apple acaba de lograr una hazaña que pocos consideraban que fuera posible ganar a su principal rival en el mercado móvil los smartphones Android. Estos que han ofrecido una gama de precios que va desde móviles muy baratos hasta precios superiores a un iPhone 13 Pro Max ha sido la opción preferente durante más de una década. Sin embargo esto ha cambiado ahora pues la empresa de análisis Counterpoint Research ha mostrado que Apple ha ganado esta vez. Y es que el iPhone superó a Android en ventas durante junio y logró alcanzar el 50% de la cuota del mercado de Estados Unidos.

Esta sería la mayor cuota de mercado alcanzada por Apple en la historia en el sector de los smartphones. Esto se conoció gracias a la ""base instalada activa"" que indica la cantidad de usuarios que utilizan iOS. Sin embargo en el resto del mundo Apple no ha logrado alcanzar esa cifra aunque tampoco está muy lejos. Esto sorprende pues la diferencia de precio entre un iPhone estándar y un Android de gama de entrada o gama media es muy grande.

En el resto del mundo el iPhone supone un 28% de los móviles

Si vemos la gráfica de la derecha tenemos la progresión de la cuota de mercado que ha ido alcanzando Android iOS y otros sistemas operativos antiguos. Por ejemplo vemos que en 2010 los Blackberry seguían siendo usados pues tenían cerca del 20% de la cuota de mercado y superaban a Android la cual no paró de crecer. Apenas tres años después en 2013 Android pasó del 10% a casi un 50% haciendo que los iPhone siempre quedaran en un segundo puesto en ventas.

Actualmente según datos de agosto de 2022 Android constituye el 7154% de los smartphones a nivel mundial mientras que Apple con iOS se queda con un 2781% mientras que lo restante va para Samsung y otras. De hecho si vamos a los datos en Europa Apple alcanza casi un tercio del mercado con un 3183%. Así pues el único país donde Apple ha logrado conseguir ese asombroso 50% y ganar a Android ha sido en Estados Unidos. No obstante como vemos en el resto del mundo sigue siendo muy vendido pues a pesar de su mayor precio sus ventas siguen creciendo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlcmlvZGljb2N1YmFuby5jb20vZ29ycmlvbi10ZXh0by1zb2JyZS1taWdyYWNpb24tY3ViYW5hLWVuY2FiZXphLXZlbnRhcy1kZS1sYW56YW1pZW50b3MtZW4tZXNwYW5vbC1kZS1hbWF6b24v0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGVyaW9kaWNvY3ViYW5vLmNvbS9nb3JyaW9uLXRleHRvLXNvYnJlLW1pZ3JhY2lvbi1jdWJhbmEtZW5jYWJlemEtdmVudGFzLWRlLWxhbnphbWllbnRvcy1lbi1lc3Bhbm9sLWRlLWFtYXpvbi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Gorrión’ texto sobre la migración cubana: encabeza ventas de lanzamientos en Amazon,"Compila nueve historias donde confluyen el desarraigo y al mismo tiempo esa sensación de estar atados para siempre a la tierra que te vio nacer

‘Gorrión’ un libro de la autoría de la actriz Rebeca Proenza cuya esencia es la migración cubana encabeza las ventas de nuevos lanzamientos en español de Amazon.

El texto de 207 páginas consta de nueve capítulos en los que se «cuenta un modo de escape diferente en su mayoría ilegal» que de acuerdo a su creadora narran «cuál es su sueño americano y en qué se convierten al emigrar».

Sobre la base testimonial aunque con nombres cambiados la joven radicada en los Estados Unidos ha logrado hilvanar un sentimiento común en el periodo comprendido desde el triunfo del castrismo en 1959 hasta el 2022; el desarraigo y al mismo tiempo esa sensación de estar atados para siempre a la tierra que te vio nacer.

«Los capítulos están entrelazados entre ellos hay una familia que se desintegra a través de los años. Está la persona que salió por el Mariel un señor que caminó hasta la Base Naval de Guantánamo en 1968 para entregarse. Hay una señora que sale de Cuba con 65 años reclamada legalmente y lo único que trae es una cartera con las cartas de amor de su difunto marido» comentó Proenza a Diario de Cuba.

Con imágenes ilustraciones y diseño de portada de artista cubano Kadir López Nieves ‘Gorrión’ en su propio nombre encierra disímiles significados. Un ave que vuela en busca de la libertad y también en buena parte de Cuba por ejemplo en Holguín de donde es originaria Rebeca se conoce de ese modo a la añoranza la sensación de vacío en el pecho que se siente al extrañar demasiado.

«El día que emigré me volví también mucho más cubana. En mi país era una ciudadana común parte del ajetreo y de la vida cotidiana. Nunca tuve que decir de donde vengo ni explicarme a mi misma. Ahora soy “la cubana” en cualquier lugar del mundo que habite. Luzco hablo cocino bailo y me comporto diferente. Pudiera decir que lo dejé todo atrás pero lo cierto es que cargo todo un país conmigo» ha señalado la también modelo sobre el fuerte sentido de pertenencia e identidad cubana que siempre le acompaña.

Por si quedara alguna duda como invitación y «aperitivo» de lo que le espera al lector en su contraportada el libro se anuncia como «un relato a corazón abierto de los que se tienen en los días de nostalgia bajo un exceso de confianza. La única diferencia es que no espero que se guarde el secreto».

Y sin dudas ese secreto dejó de serlo al convertirse de memorias personales a colectivas; al dibujar una nación que hoy se encuentra en fuga en la que muchos de sus habitantes quisieran al menos tener las alas de ese gorrión para emprender su vuelo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL2VsY29tZXJjaW8ucGUvbHVjZXMvY2luZS90b3AtZ3VuLW1hdmVyaWNrLWJhdGUtcmVjb3JkLWRlLXZlbnRhcy1lbi1mb3JtYXRvLWRpZ2l0YWwtZW4tZWV1dS10b20tY3J1aXNlLXVzYS1lc3RhZG9zLXVuaWRvcy1jZWxlYnMtcm1tbi1ub3RpY2lhL9IBpAFodHRwczovL2VsY29tZXJjaW8ucGUvbHVjZXMvY2luZS90b3AtZ3VuLW1hdmVyaWNrLWJhdGUtcmVjb3JkLWRlLXZlbnRhcy1lbi1mb3JtYXRvLWRpZ2l0YWwtZW4tZWV1dS10b20tY3J1aXNlLXVzYS1lc3RhZG9zLXVuaWRvcy1jZWxlYnMtcm1tbi1ub3RpY2lhLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,“Top Gun: Maverick” bate récord de ventas en formato digital en EE.UU. y consigue recaudación millonaria,"La película “Top Gun: Maverick” sigue batiendo récords y se sitúa ahora como el filme más vendido en formato digital durante su primera semana de lanzamiento en dicho soporte anunció este viernes Paramount que no da no obstante las cifras concretas.

La película protagonizada por Tom Cruise también se encuentra ya entre los filmes más vendidos en formato digital de toda la historia de Estados Unidos a pesar de haber salido al mercado hace apenas nueve días.

En este nuevo soporte “Top Gun: Maverick” incluye 110 minutos de contenido adicional en los que puede verse parte del rodaje y del proceso de producción de esta película que requirió un avión diseñado especialmente para la grabación y diversos cursos de pilotaje para sus protagonistas.

Además cuenta con dos videos musicales de Lady Gaga y la banda estadounidense OneRepublic con las canciones que compusieron para la cinta.

Paramount no ha revelado la cifra total de ventas que ha cosechado por el momento este formato digital pero aseguran haber hecho un seguimiento teniendo en cuenta “recursos de la industria análisis independientes y la percepción de empresas de distribución” afirmó un representante del estudio al medio Variety.

Es el caso de Amazon la versión digital de la película fue el producto más vendido de todas sus categorías en Estados Unidos el pasado 23 de agosto día en que salió al mercado.

En otras plataformas dedicadas a la difusión de filmes en ‘streaming’ previo pago como es el caso de Vudu perteneciente al conglomerado NBCUniversal esta producción ha sido la más consumida desde su lanzamiento y el paquete que va acompañado de la primera entrega “Top Gun” el más vendido.

Después de esta buena aceptación “Top Gun: Maverick” estará disponible en los formatos 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray y DVD a partir del próximo 1 de noviembre.

La segunda parte de “Top Gun” sigue los pasos del intrépido piloto Pete ‘Maverick’ Mitchell quien lleva más de 30 años desempeñándose como uno de los mejores aviadores y ahora trabaja como entrenador para misiones especiales de un grupo de graduados entre los que se encuentra ‘Goose’ el hijo de uno de sus mejores amigos.

Desde su estreno hace catorce semanas “Top Gun: Maverick” ha conseguido revitalizar la taquilla mundial tras la pandemia con una recaudación total de 1.400 millones de dólares convirtiéndose en la sexta película más exitosa de la historia y también la más vista de toda la carrera del actor Tom Cruise.

Aunque no todo son buenas noticias para Paramount que ha sido demandado tras el estreno de esta cinta después de que los herederos del periodista Ehud Yonay quien escribió un artículo en 1983 en el que se inspiró el argumento de la primera versión consideran que se han vulnerado sus derechos de autor.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlc2FyZ2VudGluYS5jb20vbmVnb2Npb3Mva2lhLWF1bWVudGEtMTA0LXN1cy12ZW50YXMtbXVuZGlhbGVzLWFnb3N0by1uMjE0ODHSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXNhcmdlbnRpbmEuY29tL25lZ29jaW9zL2tpYS1hdW1lbnRhLTEwNC1zdXMtdmVudGFzLW11bmRpYWxlcy1hZ29zdG8tbjIxNDgxL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kia aumenta un 104% sus ventas mundiales en agosto,"En el acumulado del año las ventas de Kia crecieron un 08% en comparación con el año anterior sumando un total de 192 millones de unidades.

And to be sure the top plans that come packed with perks still cost a pretty penny if you turn to AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon.

Unlimited data plans and phone deals These days a lot of phone deals offered by the big carriers require you to sign up for a qualified unlimited data plan to get a discount on a new device. The key word there is ""qualifying."" Some times the cheapest unlimited data plans at AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon are included in these deals and sometimes they're left out. Check each offer carefully to make sure you're getting the right unlimited data plan.

But back in 2018 T-Mobile rolled out Essentials a stripped-down version of its unlimited data plan available at a lower price. Eventually T-Mobile's biggest competitors — perhaps feeling pressured from the best cheap cell phone plans that also include low-cost unlimited data — took notice.

In the past year AT&T and Verizon have both added entry-level unlimited data plans of their own. You won't find much in the way of perks but you may not mind when your cell phone bill arrives at the end of each month.

Knowing what unlimited data plans are out there is especially vital at this time of year when phone makers are rolling out their fall flagship devices. Samsung just introduced the Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Galaxy Z Flip 4 its latest foldables and the iPhone 14 should soon be arriving from Apple. If you're in the market for a new phone it may pay to look for a new wireless plan as well — particularly one that doesn't charge you a lot for unlimited talk text and data.

With that in mind we wanted to compare the lowest-priced unlimited data plans available at the three major phone carriers. You'll find less expensive options at mobile virtual network operators or MVNOs and AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon all offer more feature-packed plans at higher monthly rates. But consider this cheap unlimited data phone plan comparison a good starting point for understanding the going rate for unlimited data these days — especially if you run across the best cell phone deals that require you to sign up for an unlimited data plan.

Cheap unlimited data plans: AT&T Value Plus Plan

What it costs one line: $50/month

What it costs four lines: N/A

AT&T's Value Plus plan is ideal for people who just need one line of unlimited data and don't require a lot of perks. For just $50 a month Value Plus gives you talk text and data with no limits though AT&T reserves the right to slow your data speeds if its network is congested. That's what separates Value Plus from more expensive AT&T unlimited plans which include a set amount of ""premium data"" or high-speed data that you can use without having to worry about throttling.

AT&T includes 5G coverage through its nationwide network with the Value Plus plan and you'll be able to use your talk text and data when traveling in Mexico or Canada. You can also enjoy unlimited texting from the U.S. to 200-plus countries. But that's about it when it comes to perks.

The biggest limitation with AT&T's Value Plus plan is that families can't take advantage of it — AT&T restricts Value Plus pricing to just one line. If you want to add multiple lines you'll have to opt for one of AT&T's more expensive unlimited plans like the AT&T Unlimited Starter plan ($140 for four lines or $35/line) or AT&T Unlimited Extra ($160 for four lines or $40/line). Of course those plans come with extra perks.

AT&T Value Plus plan: $50/month @ AT&T

AT&T's cheapest unlimited plan doesn't offer perks but it is the least expensive option for unlimited data among the big three phone carriers. Only individuals can take advantage of this deal as AT&T doesn't let you add extra lines of data.

AT&T's next cheapest plan: AT&T Unlimited Stater costs $65 a month for a single line of data. That extra $15/month gets you 3GB of mobile hotspot data per line and you can add multiple lines. Otherwise perks aren't that much different from the Value Plus plan. If you aren't sure either of these is the plan for you it's worth looking at our AT&T Mobility promo codes for other ways to save.

Cheap unlimited data plans: T-Mobile Essentials plan

What it costs one line: $60/month

What it costs four lines: $105/month ($26.25 per line)

T-Mobile's Magenta plan gets all the hype but there's a cheaper option than the $70/month unlimited plan that's the carrier's flagship offering. T-Mobile Essentials offers unlimited data for less though the perks aren't as generous as what you would get with Magenta or the even more expensive Magenta Plus option.

Still Essentials offers more perks than you might expect. In addition to 5G coverage from T-Mobile's top-ranked 5G network you can enjoy unlimited hotspot data though it's restricted to 3G speeds. You can enjoy 50GB of unlimited data before T-Mobile can slow your speeds which gives Essentials a leg up over the cheap unlimited plans from AT&T and Verizon.

Normally to get streaming services included with your wireless plan you have to pay up for more expensive options but Essentials customers do get a year of Paramount Plus for free.

Unlike AT&T's Value Plus plan Essentials supports multiple lines. As of this writing a four-line plan costs $105/month or $26.25 for each line. But note that reflects a current promotion where T-Mobile is waiving the fee on the third line of data. Normally four lines of Essentials will set you back $140 each month.

One big drawback to T-Mobile Essentials is that the rate doesn't include taxes and fees. Other T-Mobile unlimited plans bake taxes and fees into the monthly rate so that you're always paying the same amount.

T-Mobile Essentials Plan: $60/month @ T-Mobile

T-Mobile has the best perks among major carriers for its cheapest unlimited data plan with unlimited hotspot data (at 3G speeds) and a year of Paramount Plus included. Even better you get 50GB of premium data so your speeds won't be slowed if T-Mobile's network is congested.

T-Mobile's next cheapest plan: From Essentials you can step up to the $70/month Magenta plan which will cost a family of four $140 total thanks to that discounted third line. Magenta doubles your premium data cap to 100GB and your hotspot speeds increase to high-speed with a 5GB cap. Multi-line plans get a free Netflix subscription and there are travel benefits like in-flight Wi-Fi too.

Cheap unlimited data plans: Verizon Welcome Unlimited

What it costs one line: $65/month

What it costs four lines: $120/month ($30 per line)

Verizon's Welcome Unlimited is the relative newcomer to this mix of cheap unlimited plans giving you a low entry price for unlimited data through Verizon's far-reach service. You can also get 5G coverage through Welcome Unlimited though that's via Verizon's nationwide 5G network and not the much faster C-Band and mmWave-based 5G available in select cities.

As is commonplace among these cheap unlimited plans perks are few and far between with Welcome Unlimited. You can expect to enjoy talk text and data when you travel to Mexico and Canada but that's about it. Verizon will slow your speeds if you its network gets congested.

Welcome Unlimited's greatest appeal is for families where escalating discounts drop the per-line cost to $30 each month for four lines of data. While Verizon's other unlimited data plans let you mix and match plans you don't have that luxury with Welcome Unlimited.

Verizon Welcome Unlimited Plan: $65/month @ Verizon

Verizon's cheapest unlimited data plan is best for families as the discounts on additional lines drops to the per-line cost to $30 each; that's $120 total. You get 5G coverage from Verizon's nationwide network.

Verizon's next cheapest plan: If you want more perks with your unlimited data the next step up at Verizon is the 5G Start plan which costs $70 a month for just one line. Families pay $35/line for four lines of data. The extra perks include 5GB of hotspot data plus assorted 6-month streaming trials to Disney Plus Discovery Plus Apple Music and whichever gaming service (Apple Arcade or Google Play Pass) strikes your fancy. 5G Play More with its more extensive benefits ups your cost to $80/month. You can also check our Verizon promo codes for other ways to save.

Other cheap unlimited data plans

There are cheaper unlimited plans available if you're willing to look beyond the major wireless carriers turning instead to discount services. Mint Mobile for example charges $30 a month for its unlimited plan though after a three-month trial you need to pay for a full year of service to get that low rate.

Visible which just shuffled up its plans now charges $30 a month for its entry-level unlimited plan without the year commitment that Mint requires. For $45 a month Visible includes perks like international calling and texting plus access to Verizon's fastest 5G network. (Visible is owned by Verizon and uses that carrier's network for coverage.) Tello offers the cheapest unlimited data plan by a $1 charging $29 for unlimited talk text and data.

As we noted with Visible these discount services use the big carriers' towers for their service — Verizon's in Visible's case and T-Mobile's for Mint and Tello. On the bright side that includes 5G coverage through those networks. On the down side your data speeds can be slowed if the parent network is experiencing a lot of traffic.

Cheap unlimited data plans: Which should you pick?

As with any cell phone plan picking the best cheap unlimited data offering from a major wireless carrier comes down to more factors than just price. However if that's your primary concern AT&T is the low-price champ with its Value Plus plan provided you don't need more than one line of data. Families would be better off considering the Welcome Unlimited plan from Verizon particularly if they live in an area where Verizon's coverage is strong.

Perks also play a role in picking a good unlimited plan even if those perks aren't numerous for plans this cheap. Still T-Mobile Essentials includes hotspot data (albeit at slow speeds) and a year of Paramount Plus. It's also the only unlimited plan to promise that your data speeds won't be slowed at least for the first 50GB of data use. Because T-Mobile has the top-ranked 5G network it's also best for 5G coverage even with its cheapest unlimited data plan.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaC5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vaG93LXRvL2lwaG9uZS0xMi1mb3ItZnJlZS1vZmZlcnMtdGhpcy02OTktaXBob25lLWZvci1ub3RoaW5nLWhlcmUtcy1ob3ctNzE2NjIyMjc2ODEyODEuaHRtbNIBf2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaC5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vYW1wL2hvdy10by9pcGhvbmUtMTItZm9yLWZyZWUtb2ZmZXJzLXRoaXMtNjk5LWlwaG9uZS1mb3Itbm90aGluZy1oZXJlLXMtaG93LTcxNjYyMjI3NjgxMjgxLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,iPhone 12 for FREE?

We have officially entered the iPhone 14 week but this has not stopped the constant barrage of rumors. According to the latest price leak  even though the 6.1-inch iPhone 14 Pro and 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Pro Max might be more expensive than their predecessors the increase will be lower than expected and the entry-level 6.1-inch iPhone 14 might actually be more affordable than the iPhone 13.





Still with prices on nearly everything skyrocketing the upgrade will be a tough decision for many and to take the edge off the purchase price Verizon may include the Apple One bundle as a freebie.





Apple One bundles up to six Amazon services (Apple Arcade iCloud+ Apple New+ Apple Fitness+ Apple Music and Apple TV+) into one subscription.





Apple-centric site MacRumors has learned from a carrier source that Verizon may give away Apple One for free with the iPhone 14. It will most likely be included with the carrier's most expensive plan the 5G Get More which costs $90 per month for one person. It's not clear if this service will only be for new customers.





Last month British carrier EE became the first telecom company to include Apple One as a freebie with a plan and it's possible that Verizon will follow in its footsteps by including the individual tier which usually costs $14.95 per month and comes with Apple Arcade iCloud+ with 50GB of storage Apple Music and Apple TV+.





The offer will be a win-win for both parties helping Verizon to woo more consumers and enabling Apple to boost its services business further. Other carriers will of course be coming up with their own iPhone 14 offers

Apple One bundle

Verizon is reportedly gearing up to give customers Apple One as a free perk with eligible plans in September likely coinciding with the launch of the iPhone 14.

Users will likely get the individual plan which usually costs $14.95 per month and includes Apple Arcade Apple Music Apple TV+ and iCloud with 50GB of storage.

VRTX,Vertex Pharmaceuticals,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA5LzA0L3RoZXNlLTMtc3RvY2tzLWFyZS10aGUtZnV0dXJlLW9mLWJpb3RlY2hub2xvZ3kv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These 3 Stocks Are the Future of Biotechnology,"Here's why three Fool.com contributors love Vertex Pharmaceuticals Repligen and Recursion Pharmaceuticals.

The biotech industry is heavily regulated by the federal government and its science watchdog the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As a consequence biotech investors often evaluate a possible investment by looking at the company's pipeline of future assets. Research and development is a key factor in this sector.

So what biotech companies have the most exciting future prospects? Three Fool.com healthcare contributors like Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX -0.31%) Repligen (RGEN 5.60%) and Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX 6.01%). Here's why they believe these three stocks are the future of biotechnology.

An eye-catching deep-value proposition

George Budwell (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): Vertex Pharmaceuticals has become a cash-printing machine recently thanks to its groundbreaking cystic fibrosis treatments like Trikafta. This single drug generated a whopping $5.7 billion in sales in 2021.

The company has been using the proceeds from its mega-blockbuster cystic fibrosis franchise to expand into cutting-edge treatment modalities such as stem cell therapy and gene editing. For example Vertex dipped into its cash reserves in the recent past to buy the privately held biotechs Semma Therapeutics and ViaCyte. These complementary transactions have suddenly made Vertex a potential juggernaut in the world of diabetes care.

The 2019 Semma Therapeutics deal gave the biotech the allogeneic stem-cell product VX-880 aimed at curing type 1 diabetes. And earlier this year Vertex bought ViaCyte for its cell replacement therapy platform which is also initially aimed at curing type 1 diabetes.

This ViaCyte transaction also stands out because the biotech has an ongoing collaboration with Vertex's blood disease collaborator CRISPR Therapeutics. This ViaCyte/CRISPR partnership centers around the development of genetically modified beta cells for the treatment of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. CRISPR and ViaCyte are reportedly on track to release top-line data from an early-stage trial in type 1 diabetes next year. Human trials for the duo's type 2 therapy could kick off in either late 2023 or early 2024.

In sum Vertex's cell- and gene-editing-based diabetes care therapies have the potential to bend the curve in terms of the standard of care for this worldwide epidemic. Wall Street however doesn't appear to have taken notice of this deep value proposition -- at least not yet. Vertex's stock after all seems to be being valued mainly for its cystic fibrosis franchise and pipeline assets in various blood disorders.

The backbone of the future

Patrick Bafuma (Repligen): When it comes to the future Repligen is creating the tools that make it all possible. From cell and gene therapy to cutting-edge mRNA vaccines to monoclonal antibody treatment Repligen is there. This biotech provides the equipment and associated consumables needed for various steps in the manufacturing of today's most complex treatments.

And in a year marred by supply chain and geopolitical issues Repligen has seemingly been insulated. There was hardly a mention of either of these issues in the last few earnings conference calls. Not bad considering its sales are spread throughout the globe with Europe North America and Asia representing 35% 45% and 20% of second-quarter revenue respectively. Despite sales slowing down for COVID-19 treatments and vaccines that Repligen helps manufacture the company's base business in Q2 was up 41% year over year. The record quarterly revenue of $207.6 million -- up 32% year over year on a constant currency basis -- is a welcome sight for biotech investors in 2022's uncertain market.

If you believe cell and gene therapy are the future of healthcare then Repligen deserves a second look. The bioprocessing company's cell and gene therapy segment is seeing accelerated growth. Revenue from this business line increased 40% in full year 2021 and growth in Q2 2022 was up almost 70% from the same period a year ago. This puts Repligen on track to smash its own 40% growth target for the division for 2022. There are other signs the future is bright too. At the end of 2020 there were over 1200 clinical trials underway worldwide in the cell and gene therapy segment according to the company. Then there are the FDA estimates for annual revenue growth of over 25% for the entirety of said market through 2025. Put it all together and Repligen is well positioned to thrive as the backbone of the industry.

Transforming drug discovery

Taylor Carmichael (Recursion Pharmaceuticals): Vertex and Repligen are great picks. Both companies are already highly profitable so the future prospects are grounded in what these companies have already accomplished. Recursion is a different animal. The company doesn't have profits yet and revenue is still small. But I've opened up a small position here because the upside is so high. If this company has any success it will dramatically transform drug discovery.

Here's the current paradigm for finding a new drug candidate. You notice a problem in the world of healthcare. You read academic articles to see what has been tried and what has not been tried. You formulate your own hypothesis. And then you collect data by testing your hypothesis in animals and then in people. That's the basic model for drug discovery -- and it has a spectacular failure rate of over 90%.

Recursion is using supercomputers and artificial intelligence (AI) to create maps of biology. The company's software has already generated 16 petabytes of biological and chemical data. One petabyte equals 1.5 million CD-ROM discs. It's estimated the human brain can store 2.5 petabytes of memory data. So Recursion's AI solution now has more data than six human brains.

Even more importantly the company's AI solution is running experiments with this data all the time. Recursion's computers have now made 2.4 trillion predictions about biological and chemical relationships. Research scientists can search all this data to create a more informed hypothesis. This is a fundamentally superior model in my opinion. First you collect and analyze the scientific data and then you form the hypothesis.

The company has major partners in Bayer and Roche. And Recursion has quickly found drug candidates. In the first quarter the company initiated a phase 2 study for a drug to treat cerebral cavernous malformation. In Q2 the company started a phase 2 study for a molecule to treat neurofibromatosis type 2. This quarter the company will initiate yet another phase 2 study in a drug treating familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).

Of course improving the odds does not mean that these drugs are sure things. But I definitely think Recursion is on the right track and the future of drug discovery will follow this model.

But those halls are still lit and gleaming. And an occasional klink or clunk off in the distance a person briefly appearing from one of the countless rooms off the endless halls is a sign of what is to come as the building’s new owner the WVU Innovation Corp. unfolds its vision.

Lab space lit in yellow-gold.

“What our goal would be is to have a parking problem” said Innovation Corp. president Stacey Armstrong. “It’ll take us some time to get there but that’s our goal.”

Armstrong Assistant Vice President Erica Steratore and Protective Services Manager Rob Snare guided The Dominion Post and members of WVU’s and WVU Medicine’s media relations teams on a tour of Chestnut Ridge Road facility.

Snare worked for Mylan/Viatris for 12 years then spent some time in the banking industry before coming on with the Innovation Corp. So he knows his way through the labyrinth and has guided relative newcomers Armstrong who was hired in May and Steratore who joined in June on tours.

They still haven’t seen the whole place Lewis said.

A warehouse

Steratore is a Ripley native who worked at WVU for a time and came back to Morgantown from UPMC. Lewis worked in the health field in Ohio and also at UPMC before coming here.

We don’t see even a handful of people on the tour. There are 12 people in Facilities six in Protective Services. “It’s a small team but a good team” Armstrong said. They partner with WVU and WVU Medicine for resources. “As we’re grossly successful and fill this all up and all the jobs we create we’ll have a big team.”

The plant was built out in sections over the years with different sections have different numbers of levels and different purposes.

We weave down long halls with countless rooms and labs glowing yellow-gold under their subudued light off to the sides more labs stretching dozens of yards a vast storage room with racks reaching 62 feet high rooms large and small with pill bottle conveyors and 20-foot-high blenders and other equipment Viatris left behind.

Maps are posted on the walls at various spots which can help someone find their way out if they’re alone. But it could take hours.

The office building – the newest part of the plant with the dark mirrored glass tower – is fully furnished. The Innovation Corp. announced last week that Hope Gas is that building’s first tenant and will occupy 35000 of its 55000 square feet.

The office building has collaboration spaces small cafeterias outdoor seating a telepresence room with a bank of big-screen TVs Mylan and Viatris used for remote conversations. Long walls of picture windows offer views across 705 to Ruby and Children’s. “You can really feel this as an extension of the campus” Armstrong said.

The entire facility is 1.2 million square feet. It has 120000 square feet of office space (55000 in the office building more scattered around the plant side) 76000 square feet of lab space 100000 square feet of warehouse and 300000 square feet of manufacturing space.

Their challenge Armstrong and Steratore said is how to divide it up for potential clients. The Innovation Corporation’s vision is catalyze economic growth and improve health across science medicine and technology they said.

“We can have an area that is about energy and we can have an area that’s about health and we can have an area that’s about education” Lewis said.

They often do what they were doing before last week’s tour: pore over floor plans to see how the place is laid out where the natural breaks are if the areas have infrastructure that can support potential tenants ideas for those areas.

Discussions are conducted under non-disclosure agreements they said so they couldn’t be specific about anything. But they’ve talked to interested parties who felt they could take up big parts of the plant. But that posed questions for monopolization of elevators loading docks and such.

The telepresence room

So they’re looking more at using smaller increments for multiple tenants. Because Mylan expanded in sections “it allows us to see sections that could stand alone or work together” Armstrong said.

“Just to do the security is a project in itself” Armstrong said. It won’t be just securing the perimeter but securing between sections for the various tenants and the common spaces the Innovation Corp. will manage.

Snare pointed out that all the security hardware – including a couple hundred CCTC cameras – is still in place. It’s just a matter of turning it back on and segregating the tenants. “It’s a little bit of extra work but it shouldn’t be too hard.”

Armstrong envisions some of the space being devoted to workforce development – to educational space that bridges the gap between high school and four-year degrees. “What’s that development piece that we could do in the middle?”

They are looking for and talking with companies that have a vision for change and forward movement in the fields of energy and health she said perhaps in partnering with the university. They could be in-state companies or out-of-state firms looking to move here.

“We want people outside of the state to realize how great it is in West Virginia” Lewis said. “It’s a broad net.”

Back in 2018 the plant employed 3500 people. Layoffs before the creation of Viatris had the number down to 1500 when Viatris announced the closure at the end of 2020.

We asked what their vision is for building back the workforce. It will take time Armstrong said. How much time they can’t say exactly. Long term they want the same level of activity as before it closed.

“It will be different” she said with different types of businesses occupying the different spaces. “I want the community to feel good that we’re keeping the facility open that we’re going to have good utility for it but it is going to be different than what it was before.”

Russian media published a video of the younger Medvedev wearing a prominently visible Apple Watch accepting his party card from the hand of party official Andrei Turchak the son of a long-time friend of President Vladimir Putin and a former regional governor who has been accused of ordering the near-fatal beating of journalist Oleg Kashin in 2010.

“I will try to use my abilities in the correct way in spheres that are important for the people and the country” Medvedev said promising to undertake projects in sports education health care and “the digital transformation of government.”

It marked something of a coming out for the young Medvedev who previously had kept a low public profile – an initiation into the ranks of Putin’s ruling apparatus. It also came just a couple weeks after unconfirmed reports that the United States had cancelled Ilya Medvedev’s visa and given him two days to leave the country. Although none of the details of the reports was confirmed Dmitry Medvedev wrote an angry Telegram post on June 4 lambasting the West for imposing sanctions on the family members of Russian officials involved in the Ukraine war.

United Russia members who agreed to be interviewed for a profile of Ilya Medvedev by Current Time and Meduza placed little stock in the reports of a U.S. visa but stressed that Dmitry Medvedev who is now deputy chairman of Putin’s Security Council and one of the most avid outspoken proponents of the war on Ukraine needed to demonstrate that both he and his son are “faithful servants of the Motherland.” The party members spoke on condition of anonymity saying they are not authorized to comment to the media.

'A Model Young Man'

In 2016 a party was held at the Royal Bar in Moscow for recent graduates of the international law department of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO). Music for the event was provided by the band Serebro for a fee of 1.5 million rubles (about $25000). The tab was paid by 21-year-old Ilya Medvedev according to two people who attended the event.

It was a typical gesture for the young Medvedev according to several people who knew him during his time at MGIMO a prestigious institute connected to the Foreign Ministry that has a long tradition of educating Soviet and Russian elites. By all accounts Medvedev was a good student who never skipped class or boasted.

“He was a typical representative of the Moscow intelligentsia -- very well-mannered pleasant tactful” said one woman who studied with Medvedev. “He was a model young man. Your mother would be happy if you brought home such a fiancé. He was always friendly and nice.”

“You could talk to him” said another fellow student. “You could joke around. He didn’t get into politics.”

“He didn’t have that swagger that you find with so many of the kids of high-ranking officials” said yet another. These sources also spoke on condition of anonymity citing possible repercussions for public remarks.

Other acquaintances said Medvedev preferred the company of students who earned their way into MGIMO on their academic merit. He sometimes invited his group to his home “where there was a maid and a home theater.” Several sources remembered such gatherings at a home in the wealthy suburban Moscow area known as Rublyovka where both Dmitry Medvedev and Putin live.

The younger Medvedev’s MGIMO acquaintances also recalled that he was always accompanied by two bodyguards in civilian clothes. This was nothing unusual for some students of the prestigious institute. “There was one girl who had five bodyguards” one interlocutor said.

“One girl who dated Ilya complained that her social media had been hacked apparently in an effort to check her out” one of Medvedev’s classmates recalled.

Another recalled accompanying Medvedev to a popular bar in St. Petersburg one weekend.

“When we arrived the bar was completely empty” he said “and all the security cameras had been covered up. [Ilya] also reserved an entire bathhouse in downtown St. Petersburg for us and paid for everything.”

Friends recall that Medvedev loved playing soccer discussing wine and dreamed of a career in the tech industry. In this regard he seems a carbon copy of his father at that time who visited several Silicon Valley firms during a 2010 trip to the United States.

“He talked a lot about start-ups and innovations” one of Ilya Medvedev’s acquaintances recalled.

“Ilya was an example of a normal guy who understood the social situation” another friend said. “When we had discussions [about politics in class] Ilya’s views -- although they were patriotic -- were pretty close to the [relatively liberal] position of his father before he stepped down.”

Dmitry Medvedev was president from 2008 to 2012 steered into the top office by Putin and served as prime minister from 2012 until a government reshuffle that occurred in January 2020 amid preparations for a constitutional change that allows Putin to seek reelection in 2024 and 2030.

His public rhetoric has changed dramatically since then and particularly since Russia launched the large-scale invasion of Ukraine in February. He has railed against Kyiv and the West in Instagram posts that rival some of the most poisonous pro-war anti-Ukrainian propaganda on state television.

'You Shouldn't Cross The Prime Minister's Son'

Another interlocutor recalled that Ilya Medvedev spoke “rather freely” about political topics did not repeat pro-government rhetoric and did not harbor any negative attitudes toward the West.

“If we had more guys like Ilya -- capable young ambitious --and if we had normal transfers of power things [in Russia] would be better” another friend added.

During his time at MGIMO Medvedev was particularly close friends with two fellow students: Ivan Koptenko the son of Ivan Koptenko a member of Russia’s legislature in the early 1990s who has been described in the media as an “oil speculator” and Ilya Trufanov the son of a mid-level businessman. Trufanov was considered the intellectual of the group -- “the most outstanding the wittiest the most erudite” one former student recalled.

During this period Trufanov was dating a fellow student named Yana Grigoryan. People who knew them at the time described their relationship as “very serious.” Somehow however Grigoryan ended up dating Medvedev and the two are still together several years later according to media reports and people who spoke with Current Time and Meduza.

“I think Trufanov accepted this because he understood you shouldn’t cross the prime minister’s son” one former student who knew them both said.

Rublyovka

In a 2016 interview with the tabloid Moskovsky komsomolets Ilya Medvedev stressed that he wanted to make a career on his own.

“I don’t want to work in a major state corporation” he said. “I’m interested in the things that young people are interested in -- like technology.”

Indeed the new graduate’s first job was with the social media company VK also known as VKontakte. According to a 2016 leaked database Medvedev was paid a little over 100000 rubles ($1500) a month while also studying at MGIMO for his master’s degree. He apparently left VK after about a year and in 2019 he took a job with Mail.ru for 226000 rubles ($3500) a month.

Both companies were part of the VK holding which was partially owned by the holding company of Kremlin-connected tycoon Alisher Usmanov.

“Ilya worked there thanks to his father’s name” a Kremlin-connected source said. “They wouldn’t just hire him on his own.”

Another source connected to Mail.ru said Medvedev “did something connected with the legal department. Two other sources who worked at VK until 2021 told Current Time and Meduza that Medvedev worked at the company but they didn’t know his title.

“They talked about him as long as five years ago but I never once saw him at work” one VK senior manager said.

Seven former and current VK employees confirmed they never saw Medvedev at the company. VK declined requests to comment.

Medvedev’s girlfriend Grigoryan worked for a company called Korklass according to a leaked 2019 tax database. Korklass is part of IKS Kholding an IT company owned by Anton Cherepennikov until recently a business partner of Usmanov’s. Korklass provides programming for “safe smart cities” and a controlling share of it is owned by a subsidiary of the state-owned Rostelekom.

Few observers were surprised that Ilya Medvedev and Grigoryan found work in companies tied to Usmanov. In 2017 the Anti-Corruption Foundation of opposition politician Aleksei Navalny released a report based on since-concealed Moscow property records that asserted Usmanov gifted then-President Medvedev a luxurious Rublyovka home worth some $50 million.

Usmanov denied the allegations and successfully sued Navalny in a Moscow court which ordered the opposition group to remove the video and publish a retraction. The Anti-Corruption Foundation stands by its report and has refused to comply with the court’s orders. The video has been viewed more than 45 million times.

A Love Of Wine

In September 2018 media reported on a gala party in Sochi at which Dmitry Medvedev’s wife Svetlana Medvedeva appeared. Observers noticed Ilya Grigoryan and their college friend Ivan Koptenko at the event as well.

Ilya Medvedev and his friends apparently also share a fondness for fine wines. The three of them and Koptenko’s girlfriend Kristina Khtei are all active users of the Vivino wine-evaluating and purchasing app. Although Medvedev does not use his own name on the app the other three all subscribe to two accounts that very likely are his. One is a private account under the name Il Vino 7 that is registered to an “Anton Belov.” A VK account registered under the name “Ilya Belov” is followed by Grigoryan and several former classmates of Medvedev’s. The account is also a fan of Dmitry Medvedev’s official page.

A second Vivino account under the name of Afanasy Medvedev was publicly available until shortly after Current Time and Meduza published this investigation in Russian. In some of the photographs of the wine bottles one can clearly see the reflection of a dark-haired young man wearing an Apple Watch. Grigoryan reviewed many of the same wines on the same day as “Afanasy” (Afanasy was Ilya Medvedev’s paternal great-grandfather’s name). One bottle that Medvedev particularly enjoyed sells for about 4600 euros a bottle.

Ilya Medvedev shares his interest in wine with his father who according to the Navalny report owned a winery in Italy’s Tuscany region. Both Medvedevs have been tied to the Skalisty Bereg wine-producing business in Russia’s Krasnodar region as well. The newspaper Sobesednik reported in 2017 that Dmitry Medvedev owns the winery through a foundation created by a friend from law school named Ilya Yeliseyev.

According to friends who spoke with Current Time and Meduza Khtei works for Skalisty Bereg and graduated from its sommelier training program. A leaked 2019 tax database identifies the company as her employer.

No Comment

No information has been released about Ilya Medvedev’s work as a United Russia member if any since he joined the ruling party in early June. Sources within the party told Current Time and Meduza that he has not been seen at any United Russia events. United Russia Deputy General Secretary Darya Lantratova said it was “too early” to discuss Medvedev’s party projects adding “Ilya Medvedev is still thinking.”

Ilya Medvedev declined to be interviewed or otherwise comment for this story as did Trufanov Grigoryan and Koptenko. Dmitry Medvedev did not respond to written queries submitted to his assistant Oleg Osipov. His former press secretary Natalya Timakova declined to comment.

After the Russian version of this story was published Usmanov’s press service sent a written statement saying that any assertion that “Usmanov ‘is close to the Medvedev family’ is false.” The press service said it was not “able to confirm or deny” the employment of Ilya Medvedev or his girlfriend in any company of Usmanov’s holding adding that Usmanov had no personal involvement in hiring decisions.

Its statement says the following:

“USCIS has begun mailing interview notices to CFRP petitioners with beneficiary interview instructions. On August 18 USCIS began conducting interviews at the U.S. Embassy in Havana. USCIS has limited capacity to conduct interviews at this time so beneficiaries should not take any steps to prepare for an interview until their petitioner receives an interview notice.

“In addition USCIS is sending general information about the resumption of the program to petitioners with pending applications for the CFRP program.”

And it clarifies:

“USCIS is not issuing new letters of invitation at this time. We will update our website and make public announcements when the next round of CFRP program invitation notices is issued. A petitioner who previously submitted a CFRP application that is still pending should not submit another application.

“If you are a petitioner with a pending CFRP application please ensure that both USCIS and the Department of State’s National Visa Center have your current mailing address. To update your address with USCIS please use our online change of address tool. Contact the National Visa Center by submitting an online Public Inquiry Form.

“As USCIS resumes CFRP interviews we will not email or call you asking for money or fee payments. Don’t be a victim of an immigration scam. Visit the Avoid Scams page for information and resources.

“The CFRP program was established in 2007 to provide a safe and orderly pathway to the United States for certain Cuban beneficiaries of approved family-based immigration petitions. The program allows certain eligible U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents who receive a letter of invitation to apply for parole for their family members in Cuba. If USCIS approves these family members for parole they can travel to the United States before their immigrant visa priority dates take effect. CFRP processing was suspended due to the significant reduction in USG staff at the U.S. Embassy in Havana for security reasons in 2017 and the closure of the USCIS field office in Havana in 2018.”

A recruiter claiming to be from the platform had contacted him for a job in Singapore. After receiving an offer letter he was asked to pay various charges including the visa fee and for family relocation. The offer letter however turned out to be fake. The company that made the job offer to him didn't even exist.Similarly a woman with two decades of experience in a major IT services company was approached by a recruiter claiming to be from an executive search firm. He said he had several options for her in leadership roles provided she got her background verification done. She forked out about ₹75000 for this realising only too late that it was a scam. Job frauds  an age-old practice that has become rampant - and more innovative - in recent years aren't sparing anyone: from freshers and professionals in small towns to those who were left jobless by the pandemic to even tech-savvy senior executives are being lured by high salaries and foreign postings. Frauds range from work-from-home job scams  fake job sites and fake call centres/consultancy firms to misrepresentation of reputed job sites/companies. They often access resumes of people looking for jobs from reputed job sites by signing up as genuine recruiters. Companies and job sites that regularly face these issues are now stepping up their vigilance. They are actively cautioning jobseekers launching social media campaigns ramping up compliance processes and using technology to weed out this menace.""Scamsters are becoming smarter ... but we are using technology to stay ahead of them"" said Chandra Sekhar Garisa CEO of Monster India Monster has a multi-pronged strategy to try and minimise this problem: it educates jobseekers offers helpline support for queries stops access to any recruiter found to be suspicious and also provides legal assistance to those who are affected by such scams.Monster's automation engine screens job postings and flags suspicious phrases such as 'WFH from phone' no qualification/prior experience required' 'quick money' 'one-time registration only' etc. A dedicated team looks at suspicious job postings; the compliance team goes through and delists such jobs.""We go through 10000 such job postings every fortnight highlighted by the system. We end up deactivating 400-500 every month"" said Garisa.Frauds reached new highs during Covid and while they have come slightly off those levels they are still widespread. What also works in scamsters' favour is that many people are loath to file complaints because they are ashamed of letting it be known that they were cheated.""It's surprising ... but even people at general manager director levels get duped"" said Sanjay Goyal business head TimesJobs and TechGig. The website educates people to be wary of anyone soliciting money for jobs.""We also use technology to monitor the activity of recruiters on our platform and flag any suspicious searches. We block those people. For similar-sounding fake websites we make a complaint to the cyber cell and shut them down"" said Goyal.Cos step up:Job frauds have increased given the rise in recruitment activity in the last one year said Tata Steel  which is making continuous efforts to raise awareness.""Our external touchpoints including the corporate website and social media platforms carry necessary declarations to inform our audience. We also have a dedicated command centre and brand-protection team who examine such cases and take necessary actions against fraudsters including legal recourse. Our online reputation management team actively responds to user queries in this regard"" said a spokesperson.On Thursday Carlsberg India issued a notification about fake recruitment warning people against scamsters who have been using the brewer's name brand and logo and calling candidates for interviews with the precondition of making a ""security deposit"".

Sept. 1 2022

The Minister of Sustainable Development Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management Hon. Orlando Habet said during an interview this week that he has visited the Gales Point community and confirmed that the residents are opposed to Vulcan Material Company’s proposal to establish a mining operation to extract limestone from the Sugar Hills located on the White Ridge Farm near the village. Minister Habet said that those hills serve a number of critical functions and are a landmark that can be seen by those traveling from the direction of Belize City to Gales Point by boat.

He remarked “I know that the people are really strongly against it not only because of the material that could possibly end up in the sea and affect the alkalinity of the ocean change the entire biodiversity of the area. We are also concerned that if those hills are broken down that is the only landmark from Belize City by boat over to Gales Point but also on the other side of biodiversity there are a lot of animal species that will be affected so really the Ministry does not look at it favorably either.”

This is yet another declaration of non-support by a Cabinet member in regard to Vulcan Material Company’s proposal to set up its mining operation in Belize. It must be noted that as previously reported the company’s mining operation in Mexico was shut down by the Mexican government due to severe and irreparable environmental damage caused in the area.

While at this point the government appears to have sided with members of the Gales Point community who are vehemently opposed to the project the multi-billion-dollar US-based company continues its efforts to carry out public information campaigns and meet with government officials. It is also seeking to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment.

“Anybody can apply but whether or not it will be approved is something else. But hopefully the government will have to decide if not now — rather sooner than later — on what kind of development it really wants going forward” Minister Habet said.

Notably Minister of Natural Resources Petroleum and Mining and Deputy Prime Minister Hon. Cordel Hyde has rejected the company’s advances. Additionally the Prime Minister Hon. John Briceño in a recent interview said that he does not think Cabinet will approve the company’s proposal and the Gales Point community’s area representative Minister of Human Development Hon. Dolores Balderamos Garcia has gone on the record to indicate her support of the members of her constituency who are rejecting the company’s proposals.",,,,,,,,,,,,

If you're old enough to remember when broadcast television was still king you might remember something called a ""very special episode"" an episode of a sitcom that dealt with hard hitting issues (often drugs). Lots of shows had them. ""Home Improvement"" had the episode ""The Longest Day"" where the family finds out that Randy might have cancer. In ""Boy Meets World"" Shawn was suckered into joining a cult in ""Cult Fiction."" Oh and who could forget ""Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue"" the Saturday morning cartoon special featuring every cartoon character you can think of teaming up to stop one kid from doing drugs?

According to No Film School the ""very special episode"" format which began in the 1970s seems to have originated from writers — particularly those working on lighthearted programs — wanted to delve deeper than their usual fare. And in the book ""Very Special Episodes: Televising Industrial and Social Change"" editors Jonathan Cohn and Jennifer Porst open their introduction by talking about what they call the most recognizable very special episode ever made: the ""Saved by the Bell"" episode ""Jessie's Song.""

The 9th episode of Season 2 which aired in 1990 remains the most famous and infamous episode of the series and has been the subject of a lot of much teasing over the years including the 2020 ""Saved By the Bell"" reboot which made several jokes about the episode.

Bed Bath & Beyond stock has assumed meme status due to frenzied interest among retail traders. The brick-and-mortar retailer has suffered along with other retail names amid the COVID pandemic. Following the deterioration in fundamentals the company recently announced restructuring initiatives including job cuts and store closures while also raising additional financing through an equity offering.

The retailer’s stock began to trace a downtrend in April and bottomed at sub-$5 levels in July. A meme rally took hold in August sending the stock as high as $30 in mid-August. News concerning the sale of the entire 10% stake built up by activist investor Ryan Cohen sent the stock hurtling lower thereafter.

Bed Bath & Beyond closed Friday’s session down 0.92% at $8.63 according to Benzinga Pro data.

Gustavo Arnal was hired by Bed Bath & Beyond in May 2020 and credited with helping get the New Jersey-based retail giant through the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic the company said in a statement Sunday.

The exec came aboard as chief financial officer and executive vice president after “a distinguished global career in finance” that included working at “several other well-known businesses” the company stated Sunday.

Arnal came from cosmetic company Avon where he was also named the executive vice president and CFO starting in spring 2019 according to the Cincinnati Business Courier. He was at Walgreens Boots Alliance before that serving as senior vice president and CFO of international divisions and global functions the Business Courier said.

Both of those gigs were based in London.

But most of his career was at Procter & Gamble where he spent 20 years holding various positions and working with brand names including Pringles potato chips and Tide detergent.

The husband and father of two adult daughters was CFO of the company’s India Middle East and Africa business where he oversaw operations in more than 50 countries the Cleveland Business Journal reported in May 2020.

When Arnal was announced as Bed Bath & Beyond’s newest hire he said the company had to build “on the strong foundations of this business with a new robust and sustainable business model” the Cleveland Business Journal reported.

He also reportedly said he looked forward to working as a “catalyst for the cultural and financial change in the business.”

But the housewares company has struggled mightily recently and is expected to close 150 stores and terminate 20% of its workforce after an announcement about its restructuring came days before his death.

Arnal was also included in a recent lawsuit that accuses him Chewy.com founder Ryan Cohen and others of artificially inflating the retail’s share price.

The class action was filed Aug. 23 in Washington DC.

AUSTIN Texas — According to a report from The Dallas Morning News Walmart is stepping down in its legal fight against a liquor store law in Texas.

Last summer the retailer filed a lawsuit in Austin challenging a portion of the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Code stopping publicly traded retailers from owning liquor stores.

This reportedly marked the second time Walmart has met Texas in court. The company had originally sued in 2015 a battle it initially won three years later. However the ruling was reversed in 2019.

The Dallas Morning News reported that Walmart isn't giving up on its efforts in Texas just yet potentially looking into options to build spaces in its stores with separate entrances for liquor sales.

Currently Walmart is allowed to sell liquor in more than two dozen states.

The Bentonville-based retailer said Wednesday that it had reached an agreement with Sustainable Beef LLC in North Platte Neb. to buy an unspecified stake in the firm for an undisclosed sum.

A Walmart spokeswoman said the deal which has already closed also gives Walmart representation on Sustainable Beef's board of directors.

David Briggs Sustainable Beef's chief executive told the North Platte Telegraph that local investors and founding ranchers own the bulk of the company.

The new plant will create more than 800 direct jobs the companies said in a joint news release. They expect to break ground this month and open by late 2024.

The Walmart spokeswoman said the beef that Walmart buys from the new plant will go to stores in the central U.S. She did not say how much beef Walmart will source from the facility.

""There will be no change in our current suppliers"" she said. ""We value our supplier partners and look forward to working with them to continue to provide high-quality affordable beef to our customers.

""This effort increases needed capacity for the beef industry and creates steady demand for cattle ranchers and jobs for those across the supply chain"" the spokeswoman said.

""This partnership helps supplement the current beef industry and provides an additional way for ranchers and family farms to grow their businesses"" she said.

No Arkansas ranchers are involved in the venture she said.

Kelly Vierck assistant professor of meat science and muscle biology in the University of Arkansas' Department of Animal Science said sustainable beef is produced throughout the U.S. ""by cattle ranchers and producers working to ... maintain and improve the natural resources used by the industry through regenerative grazing management responsible grain sourcing continuing economic viability for ranchers and reducing its use of non-renewable resources.""

The extra processing capacity will be welcome Vierck said especially since the pandemic revealed supply chain issues in the meat and food industries.

""A new plant with capacity for 1500 head will help increase harvest capacity for the industry overall especially with the unique model of being a rancher-owned company"" Vierck said.

And in areas like North Platte she said local processors are few and shipping cattle for processing is expensive. A plant in this area would give small ranching outfits more consistent availability for processing which in turn helps produce a more consistent high-quality product Vierck said.

""This also increases market competition for cattle in these areas so there may be improvements in profits for producers as well"" she said.

Tyler Lehr senior vice president of merchandising for deli services meat and seafood at Walmart U.S. said Sustainable Beef LLC ""has a responsible approach to beef processing one that includes creating long-term growth for cattle ranchers and family farmers.""

""This investment provides greater visibility into the beef supply chain and complements Walmart's regeneration commitment to improve grazing management"" Lehr said.

The investment is also part of a commitment the retailer made in 2019 to create its own end-to-end supply chain bringing Black Angus beef from pasture to store.

Walmart said in April that year that it was starting the venture by sourcing from best-in-class suppliers to put its all-natural no-hormone-added beef in 500 stores in the Southeast.

The company said at the time that it was responding to customer demand for visibility in every step of the supply chain.

In 2020 Walmart opened a case-ready facility in Thomasville Ga. where the beef was prepared for shipment to stores mainly in Georgia Alabama and Florida.

But Walmart is looking beyond the U.S. to find customers for sustainable beef.

Walmart Canada recently said it is buying 1 million pounds of beef from certified sustainable Canadian farms and ranches.

That's in addition to its October 2021 commitment to buy 1.5 million pounds of sustainable beef.

""As we continue on our journey to becoming a regenerative company we're always looking for opportunities to provide our customers with options that are better for the planet"" said Rob Pereira Walmart Canada's senior director of meat and seafood.

A worker at an airport who stole a twin-engine plane Saturday morning and threatened to crash it into a Mississippi Walmart was arrested after he eventually landed in a field police said.

In a news conference Saturday Tupelo Police Chief John Quaka identified the arrested pilot as Cory Wayne Patterson an employee with Tupelo Aviation for the past 10 years.

Quaka said that at 5:08 a.m. local time Patterson of Shannon Mississippi stole a Beechcraft King Air C90 twin engine aircraft and took off from Tupelo Regional Airport.

“We do know Patterson has some flight instruction” Quaka said. “We do not believe he is a licensed pilot. That is still ongoing to discover that.”

As a lineman Quaka said Patterson is responsible for fueling aircraft. The chief said the plane was fully fueled the night before.

Around 5:23 a.m. Patterson called Lee County 911 from the aircraft and said he was going to crash the plane into the West Main Walmart in Tupelo Quaka said. Soon thereafter the store and surrounding areas were evacuated. Numerous major streets in Tupelo were shut down as well according to the chief.

The Tupelo Walmart store was “closed and evacuated” Charles Crowson director of the Walmart Press Office told CNN earlier while the plane was airborne.

Quaka said negotiators from Tupelo Police contacted the pilot and convinced him to land the plane at Tupelo airport. A private pilot assisted police in helping Patterson but upon final approach the pilot aborted the landing and traveled northwest Quaka said. Several counties were notified of what was going on Quaka said.

More than four hours later Patterson made a Facebook post. “In essence it said goodbye. At this point we knew he was getting close to running out of fuel” Quaka said.

After police lost and then re-established radar contact with the plane Patterson confirmed he had landed in a field according to the chief.

Soon thereafter Patterson was taken into custody and charged with grand larceny and making terroristic threats the chief said. He was booked into the Lee County Detention Center Saturday afternoon jail records show. It was unclear whether Patterson has an attorney.

Quaka said he anticipated the federal government will proceed with federal charges.

The FAA says it is investigating the incident. The FBI field office in Jackson Mississippi also was involved in the incident response a spokesperson said.

Roxanne Ward 42 told CNN the plane landed behind the Gravestown Fire Department near her home about 10:20 a.m.

“He landed pretty hard” she said.

Video she shared with CNN shows the small plane largely intact in a field with law enforcement surrounding the pilot.

Ward heard the plane coming and ran over to her father-in-law’s house to hide in the basement she said. “That’s when we heard the thud.”

In response to a reporter’s question Quaka said he has been in contact with the pilot’s family who is “very concerned” about Patterson’s well-being.

“Thankful the situation has been resolved and that no one was injured” Gov. Tate Reeves said in a tweet. “Thank you most of all to local state and federal law enforcement who managed this situation with extreme professionalism.”"
DIS,Walt Disney,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaW5lbWFibGVuZC5jb20vdGhlbWUtcGFya3MvaW0tYS1kYWQtd2hvLWp1c3Qtd2VudC10by1kaXNuZXktd29ybGQtd2l0aC1teS1mYW1pbHktZm9yLXRoZS1maXJzdC10aW1lLWhlcmVzLXdoYXQtaWQtY2hhbmdlLWlmLXdlLXdlbnQtYWdhaW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I'm A Dad Who Just Went To Disney World With My Family For The First Time. Here's What I'd Change If We Went Again,"Disney World is known as the “Most Magical Place on Earth” and I learned that firsthand with my family during a recent three-day trip and resort stay. We made many memories that will stay with me forever and overall I enjoyed my time in the park. With that said as a dad who just took his family to Disney World for the first time there are definitely some things I’d do differently should we return in the future.

Before getting into all this I do want to reiterate I did have a great time at Disney World. However I was very new to the Disney vacation experience and I’m sure I’m not the only person who will attend in the new future that is. For anyone planning or hoping to plan a trip and thinking debating the value of Genie+ is their main concern I’ll be the first to say there are a few more things to prepare for on such a vacation.

I’d Spend More To Avoid The Value Resorts Or Stay Off Property

One of the things I heard going into booking this trip was that staying on the property was convenient compared to staying off. After staying at the All-Star Movies resort we definitely questioned if the “convenience” of staying on property was worth the trade-off for what we could’ve gotten spending the same money off the property.

Our food options were limited to expensive cafeteria food I’d label as “fine.” It wasn’t bad but it's way more than I would’ve paid eating off the property. I also wasn’t thrilled with the fact we often had to walk way further than the other resorts to get to our bus stops and seemingly experienced less frequent pickups compared to some of the higher-priced resorts. To be fair I only felt like that was the case and wasn’t keeping a watch but I definitely had plenty of time at stops watching other buses come and go.

These things paired with some other minor issues with our accommodations (I didn’t get the memo the Magic Express was phased out  for one) gave me one major takeaway. Disney World does offer options for people to stay on the property on a value budget but you’re better served spending even more money for a nicer experience or by staying elsewhere. If I’m in a better position to go beyond the value tier next time I will or I’ll just skip out on the resort experience entirely and sacrifice bus service and the extra minutes in the park.

I Would Avoid Florida In August

I’m from the Midwest and while we’re not exactly foreign to the concept of hot summers and humid weather there’s really no easing into Florida in the height of August. The humidity is thick making it uncomfortable to spend hours on the concrete with the temperature in the low to mid-90s for a vast majority of the day. Make no mistake battling the heat is a real thing at Disney World and I saw a few people and even felt myself losing the battle at times.

The only reprieve from the heat is rain and given that August is in the midst of Florida’s hurricane season rain is a safe bet. Unfortunately it’s also hard to predict so if you do go a poncho is certainly worth the investment. These are obviously tips any Disney veteran would know but for someone who has only been to Florida sporadically throughout my lifetime it's something I learned the hard way.

I’d Buy Those Gimmicky Fans And Other Things To Keep Cool

When my sister first suggested a cooling towel to help deal with the heat at Disney World I scoffed at the idea. Fast forward to the trip I was soaking that thing every hour in a water fountain or bathroom just trying to find some reprieve from the heat. It made a noticeable difference and suddenly my mind began to race about all the other gimmicky devices I could utilize that would’ve helped me beat the heat during my stay.

Personally I was very interested in that combo spray bottle and fan I saw at a couple of booths but the fans that looked like headphones you wear around your neck were also interesting. I didn’t try either unfortunately because I was already spending so much on everything else and it felt like anything available on-site was at a markup I just couldn’t justify. With that said if I would’ve traveled back in time to myself a week before the trip I definitely would’ve told myself to order some of those things on Amazon to take to the park with me.

I’d Pack More Food To Bring Into The Park

You can get a lot of great food and drinks at Disney World if you know where to look and frequent but therein lies the problem. If you haven’t done your due diligence and are just roaming the park for something to eat because you’re starving from all the walking you might bypass all those appetizing options for a food item that isn’t any more ambitious or delicious than something found at the county fair.

Fair food is good but there’s also a time and a place for it. If I had some granola bars I might’ve opted for those rather than trying to choke down Woody’s Lunch Box Totchos at 9:30 a.m. for breakfast. In short it’s good to have some snacks on hand especially if you’re someone who won’t specifically be scouting out food stalls for menu items during your stay.

I’d Do Two Days At Magic Kingdom And Miss One Of The Other Parks

Epcot’s ongoing construction and the recent closing of the Frozen ride kept my family from that side of Disney World during my stay but I spent plenty of time in Magic Kingdom Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom. After spending a day in each park with my wife and four-year-old daughter I can earnestly say I would’ve skipped out on one of those parks for another day at Magic Kingdom.

Speaking as someone with a bias in that I went with a Disney princess-obsessed child there was plenty to do at Magic Kingdom and not so much in comparison at the other parks. Magic Kingdom boasts an impressive 23 rides most of which are rooted in Disney’s most classic movies. It’s also home to the Cinderella Castle the Dapper Dans Main Street USA and a place where a bunch of hillbilly bears have sung country tunes since the park’s opening .

Hollywood Studios has the new hotness and can’t-miss-rides and experiences but with only nine of them you’ll run out of things fast ( especially if Olaf gets knocked over ). Epcot as mentioned is a work in progress at the moment and Animal Kingdom is more about seeing the animals than anything ( sometimes closer than you’d expect particularly if snakes are involved ). If you’re someone who doesn’t frequent Disney often and think you have to see all of the parks when you’re here I get it. With that said I ended my time at Disney wishing I did more at Magic Kingdom and felt I did about all I could everywhere else. Overall I have few regrets and enjoyed most everything but would certainly do things differently if I return in the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pY2VjaGF0LmNvbS8zMzE2MjUtZGlzbmV5bGFuZC13aW5uaWUtdGhlLXBvb2gtbGF3c3VpdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Koenig: The Day the Pooh Hit the Stand,"Of all the cast member misadventures I’ve shared over the years in books like Mouse Tales: A Behind-the-Ears Look at Disneyland the most eye-opening stories frequently involve untoward behavior by the characters. There was the crazed visitor who pulled a knife on Alice in Wonderland and demanded a date the tourist who groped Minnie Mouse and the guest who claimed she was the one who was fondled—by one of the Three Little Pigs.

But one I initially didn’t tell the complete story of was the day Winnie the Pooh got hauled into court for walloping a nine-year-old. According to newspaper reports and court records the Silly Old Bear was framed. It was all an accident. Well not exactly… as I discovered a few months after Mouse Tales was first published.

I got my first hint that there was more to the story in October 1994 during a short-lived event called the Disneyana Showcase put on by Storyboard magazine (short-lived because Storyboard’s publisher passed away not long after). As I signed copies of Mouse Tales and other vendors peddled postcards and pins the show’s mascot—an energetic beaver named Wally—cavorted with the dozens of showgoers walking the aisles. At one point Wally came over to my table to get my attention. He didn’t speak but clearly he wanted to make an impression.

Near the end of the day a middle-aged fellow of modest build and height stopped by to say he was a “friend” of Wally’s. (It took me a minute to realize “friend” of was Disney Code for him actually being Wally.) When he introduced himself as Robert Hill I knew exactly who he was—the actor who played Pooh on that fateful day in court. I asked him if he was happy with my retelling of his incident. “Yes but there’s more” Hill said cryptically. “The kid had it coming.” And with that he wandered off.

We’d run into each other a few more times and I formally interviewed him twice—the first time in 1998 at his apartment for More Mouse Tales. Robert who joined Disneyland’s Character Department in 1969 was unlike all of the other characters I’d spoken with over the years. He wasn’t cuddly. During his Disney days he preferred playing the sullen donkey Eeyore trudging about alone true to character. He’d get upset when other actors would play Eeyore upbeat “to get cheap laughs.” The costume’s large paws made it difficult to sign autographs so Hill usually refused—resulting in several written reprimands. When he did sign to be authentic he wrote “EOR” as Eeyore did in the A.A. Milne books—baffling most of the guests.

Robert had no touching stories about life-altering encounters with precocious children. Frankly he talked as if the guests were the enemy. He spoke at length about the many injuries he and his costumed colleagues had suffered at the hands—and feet—of mean-spirited guests. He said the characters developed their own tactics for anticipating and avoiding an attack moving to soften any blows and even subtly fighting back. Hill became a master of furry-self defense. He never wanted to hurt a guest but was willing to do whatever it took to make sure they didn’t hurt him.

One summer day in 1974 Hill was dressed as Winnie the Pooh greeting guests between the Plaza Inn and First Aid (where today the corndog cart sits). On top of Pooh’s head was a large fiberglass honeypot that covered the actor’s head and had subtle patches of black screening in the front and back for the actor to look through. A tall nine-year-old girl approached from the rear and socked him in the back.

“Boom! You might as well be in an oil drum” Hill recalled. He turned his head inside the honeypot to look out the back while the girl thought he was still looking straight ahead. “I saw her winding up for a second run on me so as she closed in for the kill I spun around to scare her but she was already on top of me. I spun around and Pooh’s ear caught her in the side of her head. The ear was a fur-covered fiberglass shell. Her father said ‘Why did you hit my daughter for no reason?’ Hit her? In this thing? My arms were hanging like something on a seal. I was harmless. But I could tell we had to get out of there.”

The Pooh troupe hurried off stage and Robert went to tell his lead what happened. He recalled “The next thing you know the family is a City Hall where the situation multiplied. They registered an official complaint: you ‘beat and battered my child.’ My supervisor came and asked for my story. He saw no issue with it. At the time the leads knew the limitations of the costumes because they had all come up through the ranks themselves.”

The girl’s family filed suit demanding $15000. Both parties agreed to go to non-binding arbitration where she was awarded $1000. Disney said it wouldn’t pay more than $500. The family said they’d already spent about $160 on medication that the girl suffered deep bruises persistent headaches and possibly future brain damage so they wouldn’t go below $1000. The lawyer thought he was calling Disney’s bluff. After all did Disney want to risk the media attention of Winnie the Pooh slapping a little kid?

The case finally made it to trial six years later. Disney’s lawyer asked Hill to testify holding the Pooh costume so he could point out its limitations. Disney had a strict policy to never publicly display a “broken-down” costume. If he was going to demonstrate the costume he was going to be inside it.

So Robert first took the stand as himself to tell his side of the story—that he didn’t slap her; he accidentally bumped her with a furry ear after being pushed from behind. Two things furry characters are never allowed to do are talk and retaliate. Then after a brief recess Hill reentered the courtroom—as Pooh. He demonstrated what he did at the park by skipping dancing and nuzzling the court reporter.

“The plaintiff’s attorney when he saw me come out with the costume I swear he did a facepalm. ‘We’re screwed’” Robert remembered. “I skip out the whole bit you hear all the people: ‘Ooooooh.’ Even the non-smiling bailiff was smiling. Meanwhile I’m looking back at the jury room and it’s filling up with spectators. ‘You’re not gonna believe it—Winnie the Pooh’s on trial!’ It was standing room only in the back.”

Finally Hill was asked how high he could lift his paws. Since the arms were inoperable stubs he couldn’t get them more than three feet off the ground—and the girl got hit in the head five feet high.

It took the jury just 21 minutes to find Disney innocent. After the ruling the bailiffs and other court reporters asked Hill to put the costume back on to pose for pictures with them.

Twenty years later after another meet-up with Robert I was able to tell his full story when I revisited the case for The People v. Disneyland: How Lawsuits & Lawyers Transformed the Magic.

Speaking of which if you’ve got some spare space on your bookshelf you can complete your David Koenig Collection by visiting me this weekend at the MiceChat booth at D23. I’ll be signing all of my books including the coffee-table beauty The 55ers: The Pioneers Who Settled Disneyland. I’ll even bring along my latest page-turner—Shooting Columbo—a blow-by-blow account of the making of Peter Falk’s classic TV detective series.

In addition I’ll have signed copies of the memoirs of two Disneyland treasures from Opening Day: long-timer Bob Penfield and the park’s first tour guide Bob D’Arcy. The Bobs have autographed copies of respectively The Last Original Disneylander and A Walk in the Park specifically for D23 attendees. They signed about two dozen of each so grab ‘em while I’ve got ‘em!

According to a lawsuit filed earlier this year Jessica Straub fell while at Disney’s Caribbean Beach Resort at the Disney Resort in Orlando Central Florida. The documentation shared that Straub died from blunt force trauma to the head with lawyers tying her death to the fall she took on Disney property just days earlier. The filing also shows that Straub died on December 22 2020 while the incident at Caribbean Beach happened on December 18 2020.

It is this time gap and the frequent missing details in the plaintiff’s documentation and complaint that are causing Disney Parks and Resorts to lambast the claim.

Disney has responded to the complaint made on behalf of Straub’s estate anchoring their argument in the alleged missing details from the incident including how her death can be traced back to her fall at Disney’s Caribbean Beach Resort. The Mouse House filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit that was filed in June 2022 at the Orange County Circuit Court according to Florida Politics. The source also states that Judge Vincent Chiu has not responded to Disney’s dismissal request.

Florida Politics reports on The Walt Disney Company’s comments on the ongoing Jessica Straub lawsuit:

“Even after a thorough consideration of all six pages of the Complaint the reader is left wondering what allegedly happened to Ms. Straub and how it was supposedly Walt Disney Parks and Resorts’ fault” Disney said in court documents filed July 19.

Disney goes on to call the lawsuit “vague” and “scattershot” saying the complaint is “little more than a collection of legal conclusions and jurisdictional allegations.”

Florida Politics continues to outline the House of Mouse’s stance on the events that unfolded following Straub’s fall on her Disney vacation:

“Noticeably absent are: any description or allegation explaining what or whom allegedly inflicted the ‘bodily injury’ on Ms. Straub; what the specific nature of the ‘bodily injury’ was; where in the roughly 200 acres that comprise Walt Disney Parks and Resorts’ Caribbean Beach Resort the injury allegedly occurred; or when in the four-day time-period referenced in the Complaint Ms. Straub’s injury occurred” Disney said in the motion. “The lack of such details makes it … impossible for (Disney) to decipher how Plaintiff claims it is liable and mandates the dismissal of the Complaint.”

Filed by Straub’s cousin (according to her obituary) Justin Morrison the lawsuit is handled by Morgan & Morgan who declined to comment on Disney’s response to the ongoing litigation.

There are a number of open lawsuits directed at The Walt Disney Company at least through the lens of the Orange County Circuit Court. One Guest is suing the company after suffering an injury while staying at Disney’s Old Key West Resort and another lawsuit discloses a fall that happened at the Walt Disney World Dolphin.

As for the case of Jessica Straub the lawsuit points the finger at the Walt Disney World Resort claiming negligent Disney Park Cast Members and unsafe conditions. The court case continues.

It's one of the tragic moments of adulthood. You sit down to watch a film you idolized in your childhood — and haven't seen in just as long — only to discover a far less magical or even entertaining experience. Luckily that's absolutely not the case with the 1995 Disney classic ""A Goofy Movie"" which I recently treated myself to a rewatch of. I am happy to report that the movie is still as heartwarming and hilarious as I remember it. From the big laughs of the Bigfoot scene to the teary eyes I still get when Max and Goofy finally reconcile.

But from the very beginning Disney had less than stellar expectations for ""A Goofy Movie"" compared to bigger features like ""The Lion King"" or ""Pocahontas."" In fact it wasn't even developed by Walt Disney Animation Studios (then called Walt Disney Feature Animation) but rather by a subdivision called Disneytoon Studios that had only two films under its belt so far: ""DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp"" and ""The Return of Jafar.""

Yet despite the dismal critical response and fraction of money it earned at the box office there still exists a ton of fervor over ""A Goofy Movie"" that's only grown in the last decade. After all people don't spend time rewatching a film they saw in their childhood sharing it with their friends partner or kids because of how well-reviewed it was or how much money it made.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL2Rpc25leS12YWNhdGlvbi1lc3NlbnRpYWxzLXRyYXZlbC1taXN0YWtlcy0xODAwMjAyNDcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Heading to Disney World? 10 essential items you need for your trip,"Yahoo Lifestyle Canada is committed to finding you the best products at the best prices.

1. Resealable plastic bags

A plastic bag might seem like an inconsequential item to bring along with you but believe me they will certainly come in handy. Resealable bags like the popular Ziploc brand have so many uses you'll thank me later for the recommendation.

For one thing they're ideal for stashing clothes or shoes in the event that they get wet — either from one of the park's water rides or the unpredictable Florida weather. For another Disney food portions are huge so unless you're planning to stuff yourself at every meal there'a a good chance you'll end up with some leftover food along the way.

Keep a few bags at hand for snacks clothing or even preventing spills in your backpack and your trip will run much smoother for it.

2. Extra shoes and socks

Let me paint a picture for you: it's 8 p.m. in Disney World and you're frantically trying to locate a store that sells flip-flops because someone in your group has a painful case of blisters from their shoes. I've been in that exact situation and I can tell you it's not a fun one.

There's nothing worse than uncomfortable shoes during a day on your feet (especially when you're walking 15000 to 20000 steps a day) so here's a bit of friendly advice: pack an extra pair of shoes and socks in your park bag. If they end up getting wet you'll be grateful to have something to change into. Even if they don't get wet switching shoes toward the end of a long day can give your feet the second wind they need to power through those last few rides.

3. A poncho

On my last Disney World vacation I thought I had things covered by bringing a rain jacket with me — boy was I wrong. It worked out okay for periods of light drizzle but when dealing with bouts of torrential rain my little jacket didn't hold up. Instead I'd recommend bringing a packable rain poncho for extra protection.

While you can purchase ponchos in the parks they're much more expensive than other options that you can buy ahead of time for a fraction of the price.

4. Power banks and charging cables

For better or for worse using your phone has become an essential part of any trip to Walt Disney World. From mobile ordering food to scoping out the next available Genie+ ride time expect to use your phone a lot throughout the day.

To make sure that you don't run of battery be sure to pack a portable power bank and charging cables for any of the devices that may need a top-up — cell phones watches and even electric fans.

5. A cooling towel

In a way I did have this on hand for my last Disney vacation but only thanks to the help of some friends who planned ahead. When my neck fan died during the middle of the day a cooling towel was an absolute life-saver for making it through the heat. Now I know to always bring one with me just in case.

Simply wet them periodically and leave them draped around the back of your neck for instant relief from the heat.

In terms of items I never leave home without these items have been essential on all of my Disney trips in the past.

6. A reusable water bottle

Don't get caught in the trap of thinking you need to purchase bottled water for your whole trip. All quick-service and sit down restaurants offer free cups of water with your food and there are several water-refill stations scattered throughout the parks to help you stay hydrated.

7. A personal fan

If you're looking for a way to beat the heat a personal fan is my favourite way to stay cool. Whether you choose a handheld version or one to wear around your neck they both do the trick.

8. SPF

Speaking from experience the Florida sun can get intense. Just a few minutes of direct sunlight can lead to a sunburn so I'm always sure to pack plenty of sunscreen to reapply throughout the day.

9. A backpack

The easiest most convenient way to keep all your essentials in one place and stay hands-free is with a backpack. Just know that you'll need to spend a few extra minutes at security before entering the parks when you bring one with you.

10. Snacks

No Disney World trip would be complete without at least a few Mickey-shaped treats but sometimes your stomach and your wallet could use a break. Luckily you can pack your own food to take into the parks as long as it doesn't need to be reheated and isn't packaged in glass containers.

Won't Save Batgirl Like Zack Snyder's Justice League,"Warner Bros. has made plenty of controversial decisions regarding its DC projects over the years with the abandonment of Zack Snyder's cut of Justice League in favor of Joss Whedon's placing high on the list. The divisive move led to a several-year campaign to #ReleaseTheSnyderCut that eventually proved successful and most believed could never be matched.

That was until recently when the new Warner Bros. Discovery management regime made the decision to cancel the HBO Max original Batgirl movie. Several reasons have already been given regarding the decision including the quality of the flick the focus on theatrical events over streaming movies and the plan to take a tax write-down to save money.

Just as has happened with many canceled projects a #SaveBatgirl campaign emerged on social media to rescue the DC flick. This may have worked in the past with cases such as Zack Snyder's Justice League and Brooklyn Nine-Nine being among the most famous but any rescue doesn't appear to be in the cards for Batgirl.

Why HBO Max's Batgirl Can't Be Saved

The Direct

The Hollywood Reporter explained in a recent article why Batgirl won't eventually be released similarly to Zack Snyder's Justice League despite receiving a similar outcry from fans.

Part of the reasoning behind the cancellation of Batgirl came from Warner Bros.'s ability to take a tax write-down by abandoning the flick something that was not done in cutting hours of Zack Snyder's Justice League footage. By making this move to save money on tax and enhance profits the studio becomes legally prohibited from releasing Batgirl in any way that generates revenue.

Directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah have also noted they have no access to the footage that was filmed for Batgirl in contrast to Snyder who departed Justice League with his rough cut saved to a laptop allowing him to later complete the blockbuster.

Typically when a studio accepts a tax write-down on a project that will lose revenue the saving will be granted over several years in order to demonstrate how much money is lost off the project over time. Several of THR's sources have claimed Warner Bros. may attempt to prove to the IRS that Batgirl will never generate any revenue by destroying all footage.

However other sources disputed the claim by pointing out Warner Bros. still has footage saved for scrapped projects such as HBO's Bloodmoon the unaired pilot for the first attempt at a Game of Thrones spin-off. If the footage was saved Warner Bros. could theoretically release Batgirl down the line and repay the tax write-down to the government.

No Resurrections This Time

The Direct

The viral campaign to release Zack Snyder's Justice League may have proven successful in the long run but the situation surrounding Batgirl is clearly different. In taking a tax write-down Warner Bros. will be legally committing to abandoning the flick with certain reports suggesting they may go as far as to delete the existing footage off the face of the Earth.

Not to mention the calls to save Batgirl are clearly nowhere near as strong as the Snyder Cut movement which remained dedicated to the cause for several years. Fans may currently be outraged with the decision but the Batman spin-off likely wouldn't have seen any insane success especially if it was limited to an HBO Max release.

Batgirl was also far further from completion than many originally believed as the directors have since revealed the DC flick still had most of its VFX work to be done and reshoots were to take place. By contrast Zack Snyder's Justice League was nearing completion and didn't require a huge amount of work to finish after the project was resurrected.

Ever since the change of Warner Bros. regime the studio appears to be falling short on cash to continue operating at full capacity. Reports have already revealed Warner Bros. only has the cash to release two movies across the rest of this year - Black Adam and Don't Worry Darling - so the tax write-down on Batgirl and other projects was probably a means to lessen the cash-flow problem.

Even though the movement to release Zack Snyder's Justice League may have been successful it's important to remember the rarity of a case such as that succeeding. At the end of the day Warner Bros. for better or for worse is the one to make the calls on the direction of its brands in order to push them in the way it sees fit.

Casella Waste Systems Inc. the largest waste management company in the state will not complete its purchase of the Grow Compost facility in Moretown because of permitting challenges.

“We can’t permit a facility on that property so we’re not going to buy that property” said Joe Fusco vice president at Casella. “But we’re going to find a place in the meantime for people that continue to be able to drop off. This is not happening tomorrow.”

Casella bought the Grow Compost business and collections operation a year ago in an effort to expand its compost services to customers around the state and to help it comply with Act 148 Vermont’s Universal Recycling Law which banned food scraps from the landfill starting July 1 2020.

Officials at Casella had planned to purchase the facility too but with a contingency to back out if they were unable to obtain the necessary permits according to Fusco.

Compost is still being collected at the facility and transported elsewhere for processing Fusco said.

Regulations for composting facilities changed in 2012 and again in 2020 according to Ben Gauthier an environmental analyst with the Department of Environmental Conservation’s Waste Management and Prevention Division. The Moretown facility had been grandfathered in and didn’t need to comply with certain aspects of the latest rules.

However to continue to operate it Casella would have needed to create a system to manage leachate according to Gauthier who walked the Grow Compost property on a site visit with staff from Casella in June. That would involve either building collection and treatment systems on site or transporting leachate to a separate wastewater treatment facility. Both options are expensive.

In addition several houses with private drinking water wells are positioned directly downgradient from the facility Gauthier said and Casella would have needed to comply with setbacks for the wells.

“They’d have to be so far back from the property line and so far back from the wells that they lost a lot of the functional area of the site” he said.

Fusco said he isn’t sure what will happen to the property. Casella is looking for another location so it can continue to expand compost offerings to its customers. The company owns other composting and food depackaging facilities in the state.

Casella had lagged on rural compost pickup part of its obligation under Act 148. Asked whether the company had since expanded its services Fusco pointed to upgrades to the company’s Bennington compost facility Long Trail Compost and its purchase of Grow Compost.

“Obviously the acquisition of the Grow Compost business was a significant step forward for us in growing our collection network” Fusco said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwODkyNjg3NTIyMDA0MzE50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Feasibility of reprocessing gold tailings: Integrated management approach for the control of contaminated neutral mine ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0892687522004319 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwODkyNjg3NTIyMDA0MzE50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vb3Bpbmlvbi5pbnF1aXJlci5uZXQvMTU2NjI0L25vLXRpbWUtdG8td2FzdGUtYS1jb2xsYWJvcmF0aW9u0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly9vcGluaW9uLmlucXVpcmVyLm5ldC8xNTY2MjQvbm8tdGltZS10by13YXN0ZS1hLWNvbGxhYm9yYXRpb24vYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No Time To Waste: A collaboration,"The Philippines named as the fourth top waste generator in Southeast Asia and one of the top ocean polluters in the world is undeniably facing a problem on solid waste management (SWM). This is a result of a combination of various factors including our rising waste generation rate and the gaps in collection segregation and recycling of waste in many local government units (LGU).

This was even exacerbated by the pandemic due to the increased health care waste from the use of face masks and other personal protective equipment as well as single-use plastics from food deliveries and online shopping. Around 1400 metric tons of health care waste was generated every day from June 2020 to April 2022 according to the Environmental Management Bureau (EMB). It also projected that from 2022 to 2025 the country’s generated waste will reach 92 million tons in total.

A 2020 report by the World Wildlife Fund also found that 35 percent of the total plastic waste produced in the Philippines is leaked to the environment while only 33 percent is collected and disposed to sanitary landfills and a measly 9 percent is recycled. These are not just simple numbers and data. Improper waste disposal directly contributes to global warming and climate change through methane emission from the decomposition and/or burning of waste.

While all these may be daunting it’s good to know that part of the solution is within our hands. The government through the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) the National Solid Waste Management Commission (NSWMC) and LGUs together with partners in the private sector—we all have a role to play in order for us to achieve a waste-free future.

What we are doing. As required by the law the DENR has already closed down 1174 open dumpsites and is looking to establish more sanitary landfills across the country to provide a safer and more eco-friendly way of waste disposal. We are also supporting the construction of materials recovery facilities (MRF) in LGUs specifically in barangays in order to help them collect segregate and recycle their waste more efficiently and reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. Just recently we have turned over newly built MRFs in Lipa City and Caloocan City with the help of our partners in Nestlé Philippines.

We believe that one way to address the gaps in our SWM system is through education and awareness. Aligned with this the DENR and NSWMC have partnered with Nestlé Philippines for the No Time To Waste campaign an information-education campaign that aims to drive new behaviors and understanding among LGUs and communities about proper SWM and its importance through webinars and capacity-building activities.

Being the first multinational fast-moving consumer goods company in the country to declare plastic neutrality Nestlé Philippines is an example of how private sector participation can help in SWM. Plastic neutrality or recovering the equivalent amount of plastic a company/organization has put in the market is also a voluntary form of extended producer responsibility which makes Nestlé Philippines an advocate for EPR as well.

Using its experience in tackling waste Nestlé Philippines helped in the development of five modules to be utilized for the campaign which are specifically targeted toward barangay officials SWM officers and community leaders. The modules tackle the following topics: (1) what waste has to do with climate change and the environment (2) climate change and Republic Act No. 9003 (3) action planning for solid waste management (4) designing an MRF and addressing limitations with alternative steps and (5) citizens’ guide to proper waste management.

Through the No Time To Waste campaign the DENR NSWMC and Nestlé Philippines hope to impart the best practices and tools on SWM to LGUs that they can apply and put into practice in their own respective communities and in turn help improve how they collect segregate and recycle their solid waste.

Like our partnership with Nestlé Philippines DENR welcomes collaborative projects with the private sector and other groups. By working together and with urgency we can succeed in tackling the plastic waste crisis.

(Representational)

The National Green Tribunal has imposed a penalty of Rs 3500 crore on the West Bengal government for the huge gap in solid and liquid waste generation and treatment.

The green court said the state government does not appear to be prioritising setting up of sewage and solid waste management facilities though according to the state's budget for 2022-2023 there is provision of Rs 12818.99 crore on Urban Development and Municipal Affairs.

Observing that health issues cannot be deferred to the long future a bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice A K Goel said it is the constitutional responsibility of the state and the local bodies to provide a pollution free environment.

The NGT noted that out of 2758 million litres per day of sewage generation in urban areas and the treatment capacity of 1505.85 MLD (by setting up 44 STPs) only 1268 MLD is reported to be treated leaving a huge gap of 1490 MLD.

It said that being part of the right to life which is also a basic human right and absolute liability of the state lack of funds cannot be pleaded to deny such right.

While there may be no objection to any central funds being availed the state cannot avoid its responsibility or delay its discharge on that pretext it said.

""Considering damage to the recipient environment we hold that apart from ensuring compliance at the earliest compensation has to be paid by the state for past violations.

""Final amount of compensation under the two heads (solid and liquid waste) is assessed at Rs 3500 crore which may be deposited by the state of West Bengal in a separate ring-fenced account within two months"" the bench said.

If violations continue liability to pay additional compensation may have to be considered it added.

The tribunal said segregation of the solid waste at source and its earliest processing nearest to the point of generation with defined destination is imperative.

""Compliance of environmental norms on the subject of waste management has to be high on priority. Tribunal has come across cases of serious neglect and continuing damage to the environment in absence of inadequate steps for treatment of solid and liquid waste"" it said.

""We are of the view that issues have been identified and monitored by the tribunal for a long time. It is high time that the state realises its duty to law and to citizens and adopts further monitoring at its own level"" the bench said.

The directions came while monitoring compliance of Municipal Solid Waste Management Rules 2016 and other environmental issues by states and Union territories.

Sergeant Josh Lockwood of the Conservation Officer Service with his trusty K9 assistant. — Nick Nault photo

The best offense is a good defence when it comes to invasive species because once they’re in they can be devastating to the local ecosystem and near impossible to get rid of.

This has been the case for zebra and quagga mussels in eastern Canada and the United States.

Zebra and quagga mussels are native to the black sea region of eastern Europe and western Asia. They came across the sea in the 1980’s on a ship ballast and invaded Canada’s Great Lakes. Since invasive species have no natural predators in a new environment the mussels spread through the Great Lakes currently reaching as far as Manitoba and into the United States.

Sergeant Josh Lockwood of the Conservation Officer Service still remembers the first boat he saw with invasive mussels on it coming into BC in 2015.

“The first boat came out of Cross Lake Texas. We examined the boat with one of the scientists from Victoria who came up and determined that it had mussels on it. They weren’t viable. It’d been out of the water for more than 30 days and they were dried. But at that point we knew we had to do something” Lockwood says.

The Invasive Mussel Defence Program was created at an integral time. Soon Lockwood was seeing more watercraft coming into the province carrying mussels.

The Invasive Mussel Defence Program which includes watercraft inspections lake monitoring and public outreach and education remains extremely effective at preventing the introduction of invasive mussels into BC waterways.

To protect the ecosystem Columbia Basin Trust and Columbia Power Corporation have helped fund the Province’s Invasive Mussel Defence Program since its creation.

During boating season watercraft inspection stations are set up on major highways and border crossings coming into BC. In 2022 there were seven permanent stations and two roving stations which require mandatory stops for inspection of all watercrafts including kayaks paddleboards and any flotation devices.

Failure to stop for inspection can result in a $345 fine under the Wildlife Act.

During an inspection an officer will interview the watercraft hauler examine the watercraft and if necessary conduct a hot water flush in areas of the boat that might contain microscopic larvae or eggs. Officers can quarantine a contaminated boat for 30 days after which any mussels will not be viable.

The program also runs a K9 unit and currently employs two dogs trained to sniff out the invasive critters.

The Invasive Mussel Defence Program has a significant reach and impact. In 2021 out of the 33300 watercraft that were inspected 17 were found to be mussel-fouled. The program prevented these watercrafts from unknowingly introducing the invasive mussels to BC waters.

Furthermore 61600 people participated in public education and outreach in 2021. Officers who conduct these educational courses encourage the public to follow the mantra: Clean Dry Drain when it comes to caring for their watercrafts.

Lockwood has worked with the Invasive Mussel Defence Program from the ground up ever since that first boat became a catalyst for the creation of the program. It’s a job that he feels passionate about.

“We don’t have any zebra or quagga mussels in any British Columbia waters so I think it is a very effective program and an important program for ecology agriculture and tourism” says Lockwood.

“I’ve been in places that have massive zebra and quagga mussel infestations. When you get out of your vehicle it smells like you’re at the ocean and everyone at the beach is wearing shoes because the mussels will literally cut your feet. It can be devastating if it gets a foothold.”

When introduced to a new ecosystem zebra and quagga mussels outcompete native species for their main food source plankton. As the mussels spread they filter more and more plankton out of the water which allows more sunlight to penetrate. This impacts fish and wildlife by increasing toxic algal blooms.

Additionally mussels can clog and damage water infrastructure such as dams community water supplies water treatment facilities fisheries and hydropower operations.

Castlegar resident Ian Kalaski has been boating his whole life. From the fishing community and online publications he’s aware of the potential for spreading invasive mussels and checks his boat regularly.

“I think the checks are important to people that are traveling in and out of province or from the ocean back into fresh water. It’s too much to determine if some people should stop and some shouldn’t so they have to stop everybody. It’s reasonable that way” Kalaski says. “I’m fine with stopping because it’s part of the program.”

“If we can maintain and maybe even increase what we’re doing now I think that we can hold where we’re at and not get mussels into British Columbia” says Lockwood.

In the letters which are dated August 25 and copies of which were provided to Rolling Stone Wells Fargo offers zero explanation for the decision to terminate the relationship with these customers. The letter says that the bank “performs ongoing reviews of its account relationships in connection with the Bank’s responsibilities to manage risks in its banking operations” and that the recipient’s accounts will be closed “as a result of this review.” Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Alana Evans the president of the Adult Performance Artists’ Guild (APAG) says that she has been a client with Wells Fargo in good standing for nearly 30 years and has had no issues with the bank. In a video posted on Twitter Sept. 2 she tearfully read a portion of the letter out loud. “I don’t bounce checks I’ve never done anything bad with my bank account I don’t have fraud alerts or do chargebacks” she said in the video. “A bank that I’ve done business with for 30 years decided that I’m not worthy of a relationship with them.” She went on to recount the impact that the decision would have on her life: “How am I supposed to pay my bills? How am I supposed to get paid?”

Spike Irons and Sofie Marie who run YummyGirl Studios a porn production company based out of Las Vegas also received a letter from Wells Fargo also dated Aug. 25 terminating their relationship with the bank effective Oct. 13.

“We’re a tax-paying business that has been operating consistently since 2016” says Irons. “Tell me how we are high-risk. Wouldn’t they have dumped us years ago?”

Adult content creator Leia Way also received the notice from Wells Fargo even though she says she had been a member in good standing for six years and was primarily using the account to process wire transfer payments from an affiliate marketing program on a cam site. “In this line of work the feeling of being discriminated never really goes away” she says. “With that feeling I am always expecting the other shoe to drop.” She is now in the process of trying to find another bank. “To have a business terminate your relationship when you’ve done nothing wrong or illegal it sucks” she says.

It appears that the Wells Fargo decision has also affected people who do not work in the adult industry anymore. Former adult performer Raylene has been out of the industry for a decade and says she’s had her Wells Fargo account for 22 years. She too received the same notice from Wells Fargo on Monday despite the only adult industry-related payment on her account being residuals from a lifetime contract with Streammate a site she says she has not used in about 12 years.

“It’s kind of messed up” she says. “If I feel unsafe in a financial institution what’s next? Did they check my background? Why would one or two deposits a year flag my account? I would feel better if someone would give me a straight answer.” The fact that she has been out of the industry for so long she says makes her even more disquieted about Wells Fargo’s decision. “You feel powerless over the external forces over corporate and religious America trying to exclude certain groups from living their lives in a free way” she says.

This is not the first time that banks have cracked down on sex workers operating in legal regulated industries. In 2014 JP Morgan Chase closed down many adult performers’ accounts without providing any explanation including Teagan Presley and Keiran Lee both of whom spoke out about the decision on social media. At the time Presley was not even in the industry and was primarily using her account to process sales from her Fleshlight and pay for her children’s gymnastic lessons.

Some speculated that the crackdowns were a reuslt of Operation Chokepoint an Obama administration-led initiative to police payment processor fraud though a 2015 internal probe found “no evidence” of this. Many banks have argued that the adult industry is considered higher risk due to the frequency of chargebacks or customers demanding refunds after making purchases though all of the producers and performers Rolling Stone spoke with denied that chargebacks were an issue on their accounts (or that they used their Wells Fargo accounts to process customer payments at all).

In recent months however there has undoubtedly been pressure from right-wing organizations like the National Center on Sexual Exploitation (formerly Morality In Media) and Exodus Cry on banks and credit card companies to sever relationships with the adult industry. Last month Visa and Mastercard anounced it would be suspending payments for ad purchases on websites like Pornhub following a lawsuit by a woman accusing the payment processors of facilitating the hosting of child pornography on the site. The owner of Pornhub MindGeek has denied knowingly hosting such content attributing such claims to “groups whose stated agenda is to shut down the adult entertainment industry.” Pornhub’s Instagram account was also shut down on Saturday a move that NCOSE in a statement took credit for.

Some performers Rolling Stone spoke with believe there is a direct link between such efforts on the part of the religious right to shut down such platforms and banks’ decisions to crack down on the livelihoods of independent producers and performers. “I feel no shame about my history” says Raylene. “[But] it’s almost like they” — meaning corporate and conservatives forces in America — “don’t want us to change or move on.” The experience has steeled her resolve to speak out against what she views as discriminatory actions taken by the banks against those in her former industry: “I want to make it my mission to fight. Because where are they going to draw the line?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd29ya3dlZWsuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDQvbWFya2V0ZXJzLWRhcmstYXJ0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marketers' Dark Arts -,"Cover design for: Richard Roland Holst Exhibition of the works left behind by Vincent Van Gogh (1892) by Richard Roland Holst.

3 Fintech News Stories

#1: Marketers’ Dark Arts

What happened?

Credit Karma got in some trouble with the FTC:

The Federal Trade Commission has taken action against credit services company Credit Karma for deploying dark patterns to misrepresent that consumers were “pre-approved” for credit card offers. The FTC alleges that the company used claims that consumers were “pre-approved” and had “90% odds” to entice them to apply for offers that in many instances they ultimately did not qualify for. The agency’s order requires the company to pay $3 million that will be sent to consumers who wasted time applying for these credit cards and to stop making these types of deceptive claims.

So what?

Three things here.

1.) One of the easiest ways to get into regulatory trouble in fintech is to use overly optimistic marketing language that can be reasonably seen as deceptive. This is example number 12287907456 of this being true.

2.) This line from the FTC’s press release is a bit concerning (h/t: Jonathan Joshua):

According to the FTC’s complaint Credit Karma knew that its purported “pre-approvals” conveyed false “certainty” to consumers based on the results of experiments also known as A/B testing showing that consumers were more likely to click on offers saying “preapproved” than those saying they had “excellent” odds of being approved. When user interfaces are designed including with the aid of A/B testing to trick consumers into taking actions in a company’s interest and that lead to consumer harm such design tricks have been described as “dark patterns.”

The purpose of A/B testing is to figure out which designs marketing language graphics etc. will be most effective in getting a customer to do something. A/B testing is a foundational best practice in marketing UX design product management and many other fields. I’m not sure if the FTC intended to convey the message that all A/B testing should be considered “dark patterns” but that is certainly the implication.

3.) More broadly the way that Credit Karma (and most companies that do customer acquisition in consumer banking) does pre-qualification needs to change. The default model for pre-qualification in the U.S. today is to get a consumer’s permission to “see if they qualify” for a lending product and then soft pull their credit file and evaluate it using the lender’s qualification criteria and then letting them know if they are pre-qualified. This process isn’t ideal from the consumer’s perspective because it’s not a guarantee. They still have to officially apply for the lending product that they are pre-qualified for and face the possibility that they won’t actually be approved.

There is a better way. It’s not common these days but instead of “consumer-initiated prequalification” lenders (and third parties like Credit Karma) can do “instant prescreen” in which a consumer’s credit file is soft pulled without their knowledge and if (and only if) they pass the lender’s qualification criteria they are presented with a firm offer of credit. No need to apply or face the possibility of being declined. There are certain constraints on how you can do “instant prescreen” but it is absolutely possible and I’m honestly a bit confused as to why more companies don’t do it this way and avoid the problems Credit Karma just ran into.

#2: Bank of America Helping Black and Hispanic Americans

What happened?

Ohh hell yes:

Bank of America Corp. started a trial program aimed at helping first-time homebuyers in Black and Hispanic neighborhoods by offering mortgages that don’t require down payments closing costs or minimum credit scores all considered longtime obstacles to narrowing the gap between White and minority ownership.

So what?

This is part of a larger wave of innovation some of it driven by the government and some of it driven by private companies to close the racial homeownership gap which is one of the most important drivers of the racial wealth gap.

An important part of this initiative by Bank of America is the caution it is exhibiting in not getting Black and Hispanic consumers into financial situations they won’t be able to handle:

Customers using the program will be evaluated for a home loan not by credit scores but rather factors such as their history of making rent utility phone and auto-insurance payments on time BofA said in a statement Tuesday.

Under the BofA program the lender is giving homebuyers down-payment grants of $10000 to $15000 so they have immediate equity in their homes.

#3: Originating Credit Cards Without Credit Scores

What happened?

Related to the Bank of America news above Citi is joining Project REACh:

Citigroup is joining a government-sponsored effort to expand access to credit in underserved communities. The bank is launching two pilot programs early next year under the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s Project REACh or Roundtable for Economic Access and Change. One program will issue credit cards to people without credit scores Banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. Wells Fargo & Co. and U.S. Bancorp are already working with Project REACh sharing bank-account data to help approve a wider swath of borrowers for credit cards.

So what?

This is the critical part of the story:

bankers say loans issued through Project REACh though small in number are performing as well as those issued outside the program. They expect the volume to increase in the coming year.

Fintech companies like Petal have been saying for a while that you can safely originate credit invisible consumers for credit cards – regular old credit cards not those funky credit builder cards – using cash flow-based underwriting.

With a nudge from the OCC the big banks are discovering that yes indeed you can.

It would be just lovely if this became the default approach to origination for all entry-level credit card products – use cash flow-based underwriting to approve applicants and then use the resulting performance to approve or decline them for more premium cards down the line.

1 Question to Ponder

If you could wave a magic wand and instantly change one thing in fintech or in the broader financial services industry what would you change?

I asked Michael Sindicich of TripActions this question in Episode 1 of The Fintech Factor (my new podcast which you should absolutely subscribe to!) and I thought he had a GREAT answer. I’m curious – how would you answer this question?

Hit me up on Twitter or LinkedIn and let me know!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL2lwd2F0Y2hkb2cuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDQvdGhpcmQtY2lyY3VpdC1zYXlzLXBhdGVudC1vd25lci1mYWlsZWQtc2hvdy1iYW5rcy1jb250cm9sLWFza2VsYWRkZW4tbm8tYnJlYWNoLWNvbnRyYWN0L2lkPTE1MTI1NS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Third Circuit Says Patent Owner Failed to Show Banks Control Askeladden So No Breach of Contract,"“Although it agreed the timing of Askeladden’s challenge to the patent was ‘suspicious’ it also agreed ‘that the LLC Agreement actually shows that the Banks do not control which patents Askeladden challenges.’”

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on August 31 affirmed a district court’s ruling that Verify Smart Corp had failed to plausibly allege an agency relationship between Wells Fargo and Bank of America (the “Banks”) and a banking industry group’s subsidiary sufficient to prove the Banks enlisted the subsidiary to challenge a patent they were contractually prohibited from challenging themselves.

Verify brought a patent infringement suit against the Banks for infringement of its multifactor-identification software. Bank of America challenged the patent but as part of a subsequent settlement agreement the Banks eventually agreed not to challenge the patent further. However following the settlement Askeladden LLC a subsidiary of the banking industry group The Clearing House Payments Company LLC (TCH) of which both banks were members challenged the patent at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) and got it invalidated. Verify then sued the Banks alleging they had breached the settlement by acting through Askeladden.

Verify argued that:

“(i) the Banks and their peer institutions own and control TCH; (ii) TCH owns and controls Askeladden;

(iii) TCH created Askeladden to challenge patents that adversely [a]ffect TCH’s owners including the Banks;

(iv) TCH controls Askeladden’s patent challenges on behalf of the Banks; and

(v) Askeladden has an established practice of suing patent owners after TCH’s member banks settle their patent challenges and it did just that here.”

Verify amended its complaint twice but the district court dismissed its Third Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim against the Banks for breach of contract and fraud because its reliance on Askeladden’s LLC Agreement “contradicted the existence of any agency relationship.” Specifically the district court said that several provisions of the LLC Agreement “suggest the opposite” such as the Agreement’s mandate that Askeladden “shall have a Patent Challenge Committee” whose purpose “shall be to independently implement manage and conduct that aspect of the Company’s Patent Quality Initiative directed to challenging the validity of low-quality patents as specified in the Patent Challenge Guidelines”; that the PCC “shall operate independently of the Executive Committee [TCH] and any other Person that is affiliated with or otherwise related to [TCH]”; and that although TCH could appoint individuals “to assist and support the activities of the [PCC]” they “shall have no authority to direct bind or otherwise control the activities of the [PCC].” The LLC Agreement also explicitly prohibited any requests that the PCC institute review of specific patents or patents of a specific patent owner “or any direction or suggestion . . . from the Executive Committee [TCH] or any other Person that is affiliated with or otherwise related to [TCH].”

The district court further found that Verify had failed to establish that the several individuals Verify identified as being associated with the Banks had “any authority to direct Askeladden to challenge patents” or that they had ever directly communicated with the Banks regarding the patent challenge.

On appeal the Third Circuit in a very brief discussion affirmed the district court’s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim explaining that although it agreed the timing of Askeladden’s challenge to the patent was “suspicious” it also agreed “that the LLC Agreement actually shows that the Banks do not control which patents Askeladden challenges.” Furthermore Verify had presented no facts showing that any Bank officer had authority or responsibility related to Askeladden.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vZmluYW5jaWFsLWluY2x1c2lvbi0zLzIwMjIvY2l0aWdyb3VwLXRvLWxhdW5jaC1maW5hbmNpYWwtaW5jbHVzaW9uLWluaXRpYXRpdmVzLXVuZGVyLW9jY3MtcHJvamVjdC1yZWFjaC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Citigroup to Launch Financial Inclusion Efforts,"Citigroup will be launching two pilot programs under the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s Project REACh or Roundtable for Economic Access and Change to help underserved communities get more access to credit.

One of the programs will get credit cards to those without credit scores and the other will assist small businesses with minority women or veteran owners to get credit. Participation in Project REACh is a part of Citigroup’s $1 billion in strategic initiatives to help close the racial wealth gap and increase economic mobility in the United States according to the company’s press release.

Project REACh already works with several banks like JPMorgan Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp sharing bank account data to approve more borrowers for credit cards.

The issue of the credit-underserved is a big one in the U.S. with around 50 million residents lacking traditional credit scores. Banks usually look at credit scores when reviewing applications for various kinds of consumer debt.

The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) wrote that information about an applicant’s income and spending habits can be as good a measure of creditworthiness as traditional credit scores.

Efforts to help the underserved have cropped up elsewhere recently including the White House debut of a new Economic Opportunity Coalition (EOC) to look at economic disparities PYMNTS wrote.

The areas of focus will include investing in community development financial institutions (CDFIs) and minority depository institutions (MDIs) supporting entrepreneurs and minority-owned businesses more access to credit and better infrastructure and housing for underserved neighborhoods.

The companies -- Leaps & Bounds Private Limited Leaps & Bounds Infra Consultants Private Limited and Leaps & Bounds Management Services LLP -- attracted the attention of the investigating sleuths after the probe agency detected some fictitious transfers of funds.

In the case of Leaps & Bounds Private Limited and Leaps & Bounds Infra Consultants Abhishek Banerjee's parents Amit and Lata Banerjee are the directors. In the case of Leaps & Bounds Management Services LLP which is a partnership firm Amit and Lata Banerjee are the designated partners. All these three entities have the same registered address -- P-733 Block-P New Alipore Kolkata West Bengal-700053ED sources said that a massive amount of Rs 4.37 crore was transferred mainly to the account of Leaps & Bounds Private Limited from a real estate company purportedly owned by coal kingpin of scam Anup Majhi alias Lala.

Agency sleuths are currently examining the books of accounts of all these three companies to trace similar fictitious transactions or transfer of funds. In all probability these entities acted as shell companies meant for the diversion of proceeds. Before the 2014 Lok Sabha Sabha polls Abhishek Banerjee himself was one of the directors of Leaps & Bounds Private Limited as per records of the Registrar of Companies (ROC) under the Union Ministry of Corporate Affairs. However before filing his nomination as a Trinamool Congress candidate from THE Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha constituency in 2014 he resigned from the company.

Amit Banerjee joined as a board member of the company on January 2 2014. However Lata Banerjee was associated with the firm since its inception on April 19 2012.ED sources said that during Abhishek Banerjee's six-and-a-half hour long interrogation on Friday the ED sleuths quizzed him about his association with the companies to which he was unable to give any satisfactory answer. After completion of the interrogation reporters asked Abhishek Banerjee on what points was he question to which he replied: ""For the purpose of the decorum of the investigation process I am unable to divulge anything on this count.""

I'll start off by saying that I did a dumb thing and that's why I'm here.

I purchased a new WD_Black NVMe SSD for my PC. I was previously using two Kingston SSDs with one being for storage/backup and the other being for the OS software games etc.

In my mind I didn't think I would need to uninstall Windows from the previous primary drive when installing to the new WD drive. I was wrong apparently. I've installed Windows 10 Pro Version 21H2 (OS Build 19044.1889) and it works fine except that it didn't create a boot manager partition when I did. So I did a lot of Googling a found a guide on how to create one but unfortunately my PC doesn't recognize it despite it being listed in the Disk Manager

So aside from having now wiped the old primary drive's free space both the boot manager and the recovery partitions are still on the previous drive. I can't seem to figure out a way to move them or clone them to the new drive.

If I try to boot directly off the new WD drive from the BIOS it attempts to install Windows and then gives me an error saying there's an operating system already present and to go to Windows (I'm assuming it's picked up the boot manager that still exists on the other drive?).

I've bumbled around with both Macrium Reflect and AOMEI Partition Assistant but haven't had any luck cloning the recovery and boot manager partitions to the new drive I'm guessing because Windows is now installed on the new WD drive so it can't be dismounted to do whatever these programs need to do.

I've Googled as much as I can at this point so here I am. Does anyone have any advice as to how I could fix this? If there's a way to get the recovery partition that would save me some time as I haven't gotten too far with software installations.

Here's what the partitions currently look like. As you can see I was able to create an EFI and Recovery partition on the new drive but I don't think they're actually doing anything other than taking up space.

Jason M. Allen was almost too nervous to enter his first art competition. Now his award-winning image is sparking controversy about whether art can be generated by a computer and what exactly it means to be an artist.

In August Allen a game designer who lives in Pueblo West Colorado won first place in the emerging artist division’s “digital arts/digitally-manipulated photography” category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition. His winning image titled “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial” (French for “Space Opera Theater”) was made with Midjourney — an artificial intelligence system that can produce detailed images when fed written prompts. A $300 prize accompanied his win.

“I’m fascinated by this imagery. I love it. And it think everyone should see it” Allen 39 told CNN Business in an interview on Friday.

In August Jason M. Allen's piece ""Théâtre D'opéra Spatial"" — which he created with AI image generator Midjourney — won first place in the emerging artist division's ""digital arts/digitally-manipulated photography"" category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition. Courtesy Jason M. Allen

Allen’s winning image looks like a bright surreal cross between a Renaissance and steampunk painting. It’s one of three such images he entered in the competition. In total 11 people entered 18 pieces of art in the same category in the emerging artist division.

The definition for the category in which Allen competed states that digital art refers to works that use “digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process.” Allen stated that Midjourney was used to create his image when he entered the contest he said.

Midjourney is one of a growing number of such AI image generators — others include Google Research’s Imagen and OpenAI’s DALL-E 2. Anyone can use Midjourney via Discord while DALL-E 2 requires an invitation and Imagen has not been opened up to users outside Google.

The newness of these tools how they’re used to produce images and in some cases the gatekeeping for access to some of the most powerful ones has led to debates about whether they can truly make art or assist humans in making art.

This came into sharp focus for Allen not long after his win. Allen had posted excitedly about his win on Midjourney’s Discord server on August 25 along with pictures of his three entries; it went viral on Twitter days later with many artists angered by Allen’s win because of his use of AI to create the image as a story by Vice’s Motherboard reported earlier this week.

“This sucks for the exact same reason we don’t let robots participate in the Olympics” one Twitter user wrote.

“This is the literal definition of ‘pressed a few buttons to make a digital art piece’” another Tweeted. “AI artwork is the ‘banana taped to the wall’ of the digital world now.”

Yet while Allen didn’t use a paintbrush to create his winning piece there was plenty of work involved he said.

“It’s not like you’re just smashing words together and winning competitions” he said.

You can feed a phrase like “an oil painting of an angry strawberry” to Midjourney and receive several images from the AI system within seconds but Allen’s process wasn’t that simple. To get the final three images he entered in the competition he said took more than 80 hours.

First he said he played around with phrasing that led Midjourney to generate images of women in frilly dresses and space helmets — he was trying to mash up Victorian-style costuming with space themes he said. Over time with many slight tweaks to his written prompt (such as to adjust lighting and color harmony) he created 900 iterations of what led to his final three images. He cleaned up those three images in Photoshop such as by giving one of the female figures in his winning image a head with wavy dark hair after Midjourney had rendered her headless. Then he ran the images through another software program called Gigapixel AI that can improve resolution and had the images printed on canvas at a local print shop.

Allen is glad the debate over whether AI can be used to make art is capturing so much attention.

“Rather than hating on the technology or the people behind it we need to recognize that it’s a powerful tool and use it for good so we can all move forward rather than sulking about it” Allen said.

Cal Duran an artist and art teacher who was one of the judges for the competition said that while Allen’s piece included a mention of Midjourney he didn’t realize that it was generated by AI when judging it. Still he sticks by his decision to award it first place in its category he said calling it a “beautiful piece”.

“I think there’s a lot involved in this piece and I think the AI technology may give more opportunities to people who may not find themselves artists in the conventional way” he said.

Allen won’t yet say what the text prompt was behind his winning image — he’s planning to keep it a secret until he publishes a larger related work that he hopes will be finished later this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDIyL3NlcC8wNC9rb3JlYS1jdWx0dXJlLWstcG9wLW11c2ljLWZpbG0tdHYtaGFsbHl1LXYtYW5kLWHSAV5odHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vd29ybGQvMjAyMi9zZXAvMDQva29yZWEtY3VsdHVyZS1rLXBvcC1tdXNpYy1maWxtLXR2LWhhbGx5dS12LWFuZC1h?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,K-everything: the rise and rise of Korean culture,"Last week I was standing in a huge dance studio – one of 12 – near the top of a funky new office tower just north of the Han River in the South Korean capital Seoul. The building is home to a company called SM Entertainment which has strong claims to have invented one of the most potent cultural movements of the 21st century the phenomenon of Korean pop music – K-pop.

Each generation creates hit factories in its own image. The “SM Culture Universe” was originally the vision of a Korean pop entrepreneur called Lee Soo-man who after a brief career as a singer and DJ studied computer engineering in the States in the 1980s. He returned to Seoul “with the dream of globalising Korean music”.

In the dance studio his nephew Chris Lee now the chief executive is talking me through all the ways in which this dream came true. To begin with K-pop idols conquered Asian charts; lately after the extraordinary success of K-poppers BTS (the biggest-selling band in the world for the past two years managed by rival conglomerate Hybe) they have been expanding their reach to all corners of the globe. New members of boy bands and girl bands – aged 11 upwards – are recruited by SM each year on long contracts and this building becomes their virtual home. It is designed as an inside-out place with every room a stage set for press conferences fan chats and livestreams; one floor is an “artist’s house” a place where “idols” can chill or do some cooking (while their fans watch and scream outside); another is a “song camp” where songwriters from across the world are flown in on rotation to create a global sound.

“One of the things we tell [new talent]” Lee says of this operation “is that they are representing our country. If you were on an Olympic team you would have to be trained and we see no difference. If they want to be the best in the world it takes a lot of work. They get media training. They study languages so that they can communicate with many different audiences. We teach them how to have good personalities.”

One of the most successful products of that system is Taeyong who joins our conversation. Taeyong is the leader of a group called NCT 127 (NCT stands for “neo-cultural technology” 127 is Seoul’s line of longitude). NCT’s last album Sticker reached No 3 on the US Billboard chart. Like all boy band and girl band members Taeyong has the bone structure and flawless complexion of an avatar and a kind of androgynous vulnerability. He was he explains spotted for his looks by SM talent agents on the street in Seoul a decade ago. “Taeyong didn’t dance well at the time” Lee says. “He didn’t rap at all. He is now the best dancer a great rapper. He has lived in this building in that practising room.”

Taeyong is 27 though he could be 17. As the leader of NCT 127 his responsibilities are onerous. K-pop bands are all about accessibility. Taeyong is in near-permanent contact with NCT 127’s fan community partly through a “digital metaverse” a kind of gamers’ dreamscape in which fans can meet virtual versions of their idols. (Two years ago SM launched a new girl band Aespa in which there are four real members and four avatar members each with detailed backstories and virtual lives.) That desire for ubiquity is not just online. “NCT 127 are one of the biggest boy bands in the world” Lee says. “But physically there are nine of them and they are in Korea. They cannot be everywhere in the world all the time.” As a result there are now NCTs in China and plans to roll out versions elsewhere in the world.

The boy band as franchise? “Not a franchise a cultural brand.”

Even before the pandemic SM was creating online concerts for its groups involving virtual reality and holograms. The current aim is “a 2.0 version of an online concert”. One recent live show featuring a roster of SM acts had an interactive livestreaming audience across the globe of 56 million.

Parents Lee suggests can be sure that their kids are in safe hands. “We don’t sing about sex or drugs or clubs. We don’t sell bad dreams but good dreams.” That spirit apparently engages K-pop fan armies not so much to lust after their idols but to protect them. There have been high-profile cases of K-pop stars taking their own lives after being targeted by online abuse. Fans of BTS and NCT not only organise 24-hour vigils and legal action against critics and trolls online but also seek to do charitable works in their idols’ names. BTS last year addressed the UN on climate change. K-pop appeals lucratively to that generation less interested in rebellion than in policing kindness and inclusion.

Before I leave his studios Lee puts up on a screen aphotograph of where it all started. The picture comes from the Shanghai Evening Post in 2000. The original SM Entertainment boyband H.O.T. had just held their first concert in Beijing and the newspaper headline coins the idea of hallyu – “the Korean wave”. “There is something very interesting in this photograph” Lee says and zooms in on members of the Chinese crowd who have the Korean flag sewn on their backpacks. “There is only one reason for that flag: because they feel perhaps for the first time that Korea is cool.”

The collective results of that Korean coolness which has flourished across the world over the past decade or more – not only in music but also in film and video games and TV and fashion and food – will be celebrated in a major exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) in London at the end of this month called Hallyu! The Korean Wave. My visit to the K-pop factory was part of a fast tour through Seoul – following the city’s principle of ppalli-ppalli (hurry-hurry) – to get a feel for where that Korean wave started and a sense of where it is likely to break next.

In the book that accompanies the V&A’s Hallyu! exhibition SM’s Lee Soo-man claims that the Korean entertainment industry has created a new paradigm for cultural export. In the past he suggests effective “soft power” – notably the cultural exports of Britain and the US – followed on from economic empire building. The Korean model by contrast was “culture first economics second”: export the idea of “Korean cool” and watch Samsung and LG Hyundai and Kia reap the benefits.

Ever since Elvis it has been understood that there is no more ardent love than that of teenagers for pop idols. One of the masterstrokes of the government of Korea was to recognise that such love might be weaponised a force for national good. This project was given greater urgency by South Korea’s fragile geopolitics. During my brief hallyu tour I spent a day up at the border with the north inside the demilitarised zone looking through binoculars across the rewilded no man’s land at North Koreans going about their business in distant mountain villages.

It is across this border that the bluntest expression of hallyu takes place. For decades the rival nations have bombarded each other with loudspeaker propaganda. From the north songs eulogising Kim Jong-un are periodically amplified. From the south in recent years the dominant beat has been K-pop – BTS NCT and Girls’ Generation – blasted through vast speakers.

According to some North Korean defectors the pop barrage is successful. Despite the ban on all outside media K-pop tracks seem to have become seductive earworms in Pyongyang. Their softly subversive lyrics have been described as “cultural Trojan horses” alongside addictive South Korean soap operas smuggled across on CDs and hard drives. “In the north dramas and films are all about making sacrifices for the leader” the defector Lee Je-son noted. “But across the border shockingly characters are seen to make sacrifices for love.” Some commentators compare the effect of samizdat and the Velvet Underground in helping to bring down the iron curtain. There is some evidence that it is having an effect not least in chilling reports of mass executions of party officials caught with CDs imported from the south.

The sense that hallyu can penetrate the most closed of societies perhaps emboldened Korean creators to believe there was no territory their work could not invade. In her book The Birth of Korean Cool (subtitled How One Country Is Conquering the World Through Pop Culture) the Korean-American journalist Euny Hong quotes Korea’s influential cultural critic Lee Moon-won about the audacity of that enterprise: “Very few countries have ever attempted to sell their pop culture to the United States.” For about a decade when K-pop and K-dramas were ascendant across Asia that ambition was stubbornly resisted. The unlikely detonator of the Korean wave in the English-speaking world was Gangnam Style the 2012 track by the Seoul-based rapper Psy that became the first YouTube video to be viewed a billion times. Gangnam Style – a high-octane dig at the pretensions of Seoul’s newly minted and plastic surgery-obsessed elite – vocalised an easy and irreverent spirit at odds with received ideas of the earnestness of Korean culture. It offered dramatic evidence that the west’s complacent sense of a monopoly on irony and nuance might be under serious threat.

The global success of Psy’s rap could be traced back to the dramatic rises and falls in fortune that have characterised Korean history (the peninsula has been invaded and colonised many times without ever encroaching on its neighbours). After the Korean war South Korea was ranked among the poorest nations in the world. With a mixture of authoritarian repression and collective will the “hermit kingdom” had by the late 1990s turned that around to look like a tech and manufacturing success story. That rise came to an abrupt end with an economic crash in 1997 when the Korean government was forced to ask the IMF for an emergency loan of $57bn. The day of that request is still known as the Day of National Humility. In order to pay off the debt there were many collective sacrifices (including a drive for gold that saw tens of thousands of ordinary Koreans donate wedding rings to the national cause).

The Seoul government still faced serious harm to Korea’s credibility as a place to do business. Former president Kim Dae-jung decided that what was needed was a massive exercise in nation rebranding. According to ministers quoted in Hong’s book: “Kim marvelled how much revenue the United States brought in from films and the UK from stage musicals. He decided to use those two countries as benchmarks for creating a pop culture industry in Korea.”

After the IMF crisis the president threw money at a new cultural content office supported by a multibillion-dollar public-private investment fund to promote Korean creative industries and individuals. The effort was galvanised by a flood of cultural imports from Japan (if one thing unites Koreans it is a long memory about brutal Japanese imperial rule). The drive to eclipse J-pop and J-movies with home-grown culture became a national obsession. Koreans couldn’t stop singing. The launch in 2009 of Superstar K Korea’s version of Britain’s Got Talent saw more than 700000 people apply to audition. By the fourth season in 2012 that number had passed 2 million.

The other strand of the Korean government’s rebranding programme was a commitment to a digital future. Broadband was delivered to nearly all Korean households by 2010. One outcome of that early adoption of technology is that the Korean wave tends to blur distinctions between real and virtual worlds. Just as K-pop stars exist both on concert stages and in an imagined metaverse so esports merge real-world competition and online gaming. During my time in Seoul I visited the futuristic HQ of T1 the “Manchester United of esports” in Gangnam. As with K-pop T1 recruits and nurtures teenage stars for its all-conquering League of Legends team. Semi-nocturnal players (the meal schedule at the T1 complex is always one step behind - breakfast is at lunchtime dinner is in the early hours) are encouraged to interact with armies of fans online before and after stadium-filling livestreamed matches. Faker – real name Lee Sang-hyeok – the star of the T1 (who looks a little more like Harry Potter than Cristiano Ronaldo) reportedly turned down a $20m salary recently to join a rival team.

For all that virtual interactivity there is too a powerfully traditional sense about much Korean culture. One night in Seoul I had dinner with 84-year-old Shim Young-soon who is the something like a cross between Delia Smith and Elizabeth David in Korean cuisine. She appeared in her daughter’s restaurant wearing stiff Korean silks. Shim has evangelised Korean cooking for 50 years and watched it grow from being the poor relation of world cuisine to an antioxidant-rich Michelin-star turn.

Kimchi is at the heart of that revolution. The spiced cabbage dish holds a unique place in Korean hearts partly because of the collective memory of kimjang the communal autumn ritual of massaging vats full of cabbage leaves with red pepper salt garlic ginger and anchovy paste. It was kimchi – fizzing and fermenting in clay pots underground – that got Korea through the harshest winters of its war-torn history.

View image in fullscreen Kimchi queen: the 84-year-old chef Shim Young-soon.

Shim has travelled through Korean regions collecting dozens of different recipes for kimchi with records dating back to the 15th century. She puts her own health mental and physical down to her adherence to the subtle checks and balances of Korean cuisine. Those viral beliefs in kimchi’s health-giving properties went properly global along with K-pop during Covid. In between brief lectures on the importance of food preparation within a fertile marriage Shim offered me a long and impassioned argument about the inferiority of Chinese and Japanese versions of the dish. At one point in a fabulous meal she had a brief coughing fit. She put that down to her daughter’s introduction of an “alien” piece of parmesan crisp on an otherwise “true” Korean dish of grilled ribs.

If Korean food wants to celebrate the native authenticity of its origins however most of the rest of its culture is exuberantly hybrid. This weekend the first Seoul Frieze art fair is taking place cementing the city’s reputation as south-east Asia’s art capital. Next month in London there is a festival of crossover K-pop and K-classical. Ten years ago the critic Lee Moon-won was suggesting that “Koreans are not good at creativity”. But just as the tiger economies had imported and copied and eclipsed western manufacturing excellence by the end of the last century Korean artists have brought home and transformed western ideas of cool.

Nowhere has that effort been more successful than in film. While Hollywood repeats ever-more bloated Marvel franchises Korean film-makers have learned that 1970s Hollywood trick of making thoughtful auteur-led films go mainstream. Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite was a groundbreaking Oscar success – the first foreign language winner of best picture - not for any kind of worthiness but for its brilliant contemporary storytelling the sharp and resonant things it had to say about inequality and class and poverty and excess – subjects about which mainstream American film is mostly silent. The Netflix blockbuster Squid Game too gave a whole new tone of voice to its playful compulsive brutal take on late-stage capitalism. Squid Game was the first non-English Netflix show to top global viewing charts breaking all previous records for the platform (in its first month it clocked up 1.65bn hours of viewing compared with what was then the previous best the first season of Bridgerton with 625m hours).

Korea has been emulating the effectiveness of those prime movers of soft power the British Council and the BBC

Its success opens up scope for more Korean exports. While I was in Seoul a very different Korean drama Extraordinary Attorney Woo was a surprise fixture at the top of Netflix’s global ratings charts above the much-hyped adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s Sandman. Extraordinary Attorney Woo is a courtroom series featuring an autistic junior barrister with case-cracking powers of recall. It proves an appetite for Korean kookiness as well as high-concept violence. The star of that show Park Eun-bin started out as a child actress on Korean television 27 years ago. She told me how gratifying it was to now be reaching a global audience. She said: “It’s fantastic that we can now share a lot more elements of Korea with the world.” There was a confidence that nothing needed to be modified to find those viewers even in the west. “What works here works outside as well.”

Bang Jinah is director of the Korean Culture and Information Service. In her 13 years in that department she has seen the Korean wave move from a ripple to a deluge. “About 10 years ago we noticed the big shift” she said. “Before that most of the coverage of Korea in the foreign press was about national defence. And now it is all about culture – K-pop K-classical K-movies. There has in this time also been a threefold increase in the number of articles.”

I mentioned to her an interesting metric the annual Good Country Index which attempts to quantify how effective countries are in selling positive ideas of themselves. Last year Korea was at No 6 in its list of global cultural influence (Britain was at No 23).

Bang smiled. What they were doing in her department she suggested was really trying to emulate the effectiveness of the British Council and the BBC those prime movers of soft power. She was surprised when I mentioned how the current British government seemed intent on starving that success story undermining the BBC slashing the budget of the “woke” British Council shutting down university creative and design courses. “Why?” she asked. “Search me” I replied. But then I guess that’s the thing about waves: for every one that advances there are always plenty of others in retreat.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRvZGF5LmluL29waW5pb24tY29sdW1ucy9zdG9yeS9vcGluaW9uLWNvbHVtbnMtc3RvcnktZGlnaXRhbC1pbmRpYS1pbmRpYW4td2F5LWRpZ2l0YWxpc2F0aW9uLWVkdGVjaC0xOTk1NzUxLTIwMjItMDktMDItMTk5NTc1MS0yMDIyLTA5LTAz0gGeAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdG9kYXkuaW4vYW1wL29waW5pb24tY29sdW1ucy9zdG9yeS9vcGluaW9uLWNvbHVtbnMtc3RvcnktZGlnaXRhbC1pbmRpYS1pbmRpYW4td2F5LWRpZ2l0YWxpc2F0aW9uLWVkdGVjaC0xOTk1NzUxLTIwMjItMDktMDItMTk5NTc1MS0yMDIyLTA5LTAz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Digital India: The Indian way | OPINION,"The digital policies that are being picked up in India do not really reflect the digital issues that are important from an India perspective. We need to focus on the digital policy issues that are of higher priority from an Indian context.

While India is hurtling in an accelerated manner towards an ever-increasing digitalisation of our economy and of our society we also need to ensure that it is happening the Indian way supporting the issues that are important from an Indian perspective.

To explain why we are not doing things the Indian way it would be pertinent to look at how we design our cities. We know we like celebrating festivals in the city. We know we have a large number of children and a large number of old people. We know we use three-wheeler autorickshaws. We know we have a large number of women in the cities. But still our cities do not reflect any of these realities and instead are a straightforward copy of western urban designs that doom our cities into chaotic disarray of people animals and vehicles of all kinds.

A city designed for India would have ensured that there are parking places for autorickshaws from where they can be hailed and used. When new metro stations are designed the flow of autorickshaws needs to be designed along with the stations rather than assuming that the autos will manage themselves and in all probability by blocking multiple lanes of the road and contributing to the urban chaos.

A city designed for India would be built with festival infrastructure so that festivals are properly celebrated in a structured manner without disturbing the people and without allowing the streets to be blocked to celebrate festivals. A city designed for India would have sufficient parks dedicated for children to play and become strong physically fit citizens and where they are not shooed away and not bullied by senior citizens awaiting the sunset. Nor are they playing on the streets removing their wickets every time a vehicle has to pass by. Where the cities have sufficient clean and safe public toilets for women. Where the places of worship and the places of work are far apart so that the proceedings of one does not affect the other. And the list goes on.

We have simply copied city plans from western contexts and plonked them into India and then we wonder why our cities are so chaotic. A similar thought is needed from the Digital India perspective. We have done brilliantly in conceptualising and building population-scale digital platforms in India. And yet from a digital policy perspective we seem to be immersed in issues that are more of a western concern than an Indian concern and we are oblivious to Indian issues.

advertisement

I have had people from the offices of Member of Parliaments reach out to “understand” issues that are being promoted in India to the detriment of the population scale platforms that have been built. As an example the restrictions placed on the usage of Aadhar snatches away the ability to provide credit at scale to a large number of people from the absolutely vulnerable sections of society. Who are we protecting through such digital policies? Who is benefitting from such policies?

Or we hear about the pressure from civil society to adopt a privacy law that mimics the European privacy legislation which is referred to as GDPR. GDPR was conceived with a very different strategic perspective. Europe has realised that it has lost out to the USA and now to China in the digital space. Hence they needed a non-tariff trade barrier (NTB) to add to the cost of US and other non-European digital companies operating in Europe or providing services to Europeans in any part of the world.

This would give a competitive advantage to European digital companies in their fight for market share from American and Chinese digital companies. This is similar to the ISO9000 standards that Europe had introduced to create a trade barrier for non-European imports into Europe. Do note that GDPR also creates a competitive disadvantage for Indian digital startups who want to target Europeans as their cost of compliance to GDPR pushes up their operating costs. Now why should India copy GDPR? Is our strategic objective the same as that of Europe?

We also do not hear about anyone taking up the issue of three-wheeler auto-rickshaw drivers not being able to carry cargo and participate in the e-commerce supply chain as the current legislation prevents them from doing so. Since it is not a western issue it is not an Indian issue either. This is quite ridiculous. Imagine if by a simple regulatory change we allowed autorickshaws to carry small packages the income of the drivers would go up the e-commerce supply chain would get strengthened and the autorickshaw as an economic asset would have higher utilisation thus increasing the asset utilisation. But since people in the west do not use autorickshaws it is not an issue in India.

The same is true for all the brilliant 'One Nation' policies. Take the example of 'One Nation One Permit' - an absolutely necessary Indian requirement. But there is lax enforcement and in many states especially in the north it impacts the income-enhancing initiatives of the enforcement agencies hence hiding behind the guise of ignorance or displaying sheer bruteness of administrative monopoly towards harassing law-abiding bus operators. They extract their pound of flesh at the cost of distressing the passengers and making the bus routes unviable. This is nothing more than modern-day piracy by those who are propped up by taxpayer money.

The same is true for regulations around EdTech. We have seen the disregard for the law of the land become even more efficient in cyberspace. When it comes to EdTech the spurious promises and poor quality content coupled with the tendency to take the entire course fees upfront so that the students cannot opt out of a poor quality offering has been a drain for parents and students and has stymied the industry.

advertisement

There is a need to create a light-touch regulation to prevent bad actors in the EdTech space from fleecing students and parents and even more importantly prevent them from wasting precious student time spent on poor content. Such regulations would help the industry grow faster and provide education in a highly scalable manner.

In fact when a digital platform gets into a click-wrap agreement with a student who is less than eighteen years of age then as per the Indian laws the agreement is ab initio null and void. So all the digital platforms that are offering services to students in India who are less than eighteen years age including video conferencing platforms being used for online education are all illegally operating in the given context. Should we not create a regulatory support structure to enable such platforms to be on the right side of the law? Should this not be the policy issue to be taken up and resolved?

The list of such digital policy requirements from an Indian perspective is quite large. However it is strange that living in India we do not see these issues. Our issues are only what the western world thinks should be our issues. And such western digital policies are actually destructive to India’s requirements. We need to have Digital India the Indian way.

TIMOTHY A. CLARY / AFP

Until the last second of the last match of her professional career Serena Williams upheld the principle that made her ""The Queen of Queens"" as she was introduced on Monday August 29 in what looks set to be her last US Open. Serena is definitely the one who controls the clock.

The tennis champion with 23 Grand Slam titles announced her impending retirement on August 9 in Vogue and on Instagram. After an extraordinary tennis career lasting over a quarter century she said she wanted to ""focus on being a mom my spiritual goals and finally discovering a different but just as exciting Serena.""

But on Monday night after her first-round win over Montenegro's Danka Kovinic the former world number one was not specific about when and where she would retire. ""I feel like I'm at a stage in my life where I am not necessarily retiring I'm just evolving from tennis. [...] It's time for me you know to evolve to the next thing. I think it's important because there are so many other things that I want to do.""

Ahead of 41st birthday which she will celebrate on September 26 Ms. Williams is about to embark on an intense new chapter in her life to the point of calling herself ""Serena 2.0."" The former tennis circuit boss has been anticipating her transition into the business world for a long time.

A must for sponsors

The best tennis player in history has already managed to build on her unparalleled record of success and popularity in women's sports by signing a dozen partnerships with sponsors of all kinds (including Ford Gucci Gatorade and even AbbVie an American company specializing in pharmaceutical research). She has not hesitated to put herself on stage in commercials like her successful incarnation of Wonder Woman for the DirecTV television platform in which she defeats robots armed with her racket.

Nike her equipment provider since 2003 has just opened an immense high-tech complex of 9 hectares named after the champion on its historic headquarters in Portland (Oregon).

Beyond her advertising contracts Ms. Williams does not intend to sit on a personal fortune estimated by Forbes at 260 million dollars (of which nearly 95 million dollars has come from tennis). The US tennis star has been a formidable businesswoman for nearly a decade through her company Serena Ventures which is involved in various sectors such as consumer services technology and e-commerce.

Founded in 2014 the company has invested in more than 60 projects including 13 ""unicorn"" startups (these are projects with a valuation of at least 1 billion dollars) including Impossible Foods (meat and cheese substitutes from plants) MasterClass (an online conference platform) and Tonal (online sports courses).

""I've always been fascinated with technology and I've always loved the way it really shapes our lives"" Ms. Williams said to The New York Times. In a sign that Serena Ventures is continuing to grow the company announced in March that it had raised 111 million dollars to accomplish its ""mission.""

While not making it an absolute priority the US celebrity makes a point of bringing new profiles into entrepreneurship. According to the Serena Ventures website 53% of the company's portfolio includes companies founded by women and 47% by black people ""because that's who we are"" the soon-to-be retiree said.

In 2009 even before launching her own investment company Ms. Williams and her sister Venus became minority owners of the Miami Dolphins NFL football club in Florida where they grew up.

'The same passion' in business as on the court

But Ms. Williams doesn't just invest and wait she also gets personally involved. She sits on several boards of directors including Poshmark a well-known online platform for selling second-hand clothes and objects. The businesswoman keeps good company. Her partner in Serena Ventures Alison Rapaport Stillman came from the investment giant JPMorgan and she can also exchange business ideas with her husband Alexis Ohanian co-founder of the social network Reddit.

""I feel like I go to sleep getting messages from her and wake up getting messages from her"" Ms. Stillman recently said in an interview with Fortune ""Nothing can replace tennis for her but looking to the future it's exciting to see that she puts the same passion into it as she does on the court.""

Like the basketball star LeBron James Serena Williams also has her eyes set on television. She signed a contract with Amazon Studios in 2021 to produce several documentary series that will air on its Prime Video on-demand service.

She does not intend to let go of the rhinestones and glitter of the fashion world either. She famously walked catwalks and launched her own collection in 2018 after breaking the aesthetic codes of women's tennis by wearing tight and flashy outfits on the courts. As her young compatriot ""Coco"" Gauff predicted ""we're going to keep seeing a lot of Serena.""

And even though fans are sad to see her go many are left wondering who the superstar athlete will pass the baton to.

Following a successful career Serena Williams announced her retirement on the cover of Vogue earlier this week. Her plans to leave after she completes the U.S. Open later this month shocked fans. And according to Williams the decision certainly wasn’t easy for her either.

“There is no happiness in this topic for me.” she says “It’s the hardest thing that I could ever imagine. I hate it. I hate that I have to be at this crossroads. I keep saying to myself I wish it could be easy for me but it’s not. I’m torn: I don’t want it to be over but at the same time I’m ready for what’s next.”

And by “what’s next” Williams means growing her family of three. She talks about how her daughter Olympia prays to be a big sister one day. And since she and her husband are open to adding another branch to their family tree little Olympia may soon get her wish.

Aside from this Williams mentioned that she also wanted to focus on other projects namely Serena Ventures. Even though she says the company is “a small but growing firm of six people” Serena Ventures has already been named one of 16 unicorn companies valued at $1 billion.

Now that Serena Williams is retiring from the tennis world other Black tennis stars have pretty big shoes to fill. Fortunately quite a few contenders are ready to rise to the occasion.

Williams lost to Australia's Ajla Tomljanovic in three sets at Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York Friday a day after she and her sister Venus exited the doubles competition after a first-round loss.

Williams is expected to retire after completing play in the tournament.

The Williams sisters helped usher in a new era of sponsorships for female athletes over their decorated careers.

Mr Jeff Kearney global head of sports marketing for Gatorade said Serena has made a permanent impact on marketing budgets everywhere and her overwhelming success convinced the Pepsico division which first partnered with Williams in 2009 to spend more on female athletes.

""Across brands and the different companies she works with they're investing more on the women's game"" said Mr Kearney.

'She's going to transcend sport'

The sports icon has worked with a number of brands beginning with a five-year Puma sponsorship at the beginning of her career that was valued at US$13 million (S$18 million).

The match was expected to be the last match of her transcendent tennis career on Friday night. Williams ended in the third round on Friday with a 7-5 6-7 (4/7) 6-1 loss.

Waving everyone good bye an emotional Serena said “I wouldn't be Serena if there wasn't Venus. So thank you Venus. She is the only reason Serena Williams ever existed.""

""It all started with my parents they deserve everything. I am so grateful to them. These are happy tears I guess"" Serena said in a video posted by US Open. ""It's been a fun ride"" she said. “It's been the most incredible ride and journey I've ever been on I mean in my life. I'm just so grateful to every single person that's ever said 'Go Serena' in their life. I'm just so grateful. You got me here.""

Williams lost to Australia’s Ajla Tomljanovic in three sets at Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York on Friday a day after she and her sister Venus exited the doubles competition after a first-round loss.

Serena has been an inspiration to many - from children to adults and has been the most successful female tennis players. Both the sisters Serena and Venus took the tennis world by storm when they emerged from the courts of crime-ridden Compton California as teenagers and went on to dominate and change the face of the predominantly white sport.

Throughout her career Serena has been associated with many big brands like Nike Wilson Intel Lincoln Motor Company and many others. Female athletes have long had to fight for what they’re worth from sponsorships or institutional pay.

Serena Williams and Brands

The sports icon has worked with a number of brands beginning with a five-year Puma SE sponsorship at the beginning of her career that was valued at $13 million as per Bloomberg report. A longstanding partnership with Nike Inc. followed in 2003 which has grown to include an in-house incubator for fashion designers. The company has also dedicated the largest building on its Beaverton Oregon campus to her. “The thing about Serena is she's going to transcend sport"" said Tanya Hvizdak the vice president of global women’s sports marketing at Nike. “She's been able to show it's beyond performance. Obviously that's provided her a platform but her engagement in so many different other aspects and showing the dimensions of herself whether it’s as a mother or a champion of diverse designers or other aspects will be her legacy.""

Jeff Kearney global head of sports marketing for Gatorade said Serena has made a permanent impact on marketing budgets everywhere and her overwhelming success convinced the Pepsico Inc. division which first partnered with Williams in 2009 to spend more on female athletes.

“Across brands and the different companies she works with they're investing more on the women’s game"" said Kearney. Another major sports sponsor Anheuser-Busch InBev SA’s Michelob Ultra beer brand has been associated with Williams in the late stages of her career with Super Bowl ads such as one alongside WNBA star Nneka Ogwumike and Women’s World Cup champion Alex Morgan. Ricardo Marques vice president of marketing said Williams played a pivotal role in boosting dollars spent on women in sports.

“Serena was a catalyst"" said Marques. “She gave confidence to brands like us to come forward and put these commitments dollars to make that support more visible.""

Apart from this Delta Air Lines Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have also been sponsors. In 2017 Tech giant Intel partnered with Serena. In 2018 Serena associated with Lincoln which is an American luxury car maker owned by Ford where she endorsed Lincoln’s Navigator SUV. In 2018 Serena Williams has launched her own apparel line called Serena. When she appeared in an inspirational Chase commercial it showed her return to the game following the birth of her daughter. Her other brands also include Gatorade Beats by Dre Audemars Piguet Bumble IBM.

The US Soccer Federation announced only this year that male and female athletes would be compensated equally and pay disparities persist for female golf basketball and tennis players. Nike also changed its pay policies for pregnant athletes after runner Allyson Felix and others alleged that they were mistreated during their pregnancies. In March the company also unveiled a new think-tank initiative which includes Williams and 12 other Nike-sponsored female athletes. According to Celebrity Net Worth Serena William's net worth is an estimated $250 million.

Support of Brands and Beyond

Support of brands also includes standing by Williams and other athletes as they navigate inequities baked into tennis. The Williams sisters were both made to endure racism throughout their careers and Serena is no stranger to calling out double standards and unfair treatment. Her sponsors have followed suit. After the French Open objected to a jumpsuit she wore to the 2018 tournament Nike tweeted its support.

“Support in those moments is key because not only does raise an element of yes that was in the arena of sport and us supporting that athlete but even more so women's rights and opportunities in that aspect"" said Hvizdak. That the jumpsuit supported Williams in both design and functionality — it provided compression to help with blood clots — underscored Nike’s commitment to work with Williams and other female athletes with regard to what they individually need she added.

“You're seeing the money come into play but there needs to be more of it industrywide"" said Nike’s Hvizdak. “We continue to lead in this space and we need to pull people with us. That’s the goal."" And although Williams may soon be bidding the tournament circuit farewell brands aren’t moving on from working with her if she’ll have them. “Her name is always at the top of the list Gatorade’s Kearney said.

“Her name is always at the top of the list"" said Gatorade’s Kearney.

Meanwhile Williams who turns 41 later this month plans to ""evolve"" away from tennis following the US Open campaign. She has also written her first children's book which will be on sale in September end.

She also clarified she will re-direct her curiosity and drive into her investment firm Serena Ventures. She’ll kindle her spiritual life. She’ll evolve as a mom. “I think I’m good at it"" she says of parenthood. “But I want to explore if I can be great at it.""

Speaking about her next i.e. Serena Ventures she told Vogue earlier this month that the investment firm has now funded 16 companies valued at $1 billion or more and that 78 percent of its portfolio are companies started by women or people of color.

Throughout her more than 30-year career Williams has used her platform to break barriers for female athletes. And with help from Nike that’s only going to continue.

For instance Nike and Williams created the Serena Williams Design Crew design apprenticeship program in 2019 to promote diversity in design and establish a new generation of design talent at Nike and beyond. In January 2020 the first group of young talents visited the brand’s headquarters in Beaverton Ore. and worked for six months to produce footwear apparel and accessories inspired by the tennis icon in the worlds of performance and lifestyle product. Since then the program has only advanced.

Tanya Hvizdak VP of global women’s sports marketing at Nike told FN that Nike currently has 13 apprentices in the program from Williams’ hometown of Compton Calif.

“Serena is extremely passionate about design. And she’s also passionate about providing opportunities to groups that maybe haven’t necessarily been afforded those platforms. And through our partnership she saw an opportunity to give designers young people passionate in that space the opportunity to work with an incredible organization and elevate them. It’s allowed for a new group of diverse individuals into our organization to really help push and bring new thought and experience into that space” explained Hvizdak.

Williams was also a central force in the launch of one of Nike’s most far-reaching platforms in years The Nike Athlete Think Tank. Through this initiative athletes are able to provide unfiltered feedback about their unique journeys and the changes they wanted to see regarding financial aspect of creating access to sport inclusion and community efforts among other topics.

“She was part of that first inaugural crew. And that really laid the foundation. I’m excited to say that we’re in our second cohort. And Serena has expressed interest in continuing to be involved” said Hvizdak.

Last month Williams covered Vogue’s September issue where she announced her plans in a verbal essay with the magazine. “I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis toward other things that are important to me” she said.

Hvizdak is excited about what the future holds. “The thing that’s most incredible is just she transcends sport. The amount of decades and generations that she’s been able to impact is just absolutely incredible. And I think what she’ll continue to bring will be even more impactful. And she spoke to that a little bit when she was talking about her retirement and how she’s excited about what the evolution of Serena means” Hvizdak said.

Hvizdak added that the tennis star’s authenticity and unapologetic self has connected with consumers through the years and continues to do so today.

“Serena is so integral into the push that we’ve seen. She’s showing what’s possible whether it’s Serena Ventures or the SWDC she continues to break glass ceilings. And that’s where you see us as a brand continuing to lean in. We continue to say that sport has the ability to move the world forward. And in Serena she just exemplifies that.”"

While I can’t remember the exact phrase (and it’s now gone) the message was geared toward new Nevada residents. It read “Welcome to those who plan to come for a year and stay for a lifetime” or something to that effect.

It was timely. More people have been moving to the Las Vegas area from California for one major reason: taxes. The state of Nevada like eight others in the U.S. (Alaska Florida South Dakota Tennessee New Hampshire Texas Washington and Wyoming) has no personal income taxes — and certain events of the past few years seem to have inspired many Americans to reevaluate finances and change their home bases.

I was perhaps one of them and had traveled to Nevada to check out a community named Summerlin located on the west side of the sprawling Las Vegas metropolis. It was on a short list of possible new residences that my husband and I entertained while continuing to spend 10 months of the year abroad for work. It seemed like a smart idea given the instability of the world and the fact that California has one of the highest state tax rates — and cost of livings — in the country. And important to us it was just far enough removed from the Strip about 30 minutes by car.

After spending a week here in summer 2022 my negative preconceived notions about living near Las Vegas shifted. Two unexpected things happened: Not only did I find the area of Summerlin entirely enjoyable but I also wanted to share it with others given its pedestrian-friendly downtown desert lifestyle quality food scene and easy access to both a major airport and the great outdoors.

Lilly Graves

A Brief History

If you’ve never heard of Summerlin you're not alone. That’s because it’s relatively new. It was the business magnate Howard Hughes who purchased the western valley rim land in 1952 for a few dollars per acre and named it after his paternal grandmother: Jean Amelia Summerlin. There was promise indeed: The 25000-acre parcel lay on a relatively flat surface jutting against the nearly 200000-acre Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area — a.k.a. the ultimate backyard. Depending on the day the sandstone mountains appear beyond Summerlin in varying shades of red: vivid streaks under the midday sun ochre hues before a desert storm or burnt orange shadows as the sun inches lower into the west.

Hughes’ land sat unused for three decades before there was finally movement with the construction of a college prep school in 1988 that helped put it on the map. It was really the 1990s that brought it to more prominence though when the community started taking shape with paved roads including a four-mile parkway that locals referred to as the “road to nowhere” while it was being constructed — a testament to how barren the area was.

In the years that followed came the development of residential communities schools offices retail centers and golf courses starting with TPC Summerlin where Tiger Woods won his first PGA in 1996. There were new resorts like the JW Marriott Las Vegas Resort & Spa and the Red Rock Resort and more additions each year including Red Rock Country Club with two Arnold Palmer-designed golf courses and the Nevada Ballet Theatre next to the Summerlin Library.

Modern Appeals

Lacking any significant history Summerlin is proud of its newness. First of all it’s clean and organized. The downtown has a tidy grid where cars drive slowly past manicured desert plants and silvery ash trees. Towering palms line uncrowded boulevards and there are built-in ponds and fountains to wander in person. It’s easy to see why the community is credited with its use of low-water landscaping and remains a national leader when it comes to water conservation.

My husband and I made it a ritual to take long walks every morning before the heat kicked in. We’d walk for 90 minutes up and down flat sidewalks enjoying the mountains peeking into view and the changing light of an early sunrise. In the evening we’d take walks along the same streets twinkling with white string lights while cicadas chirped in the distance.

The area pulls in shoppers who come for major retailers as well as dining entertainment and office space. A large manicured green space has a stage where concerts movies and events are frequently held. On Saturday mornings you can find workers unloading fruits and vegetables onto stands for the weekly farmers market while women in yoga pants walk home from an early class.

As for eats recognizable chain names like Shake Shack and Wolfgang Puck commingle with lesser-known eateries serving Mexican Italian BBQ and Asian cuisine. One sushi restaurant beckoned on a hot summer day. Entering its blackened windows we were grateful for the sunless space where a trio of Japanese chefs prepared artful rolls and iced jasmine tea.

Like the community itself Summerlin’s downtown is expanding each year. On one side of the walkable village is a sleek WeWork building and a new minor league baseball stadium (completed in 2019) home of the Las Vegas Aviators with a 10000-person capacity. After hearing the crowd cheering one night I snatched a pair of the affordable tickets online. First though it was time to explore the great outdoors.



Outdoor Pursuits

Lilly Graves

Summerlin might also be the best located area of Las Vegas for enjoying nature. First there’s the community itself with more than 150 parks and golf courses. Residents are proud to say that nearly one-third of Summerlin is designated as open space. There’s also easy access to a wide range of trails for walkers runners hikers and cyclists carved into the landscapes that connect Summerlin’s villages. A growing regional trail system is in the works and will eventually connect an impressive series of trails to Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area just a few miles from Summerlin in the Mojave Desert.

Those who have seen the Netflix documentary “Free Solo” might remember the rock climber Alex Honnold — the first person to free climb Yosemite National Park’s El Capitan vertical rock face. In the film Honnold and his girlfriend live out of a van and finally settle down in Las Vegas due to its close proximity to excellent rock climbing. We caught a glimpse of the potential peaks Alex Honnold regularly climbed while perusing the mountainous area outside of Summerlin taking a scenic drive and testing a few trails in the dry summer heat.

Lilly Graves

The small village of Blue Diamond also makes a fun day trip from Summerlin where a luxury sports car might be parked at the rustic grocery store mere feet from a field of wild donkeys. Also in town is a Trek mountain bike shop that provides rentals for enjoying the top-rated trails in the area. When you’re done riding head to the all-day eatery called Cottonwood Station for lunch.

I was processing all that I had learned about Summerlin on our last night of the trip. We had just walked to a baseball game against the Salt Lake Bees and barely waited in line to get inside. Trendy vendors served a mix of bratwursts fish tacos craft cocktails and canned beer. We sat in our seats alongside the residents and sipped local IPAs while watching a brilliant sunset and waiting for the next crack of the bat. There was a sense of home. Maybe it was America a place we’ve been in short supply of for a few years and maybe it was Summerlin.",,,,,,,,,

Now's it's building the VCP Village on 2-acres of land on the outskirts of the city. The village will be comprised of 26 tiny homes and a 3000-square-foot Community Center.

""We have an 8-to-1 ratio with case managers which is something we're really proud of. It can have deeper impact with all the veterans"" said Jennifer Seybold Executive Director of Veterans Community Project.

CBS

The goal is to thoroughly address all of the underlying causes that is contributing to the veteran's homelessness. VCP has an 85-percent success rate of keeping veterans housed who've been through the program.

""They develop personalized plans that help them get into permanent housing help them with employment"" Seybold explained.

""As military veterans I think one of the hardest things we go through in transition is figuring out what our next step is going to be especially when it comes to employment"" said Kynnie Martin Account Manger with Xcel Energy.

Martin is a post-9/11 veteran. In addition to her position at Xcel Energy she chairs a business resource group that helps veterans get jobs within the company.

""Creating jobs. It's providing training and giving them livelihood in an industry that kind of matches up to the industry that many veterans are coming from"" Martin told CBS4.

She is passionate about the VCP Village and will lead a team of volunteers at the project during Xcel Energy's Day of Service.

""Having housing as a foundation of being able to start on your path forward and to being able to move forward with your life post service is something that is needed"" Martin said.

The need for volunteer help at the VCP Village is great. Each of the tiny homes will be built by volunteer hands.

""Everything we do is community supported so the more help the better"" Seybold said.

Coca-Cola Co. McDonald’s Corp. Starbucks Corp. and Yum! Brands Inc. to the growing list of companies suspending some operations in Russia over that country’s invasion of Ukraine.

Ramon Laguarta chief executive officer of PepsiCo Inc. Purchase NY said in an email to employees on March 8 that the company would suspend the sale of beverages like Pepsi Cola 7UP and Mirinda as well as capital investments and all advertising in Russia.

“As a food and beverage company now more than ever we must stay true to the humanitarian aspect of our business” Mr. Laguarta wrote. “That means we have a responsibility to continue to offer our other products in Russia including daily essentials such as milk and other dairy offerings baby formula and baby food. By continuing to operate we will also continue to support the livelihoods of our 20000 Russian associates and the 40000 Russian agricultural workers in our supply chain as they face significant challenges and uncertainty ahead.”

Mr. Laguarta added that PepsiCo has suspended operations in Ukraine and is working to provide aid to Ukrainian refugees in neighboring countries through donations to aid agencies and the ramping up of production at other PepsiCo manufacturing plants in Europe.

The Coca-Cola Co. Atlanta released a brief statement March 8 that it was “suspending its businesses” in Russia but did not provide details.

McDonald’s temporarily will close all its restaurants in Russia and pause all operations in that market according to an email sent March 8 by Chris Kempczinski CEO to employees and franchises.

On the same day Kevin Johnson president and CEO of Starbucks wrote employees saying the company was suspending all business activity in Russia. The company has approximately 130 locations in the country.

“Our licensed partner has agreed to immediately pause store operations and will provide support to the nearly 2000 partners in Russia who depend on Starbucks for their livelihood” he wrote.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine also drew a reaction from Yum! Brands. The owner of the KFC Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands suspended all investment and restaurant development in Russia.

In Russia McDonald’s at the end of 2021 had 847 restaurants with 84% operated by the company. The chain had 108 in Ukraine all operated by the company. The two countries accounted for 2% of McDonald’s systemwide sales in 2021.

“We understand the impact this will have on our Russian colleagues and partners which is why we are prepared to support all three legs of the stool in Ukraine and Russia” Mr. Kempczinski said of restaurants closing in Russia. “This includes salary continuation for all McDonald’s employees in Russia.”

Chicago-based McDonald’s also is paying full salaries to Ukrainian employees has donated $5 million to an employee assistance fund and is supporting relief efforts by the International Red Cross.

“Across the rest of Europe we will stay focused on how McDonald’s can best help those in need both now and in the future” Mr. Kempczinski said. “We have already seen extraordinary leadership by our Ukrainian and Russian teams and I know the rest of the McDonald’s system stands ready to support the large number of refugees who have been displaced by this conflict.

“As we move forward McDonald’s will continue to assess the situation and determine if any additional measures are required. At this juncture it’s impossible to predict when we might be able to reopen our restaurants in Russia. We are experiencing disruptions to our supply chain along with other operational impacts. We will also closely monitor the humanitarian situation.”

Louisville Ky.-based Yum! has about 1000 KFC restaurants and 50 Pizza Hut locations in Russia. Independent operators run nearly all the restaurants under license or franchise agreements. Yum! is donating $1 million to the Red Cross is activating a disaster relief fund to support Ukrainian franchise employees and is matching donations from employees to charities providing relief in Ukraine.

“McDonald’s and other fast-food outlets are under pressure to withdraw from the Russian market” said Ramsey Baghdadi a consumer analyst for GlobalData March 8. “However this is easier said than done for the fast-food industry. Russia represents approximately 0.7% of the global fast-food restaurant’s value in 2020. Such a small proportion of value generation in Russia tells us that fears of losing sales is not the main factor at play here.

“The challenge that foodservice providers have is the very nature of their business model. Fast-food chains such as McDonald’s and KFC often have complicated agreements with their outlets as a large proportion of them are franchises and are not enterprises. So it becomes a much more challenging negotiation to completely stop operations compared to other industries.”

A GlobalData consumer survey released in March showed consumer concern for social causes however.
