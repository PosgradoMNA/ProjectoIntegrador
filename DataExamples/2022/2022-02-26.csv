The survey results for India revealed elevated concern about transportation and roadway safety since the start of the global pandemic. More than three out of four respondents believe transportation access is an issue in their community. In addition about 67% of respondents believe road safety is more important as more people travel by car instead of airplane or train for vacation/trips due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Safety and visibility concerns

According to 3M the poll was conducted by Morning Consult between October 9 and 26 2021 among a sample of 22000 adults in 11 countries - Brazil Canada China France Germany India Japan Mexico South Korea UK and the US. The interviews were conducted online and the data were weighted based on gender age and region. Results from the full survey have a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points.

Dan Chen President of 3M Transportation Safety Division says 'The results of our global survey reaffirm that improving road and transportation safety around the world must remain a top priority especially as the number of traffic collisions rises in many countries. Helping families get home safely has never been more important and we are committed to continuing our work in improving access to safe transportation and developing safety solutions across the globe.'

Driver Behaviour

The report said that around the world people are highly concerned about the behaviours of other drivers visibility issues and road conditions.

Top seven concerns for Indians:

Safe Reliable Transportation

People in India believe their communities should do more to help people safely access various transportation options. Seventy-eight percent of respondents believe transportation access is an issue in their community and 67% of respondents think COVID-19 has made it more important to improve road safety so that vehicles bikes and pedestrians can safely co-exist as people avoid public transportation.

More than half (52%)feel they do not have reliable and safe access to roads for driving and nearly half (49%) feel they do not have reliable and safe access to public transportation.

Ranking high among community transportation safety concerns three-quarters of parents are concerned about safely getting their children to and from school.

In 2020 the Indian government recorded 120000 deaths due to negligence relating to car crashes. On average 328 people lose their lives every day despite the COVID-19 lockdown. (National Crime Records Bureau)

Approaching Holiday Season

As the holiday season approaches Indians anticipate long-awaited travel plans and concerns around road safety are top of mind.

According to the findings:

As per the survey people in India believe their communities should do more to help people safely access a variety of transportation options. More than three out of four respondents (78%) believe transportation access is an issue in their community; 67% of respondents believe road safety is more important as more people travel by car instead of airplane or train for vacation/trips due to the COVID-19 pandemic. An equal number of respondents think COVID-19 has made it more important to improve road safety so that vehicles bikes and pedestrians can safely co-exist as people avoid public transportation.

More than half (52%) feel they do not have reliable and safe access to roads for driving and nearly half (49%) feel they do not have reliable and safe access to public transportation.

Parents' Concern

Most parents in India (79%) are concerned about safely getting their children to and from school; 40% take a school bus 35% are driven in a personal vehicle 39% take a motorcycle and 34% bike to school.

About 70% of Indians strongly agree that their community should make streets safe for children travelling to school.

The school administration said the ultra-modern facility which has a cell for holding lawbreakers will help improve security

Many people however argued the amount spent on the gate could have been used for something else like building a classroom or modern library

The gate boasts giant metallic doors a spacious office for the security guards as well as washrooms for visitors to the school.

Perhaps the most notable feature of the ultra-modern gate is a detainment cell where miscreants will be held before they are handed over to the nearest police station.

Will improve school security

According to the principal Mr Enock Andanje the existence of the facility will help bolster security at the institution.

PAY ATTENTION: Install our latest app for Android read best news on Kenya’s #1 news app

“No visitor will be allowed to the school without going through all the protocols at the gate as it will help minimize theft and drug supply in the school” the principal explained.

Details indicate that the project was funded by parents and well-wishers who were asked to contribute KSh 2000 each.

Andanje's sentiments were bolstered by Western region director of Education Stephen Barongo who graced the official launch.

“Out of the many schools I have visited Bungoma High School gate is one of the best” Barongo added.

The boys-only boarding institution is located in Kanduyi constituency Bungoma County Western Kenya.

Criticism from the public

Members of the public have however disagreed with the project and termed it as a wastage of resources.

According to them the amount spent on the gate should have been channelled towards a project that affects academics directly

Kipkoech Sang Jairus:

""Priorities upside down. Instead of investing in IT innovation centres a modern library or even a modern dairy cow to supplement income.""

Martha Omollo:

""It's in Bungoma while Ken Lusaka was governor that they launched wheelbarrows costing KSh 200000. Bungoma is known for many firsts.""

Omondi Calypso Baba:

""Blame PTA BOG and parents for passing that during the AGM and not the principal. That is their priority.""

Cyprian Ketter:

""And soon you will see several other schools going for the magnificent gates. The copying effect in Kenya is infectious.""

School performs well in academics

Despite the ongoing saga Bungoma High has continued to be a centre of academic excellence in Western Kenya since its establishment.

As a matter of fact the school that goes by the nickname ‘BG’ has year in year out remained among the top 100 performers in the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) national examinations.

It is the alma mater of several renowned personalities in Kenya among them slain businessman Jacob Juma Bishop Wilfred Lai of Jesus Celebration Centre in Mombasa and former MP for Kadunyi Alfred Khang’ati.

Federal health officials have not publicly updated their case counts in more than a week.

“CDC and FDA are conducting additional laboratory testing and investigation to better understand these cases” CDC said in an update Friday. The formula has been recalled in roughly three dozen countries.

Murray chair of the Senate Health Education Labor & Pensions Committee which oversees FDA and Casey one of the committee’s top Democrats are seeking answers from Abbott about the timeline.

The lawmakers are also seeking all internal documents and communications about complaints from consumers including the initial September report of an illness. They want documents and information about the plants’ testing and any destruction of product and audits among other things spanning back to 2017. The lawmakers gave the company until March 10 to respond.

Abbott Nutrition didn’t have an immediate comment on the letter but the company says it took swift action.

“Abbott conducts extensive quality checks on each completed batch of infant formula including microbiological analysis prior to release” Jonathon Hamilton a spokesperson for Abbott said. “All infant formula products are tested for Cronobacter sakazakii Salmonella and other pathogens and they must test negative before any product is released.”

FDA also said Friday it’s working to ease supply chain issues as parents have faced shortages across the country. The brands recalled by Abbott Nutrition — Similac Alimentum and EleCare — are major parts of the infant formula market. The agency is also working with USDA because so much of the recalled formula was part of the WIC program which provides nutrition to millions of low-income parents and young children. The recall sent dozens of state agencies scrambling.

“We want to reassure the public that we’re working diligently with our partners to investigate complaints related to these products which we recognize include infant formula produced at this facility while we work to resolve this safety concern as quickly as possible” said Frank Yiannas deputy commissioner for food policy and response in a statement last week.

As POLITICO first reported the timeline from the first illness to the sweeping recall spans months. When pressed about the specific dates FDA said the agency was told about the first illness Sep. 21. The next day the agency notified Abbott Nutrition.

The agency has said the next two Cronobacter cases plus one Salmonella case linked to the same Sturgis Mich. facility came through in November December and January without specifying when. The infants in all four cases were hospitalized. One infant died though FDA has said it’s not clear whether it was solely due to the Cronobacter infection.

The FDA initiated an inspection of the facility Jan. 31 the agency told POLITICO. Inspectors found Cronobacter sakazakii in several environmental samples taken at the plant. They also found records suggesting the company had previously found the bacteria in the plant and had destroyed product because of the issue. Product was recalled Feb. 17 about three weeks after the inspection kicked off.

One detail that’s been missed in all the confusion: FDA was actually in the plant for a routine inspection a few days after the first case was reported to FDA and CDC but it doesn’t appear inspectors were looking for Cronobacter. The FDA has so far declined to answer POLITICO’s questions about the September inspection and whether inspectors were told about the reported illness.

The plant was not inspected in 2020 likely due to Covid-19. Infant formula plants are usually inspected once a year because they serve such a vulnerable population. The agency has also not answered questions about whether all routine infant formula inspections were skipped in 2020 due to the pandemic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9yZW1lbWJlcmluZy1hYmJvdHQtbm9ydGh3ZXN0ZXJuLWhvc3BpdGFscy10d28tZm91bmRlcnMvNjAwMTUwODQ5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Remembering Abbott Northwestern Hospital's two founders,"Amos Abbott and Harriet Walker rest near each other at Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis their legacies linked as the founders of two hospitals Abbott and Northwestern that would merge decades after their deaths. But their lives were worlds apart in 1863.

Born to missionary parents in India in 1844 Abbott sailed with his parents at age 3 to Boston. He was studying law at Dartmouth College when the Civil War erupted prompting him to join a New Hampshire regiment as a drummer boy at 18. In 1863 he was taken prisoner but escaped with the help of an enslaved person from a Confederate prison.

Harriet Walker from “History of the City of Minneapolis Minnesota” by Isaac Atwater 1893.

That same year Harriet Hulet turned 22 and married Thomas Walker a former classmate at Baldwin University in Berea Ohio where she'd studied music. Her husband a government surveyor and onetime grindstone salesman had worked for her father and would become a leading figure in Minneapolis as a lumber magnate and art collector; they started the Walker Art Center in their home in 1879.

""Gifted in mind and consecrated in heart she is a leader among women"" according to a profile of Harriet in an 1893 history of Minneapolis. Harriet Walker ""forsakes the avocations of the merely elegant woman and devotes herself ... to the services of the poor despised and needy"" the Rev. N.C. Chapin wrote.

Harriet Walker beat Abbott to Minneapolis by 13 years moving there in the spring of 1864 with her new husband. When Harriet wasn't raising eight children or launching Northwestern Hospital for poor women and children she was known to write hymns and poetry.

Abbott required hospital care after his prison break and that's when a physician urged him to forsake the law for medicine. After mustering out as a private he studied medicine at Georgetown Medical College in Washington D.C. He stayed connected to the Army working in the payroll department and occasionally delivering messages personally to President Abraham Lincoln.

On April 14 1865 Abbott arrived late for a performance of ""Our American Cousin"" at Ford's Theatre. ""As he approached he saw a man running from the theater. It was John Wilkes Booth who had just assassinated President Lincoln"" wrote Dr. Robert Scott a retired internal medicine physician who practiced at Abbott Northwestern for 41 years.

Digging through papers at the Minnesota Historical Society Scott researched and wrote ""Abbott Northwestern Hospital 1882-Present: A Celebrated History"" which was published in 2016 (www.tinyurl.com/AbbottNWbook).

Because Abbott Northwestern ""had been delivering health care in Minneapolis for more than 100 years"" Scott wrote ""I thought such a history was needed.""

Scott's book dissects 23 specialties at the hospital which merged Abbott and Northwestern hospitals on paper in 1970 and physically in 1980. He starts the book with the intriguing backstories of founders Abbott and Walker.

Amos Abbott.

After Abbott left the Army job in 1868 he studied medicine at what became Columbia University's medical school. He first practiced medicine in Delhi N.Y. where he met Helen Griswold Wright a descendant of a Revolutionary War general. After he moved to Minneapolis they married in 1880 and had five children two of whom died young.

The Abbotts built their home on 2 prime acres purchased for $1.50 per acre along Lake Minnetonka's Bracketts Point. He commuted 24 miles round trip by train daily to Minneapolis to treat patients.

At first renting small houses as makeshift clinics Abbott took over a girls' school in 1902 that occupied a three-story yellow brick house in what is now Minneapolis' Stevens Square neighborhood. Abbott Hospital became the city's first private surgical center.

With 15 beds and no elevator in the house an attendant named Jamey often slung patients over his shoulder to move them from the operating room to the second floor according to Scott's book.

Over the years Abbott became an expert in childhood bowel surgeries. He taught classes in anatomy and gynecology becoming ""one of the most prominently known physicians of the city"" the Minneapolis Star said when he died at 83 in 1927.

Harriet Walker was 40 when she gave birth to her eighth child Archie in 1882. Concerned about the poverty and disease affecting local mothers she invited 44 of the city's society women to a tea to raise money for a hospital to care for them.

Northwestern Hospital for Women and Children was born in 1882 in a rented home with room for 10 patients at 25th Street and 4th Avenue. The hospital's first elected officers were all women and Walker would serve as president from Day 1 until her death in 1917 at 75. Of the first 97 patients 74 received services for free.

At first their work for the destitute women in Minneapolis — ""the frail and despairing subjects of their ministry"" — was unpopular in the community. But according to the 1893 city history ""little by little their work gained in public appreciation.""

Greg Abbott asked Texas retailers Saturday to voluntarily remove all Russian products from their shelves.

Abbott tweeted that he had made the request of members of the Texas Restaurant and Texas Package Stores associations as well as all other retailers. “Texas stands with Ukraine” he wrote.

The request came days after Russia began its assault on Ukraine in Europe’s largest ground offensive since World War II. Ukraine’s health minister said Saturday that 198 people including three children had been killed and more than 1000 wounded.

Abbott’s tweet was met with mixed reviews with some replies calling it “performative” and “pointless” because the products were already paid for.

But others including Jason Villalba CEO of the Texas Hispanic Policy Foundation and Republican former state representative were quick to thank Abbott for his efforts.

“We must stand with our brothers and sisters in Ukraine” Villalba tweeted. “Every measure helps especially those that impact the pocketbook.”

Restaurants ready to support

Some Texas restaurants have already started replacing Russian products on their own accord and many others will likely be on board with the action said Emily Williams Knight president and CEO of the Texas Restaurant Association.

“Restaurants just continue to stand up” Knight said. “I’m humbled by how they pulled together and how they continuously support their community here in Texas and abroad when they’re still clearly in their own crisis trying to come out of the impact of COVID-19.”

Knight said the association is in solidarity with Ukrainians and told restaurants it would support them if they replace Russian imports of alcohol or food with alternatives.

Knight said the past few years have been tough for restaurants but through it all the group’s members support others whether it be an ice storm or the situation in Ukraine. She said it’s too early to see what the impact of the conflict in Ukraine will be on restaurants — the association is watching how the rising cost of fuel will affect the cost of supplies.

“Now I think what you’ll see is they’ll come together again to support Ukraine and to ensure that they’re doing their part and frankly whatever they can do to be supportive in this incredible tragedy” she said.

Lance Lively executive director of the Texas Package Stores Association said in a written statement that the group sent its prayers to those who are suffering.

“TPSA members are proud to support the people of Ukraine and stand ready to support economic sanctions by removing Russian imports from our stores” Lively said.

In Oak Lawn Alexandre’s bar said in a Facebook post it was getting rid of its Russian spirits and would have Ukrainian vodka next week. The bar also introduced a shot whose name was an expletive-laden message to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Texas barbecue restaurant owner Skeeter Miller called the action “a great move” and said he doesn’t have an issue with pulling Russian products off the shelves.

Miller said he considered the cost of pulling products — mainly alcohol — off the shelves “but this is a serious situation.”

On Saturday afternoon he said all six restaurants in his 47–year-old business The County Line had already been told to pull Russian vodkas. Miller has two locations each in Austin and San Antonio and one in El Paso as well as a restaurant in Albuquerque N.M.

”We’re sick about what’s going on over in Ukraine but we’re here to support in any way that we can” Miller said.

‘This is our sanction’

Several governments around the world have made the same request of their businesses while some restaurant and bar owners took it upon themselves.

The Jacob Liquor Exchange in Wichita Kan. removed more than 100 bottles of Russian vodka from its shelves and stored them in the backroom even pouring some of it on the ground.

“I guess this is our sanction … and this may be small but every small thing makes a difference” store partner Jamie Stratton told KSNW-TV. “But I’m not going to put it on the shelves. There’s no reason for it to be here. We’re not supporting them.”

In Bend Ore. a bar owner filmed himself pouring out all of his Russian vodka.

“Russia is acting as though it’s 1939 and going into Europe with a full force that they have in the Ukraine” Bill McCormick owner of Pine Tavern told KPTV-TV. “I am so concerned about it metastasizing into other countries.”

In Ontario Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy directed the provincial Liquor Control Board to have stores remove Russian vodka and other alcoholic products The Canadian Press reported.

“Ontario joins Canada’s allies in condemning the Russian government’s act of aggression against the Ukrainian people and we strongly support the federal government’s efforts to sanction the Russian government” Bethlenfalvy said in a written statement.

Greg Abbott issued an opinion that a number of sex change procedures completed on minors constitutes child abuse.

Following a similar letter by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton Abbott gave his opinion to the Texas Department of Family and Protective services. Abbott wants licensed professionals and the general public to report parents of transgender children. He called on the department to investigate these parents for child abuse.

On Sunday supporters of the LGBTQ community in Corpus Christi gathered for a monthly Diva Brunch. There we heard from people on what they thought on Abbott's comments.

“It really bothered me as a trans-woman because I feel like Greg Abbott is trying to further marginalize a population that is already living on the fringes of society” said Lisa Perry the 2021 Miss Gay Corpus Christi.

Many local leaders attended the fundraising brunch. Of them were Eric Holguin president of LULAC Para Todos and Dr. Nancy Vera president of Corpus Christi American Federation of Teachers. They called Abbott's opinion an attack on children.

“We’re a community of family and family means we accept and love everyone"" said Holguin. ""And that’s something we at LULAC Para Todos really advocate for is whether you’re transgender or gay or bisexual or non-binary whatever you identify as you should be accepted into community unconditionally.”

""As a 35 year educator where I've educated the gamuts from rich to poor gay and straight LGBTQIA+ students who have been battered and all sorts of issues I think it's an asinine idea"" Vera said. ""That Gov. Abbott has had to try to dismiss transgender students in the classroom. I think it's an obscenity as far as I'm concerned. I think that his off-the-cuff ideas or mandates don’t need to be in our classrooms. We need to accept children for who they are and teach them equitably and teach them about themselves.”

Holguin and Perry both said Abbott's comments were a political ploy

“I think he’s pushing his own personal agenda and as a representative he needs to really represent his community"" Perry said. ""And his community is not cis white men. His community is a diverse group of people. And he really needs to accept and love and support all of his community.""

Members from both sides of the political aisle were out at the Diva Brunch.

""We don't really see events like this in Corpus Christi so it's dying to see it"" Holguin said. ""And we're open to everyone attending whether you're Republican or Democrat as long as you believe and support the LGBTQIA+ community then you're more than welcomed and accepted and loved here.""

ABBV,AbbVie,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAyLzI3L2lmLXlvdS1pbnZlc3RlZC0yNTAwMC1pbi1hYmJ2aWUtaW4tMjAxMy10aGlzLWlzLWhvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,If You Invested $25000 in AbbVie In 2013 This Is How Much You Would Have Today,"The company spun off from healthcare giant Abbott Laboratories nearly a decade ago.

AbbVie (ABBV -0.65%) is one of the top healthcare companies in the world with a market cap of $256 billion. That's a higher valuation than Abbott Laboratories' $209 billion which AbbVie spun off from in 2013.

The stock has been a major performer for shareholders. But just how much would you have made if you'd invested $25000 in AbbVie when it first began trading?

Today your shares would be worth more than $100000

The stock debuted on Jan. 2 2013 as a spin-off from Abbott Labs and it was priced at $35. If you'd invested $25000 into the company then that would have secured you about 714 shares of the healthcare business.

Currently the stock trades at around $145 putting the value of those shares at roughly $103530 a return of 314% -- not including the dividends the company paid over that time.

AbbVie's dividend payout is 3.8% which is well above the S&P 500 average of 1.3%. And the company has also been increasing its dividends growing them from $0.40 in 2013 to $1.41 today for an increase of 253%. For income investors that gives them an extra incentive to hold on to the stock for the long haul getting more for their original investment.

When including the dividend payments AbbVie's stock since trading publicly has soundly outperformed not just the S&P 500 but Abbott Laboratories.

Why has the stock done so well?

Beyond being attractive for its dividend AbbVie has also been a growth machine. In just four years its revenue of $28.2 billion in 2017 has soared to $56.2 billion this past year. And its net income has increased by 117% during that time from $5.3 billion to $11.5 billion. The business is consistently profitable earning a 20% profit margin over the past 12 months.

Back in 2017 the company had 11 key drugs contributing to its revenue with rheumatoid arthritis medication Humira leading the way at $18.4 billion accounting for 65% of all net sales. Today AbbVie has more than 20 drugs itemized on its earnings report as being key contributors. Humira's sales of $20.7 billion will likely decline in the future as it faces losses in exclusivity but the business isn't as dependent on it -- just 37% of its revenue comes from that drug. AbbVie closed on a $63 billion acquisition of Botox-maker Allergan in 2020 that has given it a whole new segment focused on aesthetics and that makes the company even more diversified.

Is it still a buy today?

Today AbbVie's stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 10 which is still relatively modest when compared to other notable healthcare companies including Abbott Laboratories and Eli Lilly which trade at 24 and 28 times their future earnings respectively.

There's considerable value here from an investor's standpoint as AbbVie can be a great source of recurring income with its juicy dividend yield and the business is well-positioned as doctors and hospitals resume their usual operations.

Although there are concerns about the loss of revenue from Humira as it begins to lose exclusivity next year AbbVie's business looks to be in solid shape and a diverse portfolio of drugs will help it keep growing for many years to come continuing to reward investors who hold on.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Awards include the biggest and fastest (in combination) 5G network the fastest average 5G speeds (Up- and Download) and the highest 5G availability.

connect: The telecommunications magazine connect conducted again its famous and traditional mobile network test together with umlaut (part of Accenture a global full-service cross-industry end-to-end company that offers advisory and engineering services). The result shows that Sunrise UPC now runs Switzerland’s biggest and fastest (in combination) 5G network and the Sunrise UPC network has won connect’s “Outstanding” award the sixth year in a row.

OpenSignal: According to OpenSignal (the independent global standard for understanding the true state of the world’s mobile networks based on measurements of real user experience) Switzerland 5G Experience Report November 2021 Sunrise UPC has registered in in average the fastest 5G speeds in both the uplink and downlink. It also provides the 5G network in Switzerland for a leading mobile gaming and video experience. Of the seven 5G awards OpenSignal has set up only Sunrise UPC manages to win awards in all seven categories.

Opensignal also benchmarked the Global 5G Experience in the «5G Global Mobile Network Experience Awards 2021» in November 2021. The results show that the Sunrise UPC 5G network is also setting standards across Europe: The Sunrise UPC 5G network won the highest number of awards of all 5G networks in Europe (eight out of nine) which makes it one of the leading 5G networks in the world.

Why Is Sunrise UPC Such a Success?

Sunrise UPC continues to build the highest quality 5G network in Europe with wide coverage and high speed.

Network quality has proven to be a key factor for operators in Switzerland to win market shares in the saturated and very competitive market. As one of the first operators in Europe to launch 5G in such a capacity Sunrise UPC has placed a strategic focus on relentlessly improving network quality. Since its 5G commercial debut in March 2019 Sunrise UPC has quickly expanded its Highspeed 5G coverage in the high bands (3.5-3.8 GHz) from 150 cities and towns to more than 1000 and its Basis 5G coverage in the low bands (700-2600 MHz) from 0% to over 96% of the Swiss Population making it one of the largest 5G network in Europe.

BladeAAU Pro Simplifies Network Construction Helps Bring 5G to 95% of the Population

Sunrise UPC lags behind the incumbent in terms of its physical sites and another challenge is that over 90% of its sites are single-pole sites and many sites provide only limited space for antennas. A 5G network has to be built at the same site where 2G 3G and 4G networks have already been there. This makes antenna space wind resistance and tower load bearing major challenges to base station deployment. And it can take months or even years to get authorities’ approval for changes such as an antenna length change. To build a new 5G network involves extensive complex and time-consuming reconstruction of its antennas.

To better address above challenges and meet market demand Sunrise UPC opted for Huawei BladeAAU Pro in the early stages of its 5G deployment. This simplified solution integrates active and passive antennas as well as multiple frequency bands and radio access technologies into one box to simply deployment and packs as much into the limited antenna space. In addition to packing so many technologies into such a small form-factor it features large bandwidth on all frequency bands and can be mounted at a high height with little wind resistance. It improves coverage shortens site construction and can flexibly adapt to various deployment scenarios. It is estimated that Sunrise UPC has spent significantly less time constructing these sites in some cities than they would otherwise given the different complex frameworks for authority approvals in various regions of Switzerland. This has no doubt helped greatly in their achievement as Switzerland’s leading 5G network operator.

C-band/Sub-3 GHz Dual-Band NR Improves 5G Camping Ratio and Delivers High-Speed 5G

C-band Massive MIMO has become an industry-wide pursuit following the rapid growth of 5G. C-band Massive MIMO can be co-deployed with 1.8 GHz at the same site and provides at least 10 times better the experience of 4G. Sub-3 GHz on the other hand can provide wider network coverage because of its low interference and path loss. Sunrise UPC makes C-band Massive MIMO a prerequisite for all extensive network construction and utilizes 900 MHz to compensate for the uplink coverage of C-band in indoor scenarios requiring in-depth coverage. NR with C-band and sub-3 GHz keeps users on 5G networks delivering a high-speed 5G experience across the entire network and throughout services. The peak experienced speeds has reached almost 2 Gbps. According to OpenSignal Sunrise UPC has achieved the highest average 5G speeds in Switzerland with a 199 Mbps downlink and 39.3 Mbps uplink.

Joint 5GtoC and 5GtoH Development Brings Success to Sunrise UPC’s Business

The 5G traffic is an important indicator for evaluating how comprehensive an operator’s 5G operations are. Sunrise UPC’s 5G traffic ratio exceeds 14%;that is its 5G networks carry more than 14% of its entire mobile traffic. This is a significant milestone considering the strict electromagnetic field (EMF) thresholds in Switzerland (10 times stricter than recommended in Europe). Initially the C-band power of Sunrise UPC was limited to no more than approx. 10% of the international standard values by strict EMF regulations. However a statistic correction factor of up to 10 dB can be applied to the max. ERP (Effective Radiation Power) of adaptive antennas with more than 8 subarrays. At the 2021 Global Mobile Broadband Forum (MBBF) in October Elmar Grasser CTO of Sunrise UPC pointed out that 5G carries more than 14% of the traffic in Switzerland. According to Sunrise UPC 5G traffic continues to increase quickly .

5GtoC: 5G High-Speed Packages for “Experience Upgrade”

Rapid deployment of 5G networks and rapid proliferation of 5G devices have enabled Sunrise UPC to release its 5G packages targeting and attracting a large number of postpaid subscribers. More than 50% of 5G subscribers use an iPhone in Switzerland and as many iPhone users intend to upgrade to iPhone 13 Sunrise UPC leverages service differentiation based on this “experience upgrade” to deliver high-end 5G service experience to iPhone users. In response a large number of iPhone users have made the upgrade and upgraded their packages accordingly. This has expanded a lucrative section of Sunrise UPC’s user base and supported the growing number of postpaid mobile users.

5GtoH: TV+FWA Service Connects the Unconnected Exploring Innovation with Ecosystem Partners

5G Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) is now capable of providing high-bandwidth wireless broadband services with huge capacity. Therefore FWA has been used widely to extend connections to the unconnected increase the speed of broadband services enable fiber-like experience and Sunrise UPC took the initiative to provide 5G FWA services for residential and enterprise users in areas not covered by fast landline connections enabling homes and small- and medium-sized enterprises to access high-speed Internet services over the air.

Elmar Grasser said Sunrise UPC offers fiber to the home (FTTH) hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) and 5G FWA home broadband solutions. And when combined these hybrid fiber network offerings make gigabit speeds available to more than 90% of homes across Switzerland and deliver home users a best-in-class experience. In addition to this Sunrise UPC offers TV new with a FWA service. This high-quality TV service provides up to 240 channels and supports a maximum of six devices at the same time. Sunrise UPC has also introduced exclusive innovative services such as Apple Music and 4K cloud gaming attracting a large number of new users.

With its joint 5GtoC and 5GtoH development strategy Sunrise UPC leads Europe by hitting over 14% 5G traffic ratio. This means that user traffic is continuously retained on 5G networks with their end-to-end 5G network and user experience and improved operations. Ultimately a 5G traffic ratio increase is a core indicator of 5G business success. As Elmar Grasser said outstanding network quality is the basis for business success. To be first in 5G services one must stay ahead of network quality. In addition to good 5G networks Sunrise UPC also boasts a strong fixed network strategy. Combining this strategy and 5G FWA Sunrise UPC is given a competitive edge providing a unique hybrid fiber network infrastructure in Switzerland and benchmark setting network services to attract more users.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFjdGlvbm5ldHdvcmsuY29tL2dvbGYvbWlja2Vsc29uLWxvc3QtZW5kb3JzZW1lbnRzLWJlY2F1c2UtaGUtdG9sZC1zcG9uc29ycy10aGV5LWNvdWxkLWR1bXAtaGlt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mickelson Lost Endorsements Because He Told Sponsors They Could Dump Him,"On February 26 2010 12 years ago to this day Gatorade dropped Tiger Woods immediately dumping the sporting world’s top endorser and said it no longer saw a role for the golfer in its marketing.

It was third brand to drop Tiger following moves by AT&T and Accenture. Eventually Gillette and Tag Heuer followed. Nike stood by his side despite it pulling his TW branded products off the shelves.

The world understood these moves.

Woods‘ publicized car accident in his driveway revealed the story of his infidelity that lead to a costly divorce and a clinic to rehabilitate himself from an apparent sex addiction. Simply put: Tiger Woods was invested in not only because he was great but because he was as squeaky clean as they come. When that wasn’t the case the business world turned on him.

Now Tiger’s longtime foil Phil Mickelson has similarly lost it all but in a way that no one in the history of sports endorsements has ever lost deals.

But was what Mickelson said so awful? How could he lose all these deals? The answer? Mickelson allowed them to drop him. Let’s run it back for context.

When players went to the Saudi International earlier this month Mickelson took the opportunity to talk about the why the Saudi Golf League a competitive business which has sought to lure the world’s best golfers had merit against the background of what the PGA Tour currently offers.

“If the tour wanted to end any threat [from rival leagues] they could just hand back the media rights to the players. But they would rather throw $25 million here and $40 million there than give back the roughly $20 billion in digital assets they control” Mickelson told Golf Digest. “They also have access to my shots access I do not have. They also charge companies to use shots I have hit.”

Mickelson’s math was that PGA Tour players got 26 percent of revenues while the PGA Tour shot back and said its revenue sharing was actually 55 percent in line with other leagues. To be fair no player in any major sports league ever owns the rights to their own video on the field of play and yes leagues can sell that video to companies for use. This practice has been happening in the NFL and NBA since the early 90s.

Nevertheless Mickelson pushed further saying that “the Tour’s obnoxious greed has really opened the door for opportunities elsewhere.”

If we’re scoring at home what Phil says is uncomfortable but he doesn’t lose any endorsement deals from this. He’s needling the PGA Tour but it’s not deal breaking.

Then came his comments to veteran golf writer Alan Shipnuck. This time he addressed the elephant in the room about the Saudis.

“They’re scary motherf—— to get involved with” he said. “We know they killed [Washington Post reporter and U.S. resident Jamal] Khashoggi and have a horrible record on human rights. They execute people over there for being gay. Knowing all of this why would I even consider it? Because this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape how the PGA Tour operates.

""They’ve been able to get by with manipulative coercive strong-arm tactics because we the players had no recourse. As nice a guy as [PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan] comes across as unless you have leverage he won’t do what’s right. And the Saudi money has finally given us that leverage.”

While this wasn’t technically smart to say because Mickelson is now hurting his own leverage by bashing the Saudis does it lead one to lose all of his endorsements?

The answer again is no.

To this point two companies — KPMG and Amstel Light — have dropped Mickelson. Mickelson’s Amstel deal is small but his KPMG deal is huge and it’s a 13-year relationship.

Here KPMG which has offices in Saudi Arabia takes huge risk in dropping him because to that point no moral clause had likely kicked in. Did he say uncomfortable things? Yes. Does he say things that are morally reprehensible. No.

Complicating things further in comparing Mickelson’s situation to Tiger is that it’s a tougher choice because the “offense” is less clear and frankly companies knew at the time that Woods would be irrelevant for a while.

Mickelson isn’t. He‘s the reigning PGA champ. He captained the Ryder Cup in a blowout. And for what it’s worth he won four of his first six starts on the PGA Champions Tour.

But then comes Phil’s statement or half apology. And it’s actually in the apology that Mickelson opens the door to lose the roughly all of the $40 million in annual endorsements.

Although Mickelson’s 530-word apology was all over the place he says in the first paragraph the words he used were reckless and offensive. That alone activates morals clauses. The subject himself acknowledges that what he said was damaging.

Then Mickelson does what I’ve never seen in 21 years of reporting on the business of sports. Mickelson in his apology says I understand if you cut your deals off with me.

“I have given all of (my sponsors) the option to pause or end the relationship as I understand it might be necessary given the current circumstances” Mickelson wrote.

Mickelson is a loner. Only a “yes man” agent would approve that apology and no lawyer would ever allow him to say what he said.

After Mickelson’s words why wouldn’t sponsors dump him? There’s no legal exposure after he opened the window. And his sponsors jumped at the opportunity. Workday was next and Callaway chose to hit pause.

Yes Mickelson didn’t say things that were ideal for his future relationships with the Tour or the Saudis but his most financially damaging comment was in his apology where he allows companies the out. Thoughtful? Yes. Millions of dollars in losses? Yes.

Mickelson has likely lost more money than he would have made as a guarantee for his first year in the Saudi Golf League.",,,,,,

Shoot RAW (you can do it with Lightroom!)

Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority

The first Lightroom tip we can give you is to shoot RAW if your phone supports it. Check out our dedicated post if you don’t know what RAW is. In a nutshell a RAW photo is an uncompressed image file. It stores more data and offers advanced editing freedom. A user can adjust white balance exposure pull more detail and more without affecting image quality as much. On the contrary JPEG files are compressed edited by camera software and have less data to work with. More: Learn what RAW is and why you should take advantage of it

Not all smartphones output RAW image files but it is becoming more popular with the latest handsets. One of Lightroom’s main features is that it can edit RAW photos. And not just your phone’s RAW files; it’s possible to transfer other cameras’ RAW images to your phone’s local storage and edit them using the mobile app. Alternatively one can use cloud syncing to upload pictures through another computer tablet or smartphone then edit them on Lightroom mobile. Pro tip: If your stock camera app can’t shoot RAW you can take advantage of Lightroom’s camera function. The Lightroom app has its camera function and supports RAW output.

Take a look at Lightroom presets

Think of Lightroom presets as filters but they are more customizable and can be pretty complex if you dig into them. When editing a photo scroll through the options below to find the Presets section. Select it and you can look through a series of effects and edit styles to quickly choose from.

Not liking the presets you see? You can create your own or even download them. Many photography enthusiasts and professionals online offer their presets for download (often for a price). These can be synced to your mobile device via the cloud using the desktop Lightroom app.

Presets are nice quick edits for those who don’t want to spend much time tinkering with post-processing. Keep reading if you want more control over your shot’s outcome.

Unedited photo Using Lightroom preset ""Turquoise & Red""

I looked through available presets until I found one that didn’t change the integrity of the image too much but enhanced the colors and overall look of the photo. Turquoise & Red was under the Creative section of the Presets. This is a demonstration of what you can achieve with a simple preset. This preset will be removed and I will edit the photo myself throughout this article.

Fix exposure and lighting in Lightroom

Smartphone cameras mostly do a good job exposing an image correctly but they sometimes get things wrong. Sometimes creativity calls for a darker (or brighter) image than what would be considered “correctly exposed” too. Regardless playing with exposure controls should be your first move.

You will find these options under the Light button at the bottom of the screen. Pay close attention to the exposure slider. Move it left and right until you find the correct levels. Play with the contrast highlights shadows whites and blacks to achieve the right lighting effect.

Unedited photo Fixed exposure

Increased exposure to brighten the image.

Reduced highlights and whites to get more detail from the clouds.

Increased shadows and brightened blacks to get more detail from foliage and building.

Increased contrast for more striking colors. Related: Learn to shoot photos in manual mode

Fix white balance

To fix the white balance go to the Color section. White balance is customized with the temperature and tint sliders. Temperature can make an image more blue or orange while tint goes from green to magenta. Also: What is white balance?

You can play with these creatively to add special effects to your photos. If you are looking for a realistic white balance you can also use the eyedropper tool. Simply tap on the eyedropper icon and select a white or neutral color (gray) area within your shot to achieve an accurate white balance.

Fixed exposure Fixed white balance

Make colors pop

The color section will also have vibrance and saturation sliders. I like using these to make colors pop more but you can also move them to the left to mute them. Just be careful not to go too crazy with these options. Increasing the vibrance and saturation by much can give your images an over-processed look. Also read: What are the M A S and P modes on your camera?

Fixed white balance Fixed colors

Increased saturation and vibrance to make colors pop more.

Reduce noise

Got a grainy image? This is common when taking shots in the dark as the ISO needs to be increased therefore producing more noise. Images can be cleaned up by going to the Detail section and using the noise reduction slider. Be careful not to use it too much as it softens images. This can reduce detail and make skin look too smooth.

By the way you can also add grain if you want to give your photos an interesting look. The grain amount slider is under the Effects section.

Fixed colors Fixed noise

The image was very low on noise so you likely won’t notice the difference here. I reduced noise by 10 just to clean up grain visible when zooming in.

Fix perspective

A bad perspective is one of the most frustrating photography mistakes you can come across especially when you want a photo to be truly straight. Don’t get too upset next time your image is slightly crooked; most times it can be fixed using the geometry tool in Lightroom. Just find the Geometry section in the option carousel and tap on it. Here: Frame your photos better using a tripod

You can use the sliders to straighten up the photo. I also like using the Guided Upright tool. Simply tap on the Guided Upright icon and draw lines following crooked elements both vertically and horizontally. The system will automatically straighten the image accordingly.

Fixed noise Fixed perspective

This photo’s perspective is skewed because of the wide-angle lens. I slightly fixed this by using the distortion slider. I didn’t want to go too far because it would cut essential parts of the image off but the trees are now a little more straight as is the building in the back.

Crop

Sometimes fixing perspective is a little too much. Maybe your photo just needs some trimming. In this case go to the Crop section in Lightroom. Rotate and crop accordingly. Make sure to keep composition in mind as cropping an image too little or too much can leave it worse. Our best Lightroom tip would be never to be scared of cropping! More: Learn about composition to improve your photos

Fixed perspective Fixed crop

The grass area was overpowering. It takes attention from the London Eye and the building next to it. I cropped a large part of it to better focus on the subject while also keeping the beautiful greenery visible.

Remove unwanted objects

Sometimes you take a fantastic photo only to find out later you also captured an annoying piece of trash next to your subject. This also happens when shooting random objects which can have dust dirt lint and other annoying distractions. Maybe you don’t want a portrait to show your friend’s latest pimple. Thankfully Adobe’s software is genius and it can help you get rid of imperfections. Also: Consider getting some of your favorite smartphone photography accessories

Select the Healing option to clean your image up. Tap and drag up/down on the icons to the left to select your healing brush’s size feather and opacity. Tap on the imperfection and make sure your brush covers it completely. Alternatively you can tap hold and drag to cover more area. The app is smart enough to pick the right area of the image to heal from but you can drag the selections around if it gets things wrong.

Fixed crop Removed unwanted objects

There aren’t many elements I would like to remove from this image. I got rid of a few heads and far away people on the left side of the image under the building just to show you what the tool can do.

Selective edits and effects

Selective edits can help you customize specific areas within your image. This tool is useful when a section of your photo is overexposed or maybe you just want to make something darker to bring more attention to your subject. These are a couple of examples but you can selectively alter many things such as color white balance sharpness noise etc.

Tap on the Selective section in the Lightroom app press the “+” button and pick which kind of selection you want. The brush will let you manually select areas within a photo as you wish. You can also use oval selective edits and gradients. The latter can be used to fade effects through an image smoothly.

After selecting the area you want to customize just start editing as you wish using the buttons below. You will find Light Color Effects Detail and Optics options.

Removed unwanted objects Final image

Used the gradient tool to darken the area on the left side of the sky. Made it darker to pull more cloud details and make the sky bits bluer. Next: Here are some photography essentials we recommend

Original photo vs final edit A great photographer is good at both shooting and editing. There is much more you need to learn about editing but these Lightroom tips are sure to help you greatly enhance your image quality.

Lastly here is a comparison between the original image and the final edit with all Lightroom tips applied.

FAQs Q: How do I blur the background in Lightroom?

A: Smartphone cameras and basic lenses make it very hard to achieve a bokeh effect but you can recreate it through editing. It won’t look the same but at least it’s possible. Just Go to Masking and tap on the + button. You can either use the Select Subject or Select Sky functions. If those don’t apply to your needs you can also use the Brush function to select what you want to blur. Once you make your selections go ahead and tap on Effects and reduce Texture. You can also go to Detail and reduce Sharpness. This will essentially bur out the selected sections.

Q: How do I add a watermark in Lightroom?

A: Lightroom used to be pretty bad at watermarking but the feature has been dramatically improved. The process is simple and streamlined right into the exporting process. When you’re done editing a photo tap on the Share button in the top-right corner. Pick Export as toggle on Include Watermark hit Customize and select whether you want to use Text or Graphic as a watermark. Make your selections and hit Back. Tap the checkmark to export the image with the watermark.

Q: How do I whiten teeth in Lightroom?

A: This is a common edit people want to do but we didn’t have any humans featured in our sample image. Here’s how to do it though. While editing the picture tap on Masking hit the + button select Brush and highlight the teeth. When done just go to Color. From here you’ll have to use common sense to get the teeth whitened. Usually teeth are yellow so simply edit the Temperature by moving the slider towards the bluer side. Additionally you can reduce the Saturation. Tap the checkmark when done.

Q: How do I smooth skin in Lightroom?

A: Skin is another ordinary edit people want to do especially in close-ups. To do this tap on Masking hit the + button select Brush and highlight the skin you want to smooth. Go to Effects and reduce the Texture. Additionally you can go to Detail increase the Noise tool and/or minimize Sharpness. Tap the checkmark when done. Adobe Lightroom is one of our favorite photo editors but we know there are other alternatives you might prefer. We have a list of the best Android photo editors if you need help finding an option. We happen to like Snapseed as it offers most of these features for free. Additionally you might want to up your game with one of the best camera phones or DSLRs.

To add text to a circle or any path in Illustrator draw a circle choose the Path Text Tool click the circle and type. The tricky part comes when you want to add two phrases and have one right side up at the top of the circle and one right side up at the bottom of the circle. Here's how:

Press and hold the Shift key and draw a circle with the Ellipse tool. It doesn't matter what color the stroke or fill is because they both disappear when you click with the text tool. To draw a perfect circle outwards from the center press Option+Shift on a Mac or Alt+Shift on Windows.

Select the Text tool drop-down menu and choose the Type on a Path Tool.

Open the Type panel and select Paragraph (Window > Type > Paragraph). Alternatively click the Align Center button in the Panel Options. This step sets the justification to center.

Click the top center of the circle. A flashing input cursor appears. When you enter the text it's center-aligned as you type.

With the Type panel open ​click the Character tab. Choose a font and size then enter the text for the top of the circle. The text runs along the top of the circle. The stroke on the shape is used as the baseline for the text.

Switch to the Direct Selection tool click once on the circle then copy it to the clipboard. To paste the object in front of the current object select Edit > Paste in Front. It will look the same (except the text appears heavier because the new one is pasted on top of the original). To make things simple open the Layers panel and rename one of the layers to indicate it's the front copy.

Before flipping the text open the Layers panel and turn off the visibility of the bottom layer. Switch to the Type Tool select the text and enter the new text.

Select Type > Type on a Path > Type on a Path Options to open the Path Options dialog box. Choose Rainbow for the Effect and for Align to Path choose Ascender. The Ascender is the highest part of the lettering and places the text outside the circle.

Check the Flip box then check Preview so you can see how it will look. Spacing can also be adjusted here. Click OK. The Rainbow option doesn't distort the text.

Click away from the text to deselect it and choose the Selection Tool in the toolbox. You'll see a handle at the top of the shape and two handles at the bottom. The top handle moves the text along the path as you drag it but depending on how you drag the handle the text may move inside the circle. If you roll the cursor over this handle it switches to a Rotate cursor. The two handles at the bottom are the ones you should use. These handles rotate the object instead of moving the text. When finished turn on the visibility of the hidden layer.",,,,,,,,,

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.

Semiconductor firms Intel Corporation Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) and NVIDIA Corporation have reportedly suspended chip sales to the Russian Federation in the wake of the ongoing crisis in Europe according to a report from the Russian publication RBC. The report quotes two sources in the Russian information technology industry to claim that representatives of Intel and AMD have informed Russian manufacturers that their products are not temporarily being shipped to Russia.

This report follows the United States Department of Commerce's decision earlier this week to broadly expand the scope of its entity list to add Russia and Russian entities. The Entity List is the Commerce Department's tool for sanctioning governments and firms that have been deemed as acting contrary to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.

Intel & AMD Reviewing Impact Of U.S Sanctions Against Russia On Their Sales Believes Report

According to the RBC Intel and AMD representatives have verbally informed Russian firms that supplies of their products to Russia have been stopped. The publication reports that the two companies have suspended shipments and it goes on to add that Intel's office in China has also reached out to companies in the country to inform them to not ship to Russia.

So far this is the only report that has surfaced for the two semiconductor companies and it is yet to be confirmed by either them or any other publication. The RBC also quotes a representative of the Association of Russian Developers and Electronics Manufacturers (ARPE) to confirm its report that Intel and AMD have suspended their Russian shipments.

An Intel spokesperson reached by the publication only replied that their company was complying with all sanctions imposed by the Commerce Department. Representatives from AMD and Russia's trade ministry did not respond to RBC's requests for comment.

The effect of the sanctions on the Russian consumer electronics market is unclear. In its updates to the Entity List the Commerce Department restricts sales of American origin products or products with an American origin technology in them to the Russian government and state-affiliated entities along with others such as the Russian military.

These changes set to make their way to the Federal Register of the United States to amend Title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Subtitle B of this title regulates foreign trade and the latest amendments announced this week will add Russia with Cuba as a country sanctioned by the U.S government.

As concerning the effects on the consumer electronics sector Section 740.19 of Subchapter C of Chapter VII of Subtitle B deals with exempted items that can be exported or reexported to the sanctioned countries. The current version of this rule only applies to Cuba but an amendment will expand its scope to include Russia as well.

Part (b) of this section reads as follows:

Eligible commodities and software. Commodities and software in paragraphs (b)(1) through (17) of this section are eligible for export or reexport under this section to Cuba. Commodities in paragraph (b)(18) of this section are eligible for export or reexport under this section to Sudan only. (1) Consumer computers designated EAR99 or classified under Export Control Classification Numbers (ECCN) 5A992.c or 4A994.b; (2) Consumer disk drives and solid state storage equipment classified under ECCN 5A992 or designated EAR99; (3) Input/output control units (other than industrial controllers designed for chemical processing) designated EAR99; (4) Graphics accelerators and graphics coprocessors designated EAR99; (5) Monitors classified under ECCN 5A992.c or designated EAR99; (6) Printers classified under ECCN 5A992.c or designated EAR99; (7) Modems classified under ECCNs 5A991.b.2 5A991.b.4. or 5A992.c or designated EAR99; (8) Network access controllers and communications channel controllers classified under ECCN 5A991.b.4 or designated EAR99; (9) Keyboards mice and similar devices designated EAR99; (10) Mobile phones including cellular and satellite telephones personal digital assistants and subscriber information module (SIM) cards and similar devices classified under ECCNs 5A992.c or 5A991 or designated EAR99; (11) Memory devices classified under ECCN 5A992.c or designated EAR99; (12) Consumer “information security” equipment “software” (except “encryption source code”) and peripherals classified under ECCNs 5A992.c or 5D992.c or designated EAR99; (13) Digital cameras and memory cards classified under ECCN 5A992 or designated EAR99; (14) Television and radio receivers classified under ECCN 5A992 or designated EAR99; (15) Recording devices classified under ECCN 5A992 or designated EAR99; (16) Batteries chargers carrying cases and accessories for the equipment described in this paragraph that are designated EAR99; (17) Consumer “software” (except “encryption source code”) classified under ECCNs 4D994 5D991 or 5D992.c or designated EAR99 to be used for equipment described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(16) of this section; and

The Commerce Department's definition of a 'consumer'.

Additionally since the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) also uses U.S.-origin equipment to manufacture semiconductors it appears that TSMC might also stop supplying to Russia. However this is far from clear at this point and the only news that has made it out so far on the matter is from another Russian publication CNews which cites the Kommersant as its source.

According to a translation of this report:

TSMC warned Russian processor developers about the very likely termination of cooperation with them. This means that they will no longer be able to produce their products at the factories of this Taiwanese company Kommersant writes.

As CNews reached out to three Russian companies believed to be TSMC's customers one denied that TSMC had reached out to it while the others refused to comment.

At this point it's important to note that the new rules proposed by Commerce exempt countries which have announced sanctions against Russia. This list of ""partner countries"" does not include Taiwan likely due to its geopolitical status.

Only a small (single-digit) percentage of TSMC's sales are made to Russian companies and entities and the island nation announced that it will join the international community in sanctioning Russia. Additionally an anonymous source quoted by The Washington Post believes that TSMC has suspended Russian chip shipments and TSMC has announced that it is ""committed"" to complying with the latest sanctions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9qYXNvbi1tb21vYS1saXNhLWJvbmV0LXJlcG9ydGVkbHktMTQ0MjQ3Nzg1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jason Momoa & Lisa Bonet Are Reportedly Giving Their Marriage Another Chance,"When 2022 started we got the heartbreaking news that one of our favorite celebrity couples was splitting up.

The group of veteran past “SNL” hosts hazed Mulaney before handing him a coveted royal blue smoking jacket with a large numeral 5 embrodered on the right breast.

More from Variety

The sketch opened with Martin Rudd and Bergen meeting in a private library-like setting all wearing their jackets. As Mulaney entered the room Bergen quips “Let me be the first person to say ‘Who are you?’ ” To which Mulaney responded “If you have a niece or son who’s bad at sports he might know who I am.”

Fey pointed to Mulaney’s tenure as a writer on “SNL” alongside another famous alumnus Bill Hader. “You wrote that character with Bill Hader and 800 other things that aged terribly” she chided.

The group made note that Rudd joined the elite list last December when production of the episode was abruptly shortened by the omicron surge forcing Rudd to deliver his monologue to an empty Studio 8H. “I’m just happy you’re here in my episode” Mulaney joked.

Bergen then turned serious. “We have some buisness to discuss: The club here has gotten so big that to get in someone has to retire” the former “Murphy Brown” star stated.

Martin the comedy legend now riding high as a star of Hulu’s “Only Murders in the Building” shot back “Too bad no one here is retirement age.” Mulaney observed “You are 76.”

O’Brien who ended his 28-year run in late-night last June then burst into the room albeit without his blue jacket.

“I’m just here to sign up for Peacock” he said referring to NBC’s streaming platform. “It’s weird that they make you do it in person.”

O’Brien flubbed his next line winked at the audience and became characteristically animated. After playfully yelling “so shut up” at Fey he lamented “I hosted my own TV show for decades.”

Mulaney queried “What are you doing now?” A dejected O’Brien replied “I have a podcast.”

But O’Brien brightened up and triumphantly declared “Live from New York…” The other five-timers reminded O’Brien that the “SNL” episode had already had its traditional cold open but the “Late Night” and “Conan” host pressed on. “Live from New York it’s Saturday Night” he shouted.

The sketch ended with an overhead shot of the august group shaking hands and exchanging greetings.

While many believe he’s on his way to being the most sought-after coach in college football could the NFL be an option for Sanders?

In an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon Sanders sent a message to the Cowboys. Additionally the Jackson State coach shot-down the possibility of coaching in the NFL.

“I love Jerry Jones. I love the Cowboys. But I cannot coach pros” stated Sanders. “I have a problem with a professional athlete not doing his job and he’s getting handsomely paid. I don’t have any toleration for that. There’s some out there working their butts off but there’s plenty out there that just don’t get it.

“And I would fight. I would fight everyday as a coach. I couldn’t do it. I’m old school. I’m old school man. You know we made it this far from your work ethic. Yeah it would be tough.”

Evidently Deion Sanders believes his coaching style works better in college than it would in the NFL. Still that won’t stop franchises from calling if the former Cowboys star can keep impressing at the collegiate level.

Sanders on ‘Primetime’ nickname: ‘You got to earn a nickname.’

Furthermore Sanders also revealed how the legendary nickname of “Primetime” got started. First Jimmy Fallon jokingly asked Sanders about a previous nickname.

“You don’t like Neon Deon?” Fallon asked with a grin.

Then the former NFL star cornerback and current head coach of Jacksonville State wasted no time. Sanders explained his preference when it comes to nicknames as well as the reasoning behind the moniker.

“No” responded Sanders with a laugh. “They tried to give me that at Florida State and I had already earned ‘Primetime’ in high school.

“I dropped like 37 that night and had two dunks back-to-back the curl was wet and it looked dry. We were on the way home on the bus and one of my homies says ‘Man you are primetime!’ I said ‘You are right.’ You can’t just give me a nickname — you got to earn a nickname. I don’t like Neon Deion.”

Ironically it turns out one of the greatest NFL players in history actually earned his prized nickname on the basketball court. Nevertheless Deion Sanders more than earned his flashy nickname throughout his life.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Researchers in the US have performed real-time observations in 'realistic indoor conditions' that mimic the work of indoor professional cleaners.

Commercial cleaners for sanitising indoor surfaces may deposit small pollutant particles into human respiratory tracts at rates equal to or higher than aerosols from vehicles they found.

The new findings may have implications for people who have worked heavily with disinfectant sprays during the Covid pandemic.

Some staff have been spending entire working days frequently dousing touch-point surfaces in offices to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

The new findings published in Science Advances may have implications for people who have worked with disinfectant sprays during the Covid pandemic (stock image)

HOUSEHOLD AEROSOLS RELEASE MORE HARMFUL SMOG CHEMICALS THAN UK CARS Household aerosols now release more harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs) than all vehicles in the UK a 2021 study found. In 2017 the UK population emitted around 60000 tonnes of VOCs from aerosols but only around 30000 tonnes from UK cars running gasoline. But even accounting for all forms of road transport in the country – not just cars but motorbikes vans lorries and buses – aerosols still emit more VOCs the authors said. Read more: Household aerosols release more harmful smog chemicals than UK cars Advertisement !- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/mx/sciencetech/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - ->

The study has been led by Colleen Rosales an environmental scientist at University of California Davis and published today in Science Advances.

'One perturbation that humans introduce to the indoor environment is the use of household cleaning and disinfection products some of which have “natural” scents such as citrus or pine' Rosales and colleagues say in the paper.

'Workplace and residential exposures resulting in adverse health effects are likely to be influenced by increased chemical disinfection of indoor surfaces during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.'

Scientists have known that cleaning indoor surfaces with disinfectants can generate secondary indoor pollutants as gases and aerosols.

But there have been few studies capturing secondary organic aerosol formation in realistic indoor conditions.

A secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is a molecule produced via oxidation over several generations of a parent organic molecule.

'SOA accounts for a major fraction of the global atmospheric aerosol burden' said Professor Annele Virtanen an atmospheric scientist at University of Eastern Finland who was not involved in the study.

'Understanding the mechanism of formation and the properties of SOA is therefore important to estimate its effects on climate air quality and human health.'

Road transport is an source of both greenhouse gases and air pollutants being responsible for significant contributions to emissions of carbon dioxide nitrogen oxides and tiny particulate matter

WHAT ARE VOCs? Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted as gases from certain solids or liquids. VOCs include a variety of chemicals some of which may have short- and long-term adverse health effects. Concentrations of many VOCs are up to ten times higher indoors than outdoors. VOCs are emitted by a wide array of products numbering in the thousands. Sources of VOCs in the home include aerosol sprays cleansers and disinfectants moth repellents air fresheners and automotive products. Other sources include building materials and furnishings office equipment such as copiers and printers permanent markers correction fluids carbonless copy paper and craft materials including glues and adhesives.

To learn more about SOA formation indoors the US team focused on monoterpenes a class of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

Monoterpenes are released from a very wide range of sources including cooking foodstuffs plants and multiple kinds of fragranced products.

In an indoor setting monoterpenes can mix with ozone to form particles that may bury inside the lungs.

The team used a commercial monoterpene-based household cleaner to mop surfaces inside an enclosed mechanically ventilated test room within a research building in a forested area for 12 to 14 minutes.

As the floor was mopped the researchers measured gas-phase precursors oxidants radicals secondary oxidation products and aerosols in real time.

They calculated that a person using a monoterpene-based cleaning product would first inhale about 30 to 40 micrograms of primary volatile organic compound per minute as they begin mopping.

As secondary organic aerosols form when the product interacts with the air in the room the person would then inhale about 0.1 to 0.7 micrograms of these particles per minute.

The authors suggest that maintaining indoor background ozone levels below 1 part per billion before mopping could minimise the buildup of pollutant particles.

As the floor was mopped the researchers measured gas-phase precursors oxidants radicals secondary oxidation products and aerosols in real time. In these graphs gray shading corresponds to active periods of mopping and wiping during the cleaning events

VOCs that are currently being used in aerosols are less damaging than the ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) they replaced in the 1980s.

CFCs which are classified as halocarbons damage Earth's protective ozone layer that shields us from harmful ultraviolet rays generated from the Sun.

""We have traveled to all 50 states and we've stayed in Airbnbs and we just liked the idea"" Randy said. ""I mean compared to staying in a hotel it's just so much nicer to stay.""

Airbnb which launched in 2008 allows homeowners to rent out their property or rooms to travelers for short term stays.

The Baileys used to live in Canton but when the city limited the ability to operate short-term rentals in 2018 the couple who always wanted to become hosts decided to leave their home in Market Heights for a place in Plain Township where no such restriction exists.

From the Statehouse:Legislation would protect that Airbnb in your neighborhood from local bans

The couple both in their 50s have operated their own Airbnb rental out of a suite attached to their Avondale home for the last three years. They said with all the development coming to the central Stark County area the Pro Football Hall of Fame and other city investments local governments should be looking to Airbnb as a way to make the region accessible to visitors.

""We just had a couple stay with us for a week in November. He was applying for a position at Aultman Hospital and she works remotely"" DeDe said. ""She traveled with him since she can work from home. [Our Airbnb] allowed them to travel together while he was auditioning for the position. She would not have come to stay with him if they had to stay in a hotel.""

But changes could be coming. Their homeowner's association recently voted on a proposal to limit rentals in the neighborhood though the Baileys say it's unclear how their Airbnb will be affected. Plus Plain Township is in the process of creating new regulations on the short-term rental market in the coming weeks.

“I understand as a homeowner why they would want to put limits on it” DeDe said.

Airbnb Vrbo draw ire from local governments and support from state

There are around 50 Airbnbs currently listed in the Plain Township area on the vacation rental company's website.

In mid-February the Plain Township Board of Trust and the Zoning Commission began work on a proposal to regulate short-term rentals such as those through Airbnb or Vrbo a similar company.

Largely they're looking to require interested parties to obtain a conditional zoning certificate to operate a short-term rental. Some of the proposed ordinances that go along with that requirement are limiting the number of permits an owner can get limiting the total number of permits that will be issued and allowing only one dwelling unit per parcel to be rented.

Other proposals include requiring hosts to submit a form to the township prior to each rental period detailing aspects of the stay setting capacity limits ensuring off-roadway parking for visitors setting noise limits between 11 p.m. and 8 a.m. and prohibiting large special events.

Tom Ferrara Plain Township planning zoning and development director said township rules don't currently address short-term rentals and with more residents reaching out to inquire about getting involved in the market as well as complaints from some residents about rentals the Board of Trustees figured it was worth getting something on the books.

""Many times when the short-term rentals come in they have large parties wedding parties or whatever it really disrupts the neighborhood"" Ferrara said. ""And let's face it we spend a lot of money to find a home in a place we can relax and enjoy ourselves and sometimes when those large parties are happening every weekend every other weekend it's hard to do.""

But a recently introduced state bill has the potential to stymie the township's efforts. House Bill 563 backed by more than two dozen Republican legislators would block municipalities from prohibiting short-term rentals and limits the type of regulations that local governments could put on the rentals effectively requiring that short-term rentals be treated no differently than a regular residence.

""What I keep saying is that these Vrbos and Airbnbs must have a strong lobby somewhere because this legislation is essentially handcuffing us and our ability to do much of anything with them at this point as introduced"" Plain Township Law Director Eric Williams said during a trustees meeting Tuesday night.

H.B. 563 is only a first draft and Plain trustees said during the meeting that they are keeping a close eye on what it could mean for their own attempts to regulate the rentals.

Rachel DeLevie-Orey Midwest public policy manager at Airbnb said the company supports the proposed legislation.

""We support the bill being considered by the State of Ohio because it ensures that Ohioans will continue to have the ability to earn meaningful income through the short-term rental of their homes while still allowing local municipalities such as Plain Township to pass short-term rental laws that address important considerations such as occupancy and public safety in addition to restrictions that apply to long-term rentals"" she said.

Long-running debate over short-term rentals

Municipalities across the country have been debating for years how to deal with rising numbers of short-term rentals as Airbnb and similar companies like Vrbo have seen their popularity skyrocket in the last decade.

But their growth has led to some concern – an analysis from the Economic Policy Institute concluded that the costs of short-term rental companies' presence in a municipality outweighs any tourism benefits they may bring in.

In particular the report said that Airbnb's presence can inflate the cost of local housing decrease the net tax revenue a municipality would otherwise generate from traditional forms of lodging and disproportionately benefits white wealthy households who are more likely to own non-primary residences that can be rented out.

The Baileys said they are supportive of regulations and see ideas like a bed tax as a way for the region to benefit along with operators.

""[City bans] are cutting off their nose to spite themselves"" Randy said. ""Put a bed tax in. You're turning away revenue. You're turning away people that are willing to share the good things about the city and their home with guests.""

The rules limit short term rentals which include Airbnbs and VRBOs to being within a host's primary residence not in a separate unit. The exception is if the host's home is a seasonal home as identified by the Burlington assessor. A host may rent out a seasonal home when they are not present.

Here's three things to know about the discussion around short term rentals.

Rentals hard to come by for Chittenden County residents

Burlington's vacancy rate the rate of homes available to rent long-term has always hovered around 1% to 2% according to the memo presented to the council by the Office of City planning.

In October Chittenden County Regional Planning Commission reported that the vacancy rate for the county had dropped to 0.9% the lowest it had been in 10 years.

A healthy vacancy rate is 5% according to the Chittenden County Regional Planning Commission. Some officials and residents worry that short term rentals are exacerbating the housing shortage.

How many short term rentals in Burlington?

As of fall 2021 there were 246 short term rentals in Burlington according to the memo. This number was lower than the previous year's count of 357.

The percentage of stand-alone units versus bedrooms inside host's homes also changed. In 2019 67% of short term rentals were stand-alone units while 33% were rooms within a host's home. In 2021 this had shifted to 80% stand-alone units and 20% bedrooms.

The City Council report also notes that 54% of short term rentals are on single-family properties and 45% are on multi-family properties. The other 1% are on an unknown type of property.

Concerns about new rules

Some residents thought the new rules were too strict. Deb Ward Lyons wrote to the council proposing changes including a tax or fee on short term rentals that would go to the Housing Trust Fund; allowing short term rentals in accessory dwelling units duplexes and small apartment buildings where the host also lives; and requiring short term rentals to be owned for three years before being allowed to rent to stop speculative buying.

Julie Marks founder and director of Vermont Short Term Rental Alliance Inc. wrote in her letter to the council that she thinks the ordinance passed is bad for homeowners tenants and business and recommended the city gather more data about the impacts of short term rentals before passing strict rules.

Will the city be successful this time?,"After several unsuccessful pushes to tighten the rules governing short-term rentals Bethlehem is looking to crack down on Airbnbs and an ongoing series of zoning hearings will determine the city’s legal ability to do so.

Two Bethlehem property owners who rented out homes on Airbnb are at the center of the city’s ongoing efforts. The owners married couple Mary Ellen Williams and Jay Brew are appealing a citation the city issued against them last summer for renting out a home on Airbnb in the city’s historic district.

The city’s efforts to regulate short-term rentals have stemmed from neighbor complaints who say that Airbnbs bring unruly guests into their quiet neighborhood. But Williams and Brew say that the city’s rules for Airbnbs are unclear and inconsistent and they are frustrated with the five-year saga.

If the board rules in the city’s favor Bethlehem will have greater leeway to enforce Airbnb regulations even though council failed to pass Airbnb regulations in 2020. Either side could also appeal the ruling to the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas.

The next zoning hearing on the case is March 9.

The city vs. Airbnbs

Conflict between the Airbnb owners and the city began in 2017 when city council passed an ordinance regulating Airbnbs in Bethlehem in response to complaints from residents.

The ordinance required property owners to live on the property they rent out limited them to renting out up to two bedrooms for up to 30 days and outlined inspection and licensing requirements for owners. Council passed the order after numerous complaints from neighbors in the historic district who disliked Airbnbs in their neighborhood.

Though Brew and Williams are not the only Airbnb renters in Bethlehem their properties in the historic district prompted backlash from neighbors who called on city hall to better regulate short-term rentals.

Brew and Williams previously operated four Airbnb properties in Bethlehem. Their website calls the rentals “Lehigh Valley’s only 5-star accommodations.” One of them dubbed the “Christmas City mansion” at 4 W. Church St. rents out seven suites and features a Victorian-style dining room with a crystal chandelier and a surround-style movie theater according to the company’s website.

Brew and Williams sued the city over the ordinance. A Northampton County judge initially ruled in Brew and William’s favor and said the city needed to address Airbnbs via an amendment to the city’s zoning ordinance not a standalone law.

But a 2019 state Supreme Court ruling determined that municipalities can in fact ban short-term housing in single-family zoning districts entirely. The decision gave Bethlehem the green light to cite Airbnb owners that the city sees as violating the zoning ordinance — which it did in Brew and Williams’ case.

The zoning board hearings

Bethlehem issued Williams and Brew a violation notice on July 15 2021. In it the city says that the owners are violating the city’s zoning ordinance because the short-term rental use is “not authorized generally and/or fails to qualify as any number of specific uses” allowed in the city’s historic district.

Bethlehem has ordered a Airbnb shutdown for the Chandler House owned by Jay Brew and Mary Ellen Williams. The city says the Airbnb house rental violates zoning for that historic neighborhood.

Out of their four Airbnb properties only the Lofts on Main are still in operation as of January according to Brew. He said the city has “kicked the can down the road” on regulating Airbnbs for the past five years and that the rules for renting out an Airbnb have never been clear.

“After four years we don’t know what the regulations are. It’s sort of a problem. We’ve been kicking this down the line” Brew said. “The city hasn’t come to the ability to say yes or no.”

The city’s zoning ordinance outlines where “bed and breakfasts” are allowed to exist in the city but defines them as properties where the owners live on site. Brew and Williams do not live in the properties they rent out although they did live in the historic district. Brew believes the city needs to more explicitly outline where short-term rentals are allowed in the city.

Deputy director of community and economic development Alicia Miller Karner said that the city wants to allow short-term lodging in largely commercial or industrial district and only under special circumstances in high density residential areas. But city council failed to pass Airbnb regulations via a zoning ordinance last year that would have clarified the city’s position with some council members fearing the changes are too restrictive.

“I think this goes too far and I think it punishes people who are doing a good job of renting out their homes” said former Council President Adam Waldron at the time. “They are encouraging people to come to Bethlehem and spend their money and visit our downtown.”

Ultimately it will come down to the zoning hearing board to decide whether the city is justified in citing Brew and Williams. They face a $500 fine if their appeal fails.

Unhappy neighbors

Some Bethlehem neighbors disagree with Waldron.

Bruce Haines a managing partner at Hotel Bethlehem and resident of the city’s historic district sees a host of reasons to oppose Airbnbs. Unvetted guests partying late into the night. Commercial intrusion into their quiet neighborhood. Neighbors replaced with temporary guests. It hurts business at the hotel on Main Street too.

Haines agrees with Brew on one thing: the city has not done enough to address the problem.

“In our minds the prior administration of the city has not been diligent in pursuing this to conclusion and it’s dragged on for four years without any resolution and [the Airbnb] continues to operate” Haines said. “So it’s very disappointing to all of us that this has dragged on and on and on.”

Haines said Bethlehem should allow Airbnbs only in the city’s commercial districts like Main Street essentially treating them as hotels subject to the same regulations.

That’s why Haines has legally intervened in the zoning hearings and hired lawyer Andrew Schantz of Allentown firm Davison & McCarthy to represent him. Schantz declined to comment for this story.

Haines is acting as a third party in the hearings via an intervention process because he lives in the historic district and therefore has standing to participate.

As for the property owners even though they’re continuing their appeal they’ve decided back-and-forth between the city and angry neighbors is more trouble than it’s worth. The ordeal has taken an emotional toll Brew said — they moved out of Bethlehem to Bath in early January and sold most of their Airbnb properties.

“We’re sick of it” Brew said.

Damon hosts this very unique Caboose 103 in Eureka Springs right across the Missouri border. Here's how he describes it on the Airbnb listing:

This Caboose Cabin is set up on the rails just as it was when it was rolling across the American countryside. You will find the Caboose furnished with a Full/Double Bed Kitchenette (coffee maker microwave and small refrigerator). Outside you will be able to relax on the spacious deck. The deck is shaded and secluded. Wooded views surround the Caboose providing privacy and creating an intimate setting.

This caboose/Airbnb has a lot going for it. It's just south of Branson and the Missouri Ozarks with an asking price of only $123 per night. Considering that my family paid that much for a not-very-great motel last year that didn't have a working toilet that's a bargain in my book.

Viewers have added their theories as the post climbs over 90000 views.

In the original video user Emma (@emmachiaro4) details how she booked an Airbnb for a birthday trip five months in advance. She shows the screenshot of the alleged house a woodsy tiny home located outside of Portland Oregon.

Just this week she allegedly got a message from the owner claiming a guest recovering from black mold needed to extend their stay in the Airbnb. In a screenshot of the conversation the owner says the guest would refund Emma and pay her an extra $100 through Venmo.

The offer has led to confusion. As they had just passed the deadline for the 30 day cancellation window Emma isn’t sure if she’d get a full refund and she says the owner is refusing to cancel on his end. She says that Airbnb told her the owner’s excuse was “not a valid reason for cancelation” and the company would remind him of the penalties for doing something like this.

The owner continued to send her messages about canceling her stay and Emma said he tried to “guilt us into giving up our reservation.” The bottom of the message thread indicates that the guest canceled the reservation herself.

Emma said the last minute change resulted in far more expensive options on Airbnb and she questioned whether she had been duped. Users have weighed in on whether they think this is an Airbnb scam or a mistake.

@mountain_mamas commented “he’s double booked and created a story so his reviews wouldn’t be impacted. I bet that same listing is on vrbo or something.”

@shaquille.oatmeal..1 said “The message said the woman wanted to refund your money plus $100. Did I read that right? I think he just wanted to avoid the bad review.”

@astra8989 added “Girl absolutely not. At best you spend a lot more $ to book elsewhere. At worst he scams you out of your refund. HE can cancel it and SHE can pay him.”

@lyndseydrews commented “go through with the trip there and don’t let him cancel.. if she needs 4-6 weeks to recover and it’s in a month still that’s 4 weeks so no excuse.”

The Daily Dot reached out to Airbnb for comment and contacted @emmachiaro4 via Instagram direct message.

Update 4:00 pm CT Feb. 27: In a statement to the Daily Dot Emma said she made the video to help others.

“I felt like this was a suspicious interaction to have with an Airbnb host so I wanted to warn others” she said. She was able to get a refund but was frustrated “that the host broke rules and Airbnb had no solution for that.”

“We are glad that this guest was able to rebook a new reservation. Our team has been in contact with this guest to offer support and reached out to the Host to educate them on how to properly cancel future reservations” said a spokesperson from Airbnb.

Correspondent

ASHWAUBENON – The Notre Dame Academy boy’s hockey team has arguably been the best in Northeast Wisconsin for the past three years.

No. 1-seeded Notre Dame left no doubt in defeating No. 2 Neenah/Hortonville/Menasha 7-2 in a Division 1 Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association sectional final game Feb. 25 at the Cornerstone Community Ice Center.

With the victory the Tritons qualified for the state tournament Mar. 3-5 at the Alliant Energy Center in Madison.

“It’s a game plan where you want to start fast” Notre Dame Head Coach Cory McCracken said. “We established ourselves by getting behind their defense and we got bodies around their goalie to make it difficult for him to see pucks. We had lots of guys who won’t show up on the tally sheet who did a great job for us on the ice tonight.”

The Tritons joined Hudson and Madison Edgewood as state qualifiers thus far.

The remaining sectional final between Brookfield East co-op and University School Milwaukee will be played Saturday Feb. 26 to determine the fourth and final spot in the field.

Depending on seeding – which will take place Sunday – Notre Dame will play in the state tournament Friday March 4 at either 10 a.m. or 12:15 p.m.

“We are going to take it one game at a time” McCracken said. “I think we’re in a solid position to be a No. 2 seed. Either way we’ll be ready for the opponent that’s handed to us.”

The Tritons will try and better their runner-up finish in 2020 and semifinal appearance in 2021.

The matchup against Neenah featured the same number of goals as the first meeting – a 5-4 Neenah win – but the difference was the Tritons jumped on the Rockets from the get-go.

With the fans barely settled into their seats Hunter Bill sent in a wrister from the blue line that found the back of the net to give Notre Dame a 1-0 lead.

“We started hot by putting lots of pucks on the net” Bill said. “We wanted it bad.”

The madness didn’t end there.

Joe Gerbitz scored about 40 seconds later as the Tritons opened up a two-goal lead.

Midway through the first period NHM’s goalie Jaeden Hannus gave up another goal when Keegan McCarron redirected a shot by Notre Dame’s Michael McIntee for a 3-0 lead with 10 minutes remaining in the first period.

The physicality of the game was evident as numerous whistles stopped play for goalie interference or the net coming off its moorings.

In the final seconds of the opener after each team exchanged goals the Rockets had a breakaway goal disallowed after the lead official determined the horn had sounded before the puck crossed the goal line.

“We have lots of skill on this team” McCracken said. “However sometimes we use it in the wrong way. We got casual with the puck and that’s part of the growing-up process for some of these kids. It would have been a momentum changer but I think our guys responded well going into the middle period.”

With a 4-1 lead heading into the second period the Tritons tacked on goals by Callan Budinger and McCarron to take a 6-1 lead with still more than half the game left to be played.

Later after a breakaway attempt by NHM was thwarted by a Notre Dame penalty the Rockets were awarded a penalty shot.

As NHM’s Matthew Hasler danced around the left side of the net Tritons goalie Lleyton Jaschke made a pad save at the last moment to preserve the five-goal cushion.

“When the lights are bright you want your best players to come out and make saves” McCracken said. “(Jaschke) did that tonight and in Detroit a few weeks back. It’s not by accident – he’s good.”

Neenah’s Aidan Paschke and Notre Dame’s Bill rounded out the scoring.

“We have a young group of guys so we want to make sure we recover” Bill said. “We have to get into the right mindset going to Madison. Our seniors have brought great leadership to this program. We’ve come a long way since the beginning of the season.”

Workers in the departments of Corrections Health Services and Veteran’s Affairs and those working in congregate facilities such as prisons will be required to wear masks until at least April 1 according to updated guidance issued Friday by the state Division of Personnel Management. Quarantine rules for those who test positive for COVID-19 are not changing.

While the Department of Corrections will continue requiring masks until at least April the department announced Friday the recent drop in COVID-19 cases prompted it to resume in-person visitation for inmates.

Dane County on Feb. 14 announced that its indoor mask mandate would be allowed to expire at the end of this month while the Madison School District on Wednesday said its requirement would remain until at least the end of spring break or April 1 but that beginning Tuesday students and staff could go unmasked outdoors on school property. The majority of other school districts in Dane County will loosen or drop their requirements entirely as of Tuesday.

UW-Madison announced on Feb. 16 that it will lift its mask mandate when spring break starts March 12.

The seven-day average for positive COVID-19 tests in Dane County has dropped from as high as 22% in early January to less than 5% as of Thursday according to Public Health Madison and Dane County. Hospitalizations due to the virus are also down 19% over the last two weeks while nearly 80% of residents have been vaccinated and more than 69% of those older than 12 have had their boosters.

In guidance updated Friday the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention leaves the decision on whether to wear a mask in Dane County up to “your personal preference informed by your personal level of risk.” Under a new three-tier risk-rating system which the agency calls Covid-19 Community Levels Dane is considered low risk the least dangerous. The system is based on hospital bed use and admissions and number of new COVID-19 cases in an area.

It’s a significant shift from the CDC’s previous mask guidance issued Jan. 21. Under that guidance and its method for calculating risk Dane County was deemed to be at a high level of risk as late as early Friday afternoon and masks indoors were recommended.

In announcing the partial end of the state buildings mask mandate the Division of Personnel Management noted that positive COVID-19 tests and test rates are at levels not seen since last summer and that more than “77% of Wisconsin state employees have completed their COVID-19 vaccination series.”

State quarantine rules will continue to require that anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 stay home for five days. They can return to work after that if they are symptom-free but must wear masks around others for an additional five days.",,,,,,,,,
ALL,Allstate,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vZGVjaWRlci5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8yNi9uby1leGl0LWRlbm5pcy1oYXlzYmVydC1hbGxzdGF0ZS1ndXktZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hulu's 'No Exit' Proves Dennis Haysbert Is A Lot More Than Just The Guy From Allstate,"If you had access to television between the years 2003 and 2015 then you’re surely familiar with the many Allstate commercials featuring a stoic-looking gentleman in a crisp suit who would solemnly address the camera asking in a deep soothing voice “Are you in good hands?”

That voice belongs to actor Dennis Haysbert and while many still know him as “the Allstate guy” Haysbert’s acting career spans four decades and he’s been consistently hitting it out of the park. Take for example his most recent film No Exit a thriller that was released on Hulu on Friday. Based on the 2017 novel of the same name by Taylor Adams No Exit follows a young woman named Darby (played by actor Havana Rose Liu) who is stranded with four strangers at a rest stop in the mountains in the middle of a blizzard. Then Darby discovers a kidnapped child in one of the vans in the parking lot—and suddenly everyone at that rest stop becomes a suspect.

Haysbert stars as one of those suspects a former Marine named Ed who was on his way to Reno with his wife Sandi (played by the great Dale Dickey) when they got caught in the snowstorm. Or at least that’s what he says.

But though director Damien Power successfully casts suspicion on everyone early on you can’t help but find Haysbert’s presence reassuring. He has an authoritative air of morality that you immediately trust despite his weakness for gambling. Haysbert imbues his character with a quiet sense of right and wrong so that even though we never see anything from Ed’s life outside of this visitor center you can feel the truth of his military backstory.

Despite the severity of the situation Haysbert finds small moments for humor too—like when Ed fed up with one character’s odd behavior snaps to his wife “I’ve known plenty of that guy. Weird little white boys with a chip on their shoulder.” It’s funny because it’s accurate and Haysbert’s exasperated delivery made me laugh out loud.

It’s far from the first time that Haysbert has delivered an exemplary performance over the course of his career and yes I’m including the Allstate commercials in that. After all one does not become a ubiquitous company spokesperson without being very good at one’s job. But No Exit is a good reminder that Haysbert is much more than merely “the Allstate guy” and indeed has been much more than that since before he ever started selling insurance. For example in 1993 Haysbert starred in a bizarre but critically acclaimed art film for the 1994 Cannes Film Festival called Suture in which he played a man who agreed to swap identities with his identical brother. In 2002 he starred as the gardener Raymond Deagan in the period drama Far From Heaven alongside Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid—a role that earned him multiple award nominations for Best Supporting Actor. And 24 fans know Haysbert as David Palmer while Lucifer fans no doubt know him as God.

None of this is to say that commercial acting—and very good commercial acting at that—is not respectable work.

By Foo Yun Chee

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Alphabet Inc and its YouTube unit should ban users pushing war propaganda as part of measures to stop disinformation after Russia's invasion of Ukraine EU industry chief Thierry Breton told the chief executives of the companies on Sunday.

Alphabet's Google on Saturday barred Russia's state-owned media outlet RT and other channels from receiving money for ads on their websites apps and YouTube videos similar to a move by Facebook after the invasion of Ukraine.

In a video call with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki Breton said the companies should go further.

""Freedom of expression does not cover war propaganda. For too long content from Russia Today and other Russian state media has been amplified by algorithms and proposed as 'recommended content' to people who had never requested it"" Breton said in a statement after the video call.

""War propaganda should never be recommended content - what is more it should have no place on online platforms at all. I count on the tech industry to take urgent and effective measures to counter disinformation"" he said.

Breton said the companies' terms and conditions for users should be expanded to include war propaganda giving them the power to kick violators off their platforms.

The commission said there was agreement to adapt and update the platforms' policies in view of the current situation.

European Commission Vice President Vera Jourova also took part in the video call.

""I expect YouTube and Google to step up efforts to address Russian war propaganda. Russia has weaponised information this is why platforms cannot be a space for its war lies"" she said in a statement.

Google said it had already taken unprecedented steps to halt disinformation on Ukraine.

""As we said to the Commissioners our teams continue to monitor the situation around the clock and are ready to take further action"" a Google spokesperson said.

Banning accounts promoting war propaganda could be problematic however because of the difficulty of defining what constitutes propaganda and from whose perspective.

(Reuters) -Alphabet Inc's Google barred on Saturday Russia's state-owned media outlet RT and other channels from receiving money for ads on their websites apps and YouTube videos similar to a move by Facebook after the invasion of Ukraine.

Citing ""extraordinary circumstances"" Google's YouTube unit said it was ""pausing a number of channels’ ability to monetize on YouTube."" These included several Russian channels affiliated with recent sanctions such as those by the European Union.

Ad placement is largely controlled by YouTube.

Google added later that it was also barring Russian state-funded media outlets from using its ad technology to generate revenue on their own websites and apps.

In addition the Russian media will not be able to buy ads through Google Tools or place ads on Google services such as search and Gmail spokesman Michael Aciman said.

""We’re actively monitoring new developments and will take further steps if necessary"" Aciman said.

On Wednesday the European Union unveiled sanctions on individuals such as Margarita Simonyan whom it called RT's editor-in-chief and ""a central figure"" of Russian propaganda.

Videos from affected media will also come up less often in recommendations YouTube spokesperson Farshad Shadloo said. He added that RT and several other channels would no longer be accessible in Ukraine after a Ukrainian government request.

On Saturday Ukraine Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said on Twitter he contacted YouTube ""to block the propagandist Russian channels — such as Russia 24 TASS RIA Novosti.""

RT and Simonyan did not respond to requests for comment. YouTube declined to identify the other channels restricted.

For years lawmakers and some users have urged Google for more action on channels linked to the Russian government concerned that they spread misinformation and should not profit by it.

Russia received an estimated $7 million to $32 million over the two years to December 2018 from ads across 26 YouTube channels it backed digital researcher Omelas told Reuters at the time.

YouTube has previously said it did not treat state-funded media channels that comply with its rules differently from others when it comes to sharing ad revenue.

On Friday Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc barred Russian state media from running ads or generating revenue from ads on its services.

Continuous analysis of customer data determines among other things prices suggested purchases and what profitable own-label products Amazon chooses to produce. The 200 million users who are Amazon Prime members are not only the corporation’s most valuable customers but also their richest source of user data. The more Amazon and services you use – whether it’s the shopping app the Kindle e-reader the Ring doorbell Echo smart speaker or the Prime streaming service – the more their algorithms can infer what kind of person you are and what you are most likely to buy next. The firm’s software is so accomplished at prediction that third parties can hire its algorithms as a service called Amazon Forecast.

Not everyone is happy about this level of surveillance. Those who have requested their data from Amazon are astonished by the vast amounts of information they are sent including audio files from each time they speak to the company’s voice assistant Alexa.

Like its data-grabbing counterparts Google and Facebook Amazon’s practices have come under the scrutiny of regulators. Last year Amazon was hit with a $886.6m (£636m) fine for processing personal data in violation of EU data protection rules which it is appealing against. And a recent Wired investigation showed concerning privacy and security failings at the tech giant.

So what data does Amazon collect and share and what can you do to stop it?

The data Amazon collects according to its privacy policy

Strict EU regulation in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK equivalent the Data Protection Act limit the ways personal data can be used in Europe compared with the US. But according to Amazon’s privacy policy the tech giant still collects a large amount of information. This covers three areas: information you give Amazon data it collects automatically and information from other sources such as delivery data from carriers.

Amazon can collect your name address searches and recordings when you speak to the Alexa voice assistant. It knows your orders content you watch on Prime your contacts if you upload them and communications with it via email. Meanwhile when you use its website cookie trackers are used to “enhance your shopping experience” and improve its services Amazon says.

How often you look up words on the Kindle e-reader might indicate how literate you are in a certain language

Some of the data is used for “personalisation” – big tech speak for using your data to improve your online experience – but it can reveal a lot about you. For example if you just use its online retail site via the app or website Amazon will collect data such as purchase dates and payment and delivery information.

“From this information Amazon can work out where you work where you live how you spend your leisure time and who your family and friends are” says Rowenna Fielding director of data protection consultancy Miss IG Geek.

At the same time Prime Video and Fire TV information about what you watch and listen to can reveal your politics religion culture and economic status says Fielding. If you use Amazon to store your photos a facial recognition feature is enabled by default she says. “Amazon promises not to share facial recognition data with third parties. But it makes no such commitment about other types of photo data such as geolocation tags device information or attributes of people and objects featured in images.”

Amazon Photos does not sell customer information and data to third parties or use content for ad targeting an Amazon spokesperson says insisting the feature is for ease of use. You also have the option to turn the feature off in the Amazon Photos app or on the website.

Meanwhile Amazon’s Kindle e-reader will collect data such as what you read when how fast you read what you’ve highlighted and book genres. “This could reveal a lot about your thoughts feelings preferences and beliefs” says Fielding pointing out that how often you look up words might indicate how literate you are in a certain language.

Smart speakers have been criticised by privacy advocates and devices such as Amazon’s Echo have been known to be activated accidentally. But Amazon says its Echo devices are designed to record “as little audio as possible”.

No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device detects the wake word and the audio stream is closed immediately after a request has ended an Amazon spokesperson says.

More broadly Amazon says much of the information it collects is needed to keep its products working properly. An Amazon spokesperson says the company is “thoughtful about the information we collect”.

But it can add up to a lot of data. In 2020 a BBC investigation showed how every motion detected by its Ring doorbells and each interaction with the app is stored including the model of phone or tablet and mobile network used. Ring can share your stored data with law enforcement if you give your consent or if a warrant is issued.

How Amazon shares data across its own services

The more services you use the bigger Amazon’s opportunity to collect your data. “If you have bought fully into the Amazon experience you will share details habits and information that the company will collect and potentially use to ‘enhance your experience’” says Richard Hale a senior lecturer in digital forensics at Birmingham City University.

But what exactly is shared within its own companies isn’t clear. The privacy policy section on data sharing within the Amazon group of companies is “pretty limited” says Will Richmond-Coggan an information and privacy law specialist at Freeths LLP. Taking this into account he says people should “assume that any information shared with one Amazon entity will be known to any other”.

How Amazon shares your data with third parties

Like Google and Facebook Amazon operates an advertising network allowing advertisers to use its customer data for targeting.

“Although Amazon doesn’t share information that can directly identify someone such as a name or email address it does allow advertisers to target by demographic location interests and previous purchases” says Paul Bischoff privacy advocate at Comparitech.

Amazon lets other companies track users visiting its website says Wolfie Christl a researcher who investigates the data industry. “It lets companies such as Google and Facebook ‘tag’ people and synchronise identifiers that refer to them. These companies can then potentially better track people on the web and exchange data on them.”

Amazon says it doesn’t sell your data to third parties or use personally identifiable information such as your name or email for advertising purposes. Advertising audiences are only available within its ads systems and cannot be exported and you can opt out of ad targeting via its advertising preferences page.

What you can do to stop Amazon collecting data

Amazon’s data collection is so vast that the only way to stop it completely is not to use the service at all. That requires a lot of dedication but there are some ways to reduce the amount of data collected and shared.

If you are concerned about what Amazon knows about you you can ask the company for a copy of your data by applying under a “data subject access request”. The Alexa assistant and Ring doorbell have their own privacy hubs that allow you to delete recordings and adjust privacy settings. Ring’s Control Centre allows you to tweak settings including who’s able to see and access your videos and personal information from a central dashboard. Speaking to Alexa you can say: “Alexa delete what I just said” or: “Alexa delete everything I said today.”

Amazon says it allows customers to view their browsing and purchase history from “Your Account” and manage which items can be used for product recommendations. More broadly you can also use privacy-focused browsers such as DuckDuckGo or Brave to stop Amazon from tracking you.

But it’s not always easy to change the settings on Amazon itself says Chris Boyd lead analyst at security company Malwarebytes. He recommends turning off browsing history on Amazon and opting out of interest-based ads to reduce the level of tracking by the company. Yet he warns: “You’ll likely still see ads from Amazon or encounter third-party advertisers in one form or another – they just won’t be as targeted.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDIvMjYvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9hbWF6b24tcHJpY2Utc3dpbmdzLXNob3BwaW5nLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Absent or Swinging Prices Keep Consumers Guessing,"When a holiday toy catalog from Amazon arrived in the mail in late October Krista Hoffmann noticed something amiss.

And that likely won't be changing soon as many employees want to continue remote work at some level even as health metrics begin to improve across the globe.

With the switch to remote work there have been concerns around the internet that Alexa may be listening to confidential conversations. This can be alarming especially when the speaker can be activated without you knowing. For example if it's listening for the wake word and hears a similar-sounding term your Echo might begin listening for your command.

Echo users have long been concerned about privacy . It's known that your Echo device stores voice recordings and that Amazon employees can listen in to your Alexa conversations. While Amazon has recently made privacy improvements and it's possible to delete your Amazon voice transcripts maintaining privacy during WFH is still an issue. If you're working from home and concerned about your work's confidential information look to these tips and tricks to keep your data protected.

1. Unplug or mute your Echo speaker

If you're worried that Alexa is listening to confidential work conversations you're having whether it's dealing with a customer's account information or your company's security information simply unplug your Amazon Echo speaker while working. However if you use your Echo for reminders timers or daily routines you can leave your speaker plugged in and turn the microphone off or place it in another room away from where you are.

2. Ensure Alexa skills aren't listening in

In 2018 security researchers discovered malicious skills that exploit the Echo's Unicode character sequence -- which isn't pronounceable. This leaves your speaker listening and waiting for you to say the wake word allowing the app to listen in on you. The researchers have noted that those malicious apps have been removed but you should still be cautious about which apps you download.

Go through your skills settings in the Alexa app and disable any that you haven't used in a while. Read the reviews on apps you're unsure of to make sure nothing troublesome has been detected.

Read Alexa and Google Assistant fall victim to eavesdropping apps for more information.

3. Manage and delete voice recordings on your Amazon Echo

You can view the audio transcripts of your Alexa commands and delete them in the Alexa app. Or you can ask Alexa to delete your voice recordings. Amazon currently offers three Alexa commands that will allow you to delete your voice transcripts. Just say ""Alexa delete what I just said"" or ""Alexa delete everything I said today."" And to delete all of your previous recordings you can say ""Alexa delete everything I've ever said.""

If you prefer to delete your entire history manually open the Alexa app and go to Settings > Alexa Privacy > Review Voice History. Next tap the downward-facing arrow next to Displaying and then the arrow next to Filter By Date. Then you will tap All History > Delete All My Recordings.

4. Keep Amazon employees out of your conversations

The Amazon Echo only starts recording when you say a command to Alexa. Once you say the wake word like Alexa or Echo or some of the other wake word options it starts recording the audio and stores it in the Alexa app on your phone. The transcripts and voice recordings are then uploaded to Amazon's servers for processing. If you don't want your Echo listening for the wake word at all times turn the mic off by pressing the microphone's mute button on top of the device.

Amazon says once they have the transcripts they manually review and annotate a small fraction to help improve the voice assistant. However you can opt-out of this feature and stop Amazon employees from listening to your recordings.

In the Alexa app go to Settings > Alexa Privacy > Manage Your Alexa Data. From here select Choose How Long to Save Recordings > Don't Save Recordings > Confirm. Next scroll down to Help Improve Alexa and switch the Use of Voice Recordings to off.

5. Make sure your Echo Show's camera isn't recording

Most of the Echo Shows in the Echo lineup have built-in privacy features. The Echo Show 5 the Show 8 the Show 10 and the latest Show 15 all have covers for the camera to protect your privacy.

But if you have one of the earlier Echo Show devices like the first and second generation it will not come equipped with the privacy shutters -- but you can disable the camera by pressing the off button. You'll know it's off when the red light comes on. The lens won't be covered but you can always place a sticker or thick tape over the lens for an extra layer of protection.

6. Prevent others from seeing what you ask Alexa



Everything you ask Alexa is saved in the Alexa app as transcripts and voice memos. So if you share the app with others they'll be able to see every command you've given Alexa. If you're worried about someone seeing what you've said -- for example if you told Alexa to buy a gift -- then delete the transcripts immediately (see tips 3 and 4 for guidance).

7. Secure your personal devices connected to Alexa

If you use Alexa to access your bank account information or have it connected to your home security system  you're probably wondering what's stopping someone from accessing that information. Fortunately most banking services require you to create a PIN code for extra security so only you have access to your bank account info.

Want to know more? Follow this guide for connecting Alexa to personal banking info.

As for home security systems find one that allows you to use a personal code so that only you or other household members can turn off the alarms. If your security system doesn't have a PIN feature keep your Echo away from doors and windows to prevent outsiders from having access -- or better yet get a device that works with Alexa.

Amazon is being sued by a man who said he suffered injuries from a crash with a delivery driver.

The incident resulted in the man having his leg amputated according to a lawsuit.

The man alleges that Amazon is at fault for putting pressure on delivery drivers.

A man is suing Amazon after alleging that a crash with a delivery driver led to the amputation of his leg.

The Virginian Pilot first reported the news.

Last October Justin Hartley was riding his motorcycle when he collided with an Amazon-branded Hertz truck in Virginia Beach Virginia per a lawsuit.

According to the lawsuit viewed by Insider the incident caused Hartley to suffer ""severe bodily injuries"" including fractures to his left wrist and leg. His leg could not be saved and was amputated as a result it claimed.

Hartley is seeking $100 million from Amazon as a result of the accident. He alleged that the company was responsible because they put pressure on workers which caused them to become distracted and careless while driving.

After the crash driver Christopher Gill told police that he was looking at the directions on his navigation system provided by Amazon at the time of the accident according to the lawsuit.

Kevin Bazan of Virginia-based law firm Breit Biniazan who represents Hartley discussed the case with Insider. He alleged that ""due to the culture and environment of pressure placed on Amazon drivers"" Gill was subsequently ""more concerned with his GPS system than the safety of others on the roadway.""

He also claimed that the accident was preventable.

Drivers according to the lawsuit are required to use a ""Flex App"" which instructs what route they should take as well as micromanaging when they should take their bathroom or lunch breaks. If the driver is running behind schedule Amazon sends them a text nudging them that they are ""behind the rabbit"" and have to be ""rescued"" as a result it claimed.

If a driver frequently falls off the pace it can also significantly reduce their pay the lawsuit claimed.

""Gill's attention was distracted from the roadway by his use of the Flex App which proximately caused [Hartley's] injuries"" per the lawsuit.

It further alleged that Amazon mandated a delivery schedule that was ""unrealistic"" and ""forces their drivers to rush to deliver packages in a timely manner"" creating the ""foreseeable risk that their drivers will commit traffic violations.""







Amazon did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment made outside of normal working hours.

The lawsuit comes follows last year's reports of grueling working conditions at the retailer. Insider obtained accounts of Amazon drivers who said that urinating in bottles was part of the job because they ""didn't have time to go to the bathroom.""

Reports of employees urinating in bottles have circled Amazon for years but the company previously denied the practice.

In 2019 drivers also described a physically demanding work environment as the company prioritized faster deliveries. At the time Amazon denied the characterization that it prioritized growth over safety.

Hartley's lawsuit alleged that he has — and will continue to be — prevented from performing his daily activities and obtaining the full enjoyment of life as a result of the accident.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vYXdzLmFtYXpvbi5jb20vYmxvZ3MvaW5kdXN0cmllcy90ZWxjby1tZWV0cy1hd3MtY2xvdWQtZGVwbG95aW5nLWRpc2hzLTVnLW5ldHdvcmstaW4tYXdzLWNsb3VkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Telco Meets AWS Cloud: Deploying DISH's 5G Network in AWS Cloud | Amazon Web Services,"DISH Network is deploying the first stand-alone cloud-native autonomous 5G network. The company envisions a complete cloud-native 5G network with all its functions except minimal components of the Radio Access Network (RAN) running in the cloud with fully automated network deployment and operations.

In this blog post we describe DISH’s approach to building a scalable 5G cloud-native network in its entirety on AWS. The blog provides details on how DISH is utilizing the AWS global infrastructure footprint native services and on-demand scalable resources to benefit from the disaggregated nature of a cloud-native 5G Core and RAN network functions. We also discuss the network’s cloud infrastructure integration with parts of DISH’s RAN network that will continue to run on-premises. Telecom business owners and technology practitioners will learn the benefits of utilizing AWS Cloud as a 5G core platform as it enables faster innovation and agility.

System Design Guiding Principles

To achieve DISH’s ambitious 5G rollout target the company’s architecture team partnered with AWS to design a scalable automated platform to run its 5G functions. As an industry first and a groundbreaking deployment the following guidelines were used in architecting the new platform:

Maximize the use of cloud infrastructure and services.

Enable the use of 5G components for services in multiple target environments (Dev/Test/Production/Enterprise) with full automation.

Maximize the use of native automation constructs provided by AWS instead of building overlay automation.

Maintain the flexibility to use a mix of cloud native APIs as well as existing telecom protocols.

Figure 1: DISH 5G Cloud Architecture

Deployment in AWS Cloud

The architecture of DISH’s 5G network leverages the distributed nature of 5G cloud-native network functions and AWS Cloud flexibility which optimizes the placement of 5G network functions for optimal performance based on latency throughput and processing requirements. Through this design DISH aims to provide nationwide 5G coverage.

DISH’s network design utilizes a logical hierarchical architecture consisting of National Data Centers (NDCs) Regional Data Centers (RDCs) and Breakout Edge Data Centers (BEDCs) (Fig 1) to accommodate the distributed nature of 5G functions and the varying requirements for service layer integration. BEDCs are deployed in AWS Local Zones hosting 5G NFs that have strict latency budgets. They are connected with DISH’s Passthrough Edge Data Centers (PEDC) which serve as an aggregation point for all Local Data Centers (LDCs) and cell sites in a particular market. BEDCs also provide internet peering for general 5G data service and enterprise customer-specific private network service.

DISH is pioneering the deployment of a 5G network using O-RAN standards in the United States. An O-RAN network consists of an RU (Radio Unit) which is deployed on towers and a DU (Distributed Unit) which controls the RU. These units interface with the Centralized Unit (CU) which is hosted in the BEDC at the Local Zone. These combined pieces provide a full RAN solution that handles all radio level control and subscriber data traffic.

Colocated in the BEDC is the User Plane Function (Data Network Name (DNN) = Internet) which anchors user data sessions and routes to the internet. The BEDCs leverage local internet access available in AWS Local Zones which allows for a better user experience while optimizing network traffic utilization. This type of edge capability also enables DISH enterprise customers and end-users (gamers streaming media and other applications) to take full advantage of 5G speeds with minimal latency. DISH has access to 16 Local Zones across the U.S. and is continuing to expand. For latest information about Local Zones visit the AWS Local Zone Page.

RDCs are hosted in the AWS Region across multiple availability zones. They host 5G subscribers’ signaling processes such as authentication and session management as well as voice for 5G subscribers. These workloads can operate with relatively high latencies which allows for a centralized deployment throughout a region resulting in cost efficiency and resiliency. For high availability three RDCs are deployed in a region each in a separate Availability Zone (AZ) to ensure application resiliency and high availability. An AZ is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power networking and connectivity in an AWS Region. All AZs in an AWS Region are interconnected with high-bandwidth and low-latency networking over a fully redundant dedicated metro fiber which provides high-throughput low-latency networking between AZs. CNFs deployed in the RDC utilizes an AWS high speed backbone to failover between AZs for application resiliency. CNFs like AMF and SMF which are deployed in RDC continue to be accessible from the BEDC in the Local Zone in case of an AZ failure. They serve as the backup CNF in the neighboring AZ and would take over and service the requests from the BEDC.

The NDCs host a nationwide global service such as subscriber database IMS (IP multimedia subsystem: voice call) OSS (Operating Support System) and BSS (Billing Support System). NDC is hosted in the AWS Region and spans multiple AZs for high availability. To meet geographical diversity requirements NDCs are mapped to AWS Regions where three NDCs are built in three U.S. Regions (us-west-2 us-east-1 and us-east2). AWS Regions us-east-1 and us-east-2 are within 15 ms while us-east-1 to us-west-2 is within 75 ms delay budget. An NDC is built to span across three AZs for high availability.

Figure 2: DISH 5G Architecture in AWS Cloud

Cloud Infrastructure Architecture

DISH 5G netowrk’s architecture utilizes Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to represent NDCs/RDCs or BEDCs (xDCs). Amazon VPC enables DISH to launch CNF resources on a virtual network. This virtual network is intended to closely resemble an on-premises network but also contains all the resources needed forData Center functions. The VPCs hosting each of the xDCs are fully interconnected utilizing AWS global network and AWS Transit Gateway. AWS Transit Gateway is used in AWS Regions to provide connectivity between VPCs deployed in the NDCs RDCs and BEDCs with scalability and resilience (Fig2).

AWS Direct Connect provides connectivity from RAN DUs (on-prem) to AWS Local Zones where cell sites are homed. Cell sites are mapped to a particular AWS Local Zone based on proximity to meet 5G RAN mid-haul latency expected between DU and CU.

5G Core Network Connectivity

In the AWS network each Region hosts one NDC and three RDCs. NDC functions communicate to each other through the Transit Gateway where each VPC has an attachment to the specific regional Transit Gateway. EC2 and native AWS networking is referred to as “Underlay Network” in this network architecture. Provisioning of Transit Gateway and required attachments are automated using CI/CD pipelines with AWS APIs. Transit Gateway routing tables are utilized to maintain isolation of traffic between functions.

Some of the 5G core network functions require support for advanced routing capabilities inside VPC and across VPCs (Ex. UPF SMF and ePDG). These functions reply to routing protocols such as BGP for route exchange and fast failover (both stateful and stateless). To support these requirements virtual routers (vRTRs) are deployed on EC2 to provide connectivity within and across VPCs as well as back to the on-prem network.

Traffic from vRTRs is encapsulated using Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnels creating an “Overlay Network.’ This leverages the Underlay network for end-point reachability. The Overlay network uses Intermediate Systems to Intermediate Systems (IS-IS) routing protocol in conjunction with Segment Routing Multi-Protocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) to distribute routing information and establish network reachability between the vRTRs. Multi-Protocol Border Gateway Protocol (MP-BGP) over GRE is used to provide reachability from on-prem to AWS Overlay network and reachability between different regions in AWS. The combined solution provides DISH the ability to honor requirements such as traffic isolation and efficiently route traffic between on-prem AWS and 3rd parties (e.g. voice aggregators regulatory entities etc.).

AWS Direct Connect for DISH’s RAN Mid-Haul

AWS Direct Connect is leveraged to provide connectivity between DISH’s RAN network and the AWS Cloud. Each Local Zone is connected over 2*100G Direct Connect links for redundancy. Direct Connect in combination with Local Zone provides a sub 10 msec Midhaul connectivity between DISH’s on-prem RAN and BEDC. End-to-end SR-MPLS provides connectivity from cell sites to Local Zone and AWS region via Overlay Network using the vRTRs. Through thisDISH has the ability to extend multiple Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF)from RAN to the AWS Cloud.

AWS Local Zone and Internet Peering

Internet access is provided by AWS within the Local Zone. This “hot potato” routing approach is the most efficient way of handling traffic rather than backhauling traffic to the region a centralized location or incurring the cost of maintaining a dedicated internet circuit. It improves subscriber experience and provides low latency internet. This architecture also reduces the failure domain by distributing internet among multiple Local Zones.

Figure 3: Network Resilience and Failover Scenarios

Network Resiliency

In telco-grade networks resiliency is at the heart of design. It’s vital to maintain the targeted service-level agreements (SLAs) comply with regulatory requirements and support seamless failover of services. While redundancy and resiliency are addressed at various layers of the 5G stack we will focus here on transport availability in failure scenarios. High availability and geo-redundancy are NF dependent while some NFs are required to maintain state.

NDC High Availability: High availability is achieved by deploying two redundant NFs in two separate availability zones within a single VPC. Failover within an AZ can be recovered within the region without the need to route traffic to other regions. The in-region networking uses the underlay and overlay constructs which enable on-prem traffic to seamlessly flow to the standby NF in the secondary AZ if the active NF becomes unavailable. Geo-Redundancy : Geo-Redundancy is achieved by deploying two redundant NFs in two separate availability zones in more than one region. This is achieved by interconnecting all VPCs via inter-region Transit Gateway and leveraging vRTR for overlay networking. The overlay network is built as a full-mesh enabling service continuity using the NFs deployed across NDCs in other regions during outage scenarios (e.g. Markets B-EDCs RDCs in us-east-2 can continue to function using the NDC in us-east-1).

RDC High availability and geo-redundancy are achieved by NFs failover between VPCs (multiple Availability zones) within one region. These RDCs are interconnected via Transit Gateway with the vRTR-based overlay network. This provides on-premise and B-EDC reachability to the NFs deployed in each RDC with route policies in place to ensure traffic only flows to the backup RDCs if the primary RDC becomes unreachable.



PEDC DISH’s RAN network is connected through PEDC to two different direct connect locations for reachability into the region and local zone This allows for DU traffic to be rerouted from an active BEDC to backup BEDC in the event a local zone fails (Fig3).



Deployment Automation: As a Code

For network automation as well as scalability the AWS and DISH architecture teams selected the infrastructure as code (IaC) to enable automation. It can be tempting to create resources manually in the short term but using infrastructure as code:

Enables full auditing capabilities of infrastructure deployment and changes.

Provides the ability to deploy a network infrastructure rapidly and at scale.

Simplifies operational complexity by using code and templates as well as reduces the risk of misconfiguration.

All infrastructure components such as VPCs and subnets to TGWs are deployed using AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) and AWS CloudFormation templates. Both AWS CDK and Cloud Formation use parameterization and embedded code (through Lambda) to allow for automation of various environment deployments without the need to hardcode dynamic configuration information within the template.

AWS has pioneered the development of new CI/CD tools to help a broad spectrum of industries develop and roll out software changes rapidly while maintaining systems stability and security. These tools include a set of DevOps (software development and operations) services such as AWS CodeStar AWS CodeCommit AWS CodePipeline AWS CodeBuild and AWS CodeDeploy. Moreover AWS has also been evangelizing the idea of IaC using AWS CDK AWS CloudFormation and API-based third-party tools (e.g. Terraform). Using these tools NF deployment processes can be stored in AWS as a source code and maintain the same source code in the CI/CD pipeline for continuous delivery.

The DISH and AWS teams worked with independent software vendors (ISVs) to deploy CNFs following cloud-native principles with full CI/CD observability and configuration through cloud-native tools like Helm and ConfigMaps. This approach combined with the resiliency components discussed earlier maximizes 5G service availability in outage scenarios at the networking domain or when NFs are impacted by failures.

The CI/CD process developed in partnership with DISH and ISVs includes the following steps:

Network setup – AWS CDK and CloudFormation initiate the creation of the network prerequisites Networking stack ( VPC Subnets NAT gateway route table and internet gateway)

Infrastructure deployment – AWS CDK and CloudFormation initiate the creation of the following resource stacks: Compute stack (EKS cluster creation EKS worker nodes Lambda) Storage stack ( S3 buckets EBS volumes and EFS) Monitoring stack (Amazon CloudWatch Amazon OpenSearch Service) Security stack ( IAM roles IAM policies EC2 security groups VPC NACLs)

CNF deployment – In this stage CNF is deployed onto EKS clusters using Kubectl and Helm chart tools. This stage also deploys any specific applications or tools needed by the CNFs to work efficiently (e.g. Prometheus Fluentd). CNFs can be either deployed via Lambda functions or AWS CodeBuild which can be part of the AWS CodePipeline stages.

Continuous updates and deployment – These are a sequence of steps that will be carried out iteratively to deploy changes \ as part of container and configuration changes resulting in upgrades. Similar to the CNF deployment case this is automated using AWS services with the trigger from AWS CodeCommit Amazon Elastic Container Registry or third-party source systems such as GitLab Webhook.

Figure 4: AWS CI/CD Pipeline Flow

The CI/CD pipeline is built using AWS CodePipeline and utilizes a continuous delivery service that models visualizes and automates the steps required to release software. By defining stages in a pipeline you can retrieve code from a source code repository build that source code into a releasable artifact test the artifact and deploy it to production. Only code that successfully passes through all stages will be deployed. In addition other requirements can be added to the pipeline such as manual approvals to help ensure that only approved changes are deployed to production.

Figure 5: DISH CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

By leveraging infrastructure as code DISH can automate the creation (and decommissioning) of environments. This increases the pace of innovation reduces human error and ensures compliance with DISH’s security postures. The automated CI/CD pipeline checkpoints and constant monitoring tools like Amazon GuardDuty (threat protection) and Amazon Macie (sensitive data identification and protection) is included in infrastructure as a code for security checks.

CI/CD Security

Security is a critical element in the network design and is introduced to various parts of the solution. Below is a list of security steps that DISH and AWS CI/CD processes would take into account while deploying an application.

Source: The ECR repository allocated to the ISV is configured with “Scan on Push” flag enabled so that any uploads of Docker images will be immediately subjected to a security scan. Any known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) are flagged with notifications. Apart from ECR the charts put into AWS CodeCommit repository the ISVs will be requested to encrypt any passwords used using AWS Secrets Manager rather than in plain text.

Artifacts integrity: The artifacts used across the pipeline are encrypted both at rest (using AWS managed keys) and in transit (using SSL/TLS).

IAM users and roles: User or resource permissions provided are based on the principle of minimum permission. Cross-IAM role trust relationship is configured and used for operating across resources in different services for example AWS CodeBuild needing permission to run commands on an EKS cluster.

Audit: The auditing capability of AWS CloudTrail service is used to maintain an audit trail in the DISH environments. It tracks each and every API call across services and user operations and will allow an evaluation of any past events.

Image vulnerability scanning: CNF images that are uploaded to Amazon ECR are automatically scanned for security vulnerabilities. A report of the scan findings is available in the AWS console and can also be retrieved via API. The findings can also be sent to the accountable parties for corrective action including replacement of the CNF image.

Security checks are kicked off at various stages of the pipeline to ensure the newly uploaded image is secure and complies with the desired compliance checks and a notification can be sent to DISH for approval. The container registry would scan for any open CVE vulnerabilities. The configuration is checked against leaking out any sensitive information (known PII pattern) the test stage triggers compliance check rules (for example unexpected open TCP/UDP ports DOS vulnerabilities) and eventually verifies backward and forward compatibility for graceful upgrade and rollback safety. Apart from the application it is critical to provision pipeline security by ensuring encrypted transfer of artifacts across stages whether at rest or in transit.

Beginning of 5G

In this post we presented a cloud-native architecture for deploying 5G networks on AWS Cloud. By utilizing the AWS Cloud DISH was able to architect design build and deliver a complete cloud-native 5G network with full operations and network deployment automation including adoption of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) and other open community projects. This platform allows DISH to create innovative new services and react faster to customer demands. It also mitigates heavy lifting activities that put additional work loads on the architecture engineering and operations teams.

We’d Zoomed but headshots hid what was going on in our lives.

As Australia’s restrictions eased my daughter wanted me to visit her in Salt Lake City Utah. I had to blurt out what I’d been successfully hiding.

“My knee is worse. I haven’t been able to get medical help because of COVID. And the pool my normal form of exercise has been closed during Melbourne’s lockdowns. Expect to see me hobbling.”

My comment was to warn her of my reduced mobility. But her thoughts turned to airports. She’d recently walked her exhausted 4-year-old through the new SLC Airport the 12th largest airport in the world – not something she could forget.

“Book special assistance” she warned.

Do Know Your Rights

I’d always thought of special assistance as a service for those unable to walk not for those who might find airports difficult and miss connections due to their reduced mobility.

But this is a growing issue. Passengers with restricted mobility represent one of the fastest-growing demographics in aviation.

Whether you’re a passenger with a disability or someone with reduced mobility you are legally entitled to the support known as “Special Assistance.” All American airlines and airlines flying in and out of the U.S. must offer such assistance.

Do Make Your Needs Known

Travel agents can book your flights with special assistance. If you make the booking request special assistance at least 48 hours before your flight through your airline.

This move creates a red flag whenever an airport employee looks at your ticket or boarding pass.

Unfortunately there’s a one-size-fits-all approach. The system flags you as needing a wheelchair all the way which isn’t necessarily what you require. You may well be able to stand when going through security. You may also only need assistance getting to the gate and not going down the gangway onto the plane.

Let the staff know your needs. That way you are more likely to get the individual support you require rather than being treated as a “generic disability.”

Don’t Judge

Airports have grown in size. The increasing wingspans of aircraft mean gates are spaced further apart and concourses have grown exponentially to create additional gates. It is not uncommon to walk over a mile in larger airports. Examples include Atlanta Hartsfield where the international terminal and domestic check-in distance is 1.67 miles. In Philadelphia the distance is 1.5 miles.

Not everyone can trek that far.

The 1986 Air Carrier Access Act requires airlines to provide free wheelchair service to any traveler who requests it.

I saw lots of what I considered healthy people requiring airport assistance. Were they just avoiding a long walk? Then I realized people were probably looking at me the same way. They couldn’t see the bone chip in my knee.

“Judge not lest ye be judged.”

Many people have less visible conditions such as heart disease arthritis chronic pain or are recovering after a fall or surgery. These are all valid reasons for using special assistance.

Do Use Airlines With A Good Track Record

Before using special assistance I didn’t realize that there is a marked difference between airlines. I had both a poor and a brilliant experience.

On my flight from SLC to LAX the flight attendant muttered “Let’s know if you need any help” as she rushed past.

I didn’t see her again and there was no help on arrival. With 4 hours between flights I decided I’d locate my international gate. How far could it possibly be?

An information desk attendant from the same airline barked directions. She was so gruff that I didn’t ask twice. I did approach various people along the way. The gist was that there was a bus to the international airport but if I went outside I’d have to stand in endless queues to check in again. I should make my way inside the airport to the John Bradly International Terminal.

The route was a minotaur’s maze of endless tunnels passageways. The signage was unclear and boarded-up areas meant there was no way to see outside to gain my bearings. I was probably walking in circles.

When I reached my gate I’d limped 2.5 miles. I was in severe pain and felt demoralized.

It was a different experience on the Qantas flight home. The flight attendant asked if I needed assistance when I reached Melbourne. “Yes please!” I did not want to get caught out again.

On arrival I was met by a slight woman in high heels and a Qantas uniform who pushed me seemingly effortlessly in a chair. She coordinated to meet a male colleague at the baggage carousel to retrieve my heavy case. Jointly they escorted me through customs. I expected to be left at that point but they left me near where I could access an Uber. They repeatedly asked me until the last second if they could help me further.

According to Mobility Deck Qantas is the top airline for passengers with disabilities. Others with good reputations include American Airlines Air Canada Delta Airlines Jet Blue Virgin Atlantic and Emirates. Research the airline you plan to travel on.

Do Find Out What Services Airports Offer

Larger airports contract with companies to help less-mobile passengers move around their vast terminals. Many of us would prefer electric carts but busy airports are concerned about congestion. Wheelchairs take up less room.

I used the pushchair service in SLC and it was a positive experience. There is a designated desk where you can wait for the next available attendant to escort you.

My lovely attendant steered me over a mile. He mentioned any documents I would need to pull out at the checkpoints. He knew where all the lifts were and as we navigated past a throng of kids with dangerous-looking suitcases on wheels I was glad he was the one navigating the tripping hazards.

There’s officially no cost for such a service although in most U.S. airports I gather the attendants are paid based on an assumption they’ll be receiving tips. And trawling the internet I found it is common to tip.

Do Speak Up

Stating your needs and abilities will help your wheelchair attendant offer the best possible service.

It is helpful to know if you can stand and walk through security. And whether you need help putting your carry-on items on the screening belt.

If you are under 75 you will need to take your shoes off to go through the checkpoint. If they know this in advance they can help you juggle your belongings while you do so.

Do Request Stops If Needed

Your wheelchair attendant should offer you a restroom stop on the way to your gate then wait outside the bathrooms.

I saw an attendant buying a woman water and snacks in an airport store in LAX. It dawned on me that some people request stops along the way in the U.S. where the expectation is to tip for service.

Don’t Forget to Plan Ahead

However your wheelchair attendant is not required to take you to a shop or fast food stand. And you may find your gate is a long way from food outlets. As you may have hours to wait for your plane plan accordingly and bring food with you.

Do Factor In More Time

Some people feel that those seeking airport assistance are working the system. Having used the service and observed others using it I don’t feel this is often the case.

Sometimes there is a significant wait for an escort so special assistance is not an automatic timesaver.

Nor does being pushed in a chair result in head-of-line privileges at the checkpoints. In Melbourne I was the random number selected to go through the sniffer dog station to check for drugs. It was a novel experience for the busy Qantas team members pushing me. I felt like joking: I’d brought my own pushers. But jokes seldom go down well with airport security.

Yes you get to board the plane earlier than other passengers. But this time saving is balanced out at your destination when the entire plane with hundreds of passengers disembark before you do.

You are last in the queue when you finally leave for processing although sometimes you have waited so long on the plane that the crowds have dispersed.

Don’t Be Shy About Asking For Assistance

Airport assistance is a free service the U.S. Department of Transportation requires airlines to provide – so don’t be shy about asking for assistance.

Airport floors are shiny and generally level perfect for the wheels on suitcases and wheelchairs. A child could push one of the specialized chairs. Waiting at SLC my 4-year-old grandson thought it would be fun to take me for a spin. I was relieved when the attendant arrived and rescued me for a more sedate ride.

Many of us don’t require wheelchairs in our day-to-day life such as navigating supermarket aisles or strolling through a park.

The problem is the rise in walking required at the new mega-airports and the increased time spent in airline queues due to increased security measures and paperwork.

Some airports such as Christchurch Heathrow Gatwick Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky and Tampa International Airport have begun trialing self-driving vehicles for those with reduced mobility.

But for now special assistance mostly means being pushed in a chair. Wheelchair services aren’t quite what we need in totality but they are the best services on offer for now.

If Moscow shuts down the grid millions could be left without light heat refrigeration water phones and internet. The White House is monitoring our own critical infrastructure after two Department of Homeland Security warnings last month about threats to our grid. One noted Russia has proven its ability to use cyber attacks to shut down electric grids and ""compromised U.S. energy networks."" We've been looking at the grid for months and were surprised to learn how vulnerable it is and how often it's deliberately targeted. One attack nine years ago was a wake-up call for industry and government.

On the night of April 16 2013 a mysterious incident south of San Jose marked the most serious attack on our power grid in history.

For 20 minutes gunmen methodically fired at high voltage transformers at the Metcalf Power substation. Security cameras captured bullets hitting the chain link fence.

Jon Wellinghoff: They knew what they were doing. They had a specific objective. They wanted to knock out the substation.

At the time Jon Wellinghoff was chairman of FERC the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission a small government agency with jurisdiction over the U.S. high voltage transmission system.

Bill Whitaker: You were concerned enough that you flew out there?

Jon Wellinghoff: That's correct. And I took two other individuals who train special forces U.S. special forces. They train people to actually attack infrastructure.

Jon Wellinghoff

And what the former commandos found looked familiar. They discovered the attackers had reconnoitered the site and marked firing positions with piles of rocks. That night they broke into two underground vaults and cut off communications coming from the substation.

Jon Wellinghoff: Then they went from these vaults across this road over into a pasture area here. There were at least four or five different firing positions.

Bill Whitaker: No real security?

Jon Wellinghoff: There was no security at all really.

They aimed at the narrow cooling fins causing 17 of 21 large transformers to overheat and stop working.

Jon Wellinghoff: They hit them 90 times so they were very accurate. And they were doing this at night with muzzle flash in their face.

Someone outside the plant heard gunfire and called 911. The gunmen disappeared without a trace about a minute before a patrol car arrived. The substation was down for weeks but fortunately PG&E had enough time to reroute power and avoid disaster.

Bill Whitaker: If they had succeeded what would've happened?

Jon Wellinghoff: Could've brought down all of Silicon Valley.

Bill Whitaker: We're talking Google Apple; all these guys--

Jon Wellinghoff: Yes yes. That's correct.

Bill Whitaker: Who do you think this could have been?

Jon Wellinghoff: I don't know. We don't know if they were a nation state. We don't know if they were domestic actors. But it was somebody who did have competent people who could in fact plan out this kind of a very sophisticated attack.

The grid is a sprawling target. There are actually three in the U.S.: the eastern western and Texas has its own. Most of us rarely notice substations. There are 55000 across the country each housing transformers the workhorses of the grid. Inside these massive metal boxes raw electricity is converted to higher or lower voltages.

Should a transformer explode like this one in Manhattan during Superstorm Sandy the system is designed to trigger a localized grid-preserving blackout. But if several sections of the grid go down at the same time the shutdowns can cascade like dominoes. That's what set off the great Northeast Blackout in 2003 leaving 45 million Americans without power. A few months before the assault on Metcalf Jon Wellinghoff of FERC commissioned a study to see if a physical attack on critical transformers could trigger cascading blackouts.

Jon Wellinghoff: It was actually a very shocking result to us that there's very few number of substations you need to take out in the entire United States to knock out the entire grid.

Bill Whitaker: Knock out the entire grid?

Jon Wellinghoff: That's correct.

Bill Whitaker: How many would it take to knock out putting the entire country in a blackout?

Jon Wellinghoff: Less than 20.

The report was leaked to the Wall Street Journal. It found the U.S. could suffer a coast-to-coast blackout if saboteurs knocked out just nine substations.

Bill Whitaker: You are relaying this in a very measured way. I would think this would be quite alarming.

Jon Wellinghoff: It was alarming. There's no question. It is alarming.

Dr. Granger Morgan

After the Metcalf attack FERC pressed the utilities to harden defenses at their most critical substations – erect walls and sensors to prevent similar attacks – there's now a wall around Metcalf. But many substations remain vulnerable targets like one we found in southern California that serves more than 300000 customers - huge transformers protected by a chain link fence.

Dr. Granger Morgan: Anybody who knows about power systems knows that the the grid is physically spread all over the countryside. There are a lot of places that are vulnerable.

Dr. Granger Morgan is a Carnegie Mellon University professor of engineering who chaired three National Academy of Sciences reports on the power grid for the U.S. government – the most recent in 2021. An earlier report on terrorism was classified for five years.

Dr. Granger Morgan: We simply made a strong case that the grid was physically very vulnerable.

Bill Whitaker: Why was there a specific report on terrorism and the grid?

Dr. Granger Morgan: There were concerns about the possibility that a terrorist organization could attack the grid. And around the world there have been a fair number of attacks on grids.

They have attacked with bombs planes and drones. Russia's cyber attack on Ukraine's grid in 2015 knocked about 60 substations offline leaving 230000 people in the dark. The U.S. secretary of energy has said Russia could do the same thing here.

Dr. Granger Morgan: In the report we did on the resilience of the power system we did argue that we needed an organization probably DOE and Department of Homeland Security to systematically look at all the kinds of vulnerabilities we have and then begin to figure out who could address each. In terms of resilience issues there's nobody in charge. I mean there's no single entity that has responsibility for everything.

Mike Mabee: The U.S. electric grid is the largest machine in the history of mankind. It is a marvel of modern engineering. No one person owns or controls it. It's actually 3000 different companies both public and private sector that own or operate little pieces of the electric grid.

Mike Mabee is an Iraq war vet a former cop and a self-taught grid security expert. By day he works for the government. In his spare time he uncovers public information electric utilities would rather not see the light of day and publishes them on a website called ""Grid Security Now."" He is both fascinated and horrified by the grid.

Mike Mabee

Mike Mabee: I think everybody needs to be as alarmed as I am. We've had disasters in the past but they've generally always been regional in scale. What we've never had is a national-scale blackout which is completely possible under some known threats such as the cyber threat the physical security threat or even extreme weather. And the U.S. public is completely unprepared to survive without the electric grid for any period of time whatsoever.

So when he moved to Texas two years ago he prepared for the worst installing solar wind and battery power.

Mike Mabee: The whole system's 48 volts.

Mabee's family survived last winter's deadly storm hundreds of Texans perished.

Mike Mabee: And the deaths were largely due to hypothermia carbon monoxide poisoning because when people got cold they would do things like go into their car in the garage to try to stay warm.

Mabee has become a thorn in the side of the federal government and utility companies.

Mike Mabee: I filed a complaint about supply chain cybersecurity. I filed a complaint about physical security. I filed a complaint about the Texas blackout.

Bill Whitaker: The government and the industry. They think you're an annoyance?

Mike Mabee: I've been termed a ""grid security gadfly"" which I wear that as a badge of honor.

One frequent target: the Department of Energy. Mabee told us the grid information the DOE puts out is confusing and dispersed. He said he spends hours trying to make sense of it all.

Mike Mabee: There is a requirement that they report electric disturbance events. But the data from the Department of Energy is so bad. So you know I took it upon myself to do some data crunching. And what I found is that 38% of the electric disturbance events in the United States are due to physical attacks against the electric.

Bill Whitaker: 38%? That's a lot.

Mike Mabee: So in the past decade there have been over 700 physical attacks against the U.S. electric grid.

Many are copy cats of the Metcalf assault. In 2016 an eco terrorist in Utah shot up a large transformer triggering a blackout. He said he'd planned to hit five substations in one day to shut down the West Coast. In 2020 the FBI uncovered a white supremacist plot called ""lights out"" to simultaneously attack substations around the country.

Dr. Liz Sherwood-Randall and Anne Neuberger

Dr. Liz Sherwood-Randall: We're seeing planning to disable the delivery of power to the American people.

Dr. Liz Sherwood-Randall is President Biden's homeland security advisor. We met with her and Anne Neuberger deputy national security advisor for cyber. They told us the administration's infrastructure plans should help secure the grid but acknowledge the threats are real.

Dr. Liz Sherwood-Randall: We have physical threats to the grid. We have natural threats to the grid. We have cyber threats to the grid.

Neuberger came to the White House from the secretive National Security Agency where she battled Russian hackers in cyberspace.

Bill Whitaker: You said that you've been talking to private utility companies around the country about the potential for a cyber attack. What are you telling them?

Anne Neuberger: We're sharing with them some of the context regarding how Russia and other countries use cyber in crisis or conflict. We've actively downgraded intelligence. We've taken any information we have about malicious software or tactics that the Russian government has used shared that with the private sector with very practical advice of how to protect against it.

Bill Whitaker: Isn't the problem that when it comes to the grid there's nothing like the FAA or the Food and Drug Administration or the Securities and Exchange Commission? There's no one overall agency overseeing these you said 3000 different utilities across the country?

Dr. Liz Sherwood-Randall: We don't have one system. We have several grids. We also have individual energy ecosystems in regions and states. And that's part of our strength because the resources for energy are different in different regions. And we have to acknowledge that we're not going to have a one-size-fits-all system.

Bill Whitaker: You call it one of our strengths. But it also seems to be one of our vulnerabilities.

Dr. Liz Sherwood-Randall: Well in my view we can't impose the regulations that would-- you would be suggesting as a federal government. We can set standards and we are setting standards in a variety of arenas.

Carnegie Mellon's Granger Morgan says what government industry and law enforcement are doing doesn't meet the magnitude of the threat.

Dr. Granger Morgan: What we need at this point is to get the White House to put all the key players together in a room to identify the biggest vulnerabilities and then take steps to reduce them.

Bill Whitaker: I'm surprised that's not being done.

Dr. Granger Morgan: It has not been done. And it needs to happen now.

Greenhouse gases and “major questions”: Justices to hear argument on EPA’s power to tackle climate change

Three days after President Joe Biden named Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson as his nominee to succeed the retiring Justice Stephen Breyer Breyer and his colleagues will return to the bench on Monday morning to hear oral argument in a case involving the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases. Although the case hinges on a highly technical provision of the Clean Air Act it nonetheless has the potential to be one of the most consequential cases in a term packed with blockbuster cases. In briefs filed in the case stakeholders ranging from climate scientists to companies like Apple and Amazon emphasize the importance of the EPA’s role in regulating greenhouse-gas emissions and caution the justices against a ruling that would they say hamstring the EPA’s ability to take nationwide action to fight climate change. And depending on exactly how the justices rule their decision could limit the power of federal agencies more broadly.

Background: The long-running fight over greenhouse-gas regulation

The dispute at the center of West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency began with the Obama administration’s adoption of the Clean Power Plan a 2015 rule that sought to combat climate change by reducing carbon pollution from power plants. The plan set individual goals for each state to cut power-plant emissions instructed the states to submit their plans by 2018 and then gave them until 2030 to meet their goals. Several states and private plaintiffs went to federal court to challenge the plan and in February 2016 the Supreme Court dividing 5-4 put the plan on hold before it could go into effect.

In 2019 the Trump administration’s EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan and issued a more lenient policy known as the Affordable Clean Energy Rule that established a different set of emission guidelines for existing coal-fired steam plants. The ACE Rule gave states discretion in setting standards and gave power plants flexibility in complying with those standards.

The Trump EPA argued that it was compelled to repeal the Clean Power Plan because it exceeded the agency’s authority under the Clean Air Act. Section 7411 of the act authorizes the EPA to determine the “best system of emission reduction” for buildings that emit air pollutants. That provision according to the Trump administration and the coal industry is limited to measures that can be implemented on the physical premises of a power plant – a limitation known in industry parlance as “inside the fenceline.” Inside-the-fenceline measures include things like installing equipment that can reduce a plant’s pollution.

The Clean Power Plan by contrast included some measures that operated industry-wide. For example the plan called for “generation shifting” which is reducing emissions by shifting the source of power generation from higher-emitting power plants to lower-polluting sources of energy (such as wind or solar power) and “emissions trading” when the government sets a cap on emissions and requires permits for emissions allowed under that cap.

A different set of plaintiffs challenged the Trump EPA’s decision to repeal the Clean Power Plan as well as its adoption of the ACE Rule. In a decision on Jan. 19 2021 — on the Trump administration’s final full day in office — the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the repeal of the Clean Power Plan vacated the ACE Rule and sent the issue back to the EPA for additional proceedings. The D.C. Circuit explained that it found “nothing in the text structure history or purpose of Section 7411 that compels the reading the EPA adopted.” Two coal-mining companies and 20 Republican-led states including West Virginia and North Dakota asked the Supreme Court to review the D.C. Circuit’s ruling. They are supported by a trade association for coal plants but perhaps surprisingly most large power companies have lined up on the other side. Those companies have indicated a preference for the Clean Power Plan’s emphasis on grid-wide measures to control emissions.

Last fall the justices agreed to take up the case. Meanwhile the Biden administration indicated that it would not reinstate the Clean Power Plan; instead it is drafting its own rules on greenhouse-gas emissions from power plants. And although the Clean Power Plan has never taken effect its emissions goals have already been reached – more than a decade early – through market forces in the rapidly changing energy industry.

A threshold issue: The court’s power to decide the case

There are four separate sets of parties defending the D.C. Circuit’s decision in the Supreme Court: the Biden administration; interest groups that include the American Lung Association and the Sierra Club; a group of Democratic-led state and local governments led by New York; and several of the country’s largest power companies which include Consolidated Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric. They argue as a threshold matter that the Republican-led states and the coal companies do not have a legal right to bring this case to the Supreme Court at all because they are not harmed by the D.C. Circuit’s decision. That decision is on hold they note until the Biden EPA issues a new rule – which means that the Clean Power Plan will never go into effect. As a result they stress there is no regulation governing greenhouse-gas emissions from existing power plants that currently applies to the states or companies.

Instead the Biden administration and others contend what the Republican-led states and the coal companies are really concerned about in this case is what the EPA might do in its new rulemaking to limit emissions. But the appropriate time to challenge that rule is after the EPA issues it. According to the administration the states and coal companies are effectively asking the court to issue an impermissible “advisory opinion” about the EPA’s power.

The states and companies counter that under the D.C. Circuit’s ruling the Biden administration is free to re-adopt the regulatory provisions of the Clean Power Plan. That possibility they say means there is still a live dispute for the court to resolve. And it is undisputed the states and companies add that they had a legal right to sue when they initially contested the Clean Power Plan in court.

A major battle over the “major questions” doctrine

Beyond the question of whether the court has jurisdiction to resolve the dispute at all the two sides in the case focus on three main questions. The first is a relatively straightforward question of statutory interpretation: whether Section 7411 does indeed limit the EPA to requiring measures to reduce emissions “inside the fenceline.” The Republican-led states and the coal companies argue that it does while the Biden administration (and its supporters) counter that it does not.

But the real battle focuses on the argument made by the states and coal companies that the D.C. Circuit’s decision interpreting Section 7411 to give the EPA more expansive authority violates the “major questions” doctrine – the idea that if Congress wants to give an administrative agency the power to make “decisions of vast economic and political significance” it must say so clearly. Even if the Clean Air Act addresses what (greenhouse gas emissions) and whom (power plans) the EPA can regulate West Virginia writes it doesn’t say how it can do so. And the Clean Power Plan West Virginia asserts is undoubtedly “major” – it was projected to cost hundreds of billions of dollars and require a massive overhaul of a major sector of the U.S. economy. (Even though the Clean Power Plan has never taken effect the U.S. nonetheless achieved its carbon-reduction goals nine years early due to market effects in the rapidly changing energy industry.)

In its brief North American Coal Company describes the question of addressing climate change on a national level as a “serious issue that tees up hard policy choices.” It urges the justices to reverse the D.C. Circuit’s decision “to ensure that those momentous trade-offs are made by Congress as the Constitution contemplates.”

The interest groups and the power companies that are defending the D.C. Circuit’s decision push back against the idea that the major-questions doctrine should apply to this case. The Supreme Court the groups stress has never applied that doctrine to a rule that is no longer in effect and would not impose any real costs even if it were revived. Moreover they add in its 2011 decision in American Electric Power v. Connecticut the Supreme Court ruled that Section 7411 gives the EPA the power to decide how to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants.

The Biden administration emphasizes that although “outside the fenceline” measures could theoretically have significant practical consequences that does not mean that all steps that the EPA takes necessarily fall within the scope of the major-questions doctrine. The administration distinguishes this case from the Supreme Court’s recent decision relying on the major-questions doctrine to block the administration’s vaccine-or-test mandate for large employers. Although the court ruled in that case that Congress had not given the Occupational Safety and Health Administration the power to adopt measures that would apply to all large employers it made clear that OSHA did have the power to adopt targeted measures in cases in which “the virus poses a special danger because of particular features of an employee’s job or workplace.” The same is true with the EPA’s power to regulate greenhouse gases the administration argues and the court should not hamstring the agency’s power in advance by declaring all outside-the-fenceline measures impermissible before anyone knows what the “practical significance or insignificance” of the Biden administration’s rule will be.

The states and coal companies urge the justices to reverse the D.C. Circuit’s ruling for another reason. Unless Section 7411 is read to limit EPA’s power they say it would violate the non-delegation doctrine the idea that Congress cannot delegate its legislative powers to other institutions. Westmoreland Mining contends that allowing EPA to include outside-the-fenceline measures like generation shifting “allows EPA to shrug off the statutory criteria that would otherwise limit its regulatory discretion” giving it “unbridled power” to “decide what industries to target how fast to proceed and how far to go in achieving its objectives.”

The Biden administration the interest groups and the power companies reject any suggestion that upholding the D.C. Circuit’s decision would violate the nondelegation doctrine. The Supreme Court has long emphasized they say that Congress does not violate the nondelegation doctrine as long as it provides an “intelligible principle” to guide the agency’s exercise of authority. Section 7411 does exactly that: It directs the EPA to consider a variety of factors (including cost and whether the limitations are achievable) to reduce pollution.

The Supreme Court has applied the major-questions doctrine twice in the last year not only in the vaccine case but also in lifting a federal ban on evictions imposed by the Centers for Disease Control because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both of those cases however came to the court on the so-called shadow docket. In this case the justices could issue a full-fledged ruling on the merits that could if they accept the arguments by the states and coal companies limit the power of not only the EPA but other administrative agencies.

The major-questions doctrine was clearly at the forefront of some justices’ minds even before Monday’s oral argument. At last week’s argument in a case involving gambling on Native American reservations Justice Elena Kagan asserted that the various doctrines on which courts rely to interpret statutes are “all over the place.” She specifically mentioned the “supposed major-questions canon” and she suggested that “maybe we should just toss them all out.” Other justices however were less convinced. Justice Brett Kavanaugh agreed that Kagan’s question was “important” but he countered that the canons of statutory interpretation are more structured and make more sense than Kagan gave them credit for. The debate will no doubt continue on Monday.

“This project is doing it all: creating good-paying jobs providing clean power to New Mexico and beyond and cutting emissions from the energy sector” said Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. “New Mexico is leading the pack – nationally and globally – in the renewable energy space. At the state level at the county level at the city level at the village level New Mexico is all in on the economic and environmental benefits this industry provides.”

U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich said “The Western Spirit Transmission Line literally rewrote the energy landscape in New Mexico—allowing us to build four new utility-scale wind projects in central and eastern New Mexico that make up the largest single-phase wind project in all of North America. I was proud to support this project every step of the way. As we build more transformative infrastructure projects like this New Mexico will grow our ability to export cleanly generated electrons to hungry energy markets in neighboring states and import thousands of good-paying jobs and billions of dollars of private investment back into our communities.”

“The largest wind power project in the entire country is now producing strong benefits for the state of New Mexico including millions of dollars in tax revenue to local counties and school districts” said Mike Garland CEO of Pattern Energy. “This is just the beginning. We have committed to $6 billion in upcoming wind energy and related infrastructure projects in New Mexico over the next decade putting thousands of people to work. Together we are building a cleaner and more sustainable future.”

Western Spirit Wind will provide clean renewable energy to California and New Mexico through long-term power purchase agreements with the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power San José Clean Energy East Bay Community Energy California Choice Energy Authority and member cities and international energy company Uniper Global Commodities which provides power to local New Mexicans.

“If we’re going to make this decade one of exponential climate action we need more than just bold goals and lofty long-term promises — we need real solutions and results today” said Mayor Eric Garcetti. “Bringing this state-of-the-art facility online makes it our largest wind project to date — providing clean energy for hundreds of thousands of Angelenos and bringing us one major step closer to becoming a city powered without fossil fuels.”

“The energy we receive from Western Spirit will power 186000 San José homes annually with clean pollution-free electricity for the next 15 years” said San José Mayor Sam Liccardo. “I’m proud that San José Clean Energy is helping invest in California’s renewable energy future so we can leave a more livable planet to future generations.”

The four wind power facilities that comprise Western Spirit Wind utilize a total of 377 GE wind turbines ranging from 2.3 to 2.8 MW in size. The GE turbines utilize various tower heights to optimize the wind capture at each facility. Blattner Energy was the EPC Contractor for the four wind facilities.

The wind project and accompanying transmission line involved approximately 1500 workers on-site during peak construction including heavy equipment operators electricians laborers and others. Going forward more than 50 workers will operate and maintain the Western Spirit Wind facilities in New Mexico.

Western Spirit Wind will have far-reaching economic benefits for the local area and is projected to provide an estimated $3 million per year for the three counties and two school districts in the project area. Stable long-term funding directly contributes to improved quality of education services roads and first responder capabilities for the entire community.

The power generated by Western Spirit Wind has a complementary generation profile to solar and typically delivers power around the clock. The power produced by the facility will provide resource diversification to western energy markets to help meet customer demand during the crucial early evening hours when demand is high but otherwise available renewable energy supply is typically low.

The Western Spirit Transmission line which enabled the suite of Western Spirit Wind projects to be connected to the grid was developed jointly by Pattern Energy and the New Mexico Renewable Energy Transmission Authority (RETA). The 155-mile 345 kV transmission line completed in December is delivering wind power from Western Spirit Wind in central New Mexico to the electric grid managed by Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM) near Albuquerque. PNM now owns and will operate the transmission line. The transmission line was constructed by EC Source a MasTec Company.

Here's what's at stake.,"CNN —

The Environmental Protection Agency faces a Supreme Court case on Monday that could deal a significant blow to the federal government’s ability to fight the climate crisis and prevent its worst outcomes.

Republican attorneys general will argue the EPA has no authority to regulate planet-warming emissions from the power sector. Instead they will say that authority should be given to Congress.

The case also has enormous implications for Biden’s climate agenda. With legislative action on climate looking uncertain at best a Supreme Court decision siding with coal companies could undercut an important way the administration planned to slash emissions at a moment when scientists are sounding alarms about the accelerating pace of global warming.

The power sector is the country’s second-largest emitter of greenhouse gas. Power emissions rose last year mainly driven by coal.

Experts say West Virginia v. EPA is a highly unusual case because there is no current EPA rule on power plant emissions. Plaintiffs are asking the court to block the EPA from implementing future rules.

“All of this feels quite unprecedented” Jody Freeman a Harvard Law School professor and former Obama administration official told CNN.

Here’s what you need to know about the case and its possible outcomes.

Who brought the lawsuit and what do they want?

West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey is the main plaintiff in this case joined by Republican attorneys general from more than a dozen other states. Morrisey’s office is also representing two coal companies: The North American Coal Corporation and Westmoreland Mining Holdings LLC.

The plaintiffs are challenging the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions coming from power plants and saying this power should be taken away from the agency and given to Congress.

“I think this is really about a fundamental question of who decides the major issues of the day” Morrisey said at a media event earlier this month. “Should it be unelected bureaucrats or should it be the people’s representatives in Congress? That’s what this case is all about.”

US power plants have historically generated electricity by burning coal; however coal use is declining as renewables and natural gas have grown in the power sector.

West Virginia and several other plaintiff states are also coal mining states.

What do the defendants say?

The US Solicitor General is representing the Biden administration and the EPA. Several environmental groups Democratic lawmakers power companies and their trade association have filed amicus briefs in support of the defendants.

The Biden administration says the case should be dismissed in large part because there is no federal regulation for power plants on the books right now. The Obama-era Clean Power Plan is long dead as is the Trump-era Affordable Clean Energy rule that replaced it.

President Joe Biden’s EPA hasn’t yet issued its own rule to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and is expected to do so after February 28 oral arguments.

“Normally courts review actual regulations and there is no regulation to review right now” New York University law professor and environmental law expert Ricky Revesz told CNN. “Whatever the court does will involve speculation and courts don’t normally – they stress this – give advisory opinions. That’s not what courts do.”

Who else is involved?

In an interesting twist some power companies are siding with EPA and will have the opportunity to argue their case directly during oral arguments.

The power sector is very nervous about the implications of repealing the EPA’s regulatory authority. In its amicus brief the industry’s powerful trade group Edison Electric Institute said that stripping EPA of its authority “would be chaos” for its companies and open them up to constant litigation.

“Instead of EPA utilizing its world of expert authority to craft regulations our members would be thrown into a world of tort and nuisance suits” Alex Bond deputy general counsel for climate and clean energy at EEI told CNN. “That’s a world of tremendous risk and uncertainty.”

Legal experts and environmental groups are watching to see whether this argument from the power industry could strike a chord with conservative justices.

“I think the court is attentive to business” said Freeman. “It is striking that the industry that is the one to be regulated is not the petitioner.”

What’s being argued?

The things being argued in front of the Supreme Court are quite broad.

Morrisey and other plaintiffs say the Clean Air Act doesn’t explicitly say the EPA can regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. But rather than asking for limits on EPA’s authority are urging the Supreme Court to invoke two legal theories which would in effect give Congress the power to make decisions about regulating power plant emissions instead of agencies.

“These federal agencies don’t have the ability to act on their own without getting a clear statement from Congress” Morrisey said at the media event. “If you have something that’s major you have to make sure Congress steps in and Congress gets to make these major decisions of the day.”

But legal experts say Congress already used its broad delegation power with the Clean Air Act which has been reaffirmed by the Supreme Court itself. In two separate rulings – one of them unanimous – the Supreme Court found the EPA does have the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions (Massachusetts v. EPA and American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut).

In addition delegating this power to an already slow-moving branch of government could present an obvious logistical challenge.

“On the surface it sounds like a reasonable thing to say: Congress should speak clearly” said Freeman. “But historically in practice we have taken ‘broad delegation’ as just that – broad delegation” to the agencies to make decisions.

What are the range of outcomes?

The conservative supermajority makes the outcome of this case tough to predict but there are a few possibilities.

Case dismissal: In its brief the US Solicitor General’s Office asks the Supreme Court to dismiss the case saying the Republican state attorneys general and coal companies lack standing because there’s no EPA regulation currently in effect.

Administration lawyers are also proposing the court could vacate and nullify the DC Circuit Court’s January 2021 ruling that spurred West Virginia’s challenge. In effect that could wipe the slate clean and allow Biden’s EPA to proceed with its own power plant rules.

A narrow ruling: The court could issue a narrower ruling that allows EPA to keep its authority to regulate but says the agency can only issue rulings that impacts power companies “inside the fence.” This would restrict EPA to narrower regulations that power plants could achieve inside their own fence lines – like carbon capture – rather than pushing them to add cleaner sources of energy.

EPA’s worst-case scenario: The court could overturn Massachusetts v. EPA and give the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants to Congress.

Are there justices to watch?

Most of the action will be on the court’s conservative bench.

Defendants plaintiffs and outside experts say they’ll be watching the court’s newest justices: Amy Coney Barrett Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. Barrett is a bit of an unknown when it comes to environmental law experts told CNN.

“I think everybody’s bet is she would tend to be more skeptical of broad agency authority” Freeman said."

The hits keep coming for Phil Mickelson.

According to a report on Saturday from The Palm Springs Desert Sun Mickelson will no longer serve as host of The American Express in the wake of his recent comments about the proposed Saudi golf league. The PGA Tour confirmed to The Desert Sun that Mickelson who has hosted the event since 2020 will not return to that role in 2023. Additionally the Mickelson Foundation reportedly will no longer be involved with the event.

The move to oust Mickelson as host of The American Express comes on the heels of other sponsors ending their business partnerships with the six-time major winner over the past week. Callaway Mickelson’s longtime equipment partner announced on Friday they were “pausing” their relationship with the 51-year-old while other sponsors including KPMG Workday and Heineken have opted to end their deals as well.

“Callaway does not condone Phil Mickelson’s comments and we were very disappointed in his choice of words — they in no way reflect our values or what we stand for as a company” Callaway said in a statement. “Phil has apologized and we know he regrets how he handled recent events. We recognize his desire to take time away from the game and respect that decision. At this time we have agreed to pause our partnership and will re-evaluate our ongoing relationship at a later date.”

Mickelson’s thoughts on the Saudi league came to light in an excerpt for a forthcoming biography by Alan Shipnuck titled Phil: The Rip-Roaring (and Unauthorized!) Biography of Golf’s Most Colorful Superstar published Feb. 17 on FirePitCollective.com. In the excerpt Lefty admits to getting involved with the Saudi league in an effort to strong-arm the Tour into a more player-friendly media rights deal.

The comments made waves across the golf world with several of the game’s biggest stars speaking out at last week’s Genesis Invitational. Shorty thereafter Mickelson issued an apology and stated his intentions to take time away from the game.

“Although it doesn’t look this way now given my recent comments my actions throughout this process have always been with the best interest of golf my peers sponsors and fans” Mickelson’s statement read. “There is the problem of off record comments being shared out of context and without my consent but the bigger issue is that I used words I sincerely regret that do not reflect my true feelings or intentions.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL2dvbGYvc3RvcnkvXy9pZC8zMzM3ODM5Mi90aGUtYW1lcmljYW4tZXhwcmVzcy1ldmVudC1wZ2EtdG91ci1uby1sb25nZXItcGhpbC1taWNrZWxzb24tc2VydmUtaG9zdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The American Express event on the PGA Tour will no longer have Phil Mickelson serve as host,"Phil Mickelson's controversial comments about the PGA Tour and organizers of a Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway league continue to create backlash as the six-time major champion will no longer serve as host of The American Express event in La Quinta California.

The PGA Tour on Saturday told The Desert Sun that in addition to Mickelson not returning as host in January 2023 the Mickelson Foundation will no longer be the charitable arm of the event.

On Friday it was announced that Callaway Golf paused its relationship with Mickelson while Workday ended its sponsorship with him. Two other sponsors KPMG and Amstel Light cut ties with Mickelson earlier in the week.

Author Alan Shipnuck released an excerpt from his upcoming unauthorized biography of Mickelson last week. In it Mickelson described the Saudis as ""scary"" but said he was looking past their controversial history of human rights violations to gain leverage with the PGA Tour.

His comments drew widespread criticism -- including from fellow PGA Tour players -- leading Mickelson to apologize days later.

""Although it doesn't look this way now given my recent comments my actions throughout this process have always been with the best interests of golf my peers sponsors and fans"" Mickelson wrote. ""There is the problem of off-the-record comments being shared out of context and without my consent but the bigger issue is that I used words that do not reflect my true feelings or intentions.

""It was reckless I offended people and I am deeply sorry for my choice of words. I'm beyond disappointed and will make every effort to self-reflect and learn from this.""

He added that he was taking time away from golf ""to prioritize the ones I love most and to work on being the man I want to be.""

On the ""Fire Pit Collective"" podcast Shipnuck said Mickelson reached out to him to discuss the PGA Tour and other issues in November. Shipnuck said Mickelson never said their discussion was off the record or for background purposes only and knew it would be used in his book.

""I have made a lot of mistakes in my life and many have been shared with the public"" Mickelson wrote as part of his statement. ""My intent was never to hurt anyone and I'm sorry to the people I have negatively impacted. This has always been about supporting the players and I appreciate all the people who have given me the benefit of doubt.""

Mickelson 51 had served as host of The American Express event since 2020.

Last month American Express extended its title sponsorship deal with the event through 2028. According to The Desert Sun the event has resulted in $68 million being distributed to local charities since it debuted in 1960.

ESPN's Mark Schlabach contributed to this report.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzAyLzI2L3BoaWwtbWlja2Vsc29uLWRyb3BwZWQtYXMtaG9zdC1vZi10aGUtYW1lcmljYW4tZXhwcmVzcy1ldmVudC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Phil Mickelson dropped as host of The American Express event amid Saudi controversy,"Phil Mickelson continues to bleed endorsements. The American Express event in La Quinta Calif. dropped him as a host on Saturday.

Additionally the PGA Tour told The Desert Sun of Palm Springs that the Mickelson Foundation will no longer be the charitable arm of the event. The foundation which was formed specifically to fill that role had a contract with the American Express event through 2024.

The American Express event is the fifth sponsor to change its relationship with Mickelson following comments he made about the proposed Saudi Arabian-backed breakaway league. Mickelson said he didn’t care about the human rights violations of the regime so long as it gave him leverage over the PGA Tour. Callaway Golf paused its relationship with Mickelson. Workday KPMG and Amstel Light all cut ties with him.

Mickelson’s comments seem to have upended the Saudi league’s chances of successfully poaching top PGA talent and drew widespread criticism. Mickelson apologized in a long-winded statement after the initial comments made last November to Alan Shipnuck were made public.

“Although it doesn’t look this way now given my recent comments my actions throughout this process have always been with the best interests of golf my peers sponsors and fans” Mickelson said in his apology.

He also claimed the conversation with Shipnuck was off the record a claim Shipnuck called false.

Mickelson is now taking time away from golf as he waits for the backlash to boil over.

According to The Desert Sun the tournament’s status is not in danger though it will need to find a new host for its charitable arm.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc2VydHN1bi5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL2dvbGYvMjAyMi8wMi8yNi9hbWVyaWNhbi1leHByZXNzLXBoaWwtbWlja2Vsc29uLW91dC1wZ2EtdG91ci1ldmVudC1ob3N0LzY5NTMzNzYwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Express: Phil Mickelson out as PGA Tour event host,"In the wake of his controversial comments about a proposed Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway golf league and his perceived problems with the PGA Tour Phil Mickelson will no longer serve as host of The American Express PGA Tour event in La Quinta.

The PGA Tour confirmed to The Desert Sun on Saturday that Mickelson who served as tournament host since 2020 will not return to that role in 2023. In addition the Mickelson Foundation formed in 2019 specifically to be the charitable arm of the tournament will no longer be part of the event the tour confirmed. The foundation's contract with the tournament was to run through 2024.

Tour officials declined comment on any other matters over Mickelson's departure.

Mickelson a Hall of Fame golfer and winner of 45 PGA Tour events and six major championships has been a fixture in the desert and at the tournament. Mickelson a 19-time tournament participant since his desert debut in 1993 has won twice in 2002 and 2004. He also has had a home in La Quinta in recent years.

Mickelson is among several players who have expressed interest in the rival league backed by Saudi Arabia money and headed by former player Greg Norman. But comments made by Mickelson to writer Alan Shipnuck for an upcoming book about his reasons for dealing with the Saudi tour sparked a firestorm of backlash in the last week.

“They're scary (bleeps) to get involved with"" Mickelson said to Shipnuck who is writing a biography on Mickelson due out this spring. “We know they killed [Washington Post reporter and U.S. resident Jamal] Khashoggi and have a horrible record on human rights. They execute people over there for being gay. Knowing all of this why would I even consider it? Because this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape how the PGA Tour operates.”

Apology followed by more fallout

After several days of silence following the quotes Mickelson issued an apology for his comments while reiterating his belief the structure of the PGA Tour needs to change. Mickelson also said he believed that the comments were off the record.

""My actions throughout this process have always been with the best interest of golf my peers sponsors and fans"" Mickelson said in his statement earlier this week. ""I used words I sincerely regret that do not reflect my true feelings or intentions. It was reckless I offended people and I am deeply sorry for my choice of words.""

Since Mickelson’s apology long-time sponsors of the 51-year-old Mickelson such as KPMG and Workday have severed tied with the World Golf Hall of Famer. In addition equipment manufacturer Callaway paused its relationship with Mickelson on Friday. Mickelson said in his apology statement that he would take an unspecified time away from the game to focus on himself his family and the people around him.

Mickelson’s departure from the Coachella Valley tournament does not endanger the long-term status of The American Express which was played for the 63rd time last month at three courses in La Quinta.

The PGA Tour has a direct contract with American Express which announced at the tournament last month an extension of its title sponsor deal through 2028. The tour will need to identify a new host organization to serve as the charitable arm of the event which has distributed $63 million to desert charities since first being played in 1960.

While the controversial comments may have hastened Mickelson’s departure from the tournament there were indications at last month’s event that Mickelson was already backing away from the tournament. Mickelson didn’t hold a pre-tournament news conference early in the week as he had the previous two years and he did not hand out the trophy to winner Hudson Swafford after the final round.

La Quinta Mayor Linda Evans who is also a board member of the Mickelson Foundation said she had no information about the tournament changes. She added she knows that American Express and the PGA Tour are committed to the La Quinta event no matter what organization is operating the event and that her focus is on trying to raise funds for local charities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZkaWdlc3QuY29tL3N0b3J5L1BoaWwtbWlja2Vsc29uLXJlcHJvdGVkbHktb3V0LWFzLWhvc3Qtb2YtdGhlLWFtZXJpY2FuLWV4cHJlc3MtaW4tcGFsbS1kZXNlcnTSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb2xmZGlnZXN0LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9QaGlsLW1pY2tlbHNvbi1yZXByb3RlZGx5LW91dC1hcy1ob3N0LW9mLXRoZS1hbWVyaWNhbi1leHByZXNzLWluLXBhbG0tZGVzZXJ0L2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Report: Phil Mickelson out as host of The American Express,Phil Mickelson is out as host of The American Express that is played each January in California's Coachella Valley.

The onetime organizer of the International Solidarity Movement a pro-Palestinian group that recognizes the right to “legitimate armed struggle” against the Israeli occupation Huwaida Arraf has alarmed Detroit-area Jewish and pro-Israel groups with her plans to enter a crowded Democratic field ahead in the August 2022 primary in Michigan’s 10th Congressional District.

Rabbi Asher Lopatin executive director of the Michigan-based Jewish Community Relations Council of the American Jewish Committee called Arraf’s past statements about Israel “hateful destructive and antisemitic.”

For her part Arraf has condemned antisemitism in pro-Palestinian advocacy and says she encourages Jews to approach her with any questions and not to believe everything they read about her.

“Know that I will always stand for people’s rights” she said. “And when we come together to defend the rights of all people — not really based on ethnicity or religion — we will find ourselves on the same side.”

Her positions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict however are well beyond the consensus of even most Jewish left-of-center groups which consider terms like “genocide” to describe the conflict not only inaccurate but antisemitic.

In an interview with the Jewish Telegraphic Agency Arraf 45 noted that she had signed a statement denouncing antisemitism in the struggle for Palestinian rights.

At the same time Arraf agrees with many pro-Palestinian talking points that have been deemed antisemitic by Israel and numerous Jewish groups including the “genocide” charge. She told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency last year that while she once shied away from characterizing what was happening to Palestinians as genocide because it would not lead to productive conversation she has reconsidered more recently.

Asked how she could justify the term “genocide” when the Palestinian population in the West Bank and Gaza has increased from 1 million in 1948 to almost 4 million today Arraf said it’s a genocide of a different kind.

“It absolutely needs to be looked into whether Israel is committing genocide” Arraf said. “It’s not just about getting rid of the numbers of people; it is about erasing people’s identity. There are different forms of genocide. You have social genocide and you have the traditional meaning of genocide — when we understand that there are mass killings to completely annihilate people. But it is not the only form.”

Lopatin is unequivocal in labeling Arraf’s statements “antisemitic.” He said that while his organization is nonpartisan “we believe Ms. Arraf should be seen as a wholly unacceptable candidate for the Democratic Party for Michigan and the 10th District. Sadly her anti-Israel activism does no good for the cause of those in her district nor even to the cause of the Palestinian people. Venomous anti-Zionism has no place in American politics and should be condemned by all no matter what their political leanings.”

Were she to win Arraf would join Rep. Rashida Tlaib as the second Michigan congresswoman to hold deeply critical views of Israel. But a victory for Arraf is a long shot according to Adrian Hemond CEO of Grassroots Midwest a Michigan political consulting firm.

The district in which Arraf is running was recently redrawn so there is no incumbent in the district where a sizable Jewish population resides in the Rochester and Rochester Hills suburbs of Detroit Hemond said. Many candidates are expected to throw their hats into the ring.

“I expect a crowded Democratic primary and a high-quality Republican on the other side if she comes through” Hemond said. “The district partisan base is essentially 50-50. I’d rate her winning chances as quite low overall.”

So far though only two Democrats have officially declared their candidacy and of them only Arraf has raised any funds. She pulled in more than $200000 before December 31 2021 according to federal elections data.

If she does prevail through two rounds of voting Arraf 45 would cut a remarkable profile in Congress.

The daughter of two Palestinian Christian parents — her mother came from Beit Sahour in the West Bank and her father was a Palestinian citizen of Israel — she was born in Detroit shortly after her parents immigrated to the United States. She majored in Arabic studies Judaic studies and political science at the University of Michigan. She said she wanted to expose herself to all points of view.

“I was thinking at the time maybe I can get into diplomacy and try to play a role in bringing the two sides together” Arraf said. “And then if I was going to do that I’d want to obviously understand the Israeli side better” including learning Hebrew.

As part of her early quest for understanding Arraf lived on a kibbutz in Israel something that she was able to do as an Israeli citizen. “I cherish that time” she said. When she returned to the University of Michigan she established a Jewish-Palestinian dialogue group.

That led her to her move to Jerusalem as program coordinator for Seeds of Peace which at the time focused on bringing Jews and Arab youth from the Middle East together for dialogue. Arraf enjoyed arranging the encounters and through the organization she met Adam Shapiro the group’s Jewish acting director at the time.

After working together for a year including on curfew-defying missions to deliver bread to Beit Jala the pair began dating and married in 2002. They have two children and frequently join Shapiro’s family to celebrate Jewish holidays.

Yet the experience essentially ended her ambitions to become a diplomat: Arraf concluded that Seeds of Peace was a “feel-good project” that ultimately harms the pro-Palestinian cause.

“When we bring them together we’re falsely creating a level playing field” Arraf said. “But then the Israelis are going back to their cities or towns and the Palestinians are winding their way around through checkpoints under the gun of someone who’s probably the brother or sister of their new Israeli best friend. And what are we actually doing about that? Nothing.”

These feelings solidified during the Second Intifada when more than 1100 Israelis and 5500 Palestinians were killed in violent clashes in the territories and a rash of terrorist attacks inside Israel. Arraf resigned from Seeds of Peace.

That’s when she and her husband cofounded the International Solidarity Movement a group that urges “nonviolent” resistance against the Israeli occupation yet also says it recognizes the right to “legitimate armed struggle.” The Israeli government accused members of the group of illegal and violent actions against Israeli soldiers and operating in cooperation with Palestinian terrorist organizations.

It was not long after the group’s founding that Rachel Corrie a 23-year-old American International Solidarity Movement activist was killed in Gaza while attempting to block an Israeli army bulldozer that was engaged in a home demolition operation. An Israeli court absolved the driver. (Another volunteer with the group would be fatally shot the following year.) Corrie’s death became a political and cultural touchstone for pro-Palestinian activists.

Arraf traveled to Corrie’s brother’s home immediately after her death and has remained close with the Corrie family since speaking at an event commemorating the 15th anniversary of her death in 2018.

There she said her immediate response to Corrie’s death was “this feeling of immense responsibility in that I was part of calling Rachel over so it should have been me and not her under that bulldozer.” (She had been in the United States at the time but as an Israeli citizen she was also not able to enter Gaza.)

After graduating from law school at American University in 2007 Arraf embarked on a legal career that has included consulting with a human rights clinic at Al-Quds University in East Jerusalem and working on civil rights cases in New York and Michigan.

She also chaired the Free Gaza Movement which in 2008 and 2010 organized ships to try to evade the Israeli naval blockade of Gaza. After a surprising success in 2008 about 700 pro-Palestinian activists took part in the 2010 “Gaza Freedom Flotilla” which ended when Israeli commandoes raided one of the boats the Mavi Marmara.

Nine activists were killed on the Turkish vessel and Israel later said that it identified five passengers with terrorist connections. Relations between Israel and Turkey broke down in the aftermath of the incident.

“I wish I would have had the opportunity to do more training with the passengers before we departed so that they would know what to expect” Arraf told JTA recently.

“I don’t know if that would have changed anything but knowing what to expect generally helps calm fears. I remember thinking when shots first rang out — I was on the Challenger but noticed the Marmara surrounded — ‘I’m used to this but they must be terrified.’”

In the wake of the incident Israel’s security cabinet voted to ease import restrictions on civilian goods entering the country through other border crossings but maintained the naval blockade of the Gaza Strip. Arraf and several others left Free Gaza’s leadership in September 2012; she resigned completely she said later that year over antisemitism in the group’s ranks.

A cofounder of Free Gaza Greta Berlin tweeted that “Zionists” were guilty of operating Nazi concentration camps in an episode that drew widespread attention and rebuke. Arraf and others openly denounced Berlin’s tweet and subsequent behavior at the time saying that the Free Gaza Movement never tolerated antisemitism.

“She said it was a mistake but instead of immediately removing it she tried to justify/defend her actions which just made things worse” Arraf said in an email to JTA. “I and other board members felt that we had to put out a statement distancing ourselves from this. And while I was already planning on resigning this incident just sped up the resignation.”

Arraf said she is not running on her record as a Palestinian activist but she hopes that as the daughter of immigrants she can find voters through issues that have traditionally attracted Democrats.

“I’m running for Congress because I believe every Michigan family wants essentially the same thing” Arraf said. “You have to be able to live a good life to have a decent job with a livable wage where people feel that they are respected and treated well that our children have quality schools that we have safe neighborhoods that we have a resilient infrastructure and healthy communities.”

Of course members of Congress deal frequently with issues related to Israel. Arraf said she would condemn a terrorist attack on an Israeli noncombatant but would not vote in favor of US funding for Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense weapons.

“It is voting against enabling Israel to continue its offensive against the Palestinian people” she explained. “Because when Israel doesn’t have to worry about shoring up its capabilities it frees up other resources for Israel to go in and do whatever they want.”

On the status of Jerusalem Arraf has studied Judaism and understands the centrality of the city. But she said it’s an important city to her too as a Christian Palestinian.

“Why can’t the city be central to Judaism as part of a country where everybody is equal? We want to dismantle the colonialism and create a system that works for everybody so that anybody that has an attachment to Jerusalem or to any part of that land that wants to live there can live there according to laws that apply to everybody.”

Running as a progressive Arraf says she holds positions that many American Jews support.

“I definitely know the history that the Jewish community has in fighting for social justice” she said “which is why it’s perplexing a little bit frustrating in almost every other issue they’re on the right side but when it comes to Palestinian rights there is this block in that Israel takes over.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmljaWoub3JnL2ludmVzdGlnYXRpb25zL2VyaWNzc29uLWxpc3QvZXJpY3Nzb24tbGVhay1pc2lzLWlyYXEtY29ycnVwdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leak exposes Ericsson’s secret dealings with ISIS amid Iraq corruption spree,"Telecom giant Ericsson sought permission from the terrorist group known as the Islamic State to work in an ISIS-controlled city and paid to smuggle equipment into ISIS areas on a route known as the “Speedway” according to a leaked internal investigation report obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.

The report reveals that the Swedish-based firm made tens of millions of dollars in suspicious payments over nearly a decade to sustain its business in Iraq financing slush funds trips abroad for defense officials and payoffs through middlemen to corporate executives and possibly terrorists.

The internal investigation describes a pattern of bribery and corruption so widespread and company oversight so weak that millions of dollars in payments couldn’t be accounted for – all while Ericsson worked to maintain and expand vital cellular networks in one of the most corrupt countries in the world. The review which has not been made public covers the years 2011 to 2019.

Ericsson’s business in Iraq relied on politically connected fixers and unvetted subcontractors. It was marked by sham contracts inflated invoices falsified financial statements and payments to “consultants” with nebulous job descriptions. In one instance a member of a powerful Kurdish family the Barzanis collected $1.2 million for “facilitation to the chairman” of a mobile phone operator — also a Barzani the report says.

Most of the corrupt conduct came after Ericsson a key actor in the West’s battle with China over the future of global communications acknowledged in 2013 that it was cooperating with U.S. authorities investigating bribery allegations elsewhere. The U.S. probe resulted in a $1 billion bribery settlement in 2019 with the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The settlement does not mention Iraq.

ICIJ shared the leaked records with The Washington Post SVT in Sweden and 28 other media partners in 22 countries as part of a project known as the Ericsson List. ICIJ and its partners verified the records’ authenticity and spent months examining other documents and interviewing ex-employees government officials contractors and other industry insiders in Iraq London Washington Jordan Lebanon and elsewhere.

The leaked documents include 73 pages of a 79-page report on Ericsson’s Iraq business including summaries of 28 witness interviews and 22.5 million emails.

ICIJ and partnering news organizations sent detailed questions to Ericsson about the secret internal review. Instead of answering Ericsson issued a public statement on Feb. 15 acknowledging “corruption-related misconduct” in Iraq and possible payments to ISIS.

Ericsson CEO Börje Ekholm also granted interviews to news outlets not in possession of the leaked documents. He said that Ericsson may have made illicit payments but that the company had often struggled to identify the final beneficiary.

“We can’t determine where money sometimes really goes but we can see that it has disappeared” Ekholm told a Swedish newspaper.

Ericsson cited its “commitment to transparency” in its recent disclosures. But the company made no mention of other internal probes described in the leaked documents.

In 2019 Ericsson admitted to bribery and corrupt business practices in five countries that took place over a 17-year period in a $1 billion agreement with U.S. authorities — one of the largest foreign corruption settlements in history. Leaked internal documents show that in 2019 Ericsson itself examined employees’ alleged corrupt practices in 15 countries dating back to 2011. Aside from China none of these countries were covered in Ericsson’s billion-dollar settlement with U.S. prosecutors. The documents show that Ericsson made tens of millions of dollars in suspicious payments in Iraq — financing bribery slush funds payoffs and more — as well as payments tied to business in Lebanon and Portugal.

The records show that besides Iraq the company examined alleged misconduct in Lebanon Spain Portugal and Egypt. In addition a spreadsheet lists company probes into possible bribery money laundering and embezzlement by employees in Angola Azerbaijan Bahrain Brazil China Croatia Libya Morocco the United States and South Africa. These probes have not been previously disclosed.

A 2014 decision stands as pivotal for Ericsson in Iraq. As ISIS conquered towns pillaged homes and beheaded hostages two employees proposed halting operations in Mosul and elsewhere in the country. Senior regional executives rejected the recommendation. Leaving would “destroy our business” the report quotes the executives as saying.

Less than a month later Ericsson asked a regional partner Asiacell Communications to seek “permission from ‘local authority ISIS’” to continue work in Mosul leading to gun-toting ISIS fighters kidnapping a crew chief with an Ericsson subcontractor according to the report and the kidnap victim. Asiacell didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment.

Ericsson’s investigators said they could not rule out the possibility that the company financed terrorism through its subcontractors though they couldn’t identify any Ericsson employee as “directly involved.”

Ericsson’s compliance department which monitors the transnational company’s activities prepared the confidential records with the help of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett a high-powered New York law firm which handled its defense in the U.S. bribery probe.

The internal review while damning often fails to reach specific conclusions and suggests an incomplete investigation into some of the most explosive allegations including that payments were made to terrorists. Internal investigators didn’t interview officials of either the main transport firm moving Ericsson equipment through ISIS territory or the subcontractors the company relied on to work in ISIS-held Mosul for example.

Questions from ICIJ and its partners that Ericsson has refused to address include why a regional executive was promoted during the corruption probe and why workers’ lives were put at risk by company operations in Iraq.

It is not clear how much the U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission knew about abuses in Iraq or whether Ericsson fully disclosed its internal findings to the agencies. The Justice Department and SEC declined to comment on any aspect of the Ericsson case. Simpson Thacher did not respond to requests for comment.

Ekholm told Reuters the 2019 settlement “limits our ability to comment on what is disclosed or not disclosed.”

He said the company chose not to disclose the Iraq probe because “the materiality of our findings did not pass our threshold to make a disclosure.”

Ericsson’s share value plunged $4.4 billion or more than 10% the day after Ekholm’s admission that the company might have paid ISIS.

Law firms soon began to solicit Ericsson investors for a possible lawsuit alleging that the company withheld “material information” about possible payments to militants.

In a news release the company said that it was “committed to conducting business in a responsible manner applying ethical standards in anti-corruption humanitarian and human rights terms.”

‘Bribes kickbacks and embezzlement’

The internal report alleges that at least 10 current and former employees violated Ericsson’s ethics code. Among the “breaches” identified by the report were bribery fraud money laundering and obstruction of the investigation.

Ericsson showered clients with artwork clothes and other perks like iPads watches and Mont Blanc pens the report says. It paid for trips to Spain and Sweden for 10 Iraqi defense ministry officials.

In its recent news release Ericsson said that it had taken disciplinary actions and that several employees had left the company as a result of the investigation. But other employees implicated in misconduct remain at Ericsson. At least one was promoted.

Investigators found that Elie Moubarak Ericsson’s account manager for Korek Telecom a mobile phone carrier and the company’s largest customer in Iraq engaged in “corruption and financial irregularities.”

In one instance Moubarak asked for a $50000 “donation” to Kurdistan’s Peshmerga forces “for fighting ISIS” the report says. The militia was led by Sirwan Barzani also a major shareholder of Korek and board chairman at the time. The official request indicated that the donation was to benefit refugees and displaced children in Kurdistan the report says.

Rafiah Ibrahim the company executive in charge of the Middle East and Africa endorsed the donation to “try to get mileage from the Korek chairman” the report says. Ericsson funneled the money through a charitable group. Internal investigators couldn’t identify the ultimate beneficiaries.

Ibrahim was named a senior vice president and member of the executive team under Ekholm in 2017 and she became an adviser to Ekholm in 2019. Moubarak was promoted to country manager of Iraq in 2019. Neither Ibrahim nor Moubarak responded to requests for comment.

A business vulnerable to bribery

Ericsson’s problems in Iraq illustrate the risk of corruption in the $1.6 trillion telecom industry. Large profits can flow from government licenses and telecom equipment contracts and anti-bribery enforcement is weak. Conducting business in Iraq “may in itself pose significant political financial and legal risks and requires diligent controls” the internal review says.

The investigation also calls attention to the Justice Department’s handling of corporate crime. The billion-dollar settlement with Ericsson in 2019 was one of the largest ever and the company admitted to engaging in bribery and other misconduct in Djibouti China Vietnam Indonesia and Kuwait from 2000 to 2016.

Under the deal known as a deferred prosecution agreement Ericsson avoided a criminal trial and none of its top executives were held accountable. The U.S. government reserves the right to bring charges if it decides that Ericsson hasn’t lived up to the terms of the deal including disclosing allegations of wrongdoing.

Critics say such deals negotiated by prosecutors and corporate defense lawyers behind closed doors protect top executives from criminal prosecution and do not provide effective punishment. Innocent shareholders suffer they say instead of guilty executives.

In October Ericsson said it received notice from the Justice Department that it had violated its plea deal “by failing to provide certain documents and factual information.” Ekholm told a Swedish newspaper that the violation wasn’t related to Iraq.

Local start global battleground

Officially known as Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson the company generates annual revenue of $25 billion and has roughly 100000 employees in more than 140 countries. It is a leading supplier of towers radio base stations and mobile switching centers — the foundation of modern communications.

Ericsson traces its origins to 1876 when Lars Magnus Ericsson a farmer’s son opened a telegraph repair shop in Stockholm. The company went on to pioneer automated telephone switching international calling mobile telephones and in the 1990s the mobile internet.

After a string of corporate scandals and bad business bets in the 2000s Western telecom companies including Ericsson lost ground to new Chinese equipment giants including Huawei Technologies Co.

Ericsson tried to keep up by outsourcing work to local sales agents and other middlemen distancing itself from the sometimes dirty business of securing contracts and doing business in developing countries. In the case that led to the 2019 settlement the U.S. described slush funds inflated costs false invoices rigged bidding unvetted middlemen and bribery in five countries — the same pattern of behavior the internal review describes in Iraq.

In 2010 Hans Vestberg a longtime Ericsson manager became the company’s chief executive. Vestberg left in 2016 amid corruption investigations into the company and was replaced by the current chief executive Börje Ekholm.

The U.S. has favored Western mobile companies in their rivalry with Huawei warning that the Chinese company’s links to the Communist Party make it a national security threat. The race for dominance in the next generation of mobile communications known as 5G has raised the stakes. An adversary in control of the network could shut down vital systems during times of conflict U.S. officials say.

In 2020 two months after Ericsson’s corruption settlement then-U.S. Attorney General William Barr gave an unusual speech in which he suggested that the U.S. government consider buying a stake in Ericsson or another Western telecom firm Nokia. He did not mention the Ericsson case.

With contracts in many developed countries locked up the battleground for global dominance is playing out in the Middle East Africa and other fast-growing markets.

Ericsson has been a presence in Iraq since the 1960s when it helped install a telephone system in Baghdad. The dictator Saddam Hussein restricted possession of mobile phones to a tiny elite. After the U.S. invasion in 2003 Iraq emerged as one of the world’s few virgin mobile phone markets.

Ericsson won lucrative post-Iraq War contracts to supply the state-run Iraq Telecommunication and Post Co. with new technology. Ericsson also won contracts to supply towers and to upgrade equipment and networks for Iraq’s three main mobile operators: Asiacell a Qatari-owned firm; Zain Iraq part of a Kuwaiti telecom group; and Korek controlled by Sirwan Barzani who is also a nephew of the former president of Iraq’s semiautonomous Kurdistan region.

Ericsson sales in Iraq totaled about $1.9 billion from 2011 to 2018 the internal report says.

The Barzanis are a family of Kurdish oligarchs and the U.S. considers them top allies in the fight against ISIS. The internal report details several suspect transactions between Ericsson and members of the family. In one deal the report says Rasech Barzani had “no clear role” as a consultant who collected $1.2 million for offering “business intelligence and facilitation to the chairman of Korek.”

Ericsson’s report shows that Korek evaded taxes and fees amounting to $375 million and threatened to “demolish rival company towers in Kurdish territory.”

Rasech Barzani did not respond to requests for comment. Sirwan Barzani didn’t respond to questions about Korek’s relationship with Ericsson. In a statement a spokesman emphasized Barzani’s history of fighting ISIS also known as Daesh.

“After Daesh took Mosul in 2014 Sirwan Barzani rejoined the Peshmerga — stepping back from Korek — to return to the frontline to defend his country and the Western world from the threat that Daesh posed” the spokesman said.

‘Close ties pull strings’

As Ericsson’s sales agent Jawhar Surchi helped the company navigate Iraq’s bureaucracy for 15 years. Through his firm Al-Awsat Telecommunication Services Surchi secured contracts for Ericsson with government agencies and the mobile operators Asiacell and Zain.

Surchi told internal investigators that his “close ties” to people in power allowed him to “pull strings” for Ericsson and that he did “many favors” for the company helping it win contracts in “extreme times.” Ericsson couldn’t have succeeded in Iraq without his company Surchi said.

Al-Awsat which means “the middle” in Arabic was a conduit for tens of millions of dollars in suspicious payments the internal review found. Among these: $10.5 million to an Al-Awsat-linked company where the ultimate beneficiary could not be identified; and $27 million for consultancy services for which investigators found “deficient proof of work.” An audit showed that most of the money went to Surchi’s personal account in Jordan.

According to the report Al-Awsat also secretly paid for air fares for executives at Iraq’s state-owned telephone company. Al-Awsat steered work to firms owned by family members and friends the report says.

Ericsson empowered Al-Awsat to sign contracts on its behalf.

The report says Surchi’s firm over time came to be known simply as “Ericsson.”

Two senior employees told investigators that Ericsson directed $500000 in “commission” payments through Al-Awsat to Asiacell’s chief executive to win a network upgrade contract known as the Peroza Project. The project included replacing and expanding Asiacell’s network assembling telecom towers in a warehouse testing them and sending them to be installed across Iraq.

The report says Ericsson’s top Iraq executive Tarek Saadi approved the payment which was routed through Al-Awsat using two sham purchase orders each for $250000 marked as for “security services.” The report calls the Peroza Project bidding a “manipulated” selection process.

Saadi an American-educated engineer pushed his staff to issue purchase orders to Al-Awsat every month “regardless of whether there were deliveries ongoing or not” the report says.

Saadi declined to comment referring questions to Ericsson which he left in 2017. He became an adviser to Korek.

In two interviews with ICIJ partner The Washington Post Surchi acknowledged that his extensive political connections helped foreign companies compete in Iraq. “My strength was I knew the people knew all the prime ministers” he said and he listed the prime ministers by name.

He denied winning contracts through bribery or engaging in any sort of corruption and he said he never saw Ericsson do so. Of the allegations he said “Somebody is trying to discredit” the company. “Whatever is said is from jealousy.’’

A new problem: The rise of ISIS

In 2013 Ericsson acknowledged that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had opened an investigation into its business practices in Romania. A former Ericsson executive had alleged that the company used a slush fund to win contracts there by paying off officials. Over time the investigation broadened to include other countries attracting the attention of the Justice Department which joined the probe two years later.

Ericsson hired the Simpson Thacher law firm to monitor the company’s internal corruption investigations. The legal team was composed of three former U.S. officials including Cheryl Scarboro who previously served as chief of the SEC’s anti-bribery unit.

According to Swedish court records the law firm told U.S. prosecutors about a whistleblower’s allegations that Ericsson may have improperly paid more than $2 million to win a contract also sought by Huawei in Djibouti in the Horn of Africa. As the investigation progressed Ericsson’s attorneys also provided a list of the company’s outside consultants in 10 countries including Iraq according to documents reviewed by ICIJ’s Swedish partner SVT. The documents included Ericsson contracts with Al-Awsat.

As U.S. authorities ramped up the bribery probe Ericsson and its customers grappled with a new problem: the rise of ISIS a terrorist group notorious for its massacres of religious and ethnic minorities its use of chemical weapons and its public beheadings. At its peak the group ruled more than 8 million people in parts of Iraq and Syria. It also made extensive use of mobile phone technology to spread images of beheadings and to traffic sex slaves.

Ericsson and its subcontractors kept working. The day after ISIS swept into Mosul in 2014 the company was searching for contractors to work on Asiacell’s Peroza Project upgrade the internal report said.

Some employees thought that Iraq was becoming so unsafe that the company should invoke the so-called force majeure clause in its contracts. Force majeure would provide a legal defense if Ericsson stopped work because of events beyond the parties’ control.

Tom Nygren then vice president and general counsel for Ericsson in the Middle East made a “strong recommendation” to his supervisors to invoke force majeure according to the report.

Roger Antoun an Ericsson manager for Asiacell’s Peroza Project said the proposal to invoke force majeure was “escalated” to the executive office. “I raised it verbally as well” he told investigators.

Antoun would become a key figure in the internal probe after investigators determined that he had embezzled $308000 through an “uncontrolled slush fund” set up through subcontractors. The revelation triggered a wider investigation into potential payments to terrorists.

Antoun later paid the money back. Ericsson said it fired him in January 2019. Antoun declined to comment.

Saadi the company’s top Iraq executive and Rafiah Ibrahim head of the Middle East and Africa region opposed invoking force majeure the report says.

‘Abandoned’ to ISIS

A month after Ericsson’s decision to press ahead in Mosul an engineer conducting tests of cell towers as part of the Peroza Project delivered a letter to an office where ISIS had set up operations according to the engineer who asked to be identified only by his first name Affan. The letter from Ericsson and Asiacell sought permission from the terrorist group to continue working in the area he said.

In interviews the engineer who worked for a subcontractor called Orbitel Telecommunication said the three companies insisted that work continue even after ISIS detained several of his colleagues for a time. Ericsson and his supervisor told him to deliver the letter in person Affan said. Orbitel declined to comment.

Affan said an ISIS militant later called and summoned him to a bridge overpass where men with scarves hiding their faces put a hood over his head shoved him into the back seat of a Toyota pickup and took off.

One assailant a sheikh forced him to call a senior Ericsson manager in the northern city of Sulaymaniyah and then shouting at the manager threatened to blow up Ericsson’s offices Affan said. The sheikh demanded millions of dollars “for every month we worked without ISIS notification” Affan said.

The internal review confirmed the kidnapping the phone call and the demand for money.

Affan said ISIS ordered him to remain at his Mosul home until Ericsson made the payments. He said that Ericsson and the other companies abandoned him and that company employees almost immediately stopped answering his calls. A few weeks later ISIS told him that he was free to leave his house.

Emails obtained by ICIJ’s German media partner NDR confirm several details of Affan’s account.

In an interview with internal investigators an Ericsson manager said Asiacell “made arrangements to obtain the release of the hostage and to let Ericsson continue the work in Mosul.”

The report doesn’t say what the arrangements were.

In interviews with ICIJ and media partners NDR and Daraj telecom employees and contractors in Iraq said it was common knowledge that before ISIS companies paid protection money to militants to prevent attacks on their equipment and to allow workers to do their jobs.

“If your business involves money you have to pay” Affan said. “If you don’t pay they will come after you.”

‘The legal way or the Speedway’

As part of the Peroza expansion Ericsson and its partner Asiacell needed to haul cell towers and equipment from Erbil in northern Iraq to Ramadi in the middle of the country. A transportation contractor Cargo Iraq offered two options according to the report: the “legal way” and the “Speedway.”

The Speedway was actually longer — and more expensive — but it had the advantage of avoiding Iraqi customs checkpoints which were often backed up for days if not weeks.

The problem: Parts of the Speedway passed through ISIS territory.

In interviews Iraqi truck drivers and local journalists said the route was perilous. ISIS militants set up checkpoints attacking and kidnapping travelers to extort money along a 100-kilometer stretch they said.

A trucker in his 40s with two children told NDR that he transported food and other commodities via the Speedway with its ISIS checkpoints. He said he once saw a man who had been fatally shot. Nearby a truck was on fire.

“The road is isolated and terrifying and not safe” he said.

The review identified 30 trucks — mostly 40-foot rigs — that paid $3000 to $4000 per load to carry Ericsson equipment across areas held by ISIS and other militias. One table in the report shows that in March 2017 Ericsson paid $22000 per truck for three loads on a single day.

“By avoiding official customs by transporting through areas controlled by militias including ISIS it cannot be excluded that Cargo Iraq engaged in facilitation payments (to official Customs officers) bribery and potential illicit financing of terrorism to carry out transportation operations for Ericsson” the report says.

Bahez Abbas owner of Cargo Iraq denied in an interview that his company paid ISIS.

According to the report Asiacell recommended that Ericsson hire Cargo Iraq. “Evidence suggests that Asiacell have engaged in smuggling and potential illegitimate payments directly and through Ericsson” the report says.

‘Collateral consequences’

Ekholm and the company have cited the company’s commitment to integrity ethical conduct and “doing business the right way.” At an earnings call in January for example the chief executive spoke about how the company was building a “world class compliance program” and “culture of integrity.”

Keeping wraps on an internal report describing widespread corruption appears at odds with that rhetoric experts say. Ericsson “seems to have fallen short of its own and investors’ standards on anti-corruption” said Joachim Nahem a partner at The Governance Group an Oslo based research and advisory group.

As part of the deal struck with the U.S. government in 2019 the company is obligated to be more transparent — with government officials at least. Ericsson promised to report wrongdoing and submit to audits and to the scrutiny of an outside monitor for three years.

At the plea hearing a prosecutor said the U.S. didn’t indict Ericsson and allowed an Egyptian subsidiary to plead guilty instead to avoid unspecified “collateral consequences.” Ericsson remains eligible to bid on U.S. government contracts.

Only one Ericsson employee has been charged in the U.S. case. Afework Bereket was indicted last year charged with arranging more than $2 million in bribes to three officials to beat out Huawei in the competition for a contract in Djibouti. He remains at large. Bereket and three other former Ericsson employees face a criminal trial in Sweden on charges related to the Djibouti matter.

Ekholm said the company would continue to investigate what happened in Iraq.

“Thank you #Duluth for letting us know that what happens to global citizens hits home. For the remainder of the weekend we’ll be lighting Enger blue and yellow as a symbol of our community’s solidarity w the people and government of Ukraine” Larson posted on Twitter.

This comes after FOX 21’s Dan Hanger asked Larson on Friday if the iconic Lift Bridge would be lit blue and yellow. Larson said in an email that the Lift Bridge would not be lit because in the past “we were inundated w lighting requests and they are fairly subjective in nature. Enger has allowed us to accommodate a broad range of requests really well.” But Larson followed that statement Friday by saying “We do not plan to light Enger at this time but will wait for more public requests to do so – only have had a few people reach out so far.”

Hanger posted those updates to social media and apparently Larson got enough requests after that to light Enger starting Saturday night. And as for the Lift Bridge it has not been lit for any special cause or anniversary like Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month 4th of July or September 11th for about two years now — even though the city spent $155000 for a new lighting system on the bridge which can change to any color of the rainbow remotely on a computer. Duluth Council President Arik Forsman replied to FOX 21’s request for comment by saying “I am glad we are lighting up Enger tonight in solidarity and anticipate councilors and administration will discuss bridge lighting policy on Monday night. Existing policy is at the administration’s discretion. It’s great to see folks want to find ways to publicly support Ukrainians.” Forsman was referencing Monday night’s city council meeting in the quote. Meanwhile the city of Minneapolis announced Friday on its social media page that Mayor Jacob Frey was lighting up multiple buildings blue and yellow. “Bridges and buildings in Minneapolis will glow blue and yellow in a show of solidarity with Ukraine following Russia’s invasion of the nation this week. At the request of Mayor Jacob Frey and members of the City Council the Interstate 35W and Lowry Avenue bridges over the Mississippi River will be lit with Ukraine’s colors this weekend. The Capella Tower Target headquarters U.S. Bank Stadium Target Field and Nicollet Mall will also have blue and yellow lights this weekend in support of Ukrainians here in Minneapolis throughout Minnesota and abroad.”

As for Superior Mayor Jim Paine said there was no plan to light any city buildings Saturday but he released the following statement:

“As a veteran a historian and a public official I am deeply saddened and angry at Russia’s illegal and unjust invasion of Ukraine. I have personally visited Eastern Europe and have seen the tragic consequences of conflicts like this. Nobody wins these wars but millions will lose. The City of Superior will stand in strong support and solidarity with our Ukrainian citizens and we will always remain a welcome home to refugees of this conflict and any other. Слава України”

As for 6:30 p.m. Saturday FOX 21 did not have any press releases for any other Northland city turning lights blue and yellow for Ukraine.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmljaWoub3JnL2ludmVzdGlnYXRpb25zL2VyaWNzc29uLWxpc3QvZXJpY3Nzb24tbGVhay1pc2lzLWlyYXEtY29ycnVwdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Leak exposes Ericsson’s secret dealings with ISIS amid Iraq corruption spree,"Telecom giant Ericsson sought permission from the terrorist group known as the Islamic State to work in an ISIS-controlled city and paid to smuggle equipment into ISIS areas on a route known as the “Speedway” according to a leaked internal investigation report obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.

The report reveals that the Swedish-based firm made tens of millions of dollars in suspicious payments over nearly a decade to sustain its business in Iraq financing slush funds trips abroad for defense officials and payoffs through middlemen to corporate executives and possibly terrorists.

The internal investigation describes a pattern of bribery and corruption so widespread and company oversight so weak that millions of dollars in payments couldn’t be accounted for – all while Ericsson worked to maintain and expand vital cellular networks in one of the most corrupt countries in the world. The review which has not been made public covers the years 2011 to 2019.

Ericsson’s business in Iraq relied on politically connected fixers and unvetted subcontractors. It was marked by sham contracts inflated invoices falsified financial statements and payments to “consultants” with nebulous job descriptions. In one instance a member of a powerful Kurdish family the Barzanis collected $1.2 million for “facilitation to the chairman” of a mobile phone operator — also a Barzani the report says.

Most of the corrupt conduct came after Ericsson a key actor in the West’s battle with China over the future of global communications acknowledged in 2013 that it was cooperating with U.S. authorities investigating bribery allegations elsewhere. The U.S. probe resulted in a $1 billion bribery settlement in 2019 with the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The settlement does not mention Iraq.

ICIJ shared the leaked records with The Washington Post SVT in Sweden and 28 other media partners in 22 countries as part of a project known as the Ericsson List. ICIJ and its partners verified the records’ authenticity and spent months examining other documents and interviewing ex-employees government officials contractors and other industry insiders in Iraq London Washington Jordan Lebanon and elsewhere.

The leaked documents include 73 pages of a 79-page report on Ericsson’s Iraq business including summaries of 28 witness interviews and 22.5 million emails.

ICIJ and partnering news organizations sent detailed questions to Ericsson about the secret internal review. Instead of answering Ericsson issued a public statement on Feb. 15 acknowledging “corruption-related misconduct” in Iraq and possible payments to ISIS.

Ericsson CEO Börje Ekholm also granted interviews to news outlets not in possession of the leaked documents. He said that Ericsson may have made illicit payments but that the company had often struggled to identify the final beneficiary.

“We can’t determine where money sometimes really goes but we can see that it has disappeared” Ekholm told a Swedish newspaper.

Ericsson cited its “commitment to transparency” in its recent disclosures. But the company made no mention of other internal probes described in the leaked documents.

In 2019 Ericsson admitted to bribery and corrupt business practices in five countries that took place over a 17-year period in a $1 billion agreement with U.S. authorities — one of the largest foreign corruption settlements in history. Leaked internal documents show that in 2019 Ericsson itself examined employees’ alleged corrupt practices in 15 countries dating back to 2011. Aside from China none of these countries were covered in Ericsson’s billion-dollar settlement with U.S. prosecutors. The documents show that Ericsson made tens of millions of dollars in suspicious payments in Iraq — financing bribery slush funds payoffs and more — as well as payments tied to business in Lebanon and Portugal.

The records show that besides Iraq the company examined alleged misconduct in Lebanon Spain Portugal and Egypt. In addition a spreadsheet lists company probes into possible bribery money laundering and embezzlement by employees in Angola Azerbaijan Bahrain Brazil China Croatia Libya Morocco the United States and South Africa. These probes have not been previously disclosed.

A 2014 decision stands as pivotal for Ericsson in Iraq. As ISIS conquered towns pillaged homes and beheaded hostages two employees proposed halting operations in Mosul and elsewhere in the country. Senior regional executives rejected the recommendation. Leaving would “destroy our business” the report quotes the executives as saying.

Less than a month later Ericsson asked a regional partner Asiacell Communications to seek “permission from ‘local authority ISIS’” to continue work in Mosul leading to gun-toting ISIS fighters kidnapping a crew chief with an Ericsson subcontractor according to the report and the kidnap victim. Asiacell didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment.

Ericsson’s investigators said they could not rule out the possibility that the company financed terrorism through its subcontractors though they couldn’t identify any Ericsson employee as “directly involved.”

Ericsson’s compliance department which monitors the transnational company’s activities prepared the confidential records with the help of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett a high-powered New York law firm which handled its defense in the U.S. bribery probe.

The internal review while damning often fails to reach specific conclusions and suggests an incomplete investigation into some of the most explosive allegations including that payments were made to terrorists. Internal investigators didn’t interview officials of either the main transport firm moving Ericsson equipment through ISIS territory or the subcontractors the company relied on to work in ISIS-held Mosul for example.

Questions from ICIJ and its partners that Ericsson has refused to address include why a regional executive was promoted during the corruption probe and why workers’ lives were put at risk by company operations in Iraq.

It is not clear how much the U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission knew about abuses in Iraq or whether Ericsson fully disclosed its internal findings to the agencies. The Justice Department and SEC declined to comment on any aspect of the Ericsson case. Simpson Thacher did not respond to requests for comment.

Ekholm told Reuters the 2019 settlement “limits our ability to comment on what is disclosed or not disclosed.”

He said the company chose not to disclose the Iraq probe because “the materiality of our findings did not pass our threshold to make a disclosure.”

Ericsson’s share value plunged $4.4 billion or more than 10% the day after Ekholm’s admission that the company might have paid ISIS.

Law firms soon began to solicit Ericsson investors for a possible lawsuit alleging that the company withheld “material information” about possible payments to militants.

In a news release the company said that it was “committed to conducting business in a responsible manner applying ethical standards in anti-corruption humanitarian and human rights terms.”

‘Bribes kickbacks and embezzlement’

The internal report alleges that at least 10 current and former employees violated Ericsson’s ethics code. Among the “breaches” identified by the report were bribery fraud money laundering and obstruction of the investigation.

Ericsson showered clients with artwork clothes and other perks like iPads watches and Mont Blanc pens the report says. It paid for trips to Spain and Sweden for 10 Iraqi defense ministry officials.

In its recent news release Ericsson said that it had taken disciplinary actions and that several employees had left the company as a result of the investigation. But other employees implicated in misconduct remain at Ericsson. At least one was promoted.

Investigators found that Elie Moubarak Ericsson’s account manager for Korek Telecom a mobile phone carrier and the company’s largest customer in Iraq engaged in “corruption and financial irregularities.”

In one instance Moubarak asked for a $50000 “donation” to Kurdistan’s Peshmerga forces “for fighting ISIS” the report says. The militia was led by Sirwan Barzani also a major shareholder of Korek and board chairman at the time. The official request indicated that the donation was to benefit refugees and displaced children in Kurdistan the report says.

Rafiah Ibrahim the company executive in charge of the Middle East and Africa endorsed the donation to “try to get mileage from the Korek chairman” the report says. Ericsson funneled the money through a charitable group. Internal investigators couldn’t identify the ultimate beneficiaries.

Ibrahim was named a senior vice president and member of the executive team under Ekholm in 2017 and she became an adviser to Ekholm in 2019. Moubarak was promoted to country manager of Iraq in 2019. Neither Ibrahim nor Moubarak responded to requests for comment.

A business vulnerable to bribery

Ericsson’s problems in Iraq illustrate the risk of corruption in the $1.6 trillion telecom industry. Large profits can flow from government licenses and telecom equipment contracts and anti-bribery enforcement is weak. Conducting business in Iraq “may in itself pose significant political financial and legal risks and requires diligent controls” the internal review says.

The investigation also calls attention to the Justice Department’s handling of corporate crime. The billion-dollar settlement with Ericsson in 2019 was one of the largest ever and the company admitted to engaging in bribery and other misconduct in Djibouti China Vietnam Indonesia and Kuwait from 2000 to 2016.

Under the deal known as a deferred prosecution agreement Ericsson avoided a criminal trial and none of its top executives were held accountable. The U.S. government reserves the right to bring charges if it decides that Ericsson hasn’t lived up to the terms of the deal including disclosing allegations of wrongdoing.

Critics say such deals negotiated by prosecutors and corporate defense lawyers behind closed doors protect top executives from criminal prosecution and do not provide effective punishment. Innocent shareholders suffer they say instead of guilty executives.

In October Ericsson said it received notice from the Justice Department that it had violated its plea deal “by failing to provide certain documents and factual information.” Ekholm told a Swedish newspaper that the violation wasn’t related to Iraq.

Local start global battleground

Officially known as Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson the company generates annual revenue of $25 billion and has roughly 100000 employees in more than 140 countries. It is a leading supplier of towers radio base stations and mobile switching centers — the foundation of modern communications.

Ericsson traces its origins to 1876 when Lars Magnus Ericsson a farmer’s son opened a telegraph repair shop in Stockholm. The company went on to pioneer automated telephone switching international calling mobile telephones and in the 1990s the mobile internet.

After a string of corporate scandals and bad business bets in the 2000s Western telecom companies including Ericsson lost ground to new Chinese equipment giants including Huawei Technologies Co.

Ericsson tried to keep up by outsourcing work to local sales agents and other middlemen distancing itself from the sometimes dirty business of securing contracts and doing business in developing countries. In the case that led to the 2019 settlement the U.S. described slush funds inflated costs false invoices rigged bidding unvetted middlemen and bribery in five countries — the same pattern of behavior the internal review describes in Iraq.

In 2010 Hans Vestberg a longtime Ericsson manager became the company’s chief executive. Vestberg left in 2016 amid corruption investigations into the company and was replaced by the current chief executive Börje Ekholm.

The U.S. has favored Western mobile companies in their rivalry with Huawei warning that the Chinese company’s links to the Communist Party make it a national security threat. The race for dominance in the next generation of mobile communications known as 5G has raised the stakes. An adversary in control of the network could shut down vital systems during times of conflict U.S. officials say.

In 2020 two months after Ericsson’s corruption settlement then-U.S. Attorney General William Barr gave an unusual speech in which he suggested that the U.S. government consider buying a stake in Ericsson or another Western telecom firm Nokia. He did not mention the Ericsson case.

With contracts in many developed countries locked up the battleground for global dominance is playing out in the Middle East Africa and other fast-growing markets.

Ericsson has been a presence in Iraq since the 1960s when it helped install a telephone system in Baghdad. The dictator Saddam Hussein restricted possession of mobile phones to a tiny elite. After the U.S. invasion in 2003 Iraq emerged as one of the world’s few virgin mobile phone markets.

Ericsson won lucrative post-Iraq War contracts to supply the state-run Iraq Telecommunication and Post Co. with new technology. Ericsson also won contracts to supply towers and to upgrade equipment and networks for Iraq’s three main mobile operators: Asiacell a Qatari-owned firm; Zain Iraq part of a Kuwaiti telecom group; and Korek controlled by Sirwan Barzani who is also a nephew of the former president of Iraq’s semiautonomous Kurdistan region.

Ericsson sales in Iraq totaled about $1.9 billion from 2011 to 2018 the internal report says.

The Barzanis are a family of Kurdish oligarchs and the U.S. considers them top allies in the fight against ISIS. The internal report details several suspect transactions between Ericsson and members of the family. In one deal the report says Rasech Barzani had “no clear role” as a consultant who collected $1.2 million for offering “business intelligence and facilitation to the chairman of Korek.”

Ericsson’s report shows that Korek evaded taxes and fees amounting to $375 million and threatened to “demolish rival company towers in Kurdish territory.”

Rasech Barzani did not respond to requests for comment. Sirwan Barzani didn’t respond to questions about Korek’s relationship with Ericsson. In a statement a spokesman emphasized Barzani’s history of fighting ISIS also known as Daesh.

“After Daesh took Mosul in 2014 Sirwan Barzani rejoined the Peshmerga — stepping back from Korek — to return to the frontline to defend his country and the Western world from the threat that Daesh posed” the spokesman said.

‘Close ties pull strings’

As Ericsson’s sales agent Jawhar Surchi helped the company navigate Iraq’s bureaucracy for 15 years. Through his firm Al-Awsat Telecommunication Services Surchi secured contracts for Ericsson with government agencies and the mobile operators Asiacell and Zain.

Surchi told internal investigators that his “close ties” to people in power allowed him to “pull strings” for Ericsson and that he did “many favors” for the company helping it win contracts in “extreme times.” Ericsson couldn’t have succeeded in Iraq without his company Surchi said.

Al-Awsat which means “the middle” in Arabic was a conduit for tens of millions of dollars in suspicious payments the internal review found. Among these: $10.5 million to an Al-Awsat-linked company where the ultimate beneficiary could not be identified; and $27 million for consultancy services for which investigators found “deficient proof of work.” An audit showed that most of the money went to Surchi’s personal account in Jordan.

According to the report Al-Awsat also secretly paid for air fares for executives at Iraq’s state-owned telephone company. Al-Awsat steered work to firms owned by family members and friends the report says.

Ericsson empowered Al-Awsat to sign contracts on its behalf.

The report says Surchi’s firm over time came to be known simply as “Ericsson.”

Two senior employees told investigators that Ericsson directed $500000 in “commission” payments through Al-Awsat to Asiacell’s chief executive to win a network upgrade contract known as the Peroza Project. The project included replacing and expanding Asiacell’s network assembling telecom towers in a warehouse testing them and sending them to be installed across Iraq.

The report says Ericsson’s top Iraq executive Tarek Saadi approved the payment which was routed through Al-Awsat using two sham purchase orders each for $250000 marked as for “security services.” The report calls the Peroza Project bidding a “manipulated” selection process.

Saadi an American-educated engineer pushed his staff to issue purchase orders to Al-Awsat every month “regardless of whether there were deliveries ongoing or not” the report says.

Saadi declined to comment referring questions to Ericsson which he left in 2017. He became an adviser to Korek.

In two interviews with ICIJ partner The Washington Post Surchi acknowledged that his extensive political connections helped foreign companies compete in Iraq. “My strength was I knew the people knew all the prime ministers” he said and he listed the prime ministers by name.

He denied winning contracts through bribery or engaging in any sort of corruption and he said he never saw Ericsson do so. Of the allegations he said “Somebody is trying to discredit” the company. “Whatever is said is from jealousy.’’

A new problem: The rise of ISIS

In 2013 Ericsson acknowledged that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had opened an investigation into its business practices in Romania. A former Ericsson executive had alleged that the company used a slush fund to win contracts there by paying off officials. Over time the investigation broadened to include other countries attracting the attention of the Justice Department which joined the probe two years later.

Ericsson hired the Simpson Thacher law firm to monitor the company’s internal corruption investigations. The legal team was composed of three former U.S. officials including Cheryl Scarboro who previously served as chief of the SEC’s anti-bribery unit.

According to Swedish court records the law firm told U.S. prosecutors about a whistleblower’s allegations that Ericsson may have improperly paid more than $2 million to win a contract also sought by Huawei in Djibouti in the Horn of Africa. As the investigation progressed Ericsson’s attorneys also provided a list of the company’s outside consultants in 10 countries including Iraq according to documents reviewed by ICIJ’s Swedish partner SVT. The documents included Ericsson contracts with Al-Awsat.

As U.S. authorities ramped up the bribery probe Ericsson and its customers grappled with a new problem: the rise of ISIS a terrorist group notorious for its massacres of religious and ethnic minorities its use of chemical weapons and its public beheadings. At its peak the group ruled more than 8 million people in parts of Iraq and Syria. It also made extensive use of mobile phone technology to spread images of beheadings and to traffic sex slaves.

Ericsson and its subcontractors kept working. The day after ISIS swept into Mosul in 2014 the company was searching for contractors to work on Asiacell’s Peroza Project upgrade the internal report said.

Some employees thought that Iraq was becoming so unsafe that the company should invoke the so-called force majeure clause in its contracts. Force majeure would provide a legal defense if Ericsson stopped work because of events beyond the parties’ control.

Tom Nygren then vice president and general counsel for Ericsson in the Middle East made a “strong recommendation” to his supervisors to invoke force majeure according to the report.

Roger Antoun an Ericsson manager for Asiacell’s Peroza Project said the proposal to invoke force majeure was “escalated” to the executive office. “I raised it verbally as well” he told investigators.

Antoun would become a key figure in the internal probe after investigators determined that he had embezzled $308000 through an “uncontrolled slush fund” set up through subcontractors. The revelation triggered a wider investigation into potential payments to terrorists.

Antoun later paid the money back. Ericsson said it fired him in January 2019. Antoun declined to comment.

Saadi the company’s top Iraq executive and Rafiah Ibrahim head of the Middle East and Africa region opposed invoking force majeure the report says.

‘Abandoned’ to ISIS

A month after Ericsson’s decision to press ahead in Mosul an engineer conducting tests of cell towers as part of the Peroza Project delivered a letter to an office where ISIS had set up operations according to the engineer who asked to be identified only by his first name Affan. The letter from Ericsson and Asiacell sought permission from the terrorist group to continue working in the area he said.

In interviews the engineer who worked for a subcontractor called Orbitel Telecommunication said the three companies insisted that work continue even after ISIS detained several of his colleagues for a time. Ericsson and his supervisor told him to deliver the letter in person Affan said. Orbitel declined to comment.

Affan said an ISIS militant later called and summoned him to a bridge overpass where men with scarves hiding their faces put a hood over his head shoved him into the back seat of a Toyota pickup and took off.

One assailant a sheikh forced him to call a senior Ericsson manager in the northern city of Sulaymaniyah and then shouting at the manager threatened to blow up Ericsson’s offices Affan said. The sheikh demanded millions of dollars “for every month we worked without ISIS notification” Affan said.

The internal review confirmed the kidnapping the phone call and the demand for money.

Affan said ISIS ordered him to remain at his Mosul home until Ericsson made the payments. He said that Ericsson and the other companies abandoned him and that company employees almost immediately stopped answering his calls. A few weeks later ISIS told him that he was free to leave his house.

Emails obtained by ICIJ’s German media partner NDR confirm several details of Affan’s account.

In an interview with internal investigators an Ericsson manager said Asiacell “made arrangements to obtain the release of the hostage and to let Ericsson continue the work in Mosul.”

The report doesn’t say what the arrangements were.

In interviews with ICIJ and media partners NDR and Daraj telecom employees and contractors in Iraq said it was common knowledge that before ISIS companies paid protection money to militants to prevent attacks on their equipment and to allow workers to do their jobs.

“If your business involves money you have to pay” Affan said. “If you don’t pay they will come after you.”

‘The legal way or the Speedway’

As part of the Peroza expansion Ericsson and its partner Asiacell needed to haul cell towers and equipment from Erbil in northern Iraq to Ramadi in the middle of the country. A transportation contractor Cargo Iraq offered two options according to the report: the “legal way” and the “Speedway.”

The Speedway was actually longer — and more expensive — but it had the advantage of avoiding Iraqi customs checkpoints which were often backed up for days if not weeks.

The problem: Parts of the Speedway passed through ISIS territory.

In interviews Iraqi truck drivers and local journalists said the route was perilous. ISIS militants set up checkpoints attacking and kidnapping travelers to extort money along a 100-kilometer stretch they said.

A trucker in his 40s with two children told NDR that he transported food and other commodities via the Speedway with its ISIS checkpoints. He said he once saw a man who had been fatally shot. Nearby a truck was on fire.

“The road is isolated and terrifying and not safe” he said.

The review identified 30 trucks — mostly 40-foot rigs — that paid $3000 to $4000 per load to carry Ericsson equipment across areas held by ISIS and other militias. One table in the report shows that in March 2017 Ericsson paid $22000 per truck for three loads on a single day.

“By avoiding official customs by transporting through areas controlled by militias including ISIS it cannot be excluded that Cargo Iraq engaged in facilitation payments (to official Customs officers) bribery and potential illicit financing of terrorism to carry out transportation operations for Ericsson” the report says.

Bahez Abbas owner of Cargo Iraq denied in an interview that his company paid ISIS.

According to the report Asiacell recommended that Ericsson hire Cargo Iraq. “Evidence suggests that Asiacell have engaged in smuggling and potential illegitimate payments directly and through Ericsson” the report says.

‘Collateral consequences’

Ekholm and the company have cited the company’s commitment to integrity ethical conduct and “doing business the right way.” At an earnings call in January for example the chief executive spoke about how the company was building a “world class compliance program” and “culture of integrity.”

Keeping wraps on an internal report describing widespread corruption appears at odds with that rhetoric experts say. Ericsson “seems to have fallen short of its own and investors’ standards on anti-corruption” said Joachim Nahem a partner at The Governance Group an Oslo based research and advisory group.

As part of the deal struck with the U.S. government in 2019 the company is obligated to be more transparent — with government officials at least. Ericsson promised to report wrongdoing and submit to audits and to the scrutiny of an outside monitor for three years.

At the plea hearing a prosecutor said the U.S. didn’t indict Ericsson and allowed an Egyptian subsidiary to plead guilty instead to avoid unspecified “collateral consequences.” Ericsson remains eligible to bid on U.S. government contracts.

Only one Ericsson employee has been charged in the U.S. case. Afework Bereket was indicted last year charged with arranging more than $2 million in bribes to three officials to beat out Huawei in the competition for a contract in Djibouti. He remains at large. Bereket and three other former Ericsson employees face a criminal trial in Sweden on charges related to the Djibouti matter.

Ekholm said the company would continue to investigate what happened in Iraq.

MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) -- Throughout Minneapolis people say they're doing what they can to show their support and solidarity for Ukraine.

Throughout downtown several buildings -- like Target Field U.S. Bank Stadium the Capella Tower Target Building and more -- shined yellow and blue Friday night. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and several city council members say they were behind the decision which will continue throughout the weekend.

In Northeast Minneapolis customers filled Kramarczuk's Sausage Company one of the city's most notable Ukrainian-owned businesses.

""I thought 'I've got to stop in today'"" said Wendy Morris who lives in Minneapolis. ""My mother's family is originally from Kyiv. This is just such a violation. People don't understand.""

Through purchases of stuffed cabbage and pierogies diners say they were putting their support and their money where their mouth is.

""We picked this restaurant because we like it and because of the Ukrainian crisis going on right now. We felt like we needed to support them"" said Marlene Kiester who joined a group of friends dining out Friday.

""It's heartbreaking it's really heartbreaking. It's hard to know what to do really from so far away"" Rebecca Ruddy said.

""My dad used to bring me here when I was a kid"" Patrick Hayes said. ""There's not a whole lot I can do from Minnesota but it's important for me to do just what I can. I know there's people from Ukraine who live in this neighborhood I know this place is Ukrainian-owned. It's just important for me to come out here and show support.""

Kramarczuk's is packing in for the dinner rush- many of the customers we talked to tonight say they're dining at the Ukranian-owned business as a sign of solidarity.

Warning: Contains Footage Some Readers May Find Upsetting

A never before seen video showing the second plane hitting the World Trade Center on September 11th 2001 has just been uploaded online and it provides a horrifying angle of the devastating attack that many have been yet to witness. Take a look below:

It has been more than 20 years since one of the world's deadliest terrorist attacks took place in New York City and still to this very day haunting details of the attack that killed almost 3000 people continue to reveal themselves.

Advert

And this new video is no exception.

Uploaded on YouTube on 24 February by user Kevin Westley the 9 minute clip shows the horrifying moment the second hijacked plane - United Airlines flight 175 - struck the World Trade Center's South Tower seventeen minutes after the North Tower was hit by American Airlines flight 11.

The person filming appears to have been stood amongst a stunned crowd at the water's edge in central New York City and gasps can be heard as the second plane appears as if out of nowhere.

When the plane crashes into the tower causing a huge fireball the crowd is heard screaming and someone says: ""Did you see that? He did it on purpose!""

YouTube/Kevin Westley

Since the shocking video was uploaded it has been viewed more than 200000 times and people have had a lot to say about it.

Advert

""I’ve never seen this. Hopefully this video won’t get taken off. The fact you captured this happening is so surreal"" one person commented.

""This video is incredible. It doesn't zoom in on the 2nd plane. It's like you're there"" another said while someone else pointed out: ""It’s so bizarre to see a new angle of something traumatic and disastrous that you’ve seen so many times before so many years later.""

But many have been left feeling suspicious as to why the uploader has waited over two decades to release the footage with one user asking: ""Why did it take Kevin over 20 years to upload the best quality video of the 9-11 attacks?""

Last year saw the 20th anniversary of 9/11 arrive and millions around the world came together to remember the 2977 people who tragically lost their lives on that fateful day.

This includes Mercedes Martinez who took to Twitter in a bid to track down the seven people her 'hero' dad helped on that very day.

Radio host Mercedes said her dad was flying from Ohio home to Denver when the pilot announced there had been a security breach and the plane needed to be grounded.

Aware something was wrong Mercedes' dad hired a rental van before the plane had even landed and after disembarking and catching wind of what was going on he rustled up a DIY sign saying: ""Going to Denver.""

Advert

He quickly filled the van with 'scared' strangers and drove from Omaha to Denver (more than 250 miles).

Each passenger was dropped right at their door and he declined money for fuel or the cost of renting the van.

Her father stayed in touch with a number of those strangers but he sadly died of brain cancer in 2016 and Mercedes wanted to track down the rest of them in aid of the 20th anniversary.

The California Council on Science and Technology had just revealed that the testing and treatment of hazardous chemicals in oil field wastewater used for irrigation was inadequate and legislators were demanding increased oversight. They feared that oil companies’ wastewater was threatening groundwater needed for drinking water and growing crops.

Faced with heightened scrutiny the California’s Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board raced to secure a consultant to study the controversial practice and soon settled on GSI Environmental as both qualified and unbiased.

Last fall armed with GSI’s completed studies the board tried to put concerns about the practice to rest assuring the public that the firm had found “no identifiable increased health risks” from irrigating crops with water recycled from oil wells.

But the board should never have chosen GSI scientists public interest activists and former regulators said in interviews citing the firm’s close ties to the oil industry—ties so close that GSI once listed on its website Chevron ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum as clients “we answer to.”

Chevron is the largest producer of oil field wastewater for irrigation in California. The company saves millions of dollars in disposal costs by selling the “produced water” to a local water district which in turn sells it to farmers in Kern County to irrigate their water-intensive almonds pistachios and citrus.

When the water board retained GSI the firm had already earned millions of dollars helping Chevron defend its interests in a single court case.

In addition to Chevron GSI had also helped other corporate polluters defend themselves against claims of environmental and health harms by providing litigation support and expert witness testimony documents filed in state and federal courts show.

Beyond its legal defense services GSI regularly takes research funds from the chemical and fossil fuel industries and collaborates on research with scientists who work for these industries a review of the scientific literature shows.

And it has published commentaries that cast doubt on evidence that oil and gas extraction or chemical industry products cause harm without disclosing its litigation support for these industries or its industry funding as a conflict of interest.

Robert Scofield who led the work for GSI said in a statement via email to Inside Climate News that his firm performed the studies in “the most technically sound manner.”

Despite the water board’s public assurances about food safety experts say GSI’s studies do not provide sufficient evidence to support those claims. And the board’s own Food Safety Expert Panel concluded that the studies could not answer fundamental safety questions about irrigating crops with water recycled from oil wells.

Defending Chevron in Court

GSI Environmental a Houston-based firm with California offices has a long history of working for oil companies and the law firms that defend them.

In 2010 John Connor president of GSI took the stand in a Mississippi circuit court on behalf of Chevron. He had come to defend the oil giant against five women from Fayette—a town whose residents are predominantly poor and Black—who blamed Chevron for their children’s health and intellectual disabilities.

The women had worked in a building converted from a gas station that their lawyers tied to Texaco bought by Chevron in 2001. They believed leaded gas fumes from storage tanks left underground had seeped into the building while they were pregnant and caused their children’s disabilities.

Connor testified that a gas station across the street was to blame. But the women’s lawyers offered proof that there had never been a gas station across the street. Three days after Connor’s testimony a jury awarded the women $19 million.

During the trial Connor acknowledged that between 2000 and 2010 Chevron paid his firm nearly $8 million documents filed with the Circuit Court of Jefferson County show. Between 2004 and 2008 GSI received roughly $5 million for what Connor testified was “a major undertaking” for Chevron’s defense against Indigenous Ecuadoreans seeking damages from Texaco for allegedly dumping billions of gallons of produced water in the rainforest.

Connor had been tapped as a lead expert witness for Chevron by the international law firm King & Spalding which also defends the tobacco industry.

“There’s a sense that if someone has done work for one party that they’re somehow beholden to that party but it’s not really the case” Connor said. “In our case we work for all kinds of different companies. And we don’t take on the mantle of any of those companies.”

Connor estimated that litigation support accounts for about 30 percent of GSI’s business. “Some of it’s been for government” he said. “A lot of it’s for industry on their problems.”

The water board had determined that GSI did not appear to have a bias “that would be unacceptable.” A simple Google search reveals Connor’s public testimony about GSI’s work for Chevron in Ecuador.

The water board had required proposed consultants to “execute” a disclosure statement in an agreement between the board and the oil companies and water districts it regulates. But neither the board nor GSI could find a copy of a completed statement. Connor said the board never sent it.

Clay Rodgers the official in charge of the water control board’s food safety review said he had no proof of sending it but if he didn’t it was likely a simple oversight. “We reviewed GSI’s background extensively” Rodgers said “noting that they had done some work for oil companies in the past.”

Rodgers said he was not aware of GSI’s expert witness and litigation support for the oil industry.

Scofield GSI’s lead on the project told a water board official that he could not find a disclosure statement in the firm’s files in an email obtained by Inside Climate News. Scofield also told the water board official that GSI met the board’s criteria. “Specifically we ‘possess the experience expertise and impartiality necessary to ensure the quality of the Study’” Scofield wrote paraphrasing the board’s requirements for a consultant. Chevron representative Jonathan Harshman said the water board chose a consultant based on the firm’s qualifications and integrity. The water board staff found GSI Environmental “to be well qualified and unbiased in their approach” said Harshman communications advisor for Chevron’s San Joaquin Valley Business Unit.

Successful highly qualified consulting firms work for a multitude of companies said Rodgers who worked nearly two decades in private consulting himself. The board took steps to limit contact between GSI and the oil districts and water districts that paid their fees he said adding that it would have been “almost impossible” to find a consultant that did no work for oil companies but had the expertise needed for this type of project.

“You’re going to disqualify perhaps most of the highly qualified folks if you say you can never have done any work for an oil company” he said.

“That’s the problem in a nutshell” said Benjamin Franta a doctoral candidate at Stanford University where he studies the behavior of the fossil fuel industry. “When conflicts of interest become so pervasive that they become normalized and there’s no alternative that’s a problem.”

Industry Influence on the Panel

The Central Valley water board convened its expert panel in 2015 to make sure it wasn’t missing potential health harms from growing crops with produced water. Two experts on the nine-member panel had ties to the oil industry. One expert had worked for the consulting firm ERM whose clients included a California spinoff of Occidental Petroleum California Resources Corporation or CRC.

Another was nominated by Chevron which initially paid for her participation. Mark Bradford who joined the seven-member water board three years after the panel was formed had long worked for ERM when he was appointed to the board by former Gov. Jerry Brown. Bradford now chairs the water board.

At the Food Safety Panel’s first public meeting in 2016 Mark Jones a panel member then working for the consulting firm ERM presented a study sponsored by Occidental spinoff CRC a provider of produced water.

Jones who based his study on CRC data from its Kern Front oil field assured the panel that produced water from the company’s oil field fell below levels of concern for every chemical analyzed in every crop tested.

But Jones had looked for just a fraction of the chemicals that might be in the crops. When a public health scientist on the panel Seth Shonkoff asked Jones if he thought his data accurately reflected what was in the wastewater water coming from the oil fields Jones acknowledged he didn’t know.

Soon after it became clear that Jones worked as a paid consultant for the oil industry a coalition of public interest organizations urged the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board to require panel members to disclose conflict of interests on forms made public.

The board declined explaining in a letter that it was unnecessary because panel members had been asked to “base their scientific conclusions on an objective assessment of all relevant evidence” rather than voice the views of their affiliated organizations. In any event the board wrote Jones is no longer employed by ERM.

The groups made another appeal for disclosure in June 2017 after learning that a second panel member Barbara Petersen had been nominated by Chevron. Petersen works for Exponent which also consults for oil and gas companies.

Chevron funded her participation through much of the first year then her position was funded by CalFLOWS through at least May 2017. CalFLOWS is a tax-exempt coalition of business farming and energy interests concerned about the state’s water future. Its board of directors includes representatives of Chevron CRC and another supplier of produced water Aera Energy.

Petersen did not respond to several requests for comment. Jones who now works for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said through an agency spokeswoman that he did not feel comfortable talking about his role with the panel because he no longer works on the project.

Months after public interest groups again raised their concerns about the expert panel’s makeup they still had seen no response from the board Bill Allayaud California government affairs director for the Environmental Working Group a nonprofit environmental advocacy organization said at a public meeting. “Is there a response to that yet?” he asked Rodgers.

We’re hiring! Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. See jobs

“We did look at what we considered viable potential conflicts of panel members” Rodgers replied explaining that the board wanted a group that represented all the stakeholders.

“I had a lot of complaints about Dr. Shonkoff being part of the panel that he was biased in his approach” Rodgers added at the meeting referring to Seth Shonkoff executive director of Physicians Scientists and Engineers (PSE) for Healthy Energy a nonprofit research institute. “My comment was ‘I need a panel that represents everybody. I want Dr. Shonkoff on the panel because he represents a different view.’”

Asked later in an interview who had complained about Shonkoff Rodgers declined to tell Inside Climate News.

Western States Petroleum Association or WSPA which lobbies on behalf of Chevron Exxon and other oil giants paid Exponent and ERM $169000 between 2016 and 2020 for consulting and other unspecified services campaign finance disclosures show.

Shonkoff said he told the board early on that it was of the “utmost importance” that advisory boards fill out conflict of interest forms. There should be a transparent process that reveals who has a stake in the project’s outcome he said. “We did not go through that process.”

Shonkoff himself was approached by the Environmental Defense Fund which wanted to pay for his time on the panel. He felt being funded by an environmental advocacy group would be inappropriate and turned down the offer.

“Scientific knowledge generation should not be conducted by a stakeholder group” said Shonkoff the only panel member who had published several peer-reviewed studies on the public health effects of oil and gas operations. “It needs to be independent.”

Turning Waste into a Resource

Produced water is the oil and gas industry’s largest waste stream across the country.

Regulators don’t track what California oil companies pay to dispose of it. But Eric Hoek a professor of engineering at the University of California Los Angeles said costs range from about 10 cents a barrel for on-site disposal to as much as $15 a barrel to truck it to a permitted disposal well.

For an industry that disposes of more than 700 million barrels of wastewater each year—about 29.4 billion gallons—disposal is a costly proposition. Chevron can save more than half a million dollars a year by selling its wastewater to a local water district.

That’s why Chevron forged a deal with the Cawelo Water District north of its Kern River Oil Field in the mid-1990s. Chevron saw an opportunity to reduce disposal costs and Cawelo welcomed an alternative water source for farmers in one of the state’s driest agricultural regions.

Farmers in Kern County the center of California’s oil industry use about 36000 acre-feet of produced water a year to grow mostly water-intensive almonds pistachios and citrus. That’s nearly 12 billion gallons or enough to cover about 36000 football fields with a foot of water. Chevron supplies nearly two-thirds of farmers’ produced water in California.

At the first public meeting Cawlelo’s general manager David Ansolabehere said the district pays as much as $170 an acre-foot to pump groundwater and up to $200 an acre-foot for surface water—that is when it’s available. In contrast the district pays just $30 an acre-foot for produced water providing an incentive to expand the practice.

To ensure continued access to a cheap reliable water source the district hired its own consultant Enviro-Tox to analyze crops just as the Food Safety Project got underway. The district also hired a PR firm to help field media inquiries from around the world said Ansolabehere.

The firm Fiona Hutton & Associates also handles public relations for WSPA the oil industry trade group.

WSPA spent nearly $9 million to lobby state politicians and regulators in 2014 when California tightened rules on produced water and more than $2 million in the last quarter of 2016 when WSPA lobbyists approached the Central Valley Water Board and other regulators about “food safety for produced water for agriculture.”

The Central Valley water board took over Cawelo’s testing program Ansolabehere noted in a 2019 memo to “eliminate a potential perceived conflict of interest with Cawelo managing the food safety analysis process.”

The board also turned down Cawelo’s suggestion to use its consultant for the Food Safety Project studies concerned that Enviro-Tox’s previous work for oil companies presented a conflict said Jessica Jahr counsel for the State Water Resources Control Board.

Instead Cawelo proposed GSI Environmental.

“We Answer to Them”

Ansolabehere said he recommended GSI because they’d done similar work in the past and could “perform the work in the time allotted.”

GSI’s Scofield asked if he had disclosed his firm’s work for the oil industry including providing expert testimony in court replied by email: “The organizations to whom we have provided our scientific consulting services are identified on our web page and are available to all parties.”

Told there is no list of clients on GSI’s website he acknowledged that the current site does not identify clients and that there appear to be no live links to past web pages that did.

The Internet Archive does provide those links. On a 2010 page promoting its services under the heading WE ANSWER TO THEM Chevron tops the list of industrial clients followed by ExxonMobil Monsanto Halliburton Schlumberger Occidental Petroleum and BASF.

“Oil companies are companies that have environmental problems” said GSI’s Connor. “That’s what we work on so we work for them.”

A lot of people in the scientific community work for different parties Connor said. “It’s not expected that you’re going to say ‘Hey I worked for this one company so my opinion is colored by that.’”

Connor said he’s aware of concerns of bias around consulting for pharmaceutical companies. “But that’s not a consideration in our business” he said. “Everybody that does what we do works for a lot of different companies.”

There’s abundant evidence that industry involvement in research tends to produce findings that favor the sponsor’s product said Lisa Bero professor of medicine and public health and chief scientist at the University of Colorado’s Center for Bioethics and Humanities. This so-called funding effect has been documented in the tobacco chemical drug food and fossil fuel industries among others.

“I think most people are not even aware there are consulting firms that are hired by big companies to basically do science for hire” said Stanford’s Franta.

If a firm has a history of working with an industry with a vested interest in the outcome of an enterprise or has any current or prospective future financial interest in that industry—such as revenues from consulting work—that’s a conflict of interest he said.

“If you worked for them in the past it stands to reason that you might work for them again and that’s an ongoing interest” he said. “That’s why even past work should be disclosed.”

The business model of these types of “product defense” consulting firms is to produce reports that polluting corporations can use to slow regulation or win court cases said David Michaels a George Washington University professor of environmental and occupational health and former head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

“These firms only write reports that are in the interests of their corporate clients” said Michaels whose book “Triumph of Doubt” details how regulated industries manufacture scientific uncertainty to protect their bottom line. If their reports found their client’s product was dangerous he added “they’d lose business.”

“Bent” Science

Several years ago Wayne Landis an expert in ecological risk assessment at Western Washington University set out to evaluate the sustainability of hydraulic fracturing with his student MariAnna Lane.

When they dug into the technical literature they didn’t find much research. And much of what they did find was “severely bent” said Landis referring to a strategy described in the book “Bending Science: How Special Interests Corrupt Public Health Research.”

Science is “bent” when it is “willfully manipulated to serve a predetermined policy goal” Landis and Lane explained in their chapter for the 2016 book Environmental and Health Issues in Unconventional Oil and Gas. Industries often deploy the strategy to deflect blame and liability though Landis and Lane found examples in government academia and nongovernmental organizations as well.

The pair encountered different degrees of bending science Landis said in an interview but one group stood out as an “excellent example”: GSI Environmental.

GSI’s Connor and his colleagues published papers on the source of methane contamination of groundwater in a poor rural region of northeastern Pennsylvania where dozens of families had sued Cabot Oil & Gas claiming its drilling polluted their wells. GSI coauthored the papers with Cabot Oil & Gas scientists and thanked the company one of the biggest drillers in the Marcellus Shale for permission to publish their data.

The studies concluded that methane contamination was a natural feature of the region’s geology unrelated to fracking.

That GSI absolved fracking of responsibility for contaminating groundwater might not have seemed suspect Landis and Lane wrote in their chapter if it hadn’t also attacked contrary research that did implicate fracking using inflammatory language not typically found in scientific discourse.

It’s common for scientists to critique papers using precise terms that dissect the methods and data analysis. They don’t use loaded language he said in the interview like calling harmful findings “allegations” as GSI did on its web site.

“Mr. Landis incorrectly criticized peer-reviewed publications by two GSI staff members” Connor wrote in an email. “Mr. Landis is not an expert in the scientific topics of these publications and it does not appear that he reviewed the technical content of the papers.”

That reply is actually bending science Landis said. “We had very specific criteria” he said which laid out the kinds of terminology used when someone intentionally bends science.

Landis said the fact that Connor attacked his technical expertise but not his evaluation of the language as evidence of bending science is telling. His response Landis said “was bolstering this case that it was bending science.”

In an interview Connor said that researchers who had linked fracking to groundwater contamination wouldn’t release their data. In fact the scientists had an agreement with homeowners to protect the address of their wells and released the data in a way that retained their privacy.

Last July Physicians for Social Responsibility or PSR reported that Chevron ExxonMobil and other major oil and gas companies had used toxic chemicals called PFAS in more than 1200 wells in six states. Scientists have linked the perfluorinated compounds dubbed “forever chemicals” because they don’t break down to developmental delays thyroid disease impaired immune function cancer and other serious health problems.

After a flurry of national stories about the report GSI Environmental scientists led by Connor posted a critique on the firm’s web site.

“We find that this article presents an inaccurate and exaggerated picture of the use of PFAS in hydraulic fracturing and the risks posed to public health and the environment” Connor and his GSI colleagues wrote.

They listed eight reasons why readers should not believe PSR’s report and noted in a news release that GSI received “no third-party funding” for the critique.

The same year GSI did acknowledge funding from the FluoroCouncil PFAS-manufacturers’ trade group to publish a framework to assess the chemicals’ toxicity. The FluoroCouncil promotes the claim contrary to independent research that new “short chain” compounds are safer than their “long chain” counterparts PFOA and PFOS which have been phased out due to concerns about their human health and environmental risks.

Connor said he had nothing to do with the FluoroCouncil project so it wouldn’t have been on his mind. And when a firm works for a lot of different companies it’s not expected to disclose funding for just doing a “project” he said. “That’s not how it’s done. It doesn’t represent any type of failure to disclose.”

Furthermore he added the GSI paper had nothing to do with whether PFAS was dangerous or safe which is a FluoroCouncil issue but whether it was in fracking fluid. “I wouldn’t say that was a failure to disclose” Connor said “because it’s about the use of that material in the oil industry.”

Yet Linda Birnbaum former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and an expert on the substances read the GSI critique as a dismissal of public health concerns around most PFAS. She said the firm claimed the public health concerns PSR described apply only to the most well-known compounds PFOA and PFOS not to other fluorinated compounds.

“That’s just not true” Birnbaum said.

Meanwhile the water board entrusted a consulting firm that has defended the oil industry against high-stakes claims of environmental and health harms to conduct unbiased studies in the public interest. Had the board asked about the firm’s work for oil companies—the ones it once listed on its web site—it may have considered alternatives.

There are many many other kinds of organizations that could be neutral parties that really are neutral and do the type of research that informs policy Landis said.

That’s a role universities and especially the state universities and land grant universities that are used to doing applied work can play he said. “There was no need to go to an industry stalwart.”

PMICs control voltage current and heat dissipation in a system so the device can function efficiently without consuming too much power. The PMIC manages battery charging and monitors sleep modes DC-to-DC conversions and voltage and current setting adjustments in real-time.

In the past six months a number of developers have designed compact single-chip PMICs to meet the growing demand for smaller more power-efficient electronics. Here are a few PMICs designed with automotive wearables/hearables and artificial intelligence (AI) in mind.





Maxim/ADI's PMIC Integrates Switching Charger for Wearables

Maxim Integrated (now part of Analog Devices) is known for its analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits for the automotive industrial communications consumer and computing markets. Maxim has an established portfolio of PMICs for both high-performing and low-power solutions.

Maxim Integrated’s MAX77659 SIMO PMIC comes with a built-in 300 mA switching charger to help extend battery lifespan. Image used courtesy of Maxim Integrated

The high-performance PMICs are said to maximize tasks per watt while increasing system efficiency for complex systems-on-chip (SoCs) FPGAs and application processors. Maxim says the low-power PMICs pack multiple power rails and power management features in a small footprint.

The company recently released a tiny PMIC designed to charge wearables and listening devices four times faster than conventional chargers. This device the MAX77659 is a single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) PMIC equipped with Analog Devices’ switch-mode buck-boost charger. Geared for wearables hearables and IoT designs this device is said to provide over four hours of battery life with one 10-minute charge.

This PMIC includes low-dropout (LDO) regulators that provide noise mitigation and help derive voltage from the battery when lighter loads are occurring. Like a load switch these LDOs disconnect external blocks not in use to decrease power consumption. Two GPIOs and an analog multiplexer are incorporated in the MAX77659 to allow the PMIC to switch between several internal voltages and current signals to an external node for monitoring.

ROHM’s PMIC Aims to Improve ADAS Camera Modules

ROHM Semiconductor believes it is addressing the demand for smaller more compact PMICs in the automotive realm. Now the company is targeting this market with PMIC solutions for tiny satellite camera modules. To do this the company plans on combining its existing SerDes ICs with a new PMIC.

This combo was designed to solve issues revolving around the compact footprints and low power consumption of new camera modules. It also features a new element: low electromagnetic noise (EMI) cancellation. These cameras assist with object detection to ensure the driver’s safety from potential risks around the vehicle.

Through a single IC the voltage settings and sequence controls can be performed to reduce the mounting area by 41% according to ROHM. Image used courtesy of ROHM Semiconductor

ROHM says the SerDes IC optimizes the transmission rate based on video resolution and reduces power consumption by approximately 27%. The device is also equipped with a spread-spectrum function that mitigates noise by nearly 20 dB while improving the reliability of images taken by the ADAS cameras.

The PMIC is designed to manage the power supply systems of any CMOS image sensor. Using a camera-specific PMIC can help deliver high conversion efficiency that leads to low power consumption. The SerDes IC dissipates heat concentration with an external LDO to supply power to the CMOS image sensor. The close proximity of the image sensor and the LDO decreases the disturbance noise in the power supply.

Renesas Hones in on AI With MPU-focused PMIC

Renesas has also announced a new PMIC in the past few months—this one for MPUs. The company says the new PMIC RAA215300 complements two of Renesas’ microprocessors (MPUs) (32-bit and 64-bit) built for AI applications.

The new RAA215300 PMIC enables four-layer PCBs which is a cost-effective route for developers to take. This higher level of integration also increases system reliability because it doesn't need as many external components on the board.

Key features for Renesas’ PMIC solution are a built-in power sequencer a real-time clock a super cap charger and an ultrasonic mode for eliminating unwanted audible noise interference found in microphones or speakers. A feature worth highlighting is the fact that this PMIC can support different memory power requirements ranging from DDR3 to LPDDR4.

A PMIC for Any Application

Some characteristics of PMICs are valuable across the board—for instance the ability to add separate input current limits and battery current settings. These features simplify monitoring since the current in the charger is independently regulated and not shared among the other system loads.

Each of these PMICs from Maxim ROHM and Renesas illustrate the many different use cases for which PMICs may aid designers.

Maxim Integrated's PMIC incorporates a smart power selector charging component for addressing smaller wearable technologies. This SIMO PMIC also has GPIOs that can communicate to the CPU with signals received from switches or sensors. ROHM targets automotive applications. With an increasing demand for solutions that occupy less space within the ADAS system ROHM’s PMIC may be of use in small cameras. Lastly Renesas’ PMIC was built for AI and MPUs. This device is essentially built like a microscopic tank. The 9-channel PMIC holds a larger footprint at 8 x 8 mm; however it is equipped with DDR memory a built-in charger and RTC along with six buck regulators and three LDOs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vYXJtLWxhcHRvcC1saW51eC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 4 Best ARM Linux Laptops You Can Buy Now,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vYXJtLWxhcHRvcC1saW51eC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vaGFja2FkYXkuY29tLzIwMjIvMDIvMjYvNjAtcGMtb3NjaWxsb3Njb3BlLXJldmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,$60 PC Oscilloscope Review,"Owning an oscilloscope is a real gamechanger and these days scopes are more capable and less expensive than ever before. However there is a big difference between scopes that cost several hundred dollars which are usually quite good and many of the very inexpensive — below $100 — instruments that are often — but not always — little more than toys. [Adrian] looks at a PC-based scope from Hantek that costs about $60. Is it a toy? Or a useful tool? He answers the question in the video below.

The Hantek 6022BE sports two channels with a 20 MHz bandwidth and 48 million samples per second. The device included probes too. Of course you also need a PC although there is apparently third-party software for Android if you don’t want to lug a laptop around.

With two channels and relatively low bandwidth and sample rates this Hantek is not going to displace a good benchtop scope but you aren’t going to get one of those at this price point. The question you have to ask yourself is what do you actually need? In [Adrian’s] case he wants to work on things like Commodore 64 computers so 20MHz should be just fine for that sort of thing.

The software looks a bit dated but it does have a lot of features you’d find on traditional scopes. The triggering however wasn’t very capable but since the device uses USB2 you can guess that the triggering is all happening in the device which probably can’t handle anything too complex. The results matched fairly well with a more capable instrument that [Adrian] had on hand.

The verdict? [Adrian] thought it was probably worth the money but did wish for some things to be better. Many commenters however urged him to try unofficial software for the device which is supposed to be much better. We weren’t that interested in the device as an oscilloscope but given that the protocol is apparently understood we wondered if it might not find a home as a cheap data acquisition module in some future project.

We’ve seen reviews of Hantek’s scope meter recently. We are always on the lookout for what kind of scope you can get for under $100.",,,,,,

In December 2021 Stroz Friedberg’s Incident Response Services team engaged in a Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) investigation and environment-wide recovery of a Cuba ransomware incident. We discovered novel indicators of compromise (IOCs) utilizing an interesting technique. Here as part of the Cuba’s toolset the threat actor group executed a script that abused a function in an Avast® Anti Rootkit kernel driver to terminate popular AV and EDR processes.

While the use of kernel drivers to target and kill AV and EDR solutions1 prior to encryption has been known and discussed for some time the abuse of a signed and valid driver from an Antivirus vendor2 was surprisingly effective and ironic.

At the time of writing this article there are three different versions of the same attack. They are listed below in the order of implementation complexity:

A self-contained PowerShell script dropped alongside the Avast driver that installs and loads the driver and executes a small number of functions to control the driver.

An executable that unpacks and loads in memory a small executable to control the driver. Within this blog we refer to this executable as the controller. Additional tools are used to install and load the Avast driver in the infected system.

A batch script that installs a service to load the Avast kernel driver then launches a PowerShell script to decode load and execute the controller in memory.

This article delves into the implementation of the third variant of the attack where the attacker uses a batch script as described in the third bullet point above.

The Staging – Batch Script

The first stage of the hijack starts with the threat actor dropping three files a batch script a PowerShell script and an Avast driver within the target system’s “C:\Windows” and “C:\Windows\Temp” directories.

The threat actor executes the batch script to create and start a new service that utilizes a legitimate Avast Anti Rootkit kernel driver named aswArPot.sys. A short timeout is included to ensure the service is fully started prior to the execution of the PowerShell script used to unpack and execute the controller.

@ echo off sc.exe create aswSP_ArPot2 binPath= C:\windows\temp\aswArPot.sys type= kernel sc.exe start aswSP_ArPot2 Timeout /t 3 C:\Windows\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -windowstyle hidden -executionpolicy bypass -file c:\windows\temp\SAMPLE.ps1

The Obfuscation – PowerShell Loader Script

The PowerShell script contains multiple layers of obfuscation which when executed decodes its contents and rebuilds the controller. Once the PowerShell script finishes rebuilding the controller it utilizes Windows Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to load and execute the controller in memory.

Add-Type -TypeDefinition @' using System; using System.Diagnostics; using System.Runtime.InteropServices; public static class RANDOMSTRING1 { [DllImport(""kernel32.dll"")] public static extern IntPtr VirtualAlloc(IntPtr RANDOMSTRING2 uint RANDOMSTRING3 uint RANDOMSTRING4 uint RANDOMSTRING5); [DllImport(""PowrProf.dll"")] public static extern IntPtr EnumPwrSchemes(IntPtr RANDOMSTRING6 IntPtr RANDOMSTRING7); } '@ Function ouBmwjaLNIuXYiiWYYxZt() { return (([regex]::Matches('[Redacted_Base64_String…]

The Controller – Malicious Portable Executable (PE)

The small (~5KB in size) PE loaded into memory proved to be simple yet effective. The executable is designed to collate a list of actively running processes then compare them to an obfuscated hardcoded list of CRC64 checksum values of AV and EDR processes names. If any process name directly correlates to an entry in the hardcoded list an I/O Control (IOCTL) code is sent to the Avast driver resulting in the termination of the process.

Disassembling the sample on Ghidra provides insight into the hashing and comparison functions of the controller:

1. The initial function creates a handle to reference the recently installed Avast driver via the CreateFileW API. If the driver handle returns as valid the executable calls a function to find and terminate processes.

2. Once inside this function a snapshot of actively running processes is taken. The function then iterates through the lowercase Unicode representation of processes names and calculates a CRC64 checksum on each of them using the CRC64_ECMA_182 algorithm.

3. The executable then cycles through the hardcoded list of CRC64 checksum values (QWORD_009c2030) each of which represents the name of known AV or EDR processes. In the sample discussed in this article the hardcoded list contained 119 (0x77) CRC64 checksum values.

4. If the sample finds a match it calls the Avast process termination function passing the handle of the Avast driver and the matching process ID.

5. The DeviceIoControl API is called which sends the 0x9988c094 IOCTL code to the Avast driver along with the process ID. This results in the Avast driver terminating the process at Kernel level bypassing tamper protection implemented in most AV and EDR products.

The Kill – Avast IOCTL Code

The aswArPot.sys Avast driver interprets the 0x9988c094 IOCTL code as a signal to terminate a given process. Below are the pieces of the Avast driver disassembled and decompiled for research purposes which show the method to terminate a process from kernel mode using KeAttachProcess and ZwTerminateProcess functions:

This IOCTL code and function can be found on multiple versions of the aswArPot.sys Avast driver including the version distributed on Avast products as of December 2021. However it was confirmed through behavioral analysis that the latest distributed versions of the Avast driver are not susceptible to this abuse. Upon contacting the Avast Bug Bounty team we have received confirmation that the issue was known and had been resolved by Avast on a February 2021 update of the driver. Furthermore we have received confirmation that Avast has been in contact with Microsoft to have them invalidate the signature of older versions of the driver. Avast has been informed by Microsoft that a security update on March 2022 would contain the signature update.

The specific aswArPot.sys driver utilized by the threat actors in this instance (SHA256: 4b5229b3250c8c08b98cb710d6c056144271de099a57ae09f5d2097fc41bd4f1) has the following file version information:

The Targets

Different implementations of this driver’s abuse found either on VirusTotal or on the engagements contain different lists of targeted processes.

The smallest PowerShell script implementation targets only one specific process.

Three “early” versions of the PE found on VirusTotal contained clear-text strings of the targeted processes along with the transparently named PDB path “ F:\\Source\\WorkNew19\\KillAV\\Release\\KillAV.pdb “. These versions contained 53 72 and 88 targeted processes with the PE compilation timestamps of October 28 th  November 2 nd and November 3 rd  2021 respectively.

53 72 and 88 The PE with the longest target list of all found during the Cuba ransomware incident contained 110 unique targeted processes (after removing duplicates) represented as CRC64 checksum values. It also contained the newest PE compilation timestamp of all.

Utilizing the HashDB API service from OpenAnalysis3 we were able to recover the clear-text strings corresponding to the hardcoded CRC64 checksums of the latter sample mentioned above. The list contains process names from well-known AV and EDR vendors which include amongst others processes names from SentinelOne® Cylance® Avast® Carbon Black® Sophos® McAfee® and Malwarebytes®.

Below is the list of 110 targeted processes found in the latest PE:

Future Functionality?

The PE found during the Cuba ransomware incident also contains a second smaller chunk of CRC64 checksums which correspond to the names of three specific ransomware executables utilized by Cuba Ransomware: “a.exe” “anet.exe” and “aus.exe”. These checksums sit next to unutilized strings “/c del“ “>> NUL” and “\\system32\\cmd.exe“. These strings are never referenced. Along with the recent iterations and enhancements on observed versions of this PE these strings indicate that a potential future version of this executable could include a function to automatically delete the ransomware executables from disk.

Closing Remarks

The capabilities brought to the table by exploiting functionalities of a signed and widely distributed Antivirus piece of software running under the highest privileges on a system demonstrates the power of this technique. The sophistication and resources being applied by ransomware groups into new innovative ways to bypass security controls continues to increase.

As the new top model the Fritzbox 5590 Fiber complements the previously available Fritzbox 5530 Fiber. The 5590 model relies on double the number of MIMO streams in the WLAN Wi-Fi 6 and two USB ports.

Fritzbox 5590 Fiber unveiled

AVM will unveil its latest fiber-optic router the Fritzbox 5590 Fiber at Mobile World Congress 2022 which will be held in Barcelona from February 28. It is intended for a fiber connection in the private sector (fiber-to-the-home FTTH).

In terms of usage the new 5590 hardly differs from its sister Fritzbox 5530. One inserts a fiber optic adapter into the SFP (Small Form-Factor Pluggable) slot. Two SFP modules for active (Active Optical Network AON) or passive networks (Passive Optical Network PON) are already included. They provide a maximum transmission speed of 1 Gbit/s. However the Fritzbox 5590 is already fit for the new XGS-PON standard which can provide up to 10 Gbit/s with SFP+ modules.

A LAN host is possible via the new router with the help of the Multigigabit Ethernet port. Up to 2.5 Gbit/s are realized here. Four additional ports with a maximum of 1 Gbit/s are also available.

WLAN with up to 2.4 Gbit per second

Wirelessly the Fritzbox 5590 Fiber transmits via Wi-Fi 6 (IEEE 802.11ax) at up to 2.4 Gbit/s gross in the 5 GHz band. The speed is realized via four MIMO streams – the Fritzbox 5530 Fiber achieves the same speed with two MIMO streams at 160 MHz.

The doubling of the streams in the 2.4 GHz band provides an advantage. Here up to 1.2 Gbit per second is possible with the new model compared to 600 Mbit/s with the 5530. Another innovation is two USB-A ports which were conspicuous by their absence in the 5530 model.

The Fritzbox 5590 Fiber offers two Type-A ports with transfer rates of 5 Gbit/s each (USB 3.2 Gen 1) for example to share hard drive storage or printers in the LAN and WLAN network. However the 5590 does without an ISDN S0 port. This was already omitted from the recently released Fritzbox 6690 Cable. Once again the FritzOS operating system is used as the user interface which comes with the familiar functions such as smart home control VPN setup and VoIP telephony.

When companies flare they do more than burn natural gas. They burn money

Cronkite News ) – Every year U.S. oil and gas companies set fire to billions of cubic feet of natural gas and directly vent an additional unknown amount. These processes known as flaring and venting don’t just waste resources; they also pollute the atmosphere with hazardous global-warming gases such as methane.

Companies argue that they flare and vent for safety and maintenance and because selling or reusing the gas is not financially feasible. The industry and its regulators even refer to this gas as “waste.” But experts say a valuable resource is being squandered because of weak regulations ineffective tracking of flaring and venting and a lack of economic incentives to capture and sell the gas.

“The atmosphere is a free dumping place” said Robert L. Kleinberg senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. “It’s like throwing garbage out the window back in the Middle Ages.”

A satellite data analysis by the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism found that oil and gas companies in the 13 top-flaring states designated by the Department of Energy flared more than 3.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas between 2012 and 2020. That’s equal to more than $10.6 billion in revenue based on the market value of natural gas in each of those years.

The American Petroleum Institute the nation’s main oil and gas trade association would not answer questions from the Howard Center. Instead it noted previous statements in which the group has said flaring is necessitated by “a lack of gas gathering lines or processing capacity” and for safety reasons. Nonetheless the group has acknowledged that flaring must be reduced.

Colin Leyden the Texas political director for nonprofit advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund says that the oil and gas industry’s routine flaring is driven by “purely the economic interests of the company.”

“In other words we’re here for the oil” he said of the industry’s thinking. “We’d like to make money on the gas but if we don’t we’ve got the oil to make our profit. That’s what our economics are built around.”

We use natural gas everyday to heat our homes cook our food and dry our clothes. But where does natural gas come from and how do its emissions contribute to climate change? Natural gas is a fossil fuel released from the ground during oil and gas drilling. Fracking is the process of injecting liquid into the ground at a high pressure causing rock fixtures to crack open and release the natural gas and oil trapped inside. The natural gas that is extracted can either be sold on the market used at the wellsite or disposed of entirely. Many drilling companies say it’s safer or more economical to dispose of the gas than to use or sell it. They do this by burning it off or “flaring.” Natural gas is composed mainly of methane and other greenhouse gases but flaring burns away a large percentage of those compounds releasing mostly carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. However many malfunctioning flares burn off less methane than they’re supposed to. These inefficient flares push a larger percentage of the greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. Some flares are unlit and simply “vent” methane directly into the air. Venting is invisible to the naked eye yet it’s more harmful than flaring. Methane released during flaring and venting has more than 80 times the potential to trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere than carbon dioxide within a 20-year period. Experts say flaring and venting are the “low-hanging fruit” of efforts to slow climate change. Graphic: Nicole Sadek Zachary Van Arsdale / Howard Center for Investigative Journalism

Regulatory exemptions

Flaring occurs mostly at oil wells but even companies that primarily produce and sell natural gas also burn off some of it.

At best a flare breaks down methane-rich natural gas so that only a small amount of the pollutant escapes into the air. At worst a flare is defective spewing methane into the atmosphere.

Some flaring is unavoidable the oil and gas industry says. Between 15% and 25% of natural gas produced in the United States is estimated to be “sour” or contaminated with hydrogen sulfide the nonprofit Earthworks reports. This gas must go through a purification process to become marketable. Not all operators find this process economical so they flare the sour gas instead.

Operators also flare when drilling or plugging a well to control emissions. Instead of allowing greenhouse gases to escape from the well unadulterated companies choose to flare them.

Some state regulatory agencies allow companies to burn natural gas that they can’t get to market. These companies may not have the technology to convert gas to liquid for transport or some of their wells may not be connected to high-capacity pipelines.

A flare burns associated natural gas on an oil pad on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation on Oct. 27 2021. More than 199 billion cubic feet of natural gas has been burned on the reservation from 2012 to 2020 according to a Howard Center Investigation. (Isaac Stone Simonelli / Howard Center for Investigative Journalism)

For example when producers in North Dakota’s Bakken Shale began placing multiple wells on a single well pad gas production exceeded pipeline capacity forcing operators to dispose of excess gas according to Lynn Helms the director of North Dakota’s Department of Mineral Resources. But a Howard Center analysis of North Dakota Pipeline Authority reports shows that flaring still occurs more often at wells connected to pipelines compared to those that are not.

State agencies also make exceptions for companies that claim connecting to a pipeline is too costly.

In Oklahoma regulators may allow flaring if it is not “economically feasible to market the gas.” Louisiana has a similar “economic hardship” clause for venting gas directly into the atmosphere. State statutes don’t always clearly define these terms and the regulatory agencies simply require companies to demonstrate that getting the gas to market is economically impractical.

Eliminating routine flaring however is technically and politically feasible experts say.

“No one has any reason to put methane into the air for beneficial purpose” said Kleinberg the energy policy scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.

Some companies are already working on slashing routine flaring. Apache Corporation a subsidiary of publicly traded oil company APA Corporation which operates in Texas said in October 2021 that it reached its goal to end routine flaring after investing in pipeline infrastructure. Several other public companies have endorsed plans to eliminate routine flaring by 2030 according to the Environmental Defense Fund.

That nonprofit environmental advocacy group says that policies requiring gas capture — the process of trapping natural gas to prevent its release into the atmosphere — are effective and inexpensive ways to end flaring.

Methods for using the extracted natural gas on-site exist and engineers such as West Virginia University’s John Hu are hard at work developing portable units that capture and convert natural gas into environmentally safer marketable materials like hydrogen and solid carbon. Hu and his research partner Xingbo Liu won one of 14 Department of Energy grants in 2020 to build technology that mitigates flaring and venting.

Hu said companies will be more inclined to buy into technology like his if and when the government puts more pressure on companies that flare.

“Sooner or later they’ll be in trouble” Hu said of companies that flare. “It depends [on] how much of the regulatory pressure.”

Poor data no incentives

The problem of excessive flaring and venting begins with “how little we know about the actual amounts” of methane being released said Barry Rabe a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

“Reporting on methane is done on the honor system” he said.

While most of the federally designated top-flaring states require oil and gas companies to report the volume of gas they combust state officials have little sense of those reports’ accuracy and none use satellite data to confirm company-reported flaring totals the Howard Center found. Additionally satellite data picks up only the heat signatures from flaring and cannot detect how much natural gas is being vented. Specialized infrared imaging technology is able to measure the invisible emissions that come from venting though it’s not yet widely deployed.

Patrick Courreges the communications director for the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources said his agency must take company reports at face value.

“When it comes to auditing vent and flare we don’t do it” Courreges said. “The system we have in place is not a good tool for actually determining how much methane is going out.”

Of the states the Howard Center analyzed four maintain little or no information on flaring and venting volumes. Officials in states like West Virginia and Kansas have argued that flaring is not commonplace but satellite data reveals that operators in those two states burned a combined total of 16 billion cubic feet of natural gas between 2012 and 2020. That’s equal to carbon dioxide emissions from energy use in over 100000 homes in one year according to an Environmental Protection Agency calculator.

In Oklahoma the nation’s fourth-largest gas producer in 2020 regulators also don’t know exactly how much companies are flaring and venting. Operators may release up to 50000 cubic feet of gas a day without permission from the Oklahoma Corporation Commission the state’s regulatory agency. The Howard Center built a database to track those extra flaring and venting requests and found that the total was dwarfed by the 32 billion cubic feet of flared gas alone that satellites captured between 2012 and 2020.

Poor or nonexistent data collection is compounded by a lack of statewide economic incentives to capture the gas. Rabe who also teaches environmental policy at the University of Michigan argues that severance taxes on natural resources would pressure oil and gas companies to use or sell natural gas instead of releasing it into the atmosphere.

“Unless there’s pressure politically regulatory standpoint or taxes you’re not going to invest in the equipment the metrics to catch all the gas” Rabe said.

Taxing flared gas would also bolster state revenues. Louisiana estimated that it would have received $801000 in severance taxes in fiscal year 2021 if it had taxed flared gas according to the state’s revenue department.

“From an economist’s perspective if you can measure it it would make sense to tax it” said Janie Chermak chair of the University of New Mexico’s economics department.

Of the top-flaring states only North Dakota and Alaska tax methane emissions Rabe said and most efforts to impose such taxes fail.

Texas Rep. Vikki Goodwin proposed unsuccessful legislation in 2021 that would have imposed a 25% tax on the marketable value of natural gas from flaring. “If we were to tax it when they release it then it might give them the incentive to go ahead and set up the infrastructure they need to sell it” the Democratic lawmaker from Austin told the Howard Center.

Goodwin represents the top oil and gas-producing state which has consistently flared the largest volumes of gas across the United States since 2013 according to satellite data. In fact Texas has flared more than the next top state North Dakota by margins that range from roughly 30 billion cubic feet to 93 billion cubic feet between 2013 and 2020.

But oil and gas companies are resistant to these taxes and some industry groups have even threatened that their companies would relocate to different states if such taxes were enacted.

Natural gas is burned off in a flare stack in McMullen County Texas on Oct. 25 2021. Between 2012 and 2020 oil and gas operators in Texas and a dozen other U.S. states collectively flared at least 3.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas according to a Howard Center analysis of satellite data.

Challenges to a centralized policy

A week after his inauguration President Joe Biden signed an executive order identifying climate change as a key domestic and foreign policy issue. The order included directives for federal agencies to reduce overall methane emissions from the oil and gas industry “as quickly as possible.”

The administration’s subsequent $1 trillion infrastructure bill which passed Congress in November 2021 initially contained ambitious climate change policies including a federally mandated fee on methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. But opposition from coal-rich West Virginia’s Sen. Joe Manchin quashed that effort.

The fee which would attach a pre-calculated cost to methane emissions from each producing basin for each calendar year was resurrected in the Build Back Better Framework touted as “the largest effort to combat climate change in American history.” That too hit a Manchin roadblock but negotiations continued into 2022.

“They’re more worried about the fact that in the legislation not just an executive agency but in legislation you would have to design a measurement and disclosure system that would have to be made more accurate to make that tax accurate” he said.

Industry groups also argued that the fee would disproportionately impact even operators with low emissions. But Rabe said that companies should not be absolved of the responsibility to implement environmentally conscious practices.

“Even at levels of small production there should be ways in my view to follow best practices on monitoring leak detection state-of-the-art equipment” he said.

Leyden of the Environmental Defense Fund concurred. Even low-producing oil wells taken as a whole emit large volumes of methane into the atmosphere and many of them are owned by big companies with “the resources to address the issue” he said.

In addition to the methane fee the EPA under Biden’s January executive order proposed new regulations that would require a reduction in flaring emissions from the oil and gas industry.

These rules set to be finalized in 2022 aim to eliminate venting and include a nationwide standard to limit natural gas flaring. Operators would be required to use the gas on the well site or transport it for sale. If neither option is available operators would be allowed to flare the gas only under the EPA’s 95% flaring efficiency standard. The EPA is taking steps to put record-keeping measures in place to ensure flares would function properly.

The Bureau of Land Management the agency responsible for regulating oil and gas activity on federal and tribal land is also moving to reduce methane emissions from the industry. In November 2021 the White House announced that the agency planned to regulate “excessive venting or flaring” by requiring operators to pay a royalty fee on gas flared or vented on federal and tribal land.

It’s unclear whether these federal efforts will be more successful than previous attempts to regulate the oil and gas industry. Over the last decade that sector has donated more than $20 million to Democratic and more than $100 million to Republican federal candidates and officeholders according to Howard Center calculations of campaign finance data from the watchdog group OpenSecrets.

In 2016 the BLM attempted to limit flaring and venting but states and fossil fuel companies killed those efforts through litigation.

Policy experts worry the same could happen again.

The U.S. Supreme Court has said it will review the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants in a case brought by West Virginia North Dakota and various coal companies.

Rabe predicts a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs could have “huge impacts” on the EPA’s authority to broadly regulate methane emissions.

Power imbalances in global supply chain contracts are commonplace. One example is Apple’s relationship with the world’s biggest electronics contract manufacturer Foxconn. With almost 1.3 million employees in mainland China Foxconn is the country’s largest private employer.

Over the past decade Foxconn has made headlines over its exploitation of employees and poor working conditions. Apple in turn has faced heavy public scrutiny for continuing to benefit from low labour costs which promote poor conditions and the unethical treatment of workers inside its iPhone factories.

Recently Apple put Foxconn's southern Indian factory on probation following protests after hundreds of women working at the plant and living in a hostel had to be treated for food poisoning a concern both the firms acknowledged and pledged to address.

With Foxconn predicting supply chain issues will persist through to the second half of 2022 many are wondering if Apple has taken any tangible steps towards improving its global supply chain and especially its reliance on cheap labour and low taxes in countries like China.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjIvMDIvMjYvYXBwbGUteW91dHViZS11a3JhaW5lLXJ1c3NpYS1wcmVzc3VyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Facebook Apple Twitter YouTube face pressure over Russia-Ukraine war,"The Washington Post Democracy Dies in Darkness

From ushering the fourth wave in the coffee industry to rising demand for bean-to-bar chocolates the space is seeing disruptions across categories.

Over the last few years another trend that seems to be picking steam is vegan meat or plant-based meat alternatives.

Two categories of people are giving a push to this trend — vegetarians looking to increase protein in their diets and non-vegetarians who want to gradually shift to a vegan lifestyle.

While the concept of plant-based meat or ""mock"" meat is a matured concept in the West with established brands such as ﻿Beyond Meat﻿ Archer Daniels Midland and Impossible Foods operating in this space for some time now the industry is at a nascent stage in India.

Today several companies in India are trying to crack the vegan meat code in India.

BodyFirst

When Pranay Jain set out on the path to healthy living little did he know the journey would reward him in ways he couldn’t have imagined!

During his college days at the Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies (NMIMS) he found himself consuming chocolates processed food and an incessant amount of sugar. From having an average weight he went on to weigh 96 kgs in the second year.

In 2013 he decided to take charge of his life and start on a fitness journey. Pranay joined his father’s business Gangwal Group in 2015 to handle international operations. Since the group was already operating in the healthcare and pharmaceutical spaces since 1987 he decided to launch the nutraceutical and supplements vertical in 2017.

Formerly called Body&U BodyFirst was started with an aim to make “India nutritionally responsible while providing authentic genuine and clinically researched products to the Indians” Pranay tells SMBStory.

The Mumbai-based brand offers a host of products such as plant protein KSM66 Ashwagandha vegan Flaxseed Oil Fenugreek fibre Astaxanthin probiotics whey protein My Crunch protein bar and more. Today ﻿BodyFirst﻿ is present in 45 cities – through offline and online channels.

The Burger Company

Neelam Singh was always a foodie by heart. It was her love for food that eventually led her to become an entrepreneur.

After working with Genpact and ICICI Lombard she quit her job in 2017 to start her own food business. She says she wanted to target another gap in the market by opening a fast-food chain for youngsters specifically preferably college and school students residing in Tier II and III cities.

“I grew up in Agra and there were not many places in those times where we could hang around” she says. Today fast-food chains across the country have considerably grown and Neelam hopes to carve a niche in this very market.

To set the ball rolling Neelam started a B2B business. “We took a small shop in the food court in one of the corporates converted it into a kitchen and supplied to corporates like Sapient (in Gurgaon). We offered mainly burgers and beverages.”

Seeing the burgers getting a good response Neelam felt encouraged to take this a step further to start her own fast-food business called ﻿The Burger Company﻿. In 2018 she opened an outlet in Palam Vihar Gurugram.

Since the pandemic the brand has scaled up to 42 franchisees and one outlet of its own. Following her dreams Neelam has also been able to expand to Tier II and Tier III cities like Baraut Loni Roorkee Bhiwani Rohtak Ujjain Aligarh and more. The larger plan is to open 100 more franchisee outlets by the end of the next fiscal year.

Kazo

Strolling through a mall or a high street market in metro cities it’s hard to miss a warm ambient store called ﻿Kazo﻿ known for its rich western designs. However not many would be aware that this international-sounding brand is in reality completely Made in India with its genesis in Delhi.

In an exclusive chat with SMBStory Deepak Aggarwal Founder CEO and Managing Director of KAZO says that after completing his graduation he wanted to do something of his own and not join the family business which led him to start a small garment export house in 1991.

Running this business for about 15 years gave Deepak a good understanding of the industry and he soon realised there was a wide gap in the western clothing market in India.

“There were no affordable high-street international fashion wear brands in India” he adds.

To address the gap and bring a new dimension to women’s fashion in India in 2007 Deepak started KAZO by investing about Rs 40 lakh of his own. Today Deepak claims the company clocks a turnover of Rs 100 crore with more than 170 points of sale across 70 cities in India.

Here's what we know so far,"Amid a raging war between Russia and Ukraine shipments of more than 350000 tonnes of cooking oil to India are at risk as logistics and loadings remain stuck at various ports. India the world’s largest buyer of sunflower oil with imports as high as 60 per cent of its needs is also the top purchaser of palm and soybean oils. Cooking oil prices in India may increase amid the Russia-Ukraine crisis.(Twitter/iatpapog)

Traders in the country have contracted imports of 550000 tonnes of sunflower oil from Ukraine and Russia for deliveries in February and March said a Reuters report citing Sandeep Bajoria president of the International Sunflower Oil Association.

Full coverage on Russia-Ukraine crisis

While 180000 tonnes of cooking oil managed to leave from the ports Bajoria said the fate of the rest was uncertain.

Cooking oil prices may surge

Ukraine and Russia account for nearly 80 per cent of the world’s sunflower oil shipments.

If the supply gets disrupted it increases the risk of a spike in cooking oil prices in the country. Consumer food prices already rose in January at the fastest pace in 14 months crippling household budgets for many despite relief in taxes and imposed stockpile limits. Prices remain elevated in line with a surge in global edible oil futures.

Follow all the latest updates

India bought 1.89 million tonnes of the crude cooking oil till October last year with Ukraine supplying 74 per cent of it while Argentina and Russia each accounted for about 12 per cent of the imports.

Global prices of vegetable oils used for everything from preparing cookies to frying potato chips to making shampoo have more than doubled in two years over supply constraints with palm and soybean oils surging to all-time highs this week due to supply jitters.

With the situation getting more complicated between the two countries with every passing day western nations have warned that Kyiv could fall if the fighting continues.

Several cooking oil companies have shut operations in Ukraine. Bunge Ltd. suspended business at two oilseed processing facilities Wilmar International Ltd’s joint venture shut its vegetable oil units in the country while Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. closed an oilseed crushing plant in Chornomorsk.

What will India do about it?

“World over there is going to be a shortage of sunflower oil and prices will rise” Bajoria told Reuters. He added that Indian importers are expected to wait for about a week before they switch to palm and soybean oil purchases to boost domestic supplies.

The ongoing war between Moscow and Kyiv is among the worst security crises that Europe has seen since World War II. According to reports the Ukrainian delegation has now agreed to meet with the Russian delegation for talks along the Ukrainian-Belarusian border.

He's a musician choreographer and recurring judge on RuPaul's Drag Race . He's pretty well known especially in the queer community.

Now if you're unfamiliar Celebrity Big Brother is basically a game show where contestants (celebs) are put in a house to compete for money. They are recorded in a live-stream format for viewers to watch.

Matt Winkelmeyer / Getty Images

And during his time on the show the “Nails Hair Hips Heels” singer raised some eyebrows with how he acted:

Matt Winkelmeyer / Getty Images

For starters people criticized this particular clip of him where he said he doesn’t personalize his Cameos and talked about how he arbitrarily charges for the videos.

People also pointed how insensitive it was that Todrick said “Don’t be too hard on me now” to model Shanna Moakler during a verbal altercation as this was allegedly the same thing a home invader said to Shanna.

In case you missed it Todrick Hall repeated the same terrifying thing that Shanna's home invader said to her in the most terrifying moment in her life which she told him earlier in the season. Here's a quick video recapping. #CBBUS3 #TodrickExposedParty 07:41 PM - 20 Feb 2022

And overall fans just seemed generally perturbed by the way he talked about people behind their backs this included drag queen Manila Luzon:

@IamCKirkpatrick voting for his son last night during the finale of @CBSBigBrother #BBCeleb3 was satisfying. Here's Todrick not realizing Auntie Karma was on her way.... 02:43 PM - 24 Feb 2022

Then there’s this clip of him talking about “torturing” someone vs. “shooting” them which had people like ??? um:

Lamar told him about a friend who was killed and Todrick thought the best thing to do was talk about how torture would’ve made more sense?? 14/ #cbbus3 #todrickexposedparty 12:51 PM - 22 Feb 2022

Celebrity Big Brother a As a direct result of his behavior on a #TodrickExposedParty hashtag was trending on Twitter over this past week with many fans already meme-ing the entire situation:

Ranking insurance companies is an inherently difficult process. On one hand all insurance companies pay out significant amounts of money in claims every year protecting clients from major losses in their lives.

See: The Hidden Truths About Life Insurance

Find: How To Find the Best Life Insurance Policy for You and Your Family

On the other hand insurance companies are for-profit businesses. This incentivizes them to deny claims when allowable. Thus every insurance company will have both supporters and detractors generally in the form of those who received payouts or had their claims denied.

Yet there are some objective standards by which life insurance companies can be evaluated including A.M. Best Ratings customer reviews level of complaints to the Better Business Bureau and claims-paying history. Using these as guideposts here's a list of some of the best and worst companies for life insurance.

Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/Shutterstock

Best: New York Life

New York Life is the largest mutual life insurance company in the United States and it ranked #67 on the Fortune 500 list for 2021. With a history running over 175 years the company is an institution in the life insurance industry and it carries the very best A++ rating for financial strength from A.M. Best.

U.S. News and World Report ranks the company #1 overall in terms of whole life insurance. The company is a premium life insurance provider though meaning you should generally expect to pay more for your policies.

This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats as presented in the recent SEC filings providing investors with a comprehensive understanding of AJG's market position and potential investment value.

Decoding Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (AJG): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Robust Brokerage Segment: AJG's brokerage segment is a cornerstone of its financial stability consistently generating the majority of the company's revenue. This strength is underpinned by a diverse client base ranging from middle-market entities to individuals and a wide array of insurance products. The segment's success is driven by AJG's ability to negotiate favorable terms with insurance companies reflecting its strong market position and negotiation leverage.

Strategic Acquisitions: AJG has a proven track record of successful acquisitions such as Willis Re Buck and Cadence Insurance which have expanded its service offerings and geographic footprint. These strategic moves not only enhance AJG's revenue streams but also provide cross-selling opportunities and access to new markets contributing to the company's growth and competitive advantage.

Financial Performance: The company's financial health is solid with the latest 10-Q filing indicating a healthy balance sheet. AJG's revenue and net income figures underscore its financial resilience and operational efficiency which are critical in maintaining investor confidence and supporting strategic initiatives.

Weaknesses

Integration Risks: While AJG's acquisition strategy is a strength it also poses integration risks. The assimilation of large acquisitions requires significant resources and management attention and there is always the potential for unforeseen liabilities such as cybersecurity issues or compliance violations. These risks could lead to financial strain and distract from core business operations.

Story continues

Dependence on Economic Conditions: AJG's performance is closely tied to global economic conditions. Factors such as high inflation increased interest rates and geopolitical instability can impact the insurance industry's risk-taking capacity and client demand for AJG's services. Economic downturns could lead to reduced revenues and pressure on profit margins.

Competition and Market Pressures: The insurance brokerage industry is highly competitive with constant pressure from both established players and new entrants. AJG must continually innovate and adapt to maintain its market share which requires ongoing investment in technology and talent retention.

Opportunities

Technological Advancements: AJG has the opportunity to leverage technology data analytics and artificial intelligence to enhance client services and internal efficiencies. By investing in technology-based solutions AJG can differentiate itself from competitors and offer value-added services to its clients.

ESG Initiatives: There is a growing emphasis on environmental social and governance (ESG) factors in the corporate world. AJG can capitalize on this trend by integrating ESG considerations into its service offerings and operations potentially attracting clients who prioritize sustainability and responsible business practices.

Emerging Markets: AJG can expand its presence in emerging markets where insurance penetration is typically lower and growth prospects are higher. By establishing a foothold in these regions AJG can diversify its revenue base and tap into new client segments.

Threats

Global Economic Volatility: AJG operates in a global environment that is subject to economic and geopolitical volatility. Events such as recessions political unrest or trade wars can disrupt markets and negatively impact AJG's operations and financial performance.

Regulatory Changes: The insurance industry is heavily regulated and changes in laws or enforcement policies can have significant implications for AJG's business model. Compliance with new regulations can be costly and time-consuming potentially affecting profitability.

Cybersecurity Risks: As a company that relies on data and technology AJG is vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. A significant data breach or cyber-attack could damage the company's reputation result in financial losses and lead to legal and regulatory consequences.

In conclusion Arthur J. Gallagher & Co (NYSE:AJG) exhibits a strong market position with a robust brokerage segment and a strategic approach to acquisitions. However the company must navigate integration risks economic dependencies and competitive pressures. Opportunities in technology ESG initiatives and emerging markets present avenues for growth while global economic volatility regulatory changes and cybersecurity risks pose significant threats. AJG's forward-looking strategies including leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses will be crucial in maintaining its competitive edge and ensuring long-term success.

Four human skeletons - all missing their hands and feet - had been discovered buried inside the villa of Hermann Goering.

The remains were found at Wolf's Lair in February. The area which is in modern-day Poland served as Hitler's chief headquarters from 1941-1944 when it was part of Germany.

The compound of about 200 Nazi bunkers and military barracks hidden in deep woods was the site of the failed assassination attempt on Hitler by Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg on 20 July 1944.

Wolf's Lair was destroyed by German Nazi forces as they retreated in early 1945 to prevent it falling into the hands of the approaching Soviet Red Army. What is left is now a tourist attraction.

Local Polish prosecutor Daniel Brodowski said police officers secured the remains after they were found by a local group Latebra which searches for historical objects.

A forensic investigation was carried out to try and establish if manslaughter had occurred but was discontinued due to a lack of evidence that a crime had been committed he said.

Then the suspect’s relative is found dead in the gunman’s home,"CNN —

An armed man gave no warning as he walked toward the front of Jesus’ Dwelling Place Church in Pennsylvania on Sunday raised a gun toward the pastor’s face and pulled the trigger.

What happened next may have been divine intervention Pastor Glenn Germany said.

“I’m thankful to God that I’m still here because he definitely pulled the trigger” Germany told CNN affiliate WTAE.

The gunman “attempted to shoot but the firearm failed to discharge” Pennsylvania State Police said in a statement.

The incident in North Braddock was captured on the church’s livestreamed video. Immediately after the gunman pulled the trigger a church member tackled the suspect to the ground.

Police say Bernard Polite tried to shoot a pastor in North Braddock but the gun wouldn't discharge. Jesus' Dwelling Place Church

State police identified the suspect as 26-year-old Bernard Junior Polite.

It’s not clear why the suspect tried to shoot the pastor. Germany said he had never seen the gunman before Sunday WTAE reported.

“All of a sudden I just seen a gun pointing right at me” the pastor told the affiliate. “And at that point all I could do was run for cover.”

As Germany ran and hid behind a lectern the church’s cameraman rushed the gunman and tackled him to the ground according to WTAE. The pastor quickly emerged from behind the lectern and helped subdue the suspect.

Polite faces charges of attempted criminal homicide aggravated assault and recklessly endangering another person court records show.

He was arraigned early Monday morning and was denied bail. He is being held at Allegheny County Jail and his preliminary hearing is scheduled for May 13.

It was not immediately clear if Polite has an attorney.

After the attempted shooting at the church police found the body of a man who was shot in Polite’s home Allegheny County police told CNN. The homicide victim was identified as 56-year-old Derek Polite a relative of the suspect from the church incident.

“County Police can confirm Bernard Polite a suspect in a previous incident Sunday morning at a North Braddock church is known to live at the residence where the shooting occurred and is a relative of the shooting victim” police spokesperson Jim Madalinsky told CNN in an email.

“At this point no charges have been filed in connection with the homicide and it remains an active investigation.”

A makeshift United defence that included Casemiro at centre-back was easily picked apart by Palace on several occasions as Jean-Philippe Mateta and Tyrick Mitchell joined the scoresheet in the impressive win.

- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga Bundesliga more (U.S.)

United remain in eighth place with 54 points from 35 games two points behind Newcastle United in sixth with their hopes of European football next season fading fast. Palace are still in 14th with 43 points from 36 matches.

United had several injury absentees and were without Bruno Fernandes the first time in his 230-game Old Trafford career he has missed a match with injury but the ease with which they were beaten will be a huge concern for everyone at the club.

""A big disappointment. We just had an off-day and we weren't in it"" midfielder Christian Eriksen told the BBC. ""It is what it is. We can't really change the injury things. We have to do what we can on the pitch to change it.

""Today it didn't matter who we played. Everyone could have done better. We tried to do what we could but we were not good enough. We'll take the blame as players.""

It is the first time in the Premier League era United have lost 13 games in a season and the scoreline might have been worse.

Palace have found their groove under new manager Oliver Glasner but United are limping to the end of a season that cannot finish soon enough for Ten Hag.

The home side took the lead inside 12 minutes and it was far too easy. Olise collected a throw and evaded a limp challenge from Casemiro and with no United player attempting to close him down was able to unleash a low shot from just inside the box.

United had the ball in the back of the net from Casemiro's header but the effort was ruled out after contact from Rasmus Højlund on Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson.

It was 2-0 to the home side five minutes before the break as Mateta breezed past United defender Jonny Evans and thrashed the ball into the net for a ninth goal in 11 games since the arrival of Glasner in February.

The striker had scored 11 goals in his previous 80 games for Palace.

United's defence was struggling to contain the movement of their hosts and when Diogo Dalot failed to deal with a ball to the back post Mitchell had a tap-in with home players queuing up to score.

Olise's second goal added more salt to the wound and it could have been worse for the visitors as Odsonne Édouard saw his shot come back off the woodwork late on.

""I think we could have got a few more.

At launch it lacked many features that statisticians and spreadsheet users came to expect based on decades of Microsoft Excel use. While it’s not even close to Microsoft’s offering even today depending on who you ask or how fancy they need to get with it Sheets is still pretty incredible.

One of my favorite tools is the ability to automatically autofill data to simplify life and streamline workflows. Today I’m going to show you how to do exactly that with dates numbers and even formulas so let’s get started!

advertisement

Note: Before we get started you’ll need to make sure that Autocomplete is enabled in your Sheet. To do this just visit “Tools” at the top of the screen and then “Autocomplete”. Then check “Enable auto-complete”.

Before we begin: Understanding lists and series

Alright this is pretty straightforward. In order to use autofill you’ll need at least two cells in a column or a row pre-filled with text numbers or dates. If you’ve met that requirement you should also know that dates and numbers will autofill consecutively while text will autofill based on patterns.

advertisement

Let’s say for example that you have days of the week listed. In the video below you’ll notice I wrote out Sunday and Monday. Google Sheets is smart enough to know that while auto-filling data you want to complete the week so that’s what it will do.

advertisement

However if you type in two colors in text format or something else that’s not traditionally listed for productivity purposes like a date would be you’ll only get that text repeating in a pattern. For example if you typed out red and blue it would just copy and paste “Red” and “Blue” over and over again because there’s no commonly accepted or utilized list or pattern for colors.

Drag the blue “Fill handle” at the bottom right of the box!

How to use Google Sheets Auto-complete

With that out of the way let’s do a little practice and figure out how to autofill text numbers and formulas. After typing out two dates or days of the week or even two numbers all you’ll have to do is click and drag over them (either horizontally or vertically however you’ve listed them). Then you’ll see a blue box around your entire selection and a little blue square at the bottom-right side of that selection.

advertisement

Click and hold the blue “fill handle” with your left mouse button and drag to the right or down depending on how you’ve listed your data. Once you let go you’ll see the series or list continue intelligently!

advertisement

As a quick note you can also use this to fill down formulas or calculations as well. Simply take the cell with a sum total or formula in it and drag the fill handle to apply that calculation to all of the cells. See below for a great example from Spreadsheet Point.

I just want the steps! 1. Type at least two numbers dates or formulas in a list or series

2. Highlight at least two cells in the series

3. Grab and drag the “fill handle” at the bottom right of the selection using the left mouse button

4. Let go of the left mouse button and watch magic happen

5. Thank your AI overlords

Oil industry drilling rig counts document a recent slowdown in California at a time when such activity has increased elsewhere. They also show along with numbers from other sources how much things have changed since oil prices last topped $100 per barrel in mid-2014.

Oil field service company Baker Hughes reported the number of drilling rigs active nationwide dropped by three-quarters in the two years after 2014 when supply flooded the market. But since mid-2020 there has been a steady rise from 200 to more than 500.

In California the crash was steeper — a drop of as much as 91 percent from 2014 to 2016 to as few as four active rigs. After mid-2020 the number rose from four to as high as 10 but since November it has remained at seven according to Baker Hughes.

Another view comes California Employment Development Department figures showing oil and gas extraction in Kern County employed 54 percent fewer people in the second quarter of 2021 than it did seven years earlier when the category had 3219 workers. There were also at 37 31 percent fewer companies doing the work in early 2021.

EDD data from that period also points to a 36 percent drop in the number of people working in local oil and gas drilling and a 52 percent decline in industry support workers. Reported totals in those two categories were 1184 and 3062 respectively in the second quarter of last year.

California's reliance on foreign oil has increased during that same time but not vastly.

According to the California Energy Commission the share of imported oil refined in California not including that which came from Alaska went from 51.6 percent in 2014 to 58.4 percent in 2019.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Carolina Public Press

A new crypto mining facility in Fayetteville will be among the city’s top 10 power consumers when it starts operations in August.

California-based Plan C Crypto will operate an old 20000-square-foot industrial facility located near the Fayetteville Regional Airport. It will operate at 5000 kilowatts according to the company and the Fayetteville Public Works Commission.

PWC doesn’t release specific power consumption information on businesses without consent but the facility’s electrical draw will put it in the company of PWC’s top customers including Cape Fear Valley Medical Center Fayetteville State University Fayetteville Technical Community College and Walmart among others.

Many critics consider the industry’s high carbon emissions to be wasteful contributing to climate change and rising global temperatures.

Lee Reiners a researcher at Duke University who studies financial technologies such as cryptocurrency is among those critical of a business plan for which he sees no legitimate financial utility in its future.

“Cryptocurrency provides no useful economic function” he said. “Anything that is an input into that process is not useful. It is wasteful. That’s my opinion with crypto. There’s no there there.”

Why crypto is so power-hungry

Instead of operating through financial institutions which verify monetary transactions among other things cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin operate outside of this structure.

Cryptocurrency transactions are verified through a process called proof of work where multiple entities on a network will verify withdrawals and deposits in the crypto space in essence cutting out the need for a centralized bank.

This process of verification is called mining and once a majority of computers on the network have confirmed the transactions it’s updated to a public ledger known as the blockchain.

“Everyone has the same exact copy of the ledger and everyone agrees on the canonical state of the ledger” Reiners said. “And that’s made possible by mining.”

Mining is incentivized Reiners said as miners like the one coming to Fayetteville are given a certain amount of bitcoin or whatever cryptocurrency they are mining for participation in the verification process.

“You need to incentivize this mining because otherwise anyone with 51% of the computing power on the blockchain network could just make up whatever they wanted on the ledger” he said.

“So you impose a cost and you impose that cost in the form of energy consumption. You have to solve this complex mathematical puzzle.”

Solving that puzzle is what requires so much energy.

According to reporting from The New York Times last year the collective process of verifying Bitcoin transactions annually uses up more energy than the entire country of Finland.

It’s seven times more than all of Google’s global operations.

‘There’s an opportunity cost to all this’

Plan C Crypto CEO Antonio Bestard said he founded the company as a means to provide more clean energy to the power grid. He said his company would provide an incentive for Fayetteville to buy more energy that is carbon neutral.

“I’m creating an economic need for more green energy on the grid” he said. “We found an economic way to help the city of Fayetteville help green their grid over time.”

When asked Bestard would not specifically say how this process would work beyond imploring Fayetteville to find more green energy.

“We look forward to working with the city of Fayetteville on how they procure power” Bestard said. He said he has asked the city to run the mining facility with 100% clean energy.

And it’s not just Fayetteville. By the time the miner there is up and running Bestard said there will be facilities in Tarboro Wilson and Boone.

But providing exclusively green energy is not something Fayetteville or any of those municipalities can promise.

According to PWC the city purchases almost all of its power from Duke Energy which has a near-monopoly over the power grid in North Carolina.

While Duke Energy has a goal of 50% carbon emissions reduction by 2030 and net-zero by 2050 the company has a long way to go.

In 2020 7% of electricity generated by Duke Energy was wind solar and hydroelectric. The company’s projections have that number at 23% by 2030.

Nuclear energy which is also carbon-free made up 35% of electricity generation in 2020.

That still puts carbon-emitting energy at nearly 60%.

Reiners said the claim that crypto incentivizes green production has no basis.

“I hear this argument a lot” he said. “‘Oh cryptocurrency incentivizes the production of green energy.’ I mean there’s no basis of fact to make that claim.”

Even if Plan C Crypto’s facility operated 100% carbon free Reiners said green energy could be used for something with a legitimate economic purpose.

“There’s an opportunity cost to all this as well” he said.

More revenue for Fayetteville with no investment

While Plan C Crypto’s facility will become one of the top power consumers in Fayetteville Bestard said the miner will not run during peak demand hours when energy consumption and costs are at their highest.

Fayetteville PWC CEO Elaina Ball said no additional infrastructure will be needed to accommodate the mining facility. Most importantly it won’t require any peaker plants large power generating facilities that often use cheaper energy like coal or natural gas during peak hours.

Ball said Plan C Crypto will provide needed revenue due to the high amount of power it will purchase.

“By adding a … 5-megawatt consumer like this what that does is our retail sales are going to go up” she said.

“We’re going to have higher usage 24/7 outside of that window right that peak window. When you generate more revenue off of our system that exists like an industrial customer like this it helps offset the cost to serve residential customers in the long run.”

Robert Van Geons CEO of the Fayetteville Cumberland County Economic Development Corporation or FCEDC said that despite criticisms of the crypto industry the new facility will be good for the area.

“It brings jobs. It brings taxable investment it’s beneficial for our utility system. And ultimately regardless of how you feel about cryptocurrency it is an emerging technology that will continue to evolve” he said. “We’re going to continue to have newer and newer technological innovations in this country and we want those to happen here in Fayetteville and Cumberland County.”

Bestard said the facility will initially employ 19 people targeting military veterans. Those jobs will be in the electrical security and information technology fields.

He said the lowest-paid employees will make $40500 a year while a majority will be in the $60000 to $100000 range.

Bestard said he anticipates dozens more jobs in the coming years.

Van Geons said that no economic incentives were made to Plan C Crypto and there is no financial investment from either the city or county.

Ball said that beyond the typical costs for attaching a new customer in the power grid there will be no significant costs for PWC.

The uncertain future of crypto

In a press release introducing Plan C Crypto to Cumberland the FCEDC cited market statistics projecting cryptocurrency to grow by move than 100% by 2028.

But Reiners said that projected growth is speculative.

“The only reason people buy (cryptocurrency) is they think they can sell it to someone else for a higher price in the future” he said.

“It’s been around for a while. It’s been since 2009. So now we’re 13-plus years. How has it impacted a product a service a process that we all use right? It hasn’t. And so if it hasn’t happened yet you have to ask yourself when it’s going to happen.”

He described the industry as a bubble based solely on the speculative value of what someone else is willing to pay for a product that hasn’t proved its value in his view.

“You’re relying on greater fools showing up and eventually the supply of greater fools is exhausted” Reiners said. “And they don’t show up.”

He said cities like Fayetteville should not be encouraging crypto companies to come to their area in any way.

“Crypto is a cancer” Reiners said. “You’re making a deal with the devil.”

He cited crypto miners buying up cheap carbon-based power in upstate New York as reported by The New York Times.

Reiners said he wouldn’t be surprised if the facility in Fayetteville didn’t exist after five years.

Even if the company fails though Ball said it’s not a risk for the community.

“If I were building a power plant to support this that would be a huge risk but we’re not because they’re not increasing capacity …” she said.

“They’re not increasing the demand. So this is just sales. We’re not putting in a power plant to support this because they can move out of the demand window …

“I know other people in other communities want to have their own perspectives on the industry that’s fine. But I wear the hat of what’s right for our community and our customers and this is good.”

The Delhi Metro has set the ball rolling on a visionary project that seeks to integrate its regular services with e-commerce via cutting-edge digital platforms with the DMRC hiring a top consulting firm to work on the plan official sources said.According to the vision for instance a rider may be able to order a product online while travelling in a metro train and will be able to get it at the destination station through advanced digital platforms of the urban transporter.""We have started working on this vision and a top consulting firm McKinsey has been hired to work on the plan that we have envisioned"" a top official source told PTI.However the project is still in its ""infancy"" and this is just a broader vision to upgrade our digital platforms so that commuters can also access e-commerce services while riding a Delhi Metro train he said.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) had recently launched its revamped website and mobile app giving commuters more facilities and ease while using metro services DMRC chief Mangu Singh at the launch had also said that the urban transporter is planning to integrate its digital platforms with ""e-commerce in a big way"" to allow commuters to get other services in the course of their journey.""In the next two-three years we think this is likely to go on a next level"" he had said.According to sources the plan is to let a commuter also access e-commerce services via DMRC digital platforms while on the go.""According to the vision once a commuter ends his or her journey the order placed say for grocery or something else can be completed at the destination station where there could be arrangements for say a digital locker which could be accessed with an OTP received on mobile or something like that. Though it's all in infant stage as of now"" the source said.The DMRC had earlier claimed that it's upgraded website is ""among the world's most feature-rich and advanced"" interactive digital platforms on metro railway. Riders of Delhi Metro using its newly-revamped mobile application can now get a prior alert notification when the next station on the route of the train journey is their destination officials said.Also using the newly-upgraded website anyone can get real-time information on their planned journey route including as to whether if their is any snag or interruption on the route ahead and will even suggest an alternative route.Giving a major push to 'Digital India' Delhi Metro has started the process to upgrade all its existing Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) systems to be compliant with the National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) services and the work is expected to be completed by June 2023.The DMRC has entered into a contract with a consortium for executing the NCMC along with upgrade of complete ecosystem consisting of AFC system which will also enable travel though ""QR-based tickets account based ticket and near field communications (NFC) media"" the DMRC said on Friday.On December 28 last year Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched the NCMC services on the Airport Express Line.This service also enables passengers from any part of the country to use their NCMC-compliant RuPay debit card for seamless travel. The same card can also be used for shopping banking transactions etc. across the country.DMRC's system will be able to accept transactions from 23 banks through the RuPay debit card issued by them officials had then said.",,,,,,,,,

Since the prepaid card’s arrival more than 20 years ago numerous industry participants have experienced high-profile snafus.

The latest is Bank of America which is under investigation by federal banking regulators in connection with its role as the exclusive provider of prepaid debit cards to recipients of government benefits in California.

Both at BofA and elsewhere in the prepaid industry the exploitation of cards by fraudsters has sometimes caused headaches. Other problems stemmed from technology glitches that temporarily prevented cardholders from accessing their money.

What follows is a look at seven instances since 2010 of prepaid card companies that encountered large-scale consumer-related problems.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vcWNpdHltZXRyby5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8yNy93aXRoLTM1LXBhdGVudHMtdW5kZXItaGlzLWJlbHQtY2FtZXJvbi13YWRsZXktaXMtYS10b3AtaW52ZW50b3ItYXQtYmFuay1vZi1hbWVyaWNhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With 35 patents Cameron Wadley is a top inventor at Bank of America,"Bank of America announced a “record-breaking year” for patents in 2021 with 512 patents granted across various technology categories a 16% increase from 2020.

Cameron Wadley a technology senior vice president is part of that trend. He recently filed patent applications related to the valuation of non-fungible tokens a type of digital ledger used to establish ownership of virtual assets.

With 62 patents filed and 35 issued Wadley is one of the company’s “top inventors” Bank of America said in a statement.

“What drew me to technology in the first place was the appeal of solving problems creatively” said Wadley who holds a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the University of Virginia and a master’s degree in business from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Q. You recently filed patent applications related to the valuation of non-fungible tokens. Without getting too technical what are non-fungible tokens?

In a nutshell non-fungible tokens are certificates of authenticity for real or virtual items. They can be used to demonstrate proof of ownership.

Q. You’ve been issued 62 patents since joining Bank of America. Again without getting too technical what are some of the others?

Some of my other patents help clients monitor their children’s spending enrich their interactions with the bank virtually and assess retirement readiness across their extended families.

Q. Do you think of yourself as an inventor?

I think of myself more as a problem solver than an inventor. Sometimes the problems in need of solving are of the garden variety and other times they require thinking outside the box.

Q. When you are issued a patent in a corporate setting do you benefit financially? Do you own it? Can you license that patent to others?

Providing innovative solutions for our clients is the day-to-day responsibility of all employees at Bank of America. We do recognize and celebrate our inventors; however the bank retains the rights to the patents filed by employees for bank innovations. Innovation is factored into employees’ overall job performance which helps drive employee compensation.

Q. What do you find most satisfying about your work?

The most satisfying aspects of my work are the culture of working together to solve meaningful problems and the knowledge that the ideas we come up with benefit clients on a very large scale.

Q. What advice would you give to a student or young professional who might be interested in this career path?

Do not allow your insecurity to deter you…every expert was once a novice. Some of the things we take for granted today once sounded ridiculous (e.g. cordless phones computers that fit in your pocket electronic payments). There will always be a desire for real problems to be solved so the real question is whether you are brave enough to wonder “What if.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL2hlYXJ0bGFuZC5vcmcvcHVibGljYXRpb25zL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC1pbnN0aXR1dGlvbnMtYXJlLWV4cGFuZGluZy1lc2ctc29jaWFsLWNyZWRpdC1zY29yZXMtdG8tdGFyZ2V0LWluZGl2aWR1YWxzLXNtYWxsLWJ1c2luZXNzZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are Financial Institutions Using ESG Social Credit Scores to Coerce Individuals Small Businesses? – The Heartland ...,"Environmental social and governance (ESG) metrics are a kind of social credit system designed to coerce businesses—and by extension individuals and all of society—to transform their practices.

Through a carrot-and-stick approach investors and banks (and soon governments) use ESG to push businesses to change how they function regardless of what the employees and customers of those businesses want. In many cases however corporate executives are all too willing to go along because they want access to the cheap capital offered by investors and financial institutions.

The widespread adoption of ESG metrics which is also commonly called “stakeholder capitalism”—is meant to radically alter how businesses are evaluated expanding considerations beyond traditional economic metrics like profit revenue debt customer satisfaction and product development.

Instead of looking at economic and financial considerations ESG social credit metrics measure things like “Percentage of active workforce covered under collective bargaining agreements” (union labor) and “Percentage of employees per employee category by age group gender and other indicators of diversity (e.g. ethnicity).”

(To learn more about the basics of ESG read my ESG primer here or watch my recorded presentation for The Heartland Institute here.)

Unlike many corporations which spend substantial time and resources self-reporting ESG individual investors and most small businesses typically do not produce their own ESG reports. Instead large financial services companies and banks have produced them for these groups often without individuals or businesses asking for the reports.

For instance Merrill Lynch a division of Bank of America produces ESG scores for all or nearly all of its individual investment accounts even for those whose value is $1000 or less.

Moody’s has created an “ESG Score Predictor” that offers users with ESG reports for 100000 businesses many of which have never produced their own ESG metrics. Moody’s algorithm predicts scores by using “company size location and industry as inputs.”

When individuals and small businesses have raised concerns about the use of ESG and how it could be used against them—as opposed to merely being applied to corporations for the benefit of investors—banks investment groups and their lobbyists have claimed that concerns over ESG are nothing but “conspiracy theories.”

However the evidence shows that there are very good reasons to believe that financial institutions and banks plan to dramatically expand the use of ESG soon for individuals families and small businesses a move that would dramatically change the U.S. economy and society. Below are the five most important reasons for all Americans to be concerned.

1. There Are Already Many Examples of Individuals and Businesses Being Denied Access to Financial Services or Capital Based on Subjective Criteria

It’s impossible to know to what extent individuals organizations and businesses are now being denied access to financial services including loans based on subjective criteria because there are no databases nor reporting agencies tasked with compiling denials based on non-financial reasons. However news outlets have reported many examples of such actions and some industry reports openly admit that discrimination is common.

For example Deutsche Bank AG and Signature Bank announced in early 2021 that would no longer provide services to former President Donald Trump or his business the Trump Organization purely for ideological reasons.

In November 2021 WePay a J.P. Morgan Chase-owned payment processor informed the Missouri-based Defense of Liberty political action committee that it would stop offering its services to the organization after it planned an event featuring Donald Trump Jr. (Chase later reversed the decision but only after “Missouri treasurer Scott Fitzpatrick threatened to have the state stop doing business with the bank.”)

According to former North Dakota lawmaker Bette Grande “During the 2021 legislative session in North Dakota representatives of the lignite industry testified that coal operations are seeing increasing insurance premiums and a drop in the number of insurance companies willing to write insurance for any price. This is the ESG movement in action and it will not stop with oil and coal.”

Also in 2021 Sustainalytics an ESG business owned by Morningstar published a report titled How Sustainable Finance is Shaping Change in Banking. In the publication Sustainalytics notes:

Most major banks screen their lending portfolios against specific ESG risks as per the OECD Due Diligence guidance and many embrace negative or positive screening for potential corporate lending transactions or project finance transactions. Screening strategies filter potential transactions using predetermined ESG criteria to rule companies in or out of contention for financing. Negative screening and norm-based screening involve the exclusion or avoidance of transactions not aligned with environmental social and ethical standards. Exclusion criteria often include issues like weapon manufacturing tobacco sales or production of fossil fuels. While negative and norm-based screening are the most popular techniques used for ESG asset management these practices have been losing traction since 2015.

Positive screening on the other hand selects corporate borrowers that score highly on ESG factors relative to their peers. This can include best-in-class screening or the inclusion of investments in companies and sectors with higher ESG scores as compared to their peers or companies that are actively improving their ESG performance. This screening method does not necessarily exclude ESG laggards but rather focuses on those performing best with regards to ESG in relation to comparable companies or industries. In comparison to corporate lending transactions the intensity of screening is often higher for project finance transactions given due diligence requirements under the Equator Principles.

In 2020 Wells Fargo suspiciously closed a bank account belonging to Lauren Witzke a 2020 Republican candidate for the Delaware Senate.

The Heritage Foundation noted in a 2021 report that “PayPal has admitted to closing accounts flagged by the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2019 now PayPal has announced a partnership with the left-leaning Anti-Defamation League to focus on ‘further uncovering and disrupting the financial pipelines that support extremist and hate movements.'”

In 2019 the New York Post reported that J.P. Morgan Chase closed bank accounts associated with several political activists and commentators including Enrique Tarrio Joe Biggs Laura Loomer and Martina Markota—all within weeks of each other. According to the Post the activists said they were not given clear explanations for the cancellations.

In 2018 some large U.S. banks including Citibank rolled out restrictions for gun manufacturers and retailers. According to a report by the New York Times “They are restricting their credit card and banking services to gun retailers and halting lending to gun makers that do not comply with age limits and background check rules determined by the banks. They are also freezing out businesses that sell high-capacity magazines and ‘bump stocks’ attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire faster even though such products are legal under federal law.”

2. Credit Agencies Have Started to Alter Businesses’ Credit Ratings Based on ESG Scores

As noted in a 2021 sweeping report by Fitch Ratings—one of the “big three credit rating agencies” (along with Moody’s and S&P)—corporate credit rating agents already take ESG scores into account. And according to Fitch and others the use of ESG to alter credit ratings will almost certainly expand in the months and years to come.

If the largest agencies are willing to use ESG to alter corporate credit scores why wouldn’t credit agencies and banks do the same for individuals and small businesses?

3. Analysts Predict Individual Credit Scores Could Soon Have an ESG Component

Perhaps the most widely used service to check the creditworthiness of individuals and small business is FICO. When banks and credit unions examine applications for loans FICO is often the first place they turn. In an article published in December 2021 on FICO’s website titled “Lending Predictions 2022: From BNPL to ESG (and More)” a FICO senior principal consultant wrote that he believes in 2022 “The ESG Agenda Will Drive the Search for Cleaner Decisions.”

“In financial institutions much of the ESG agenda is delivered at the corporate level” the analyst wrote “but in 2022 we expect to see an increased focus on bringing ESG data into more granular lending and investment decisions. This will require increased innovation in the use of alternative data across all kinds of lending. One example would be the inclusion of property energy ratings data in mortgage valuation and decisioning and CO2 emission data for small businesses.”

He also noted “Over the longer term we expect that ESG and climate risk evaluations will become an integral element of credit risk and affordability assessments.”

This is a clear admission that ESG will likely soon be applied to individual and small business credit scores and/or other considerations such as mortgage applications.

4. Large Investment Management Firms and Banks Are Using ESG to Coerce Corporations

The primary stated purpose of ESG is to change corporations especially the largest and most powerful ones in order to produce more extensive societal impacts. This point is not in dispute. Everyone who understands ESG regardless of whether they support it or not agrees that it’s being used to alter corporate activities.

If you’re looking for specific examples of this however a good place to start is Larry Fink’s 2022 “Letter to CEOs” in which Fink sings the praises of “stakeholder capitalism” and promises to use ESG scores as a way to alter society. Fink is the head of Blackrock the world’s largest asset management company and is widely considered one of the most powerful people on Wall Street if not the most powerful person.

Of course Fink attempts to put a happy face on ESG and stakeholder capitalism throughout his letter but even he can’t help himself when discussing climate change making it clear that companies must choose between being leaders or being dragged into a net-zero economy against their will.

“Every company and every industry will be transformed by the transition to a net zero world” Fink wrote. “The question is will you lead or will you be led?”

The threats from Fink and others have largely worked. Accounting firm KPMG reports thousands of companies in dozens of countries have ESG systems in place including 82 percent of large companies in the United States. (And this data is now a couple of years old.)

If investors and banks are willing to utilize ESG to control corporations why wouldn’t they use ESG to manipulate individual and small business behavior as well?

5. Banks Have Promised to Use ESG to Fight Climate Change Throughout All of Their Portfolios and Business Activities

The largest and most influential banks and financial institutions in the United States much of Europe and Canada have openly said that they will use their tremendous amount of wealth to force the global economy to move to net-zero by at least 2050 and to halve CO2 emissions by 2030. This will be done in a variety of ways including by “accelerating decarbonization in the real economy by describing financial sector expectations of transition plans from the companies the sector engages with and finances.”

One of the largest groups of banks and financial institutions promising to make such an extreme acceleration is the Glasgow Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ). There are already “over 450 financial firms across 45 countries responsible for assets of over $130 trillion” in GFANZ including numerous large U.S. banks such as Bank of America J.P. Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo & Company.

There simply is no way for banks to keep their promises related to a transition to net-zero without imposing ESG metrics or other similar criteria on individuals and small businesses.

“Putin's government is getting kicked off the international financial system” a senior Biden administration official told reporters on Saturday. “To be clear this is a sad outcome for the people of Ukraine the people of Russia and many others. This is not where we want it to be. But this is Putin's war of choice and only Putin can decide how much more cost he is willing to bear—the United States and our allies and partners are unified and will continue to impose costs.”

The decision to remove the Russian institutions from SWIFT was announced in concert with the European Commission Britain Canada France Germany and Italy. In a Saturday statement the group of allies warned that a list of five moves aim to “hold Russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for Putin.”

“As Russian forces unleash their assault on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities we are resolved to continue imposing costs on Russia that will further isolate Russia from the international financial system and our economies the group said in a statement. “We will implement these measures within the coming days.

The allies also pledged four other moves they are: leveling “restrictive measures that will prevent the Russian Central Bank from deploying its international reserves”; taking steps to limit the issuance of foreign passports to wealthy Russians; launching a transatlantic task force that will among other things target the wealth of Russian officials and elites. And finally the group pledged to “step up our coordination against disinformation and other forms of hybrid warfare.”

The administration official said the de-SWIFTING of Russian banks which the White House had been resisting for days will be felt immediately in Moscow. And he said Washington is prepared to escalate further if Moscow does.

“What we're committing to do here is to disarm the central bank” he said. “And the way we can do that for example is by preventing U.S. EU U.K. persons from selling rubles to the Central Bank of Russia. That means very simply the Russian Central Bank can’t support the ruble—full stop—and that means our sanctions will have much greater force. There are other measures too we can take against the central bank and you'll be hearing more about that later.”

Sanctions to date

The United States announced Friday that it would freeze the assets of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov following similar steps taken by the European Union and Britain as nations around the world sought to tighten sanctions against Russia's government over its invasion of Ukraine.

Britain's government took the same action Friday with Foreign Secretary Liz Truss writing on Twitter ""We will not stop inflicting economic pain on the Kremlin until Ukrainian sovereignty is restored.""

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the move by the U.S. the European Union and Britain sends ""a clear message about the strength of the opposition to the actions"" by Putin.

A Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the sanctions against Putin and Lavrov reflect the West's ""absolute impotence"" when it comes to foreign policy according to the RIA news agency.

World leaders are rarely the target of direct sanctions. The only other leaders currently under EU sanctions are Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad according to Agence France-Presse.

The EU sanctions against Putin and Lavrov are part of a broader sanctions package that targets Russian banks oil refineries and Russia's defense industry.

EU leaders agreed however it was premature to impose a travel ban on Putin and Lavrov because negotiating channels need to be kept open.

Russia responds

In response to the sanctions Russia has taken its own measures including banning British flights over its territory after Britain imposed a similar ban on Aeroflot flights.

The United States and several allies had imposed a first tranche of sanctions Tuesday after Putin declared the disputed eastern Ukraine regions of Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states much as he appropriated Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014.

President Biden added another round of sanctions on Russia Thursday hours after Russia began its invasion of Ukraine declaring at the White House after meeting virtually with leaders of the G-7 nations and NATO that ""Putin chose this war and now he and his country will bear the consequences.""

NATO allies including Britain and the European Union also imposed more sanctions Thursday and the effects were felt almost immediately when global security prices plunged and commodity prices surged. Biden acknowledged that Americans would see higher gasoline prices.

Special to USA TODAY

This is Part 5 of a five-part story published in partnership with the Center for Public Integrity and Word In Black.

WATERLOO Iowa – When Matthew Gilbert heard about the Bank of Jabez it pinged an old memory: his great-aunt telling him that his great-grandfather had started a bank.

Gilbert an attorney who works on economic inclusion and talks regularly with ReShonda Young about how to move the needle in Waterloo started digging.

He found that his ancestor Dr. Lee Furgerson joined forces in 1947 with other Black community leaders to launch the Black Hawk Savings & Loan Association named after their county. It opened in the building where Furgerson practiced.

Perhaps this institution helps explain Waterloo’s huge jump in Black homeownership between 1940 and 1950. It’s hard to know because so few records are left.

Furgerson the first Black physician in the city died the year after the savings and loan’s founding the victim of an intestinal obstruction. He was just 49. Another of the four founding officers died two years after that.

Gilbert thinking of the health toll of discrimination and the wealth toll of lost working years looked for more details about the financial institution’s existence and couldn’t find anything beyond the late 1950s.

Young’s efforts looked to him like a new chance.

“Here in Waterloo it could be a really powerful example” said Gilbert tapped to be on the Bank of Jabez’s board.

As summer turned to fall Young continued talking with Stacey Bentley the Community Bank executive. She also pitched to individuals with money to invest some from out of state. She and her family went door-to-door in Waterloo neighborhoods some comfortably well off some not asking people to commit to opening accounts at a future Bank of Jabez.

In October came a turning point – for another prospective Black bank. Organizers in Columbus Ohio filed an application with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. seeking approval to open. They’re hoping to begin operating this fall.

Their Adelphi Bank might be the one to break the 22-year drought in Black bank startups.

But not most likely as a Black-owned bank. Instead it would be a Black-led one.

What is a minority bank?

Organizers are aiming to meet an alternative federal definition of a minority bank that’s based on board composition and communities served said Kevin L. Boyce an Adelphi co-founder. Even in Columbus 13 times the size of Waterloo and home to nearly a quarter-million more Black residents the money test looked formidable.

“That’s part of the challenge with wealth distribution in America” said Boyce a former Ohio state treasurer. “We’ve been fortunate to have other partners with us both institutional and individuals that are not minority that have joined in our efforts.”

NOT ENOUGH HOUSING:'A state of constant crisis': Black households struggle with rising rents and housing shortage

Though Waterloo has Iowa’s highest share of Black residents it’s modest enough – 18% – that a new bank would need to serve a broader demographic. Young was pretty sure the harder road was her only alternative: Just over half the money would have to come from Black individuals.

Thinking about the momentum she’d have if she could get the other 49% covered she drafted a pitch to give to Community’s parent company. In between meetings with Bentley to prepare she’s worked to recruit board members and executives.

For now the bank’s future remains a question mark. Will the money come? Can she launch it?

Young said she’s determined to get there. To see it open someday.

Which is why she’s already made an offer on a property for it.

Last summer Young visited a church property for sale in an east side neighborhood of small homes some in disrepair to see whether its kitchen could work for home-cooking entrepreneurs needing commercial-grade resources.

The 97-year-old brown brick building and an addition that once housed a parish school stretched nearly the length of a block with a parking lot and empty land on the other side of the street.

There was room not just for the home cooks but also for small businesses ready to rent their first space. She could imagine the Bank of Jabez across the street – 13 blocks from the former site of the Black Hawk Savings & Loan.

What she didn’t yet know: Fifteen years before she’d texted her cousin about a bank she felt God calling her to open the pastor of this church sat up in bed in the middle of the night with a vision from God to incubate five businesses on the property.

Pastor Faye Scott said she tried to make it happen but it never came to pass. Eventually her Ambassadors for Christ Church needed to sell this too-big home. An offer fell through. An auction drew no one. The boiler broke. The pipes burst.

And now here was Young explaining about the bank and the small businesses. Five of them already were interested. For Scott it was like a promise from God that the first vision was no mistake.

“I couldn’t help but get on board” Scott said.

She offered the entire property to Young for $22500.

An investment to fight inequality

Young amazed started digging into the old building’s challenges. She talked to her cousin and lawyer. On a warm September afternoon she returned in a Bank of Jabez T-shirt – “Experience Excellence” it said – to meet with Scott. In the sanctuary light filtering in through the stained-glass windows she handed the pastor a purchase agreement.

“Knowing that it’s yours” Scott asked “how do you feel?”

“I’m still very carefully suppressing emotions” Young admitted.

There were so many steps left that she needed to stay focused on not all of which the original list of 74 included.

The real estate deal wasn’t official yet and a legal battle over a mechanic’s lien on the property could upend things. Contractors weren’t getting back to her. The building needed a new heating system ASAP. Small businesses couldn’t move in until rooms were readied for them.

She didn’t want to tear her gaze from the path ahead by looking back at how far she’d come.

“It’s a time to rejoice” Scott insisted. With a mischievous smile she added“Just take a couple of minutes. Go ahead girl.”

Young didn’t have a couple of minutes. But for one unguarded second she let out a joyful laugh.

US bank BNY Mellon is planning to launch a digital asset custody platform to enable institutional clients to gain exposure to crypto.

The new custody platform will allow clients to hold the world’s most popular crypto currencies bitcoin and ether in BNY Mellon crypto wallets which will be supported by Fireblocks technology. According to BNY Mellon the launch of the new product later this year will make the investment bank “the first to enter the global digital custody space.”

“We announced last year that we were standing up for digital asset users” Katey Neate the chief risk officer for asset servicing and digital at BNY Mellon told City A.M.. “The idea is that we build a digital asset platform the cornerstone of which is custody that will enable the interoperability of traditional assets and digital.”

Confident

The 238-year-old bank has been taking increasingly confident strides into the crypto space after setting up a dedicated digital asset team a year ago. The new crypto custody product will first launch in the US before expanding to additional markets globally based on demand.

“I think what we’re seeing in the UK is that there’s a really vibrant and active digital assets market here” said Talia Klein the head of digital asset custody commercial products for BNY Mellon hinting that the service could be coming to Britain after an initial US launch.

According to Klein and Neate while the custody service will initially cater to just two digital assets the aim is to rapidly expand the service to include a range of tokenized traditional and digital assets subject to regulatory approvals.

“I think regulatory clarity is improving and people are feeling more confident because of that regulatory clarity” Neate said.

“It’s still not the Nirvana that we’re looking for but it’s at least easier to read the tea leaves now and understand what to look for when you’re developing a risk framework” she continued.

The HELP ONE project will yield a mix of supportive housing and low-income apartments and is among Brooklyn’s largest affordable housing projects announced this year.

The development and design team includes affordable housing developer HELP USA and Curtis + Ginsberg Architects.

This initial phase includes construction of the first two buildings referred to as “Building A” and “Building B.” Building A will comprise 184 homes ranging from one- to three-bedroom accommodations. Sixty percent of the units will be reserved for formerly homeless youth and families.

The collection of 71 apartments at Building B will comprise mix of studio and one-bedroom units. At this property 60 percent of the units will be reserved for formerly homeless adults with mental health issues and those in recovery from substance abuse.

Supportive services will be provided by HELP though the New York City 15/15 Program. Additionally Building A will be the new home of one of HELP USA’s non-residential community service programs HELP ROADS a counseling and support team that serves survivors of domestic violence.

“30 years ago we opened our first shelter on this site” said president and CEO of HELP USA Tom Hameline. “Since then we’ve worked tirelessly to serve communities and families who are under-resourced and under-served. We are so proud to stand on the spot where it all began with our partners at the state and city and continue that work.”

The HELP ONE complex will eventually comprise four buildings with more than 500 affordable apartments. On-site amenities will include a courtyard with a playground a dog park barbecue grills and open green space for picnicking and outdoor recreation.

To improve energy performance and efficiency throughout the complex energy-efficient windows fixtures and integrated solar arrays will be installed at every building.

Total construction costs hover around $129 million. Funding was provided by a coalition of governmental and private sources including the New York City’s Housing Preservation and Development the Housing Development Corporation the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority Bank of New York Mellon and Regions Affordable Housing.

HELP ONE was also awarded $1 million as part of New York State’s inaugural Buildings of Excellence Competition. The $40 million program selects and awards projects for advanced building design and design strategies that significantly reduce energy use and carbon emissions.

They first hoped to bring employees back in January but were derailed by the Omicron variant. Now the firm is targeting March 7.

“We noticed other employers were saying ‘We’ll be back in April.’ ‘We’ll be back in June.’ But we said we need some certainty” said Sean Woodroffe the head of human resources at TIAA which has 12000 U.S. employees. “This March 7 date is only the second time we announced a date.”

And Mr. Woodroffe is facing this new return-to-office date with optimism he explained seated at his desk in front of a glimmering cityscape high above what he described as the bustling “vibe” of Midtown Manhattan. After all the firm has a 98 percent Covid-19 vaccination rate employees have been supplied with at-home tests and the line at the Third Avenue Wendy’s has been inching longer during lunchtime.

“With Omicron we realized that we needed to pivot from thinking about coming back into the office when Covid vanishes” he said. “We recognized we have to pivot to how do you responsibly cope with Covid?”",,,,,,

But the Holburne Museum in Bath is staging a groundbreaking exhibition called Henry Moore in Miniature a collection of the great artist’s works that could fit into the palm of the hand.

The museum’s director Chris Stephens said its relatively small spaces meant one of the themes of its programme was to showcase the intimate in art – and the retrospective of mini Moores met the brief perfectly.

He said visitors to the exhibition which opened on Friday would be able to imagine Moore industriously working away in his studio finding new shapes and textures.

“The exhibition serves as a reminder that sculpture is as much an art of the hand – in its making and appreciation – as of the eye. An object may be small in size but large in scale” he said.

The show billed as the first of its kind features sculptures in stone wood terracotta plaster lead bronze and Plasticine and takes in themes recurrent in Moore’s work: the reclining female figure mother and child the human head the fallen warrior. It has works from every decade of his career from the 1920s to the 1980s.

The first piece the visitor encounters is a mother and child from the 1920s modelled in Plasticine which pleasingly was invented at the end of the 19th century by a teacher at Bath Academy of Art William Harbutt. It sits next to a small animal head made of boxwood in 1921.

Another intriguing display features of a pair of mother-and-childs from the 1930s modelled in plaster and cast in lead which Moore melted in saucepans on a kitchen stove. Stephens said the lead gave the pieces a “poisonous” air which perhaps reflected political times as the world headed towards war.

Seen in public for the first time is a collection of small terracotta heads that Moore modelled while planning two carved heads for a church at Much Hadham in Hertfordshire in the 1950s.

Stephens said: “These reflect his interest in classical traditions tribal masks and perhaps the graffiti carved into walls in Paris captured by the photographer Brassaï.” Moore’s fingerprints and tool marks are clearly visible in the heads.

The final displays are maquettes for yet more mother and child sculptures dating from the late 1970s and early 1980s and a cabinet of found objects from his studio that Moore worked with – bones flints stones.

Presented in partnership with the Henry Moore Foundation the exhibition features more than 60 works gathered in one room on the top floor of the museum. Moore’s daughter Mary Moore said she was delighted these smaller pieces would be seen.

She said: “An enormous amount of Henry Moore’s work – particularly the starting point for his universally familiar large-scale sculpture – began with his modelling with his turning moulding and forming in the palm of his hands.”

By way of contrast a second show that opened at the Holburne on Friday stars a very different artist – Sam Cox better known as Mr Doodle who has almost 3 million followers on Instagram sells his work for hundreds of thousands of pounds a time and has covered every inch of his Kent home with his intricate patterns.

Mr Doodle! Museum Mayhem is the first UK museum exhibition of his work with the Holburne allowing Doodle to take over parts of the building and daub it with his “graffiti spaghetti” of black ink on white background.

He has also been given the go-ahead to replace some of its pieces with his own work. For example John Constable’s Flatford Lock from the Bridge (circa 1814-17) has been replaced with Doodle House from the Gates (2024).

Doodle studied illustration at UWE Bristol and used to bring a suitcase of his work to Bath to try to barter for a meal or a drink. “That was mostly unsuccessful” he said. “It’s cool to come back and do something grander.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS0xMzM4NjQwNy9GV0FXLWZhbnMtc2xhbS1jcmluZ2UtYmF0aC1kYXRlLUZhcm1lci1Kb2UtQ2xhaXJlLmh0bWzSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtMTMzODY0MDcvYW1wL0ZXQVctZmFucy1zbGFtLWNyaW5nZS1iYXRoLWRhdGUtRmFybWVyLUpvZS1DbGFpcmUuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Farmer Wants A Wife fans slam 'cringe' bath date between Farmer Joe and Claire: 'It felt awkward watching it!',"Farmer Wants A Wife fans were left 'cringing' on Sunday night as they watched an awkward date between two of the contestants.

Farmer Joe was enticed to take a bath with Claire both of whom developed a connection with each other during their first 24-hour date together.

But while their latest date was meant to be a romantic scene viewers back home said they could hardly watch the pair fumble in the water reported Yahoo Lifestyle.

The cattle and sheep farmer 33 offered another 24-hour date up for grabs with the marketing manager 36 pulling out all the stops to win.

'I saw the bathtub near our tent so yeah I just wanted to set up a little spot for us to share some time together' Claire told producers.

Farmer Wants A Wife Australia fans said they were left 'cringing' away from the TV on Sunday night as they watched an awkward date between two of the contestants

However it seemed the plan 'fell flat' when awkward scenes showed the pair stripping down and stepping into the warm bath looking shy in front of the cameras.

The pair appeared uncomfortable sharing affections while in their underwear on TV but did attempt to share a kiss and caress one another in a cringey display.

'I couldn't watch the bath just a bunch of giggling it was so cringe' one person wrote on Facebook.

Another added: 'I know I felt awkward for watching haha not even a conversation going.'

'Yes it was so cringeworthy it was hard to watch' one user commented.

Others noted that it was only awkward because Farmer Joe did not appear to be as interested in Claire as she was him.

But while their latest date was meant to be a romantic scene viewers back home said they could hardly watch the pair fumble in the water reported Yahoo Lifestyle

One wrote: 'To me that date thing that Claire planned for Joe fell flat I honestly don't think he's feeling it for any of the women.'

'No he is not feeling it with any of them but well and truly enjoying the game!' another agreed.

Russia attacked Ukraine's capital Kyiv with missiles as troops moved into the country from multiple directions Thursday prompting international outrage. Bob's Liquor on N. Winston Road was already outraged: The store has boycotted Russian vodka for the last eight years.

Then-owner Bob Gilbertson pulled his stock of Russian vodka from the shelves in 2014 after Russia invaded Crimea. Gilbertson has since sold the store to his daughter Ashley Haun and the store has continued the boycott.

General manager Brittany Baxter said Gilbertson initially started the boycott because he felt Russia was bullying Ukraine.

""He didn't really care for that and took the position of boycotting them his own way. That was one thing he could do to help and he really stood by that"" Baxter said.

Baxter said Gilbertson hoped that other Knoxville retailers would follow suit but as far as she knows Bob's Liquor is the only store with a boycott like this.

Variations of the sign Gilbertson put up have stayed in the store's front window since the boycott began in 2014. An early version said the store wouldn't sell Russian vodka ""due to recent Russian aggression.""

The current iteration reads ""Due to Russian adventurism we will no longer sell Russian vodka.""

Neither Gilbertson nor any of the staff have personal ties to Ukraine but they felt the boycott was the right thing to do – even more so in the wake of Russia's most recent attacks

""Now we're happy that we have upheld it and we will continue to not sell Russian vodka"" Baxter said.

Baxter said the store has seen ""almost 100% positive feedback"" on their boycott following yesterday's invasion.

Bob's Liquor has been in business since 1972. When Gilbertson first pulled Russian brands off the shelf they turned to other brands.

WHAT WE KNOW:Why is Russia invading Ukraine? Could it be the start of WWIII? Here's what we know

Baxter said there are really only three Russian brands to look out for and they were easy to replace. For a time the store even sold a Ukrainian vodka. Much of their stock is Polish and even American.

""We're open to any country"" Baxter said. ""Just not Russia.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Buffett is eager to make one point clear about Berkshire Hathaway the conglomerate he controls: It is a good corporate American citizen.

In announcing Berkshire’s nearly $90 billion profit for 2021 on Saturday the billionaire stressed in his annual letter to shareholders the outsize role that the company — whose businesses run from the BNSF railroad to Geico insurance to See’s Candies — plays in the United States economy.

It is the latest effort by Mr. Buffett to wrap himself and his $713 billion company in the flag as it continues to be one of America’s most successful businesses. Last year proved to be good for Berkshire with the company reporting $89.8 billion in earnings more than double what it earned in 2020.

The earnings growth traces the rise in the broader economy as the United States and other countries rebound from the depths of the pandemic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8yNi9pbnZlc3Rpbmcvd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHQtYmVya3NoaXJlLWhhdGhhd2F5LXNoYXJlaG9sZGVyLWxldHRlci9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFhaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wMi8yNi9pbnZlc3Rpbmcvd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHQtYmVya3NoaXJlLWhhdGhhd2F5LXNoYXJlaG9sZGVyLWxldHRlcg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway posts nearly $40 billion profit,"New York CNN Business —

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reported a nearly $40 billion profit in the fourth quarter up more than 10% from the same period of 2020. Profits more than doubled for the full year to just shy of $90 billion.

Operating earnings Buffett’s preferred measure of profitability soared 45% in the fourth quarter to $7.3 billion and rose 25% for the full year to about $27.5 billion.

The company added it bought back $6.9 billion worth of stock during the quarter a move which also helped to boost its earnings per share.

Berkshire Hathaway released its latest results Saturday morning along with Buffett’s annual letter to shareholders and details about its in-person shareholder meeting in Omaha at the end of April. Berkshire Hathaway said attendees must show proof of vaccination for Covid-19 to attend.

Berkshire is booming

In the letter Buffett said 2021’s success was in large part due to its “four giants” the company’s insurance operations Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad its massive energy business and Berkshire’s nearly 5.6% stake in Apple (AAPL).

Apple is by far Berkshire’s largest holding and the stock enjoyed a total return (including dividends) of 35% last year. Buffett called Apple CEO Tim Cook “brilliant” in the letter.

Buffett said in the letter investors might be surprised to learn how much Berkshire depends on the American industrial economy for its success. Berkshire also owns Duracell batteries Benjamin Moore paints homebuilder Clayton and flooring company Shaw for example.

“Many people perceive Berkshire as a large and somewhat strange collection of financial assets. In truth Berkshire owns and operates more US-based ‘infrastructure’ assets – classified on our balance sheet as property plant and equipment – than are owned and operated by any other American corporation” Buffett wrote.

Buffett also pointed out Berkshire Hathaway paid $3.3 billion in federal income taxes last year as well as “substantial state and foreign taxes.”

“‘I gave at the office’ is an unassailable assertion when made by Berkshire shareholders” Buffett joked.

Wall Street has rewarded Berkshire for its strong results. The company is now valued at nearly $715 billion and its stock is not far from its all-time high. Berkshire is up 7% this year while the broader market has fallen as investors have flocked to value stocks as safe havens.

Buffett has benefited handsomely as well. His net worth is about $115 billion according to Forbes making him the eighth-richest person on the planet.

Annual meeting is back in Nebraska

Berkshire has nearly $147 billion in cash and generates a big chunk of its profits from Geico and its other insurance businesses. Berkshire’s A shares (BRKA) which famously have not split trade for nearly $480000 apiece.

The class B shares (BRKB) which trade at a more affordable price of around $320 are in the S&P 500 (SPX) and are more widely held by average individual investors.

Many of those shareholders are expected to descend on Omaha during the last weekend of April for Berkshire’s first annual shareholder meeting with attendees since 2019.

The meeting will take place April 30. Berkshire said Saturday Buffett and fellow vice chairman Charlie Munger; Ajit Jain who oversees the insurance operations; and Greg Abel who oversees the conglomerate’s non-insurance businesses will be there in person to answer questions.

The meeting will also be webcast on CNBC. Yahoo Finance had been the online home of the meeting previously.

The company’s 2020 annual meeting was virtual due to the pandemic while the 2021 meeting was held in Los Angeles in order to be closer to the home of longtime Buffett friend and business partner Munger who is 98 and lives in Southern California.

Buffett announced after last year’s virtual shareholder meeting Abel will be his successor as CEO.

In his annual letter to shareholders released on Saturday the 91-year-old investing legend listed Apple under the heading ""Our Four Giants"" and even called the company the second-most important after Berkshire's cluster of insurers thanks to its chief executive.

""Tim Cook Apple's brilliant CEO quite properly regards users of Apple products as his first love but all of his other constituencies benefit from Tim's managerial touch as well"" the letter stated.

The ""Oracle of Omaha"" made clear he is a fan of Cook's stock repurchase strategy and how it gives the conglomerate increased ownership of each dollar of the iPhone maker's earnings without the investor having to lift a finger.

""Apple – our runner-up Giant as measured by its yearend market value – is a different sort of holding. Here our ownership is a mere 5.55% up from 5.39% a year earlier"" Buffett said in the letter. ""That increase sounds like small potatoes. But consider that each 0.1% of Apple's 2021 earnings amounted to $100 million. We spent no Berkshire funds to gain our accretion. Apple's repurchases did the job.""

Berkshire began buying Apple stock in 2016 under the influence of Buffett's investing deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. By mid-2018 the conglomerate accumulated 5% ownership of the iPhone maker a stake that cost $36 billion. Today the Apple investment is now worth more than $160 billion taking up 40% of Berkshire's equity portfolio.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzFjMjc2NDU5LWZhYmYtNDM1Mi04NWQ0LTlhMmJlY2VkN2U2N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Berkshire Hathaway profits soar but Warren Buffett bemoans lack of good deals,Today's FT newspaper for easy reading on any device.

Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) Financial Results: Analysis

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A) reported Q4 FY 2021 earnings that exceeded analysts' expectations. Earnings per share (EPS) were up by 16.0% year over year (YOY) and 44.7% better than analysts' forecasts.

Revenues for Q4 2021 were $112.9 billion up by 9.1% YOY and beating the estimate by 33.1%. Note that this revenue figure is the sum of operating revenues from Berkshire's operating subsidiaries and the pretax gains on Berkshire's investments and derivative contracts. Also since Berkshire did not release a quarterly revenue figure for Q4 2021 on Feb. 26 2022 the $112.9 billion number was derived by taking the full-year 2021 revenue figure of $354.6 billion ($276.1 billion of operating revenues plus $78.5 billion of investment and derivative contract gains) from its 2021 annual report and subtracting the cumulative revenues of $241.7 billion computed by Visible Alpha for the first three quarters of 2021.

In Q4 2021 Berkshire Hathaway recorded an after-tax net gain of $32.4 billion on investments and derivative contracts. This was up by 5.0% from the figure of $30.8 billion recorded in the same period of 2020.

Operating earnings which exclude these gains were $7.3 billion compared to $5.0 billion in the same quarter of 2020. This was an improvement of 45.1% YOY and 15.9% above the estimates. The operating earnings figures that Berkshire reports are calculated after income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to non-controlling interests.

Berkshire spent approximately $6.9 billion on share repurchases (stock buybacks) in Q4 2021. This brought the figure for full year 2021 to about $27 billion.

Over the past year Berkshire Hathaway's shares have provided a total return of 23.2% outperforming the S&P 500's total return of 9.3%.

BRK.A Operating Earnings

For many years Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett has urged investors to focus on Berkshire's operating earnings from its diversified lineup of wholly owned operating subsidiaries which stretch across a broad spectrum of industries—most notably insurance railroads utilities and energy. However as a result of recent changes to GAAP reporting rules the quarterly mark-to-market fluctuations in the value of Berkshire's investment portfolio must be reflected on the company's income statement a rule that Buffett has decried as introducing misleading volatility into the company's reported financial results.

As noted above operating earnings increased from $5.0 billion in Q4 FY 2020 to $7.3 billion in Q4 FY 2022 an improvement of 45.1%. Increases were recorded across four of Berkshire's five major reporting segments. Insurance underwriting swung from a loss of $299 million in Q4 FY 2020 to a profit of $372 million in Q4 2021. Insurance investment income fell from $1.270 billion to $1.219 billion. Railroads utilities and energy rose from $1.995 billion to $2.241 billion. ""Other businesses"" (manufacturing services and retailing) rose from $2.467 billion to $2.791 billion. ""Other"" (which includes goodwill and indefinite-lived asset impairment charges) swung from a loss of $412 million in Q4 2020 to a profit of $662 million in Q4 FY 2021.



Berkshire Hathaway's next earnings report for Q1 FY 2022 is expected to be released on April 30 2022 the date of the company's annual meeting.



Warren Buffett's 2021 Annual Letter

On Feb. 26 2022 Berkshire Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett also released his annual letter to shareholders. Highlights are presented below and italics are as they appear in the letter.

Business Pickers Not Stock Pickers

""Whatever our form of ownership our goal is to have meaningful investments in businesses with both durable economic advantages and a first-class CEO ... we own stocks based upon our expectations about their long-term business performance and not because we view them as vehicles for timely market moves. That point is crucial: Charlie [Munger] and I are not stock-pickers; we are business-pickers.""

'Infrastructure' Colossus

""Many people perceive Berkshire as a large and somewhat strange collection of financial assets. In truth Berkshire owns and operates more U.S.-based ""infrastructure"" assets—classified on our balance sheet as property plant and equipment—than are owned and operated by any other American corporation. That supremacy has never been our goal. It has however become a fact.""

""Berkshire is constructed to handle catastrophic events as no other insurer—and that priority will remain long after Charlie and I are gone.""



Berkshire's 'Four Giants'

""Through Berkshire our shareholders own many dozens of businesses ... Nevertheless operations of our 'Big Four' companies account for a very large chunk of Berkshire's value.""

""The insurance business is made to order for Berkshire. The product will never be obsolete and sales volume will generally increase along with both economic growth and inflation. Also integrity and capital will forever be important. Our company can and will behave well.""



""Apple [Inc. (AAPL)] [is] our runner-up Giant as measured by its yearend market value ... our ownership is a mere 5.55% up from 5.39% a year earlier. That increase sounds like small potatoes. But consider that each 0.1% of Apple's 2021 earnings amounted to $100 million ... only dividends from Apple are counted in the GAAP earnings Berkshire reports—and last year Apple paid us $785 million of those. Yet our 'share' of Apple's earnings amounted to a staggering $5.6 billion.""

Note: As of Dec. 31 2021 Berkshire's stake in Apple had a market value $161.2 billion representing 45.9% of its $350.7 billion equity investment portfolio.

""[Railroad] BNSF our third Giant continues to be the number one artery of American commerce which makes it an indispensable asset for America as well as for Berkshire. If the many essential products BNSF carries were instead hauled by truck America's carbon emissions would soar.""

""BHE [Berkshire Hathaway Energy] our final Giant earned a record $4 billion in 2021. That's up more than 30-fold from the $122 million earned in 2000 the year that Berkshire first purchased a BHE stake. Now Berkshire owns 91.1% of the company.""

Note: For full year 2021 Berkshire's insurance railroad and utilities and energy segments accounted for a combined $15.0 billion of net earnings. Its manufacturing service and retailing segment which contains the rest of its operating subsidiaries accounted for $11.1 billion.

Three Ways to Increase Shareholder Value

""There are three ways that we can increase the value of your investment. The first is always front and center in our minds: Increase the long-term earning power of Berkshire's controlled businesses through internal growth or by making acquisitions. Today internal opportunities deliver far better returns than acquisitions. The size of those opportunities however is small compared to Berkshire's resources.""

""Our second choice is to buy non-controlling part-interests in the many good or great businesses that are publicly traded ... Today though we find little that excites us. That's largely because of a truism: Long-term interest rates that are low push the prices of all productive investments upward whether these are stocks apartments farms oil wells whatever.""

""Our final path to value creation is to repurchase Berkshire shares. Through that simple act we increase your share of the many controlled and non-controlled businesses Berkshire owns. When the price/value equation is right this path is the easiest and most certain way for us to increase your wealth. (Alongside the accretion of value to continuing shareholders a couple of other parties gain: Repurchases are modestly beneficial to the seller of the repurchased shares and to society as well.)""



""Berkshire's buyback opportunities are limited because of its high-class investor base. If our shares were heavily held by short-term speculators both price volatility and transaction volumes would materially increase. That kind of reshaping would offer us far greater opportunities for creating value by making repurchases.""

BBY,Best Buy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vbmV3cy9pLXNob3VsZC1oYXZlLW5ldmVyLWJvdWdodC10aGUtcHM1LWhkLWNhbWVyYS1hbmQtbmVpdGhlci1zaG91bGQteW910gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I should have never bought the PS5 HD Camera – and neither should you,"Hindsight is a wonderful thing but I still don’t know why I bought the PS5 HD Camera. In fact I don’t even have the thing plugged in anymore – a testament to how much I’ve been enjoying my spurious new purchase.

Perhaps I bought it out of mere curiosity or maybe it was because the Shellder-looking device was on sale at the time. Unfortunately apart from using it to stream on Twitch now and then the PS5 HD Camera is woefully limited in what it can do.

I remember questioning why anyone would buy the PS4 Camera when it first launched but it’s currently a far more capable device than Sony’s recent iteration of its proprietary webcam. The PS4 Camera has facial recognition so you can log in to your PS4 hands-free includes a microphone so you can shout out voice commands and eventually became an integral part of PSVR allowing head and gesture tracking.

Not that next-gen

(Image credit: Sony)

The PlayStation 5 HD Camera in comparison doesn’t have a microphone has no facial recognition for seamless logins and won’t even be necessary for PSVR 2 as the new headset has inside-out tracking and dedicated controllers. You can’t even replace the PS4 camera with the PS5 version if you do want to use it for PSVR which says it all really.

You do get significantly better image quality on Sony’s new PS5 camera as the PlayStation 5 version is capable of 1080p capture while the PS4’s version tops out at 800p. However the PS4 camera was at least used in some games like Alien Isolation all of the Just Dance titles and Tearaway Unfolded. No games support the PS5 HD Camera right now.

The regret is real

I know that my buyer’s remorse is entirely my own fault of course – I didn’t have to buy the PS5 HD Camera and it’s not like I didn’t know that it could only be used to broadcast yourself on Twitch or YouTube when I bought it. But still I was hoping there would be some other benefit to owning one. I do admittedly like the built-in stand that lets you place the camera on top of or below your TV and the 80s child in me really appreciates that the camera looks a bit like Short Circuit’s Jonny 5.

But unless you’re fully committed to streaming solely on PS5 which isn’t without its issues the PS5 HD Camera simply isn’t worth your money right now. In the future we could see Sony adding some much-needed functionality – facial recognition would be an easy win for example – but currently it doesn’t do enough to justify the $60 / £50 / AU$99.95 price tag.

Steer clear

(Image credit: Sony)

Frustratingly Sony doesn’t let you use any other webcams on PS5. This is at odds with Microsoft’s approach. You can plug almost any third-party webcam into an Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S for streaming many of which perform better than the PlayStation 5 HD Camera and have the added bonus of working on a PC.

That could make the PS5 HD Camera an unavoidable purchase for some but for everyone else heed my advice and steer clear. You really don’t need it.

However there is one PS5 accessory that I wholeheartedly recommend picking up right now: the DualSense Charging Station. I’ve found that since buying the Charging Station it’s helped alleviate any feelings of frustration I have when the 'Wireless Controller battery is low' prompt appears – something that happens far too frequently.



The DualSense Charging Station doesn't occupy any of the PS5’s precious USB ports either as it plugs directly into a power outlet. This means after you've finished playing you simply pop your pad into the dock and it’ll be ready to go when you return.

Better still if you own a second DualSense controller you can hot-swap between pads when required. As you play on your freshly charged pad your other controller will be charging so you’ll technically never be caught short again when it comes to the DualSense's middling battery life. Unlike the PS5 HD Camera it's totally worth the asking price of $30 / £24.99.

Compact SUVs are the second most popular choice among Canadians after pickups. Competition is extremely fierce and getting to the top is quite an accomplishment.

Winner

For 2022 the Toyota RAV4 repeats as our Best Buy award winner. Offering a spacious interior and a large trunk not to mention a smooth ride it’s the kind of SUV most people are looking for.

Powertrain selection is another big draw. In addition to a conventional gasoline model you have the RAV4 Hybrid and RAV4 Prime plug-in hybrid. The latter can travel up to 68 km in EV mode and output is rated at 302 horsepower. Too bad that customers have to wait two years or more to get one.

Other Finalists

The runner-up this year is the same as last year. The Subaru Forester after all is a safe bet when it comes to compact SUVs.

Photo: Mathieu St-Pierre

The 2022 iteration gets a few cosmetic tweaks and adds a rugged Wilderness model aimed at adventurous drivers. But no matter which Forester you pick you’ll be treated to a comfortable ride along with excellent visibility and decent performance.

As for third place we chose the Nissan Rogue and Mitsubishi Outlander. Sharing the same platform these two models boast adequate room safe handling and good performance.

The Rogue stands out with great value while the Outlander has a best-in-class warranty. The former comes with a choice of two gasoline engines including a new-for-2022 turbocharged triple-cylinder while the latter is available in gas and PHEV variants. Keep in mind however than the 2023 Outlander PHEV will be much improved and capable of longer range.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2VsZGVuLXJpbmctYmVzdC1lYXJseS1pdGVtcy1idXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elden Ring: Best Items To Buy Early,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2VsZGVuLXJpbmctYmVzdC1lYXJseS1pdGVtcy1idXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9yZXZpZXdlZC8yMDIyLzAyLzI3L2Jlc3QtZGVhbHMtdG9kYXktc2hvcC1kZWVwLWRpc2NvdW50cy1mYXNoaW9uLWhvbWUtYW5kLXRlY2gvNjk1MjU0ODAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best deals today: Shop deep discounts on fashion home and tech,"— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors.

Liath in Blackrock Dublin was promoted from One to Two MICHELIN Stars.



Here chef-owner Damien Grey took time during the lockdowns to reflect and come up with something new. The restaurant now has a stylish contemporary look and as you cross the threshold from the rustic market into this cosy room it feels like you've entered into a magical world.



Bold original dishes have been continually reworked and perfect over the years and are centred around the five tastes – salty savoury sweet bitter and sour – which come together in perfect harmony. And with just a handful of tables it gives Damien and his team the chance to explain the dishes and interact with guests on a personal level creating a unique and memorable experience.

Hot Capital is money that moves quickly and mimetically following the latest fad or culture war skirmish. And right now huge sums of money are being mobilized and channeled into projects companies and causes as a result of inflamed rivalrous passions. The rise of this “Hot Capital”—made possible by money that is practically free—has led to the decadent funding of small-minded and small-spirited coups under the guise of grandiosity and it is mortgaging our future. Escaping the destruction cycle will require more than smart monetary policy and a return to reality in markets. It will require the adoption of long-term goals that transcend the logic of war.

Donald Trump’s SPAC the Trump Media and Technology Group with its soon-to-be-released app called “Truth Social” has already attracted enough capital to value it at well over $1 billion—with little to show for itself other than heated rhetoric and a user interface that looks identical to Twitter.

In 2021 Tariq Fancy the former CIO of sustainable investing at BlackRock said that investments based primarily on ESG concerns are “a dangerous placebo that harms the public interest.” Meanwhile morally-panicked investors have funneled more than $1 trillion dollars into products like Green Bonds—debt issued by companies to finance environmentally-friendly causes—which have questionable impact but which also result in higher fees to money management firms like BlackRock.

Meme stocks which made their spectacular entrance onto the global scene with GameStop’s parabolic rise in early 2021 have often been fueled by angry capital—as justified or righteous as that anger might be. In the case of Gamestop (or “Gamestonk” if you prefer) a large amount of money was channeled as a vendetta against perceived injustices of the past. Company fundamentals didn’t matter. Retail investors who felt burned by the Wall Street crash in 2008 got in on the action. (My own temperature rose just watching the battle play out and I was infected with an intense desire to participate—it took everything I had to stay on the sidelines.)

Hot Capital is not just “smart” or “dumb” money. It’s emotional money. This is why every good donor-driven marketing video in the world attempts to pull at people’s heart strings. But now the same kind of energy and anger that fuels most modern political campaigns is spreading to every other domain. And it’s affecting the way that capital is raised and how it changes hands.

A hot-enough take can attract large amounts of capital practically overnight. We’re living in the Hot Takeconomy and Hot Capital is its currency.

Robin DiAngelo who published her book White Fragility in June 2018 saw it practically become required reading during the George Floyd protests in the summer of 2020. She instantly attracted hundreds of thousands of dollars in Hot Capital from companies that wanted to hear her speak. It was the fear-driven form of Hot Capital. Had DiAngelo wanted to start a company (any company!) with a mission to combat racism I imagine the venture capital arm of Tiger Global would’ve been knocking at her door with a Hot Capital check within hours.

Something has changed. A dark force is at work in the world. It’s the same force that has always allowed savvy politicians to quickly raise more money than ever before.

Now it’s leading to the creation of new (“free speech” anti-woke) social media platforms and ritual social justice fundraisers. It now takes mere minutes for somebody to erect a GoFundMe page after something incendiary hits the news cycle. Start-ups actively tailor their fundraising pitches to battle-ready investors. Maybe you were lucky enough not to witness the web3 meme-war that went down on Twitter and which showed just how thin-skinned the holders and deployers of this capital currently are.

Hot Capital is the financialization of the fight-or-flight response. It’s reactionary. Those who complain the most about Woke Capital for example are just as likely to use their crusade against Woke Capital to raise Hot Capital of their own—to draw attention to say anti-anti-racism work or form the core of a political platform or start the University of Austin).

Hot Capital flows to the loudest voices at a given moment. This capital is not priced to reflect the value that those voices and their companies and projects can create; its price is a reflection of the giver’s desire to win a mimetic game—and that is always an inefficient way to allocate capital. It hinders economic growth as it fuels ideological warfare and distracts us from building lasting works or addressing genuine structural problems.

We’d all be better off if this capital were channeled toward things that actually matter—things which contribute to the building up of a sustainable integral human ecology. But that depends on breaking the mimetic cycle fueled by Hot Capital.

That won’t be easy. The quickest way to accumulate a lot of donations in today’s nonprofit sector for example is to create a threat and then ratchet up the fear mongering about this threat in order to raise a war chest. BLM does this to great effect on the Left. Christopher Rufo has employed similar tactics on the Right to spearhead a campaign against teaching Critical Race Theory in public schools memeing his way into relevance and capital-raising. Everyone is playing the same game.

This would come as old news to René Girard a French-born professor of literature and history who began articulating his insights about desire and conflict in the late 1950s. Girard recognized that people want what others want—mimetic desire—and come into conflict with each other not because they or their desires are different but because they’re fundamentally the same: in the case of the political Left and Right that seems to be power. Or as Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff have put it: “the right's monomania and the left's Great Awokening feed each other.”

According to Girard mimetic desire breeds rivalries which in turn breeds never-ending conflict—an unfortunate state of affairs that I caution against in my book Wanting: The Power of Mimetic Desire in Everyday Life. Girard believed that there was a way out of this spiral of conflict though. It starts with a clear-eyed recognition and then a renunciation: seeing that what we’ve been fighting over is self-destructive and that we have more to gain by renouncing our fixation with our rival than by embarking on the infinite game of trying to defeat him.

Hot Capital exacerbates the very problem Girard identified. It achieves exit velocity by superheating mimetic rivalries—often intentionally. The power players marshaling this capital aren’t using it to construct Mont Saint Michel Abbeys or Chartres Cathedrals. Instead they’re gathering it to differentiate themselves in the marketplace of ideas and using it to build more weapons for a final showdown. Give this money to us goes their Hot Capital sales pitch and we’ll put a stop to them because we want the opposite of what they want. (Don’t you?)

In a mimetic rivalry objects take on value because the rival wants them. They want CRT in the schools? So be it; we’ll stop CRT by force of political will if we have to and we need the donations of allies and comrades like you to do it. Every victory is ultimately Pyrrhic though. By defeating your enemy you paradoxically defeat your own reason for being. And that’s why the cavalier deployment of Hot Capital is not just wasteful. It’s idiotic.

René Girard understood this tendency too. “Modern individualism assumes the form of a desperate denial of the fact that through mimetic desire each of us seeks to impose his will upon his fellow man whom he professes to love but more often despises” he said. As I read this quote now I understand “impose his will” as having turned into “impose his will by pouring capital into initiatives that lead to ever-greater amounts of censorship and unfreedom for our enemy.”

How high will temperatures rise? It’s hard to say. Right now Hot Capital is polarizing the world. Each side is rushing to build its own communications networks infrastructure even universities. The economy is fragmenting into red and blue companies and corresponding capital streams—but the common denominator is that they’re Hot.

“Mainstreaming your differentiators” is a buzzy catchphrase in the marketing trade and Hot Capital achieves market segmentation and demographic hyper-targeting as easily as a bug lamp attracts flies. Even peripheral players in the Hot Capital game such as the red-coded Black Rifle Coffee Company and the blue-coded Impossible Foods help drive always-already polarized consumers into the appropriate camps. A libertarian-leaning supplement company founder—now a convicted felon—recently juiced sales of camouflage-branded sports supplements merely by pulling his company’s sponsorship from Arnold Schwarzenegger’s fitness events due to the “Governator’s” stance on vaccine and mask mandates. In this sense Hot Capital is sales and marketing on “God Mode” with every cheat code enabled.

But the mimetic rivalries ginned up by Hot Capital are also incredibly toxic–and many times more viral than even the most contagious instance of a coronavirus. In Wanting I write about the importance of shielding ourselves from this infection and learning to desire a future that isn’t mediated to us by our rivals: one outside of the cycle. Given the stakes of the social conflict that Hot Capital fuels this is critically important. We would be wise to renounce our roles in these rivalries. Mimetic rivalries are always ultimately destructive and make fools of even their most ardent and heroic crusaders.

Cooler heads will discover the rational alternative to Hot Capital. In the process of heating up these rivalrous mimetic desires Hot Capital doesn’t temper them like steel–it makes them thin and frangible revealing precisely how superficial they are. They have no staying power.

If we recognize this the rise of Hot Capital can serve not as the cause of our undoing but rather as an event that reveals the place where we need to dig to find something truly valuable. For example: the fight over CRT in schools is one place Hot Capital is flowing to right now—but what might that lead us to see about the deeper structural issues with education? About the role of parents and the family? About the way we talk about racism? When Hot Capital fixates attention on a single Archimedean point (however illusory it may be) valuable opportunities are lost elsewhere.

So as Hot Capital is funneled to the Hot Heads with the Hottest Takes let’s consider the value of Cold Measured Capital deployed by those who stand at least somewhat outside of the mimetic crisis—those with the ability to look with sober eyes at the things that will contribute the most to the common good over the next 10 or 20 or 50 years. These are the “thick desires” that will endure long past the time when Hot Capital has cooled and its idols have been forgotten.

These thick desires are less contagious less accessible and at times obscured by noise—but they are nevertheless protected from the volatility of changing circumstances in our lives and in the political climate. They are worth investing in.

One need not be an investor to begin doing this. It starts by developing an anti-mimetic disposition—a “critical distance”—from the mimetic flow of capital. This creates investment opportunities of time attention and long-term commitment.

Hot Capital merely scorches the earth turning the world into an impoverished desert for civil discourse and human flourishing and calling it “good actually.” Winning these tiny mimetic games is precisely how we all lose—because when you play stupid games you win stupid prizes.

There are important investments that each one of us can make today and it doesn’t depend on what the Hot Capitalists are doing. Let them burn.

In Killeedy GAA grounds it finished Blackrock 0-9 Scariff 2-11.

The east Clare side now play in the provincial final on March 12 bidding to become the first Banner side to win the Michael Fitzmaurice Cup title.

Scariff could have won by more but for a tally of 12 wides - 10 more than the men from Kilfinane-Ardpatrick.

Backed by the very strong breeze Scariff laid the foundation for victory in the opening half when leading 1-7 to 0-3 at half time.

The eventual winners were eight points clear after 11-minutes and this would be the winning margin at the final whistle.

Scariff had a goal in either half from Cian Foley.

Blackrock had just three scores into the breeze in the first half - all frees in the second quarter from Gavin O'Loughlin Barry O'Shaughessy and James O'Doherty.

In the second half The Rockies had a good start with O'Shaughnessy (free) and Donnacha Leahy points.

O'Loughlin went close to a goal after 13-minutes but William Kavanagh made a fine save in the Scariff goals.

O'Shaughnessy and O'Doherty (free) scores left it 1-10 to 0-7 with 10-minutes to play.

Blackrock needed a goal but the green flag went the way of Scariff when Foley added his second seven minutes from time.

Leahy and Niall Moloney had Blackrock points in the closing minutes but there was no denying Scariff victory.

SCORERS: Scariff: Cian Foley 2-1 Eanna O'Brien 0-4 Ronan Corry Tadgh Kavanagh Jim Minogue Martin Walsh Sean Cunningham and Josh Moloney 0-1 each. Blackrock: Barry O'Shaughnessy 0-3 (2frees) James O'Doherty (2frees) and Donnacha Leahy 0-2 each Gavin O'Loughlin (free) and Niall Moloney 0-1 each.

Cronin And Byrne Delighted That Railway’s ‘Hard Work Paid Off’

Eve Higgins delivered an Energia player-of-the-match performance and her Ireland colleague Ailsa Hughes snapped up a brace of tries as the Sandymount club won just their second ever league crown.

A breathless first half finished 14-8 in Railway’s favour Molly Scuffil-McCabe and Hughes both touching down with Blackrock’s Hannah O’Connor replying off the back of a scrum.

The defending champions coped well during Katie Heffernan’s sin-binning Nikki Caughey clipping over a penalty in response to two Meabh Deely kicks.

Into the final quarter Hughes and Emma Hooban traded tries – Deely added an excellent conversion to restore the six-point gap – but Railway stood firm despite a yellow card for tighthead Katie O’Dwyer.

The pace was a mile-a-minute early on these south Dublin rivals hurtling into tackles and giving precious little space to out-halves Caughey and Jackie Shiels in particular.

The breakthrough came in the 14th minute centre Higgins’ classy break from halfway taking her outside Shiels and her pass inside found the trailing Scuffil-McCabe for a crisp finish to the left of the posts.

The conversion from Caughey made it a seven-pointer but Blackrock in their first AIL final since 2014 fired back quickly Maeve Liston’s determined run taking her up into the Railway 22.

From a scrum on the right number 8 O’Connor grasped her opportunity to break from the base evade Emma Murphy and break Caughey’s tackle to give Blackrock the ideal response.

Deely was unable to convert and John Cronin’s well-drilled Railway outfit began the second quarter with another converted score scrum half Hughes catching ‘Rock napping at a ruck with a terrific burst to the line.

Solid defence from Natasja Behan foiled a Niamh Byrne break winning a clearing penalty in the process and further improvements at the breakdown from Dorothy Wall and Katie Fitzhenry earned a kickable penalty for ‘Rock.

A very well-struck 33rd-minute effort from Deely closed the gap to 14-8 but ‘Rock could not profit from Heffernan’s yellow before half-time as Caughey covered a kick through past her own posts.

It was a case of mistaken identity for referee Dan Carson as he binned Heffernan rather than Railway captain Byrne who had been guilty of catching Behan with a high tackle.

Deely and Caughey exchanged penalties on the resumption with the Railway scrum delivering the goods at set-piece time. Caughey was short with a subsequent kick as their lead remained at six points.

It looked like a killer blow had been struck in the 63rd minute Caughey sending Heffernan through the middle and she deftly combined with young replacement Amanda McQuade to send Hughes in behind the posts. Caughey’s conversion made it 24-11.

However the Blackrock forwards redoubled their efforts their strong lineout mauling drawing a yellow card for O’Dwyer before the resulting drive ended with hooker Hooban plunging over for their second try.

Ballinasloe youngster Deely coolly converted from the left making it a six-point game again. Suddenly ‘Rock were reenergised Wall striding into Railway territory and their maul carrying an increasing threat.

Crucially Ben Martin’s charges were penalised for sealing off just a few metres out allowing Railway to claw back territory. Replacement Anna McGann made a telling break and Railway’s experience of the 2019 final helped them to close out title number two.

EACH SUCCESS IS built from a thousand discrete events.

Liverpool last won the League Cup 10 years ago a few months after the game that will have played an integral role if there’s another victory this weekend.

The result of that game?

Ballincollig U14s 8-1 Ringmahon Rangers U14s

Robbie O’Leary was the chastened goalkeeper for Ringmahon: he was still U13 but playing a level up for a team coached by his Dad. So chastened in fact that he decided he had enough.

“It was a bad loss” he tells The42. “I was getting a lot of stick off the boys and I was like ‘Fuck this.’ I quit that team and just played at my own age. Looking back now it was nothing major; there was nothing malicious about it. It was just me being a little baby basically.”

That left Ringmahon in need of a goalkeeper so Ray Kelleher rang coach Eddie Harrington to say they should try out his son in goal. The ramifications of that phonecall will be on show at Wembley on Sunday afternoon.

“They got Caoimhín and look what happened then!” laughs Robbie.

Robbie’s decision to quit cleared a path for Caoimhín Kelleher to first become a goalkeeper. To that point he had been Ringmahon’s main striker.

“He was a quality striker” says Robbie. “I wouldn’t say he would definitely played for Liverpool as a striker but definitely would have at a slightly lower level.”

Kelleher was a regular goalscorer for Ringmahon and the Cork league’s representative team who occasionally asked him to go in goal amid murmurings of his talent in that department. Given he wasn’t playing in goal for Ringmahon Kelleher resisted the calls.

There was an initial reluctance at Ringmahon to move Kelleher too as Robbie’s father explained to The42 in 2019.

“When he was playing outfield we all thought he’d make it as a professional striker he was that good. When he went in goal the first time I was shocked. I was saying ‘What in the name of God is he going in goal for?’ because he was so good outfield.”

Thus it came to pass: Kelleher was lobbed from distance for a 1-0 defeat in his first game but he impressed nonetheless.

Robbie played for the age-group below but continued to train with the U14s. He was happy simply to train because it was instantly clear he wouldn’t be getting his spot back. “As soon as you watched him in a game you could see how good he was. Ah the man was gifted. You can see him with the ball at his feet he was like a striker.

“A bit like Ederson at Man City he’s quality with the ball at his feet. That’s what Caoimhín was like at schoolboys you couldn’t touch him. And in training you just couldn’t score on him. Nobody could.

“I have never seen a goalkeeper our age that good with the ball at his feet. It comes from being an unbelievable striker.”

Kelleher spoke admiringly of Manuel Neuer when he was first introduced to the Irish press as an underage international and given his position he didn’t have much cause to pay close attention to goalkeepers of an earlier vintage.

If his pedigree as an outfield player is evident when this ball at his feet his character is seen in everything he does.

Roy Keane praised Kelleher’s temperment when he was first called up to the senior international squad in 2018 while Liverpool goalkeeper coach John Achterberg recently told The Athletic that Kelleher “is doing really well unbelievable speed and reactions but he’s also calm”.

“He is very very quiet. You can’t get him excited” says Robbie. “My Dad loves him everyone loves him. He’s just so quiet. A cool fella. Everyone likes Caoimhín you can’t not like him. He doesn’t do anything wrong to anyone.

“That comes from his Mam and Dad and how he was raised.”

Caoimhín is one of six siblings most of whom have made their mark in a sporting sense. Fiacre Kelleher is also a professional footballer – currently at Bradford City having been at Celtic – while Tim is a scratch golfer and Olan has won hurling medals with Blackrock.

Their father Ray tragically passed away in 2014.

“I’ll never forget his Dad’s removal I have never seen a crowd like it anywhere” remembers Robbie. “There were a thousand people backed up there to pay their respects to the family. They are a very well-known and very nice family.”

Kelleher’s performances for Ringmahon quickly garnered interest with Manchester United Arsenal Blackburn and Aston Villa all interested. Ultimately he signed for Liverpool having initially gone on trial. 48 hours into said trial he was tossed into the deep end of an U18s game with Derby County.

“He came in on the Friday I took him out in the afternoon and did 30 to 40 minutes just to settle him down then he played the game. We wanted to sign him straight away” said U18s goalkeeper coach Neil Edwards. “The rest is history as they say.”

Kelleher took the time to leave Ringmahon on a majestic note.

Needing a draw against College Corinthians in the final game of the season to win the league Ringmahon trailed 1-0 going into injury time. Kelleher went forward for a last-gasp corner from which a team-mate bundled in a glorious equaliser.

And thus he left for Liverpool and climbed the ranks. The rivalry that has come to define his international career first cropped up at Liverpool: Achterberg did his due diligence by joining the scores descending on Tallaght to scout a 16-year-old called Gavin Bazunu but decided Liverpool were better off sticking by Kelleher.

Stephen Kenny may envy the fact Liverpool have only had to make the choice once.

Kelleher sprang through the age-groups at Liverpool – U18s to U23s – and found himself on the fringes of the first team by the 2018/19 season nudging his way into third-choice behind Alisson and Simon Mignolet.

He sat on the bench for an FA Cup tie with Wolves and most gloriously the Champions League final against Tottenham in Madrid. That season was preceded by a pre-season friendly against Napoli at the Aviva Stadium after which Jurgen Klopp enthused that Kelleher was an ”outstanding talent”.

The following season brought his debut against MK Dons in the League Cup in which he became the first Irish player to appear in a competitive first-team game for Liverpool since Robbie Keane appeared in a 1-1 draw with Wigan Athletic on 28 January 2009 almost 4000 days earlier. An appearance in a bonkers 5-5 draw with Arsenal in the following round followed through which Liverpool scraped on penalties. An onlooking Virgil van Dijk tweeted his approval.

Man like pic.twitter.com/MLrbgjfY2K — Virgil van Dijk (@VirgilvDijk) October 30 2019

Debuts in the Champions League and Premier League followed last season and Kelleher kept clean sheets in both.

“Nothing fazes him” says Robbie. “He plays against Ajax and gets man of the match like. It doesn’t surprise me.” He made his senior international debut at the end of last season playing the second half without conceding in a hostile atmosphere away to Hungary.

That debut might have come much earlier has it not been for bad luck: starting 2021 as second-choice to Darren Randolph Kelleher was in line to start Ireland’s World Cup qualification campaign away to Serbia until he too was stymied by injury. Bazunu then forced his way in after Mark Travers’ struggles in Belgrade and has been undroppable since.

For as long as Bazunu is playing this regularly and this well Kelleher may ultimately have to seek first-team football to become first-choice for his country. For now Liverpool are thrilled with the quality of their understudy.

“At some point in the future there could be a time when Caoimhín might decide he wants to be a No 1″ said Achterbeg. “I have no doubt about his ability to achieve that.”

Hence why Kelleher will play Sunday’s final against Chelsea: Liverpool want to keep him.

“Caoimhín will play if he is fit” said Jurgen Klopp. “As a football manager you have to consider a lot of things and one of the things is we consider Caoimhín an outstanding goalie. Not a good goalie an outstanding goalie and we want to keep him here. And to keep him you need to make sure of a few things.”

Liverpool are now making sure of things with a goalkeeper who was once anything but a sure thing. Robbie is a Manchester United fan but does he ever sit back and think of how he did Liverpool an enormous favour?

“It is true. I’m not saying he would never have gone in goal but he wouldn’t have done so in that season and that’s when he took off. He wouldn’t have gone in goal that year but he might have gone in goal in a future year.”

Robbie by the way is still playing in goal for Ringmahon now at Junior level. Will Kelleher’s involvement make him yield slightly toward Liverpool in spite of his United allegiances?

“I don’t want Liverpool to win I don’t. But I hope Caoimhín has an unbelievable game. Like I hope it goes to penalties and Caoimhín saves four but Chelsea score one.

“He is a great fella and hopefully his career goes on and on.”"

You want to watch this. On Netflix.

I’ve had a fascination with aircraft ever since my first jet flight on a Boeing 720B. We all knew the 707 it substituted for “jet” the same way “Kleenex” substitutes for “tissue.” Hell ultimately Steve Miller sang a song about it. So what was a 720B?

I started to pay attention to the jets at the airport. The 727 was the one with the three engines at the back with the high tailfeather. The DC-9 was similar but smaller with only two engines. The DC-10 was like a giant 727 and it had a spotty safety record. You started to worry about flying on a DC-10 towards the end of its service.

And then came Airbus. AirBUS? It’s not a bus but a plane! And there’s no way the Europeans could compete with Boeing NO WAY!

Only that proved to be untrue. Just like our ability to win in Vietnam. Boomers were brought up in an age where the United States was the undisputed king we thought there was nothing our country couldn’t achieve in truth all the boomers were active patriots waving the flag until the mid-sixties and Vietnam when they might be sent to Southeast Asia and get their ass shot off in an unwinnable war.

That was the human element.

And that’s what “Downfall” adds to the picture. I knew almost everything in the flick having followed the story closely but to see the relatives of the dead? You never recover from that. And I can’t think of a worse way to die than in an airplane. Come on to this day when something odd happens on the jet you start to contemplate it especially when the captain comes on and says there’s a problem. I’ve been there I don’t think my anxiety has ever been higher than the return flight to the airport we’d taken off from.

But in truth your odds of dying in the crash of a major airline jet are infinitesimal your odds of dying in a car are higher. But when it happens essentially no one survives. I mean dying in an avalanche is bad but in a matter of minutes you pass out. The plane heading straight down to the land or sea…I don’t even want to contemplate it.

So there are two stories involved here. The one of the two crashes the Lion and Ethiopian 737 Maxes and the corporate greed that ultimately caused the problem.

You see Boeing was beaten to the punch by Airbus. Boeing was disrupted. By technology. Airbus provided a much more fuel efficient airplane and Boeing had nothing to compete with it to create a brand new competitor would take nearly a decade. So Boeing gussied up the decades old 737 and sold it as a solution.

But you can’t continually fix the past oftentimes you have to start with a blank sheet of paper. Techies are normally good with this. Write off the past for a better future. Which is why I’m against the EU standardizing USB-C as the world’s connector. You want to impede technological innovation? Hell the Lightning connector in today’s iPhones is far superior to the 30 pin one offered on the original devices and smaller too.

But it’s the emphasis on corporate greed that ultimately resonates here.

Boeing moved its headquarters to Chicago. That would be like Universal Music doing the same it made no sense the planes were built in Seattle and the South Carolina.

But what this documentary does so well is delineate the schism that ultimately led to the crashes. Boeing merged with the fading McDonnell Douglas which itself was the result of a merger and ultimately the McDonnell Douglas brass ended up in control. And they had no understanding of the Boeing corporate culture and only cared about profits. They wanted to make their bonuses!

And that’s America in a nutshell. Why is it that a corporation’s only duty is to deliver shareholder wealth? I don’t see that in the Bible.

And forget the 737 Max if you follow the sphere you know there are problems with the 787 Dreamliner. I’ll make it simple they’re built shoddily and therefore they keep on getting recalled and grounded. Build it once right the foundation is key. But the foundation went out the window when CEOs could suddenly end up billionaires solely from their compensation at the company.

I mean how do you remove metal filings from the wiring?

In truth all new planes need modifications. Which is why savvy customers never bought a car in the year of its introduction nor a new tech product. But then Toyota always got it right and so did the tech companies the products worked right out of the box and you expected that. So you expected the 737 Max to not be rotten at its core. But it was.

And it all came down to efficiency. If they told the airlines and the FAA the plane was significantly different from the original 737 pilots would need simulator training and that’s very costly.

But it turned out the pilots ended up needing to be trained anyway. Never mind the planes sitting on the tarmac for all those months waiting for a software update.

Yes welcome to the modern world where software is king. For those of us conscious before the twenty first century this is hard to fathom. The hardware was king. And if you were savvy you might be able to fix it yourself. Now you can’t fix your own car. Then again they break down a lot less. And when there’s a problem Tesla just sends an update over the air via the internet and it’s solved. Meanwhile Detroit is trying to meld the old with the new and so far it hasn’t worked well. It’s kind of like Apple building the computer is the easiest part it can be done in factories by low-paid employees in China. But there’s no way in hell those workers can write the software that makes them work.

So this story is continuing not only at Boeing but Airbus too Qatar Airways is complaining that its A350s are defective with the paint peeling. Then again Airbus admits the flaws no one other than the Qatar government believes there’s a safety problem and in truth it’s just about money.

So you see the thousands of people building Boeing planes. And you can’t help but see the discrepancy in pay between them and those in the C-Suite. Now we see income inequality everywhere we go. And like in the Amazon warehouses Boeing workers had goals they had to hit no matter what and what was sacrificed was safety.

But you’ll learn all that in “Downfall.” Which is not a big commitment only an hour and a half. And it holds your interest throughout.

And in truth the buzz is building this one film is going to dent Boeing in a way years of news stories has not. But the reason I watched the film was the personal recommendations from my readers. The rest of the hype just flew right by me.

It shouldn’t fly right by you.

Watch this.

The last of Ethel and Robert F. Kennedy’s eleven children Rory was born seven months after her father’s assassination. The Kennedys are a special breed our American royal family in many ways raised in wealth and privilege close to power but with a great civic pride and mission.

Kennedy looked closely at her family when she made HBO’s Oscar-shortlisted “Ethel” dug into the world of chess in HBO’s “Bobby Fischer Against the World” and won a Primetime Emmy for “Ghosts of Abu Ghraib.” Her latest film “Downfall: The Case Against Boeing” came out of Kennedy’s primal fear of flying. That was one reason why she closely tracked the unfolding news story of two back-to-back airplane crashes that took the lives of a total 346 passengers. On October 29 2018 the sky was clear at Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta International Airport as Lion Air Flight 610 took off and then 13 minutes later fell from the sky. Pilot error was the suspected cause — until five months later when another brand-new Boeing 737 MAX Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 met the same fate.

Kennedy wanted to find out what happened. She pitched the project to Netflix; “Downfall: The Case Against Boeing” premiered at Sundance 2022 to upbeat reviews and is now available to stream. I interviewed Kennedy on Zoom; our conversation is lightly edited for clarity.

Anne Thompson: You have your pick of non-fiction projects. Why chase this one?

Rory Kennedy: This was a project that I wanted to make. I was following the story of the first plane crash and the tragedy there. And when the second plane crashed the same aircraft within five months of each other in eerily similar circumstances it was striking to me. I wanted to understand what happened and who knew what when. In part I didn’t want it to happen again. I was concerned that there was more going on than we were hearing in initial coverage which was focused on pilot error. This film is a story that rises above the facts of what happened. There are lessons to be learned not just about airline safety but the balance of corporate interest and the public interest.

Your film raises questions about other similar examples we don’t know about.

Rory Kennedy: You really see how corporations get pulled into the focus on profits above everything else including the public interest. It’s a story we can all relate to because pretty much all of us fly. We are all invested in the protective elements working. When you walk down that jetway you think: the airline is invested in protecting me the manufacturer is the regulators the FAA is going to do their job Congress is going to make sure this is working properly. And we all trust that. None of that happened in this circumstance. It’s important for all of us to question these things to not assume or take it for granted.

Were you on a mission to reach people with an accessible story?

Rory Kennedy: It was a tricky film to make and a hard story to tell in part because of the technical aspects that people need to understand in order to fully comprehend the decisions that Boeing made along the way that were ultimately responsible for these airplane crashes. We tell the story as it played itself out in the first act: the information that we’re getting on the surface what’s going on with the first airplane crash and the second crash. We then go back and tell the history of Boeing which is deserving of this extraordinary company that’s done amazing things and focused on excellence and quality for so many decades. They got us out of the Depression to the Moon and into international travel. And in the third act once you know the context of what was happening we go back and find out what Boeing knew when during the course of those events. When they sent the second plane up in the air they already had the report that this airplane was likely to crash 15 times over course of its lifetime.

Boeing was willing to risk people dying. They were banking that they could make the fixes before a second crash took place.

Rory Kennedy: That’s exactly right. You had to understand the crashes and what Boeing was saying go back and show what they actually knew back in 2016. If pilots didn’t respond within 10 seconds these planes couldn’t recover. As far back as 2013 they were hiding the existence of the MCAS [software] system to the regulators. And then you understand the implications and you’re also connecting with Michael Stumo whose daughter was on the second plane: “You let me put my daughter on this plane while knowing all of this?”

One of the issues is the plane is retrofitted built wrong. The correction should have been to rebuild the engine. It was built during a time when the company had a top-down management style based on concealment not receptive to concerns about safety. The interactive nature of the cockpit of the plane is not up to current day standards. The alert systems and how they communicate with pilots are not on par with other planes built today. Another ongoing concern when there are problems and the pilots have 10 seconds to respond is to keep in mind the cacophony of alerts coming at them: the stick shaker is shaking and making loud clacker sounds along with the master alarm and the altitude disagree and speed disagree. They have to orient themselves in all of that and figure out the exact right thing to do. Many of those alerts are still happening.

Explain how the pilots were flying blind into certain danger.

Rory Kennedy: The horror of it is that Boeing didn’t want to tell the pilots about the MCAS system or make the FAA aware of it. If they were aware of it then it would require pilot training which costs money and takes them off flying planes. The costs associated with that was about $1 million a plane. Every decision goes back to saving money and so it’s an unfortunate but sad tragic story. It’s sad we have to learn this lesson with 346 people dead. These people who died were amazing. It was a loss for all of us tragic.

You used the the bereaved parents to good effect. How did you pick your cast of characters?

Rory Kennedy: I wanted the film to come from the perspective of people who were on the front lines of this story. It was a combination of the people who worked at Boeing reporters who were chasing down the story like Andy Pastor who was responsible for the revelatory moments and Peter DeFazio the peerless leader of the Transportation Infrastructure Committee who led the biggest investigation in that committee’s history to get to the bottom of what happened. And Michael Stumo whose daughter died in the second crash evolved from victim to advocate. So many of these families organized together to have a voice and stood up to Boeing and continue to do so today.

Boeing had to pay a $2.5 billion penalty in the year they earned $76 billion in sales.

Rory Kennedy: The other of the many tragedies and unfairnesses of this story is that none of the Boeing management have been held responsible for 346 deaths. [Dennis A.] Muilenburg who ran the company at the time left with $62 million they gave him. A lot of these families continue to have concerns about the safety of the 737 MAX being up in the air now. DeFazio says it was a slap on the wrist. From the perspective of the families and other people who follow the story none of the Boeing management faced prison time. Many feel they got away with murder.

The 737 MAX was grounded worldwide between March 2019 and November 2020; the retrofitted version is back in the sky with new training for pilots. Is it safe?

Rory Kennedy: I wouldn’t get on a 737 MAX today; other people would. Personally I wouldn’t due to ongoing concerns about its safety.

Why did you want this film to show on Netflix?

Rory Kennedy: It was a good fit for Netflix: it’s an international story obviously Boeing is an American company but two crashes one was in Africa one in Asia. People all over the world are on these airplanes. How the U.S. reacted to the airplanes the leadership and lack thereof is of great interest to people around the world. The United States is still a beacon of hope and aspiration. It helps all of us to have a correction to hold all of our institutions and systems accountable to make sure we are focusing on the communal interest — not just the individual and financial.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL3Jldmlld3MvcWF0YXItYWlyd2F5cy1idXNpbmVzcy1jbGFzcy03ODctOS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: Qatar Airways Business Class Boeing 787-9 (MXP-DOH),"We had quite a long journey to Oman as we flew Iberia’s A330 business class from Miami to Madrid and then Iberia’s A320neo business class from Madrid to Milan. Next up was the flight I was most looking forward to — Qatar Airways’ new 787-9 business class from Milan to Doha.

How I booked our Qatar Airways business class tickets

Our time in Oman would be starting in Salalah so I booked the following in business class for 42500 AAdvantage miles plus $74.60 in taxes and fees per person:

02/16 IB3252 Madrid to Milan departing departing 11:30AM arriving 1:45PM

02/16 QR128 Milan to Doha departing 3:50PM arriving 11:35PM

02/17 QR1130 Doha to Salalah departing 12:50AM arriving 4:20AM

The reason for the indirect routing (rather than flying direct from Madrid to Doha) is because Milan to Doha was operated by Qatar Airways’ new Boeing 787-9 while Madrid to Doha wasn’t.

Qatar Airways business class boarding

Our flight from Milan to Doha was scheduled to board at 3:05PM 45 minutes before departure. The flight was departing from gate B55 just a short walk from the Sala Montale Lounge.

Qatar Airways boarding gate Milan Malpensa Airport

Business class passengers were invited to board first and boarding took place exclusively through the second set of doors. There I was greeted by the friendly crew and pointed left into business class.

Qatar Airways Boeing 787-9 business class cabin & seats

Qatar Airways has installed all new business class seats on its Boeing 787-9s different than the Qsuites you’ll find on other planes which are among my favorite business class seats in the world. Qatar Airways has a gorgeous entryway by the second set of doors with an area that could be used as a self-serve bar along with a bulkhead that had a cool texture and the carrier’s logo.

Qatar Airways Boeing 787-9 entryway

Qatar Airways’ Boeing 787-9s have a total of 30 business class seats spread across eight rows in a 1-2-1 configuration. Qatar Airways is the launch customer for the new Adient Ascent seat which is a highly customizable product that we’ll soon see on other airlines as well. The cabin is incredibly sleek-looking if you ask me. I’m not usually a fan of burgundy as a color but Qatar Airways pulls it off.

Qatar Airways has a consistent configuration in each row on the 787-9 which is to say that seats aren’t staggered. Along the windows you’ll find reverse herringbone seats facing the windows. Each seat has a door so I’d say the most comparable product would be British Airways’ new Club Suites (though I think Qatar Airways’ product is better).

Qatar Airways business class seat Boeing 787-9

The attention to detail with the seat design is impressive both in terms of style and substance.

While the window seats are in a reverse herringbone configuration the center seats are in a herringbone configuration which is to say that they face the aisle and are angled away from one another. I decided to assign us the two center seats in row five. This mixed reverse herringbone and herringbone layout reminds me of Virgin Atlantic’s new Upper Class.

There’s a very high privacy divider so if you’re seated in a center seat next to a stranger the good news is that you’ll still have full privacy.

If you’re traveling with someone the partition can be lowered the entire way and that’s done by both passengers pushing the down button by the divider at the same time.

Each business class suite has a door which is a nice feature. While the door was pretty easy to open and close it didn’t quite close all the way unlike in Qsuites.

Qatar Airways business class door Boeing 787-9

The area next to the seat was designed both beautifully and functionally. There was a small storage compartment where headphones could be stored and it also had a small mirror.

Next to that was a wireless phone charger. It’s smart that this is vertical and that you can secure your phone in it so that it won’t move around. While wireless charging is a cute concept the catch is that the charging is way slower than if you plug in so it took several hours to get my phone charged.

“Dad bring me home a doggy bag but not that vegan stuff I want the meats!”

The seat controls were located underneath the armrest and were easy to use. There was also a “do not disturb” button.

Above that was the entertainment controller power outlets (AC and 110v) and the headphone jack (though the 787-9 also offers bluetooth audio so that you can use your own headphones which is awesome).

The tray table could be extended from underneath the personal television and was sturdy and large.

One major concern about these types of seats is the size of the footwell as often they’re quite restrictive especially if you have big feet. I found the footwell here to be a good size better than many other popular seats.

Qatar Airways business class footwell Boeing 787-9

There was a literature pocket to the side of the entertainment screen.

The one downside to this seat is the lack of storage. In addition to the small compartment to the side of the seat there’s also a small exposed cubby underneath the seat and to the side.

Each seat also had an individual air nozzle though in the center section these can be quite difficult to reach.

Boy did I miss Qatar Airways! While most airlines have greatly cut back service during the pandemic it was nice to be back on an airline that still offers a great product (even if it’s a bit scaled back compared to pre-coronavirus). Waiting at each seat upon boarding were two pillows and a blanket. I find Qatar Airways’ bedding to be excellent (even if the quotes on the pillows are sometimes a bit “Live Laugh Love” vibes).

Also waiting at each seat were a pair of noise canceling headphones which are reasonably good though not industry-leading.

The menu and wine list were also at my seat upon boarding in the literature pocket.

A moment after settling in the friendly flight attendant working my aisle introduced herself familiarized me with the business class suite and offered me a pre-departure drink. I asked for a glass of champagne (Charles Heidsieck was being served) and the signature lime-mint juice. This was served with a packaged cold towel. Yum!

I was also offered a BRIC’S amenity kit with eyeshades socks earplugs cream facial spray and lip balm.

There was also a protective kit featuring a mask gloves and four packets of hand sanitizer.

Throughout boarding I enjoyed listening to Qatar Airways’ boarding music which is incredibly elegant and calming.

Qatar Airways departure from Milan

By 3:35PM boarding was complete with 20 of the 30 business class seats occupied. At that point the captain made his welcome aboard announcement informing us of our flight time of 5hr10min and our cruising altitude of 39000 feet.

It’s always amazing when you put into perspective the product that Qatar Airways offers compared to what you’ll find on flights of similar length in the United States.

At 3:45PM the main cabin door closed and five minutes later we began our pushback. At that point the safety video was screened. We had a roughly 15 minute taxi to our departure runway — at 4:05PM we were airborne from runway 35R. The Qatar Airways Boeing 787-9 has a nose camera and I loved being able to watch the takeoff view (though it doesn’t quite compare to the A380 tail camera found on some airlines).

Qatar Airways business class entertainment & Wi-Fi

After takeoff I browsed Qatar Airways’ Oryx One entertainment selection which is exceptional.

Qatar Airways Oryx One entertainment system

The system is well organized and has a massive selection of movies and TV shows.

There’s also a moving map feature which I enjoyed keeping an eye on throughout the flight…

…especially as routings in this region can often have some interesting turns.

Qatar Airways’ Boeing 787-9s also feature “Super Wi-Fi” as the airline calls it which is probably the best value in the industry.

Qatar Airways Wi-Fi Boeing 787-9

While all Qatar Airways Privilege Club members can enjoy one hour of free Wi-Fi you can otherwise buy a full flight pass for $10 which has no data caps.

Qatar Airways Wi-Fi pricing Boeing 787-9

Not only is the pricing phenomenal but the speeds are excellent. I was able to legitimately be as productive as on the ground and didn’t find myself waiting for pages to load etc.

Qatar Airways business class meal service

Qatar Airways offers a dine on demand menu in business class. The menu read as follows:

There’s also a very extensive selection of beverages. The wine list read as follows:

Meanwhile the rest of the drink list read as follows:

Before takeoff we were already asked if we wanted to place an order and when we wanted to eat. It’s great to have that kind of flexibility.

Qatar Airways has a cocktail menu so for after takeoff I decided to order an aperol spritz while Ford had an old fashioned. It’s nice to be able to order cocktails and it’s something I wish we’d see more airlines offer. The cocktails were reasonably good for being on a plane though could’ve been better (or probably should have had ice).

Qatar Airways business class drinks

We decided to have dinner about an hour into the flight. I found the menu to be significantly scaled back compared to the last time I flew Qatar Airways on a flight like this as there were fewer snack and appetizer options. While I do think this represents a scaling back context is important here — Qatar Airways is still more or less in a league of its own when it comes to catering on a flight like this.

To start I decided to order the Arabic mezze which included hummus tabouleh and baba ghanoush served with Arabic bread. This was served with a tasty bread selection as well as butter plus a choice of olive oil.

Qatar Airways business class starter — Arabic mezze

Ford had the seared beef fillet as his starter which came with a waldorf salad and horseradish dressing.

Qatar Airways business class starter — seared beef fillet

There were three main course choices and they included lamb belly duck confit or a vegan option. I appreciate that Qatar Airways now consistently has a vegan option in business class so I decided to order that. The vegan menu item was a pesto glazed celeriac steak with Mediterranean risotto and steamed seasonal vegetables. The dish was pretty tasty and I had a glass of sauvignon blanc to go along with it.

Qatar Airways business class main course — pesto glazed celeriac steak

After the main course I ordered a cheese plate which was beautifully presented.

Qatar Airways business class meal — cheese plate

Lastly I ordered the classic tiramisu which was great.

Qatar Airways business class dessert — classic tiramisu

To be honest I’ve had better meals in Qatar Airways business class but this was still very good. The menu is definitely more limited than in the past but then again it’s not like most other airlines have bigger menus.

As we approached Doha I decided to order an iced cappuccino and I was offered a box of Godiva chocolates to go along with it. I love Qatar Airways’ coffee selection.

Qatar Airways Boeing 787-9 business class bed

While I didn’t get any sleep on this (fairly) short daytime flight I did check out the bed both in a window seat and in a center seat. In bed mode the seat is comfortable and well designed — it’s spacious cozy and I felt like there was enough space even though I’m a side sleeper who tends to bend my knees a bit. Meanwhile I’ve been in plenty of reverse herringbone seats where I felt my knees were pushed up against the side of the seat.

If you’re traveling with someone the center seats are cool in that you can fully lower the partition and have your heads next to one another. The catch is that your bodies are angled away from one another so this isn’t the same double bed you’d find in Qsuites. Nonetheless it’s nice to be close to a companion at least.

On the Boeing 787-9 both of Qatar Airways’ business class lavatories are located behind the cabin near door two. There’s one on each side and they each have a window which sure is cool.

The bathrooms were well maintained and had a variety of amenities including dental kits shaving kits and Diptyque toiletries. This is totally random but I’m curious — do any OMAAT readers shave on planes? I could see myself doing it in the Emirates A380 shower suite but that’s about it…

The crew on this flight was great — they were friendly attentive and always happy to fulfill any requests. End of story.

Qatar Airways arrival in Doha

At around 10:45PM Doha time the captain announced we would soon be commencing our descent and should be landing in about 30 minutes. While we initially made good progress on our descent we ended up having a rather circuitous approach.

Map approaching Doha

We landed in Doha at 11:35PM. Just like during takeoff I enjoyed watching the nose camera during this phase of flight.

We arrived at our gate at 11:40PM five minutes behind schedule.

Bottom line

I’m thrilled I had the chance to fly Qatar Airways’ new Boeing 787-9 business class as the Adient Ascent seat is one we’ll likely see on several more airlines. The new 787-9 business class suite is great though I think Qsuites still has the edge.

In terms of soft product Qatar Airways continues to hit it out of the park with a dine on demand concept an excellent drink selection and great bedding and amenities. As someone who likes to stay connected while traveling I also love Qatar Airways’ “Super Wi-Fi” where you can get unlimited high speed Wi-Fi with no data caps for just $10.

In fairness the experience is definitely scaled back a bit compared to what it used to be. There were no nuts with the first drink service and the menu was smaller than in the past. Still two years into the pandemic it was so nice to take a business class flight that actually felt “normal” again. Qatar Airways is in a league of its own when it comes to business class in my opinion.

Nora Rabah an aspiring biotechnology executive whose family had struggled with the U.S. health care system as Syrian immigrants was drawn to focus on expanding access to therapies. Andrew Foley a consulting manager at a boutique life sciences strategy firm hoped to apply learnings across the scientific and commercial domains to help launch new biopharma products.

Pienica Rabah Foley and the other members of the inaugural cohort of Harvard’s MS/MBA Biotechnology: Life Sciences Program—a joint degree offered by Harvard Business School (HBS) with the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and Harvard Medical School (HMS) through the Harvard Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology (HSCRB)—represent a diverse array of backgrounds and interests but they share a common goal: to become innovative leaders working at the nexus of business science and society.

Launched in 2020 and supported by a gift from the Chris and Carrie Shumway Foundation the MS/MBA program is part of a broader effort backed by the Shumways to bridge the worlds of business and science by fostering an environment of collaboration and innovation across Harvard that will advance work on groundbreaking research and educate future leaders in the life sciences. The gift provides funding for programming faculty research student financial aid and curriculum development—including the ethical implications of new therapeutics. It also bolsters HBS’s ability to partner with entrepreneurs and practitioners in the field to create new research and design executive education programs to serve their unique needs.

“Harvard has created an exceptional ecosystem that can develop and cultivate talented professionals across medicine business and life sciences who are best positioned to tackle global health challenges” says Chris Shumway MBA ’93. “With Harvard geographically situated at the epicenter of Boston’s world-class life sciences community with access to some of the leading hospitals pharma and biotechnology companies we believe a tremendous opportunity exists to foster cross-pollination of ideas by marshaling the resources of Harvard and connecting with industry leaders to quickly understand and solve problems.”

Known as Shumway Fellows the MS/MBA student cohort builds a tightly knit community drawing on each other’s diverse experiences. Fellows study general management at HBS and life sciences at HSCRB a joint department of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and HMS. Learning in this cross-School environment at the intersection of disciplines gives students the tools to approach problem-solving through a unique lens. It also fosters an entrepreneurial perspective empowering them to launch grow and lead transformative organizations that will spur the ethical commercialization of new drug discoveries and therapeutics.

“Programs like this leverage the extraordinary resources of Harvard including the expertise of the exceptional faculty co-chairs who helm the MS/MBA degree” says Shumway. “Leaders born out of these programs will be equipped to drive organizations at the forefront of groundbreaking discoveries with the mindset needed to solve complex problems worldwide.”

Since beginning the two-year program Pienica has had opportunities to coordinate a panel featuring senior leaders of the COVID-19 pandemic response from the U.K. Nigeria and India; collaborate on a tech venture with a PhD candidate from MIT through a student-run incubator; and explore business development through an internship with a biotechnology company.

“On the MBA side the case method has given me the opportunity to listen to the opinions of fellow students who enable me to look at problems through a manifold of new perspectives” says Pienica. “On the MS side I get to tap into the scientific way of thinking again and learn how to enable disruptive scientific developments to achieve positive impact at a large scale. I’m thrilled to be part of this supportive and stimulating community.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

MDS/MPN-RS-T-associated anemia causes fatigue reduced quality of life and worse survival [345]. Patients with MDS/MPN-RS-T have favorable overall survival compared to patients with MDS-RS [6]; however ~50% of patients require red blood cell (RBC) transfusions resulting in protracted transfusion dependence. Patients with MDS/MPN-RS-T also have a fourfold higher thrombotic event risk compared to patients with MDS with ring sideroblasts (MDS-RS) [7]. Treatment of MDS/MPN-RS-T aims to improve anemia reduce thrombotic event risk lower platelets and/or modify the disease course [6 8]. However data supporting the efficacy of these treatments are scarce.

Luspatercept is a first-in-class erythroid maturation agent that binds several transforming growth factor-β superfamily ligands enhancing late-stage erythropoiesis [9]. The results of the phase 3 MEDALIST study (NCT02631070) [10] led to its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of anemia in adults with lower-risk MDS-RS or MDS/MPN-RS-T requiring ≥2 RBC units/8 weeks after erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) failure [11]. Here we report a post hoc analysis of luspatercept efficacy and safety in patients with MDS/MPN-RS-T from the MEDALIST study. The MEDALIST study enrolled 229 adults with lower-risk MDS-RS who required ≥2 RBC units/8 weeks and were refractory or intolerant to ESAs [10]. Patients were randomized 2:1 to luspatercept or placebo administered subcutaneously every 3 weeks for 24 weeks. Luspatercept starting dose was 1.0 mg/kg with titration to a maximum of 1.75 mg/kg according to transfusion requirements and adverse events [10]. The diagnosis of patients with MDS/MPN-RS-T in the intention-to-treat population was performed using cytomorphologic cytogenetic and molecular genetic results and blood counts.

Of the 229 patients in MEDALIST study 23 (10.0%) had MDS/MPN-RS-T; 14 were randomized to luspatercept and 9 to placebo. Baseline characteristics that differed between the two arms included lower median leukocyte count (4.8 vs 7.5 × 109/dL) and serum ferritin (1062 vs 1460 µg/dL) and higher serum erythropoietin (sEPO) (71.9 vs 54.0 U/L) (Fig. 1A). Median (range) follow-up times were 27.4 (3.5–35.6) and 13.8 (3.3–32.2) months in the luspatercept and placebo arms respectively.

The primary endpoint in the MEDALIST study was RBC transfusion independence (RBC-TI) ≥8 weeks during weeks 1–24. Secondary endpoints included: modified hematologic response–erythroid (mHI-E; mean hemoglobin increase ≥1.5 g/dL [patients receiving <4 RBC units/8 weeks at baseline] or a reduction of ≥4 units RBC transfusion [patients receiving ≥4 RBC units/8 weeks at baseline] over 56 consecutive days) [12]; ≥1.0 g/dL hemoglobin increase from baseline over 56 consecutive days during weeks 1–24; rates of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML); and incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). A post hoc analysis of clinical benefit (defined as RBC-TI ≥8 weeks and/or mHI-E during weeks 1–24) was also performed. All P values are descriptive and not adjusted for multiplicity.

As of July 2019 a significantly higher proportion of patients with MDS/MPN-RS-T randomized to luspatercept achieved RBC-TI ≥8 weeks during weeks 1–24 (64.3 vs 22.2%; P = 0.028); mHI-E (71.4 vs 11.1%; P = 0.006); and clinical benefit (78.6 vs 33.3%; P = 0.034) vs placebo (Fig. 1B). The median (range) time from clinical benefit start to the end of treatment was 94.6 (range 8.0–150.0) weeks in the luspatercept arm and 23.9 (range 23.7–57.9) weeks with placebo. A numerically higher number of low transfusion burden patients (<4 units/8 weeks) randomized to luspatercept vs placebo achieved RBC-TI ≥8 weeks (5/6 [83.3%] vs 2/4 [50.0%]; P = 0.285) during weeks 1–24 and a significantly greater proportion achieved mHI-E (4/6 [66.7%] vs 0/4 [0.0%]; P = 0.046) (Fig. 1C). A numerically higher number of high transfusion burden patients (≥4 units/8 weeks) randomized to luspatercept vs placebo achieved RBC-TI ≥8 weeks (4/8 [50.0%] vs 0/5 [0.0%]; P = 0.068) and mHI-E (6/8 [75.0%] vs 1/5 [20.0%]; P = 0.063) (Fig. 1C). RBC-TI ≥8 weeks during weeks 1–48 was achieved by 64.3% of patients randomized to luspatercept vs 33.3% for placebo (P = 0.088). RBC-TI ≥48 weeks at any time during treatment was achieved by 28.6% of patients randomized to luspatercept vs no placebo patients; among those patients in the luspatercept group who had reached RBC-TI ≥8 weeks at any time during treatment 40.0% achieved RBC-TI ≥48 weeks vs no placebo patients (Fig. 2A).

Despite limited numbers the value of luspatercept for patients with MDS/MPN-RS-T is supported by comparisons with data from the entire MEDALIST study population. The achievement of RBC-TI ≥8 weeks during weeks 1–24 among patients with MDS/MPN-RS-T randomized to luspatercept vs placebo (64.3 vs 22.2%) was higher than in the overall MEDALIST population (37.9 vs 13.2%) [10]. Similarly mHI-E was achieved in 71.4 vs 11.1% of patients with MDS/MPN-RS-T randomized to luspatercept vs placebo compared to 52.9 vs 11.8% in the overall MEDALIST population [10].

After 24 weeks of treatment patients randomized to luspatercept had increases from baseline in mean [standard deviation SD] hemoglobin (7.7 [0.5]–9.5 [1.1] g/dL) leukocytes (5.3 [2.6]–7.8 [4.1] × 109/dL) and neutrophils (3.4 [2.4]–5.1 [3.4] × 109/dL) while platelet levels remained stable (515 [156] and 539 [274] × 109/dL) (Fig. 2B). Although the increase in hemoglobin levels after 24 weeks among patients with MDS/MPN-RS-T was not significantly different between luspatercept and placebo the absolute magnitude of increase was nominally higher (+1.7 vs +0.9 g/dL) [10]. Patients randomized to luspatercept vs placebo had a significantly greater increase in mean leukocyte count but not mean platelet or neutrophil counts. At baseline patients with MDS/MPN-RS-T had a higher median platelet count than the overall MEDALIST population (447 vs 234 × 109/dL) as expected had lower median sEPO (59.9 vs 153.2 U/L) were less likely to have received iron chelation therapy (26.1 vs 48.5%) and had lower median transfusion burden (4.0 vs 5.0 units/8 weeks) consistent with their higher RBC-TI and mHI-E response rates [10].

The most common TEAEs of any grade in the luspatercept arm were dizziness nausea diarrhea and asthenia (Fig. 2C). TEAEs leading to discontinuation occurred in 2 of 14 (14.3%) patients in the luspatercept arm and 3 of 9 (33.3%) in the placebo arm. One patient randomized to luspatercept experienced a transient ischemic attack. One patient randomized to placebo experienced progression to AML (P = 0.202) vs none randomized to luspatercept.

Recommendations for the treatment of patients with MDS/MPN-RS-T include ESAs and transfusions for anemia and lenalidomide for anemia and platelet-level reduction [7 8]. Recommendations for the use of lenalidomide for patients with MDS/MPN-RS-T are based on case reports totaling 12 patients [13] and a retrospective analysis of 167 patients [14] rather than clinical trials; the use of ESAs is based on a single retrospective study which included 40 patients with MDS/MPN-RS-T of whom 45% achieved an erythroid response (hemoglobin increase ≥2.0 g/dL or RBC-TI ≥8 weeks for patients who required ≥4 units/8 weeks) [15] compared to 71.4% of patients treated with luspatercept (refractory or ineligible for ESAs) in the current study. However this comparison should be undertaken with caution given the different definitions of erythroid response.

In conclusion this subgroup analysis provides the first clinical trial data to support the efficacy of luspatercept in patients with MDS/MPN-RS-T a population who currently have no proven effective treatment options. Overall luspatercept was found to be effective—significantly reducing transfusion burden and improving mHI-E and leukocyte levels—with a generally well-tolerated safety profile.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzY5N2YyN2IzLTZiMjMtNDMyNi05NWI1LTAyYzI1NjIzZWVlMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pharma dealmaking hit by greater scrutiny of prices and competition,"Print this page

When Joe Biden was elected US president it soon became clear the pharmaceutical and biotech sectors would face tougher regulation. The new administration prioritised efforts to curb drug prices increases and toughen scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions.

In March last year the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) joined with its EU UK and Canadian counterparts to announce they would rethink their approach to M&A by “Big Pharma” noting the high volume of recent deals and fast-rising drug prices.

Two months later the Biden administration also backed a patent waiver for Covid-19 vaccines. This sent shivers through an industry that relies on intellectual property to generate profits and attract funding to develop new products.

But as President Biden prepares to deliver his first State of the Union address to Congress on March 1 many analysts say that the administration’s efforts to boost the power of consumers at the expense of the pharmaceutical industry have had only mixed success.

Drug pricing reforms that would give government agencies more power to regulate pricing remain stalled in Congress. Meanwhile European opposition to a Covid-19 patent waiver has blunted efforts to conclude talks on sharing intellectual property.

Nevertheless the uncertainties over drug pricing and the FTC’s flagging of tougher antitrust scrutiny have had a chilling impact on dealmaking. These twin factors have contributed to a slide in valuations across the biotech sector — where business models rely on the prospect of future M&A to tempt venture capital groups and other investors to fund risky early-stage development.

According to industry data group Evaluate Pharma there were just 112 biopharmaceutical takeover deals worth $85bn in 2021 — almost a third fewer than in 2020.

At the same time the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has fallen by more than a quarter since peaking in February 2021 reversing strong gains made during the prior two-year bull market. This compares with rises of two per cent and 11 per cent for the wider Nasdaq and S&P 500 indices respectively.

“Whenever a regulator implements a new regulation or in this case potentially a new way of interpreting to what degree they will regulate something what is needed the most is clarity” argues Brad Loncar a biotech investor.

“As far as I know since the FTC made this announcement in March of last year there has been no clarity offered on what might change compared to past reviews.”

This shift in emphasis by regulators towards promoting more competition and restraining price increases has caused many analysts to predict that the era of pharma megadeals — such as Bristol-Myers Squibb’s $74bn acquisition of Celgene in 2019 — may be over.

And it has also created uncertainty over how regulators will treat acquisitions of smaller companies with unique technology and drugs in development.

$74bn Equity value of Bristiol-Myers Squibb’s acquisition of Celgene in 2019

Some pharma executives have warned that any step up in regulation to block smaller deals could undermine the funding structure of the entire biotech industry.

“I understand they [FTC] are concerned about antitrust but they also have to understand that the expertise of a biopharmaceutical company is very different than that of a small biotech company” says Dean Li president of Merck Research Laboratories. “I don’t know that they totally appreciate the total ecosystem.”

He adds that drugs developed by smaller biotechs are typically brought to market with the support of larger companies — through clinical trials manufacturing and marketing — for the benefit of consumers.

Analysts say there is still no clear guidance on what types of deals could fall foul of the tougher approach signalled by the FTC and other global regulators which established a multilateral working group last year to consider pharma consolidation.

Arman Oruc partner in the antitrust and competition practice at law firm Goodwin says the working group is still consulting. It remains to be seen he adds whether it will shake up regulatory approaches to procedures remedies divestitures and other elements of dealmaking.

The degree of interaction between the FTC the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority the European Commission and the Canadian Competition Bureau had already been increased but there have not as yet been any unusual regulatory decisions or outcomes on M&A transactions Oruc says.

“It’s definitely more probing” he explains. “In terms of the analysis they [regulators] kick a lot more tyres if you will. They look into a lot more issues. And they certainly go into a level of detail that the agency [FTC] didn’t go into let’s say even in a transaction like the [2009 $68bn] Pfizer-Wyeth combination — a mega-deal like that.”

This tougher scrutiny by global regulators comes at a time when some big pharma groups such as Pfizer are flush with cash due to revenues earned from Covid-19 vaccines and treatments.

On February 8 Albert Bourla Pfizer chief executive said the company would accelerate its business development efforts and expected to add at least $25bn in revenues through M&A by 2030.

Other big pharma companies including Bristol-Myers Squibb Merck and Amgen are actively seeking to replenish their drug pipelines ahead of the loss of exclusivity later this decade of several blockbuster drugs which each earn more than $1bn per year.

David Elkins chief financial officer at Bristol-Myers Squibb says the company remained optimistic about adding to its drug pipeline and did not see a big change in the regulatory environment.

BMS is particularly interested in acquiring early stage prospects as well pursuing mid-stage bolt on acquisitions he adds.

The next test case many of us are watching is Pfizer’s acquisition of Arena Pharmaceuticals . . . As more of these things happen there will be greater regularity clarity on what can and cannot go through

“We think there is significant competition in the marketplace and there are plenty of assets in the therapeutic areas that we’re in” Elkins says. “There is still significant unmet medical need. So you know we remain optimistic about the prospects for future business development.”

Some industry experts say there is a need for test cases to be concluded in order to ascertain the full extent of the new boundaries in which the sector must operate.

“The next test case many of us are watching is Pfizer’s acquisition of Arena Pharmaceuticals” says Loncar. “As more of these things happen there will be greater regularity clarity on what can and cannot go through.”

Pfizer agreed a $6.7bn purchase of Arena a company with some overlapping of drugs targeting inflammatory bowel diseases in December 2021.

It had expected to close the deal within the first half of 2022 but recently notified investors that it had resubmitted its acquisition notice to the FTC. The move gives the regulator an extra 30 days to review the deal.

If regulators allow the Pfizer-Arena deal to proceed it could unleash pent-up demand for M&A. If however they intervene it would send a negative signal to the industry according to analysts.

“With more certainty will come more deal volume” says Loncar. “Big companies have cash they need to spend; what is needed is a clear idea of the guardrails around how — not if — to spend it.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBoYXJtYWxldHRlci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9idXN5LWRheS1mb3ItYmlvaGF2ZW4td2l0aC1wcm9wb3NlZC1idXktb2YtY2hhbm5lbC1iaW9zY2llbmNlcy1hbmQtYm1zLWRlYWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Busy day for Biohaven with proposed buy of Channel Biosciences and BMS deal,"US neuroscience drug developer Biohaven Pharmaceutical (NYSE: BHVN) on Friday announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Channel Biosciences a subsidiary of Knopp Biosciences and its Kv7 channel targeting platform – adding the latest advances in ion-channel modulation to Biohaven's growing neuroscience portfolio.

Daily Swing Chart Technical Forecast

The direction of the USD/JPY on Monday is likely to be determined by trader reaction to 115.375.

Bullish Scenario

A sustained move over 115.375 will indicate the presence of buyers. If this creates enough upside momentum then look for a surge into the intraday high at 115.780 this is followed by a minor top at 115.864.

Taking out 115.864 will indicate the buying is getting stronger. This is a potential trigger point for an acceleration into the resistance cluster at 116.339 to 116.345.

Bearish Scenario

A sustained move under 115.375 will signal the presence of sellers. The first downside target is the pivot at 115.096.

Buyers could come in on the first test of 115.096 but if it fails as support then look for a potential acceleration into the next support cluster at 114.442 – 114.411.

Brown is among a small number of universities that have agreed to discuss their investments in companies that do business in Israel in order to persuade student protesters to dismantle encampments. Mr. Sternlicht in a scathing email to The New York Times which he copied to Brown’s president Christina H. Paxson said the arrangement amounted to sympathy for Hamas which attacked Israel in October and described students protesting Israel’s actions in Gaza as “ignorant.”

“There should never be a vote when people do not have the facts” he wrote. “It’s not education it’s propaganda.”

Mr. Sternlicht 63 said no deal with protesters could be fruitful because the two sides did not agree on “facts and moral clarity” as well as the scale of Israel’s invasion of Gaza after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack in which about 1200 were killed and another 250 were taken hostage. Israel’s subsequent intense bombardment of the tightly packed area has left more than 34000 dead and drawn international condemnation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9icm93bi13aGl0ZS1lZ2dzLWNvc3QtY3VyaW91cy1jb25zdW1lci9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFSaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wNS8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9icm93bi13aGl0ZS1lZ2dzLWNvc3QtY3VyaW91cy1jb25zdW1lcg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why do brown eggs cost more than white eggs? Blame the bird,"New York CNN —

It’s a moment many shoppers grapple with at some point during a grocery run: Why does a carton of brown eggs cost more than a carton of white eggs?

It’s not what you might think. It’s not about one type being healthier or more natural or fancier than the other but really about the nitty-gritty of farm economics. It costs more to keep the brown egg-laying hen happy and well fed.

“Basically there is no difference between a brown egg and a white egg nutritionally. It has to do with the breed of the chicken” explained Daniel Brey owner of Brey’s Egg Farm a fourth-generation family egg farm in Jeffersonville New York. The farm produces more than 200000 white eggs a day.

Some breeds such as White Leghorn chickens lay eggs with white shells while other breeds such as Rhode Island Reds lay eggs with brown shells. According to Brey the cost and taste of the egg you buy – white or brown - is determined by what – and how much – is fed to the hen.

“It has a lot to do with the chicken feed” Brey said. “It costs more to make a dozen brown eggs because the chickens that produce them tend to eat more.”

Egg farmers say brown and white eggs are closely matched in their nutritional value. Edmund McNamara

Edmund McNamara and his wife Rose run Sova Farms in Norwich NY about 200 miles north of New York City’s Central Park. Sova Farms he said is organic certified by the United States Department of Agriculture for its brown eggs and its chicken pork and lamb.

The farm currently produces about 350 brown eggs daily but expects to bump that up to over 1000 brown eggs a day after receiving a delivery of more than 700 pullets (or young hens) on this month.

“All our eggs are brown but every once in a great while a chicken will lay a very light brown” he said adding that the eggs are sold directly to consumers in New York’s Westchester County.

Harder to find

In stores brown eggs tend to carry a premium – even if it’s just because of their color anomaly.

“Eggs come in many colors not just white and brown. Depending upon the breed some are even blue and green” said Joan Frank assistant program director dietetics with the University of California David Department of Nutrition. Still there is no difference in nutritional value of eggs based on the color of the shell she said.

“I think consumers for some reason have come to believe that brown eggs are healthier which they are not” Frank said.

Sova Farms is currently selling a dozen large brown eggs for $8. Store prices for organic pastured brown eggs can be as high as $10 for a dozen while the price of conventional brown eggs is between $4.50 to $6 in most stores.

A dozen white eggs is about $2.50 in stores according to the latest weekly government data up from $1.50 a dozen from a year ago.

Yet McNamara too said “there is really no nutritional difference between white and brown eggs.”

Phil Lempert a grocery industry analyst and editor of SuperMarketGuru.com estimated how much more shoppers typically pay for brown eggs versus their white counterpart. “If there’s brown eggs next to white eggs typically you’re going to pay anywhere between 10% to 20% more for brown eggs regardless of free range or organic” he said.

The egg-onomics of it all

David Anderson professor of agricultural economics (with a specialty in livestock economics) at Texas A&M University has studied egg pricing and factors that affect it on farms and in the supermarket.

Egg prices regardless of the color of the shell generally respond to swings in demand he said. “You have short-term seasonal events such as Easter. We always see holiday demand for eggs. In the fall we also see demand increase for eggs for holiday-related activities such as baking” Anderson said.

Thrown into the mix are other influences on egg prices such as the cost of chicken feed. “Feed costs have been falling This is helping egg producers. We had a record large crop last year in the US and we have much lower corn and soybean meal prices right now he said.

Brown eggs generally cost more in stores than white eggs. It has to do with the cost of the upkeep of the chicken breed that produces brown eggs. Edmund McNamara

On the flip side the latest outbreak of Bird Flu could keep egg prices elevated versus last year. If egg producers aren’t able to meet demand because they’ve had to cull their chicken population due to bird flu then that can raise prices.

Looking specifically at the economics of producing brown eggs versus conventional white eggs Anderson confirmed it does indeed cost more to produce the brown variety. “If it costs more to produce they’ll probably be priced higher to the consumer.”

But as to the “perception” that brown eggs are healthier than white eggs?

“It’s almost like what comes first the chicken or the egg?” Anderson said. “Did the companies advertise that first or did it come from consumers who think that brown eggs just must be healthier?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vc3BvcnQvYXJ0aWNsZXMvYzZweWtwcDFwMmpv0gEzaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9zcG9ydC9hcnRpY2xlcy9jNnB5a3BwMXAyam8uYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Land Norris: McLaren driver is 'everyone's favourite' says team chief Zak Brown.,"McLaren boss Zak Brown called Lando Norris “everyone’s favourite driver” after the Briton won his first grand prix in Miami on Sunday.

It took six seasons and a 110 starts before Norris 24 finally topped the podium at a grand prix with second his previous best finish.

""I think that was a massive win for Lando and a lot of support behind it chief executive director Brown told BBC 5 Live.

""I never met anyone who doesn't like Lando.""

The turning point in Sunday's grand prix came when Norris took advantage of the race restarting with 27 laps to go beating Red Bull’s world champion Max Verstappen into second.

Brown said that Norris is ""everyone's favourite driver or number two or number three but I've never heard even number four and I've certainly never heard anyone not like [him]”.

Norris' win could signal the beginning of an end to Red Bull's dominance with chief technical officer Adrian Newey leaving the team and some uncertainty around Verstappen's future.

Brown disagrees however: “No I think that would be a bit premature thinking their time has gone but clearly with everything that has been going on this year and now Adrian Newey leaving it’s clear that team has some issues beyond the race car"" he said.

Brown did not rule out McLaren making a move for Newey when asked about the matter before the grand prix.

""They will miss Adrian Newey and I believe there is some truth to the Max Verstappen rumours so stay on top of your game or you can quickly slide back"" he added.

The next race in the F1 calendar is in Imola Italy and will take place from 17-19 May.

""We just got to keep working away"" Brown said when asked about the next challenge.

Caesars Palace this week unveiled the multimillion-dollar renovation to its front entrance giving a revamped touch to the resort’s iconic ancient Roman aesthetic.

Along with new mosaic tiling and a colorful domed ceiling a 15-foot-tall statue of Augustus Caesar standing beneath an ornate chandelier in the center of the lobby now welcomes resort guests.

“Caesars Palace set the standard for luxury and grandeur when it opened in 1966 delivering experiences unlike anywhere else in the world. Since then the resort has proudly been a change-maker and trendsetter in Las Vegas. As we create the next wave of extraordinary offerings for our guests throughout the property we are thrilled to reopen our front doors with a dramatic new main entrance” Sean McBurney regional president of Caesars Entertainment said in a statement.

Caesars Entertainment announced plans for the redesigns in July. More renovations are on the way for Caesars Palace. The resort is planning to unveil its revamped lobby bar and gaming areas soon according to McBurney.

“Once complete this will be the arrival and gaming experience that Caesars Palace deserves and will set the tone for everything we offer at the iconic resort” McBurney said.

The changes to the Caesars Palace lobby and front entrance are just some of the renovations happening at Caesars properties.

The company also started a multimillion-dollar refresh of the Nobu Hotel Caesars Palace in October to renovate the luxury boutique hotel’s 182 guest rooms.

Another Caesars Entertainment property Bally’s Las Vegas is being rebranded as the Horseshoe a legendary casino moniker that dates to the 1950s Las Vegas and the days of Benny Binion. The rebranding and renovations for the Horseshoe are expected to be finished by the end of the year.

After a 20-show stint at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace that had fans flying out to Sin City in droves last year the R&B superstar is returning to the stage for a new show with big surprises and a revamped performance. Few artists typically return to residency so quickly but when fan demand and talent desire intersect the time is always right.

“Success is always a reason to come back again right?” Usher said ahead of the show’s announcement.

“I felt like it actually ended before I wanted it to” he added. “ So I just took my time and figured out where I could go that I felt would really support the type of show that I would put on and give me an opportunity to shock my audience again.”

The exclusive only-in-Vegas spectacular will be packed with smash hits spanning the multi-talented entertainer’s 20-year career.

“The show that you experienced at the Colosseum is going to totally be different than what you’re going to experience at Park MGM” he said. “There were elements that we had to make adjustments to because of COVID. I’m going to have a full band this time that’s one thing I can tell you.”

On top of a full band the new immersive new show will incorporate audience interaction and staging throughout the 5200-seat entertainment venue. With a new innovative setup every guest will have an up-close and personal experience with the 8-time Grammy-winning superstar. He even plans to perform some new music.

“Matter of fact by the time we get to July people will have heard new music from me” he said. “Who knows my album could be ready to come out close around the time that we launched the entire show.”

This album would be Usher’s first solo venture in 5 years since 2016’s Hard II Love. Of course the R&B landscape and music in general have each shifted some since that time. As a veteran crooner and blueprint-builder of modern R&B Usher is more than ready to not only add what’s missing but contribute to what’s present.

Article continues after video.

“My voice didn’t change it got better” he observed of his place in today’s soundscape. “I think that I’m mindful of where music is and I’m also too mindful of what I think is a necessity. What I do as an artist don’t nobody do. What I do and what I offer as a performer nobody does. So this is an opportunity for me to touch on all the things that I know are a necessity and also to just participate.”

“I love where music is. I don’t feel like it’s missing anything but I think that we can add new flavors. And now that we have technology to play with we can do things that we couldn’t do in the ’90s in the 2000s” he said. “Now I’m happy and I’m just exploring and just excited to educate people about what it is to be a live performer.”

Part of that live show excitement is his now-famous skating performance of “Don’t Waste My Time” which went viral last year as concertgoers shared video. Now that he’s seen the vigorous fan response he’s planning on delivering on what works.

“Now imagine how hard it is to skate and sing!” he laughed. “But looking at artists like Gene Kelly as a kid I managed to be able see these things that became inspiration to me. I don’t know if I could even see myself in those characters because they were white. But there was something amazing about what they were doing that made me say one day I’ll have the opportunity to be that.”

While crafting an unforgettable experience for his fans recording new tracks and plotting his big return to the R&B landscape Usher is also enjoying family duties. As a father of four including two babies under age two it’s a juggling act that the singer is still figuring out.

“I think everybody had to figure that out over the last year. First and foremost being in the space with each other” he said referencing the new stay-at-home culture that we’ve all adjusted to over the last 24 months.

“To be honest managing my five-month-old and my 16-month-old girl is probably the easiest thing because they don’t really talk back” he explained. “The hardest part is my teenagers. I’m not Usher to my kids I’m Dad to my kids.”

“Because they’re quick they say little slick stuff like they’re talking back. But they’re boys. It’s really a lot but I’m enjoying the whole process. I’m enjoying what it is to find that balance between being Dad and also still remaining who I am as an artist.”

Overall Usher is ready to get back on the stage in grander fashion at a fuller capacity. With the nation moving from pandemic precautions to endemic adjustments audiences are now vaccinated boosted and ready to return to see their favorites grace the stage once again. As was the case for many of us Usher says his prior residency and preparation for his next one have taught him perseverance through the unforeseen.

“The one thing that I will say I learned in putting that show on is that the

show must go on and that’s life. Right now we’ve been trying to figure out how to get back to normal. And maybe it isn’t exactly the way that it was but life goes on and the show must go on. We have to figure out what the next step is.”

It was the 26-year-old British singer's first major concert in Detroit and she worked the stage like a seasoned veteran singing dancing and dominating her way through her 18-song setlist and keeping the mood buoyant and bouncy throughout. The 90-minute show was part '70s roller disco — several of her dancers donned roller skates and spun around the stage like they were born to roll — and part trip to the cosmos all encased inside of a heart-shaped mirror ball.

The tour stop came on her ""Future Nostalgia"" tour named for her March 2020 album which was released just two weeks into the shutdown brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. For Lipa's fans the album was an escape from the eminent dread of the global health crisis and Friday's show was a release for both the crowd and for the performer who held center stage throughout the evening.

""I'm so (expletive) happy to be here tonight"" Lipa told the audience of mostly twentysomething groups of gal pals and couples midway through the show. ""We've been waiting to put this show on for two years.""

It was a rich production that utilized a main end stage and a smaller stage near the center of the arena the two connected by a catwalk. Lipa was joined on stage by a team of 10 dancers — they were given their own intro video complete with credits at the top of the show — and four backup singers along with a four-piece backing band tucked onto the wings of the stage lowered a half-step below everyone else.

A large video screen projected images to help set the mood of the songs — a voyage under the sea on ""We're Good"" and several trips through outer space sprinkled elsewhere — while lasers confetti canons and a balloon drop gave fans plenty of visuals to binge on.

But Lipa's confidence and her control of the stage was the best stage trick of the night. She has a sturdy and commanding live presence and never showed the effects of her constant work on the stage; if she was winded at any point she never let on. She always held the audience's eye while channeling the energy of any number of pop stars past from Cher to Madonna to Gwen Stefani to Lady Gaga.

In the span of just two albums — ""Future Nostalgia"" was preceded by her 2017 self-titled debut set — Lipa has amassed a sizable number of smash hits including seven that have blown past the 1 billion streams threshold on Spotify.

Those songs got a workout on Friday: ""New Rules"" her breakout hit was given a sort of ""Singin' in the Rain"" treatment with her dancers incorporating umbrellas into their routine; ""Levitating"" was performed while well levitating on a platform that flew over the general admission crowd on the floor; and ""One Kiss"" was given a full dance party treatment in the center of the smaller stage while Lipa and her dance crew tossed out balloons and other goodies into the crowd.

Meanwhile ""Cold Heart"" her current hit with Elton John which interpolates Sir Elton's ""Rocket Man"" was given a mellow moment with Lipa and her dancers sitting on the stage while a taped Elton chimed in via video screen.

Marks were made to be hit and the show worked like clockwork; it may have been exactly 90 minutes down to the second and if it wasn't that seemed like the goal. That is by no means meant as a knock: for a show that was built like a machine it functioned like one too and gave fans a canvas to sing along to dance and to let go for a few hours in a world that's not getting any lighter anytime soon.

Opener ""Physical"" — go ahead and add Olivia Newton-John to that above list of influences and forebears — set the tone for the night with Lipa dressed head to toe in a form-fitting fluorescent green catsuit accented by highlighter heels. ""Baby keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice"" she sang throwing down a gauntlet that both she and the crowd followed like they were orders sent from above. It was plenty to be nostalgic about in the future but in the present it was simply a blast.

Smart decision that.

The 26-year-old British singer’s Future Nostalgia Tour show was absolutely worth the wait. The concert was pop diva spectacle done right filling its nearly 95 minutes with the requisite high-production eye candy exuberant choreography and hit singles such as “Levitating” “Don’t Start Now” and “Break My Heart.” But unlike many of her (mostly older peers) such as Madonna Janet Jackson Lady Gaga or Katy Perry Lipa avoided any speed bumps — there were no grand conceptual statements no long-winded discourses no quizzical video interludes to give her time to change costumes.

Rather Lipa hit go and didn’t stop and still managed to tick off all the boxes we expect from these kinds of shows. She was there to entertain not outrage or provoke and Future Nostalgia was all the more successful because of that.

And was a great deal of fun too.

Following opening sets by Caroline Polacheck and Lolo Zouai Lipa came out looking long and lean in yellow getting “Physical” with 10 dancers four musicians and four backup singers and working the length of the multi-tiered stage whose arrow-shaped ramp extended into the middle of the LCA floor. The gang choreography was fluid and unforced surrounding Lipa with movement and deftly embodying her potent brand of contemporary disco.

The 19-song show itself was divided into four “acts” with five outfit changes for Lipa plus a pair of encore numbers. She offered the whole of her 2020 sophomore album “Future Nostalgia” plus bonus tracks such as “Fever” and “We’re Good” and just two from her self-titled 2017 debut. “Love Again” was performed against a high-definition video backdrop of a red-hued canyon — one of the night’s most arresting images — while “Cool” found a pair of roller skaters nimbly circling Lipa.

The abundance of visual highlights also included a cube of light bulbs that lowered to just above the stage during “Break My Heart” and “Be the One” a balloon drop during “One Kiss” and Lipa literally “Levitating” on a moving platform amidst moons and stars hanging from the arena ceiling. None of that obscured the caliber of the music however and one dance-centric late-show segment spotlighted Lipa’s collaborations with Calvin Harris (“One Kiss”) and Silk City (“Electricity”). Elton John turned up as well via pre-recorded video to sing his parts on their hit “Cold Heart” — which he also performed at his LCA shows earlier in the month.

Lipa finished with “Don’t Start Now” triumphant inside a storm of confetti. It may have taken awhile to get here but Lipa’s Nostalgia will surely be something fans will remember fondly in the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvcmxkYXRsYXMuY29tL2NpdGllcy9sYXMtdmVnYXMtbmV2YWRhLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las Vegas Nevada - WorldAtlas,"From a small desert railroad service center in the early 20th century to America's fastest-growing city by 1999 Las Vegas is the only major metropolis in the famed American West to be founded in the 1900s. First incorporated in 1905 the largest city in Nevada is often known simply as ""Vegas"" a haven of spectacular entertainment fancy and elaborate hotels and of course plenty of vast casinos. It attracts millions of visitors each year even if most of them flock to a narrow 7 km portion of the city known as ""The Strip.""

Geography And Climate Of Las Vegas

Aerial view of Las Vegas.

Located in Clark County Nevada Las Vegas sits within a basin in the Mojave Desert called the Las Vegas Valley. Roughly 600 square miles in size it also houses the community of Paradise and dry mountain ranges and desert vegetation dominate its surrounding landscape. These include the Spring Mountains in the West and the famed Mount Charleston. With an altitude of nearly 12000 feet above sea level it is the highest point in Clark County.

Deriving its name from the Spanish for ""The Meadows"" Las Vegas has a hot and dry climate that lasts for most of the year; on average the daily temperature is 20 C (68 F) with highs up to 27 C (80 F) and lows of 13 C (56 F). However temperatures of up to 40 C (104 F) have often been recorded in the summertime. As a desert city Las Vegas lies only 160 km east of the famed Death Valley which on average only sees 100 mm of rain a year! When there is rainfall however it runs the risk of turning torrential and very destructive flash floods have affected the perimeters of Las Vegas in the past.

Tourism In Las Vegas

Though it has a modest population of 641000 (based on data from 2020) everything else in Las Vegas is indeed superlative. A multibillion-dollar economic driver the city hosts colossal hotels (with thousands of rooms in each) the largest glass pyramid in the world and replicas of some of the world's most iconic landmarks. Tens of millions of tourists flock to ""Sin City"" each year making it one of the United States' leading vacation destinations. Las Vegas typically draws more visitors than both the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone National Park.

""The Strip""

The aforementioned ""Strip"" is of course what first comes to mind when thinking of Las Vegas which houses many unique themed hotels and casinos; from Treasure Island Caesars Palace The Venetian The Bellagio The Luxor and more. ""The Strip"" features an endless array of bright lights entertainment venues restaurants and large-scale imitations of some of the world's best-known landmarks. These include the Eiffel Tower a section of the Brooklyn Bridge and of course the great Egyptian Sphinx.

Spend an afternoon on Venice's famed lagoons and take a gondola ride at The Venetian go on a ride of the High Roller Ferris Wheel enjoy the spectacular water fountain show at the Bellagio view the erupting Volcano at the Mirage Hotel or go to the very top of the Stratosphere Tower some 1500 feet in the air! These and many more exciting sights define ""The Strip"" with never a dull moment to be found.

Other Attractions In Las Vegas

Just off ""The Strip"" visitors can also visit ""Old Vegas"" and the famed Fremont Street a pedestrian-only area. For a five-block radius tourists can look up and enjoy the ""Fremont Street Experience"" and see an LED canopy of lights that illuminate the sky in constantly changing colors and other designs.

For fans of fast cars a visit to the Las Vegas Motor Speedway is a cannot miss opportunity; 24 km from the city center the speedway is a 1200-acre complex of multiple racing tracks that houses NASCAR races and other local racing events. Those with enough cash to spare can even take a Ferrari or Lamborghini for a test drive around the track unleashing their inner race car driver!

The Hoover Dam.

And of course the world-renowned Hoover Dam the major supplier of hydro-electrical power for the region is always a popular destination to explore. Located 50 km from Las Vegas tourists can take a subterranean tour of the Dam's generators and get an up-close look at this engineering marvel. Afterward why not take a leisurely boat ride on the artificial Lake Mead? A reservoir of Hoover Dam the 180 km long lake eventually connects to the Colorado River a major river of the Southwestern United States.

Crime In The City

But beyond the millions of bright lights of ""The Strip"" Las Vegas is also a regular city with schools churches shopping centers and all the amenities of any metropolis. Drawing fame and most of its income from its Sin City component (making it one of the wealthiest cities in the United States) Las Vegas' residential neighborhoods have struggled with higher rates of local personal and property crimes. Illegal drug use has troubled the city for decades as residents attempt to redefine their home as more than just a gambler's den.

Economy Of Las Vegas

A casino in Las Veagas.

Though tourism gambling and entertainment anchor Las Vegas' economy today in the 19th century through to its founding at the turn of the 20th century Vegas' economic prosperity was largely based on agriculture. In fact many outlying areas of the city still depended on farming and ranching as a main source of sustenance into the 1980s.

But the city's transformation into an entertainment mecca has made other economic enterprises seem minuscule compared to the great wealth generated by its main hub of activities. Since the 1990s Las Vegas has had one of the fastest-growing employment bases in the USA benefiting from a favorable business climate and a large labor pool.

A City Like No Other

The dazzling skyline of Las Vegas.

While the residential and local component of Las Vegas is often obscured by the city's more famous ""alter ego"" it is a fully formed city uniquely situated in the Nevada desert. Visitors may not descend on the town to see its churches schools and grocery stores but nonetheless Las Vegas has carved out its own success story; from a largely rural agricultural center to an entertainment and gambling juggernaut it is surely true that there is no place quite like Las Vegas.

He spent decades rising up the ranks at companies like Campbell Soup Kraft Foods and the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers.

The whole time he kept a dark secret: In 1965 at age 16 Miller pleaded guilty to the second-degree murder of another teenager in Philadelphia serving four and a half years in prison. Shortly after he served another five for a series of armed robberies.

Miller was publicly identified in the Philadelphia Daily News after pleading guilty to the murder charge according to research conducted by Sports Illustrated but nobody seemed to notice as he entered and progressed through the corporate world. It stayed that way until October when he and his daughter Laila Lacy announced they were co-writing and publishing a tell-all memoir ""Jump: My Secret Journey From the Streets to the Boardroom.""

The memoir published last month — and writing it was freeing Miller told Sports Illustrated in October. More importantly he said: He hoped it could prove that formerly incarcerated people are capable of rehabilitation and success.

""It's really about making sure that people understand that formerly incarcerated people can make a contribution"" Miller said. ""And that person's mistake or the worst mistake that they make in their life shouldn't control what happens with the rest of [their] life.""

Miller now in his 70s added that ""some of the most creative intelligent smart people"" he has met were in prison. All of their talents and abilities were ""being wasted inside the jails"" he said.

While incarcerated Miller pursued an education using Pell grants available to inmates. Then he attended college through a day-release program. On Sunday he told CNN that the experience ""made me start to believe that I could actually change my life.""

Around the same time as his release he graduated from Temple University at age 30. He was an interview away from landing a position at a major accounting firm when he decided to disclose his criminal background. He didn't get the job and spent the rest of his career hiding his previous incarceration.

Miller told Sports Illustrated he never lied on an application but could usually find loopholes. Most applications only asked if he'd been convicted in the prior five years he said. But as he became more successful he started suffering migraine headaches and nightmares.

""There was always this tension and this fear that somehow this is going to come out and it's going to ruin everything I've built up to this point"" he told CNN.

Lacy told Sports Illustrated that she spent years encouraging Miller to break that tension by writing the book. And Miller said he consulted with a close circle of friends and colleagues including NBA legend Michael Jordan and Nike co-founder Phil Knight before deciding to do it.

Ahead of the book's release some controversy did erupt: The family of the teenager Miller killed in 1965 felt blindsided especially when the Sports Illustrated article publicly named the victim then-18-year-old Edward White.

In December Miller met with White's sister Barbara Mack and his two children Hasan Adams and Azizah Arline. Mack and Adams told the New York Times they could forgive Miller. Arline said she needed more time.

According to the Times Miller in is discussions with the family to establish a scholarship foundation funded in perpetuity to help White's descendants — and potentially others too — attend college or trade school.

""If nothing else comes out of this book … the most important thing for me is to be able to know that in spite of the pain and hurt I caused their family that they're willing to forgive me"" Miller told CNBC's ""The News with Shepard Smith"" last month.

""He could have gotten [the surgery] scheduled and done earlier had he been more preventative about his health"" Diaz said.

The 210-acre farm at 944 Providence Road could potentially open another large swath of Chester County to developers.

The owner of the property is listed as Woodkirk and The Glenmede Trust. Its trustees include M. Roy Jackson and his children who are Rockefeller descendants. William Rockefeller Jr. former president of Standard Oil is Jackson’s grandfather. He was the brother of the founder of Standard Oil John D. Rockefeller.

The property has not been on the market for nearly nine decades according to Lavinia Smerconish the broker who has the listing.

The parcel has no conservation easement and its owners have not expressed any objections to the land being developed. Despite the asking price of more than $142000 per acre the property has already seen interest from both homeowners and developers.

“It seems excessive but that’s only because the amount of ground being offered is a large amount of ground” said Smerconish. “But it’s certainly not excessive when you look at what the product is.”

You Can Create a Credit Report Without Taking on Debt -- Here's How,"Approximately 26 millions Americans are considered ""credit invisible"" -- which means they have no credit history according to Experian TransUnion or Equifax America's three major credit bureaus. Of this number Black and Hispanic Americans are more likely to have no credit history than whites and Asian Americans.

Not having a credit history can present major difficulties if you're hoping to obtain loans from banks and other lenders or trying to achieve basic measures of livelihood such as renting an apartment purchasing a car or even getting a job. Historically credit reports can only be established through traditional methods -- repaying loans or using a credit card for example. However due to the cyclical nature of the American credit system if you lack a credit report it can be difficult to secure a loan or credit card in the first place.

The newly launched Experian Go service could help ""credit invisibles"" jump-start their credit by creating a free Experian credit report. Then you can increase your score by reporting on-time bill payments through Experian Boost or through traditional methods including using a credit card to establish on-time payment history.

Experian Go may be helpful to anyone struggling to establish credit but it's not the only way to put yourself on the financial map. Here's everything you need to know about Experian Go -- how it works who it's best for and what to consider before signing up.

What is Experian Go and how does it work?

Experian Go allows Americans without credit to create an Experian credit report almost instantaneously. Experian first rolled out this service in October 2021 to roughly 15000 people. It reports that on average 91% of users who linked everyday cash flow accounts to newly created credit reports went from no FICO score to 665 a measure of fair to good credit.

Experian Go's free membership also provides access to financial education and recommendations as well as a marketplace of financial products and offers. The company plans to pitch Go users credit cards -- its current partners are Petal and Capital One -- including cards intended for consumers with limited credit histories.

Jeff Softley president of Direct to Consumer at Experian Consumer Services explained how Experian Go allows consumers to create a credit profile and receive a credit score ""without taking on debt."" He went on: ""It's a big innovation because it's a stepping stone allowing consumers to gain a financial identity and enter the financial ecosystem on their terms.""

Once your Experian credit report is created through Experian Go you can start to build your credit and expect to see your FICO Score after about six months. If you don't want a credit card right away you can enroll in Experian Boost which links non-debt accounts such as phone utility and streaming bills to your Experian credit report. Just remember paying on time is key otherwise your credit could dip.

Ted Rossman a senior industry analyst at Bankrate (which is also owned by Red Ventures) sees Experian Go as a net positive. ""Our credit score is one of the most important numbers in our financial lives"" he explained. ""And Experian Go -- as a free secure beneficial program that enables credit building -- is ideal. It's also financially low-risk as Experian Go can't hurt your credit score.""

Who is Experian Go best for?

If you do not currently have a credit score or credit history Experian Go can help you get established. This option is best for anyone without credit who is struggling to get approved for a credit card loan or other credit-based account. Experian Go may also help if you need to establish credit history to get approved for an apartment or job but do not want to take on the risk of a credit card.

Drawbacks to consider

Although Experian Go is free and can help you get started on your credit-building journey there are some factors you should consider before signing up.

1. Experian Go only directly impacts your Experian credit report Experian Go only creates an Experian credit report. This means in order for lenders to see your newly established credit they'll need to pull data from Experian and not one of the other two bureaus. In addition it will also only work with the new credit scoring algorithm FICO Score 8. This means Experian Go will not directly help you get a mortgage as lenders will generally request all three of your credit reports and are also mandated to use older versions of FICO. Although Experian Go only benefits your Experian credit score Rossman notes that it can be used to establish credit at other bureaus. For example if you apply for a credit card that only pulls Experian data and you're approved this card will then show up on all three credit reports and that will allow you to begin building credit across all three credit bureaus. Most credit card providers only pull from one credit bureau -- however they don't advertise which one they use up front. So while this approach can help you get approved for a credit card it's a bit of a gamble. If the card provider uses Transunion or Equifax you could be denied right away since you won't have a credit report with either bureau. That said even without Experian Go you could apply for the Chime Credit Builder Secured Visa® Credit Card which doesn't require a credit check or the Petal® 1 ""No Annual Fee"" Visa® Credit Card which may combine your credit report with your banking spending and savings data to compile a Cash Score. You can also apply for a secured credit card -- a card that requires a security deposit as your credit line -- that does not require a credit check. All of these options can help you get established with all three credit bureaus.

2. Cybersecurity breaches may be a concern In an age where data sharing is a major concern and previous credit bureau cybersecurity breaches have resulted in widespread identity theft Experian Go will require you to provide access to personal and private data. However Rossman notes that ""regarding privacy concerns credit bureaus already possess a lot of the data Experian Go would potentially collect.""

3. Experian Go collects and sells your data Heightened data collection is often used by credit-monitoring companies such as Experian Go and Experian Boost to upsell customers products and services that may not be in their best financial interest-- and could even land them in debt. Rossman advises taking Experian Go's suggested products with a grain of salt and to be wary of marketing and cross-selling. That being said he adds ""I feel good about the partners they currently have. Capital One has a great reputation and Petal is also known as a good way for young people to gain credit.""

How to sign up

To enroll you'll need to download the free Experian mobile app and confirm your identity by submitting personal information such as your legal name address date of birth and the last four digits of your Social Security number. You will also have to upload some form of identity verification such as a driver's license or passport and take a selfie. Softley says the entire process takes an average of four minutes. Upon completion you'll have created your first credit report.

Can I build my credit score without Experian Go?

Yes. Although Experian Go can help you quickly create and build your Experian credit score you don't need this tool to establish credit. These traditional options will allow you to build your credit across all three credit bureaus.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2FkdmVudHVyZXMtZWxldXRoZXJhLXRoZS1iYWhhbWFzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,My 10 Favorite Jaw-Dropping Island Adventures on Eleuthera the Bahamas,"One of the reasons I first started coming to the Bahamas for my Travel Therapy TV show was to discover some unique unspoiled off-the-beaten-path islands where you could truly disconnect to reconnect relax and rejuvenate.

There are a staggering 700 islands in the Bahamas spanning more than five thousand miles. The government of the Bahamas says only 30 of the islands are inhabited and of those a little more than a dozen islands have emerged as top travel destinations.

So how did I pick Eleuthera to visit?

On my ""must have"" checklist I wanted breathtaking beaches crystal clear turquoise water friendly people great food and unique travel experiences. I found all of that and so much more on the wild and wonderful island of Eleuthera.

Eleuthera 200 miles from Florida is 110 miles long and just two miles wide with a population of around 11000 people. Originally settled by British Loyalists in the 1700s there's a rich history to go with Eleuthera's unique landscape of pink sand beaches pristine coral reefs jagged cliffs lush tropical forests and miles and miles of pineapple fields.

Eleuthera and the incredibly friendly local people quickly captured my heart. Eleuthera is where I go when I'm looking to recharge my imagination. The name Eleuthera is the Greek word for free and that's exactly how I feel when I'm on Eleuthera free from all the world's troubles free to appreciate all of nature's gifts that are here and free to slow down enough so I can enjoy it all.

To help you also fall in love with this fascinating island here are 10 of my favorite things to do on Eleuthera. Every one of these adventures except for Daddy Joe's restaurant is free and trust me all of these top things to do in Eleuthera are priceless!

1. The Sapphire Blue Hole

This Sapphire Blue Hole looks like a dream and it's one that can come true for anyone who visits Eleuthera. This is something that's always on my list of top things to do when traveling there. This famous Eleuthera natural phenomenon is an underwater cave filled with amazingly clear Sapphire blue water. It reminds me of the cenotes I visited in Mexico's Yucatan. Making this even more exciting to get into this blissful blue hole you have to jump off a cliff that's about 20-feet high and to get back out you have to climb a knotted rope. Trust me it's worth the effort.

Ocean Swings Eleuthera the Bahamas. (Photo courtesy of ©Karen Schaler/traveltherapytrips.com)

2. Eleuthera's ocean swings

Eleuthera's ocean swings off Russell Island are a new jaw-dropping adventure in the Bahamas that you can only get to by boat because these swings are literally in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean all by themselves. When I heard about these new ocean swings and saw a picture of them I knew I had to experience this. But let me tell you pictures can't even come close to showing how magical this setting really is. When I say jaw-dropping I mean it! All you need to do is anchor your boat jump into the water and wade out to your swing for an experience you'll never forget. The water was only about 3-feet high when I was there and the sand is silky soft. I dare you not to feel like a kid again when you start swinging. I found myself laughing with pure joy as I soaked up the amazing scenery and everything else in the world was forgotten.

Insider tip: It should go without saying but with my dermatologist's voice ringing in my ear I'm going to say it anyway. For all of your Eleuthera island adventures be sure to protect yourself with a lot of sunscreen and reapply often especially when you're on the water like this. Better to be safe than lobster-colored and sorry.

The Queens Bath Eleuthera the Bahamas. (Photo courtesy of ©Karen Schaler/traveltherapytrips.com)

3. The Queens Bath

The Queens Bath on Eleuthera is another natural wonder that you don't want to miss experiencing. I'm always mesmerized watching the waves from the powerful Atlantic Ocean crash into the rugged rocks and spill over into naturally carved out ""hot tubs"" as the locals like to call them. The sun then quickly warms this shallow water creating an ideal place to relax where you can discover some sea life and shells that wash up with the waves. I always recommend wearing tennis shoes so you can navigate around the rocks and thoroughly explore this fascinating area.

Insider tip: The locals in Eleuthera wanted me to be sure to share that if you visit The Queens Bath never stand too close to where the waves are crashing on the rocks. The huge unpredictable waves can quickly catch you off guard and take you out to sea and that's not the kind of adventure you're wanting to have here!

The Glass Window Bridge Eleuthera the Bahamas. (Photo courtesy of ©Karen Schaler/traveltherapytrips.com)

4. The Glass Window Bridge

Often called ""the narrowest place on earth"" Eleuthera's famous Glass Window Bridge along Queen's Highway is only about 30 feet wide at its narrowest point. The giant rock formation that surrounds the bridge is visually stunning because on the west side you can see the calm crystal-clear turquoise water of the Caribbean and on the east side you find the rugged deep navy blue Atlantic Ocean. If you want to get out anywhere to take pictures be very careful. Just like with the Queens Bath the waves can be very unpredictable so be mindful at all times so you're not swept away. When the waves are too high you can't drive across the man-made bridge so that's something to also beware of.

Insider tip: Keep an eye out when you fly into Eleuthera in case you can catch The Glass Window Bridge from your plane because this sight is even more spectacular from above.

Preacher's Cave Eleuthera the Bahamas. (Photo courtesy of ©Karen Schaler/traveltherapytrips.com)

5. Preacher's Cave

Eleuthera is an island rich in history and one place you shouldn't miss is Preacher's Cave. It's about ten miles outside the Bluff settlement. In 1647 this is where Captain William Sayle and his group of English Puritans found refuge after being shipwrecked at the Devil's Backbone a shallow treacherous reef that has sunk countless ships over the years. Captain Sayle's group is believed to be some of the first British residents in the Bahamas who later became known as Eleutheran Adventurers. The Preachers Cave earned its name when it was later used as a church by Captain Sayle and his group.

Insider tip: At the entrance of the cave don't miss seeing the placard that says ""William Sayle shipwrecked at Devil Backbone found refuge here. Sermons held 100 years.""

Tay Bay Beach Eleuthera the Bahamas. (Photo courtesy of ©Karen Schaler/traveltherapytrips.com)

6. Tay Bay Beach

Just steps from Preacher's Cave you'll find Tay Bay Beach one of my favorite beaches on Eleuthera and that's saying a lot because there are more than 120 beaches on the island. Secluded and peaceful Tay Bay Beach is perfect for taking a swim if you want to cool off after your sightseeing. You can also do a relaxing stroll on the beach where you often won't see another person in sight.

Insider tip: Right offshore is the section of Devil's Backbone that shipwrecked Captain Sayle and his group that ended up using Preacher's Cave for shelter. This legendary reef off of Northern Eleuthera is now a snorkeler's dream.

7. Gaulding Cay Beach

Another hidden gem beach in Eleuthera you shouldn't miss is Gaulding Cay Beach. The water is so clear here it's ideal for swimming and snorkeling where you can see all kinds of colorful fish. If you've always wanted to visit a private island here's your chance. When the tide is low enough you can walk over to Gaulding Cay a tiny speck of an island that's picture-perfect.

Daddy Joe's Restaurant Eleuthera the Bahamas. (Photo courtesy of ©Karen Schaler traveltherapytrips.com)

8. Daddy Joe's Restaurant

Just across the street from Gaulding Cay Beach and down the road from The Glass Window Bridge is one of my favorite places to eat in Eleuthera Daddy Joe's restaurant. The restaurant serves up mouthwatering local Bahamian food including my favorite Shelia's Fish Your Way where you can get Grouper (in season) or Mahi Mahi cooked to your liking blackened coconut crusted or grilled. The Daddy Joe's Burger is another local favorite with its 8-ounce Angus patty and special guava barbecue sauce. If you're looking for a cocktail Daddy Joe's has some fun ones like the Bahamian favorite Goombay Smash the Dizzy Izzy or the Tropical Storm Shaken Daiquiri. The names alone will make you want to say ""cheers!""

Insider tip: The owner Tiffany Johnson is lovely and in addition to her fantastic Daddy Joe's restaurant there's also a charming boutique on the property you'll want to check out.

Pink Sand Beach Harbour Island the Bahamas. (Photo courtesy of ©Karen Schaler/traveltherapytrips.com)

9. Day Trip to Harbour Island

Eleuthera and Harbour Island are almost always mentioned together and that's because if you visit one you really need to visit the other! Harbour Island is also one of my favorite islands in the world. It's easy to visit from North Eleuthera where you can just hop on a water taxi that will get you to Harbour Island's historic Dunmore Town in five minutes. Once on the island everyone rents golf carts to get around because this quaint tiny island is just three miles long and a mile wide.

For decades Harbour Island has been a laid-back playground for billionaire CEOs who cruise in on their superyachts and top celebrities who love this authentic hidden escape. Legendary for its spectacular pink sand beaches Harbour Island (Briland to its residents) will charm you with pastel-colored houses delicious restaurants unique local shops and luxurious boutique resorts. I love staying at Romora Bay Resort and Marina where the staff makes you feel like family. It's the best place on Harbour Island to catch the sunset have happy hour and enjoy live music at Romora Bay's Sunsets Restaurant.

Insider tip: For a quick tasty bite to eat don't miss Queen Conch restaurant for the freshest conch salad I've ever tasted. You can order from a cute stand for takeout or enjoy the new casual restaurant that's right on the water that also serves up other fresh fish favorites. If you see the friendly owners Lavon and Richard Percentie that I always love talking to and hearing their stories and history of the Island tell them Travel Therapy's Karen Schaler sent you and that I hope to see them again soon!

Spanish Wells the Bahamas. (Photo courtesy of ©Karen Schaler/traveltherapytrips.com)

10. Day Trip to Spanish Wells

Spanish Wells is another island you should make time to experience while in Eleuthera. On Spanish Wells you also get around by golf cart to enjoy the beach and a handful of restaurants and shops. Also popular taking a boat trip from Spanish Wells. This is the best way to see the surrounding area including Russel Island and Pig Island where you can see the swimming pigs or do some snorkeling and diving with several shipwrecks just off Northern Eleuthera.

Insider Tip: Be sure to ask about the lobster fishing out of Spanish Wells and see the lobster boats. Spanish Wells is the lobster capital of the Bahamas and is the main supplier of rock lobster for the Red Lobster restaurant chain in the U.S.

Top Things to Know when Traveling to Eleuthera Harbour Island and Spanish Wells in the Bahamas

COVID-19 restrictions

The Bahamian government has just changed COVID-19 restrictions. For the most recent changes check out my experience traveling to the Bahamas.

Best time to visit

Peak season in the Bahamas is from December to April with March seeing a lot of travelers for spring break so expect to see the most people and highest prices during this time. During peak season the weather is lovely — not too hot not too cold — averaging around the mid-70s. It can cool down in the evening so be sure to bring a light sweater or jacket especially if you're going out on a boat. After mid-April prices start to drop and you can see discounts of up to 60% but this is also when you see the most rain and storms so plan your trip accordingly. I also talked to a lot of people from Florida who like to bring their yachts in June and July and say it's the best-kept secret to visit this time of year.

Money power and time

The Bahamian dollar is the currency in the Bahamas but the US dollar is accepted everywhere. The conversion rate is 1:1. Make sure you have cash with you as not everywhere takes credit cards. The islands use the same standard voltage as the U.S. — 120 volt and the frequency is 60 Hz so you don't need a voltage converter when visiting the Bahamas which is in the Eastern time zone.

How to get to Eleuthera

A few years ago you had limited options if you wanted to fly to Eleuthera from the U.S. but thankfully that has all changed. Now you can fly direct to Eleuthera (ELH) on Delta out of Atlanta (ATL) or American Airlines out of Miami (MIA) and Charlotte (CTL) and Silver Airways out of Fort Lauderdale (FLL). Be sure to book your flight early during high season because seats book up fast.

The final tip for visiting Eleuthera

What I've always loved about Eleuthera is that you can do as little or as much as you like and truly feel like you've found your own little slice of paradise. Whether you want to walk for miles on stunning powder-soft sand beaches without seeing another soul or spend your days exploring all the adventures Eleuthera has to offer this Bahamian Island is a Travel Therapy escape of the very best kind.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ldHJvd2Vla2x5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzAyL2hvdC1waWNrcy1vZi10aGUtd2Vlay1kdWEtbGlwYS1haXJvdGljLWNhcGl0YWwtaXJpc2gtZmlsbS1mZXN0aXZhbC1hbmQtbW9yZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hot Picks of the Week: Dua Lipa AirOtic Capital Irish Film Festival and more!,"CAPITAL IRISH FILM FESTIVAL

LANDMARK THEATRES: OSCAR-NOMINATED SHORT FILMS 2022

Now that Landmark’s cineplexes including all three in the Washington area have fully reopened the national chain has revived its annual tradition of screening all short films nominated for Academy Awards in the run-up to Hollywood’s biggest night set for Sunday March 27.

Co-presented by Shorts HD and Magnolia Pictures Landmark offers three distinct programs of shorts grouped into the same category as their nomination whether Animated Short Documentary Short Subject or Live Action Short. There are no specifically LGBTQ-identified works among this year’s nominees but LGBTQ-adjacent highlights include one shot in the area. Audible by Matt Ogens and Geoff McLean follows the Maryland School for the Deaf football team although the Netflix-produced short is really a cautionary tale about discrimination and bullying and focused on Deaf Black star athlete Amaree McKenstry-Hall as he copes with the death by suicide of his gay deaf and Black best friend.

Documentaries also include When We Were Bullies a joint U.S./German film from Jay Rosenblatt Three Songs for Benazir from Afghanistan Pedro Kos and Jon Shenk’s Lead Me Home and Ben Proudfoot’s The Queen of Basketball.

Dealing with issues of racism violence and sexual assault the Live Action category is a mostly international affair save for K.D. Dávila and Levin Menekse’s Please Hold with On My Mind from Denmark The Dress from Poland The Long Goodbye from the U.K./Netherlands and Ala Kachuu (Take and Run) from Kyrgyzstan/Switzerland.

Finally this year’s Animated Shorts program isn’t the kind of light kid-oriented fare you might expect. In fact as the official release notes it’s “FOR ADULTS ONLY” given the male and female nudity and adult themes of the joint U.S. and Spanish film The Windshield Wiper and especially the “disturbing imagery animal abuse bestiality and rather extreme violence” of Bestia a Chilean film about an infamous torturer of the Pinochet regime.

The slate is rounded out by the Russian Boxballet the British/Canadian Affairs of the Art and the British Robin Robin. All three individual programs screen at Landmark’s E Street Cinema 555 11th St. NW. The Animated and Live Action programs also screen at Bethesda Row Cinema 7235 Woodmont Ave. Call 202-452-7672 or visit www.landmarktheatres.com.

DUA LIPA

This time two years ago Dua Lipa was already firing on all cylinders revving up promotion for her forthcoming second album a disco-fueled conceptual dance-pop masterpiece — and future Grammy winner for Best Pop Vocal Album — which is as different from her appealing and auspicious 2017 self-titled debut as day is to night. And by this point in 2020 Lipa had just kicked things off in the grandest and gayest way possible with a headline performance at Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras.

All was seemingly going as planned as if the stars were aligned for the aspiring stadium-filling superstar and diva-in-waiting — and then well you know. The pandemic lockdown would go on to inspire Lipa to plan an elaborate livestream in lieu of all the live shows that had been in the works for the remainder of 2020 and much of 2021. (Fun fact: That livestream Studio 2054 attracted 5 million viewers a record for a paid livestream at the time and also the Guinness World Recordholder for highest ticket sales for a paid livestream by a female artist.)

Last year in addition to forcing a second postponement of the Future Nostalgia Tour the ongoing pandemic would also compel Lipa to release a deluxe Moonlight Edition of the album. And that along with Club Future Nostalgia the imaginatively nostalgic time-warped remixed set that Lipa wisely tapped lesbian DJ The Blessed Madonna to oversee served to help keep the album and its songs in regular rotation.

But now lo and behold the time is really and truly nigh: Lipa launched her tour earlier this month in Miami and will stop next week at Capital One Arena. Further fanning excitement early reviews of the tour suggest it more than lives up to expectations and was also well worth the wait.

As the Rolling Stone summed up the Miami stop: “It may have taken a couple extra years to bring Future Nostalgia to the stage but she used that time to hone her powers and return as an even stronger certified pop diva.” With Lolo Zouai and Caroline Polachek as opening acts. Wednesday March 2 at 7:30 p.m. Capital One Arena 601 F St. NW. Remaining tickets both original and “Verified Resale” are $125 to $625 plus taxes and fees. Call 202-628-3200 or visit www.capitalonearena.com.

AIROTIC

Roughly six years ago Atlantis Events tapped aerial artists and acrobats Stephane Haffner and his husband Kyle Kier to develop a full-length LGBTQ-focused production for the popular gay cruise line. Since then the married duo has formed a troupe featuring more than a dozen artists in peak physical form performing what they refer to as a “sexy and sensual circus-style show” — all while wearing tight and skimpy costumes that show off their chiseled bodies courtesy of Haffner a skilled Paris-trained designer.

AirOtic has become a leading draw not only on Atlantis cruises but also at gay resorts including Provincetown Palm Springs and Ft. Lauderdale as well as Chicago and Los Angeles. And this weekend the troupe will make its debut in D.C. with shows in Park View’s dramatically high-ceilinged Hook Hall.

The hour-long production loosely relates a “story of love passion sexuality and eroticism” as told through a mix of choreography circus artistry aerial stunts burlesque and cabaret. Given all that you won’t be surprised to hear of high demand for tickets.

If you want to catch the show try to plan ahead and reserve tickets at least a week or more in advance — and booking is currently available for all shows in Hook Hall during the three-month engagement running through May 13. Multiple performances each weekend. Hook Hall is at 3400 Georgia Ave. NW. Tickets are $45 to $80 each or $95 per person for a four-seat Super VIP Couch. Call 202-629-4339 or visit www.hookhall.com or www.AirOticShow.com.

BLUE DOOR

In recent years noted playwright Tanya Barfield has dabbled in screenwriting for television — garnering a Writers Guild of America Award for her work on FX’s drama series The Americans and an Emmy nomination for writing on the acclaimed miniseries Mrs. America. Yet Barfield is still very much rooted in the theater. She serves as co-director of the playwriting program at Juilliard and it was only six years ago when the self-identified “biracial gay woman” won a Lambda Literary Award for her Off Broadway play Bright Half Life which focused on the romantic relationship between two lesbian characters.

A decade earlier is when the buzz about Barfield really started when her play Blue Door prompted favorable comparisons to the work of August Wilson for exploring similar themes about race and racism just on a more intimate and personal scale. Maryland’s Perisphere Theater has revived the play with original songs in a production directed and designed by Henery Wyand and starring DeJeanette Horne as the central character Lewis with Jaucqir LaFond portraying various ghosts from Lewis’s great grandfather to his brother.

A successful mathematics professor Lewis is failing in his private life with the wife who just left him accusing him of trying to ignore his Black identity and his ancestral history with slavery and racism. Cue visits from those family apparitions who force him to reckon with all that and the way that history has in fact impacted and shaped him.

For an even deeper dive into the subject Perisphere has invited two local professors of African-American history to lead discussions after the Sunday matinee performances with Dr. Quincy Mills of the University of Maryland College Park on hand this Sunday Feb. 27 and Dr. Sylvea Hollis of Montgomery College speaking on March 6. Runs through March 12. Silver Spring Black Box Theatre 8641 Colesville Road Silver Spring. Tickets are $24 to $34. Call 301-588-8270 or visit www.perispheretheater.com.

THE LUXURY OF CLAY: PORCELAIN PAST AND PRESENT

Invented in China in the 7th Century porcelain didn’t become an international commodity until roughly a thousand years later after Portuguese and Dutch merchants first created European demand for the beautiful polished kiln-fired ceramic goods and even more so once potters in Germany and France began producing “true porcelain” goods rivaling the Chinese exports.

The latest special exhibition at Hillwood offers a chronological overview shedding light on the history of the material sometimes referred to as “white gold” given its natural color and high value — with an emphasis on its role in helping shape the luxury goods market and its lasting impact on the art world chiefly by igniting centuries of innovation and creativity. Hillwood founder Marjorie Merriweather Post started her extensive porcelain collection a century ago and in the ensuing decades established herself as a discerning connoisseur of the craft displaying her treasures in special cases and designated rooms for French and Russian variations.

Curated by Hillwood’s Rebecca Tilles The Luxury of Clay features more than 140 porcelain objects — ranging from functional pieces and tableware to fine art and decorative sculptures and including vases teapots dishes and figurines. The bulk of these are prized even rare 18th-century pieces from innovative European factories — Meissen Sèvres Du Paquier and the Imperial Porcelain Factory (KPM) — mostly drawn from the museum’s permanent collection but also featuring loans from the National Museum of American History the Frick Collection and other private reserves.

The exhibition is rounded out with contemporary examples and interpretations including beautiful works of art by artists Bouke de Vries and Cindy Sherman displayed in the dacha on the grounds of the estate plus special Hillwood commissions of artists Chris Antemann — who created two Hillwood-inspired porcelain surtouts de table gracing the mansion’s dining and breakfast rooms — and Roberto Lugo whose new works incorporating themes from pop culture politics and social justice are interspersed throughout the mansion’s first floor.

On view to June 26. Hillwood Estate 4155 Linnean Ave. NW. Tickets are $15 to $18 for adults with discounts available for students children and everyone visiting on weekdays. Call 202-686-5807 or visit www.HillwoodMuseum.org.

BONOBO

Born in England as Simon Green nearly 46 years ago the artist known as Bonobo has been transfixing anyone who gives his brand of downtempo electronica an honest focused listen for two decades now — and the more you listen the more it’ll move you.

Last month Bonobo released his latest album Fragments whose title references how the project started putting together instrumental bits and pieces of ideas and experiments he created in his Los Angeles studio during the pandemic. The end result is far greater than the sum of those parts. As a review in the British magazine NME put it the album is “his most engaging in a decade: soothing energetic and just right for the current moment.” Bonobo will render Fragments live with a full band on tour including a stop at the 9:30 Club next week which should be particularly engaging on account of the collaborators featured on half of the 12 tracks including Jamila Woods on “Tides” Joji on “From You” and Kadhja Bonet on “Day By Day.”

The real standout though features a longtime collaborator and recurring touring partner of Bonobo’s Jordan Rakei who lends his buttery-smooth and captivating R&B-styled vocals to the dreamy and chill vibe of “Shadows.” Rakei the London-based vocalist and multi-instrumentalist originally from New Zealand first sparked international interest as the featured vocalist on Disclosure’s “Masterpiece” from 2015.

Since then the slightly experimental and ethereal soul- and hip-hop-influenced artist has won high praise from the likes of Elton John and Common who Rakei featured on “Signs” from 2019’s Origin. In 2022 he’s teamed back up with Bonobo for a tour in support of last year’s What We Call Life which he calls his “most vulnerable and intimate album to date.” Rakei will open for Bonobo on Thursday March 3. Doors at 7 p.m. 815 V St. NW. Tickets are $37.50. Call 202-265-0930 or visit www.930.com.

SEAN STEPHENS: REDEMPTION OF A ’90S KID

Last summer the all-male and frequently all-nude Camp Morning Wood: A Very Naked Musical was one of the first shows up and running with live in-person performances in New York since the pandemic. The hit Off Broadway show was unsurprisingly an easy sell with ticket-buying spectators but had a much harder time finding the right actors and mix of body types to bare all.

Sean Stephens was among those who did grin and bare it portraying Kincaid “the Britney-inspired gay sugar baby wannabe” in both the original 2019 production as well as the 2021 revival. In the end Stephens was rewarded for stepping up earning a BroadwayWorld nomination as Best Actor in an Off Broadway Musical.

Now after years of performing in occasional group cabarets at Feinstein’s/54 Below — including 54 Sings Kesha The Howard Ashman Celebration and An Evening with Dolly Parton — Stephens is preparing to make his New York solo show debut at Manhattan’s leading cabaret venue. He will premiere an original cabaret he’s calling Redemption of a ’90s Kid.

“Travel to summer 1997 crack open a Surge and take a journey of loss and discovery with the songs Sean typically belts out in his own home” reads the official synopsis. Those songs include vulnerable numbers from Reba McEntire Annie Lennox Hedwig and the Angry Inch “and a full out A Goofy Movie showstopper.”

Robbie Rozelle directs the cabaret with featured vocalist/performers Marti Gould Cummings Sean Doherty Walter Graham and Emerson Steele. Music direction by Mason Griffin with accompaniment by Ashley Baier on drums Najee Gabay and Beda Spindola. Thursday March 3 at 9:45 p.m. 254 W. 54th St. New York NY. Cover charge is $25 to $35 plus a food and beverage minimum of $25. Call 646-476-3551 or visit www.54Below.com.

THE HENRI

It’s a rather unusual name and a rather unusual restaurant concept in D.C. one that has the potential to be a rather unusual dining experience all around. Actually Executive Chef/Owner Frederick De Pue intends The Henri to be “a unique experience for everyone as the possibilities are endless.”

Previously known for D.C. restaurants including Table in Shaw and Menu MBK in Penn Quarter the native of Belgium who got his start in D.C. as an Embassy Row chef has focused much of his time in recent years on running his own catering business as well as overseeing the bistro Flamant in Annapolis — with any spare time devoted to planning for his ambitious return with The Henri. At first blush when viewed from the street the venue looks like the stylish inviting modern bistro that it partially is featuring a 60-seat dining room with an open floor plan and a central kitchen whose star appliance is a high-end French Bonnet rotisserie along with a sizable bar area with high-top seating and room for more than 50.

However that’s only half the story of the new two-concepts-in-one business. Further back past that public-facing restaurant there’s a culinary-focused event space only accessible via host and private entrance. This interior half of the 8000-square-foot establishment is a sleek warren of modular private dining rooms which can be combined to accommodate gatherings of four to 80 guests all of them surrounding a separate central kitchen bar and butcher block allowing for completely custom food and beverage menus and furnished with insulated acoustics and full A/V systems to make everything as private as possible.

The culinary attractions at the establishment situated down the block from the National Theatre prominently include the rotating daily specials from the Bonnet rotisserie both meats (such as half-chicken lamb T-bones and venison sausages) and vegetables. Other main course options include Butter Poached Atlantic Cod Wild Boar Lasagna and Coq Au Vin-Inspired Root Vegetables Braised in Red Wine. Notable starters include Cappuccino-Style Mushroom Soup Prawns (whether flambéed or broiled) and Belgian-style fries. The Henri is at 1301 Pennsylvania Ave. NW.

The chef who’s based in Washington D.C. has set up mobile kitchens in the Ukraine-Poland border providing meals for people fleeing the Russian invasion.

Jose Andres has been vocal about what’s going on in Ukraine and how he feels about it. He shared a video on Instagram where he clarified his stance and denounced the actions of the Russian government. “People of the World…Like you I am distraught watching Ukraine under attack. We must come together as a force for good! @WCKitchen is on the Ukraine-Poland border delivering meals tonight—Romania soon. In addition to your donations…I am committing support from the Bezos award to Ukraine” he captioned the post.

In the video he explained that he would be taking about 5 million dollars from the Bezos award he received and committing it to helping out the people in Ukraine.

Jose Andres was one of the recipients of Bezos Award winning $100 million dollars for his humanitarian efforts with World Central Kitchen a nonprofit that delivers food relief to areas that need most whether they were affected by a natural disaster or are facing a humanitarian crisis. Bezos’ award helped the organization have a wider reach and help out more people in eed.

In the wake of COVID-19 World Central Kitchen has been very active partnering up with restaurants farmers and community leaders to battle food insecurity and provide help to local businesses."

Talking about hurt loss and even mental health challenges is for lack of a better word popular right now and I do not have a problem with that.

What does bother me though is when issues of real pain are portrayed on screen in a way that just does not seem… real. What I mean by this is that it seems like many shows are willing to boast a script that uses the word “depression” but very few are bold enough to show a character experiencing depression – really truly experiencing its effects in all the ways a real person does.

Enter “BoJack Horseman”: A show that is willing to take a painfully realistic look at hurt.

A little background: “BoJack Horseman” is set in a cartoon world where animals and humans live alongside each other as do some animal-human hybrids. One of which is the star of the show and its namesake: BoJack Horseman. As his name suggests he is half-horse half-man. But that is far from the most interesting thing about BoJack. The show begins with him being already middle-aged. Once an extremely successful TV star he now lives a lavish and wealthy lifestyle surrounded by many acquaintances but few friends and doing nothing that has any real purpose.

While his formerly-famous status shields him from many of the external discomforts of the world he has to deal with internal pain just like the rest of us. And it is this that I think makes the show so profound and what made it stand out to me when I first watched it.

Throughout the show we witness BoJack deal with storylines that are so realistic they become at times almost too relatable. It makes me feel uncomfortable but in a good way. As though what I am seeing is familiar and the characters are people I have talked to before. It makes me want to somehow enter their world and join the conversation because I know the exact pain they are talking about and I have asked the exact questions they are asking.

If you are anything like me you will start out seeing BoJack almost as a sort of villain. He is self-centered does not treat his friends the way he should and never takes responsibility for his actions; you will probably find yourself really disliking him for those traits.

But as you progress through the episodes something horrifying will begin to happen. At least it will if you are anything like me. You will start to see yourself in BoJack. You will realize the reason he puts you on edge is that he is struggling through the obstacles in his life in the exact ways you are struggling through the obstacles in yours. But weirdly enough there is something so comforting about coming to that horrifying realization.

I think what bothers me about how most shows and movies portray mental health is how oversimplified it is. It usually goes like this:

A character has a mental struggle. They experience something that “changes their perspective.” The struggle goes away.

And while that would be an amazing way for life to go the truth is that it usually just does not go like that and BoJack Horseman does not try to uphold any pretenses that it does.

One of my favorite scenes of the entire series shows BoJack sitting and talking with his close friend Diane on the balcony of his house in LA. The scene comes directly on the heels of BoJack messing up and alienating himself from his friends then realizing how much he needs them. This is a pattern that is repeated often in the show. BoJack asks Diane if she thinks he is a good person. When she does not immediately answer the way he was hoping she would he starts to beg.

“I need you to tell me that I’m a good person” he says. “I know that I can be selfish and narcissistic and self-destructive but underneath all that deep down I’m a good person and I need you to tell me that I’m good. Diane? Tell me please Diane. Tell me that I’m good.”

She does not answer. No matter how bad he wants her to she does not answer. As his question hangs in the air wanting desperately to be answered we are left trying to answer it for ourselves.

Truth be told that scene was nothing short of inspiring to me. Not because Diane did not answer his question but because of what he was asking in the first place. Underneath all of his pain and baggage he holds onto a sliver of hope. Hope that he is not destined to be bad. Hope that deep down he is actually good. The desperation in his voice when he says those hopes out loud is gripping. Gripping because it is a hope I hold onto as well.

Though BoJack Horseman shows pain in a surprisingly up close and personal fashion the show is far from being a downer. In fact I leave most episodes feeling strangely uplifted. I am still not sure the reason for this but I have a theory. I think it is because of the off-brand hope that runs underneath every episode of every season. A hope that is summed up best in a line from the show: “Every day it gets a little easier. But you’ve got to do it every day. That’s the hard part.”

“BoJack Horseman” depicts a world without the nuances edited out. A world where relationships are not black and white pain is not simple and growth is not linear; rather it is a long walk and the times you trip will not ruin you so long as you keep walking.

BoJack Horseman is available to stream on Netflix.

Taken together the settlements are the largest to date among the many opioid-related cases that have been playing out across the country. They’re expected to provide a significant boost to efforts aimed at reversing the crisis in places that have been devastated by it including many parts of rural America.

Johnson & Johnson AmerisourceBergen Cardinal Health and McKesson announced the settlement plan last year but the deal was contingent on getting participation from a critical mass of state and local governments.

Friday was the deadline for the companies to announce whether they felt enough governments had committed to participate in the settlement and relinquish the right to sue. The four companies notified lawyers for the governments in the case that their thresholds were met meaning money could start flowing to communities by April.

“We’re never going to have enough money to immediately cure this problem” said Joe Rice one of the lead lawyers who represented local governments in the litigation that led to the settlement. “What we’re trying to do is give a lot of small communities a chance to try to change some of their problems.”

THE NEED FOR FUNDING RUNS DEEP

While none of the settlement money will go directly to victims of opioid addiction or their survivors the vast majority of it is required to be used to deal with the epidemic. The need for the funding runs deep.

Kathleen Noonan CEO of the Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers said a portion of the settlement money should be used to provide housing to people with addictions who are homeless.

“We have clients who have a hard time staying clean to make it in a shelter” she said. “We would like to stabilise them so we can help them recover.”

Dan Keashen a spokesman for Camden County government said officials are thinking about using settlement money for a public education campaign to warn about the dangers of fentanyl. They also want to send more drug counsellors into the streets put additional social workers in municipal courts and pay for anti-addiction medications in the county jail.

Officials across the country are considering pumping the money into similar priorities.

California Governor Gavin Newsom’s proposed budget calls for using US$50 million of the state’s expected US$86 million share this year for youth opioid education and to train treatment providers improve data collection and distribute naloxone a drug that reverses overdoses.

In Florida’s Broward County home to Fort Lauderdale the number of beds in a county-run detoxification facility could be expanded from 50 to 70 or 75 said Danielle Wang French a lawyer for the county.

“It’s not enough but it’s a good start” she said of the settlement.

With fatal overdoses continuing to rage across the US largely because of the spread of fentanyl and other illicitly produced synthetic opioids public health experts are urging governments to use the money to ensure access to drug treatment for people with addictions. They also emphasise the need to fund programmes that are proven to work collect data on their efforts and launch prevention efforts aimed at young people all while focusing on racial equity.

“It shouldn’t be: ready set spend” said Joshua Sharfstein a former secretary of the Maryland Department of Health who is now a vice-dean of public health at Johns Hopkins University. “It should be: think strategise spend.”

In a separate deal that also is included in the US$26 billion the four companies reached a US$590-million settlement with the nation’s federally recognised Native American tribes. About US$2 billion is being set aside for fees and expenses for the lawyers who have spent years working on the case.

New Brunswick New Jersey-based Johnson & Johnson has nine years to pay its US$5-billion share. The distributors – Conshohocken Pennsylvania-based AmerisourceBergen; Columbus Ohio-based Cardinal Health; and Irving Texas-based McKesson –agreed to pay their combined US$21 billion over 18 years. To reach the maximum amounts states have to get local governments to sign on.

The settlements go beyond money. J&J which has stopped selling prescription opioids agrees not to resume. The distributors agree to send data to a clearinghouse intended to help flag when prescription drugs are diverted to the black market.

The companies are not admitting wrongdoing and are continuing to defend themselves against claims that they helped cause the opioid crisis that were brought by entities that are not involved in the settlements.

In a joint statement the distributors called the implementation of the settlement “a key milestone towards achieving broad resolution of governmental opioid claims and delivering meaningful relief to communities across the United States”.

The requirement that most of the money be used to address the opioid crisis contrasts with a series of public health settlements in the 1990s with tobacco companies. In those cases states used big chunks of the settlement money to fill budget gaps and fund other priorities.

The amount sent to each state under the opioid settlement depends on a formula that takes into account the severity of the crisis and the population. County and local governments also get shares of the money. A handful of states – Alabama New Hampshire Oklahoma Washington and West Virginia – have not joined all or part of the settlement mostly because they have their own deals or are preparing for trial.

In Camden Lisa Davey a recovery specialist for Maryville Addiction Treatment Center was at a needle exchange this week handing out naloxone a drug that reverses overdoses and asking people if they wanted to start treatment.

DETOXIFICATION AND TREATMENT PROGRAMMES

Davey said she wants to see detoxification and treatment programmes receive more funding to keep people in them for longer. As it is she said users can detox and be back out on the streets in search of drugs within days.

“They need more time to work their recovery” she said.

A man picking up clean needles who asked to be identified only as Anthony P said he was 46 and had struggled with addiction since he was a teenager. He said he’d like to see an effort to cut off fentanyl and related synthetic opioids that are driving overdose death rates from the drug supply.

“Fentanyl’s got to go” he said.

Martha Chavis president and CEO of Camden Area Health Education Center which runs the needle exchange said one need is offering services like hers in more places. Now users from far-flung suburbs travel into Camden to get clean needles and kits to test their drugs for fentanyl.

The settlement with J&J and the three distributors marks a major step towards resolving the vast constellation of lawsuits in the US over liability for an epidemic that has been linked to the deaths of more than 500000 Americans over the past two decades.

Other companies including business consultant McKinsey and drugmakers Endo Mallinckrodt and Teva have reached national settlements or a series of local ones. OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and a group of states are in mediation through US bankruptcy court to try to reach a nationwide settlement.

The crisis has deepened during the coronavirus pandemic with US opioid-related deaths reaching a high of more than 76000 in the 12 months that ended in April 2021 largely because of the spread of fentanyl and other lab-made drugs. A recent report from a commission by The Lancet medical journal projected that 1.2 million Americans could die of opioid overdose between 2020 and 2029 without policy changes.

John F. Kelly a professor of psychiatry in addiction medicine at Harvard Medical School said he wants to see money from the settlements go not just for treatment recovery and support efforts but also to build systems designed to prevent this sort of epidemic from happening again.

“Some kind of national board or organisation could be set up ... to prevent this kind of lack of oversight from happening again – where industry is allowed to create a public health hazard” he said.

The cruise industry has been among the hardest hit during the COVID-19 pandemic virtually shutting down to prevent passengers from getting sick. Cruise line company Carnival (CCL 1.11%) has resumed operations but the stock remains well below its pre-COVID share price.

If you're wondering whether Carnival can reclaim its pre-COVID highs anytime soon or whether the stock is a promising long-term investment there are some things you need to know. Here are three observations about Carnival that could concern investors.

1. Robbing the future to stay alive

Carnival did what it had to during the COVID-19 pandemic which dealt it a pretty rough hand. Carnival operates expensive cruise ships that require supplies fuel and crew to service guests. The ships need to run near full capacity and profitability plummets if they aren't.

The company did what it could to cut costs but the reality is that Carnival had to raise a lot of money to survive COVID-19. It did this both with debt and by issuing new shares of stock to raise money. You can see in the chart below how debt has climbed from roughly $12 billion just before the pandemic to more than $33 billion today. Additionally the number of outstanding shares has increased to 1.1 billion.

These actions were necessary but came with a cost to investors. Carnival's increased debt will result in higher interest expenses which will eat away at Carnival's net income -- its bottom-line profits.

Meanwhile issuing new shares makes the existing shares worth less by decreasing Carnival's per-share metrics like earnings per share. The dramatic increase in both debt and shares is likely to negatively impact the stock's investment returns.

2. The stock's valuation has already recovered

The stock's heavy debt and additional shares have skewed the stock's valuation creating an illusion that the stock is cheaper than before the pandemic. While that's true from a share-price perspective investors should consider its valuation through enterprise value which is a company's market cap plus its net debt. In other words what is the market price of a company if you were looking to buy the whole thing?

You can see in the chart below that Carnival's enterprise value was approximately $48 billion in January 2020. The company had fewer shares trading at a higher price and less debt. But now the additional shares and debt have bloated the stock's valuation offsetting the declines in the share price.

For the company's share price to continue increasing from here its enterprise value would need to grow beyond its pre-COVID level. That could be tough to justify in the near term because of the uncertain operating environment Carnival currently faces moving forward.

3. The bleeding might not be over yet

The pandemic could soon fade as more people become vaccinated worldwide and Carnival might begin seeing demand come back for cruises. It plans to resume use of all 10 of its year-round U.S. ports by March and have its entire fleet sailing by May.

Investors will want to see how full these cruises are. Resuming full operations will likely ramp up operating costs in 2022. The company spent $12.9 billion in operating expenses in 2019 the last full year before the pandemic. Its 2021 operating costs were just $4.6 billion but Carnival generated just $1 billion in revenue compared to $14 billion in 2019.

It could be a worst-case scenario if Carnival sails a bunch of half-empty ships spending all this money on its fleet but not generating enough revenue. Carnival currently has a solid cash buffer built up of $8.9 billion but could be forced to raise more funds if it blows through that.

Investor takeaway

Nobody knows what a stock will do in the short term so perhaps Carnival will trade higher if the company gets some good news like solid booking numbers. But fundamentals tend to drive the share price higher or lower over the long term and it's currently tough to see a situation where Carnival shares go very far without the company improving its balance sheet significantly.

Unfortunately a lot of Carnival's potential post-pandemic rebound has already priced into the stock; many investors just don't realize it yet. I think it's likely that Carnival's business survives the pandemic and gets back on its feet eventually. But as far as the stock goes investors may be better off setting sail without Carnival in their long-term portfolio.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vY2FsYS5jb20vcGljdHVyZS1nYWxsZXJ5L25ld3MvMjAyMi8wMi8yNi9tYXJpb24tY291bnR5LWZhaW1hcmlvbi1jb3VudHktZmFpci13aW50ZXItY2Fybml2YWxyLXdpbnRlci1jYXJuaXZhbC82OTUxODkzMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marion County Fair Winter Carnival,"NEWS

This week: LGT Transport expands in Texas; Fintech firm raises $16M for cross-border trade; Transfar Shipping launches China-US Gulf Coast container service; and El Paso Logistics Park opens.

Nebraska-based tanker carrier expands in Texas to serve industrial refineries

LGT Transport recently expanded its facility in Baytown Texas to handle the growing volume of industrial gas clients in the U.S. Gulf Coast region.

The Baytown facility now also serves as LGT Transport’s Southern headquarters managing clients and services in North Carolina Tennessee Oklahoma and Texas.

Pam Spaccarotella founder and CEO of Omaha Nebraska-based LGT Transport said the growth in Texas has come from chemical and gas refinery customers.

“We still are focusing on the industrial gas industry and the refineries are large consumers of industrial gases” Spaccarotella told FreightWaves. “We have recently been expanding into anhydrous ammonia in the Gulf Coast region and we are also expanding into liquefied petroleum gas.”

LGT Transport also has five other locations in Nebraska Ohio Tennessee and California. Spaccarotella first opened a cryogenic manufacturing repair facility and truck terminal in Baytown in 2016.

“I had a trucking terminal and I also have this repair facility for cryogenic trailers and ISO containers that are used to transport ethylene in the liquefied natural gas space” Spaccarotella said. “We outgrew that space so in 2020 we bought 11 acres of land and we built our new facility in 2021.”





The Baytown terminal is now LGT Transport’s largest facility. It includes a 4100-square-foot office space and 20000-square-foot maintenance center. The expansion was completed in January.

About 75 to 100 trucks operate from the Baytown facility with a mix of company drivers and owner-operators. The expansion included driver amenities such as showers a laundry a break room for meal preparation and storage and a lounge and relaxation areas.

LGT has 178 trucks and 194 drivers according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.

Spaccarotella founded LGT Transport in 2012 after a career in the Air Force where she worked as a missile launch officer. She is a graduate of the Air Force Academy and also has a law degree and is a certified public accountant.

“When I became a CPA it was during that time in public accounting when I started working on transportation clients” Spaccarotella said. “My trucking career really started when I became the controller and chief financial officer for Cryogenic Transportation.”

Spaccarotella worked her way up to president and CEO of Cryogenic Transportation before striking out on her own to found LGT Transport.

Petroleum and liquid tankers could be the trucking segment with the biggest employment shortfall with an almost 42% reduction in qualified driver applicants since 2019 according to the National Tank Truck Carriers (NTTC) an industry trade group.

“The driver shortage has hit the specialized segment of petroleum drivers especially hard and the COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated the issue” NTTC said in a study released in August.





Spaccarotella said LGT Transport has been very fortunate in finding drivers.

“We have excellent drivers and we do not tend to have either the turnover or the difficulty in recruiting that most trucking companies have” Spaccarotella said.

LGT Transport’s biggest challenge right now isn’t finding drivers but getting new tanker trucks.

“It’s very difficult to get trucks these days; the major truck makers are way behind on manufacturing this year” Spaccarotella said. “All the trucks that we’re supposed to take delivery on in February have been pushed back to July.”

Fintech firm raises $16M to grow cross-border trade

New York-based startup Mundi recently announced it has raised $16 million in a series A round according to TechCrunch.

The funding round was led by Union Square Ventures and included Upper90 FJ Labs Base10 Partners Exor N.V. Andbank AlleyCorp Operator Partners and Gilgamesh Ventures as well as Brex C2FO Bluevine and Wisetack.

“We are very proud of what we have accomplished in our first two years. Our mission will continue to help more Mexican businesses expand their business internationally” Mundi officials said in a statement.

Mundi was founded in 2020 by Martin Pustilnick. The company previously raised $7.8 million in a seed round led by Base10 and FJ Labs.

Mundi is a digital factoring financial platform aimed at Mexico-based freight forwarders exporting goods to the U.S. The company uses nonrecourse factoring solutions to provide financial services to transportation and logistics companies.

Transfar Shipping launches China-US East Coast container service

Singapore-based Transfar Shipping recently launched a China-U.S. East Coast service that includes two seaports in Texas.

Transfar Shipping will call the Chinese ports of Qingdao and Ningbo; and also includes stops in the Port of New York and New Jersey; Charleston South Carolina; as well as Port Houston and the Port of Freeport in South Texas.

Transfar Shipping’s China-U.S. East Coast service currently offers one to two direct sailings per month. The service which launched in December is Port Freeport’s first container vessel to offer all-water service from Asia.

“The current disruptions in the supply chain have encouraged carriers and shippers to consider alternate ports of entry Port Freeport has become an enticing alternative” Phyllis Saathoff CEO of Port Freeport said in a statement.

Transfar Shipping began operations as a freight forwarder in July and launched liner shipping services on China-U.S. West Coast sailings using chartered vessels in August.

Transfar is owned by Chinese 3PL Worldwide Logistics a subsidiary of Alibaba China’s largest e-commerce company.

El Paso Logistics Park opens signs 3 tenants

VanTrust Real Estate a commercial real estate developer recently completed the first phase of the El Paso Logistics Park in El Paso Texas.

Phase I consists of four industrial buildings totaling 514135 square feet on 59 acres. The park is a mile from Interstate 10 and 5 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border crossing at the Ysleta-Zaragoza International Bridge.

Kansas City Missouri-based VanTrust also announced three new tenants at the park including OLA Logistics LLC Interceramic Inc. and Buckland Global Trade Services Inc.

“These three leases are a great example of the industrial demand that El Paso the world’s largest border community is experiencing” Josh Meredith director of development at VanTrust said in a statement. “This is only the beginning of what is predicted to be a growing market in 2022.”

A fourth vessel sustained light damage though it is unclear how and when this was sustained.

A statement issued by the Ukrainian government on Sunday said that following the announcement of a “counter-terrorist operation” in the northwestern part of the Black Sea Russian navy vessels have captured two Ukrainian civilian vessels. The statement points out that this is in defiance with norms and convention of international law.

The statement identifies the first vessel as the Ukrainian flagged Athena who was reportedly sailing in Romanian waters when 22nm off Snake Island she received a command to approach a Russian warship for inspection. The shipowner of the Athena immediately informed all the competent authorities in Ukraine.

Another ship is believed to have been detained after a sharp and illogical change of course was recorded. The Ukrainian flagged Princess Nicole’s AIS data was also showing a course towards Snake Island.

When both civilian vessels approached the Russian warships their AIS were turned off and communication stopped. This morning AIS data indicated that they are now staying 18nm off the coast of Crimea.

The statement condemned the incident for an act of piracy under the guise of a self-proclaimed counter-terrorist operation. The statement continues that the vessels have 50 civilians on board as well as thousands of tons of diesel fuel and grain.

The two vessels referred to in the statement are identified as the Ukrainian-flagged Bulk Carrier PRINCESS NICOLE (IMO 8319392) and Bulk Carrier AFINA (IMO 8029272). Both vessels were drifting 58NM NW Sevastopol (Crimea Peninsula) at 07:47UTC and 08:19UTC on Sunday respectively.

AIS data also shows 7 vessels including the PRINCESS NICOLE and AFINA being stopped in proximity to Snake Island around 04:26UTC on Saturday. All vessels u-turned between 09:00UTC and 11:35UTC. The PRINCESS NICOLE and AFINA halted at the same location between 12:00UTC and 13:00UTC after u-turning and both stopped transmitting around 13:20 UTC. Footage appears to show one of the other 5 vessels that was halted on Saturday the Panama flagged Bulk carrier LORD NELSON (IMO 9296315) on Sunday passing the Bosporus strait with light damage on the vessel hull. It is unclear how this damage was sustained and whether this was sustained at the same time that the PRINCESS NICOLE and AFINA were reportedly detained by the Russian Navy.

Additionally the Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority has reported that they lost communication with tug vessel SAPFIRE (IMO 9728351) also when operating in proximity to Snake Island. AIS data shows the vessel operating in close proximity to Russian held Snake Island as well as the PRINCESS NICOLE the AFINA and the LORD NELSON.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlZGdsb2JhbC5jb20vc2hpcHBpbmctc2hpcGJ1aWxkaW5nL25ld3NWaWV3L2tlZDIwMjIwMjI3MDAwMtIBMWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmtlZGdsb2JhbC5jb20vbmV3c0FtcC9rZWQyMDIyMDIyNzAwMDI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hyundai Glovis aims to top global car transport market,"Hyundai Glovis secures an exclusive shipping space in Bremerhaven a port city on Germany’s North Sea coast (Courtesy of Hyundai Glovis)

Hyundai Glovis Co. the world’s second-largest car shipping company aims to top the industry with an expansion of its fleet specializing in electric vehicle transportation services with exclusive docks in major ports worldwide.Hyundai Motor Group’s logistics unit has maintained the No. 2 position for a third straight year in 2021 following Japan’s Nippon Yusen KK (NYK).Hyundai Glovis operated 95 vessels to transport vehicles last year up from 54 ships in 2016 according to industry sources on Sunday. NYK was the only company that has more carriers than Hyundai Glovis with 105 ships. Japan’s Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL) and Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. (K-Line) ran 85 vessels and 75 carriers respectively while Europe’s EUKOR Car Carriers managed 71 ships.The South Korean shipping company has been steadily raising its fleet on growing demand from global automakers. It increased the number of car carriers last year from 86 in 2020 even as the global automotive chip shortage disrupted car production worldwide.Hyundai Glovis plans to add seven more vessels by building new ones as well as long-term charters although Japanese competitors don’t have such expansion plans due to the ongoing pandemic. That is expected to keep shipping fares high until 2023 sources said.The car shipping company has signed its largest deals in 10 years -- excluding its affiliates Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Corp -- with five carmakers for 2022. Those clients consist of two European automakers a US company an Asian maker and a global player. The contracts with the two European companies and the US automaker expire in 2024.In 2016 Hyundai Glovis transported cars for only one Asian maker.“If the current trend continues Hyundai Glovis is expected to aim for the No. 1 spot within a few years” said an industry source in South Korea.Hyundai Glovis generated 61% of its total sales last year from automakers not part of Hyundai Motor Group.

Two Carrier AquaSnap® 30RBP air-cooled chillers with Greenspeed® Intelligence inverter-driven speed control are providing high-performance low noise cooling for wards and operating theatres at Royal United Hospitals Bath.

The high-efficiency chillers are running on lower global warming potential (GWP) refrigerant R-32 as part of a major upgrade of the hospital's air conditioning system. Refrigerant R-32 is up to 10% more efficient than R-410A the refrigerant it replaces and its global warming potential is 68% lower. Carrier is part of Carrier Global Corporation the leading global provider of healthy safe and sustainable and intelligent building and cold chain solutions.

The chillers mounted on a new roof-top platform replace two older split-system chillers by other manufacturers significantly reducing servicing requirements and related costs due to their compact fully packaged design. The selection also aligns with Carrier’s 2030 Environmental Social and Governance goalsto reduce its customers' carbon footprint by more than 1 gigaton.

Due to the combination of variable-speed electronically commutated condenser fans high-performance Novation®heat exchangers and compressors optimised for operation with R-32 the chillers have a very high seasonal energy efficiency rating (SEER) of 5.18. The N+N system design ensures a second unit is available to take over full cooling duties in the unlikely event of a failure providing the resilience required in this critical hospital application.

'Key requirements for the project were excellent efficiency reliability resilience low sound levels and reduced environmental impact and the Carrier chillers and system design deliver this' said James Allard Director of Brunel Integrated Services consultant on the project.

'Carrier provided excellent support throughout the project. There was an issue with the hospital's electrical supply which was limited and couldn't be upgraded in time for the start-up of the new chillers. Carrier responded quickly and programmed a load limit into the chiller control system to ensure they would not draw more than the maximum allowed protecting the hospital's electrical system while ensuring cooling needs were fully met.”

The chillers went into service while work continued to upgrade the electrical supply. The chillers were also equipped with soft-start electronics which provided a further safeguard to peak electrical load.

Additional options specified included enhanced acoustic attenuation to further reduce noise given the sensitive hospital application and Enviroshield®condenser coil protection with a three-year warranty.

'Although the National Health Service was Carrier's direct customer on the project Carrier provided excellent support to the installer Intoheat Ltd and worked closely with them to support the project to completion” noted James Allard.

Based on the positive experience on the project Brunel Integrated Services recommended a similar Carrier solution for a replacement project at another hospital located in the West of England.

As a new member of the Long March carrier rocket family the development of the Long March-8 aims to fill this gap and the rocket model will be tasked with meeting surging demand for launch services from commercial satellite companies at home and abroad.The Long March-8 took its maiden flight in December 2020 also from the Wenchang spaceport.Compared with the Long March-8 Y1 rocket the Y2 rocket for the Sunday mission has cancelled the two boosters and the two-and-half stages design has now turned into a two-stage. The height of its nose cone has also shortened to 5.4 meters from eight meters the CALT explained. This change has broadened the launch window for the commercial mission.Duan Baocheng a deputy commander-in-chief for Long March-8 said the rocket will perform 12 separation maneuvers to send the 22 satellites to their preset orbits noting it's just like performing a ""space ballet.""According to designers they spent half a year in developing a three-layered distributer inside the nose cone to ensure the safety of the satellite-rocket separations. The distributer helps allocate suitable seats for each satellite passenger.Li Jinglin the orbit designer for the Long March-8 told the Global Times on Sunday that the speed direction and order of the separations are key factors to determine the satellites' trajectory after the separation.It was quite a challenge for designers to figure out such key factors for each passenger. The orbit designer team also conducted long-term simulation observation and examination to make sure there would be no collision or any interference between any of the spacecraft Li explained.A constant change of flight mode of the rocket final stage made that happen Li said.The model has been dubbed the ""Chinese version of SpaceX Falcon 9"" for its potential to be reusable. The first stage of Long March-8 is expected to become reusable 10 times by 2025 and by 2035 the entire rocket is expected to be reusable the CASC said in November 2020.The Sunday mission of Long March-8 was the first commercial launch in the Wenchang spaceport the Global Times learned from sources with the facility. The commercial launch marks a major advancement toward building a world-class space launch center.In the long run the Long March-8 will also be extremely smart said the CASC. It will be able to adjust its flight status automatically if it encounters a malfunction greatly improving the mission results.Wu Yansheng a senior official with the CASC revealed in November that China aims to develop the first launch vehicle capable of vertical take-off and vertical landing by 2025."

A forest pest that bedevils Maine residents and tourists with hairs that cause an itchy rash appears to be spreading due to warming temperatures a group of scientists has found.

The browntail moth is a scourge in America's most forested state where it defoliates trees and causes a rash in humans that resembles poison ivy. The hairs of the caterpillars which have been the subject of an outbreak in the state for about seven years can also cause respiratory trouble.

The growth and spread of the moth is tied to increasingly warm weather especially in the fall the scientists wrote recently in the journal Environmental Entomology. And unfortunately climate trends suggest upcoming years could be even worse they wrote.

Warmer fall temperatures are especially beneficial to the pesky bugs because that allows them to get fatter before they hibernate for the winter said Eleanor Groden professor emerita of entomology at University of Maine and the principal investigator on the study.

""If they come out of those webs as hearty individuals older individuals maturity wise then they are better able to withstand that period and you get higher populations"" Groden said. ""And you get defoliation that spring and populations are raising havoc for anyone who has them in their yards.""

The browntail moth is native to Europe and neighboring countries in Asia and Africa. It was accidentally introduced in Massachusetts in the late 19th century and is now found in coastal Maine and Cape Cod Massachusetts. The caterpillars become active from April to June and have been identified as ""an insect of both forest and human health concern"" by the Maine Department of Health and Human Services.

The population of the moths has ebbed and flowed in the decades since it first arrived in Maine in 1904. But the outbreak has been steadily worsening in Maine in recent years and entomologists said last year was the worst year for browntail moth infestations in state history. The bugs have been growing in both number and territory as the Maine Forest Service said they've spread into northern and western areas of the state in the last two years.

The study found early fall temperatures are a key determinant of population levels the following year and that climate trends ""indicate continued increases in fall temperatures"" since the moth's resurgence in the state.

It's another example of how climate change can aggravate pest problems and jeopardize human health said David Wagner a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Connecticut who was not involved in the study. Climate change has already exacerbated problems with disease-causing pests such as mosquitoes and ticks he said.

""Climate change appears to be an important driver in this system"" Wagner said. ""So this outbreak can continue to increase and it could come at great expense to land owners and great nuisance for landowners.""

Maine communities have tried numerous strategies to try to slow the spread of the moth including informing residents about how to safely remove their nests. The Maine Legislature is considering creating a special grant fund to pay for mitigation measures.

They're a tough species to manage because they're spreading fast and not native to the ecosystem Groden said.

""What we are left with is how can we mitigate the localized problem in our yards and public spaces"" she said.

The Maine Department of Agriculture Conservation and Forestry declared February 2022 Browntail Moth Awareness Month encouraging residents of the nation’s most forest-covered state to destroy the autumn insect’s habitats as they lay dormant in the winter.

The moth defoliates trees and causes humans to break out in a rash that resembles poison ivy while the hairs of the moth’s caterpillars cause respiratory issues.

Rising temperatures especially in the fall are the reason for the moth’s growing nuisance said University of Maine professor Eleanor Groden the principal investigator of a new study published in the journal Environmental Entomology. Warmer weather allows the pests to grow fatter and healthier before hibernation.

“If they come out of those webs as hearty individuals older individuals maturity-wise then they are better able to withstand that period and you get higher populations” Groden said. “And you get defoliation that spring and populations are raising havoc for anyone who has them in their yards.”

“(Browntail moth) populations in Maine have been in an outbreak phase since 2015 and the pest cannot be eradicated” state officials warn.

“Winter is the best time to clip and destroy winter webs within reach or hire licensed arborists or pesticide applicators to reduce out-of-reach populations.”

She has to suit up at her family’s lakefront camp in Litchfield — duct-taping gloves and socks to minimize exposure and showering as soon as she returns indoors.

Donelson is concerned that their infested oak trees could die due to repeated BTM defoliation as trees have on nearby properties. Last winter a licensed pesticide applicator treated their oaks but it didn’t seem to help. She recalled: “I’ve never seen so many BTM caterpillars.”

This winter Donelson’s getting help from on high — from a drone carrying a robotic attachment with a rotating saw blade to sever branch tips with BTM webs. She is hiring arborist Eben Mann of Mann’s Lumber and Tree in Litchfield to use his newly acquired drone tool developed by DeLeaves a small company in Sherbrooke Quebec that designs drone-mounted branch-cutting equipment. The robotic attachment already used by numerous university researchers for forest sampling resulted from three years of design work and multiple field trials.

Mann is the first person in Maine to own this drone attachment which could — and should — become more widespread to reduce BTM impact without using pesticides that kill a broad spectrum of species.

Oaks one of the trees BTM prefers support more than 800 caterpillar species entomologist Douglas Tallamy writes and those insects in turn feed the young of countless bird species. In his view oak is the most essential native tree species.

BTM caterpillars an invasive insect from Europe are not eaten by Maine birds which is partly why the moth has overtaken 200000 acres. Climate change is likely hastening its spread because the state has had fewer cool damp springs that favor the growth of a fungal pathogen deadly to BTM caterpillars.

While drones can’t eliminate BTM these low-impact devices — powered by rechargeable batteries — hold promise to help protect high-value trees in critical locations around homes and businesses and in municipal parks.

To realize that promise more experts need to demonstrate the enterprising and collaborative spirit that helped ordinary citizens bring this technology to Maine. In a time of rampant ecological disruptions their story provides a powerful reminder that local initiative can give rise to valuable solutions.

‘Like a dog with a bone’

Recognizing the environmental harm of applying pesticides and cutting oaks in response to BTM Anita Brosius-Scott of Camden was on the lookout for a better fix. When she learned about forestry uses of drones in 2019 she recalled “I went after it like a dog with a bone.”

Brosius-Scott contacted experts at MIT and Cornell University about collaborating and reached out to Maine Forest Service staff and University of Maine researchers. She came to realize that “researchers work on very different time frames than anxious property owners.”

When Brosius-Scott learned of the DeLeaves’ forest-sampling tool she sent them background information and wrote: “We have a big problem. We need your help.” But a visit to Maine by their engineers was delayed when the border closed due to COVID. Only in December 2021 were they able to come show local residents how their device worked.

One person helping host their visit was Tom Massey of Rockland a licensed arborist and UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) pilot who runs Active Intelligence a drone mapping and photography company. He was game to learn more about the cutting device the second he heard of it.

Friends had already shared “a lot of weaponized ideas” about drone control for BTM from flame throwers to plastic BB pellets he recalled without realizing that it’s “highly illegal to weaponize drones.” He watched videos online of the DeLeaves tool in action but wasn’t sure it could work fast enough for an arborist to make it economical.

Using the drone-mounted robotic tool at the demonstration persuaded Massey that “in rapid succession you can effectively and efficiently remove an infestation in trees.” For an experienced drone pilot he added “the learning curve was almost nothing.”

The DJI Matrice 300 drone used in the demonstration has self-heating batteries that can work in the winter the ideal time for web removal. With the robotic tool in place it can operate for about 35 minutes before needing a fresh battery. Massey was convinced that it could be cost-competitive with mechanical clipping from bucket trucks.

The demonstration also persuaded Mann who also had heard about DeLeaves that it was time to get his drone’s license buy a drone and order a cutting tool.

“I’ve made plenty of leaps before” he said. “I’ll take a leap of faith and see what happens.” (Since notifying clients of his drone-clipping service Mann has received so much interest he may buy a second tool for an employee to use.)

The demonstration sparked creative thinking at DeLeaves incubated in Sherbrooke University about how to refine its tool to better address treetop caterpillar web removal. Maine it turns out isn’t the only place with a “big problem.” DeLeaves engineers will soon head to France where the pine processionary moth causes similar skin irritation and tongue necrosis in dogs.

Guillaume Charron the co-founder of DeLeaves said the hope is to find more partners like Mann in Maine to provide feedback on the tool’s use with BTM. “It’s all experimental at this stage; we are happy to collaborate” Charron said.

Adopting ‘disruptive’ technology

What’s not to like about an innovation that’s environmentally benign potentially cost-competitive and made by a small company eager to have its product help people?

A staff person at the Maine Forest Service described the drone innovation as “kind of a difficult topic” and said that neither federal nor state funds were likely available to help advance the technology.

A university expert said it would not be “commercially practical or feasible” adding: “I don’t see it being a cost-effective solution in the short or long term” and “it’s unlikely the (arborist) industry would adopt this.”

Several people signaled that this drone tool should be pursued only if private companies are willing to invest. But isn’t the role of government and land grant universities to support research and development helping early prototypes advance to a point where larger-scale production becomes economical and feasible?

There was no “dog with a bone” enthusiasm here.

But the director of Maine Technology Institute Brian Whitney expressed excitement and indicated that MTI could potentially lend support and collaborate with Maine-based businesses.

And Jarlath O’Neil-Dunne who directs the Spatial Analysis Laboratory at the University of Vermont and works with the USDA Forest Service on research saw this as a “huge” and “exciting” advance to help residential landowners.

Even if the capacity of drones is confined to “single-digit acres” he noted they’re a “disruptive technology” that opens up new ways of doing things and capacities that weren’t possible. They can go where bucket trucks can’t for example. They’re never a “saving technology” he said. “They are just one piece of the solution.”

For thousands of Maine residents like Sally Donelson that one piece could restore livability to settings they love and protect trees they treasure.

“We should commend the companies and individuals who are pushing the envelope” O’Neil-Dunne said. “Someone’s doing something neat and innovative. Let’s support that.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vZnJpZW5kcy1oaWxhcmlvdXMtY2hhbmRsZXItYmluZy1xdW90ZXMtcHJvdmUtaGVzLWZ1bm5pZXN0LWNoYXJhY3Rlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Friends: 10 Hilarious Chandler Quotes That Prove He Is The Funniest Character,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vc2NyZWVucmFudC5jb20vZnJpZW5kcy1oaWxhcmlvdXMtY2hhbmRsZXItYmluZy1xdW90ZXMtcHJvdmUtaGVzLWZ1bm5pZXN0LWNoYXJhY3Rlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vc3dhbnNlYWJheW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDIvMjcvbG9vay1vdXQtY29saW4tdGhlcmVzLWEtbmV3LW5vdmVsdHktY2FrZS1pbi10b3duLWFzZGFzLWdyZXRhLXRoZS1nbHV0ZW4tZnJlZS1ndWluZWEtcGlnL9IBggFodHRwczovL3N3YW5zZWFiYXluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAyLzI3L2xvb2stb3V0LWNvbGluLXRoZXJlcy1hLW5ldy1ub3ZlbHR5LWNha2UtaW4tdG93bi1hc2Rhcy1ncmV0YS10aGUtZ2x1dGVuLWZyZWUtZ3VpbmVhLXBpZy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Look out Colin there’s a new novelty cake in town: ASDA’s Gretel the (Gluten Free) Guinea Pig!,"Asda has launched a Free From Gluten version of its fan-favourite novelty guinea pig cake so that no shopper has to miss out on the furry friend fun.

Joining the supermarket’s novelty cake family Gretel has tasty gluten free vanilla-flavoured sponge filled with fruity raspberry jam. Topped with caramel-coloured frosting and sweet edible decorations Gretel is sure to make the cutest party companion.

A real crowd pleaser Gretel serves approximately 10 people (576g) and is also suitable for vegetarians. What’s more the gluten free version of Asda’s Guinea Pig cake comes in cheaper than the original novelty cake (£10) at just £6.

Marks and Spencer started the novelty cake craze back in 1990 with its chocolate roll cake. which it named Colin the Caterpillar.

Discount supermarket ALDI famously introduced a copy-cat product that they named Cuthbert. Legal action brought by M&S against the similar product was eventually settled out of court.

Other supermarkets also carry similar caterpillar products including Morris the Caterpillar from Morrisons the Curious Caterpillar at the Co-Op Cecil the Caterpillar at Waitrose Clyde the Caterpillar at Asda Wiggles the Caterpillar at Sainsbury’s Clive the Caterpillar at One Stop and Curly the Caterpillar at Tesco.

The owner of the Solow building at 9 W. 57th St. is creating a luxury medical center on the 24th floor complete with an operating room for medical procedures for tenants.

At 9 W. 57th St. — which houses Chanel asset manager Apollo Global Management and private-equity firm Veritas Capital — the landlord is building a luxury medical center on the 24th floor along with a tenant-only amenity floor with a restaurant and bar as well as a basement-level health center.

“Almost all modern-day buildings have health clubs” said Michael Hershman CEO of the Soloviev Group owner of the Solow Building. “Our chairman Stefan [Soloviev] thought ‘what can we do for our tenants that would really be a step up in amenities particularly in light of the health problems created in the pandemic?’ He wanted a medical center staffed by physicians with some free services offered to clients.”

The center under construction now will include an operating room for various cosmetic procedures said Dr. Steven Victor a cosmetic dermatologist and regenerative medicine specialist who is Soloviev Group’s chief medical officer and is running the center.

Tenants can also get procedures as simple — and free — as a COVID test or a blood pressure check in the center or even at their desks.

Busy executives “will certainly love the idea of visiting their physician without having to do more than a vertical commute to get there” said Paul Wexler of The Corcoran Group a health care real estate broker.

The medical center is part of a larger push by commercial landlords across the city — which were hit by the pandemic with surging vacancies and plummeting property values — to use attractive incentives to get companies to sign new deals in their buildings or stay put.

“Amenities used to be nice to have” said tenant broker Bill Montana of Savills. “Now they are a necessity. There is enormous competition between companies to attract and retain talented knowledge workers. And with many workers reluctant to return to the office these imaginative amenities are an effective tool to convince them to resume their daily commute.”

Global Investment management company Nuveen is sprucing up its 665000-square-foot 730 Third Ave. where it has its corporate headquarters (in 340000 square feet). Renovations include the addition of a tenant-only food hall run by Restaurant Associates two beehives and a luxury gym with personal trainers spa-like showers and towel service.

“You want to attract tenants that want a very differentiated experience so their [hiring of] employees — and retention of employees — are very high and the experience they have when they’re at the office is something that they actually strive to be a part of versus maybe saying ‘oh I can keep doing this and work from home and it doesn’t matter'” explained Paul Amrich of the commercial real estate firm CBRE.

The landlord at 730 Third Ave. in Manhattan has amenities on par with luxury hotels to lure and retain tenants.

Nuveen is also converting a retail space in the building into a tenant-only lounge with Topgolf golf simulators a wet bar TV and food available via the building app per Brian Wallick a director of New York investments at the company.

“Any building with a significant block of space is doing whatever they can to distinguish themselves” said Natasha Brown New York regional head of asset management at Nuveen.

Right now amenities don’t appear to be resulting in a monetary return on investment.

JB Pritzker purchased stock in large Medicaid contractor BGA says

SPRINGFIELD Ill. (WLS) -- A Better Government Association investigation claimed a blind trust connected to Governor JB Pritzker bought stock in one of the state's biggest Medicaid contractors.

The purchase of stock in health insurance giant Centene Corp. was made on behalf of the billionaire governor by trustees at Northern Trust appointed by Pritzker to independently manage his portfolio to separate those investment decisions from his role as the state's most powerful elected official.

The investment in Centene which collected more than $2.6 billion from state Medicaid contracts in the first half of 2021 demonstrated the pitfalls of a blind-trust arrangement that still leaves the nation's richest governor open to potential conflicts of interest according to the Better Government Association investigation.

The communications director for Pritzker's campaign said the governor has no involvement in investment decisions. In a statement to ABC7 Natalie Edelstein said ""Governor Pritzker did divest his personal portfolio of companies holding state contracts and then removed himself from all investment decisions."" Edelstein added that ""to suggest he broke his campaign pledge is false"" and ""the trustees provide Governor Pritzker only with an annual report of his assets which contains no values in order to sign his Statement of Economic Interests pursuant to the Illinois Governmental Ethics Act.""

The issue of stock purchases by elected officials has been debated in Congress which is considering an array of strengthened stock disclosure laws aimed at stopping lawmakers from profiting from their access to insider information.

""This effort is being undertaken because members of Congress are personally engaged in trading stock which Governor Pritzker is not. Governor Pritzker does not personally make any investments nor has he been involved in any discussions at any time regarding any investments since taking office"" Pritzker's campaign said.

Experts interviewed by the Better Government Association said the governor could have avoided potential conflict by instructing his trust managers to refrain from investing in state contractors. Pritzker's spokespeople declined to say whether he ever considered doing so.

""I don't see why a trustee couldn't operate within those bounds especially given that he seems to have acknowledged the potential of a conflict with his pledge to divest of companies that hold state contracts"" said Eleanor Eagan of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.

Neither Pritzker representatives nor the managers of his trust would say how much the investment in Centene is worth to Pritzker's bottom line. They also declined to say specifically when the stock purchase was made the BGA said.

When asked whether the governor after learning he became invested in one of the state's largest contractors sometime during 2020 took steps to recuse himself from decisions that directly affected the company's finances his spokeswoman told the BGA he has not.

""The governor is not involved in the contracting process related to Centene"" said Jordan Abudayyeh Pritzker's communication director. ""There is nothing he would have to recuse himself from.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

HOUSTON Texas (KTRK) -- CenterPoint customers are shocked by a recent spike in natural gas bills and one Houston energy expert said people should be prepared to see the increase in prices for months.

Mali Stewart has lived in Missouri City for nearly 14 years. Stewart said she expects her gas bill to increase in the summer and sometimes during the cold winter months. But this month she was shocked to see that her natural gas bill more than doubled totaling $181.11

""I was just shocked"" Stewart said ""I just jumped. You know I said 'No way.'""

Stewart soon learned she was not alone. When she checked her neighborhood app she found hundreds of her neighbors were experiencing the same thing some stating their gas bill was triple more than usual.

Stewart said she lives on a fixed income and was already trying to adjust to the inflation that has impacted the cost of nearly everything.

""If it's going to go up like everything else it's going to be difficult for me"" she said.

ABC13 reached out to CenterPoint Energy and a spokesperson responded stating there are multiple factors playing a role in the increased market prices of natural gas.

Below is the statement sent to ABC13 Friday afternoon:

""We recognize that there's been concern recently about the rising market price of natural gas. We're focused on this but it's important to put it in context. The combination of reduced natural gas production and higher demand has caused the increased market prices we are seeing. Customer natural gas bills are not only affected by price; they are also affected by weather. A mild or cold winter can make a big difference on customers' monthly heating bills - December 2021 was unusually warm; January 2022 was a cold month and more in line with normal winter weather and therefore contributed to higher usage.

The Gas Cost Adjustment (GCA) line that appears on every monthly natural gas bill is the cost CenterPoint Energy pays for the gas we deliver to our customers. The price we pay for natural gas in the market is the same price we charge our customers there is no mark-up or profit for CenterPoint Energy. In February we adjusted the GCA from $0.61363 per cubic feet of natural gas to $0.74405 per cubic feet of natural gas per our regular biannual rate adjustment process. The price customers pay depends on their consumption and the current natural gas prices.

Regarding extraordinary costs incurred during Winter Storm Uri last February CenterPoint Energy filed an application with the Railroad Commission of Texas on July 30 2021 to securitize these extraordinary natural gas costs and ease the financial impact on our Texas natural gas customers from record natural gas prices during Winter Storm Uri. The Commission approved the filing this month. Therefore the Texas Public Finance Authority will issue the customer rate-relief (CRR) bonds which we expect to happen in the second half of this year. All natural gas sales customer bills would begin to reflect the recovery of Winter Storm Uri costs upon the issuance of CRR bonds. This recovery option is designed for the company to recover its prudently incurred natural gas costs while protecting customers against unexpected increases on their monthly bills.

We encourage customers to contact us if they are having difficulty paying their CenterPoint Energy natural gas bill. Customers can also take some simple steps now that will save energy and save money on their winter heating bills.""

Stewart said she finds it hard to believe that CenterPoint or any energy company is not making a profit from the increased prices.

""They say CenterPoint doesn't make money. I don't believe that"" Stewart said. ""I think someone is making money over this. I just hope they fix it.""

Charles McConnell a former assistant U.S. energy secretary and energy center officer at the University of Houston said people should brace themselves to see this spike in natural gas bills for months to come.

""When there's uncertainty in the marketplace that gets reflected in prices forward strips and commodities"" McConnell said. ""Also in general with gas especially the whole issue of storage of gas and the availability of the gas weather-related issues supply-related issues and all of that speaks to the fact that we don't have a tremendous amount of gas storage back up. It's very much like an on-demand supply system.""

McConnell said he anticipates Russia invasion in Ukraine will cause another disruption to supply and impact demand.

""About one-third of Russia's gas actually flows through Ukraine and ultimately ends up in a lot of markets in Europe Germany Poland France etc."" McConnell explained. ""As you see those markets now losing the supply from what used to be the former Soviet Union now the Russia-Ukraine circumstance that will create an additional demand for gas and in situations where you see the demand increase that's a pretty good indicator that prices will go up and so sourcing that demand will ramp up over time.""

The California Council on Science and Technology had just revealed that the testing and treatment of hazardous chemicals in oil field wastewater used for irrigation was inadequate and legislators were demanding increased oversight. They feared that oil companies’ wastewater was threatening groundwater needed for drinking water and growing crops.

Faced with heightened scrutiny the California’s Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board raced to secure a consultant to study the controversial practice and soon settled on GSI Environmental as both qualified and unbiased.

Last fall armed with GSI’s completed studies the board tried to put concerns about the practice to rest assuring the public that the firm had found “no identifiable increased health risks” from irrigating crops with water recycled from oil wells.

But the board should never have chosen GSI scientists public interest activists and former regulators said in interviews citing the firm’s close ties to the oil industry—ties so close that GSI once listed on its website Chevron ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum as clients “we answer to.”

Chevron is the largest producer of oil field wastewater for irrigation in California. The company saves millions of dollars in disposal costs by selling the “produced water” to a local water district which in turn sells it to farmers in Kern County to irrigate their water-intensive almonds pistachios and citrus.

When the water board retained GSI the firm had already earned millions of dollars helping Chevron defend its interests in a single court case.

In addition to Chevron GSI had also helped other corporate polluters defend themselves against claims of environmental and health harms by providing litigation support and expert witness testimony documents filed in state and federal courts show.

Beyond its legal defense services GSI regularly takes research funds from the chemical and fossil fuel industries and collaborates on research with scientists who work for these industries a review of the scientific literature shows.

And it has published commentaries that cast doubt on evidence that oil and gas extraction or chemical industry products cause harm without disclosing its litigation support for these industries or its industry funding as a conflict of interest.

Robert Scofield who led the work for GSI said in a statement via email to Inside Climate News that his firm performed the studies in “the most technically sound manner.”

Despite the water board’s public assurances about food safety experts say GSI’s studies do not provide sufficient evidence to support those claims. And the board’s own Food Safety Expert Panel concluded that the studies could not answer fundamental safety questions about irrigating crops with water recycled from oil wells.

Defending Chevron in Court

GSI Environmental a Houston-based firm with California offices has a long history of working for oil companies and the law firms that defend them.

In 2010 John Connor president of GSI took the stand in a Mississippi circuit court on behalf of Chevron. He had come to defend the oil giant against five women from Fayette—a town whose residents are predominantly poor and Black—who blamed Chevron for their children’s health and intellectual disabilities.

The women had worked in a building converted from a gas station that their lawyers tied to Texaco bought by Chevron in 2001. They believed leaded gas fumes from storage tanks left underground had seeped into the building while they were pregnant and caused their children’s disabilities.

Connor testified that a gas station across the street was to blame. But the women’s lawyers offered proof that there had never been a gas station across the street. Three days after Connor’s testimony a jury awarded the women $19 million.

During the trial Connor acknowledged that between 2000 and 2010 Chevron paid his firm nearly $8 million documents filed with the Circuit Court of Jefferson County show. Between 2004 and 2008 GSI received roughly $5 million for what Connor testified was “a major undertaking” for Chevron’s defense against Indigenous Ecuadoreans seeking damages from Texaco for allegedly dumping billions of gallons of produced water in the rainforest.

Connor had been tapped as a lead expert witness for Chevron by the international law firm King & Spalding which also defends the tobacco industry.

“There’s a sense that if someone has done work for one party that they’re somehow beholden to that party but it’s not really the case” Connor said. “In our case we work for all kinds of different companies. And we don’t take on the mantle of any of those companies.”

Connor estimated that litigation support accounts for about 30 percent of GSI’s business. “Some of it’s been for government” he said. “A lot of it’s for industry on their problems.”

The water board had determined that GSI did not appear to have a bias “that would be unacceptable.” A simple Google search reveals Connor’s public testimony about GSI’s work for Chevron in Ecuador.

The water board had required proposed consultants to “execute” a disclosure statement in an agreement between the board and the oil companies and water districts it regulates. But neither the board nor GSI could find a copy of a completed statement. Connor said the board never sent it.

Clay Rodgers the official in charge of the water control board’s food safety review said he had no proof of sending it but if he didn’t it was likely a simple oversight. “We reviewed GSI’s background extensively” Rodgers said “noting that they had done some work for oil companies in the past.”

Rodgers said he was not aware of GSI’s expert witness and litigation support for the oil industry.

Scofield GSI’s lead on the project told a water board official that he could not find a disclosure statement in the firm’s files in an email obtained by Inside Climate News. Scofield also told the water board official that GSI met the board’s criteria. “Specifically we ‘possess the experience expertise and impartiality necessary to ensure the quality of the Study’” Scofield wrote paraphrasing the board’s requirements for a consultant. Chevron representative Jonathan Harshman said the water board chose a consultant based on the firm’s qualifications and integrity. The water board staff found GSI Environmental “to be well qualified and unbiased in their approach” said Harshman communications advisor for Chevron’s San Joaquin Valley Business Unit.

Successful highly qualified consulting firms work for a multitude of companies said Rodgers who worked nearly two decades in private consulting himself. The board took steps to limit contact between GSI and the oil districts and water districts that paid their fees he said adding that it would have been “almost impossible” to find a consultant that did no work for oil companies but had the expertise needed for this type of project.

“You’re going to disqualify perhaps most of the highly qualified folks if you say you can never have done any work for an oil company” he said.

“That’s the problem in a nutshell” said Benjamin Franta a doctoral candidate at Stanford University where he studies the behavior of the fossil fuel industry. “When conflicts of interest become so pervasive that they become normalized and there’s no alternative that’s a problem.”

Industry Influence on the Panel

The Central Valley water board convened its expert panel in 2015 to make sure it wasn’t missing potential health harms from growing crops with produced water. Two experts on the nine-member panel had ties to the oil industry. One expert had worked for the consulting firm ERM whose clients included a California spinoff of Occidental Petroleum California Resources Corporation or CRC.

Another was nominated by Chevron which initially paid for her participation. Mark Bradford who joined the seven-member water board three years after the panel was formed had long worked for ERM when he was appointed to the board by former Gov. Jerry Brown. Bradford now chairs the water board.

At the Food Safety Panel’s first public meeting in 2016 Mark Jones a panel member then working for the consulting firm ERM presented a study sponsored by Occidental spinoff CRC a provider of produced water.

Jones who based his study on CRC data from its Kern Front oil field assured the panel that produced water from the company’s oil field fell below levels of concern for every chemical analyzed in every crop tested.

But Jones had looked for just a fraction of the chemicals that might be in the crops. When a public health scientist on the panel Seth Shonkoff asked Jones if he thought his data accurately reflected what was in the wastewater water coming from the oil fields Jones acknowledged he didn’t know.

Soon after it became clear that Jones worked as a paid consultant for the oil industry a coalition of public interest organizations urged the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board to require panel members to disclose conflict of interests on forms made public.

The board declined explaining in a letter that it was unnecessary because panel members had been asked to “base their scientific conclusions on an objective assessment of all relevant evidence” rather than voice the views of their affiliated organizations. In any event the board wrote Jones is no longer employed by ERM.

The groups made another appeal for disclosure in June 2017 after learning that a second panel member Barbara Petersen had been nominated by Chevron. Petersen works for Exponent which also consults for oil and gas companies.

Chevron funded her participation through much of the first year then her position was funded by CalFLOWS through at least May 2017. CalFLOWS is a tax-exempt coalition of business farming and energy interests concerned about the state’s water future. Its board of directors includes representatives of Chevron CRC and another supplier of produced water Aera Energy.

Petersen did not respond to several requests for comment. Jones who now works for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said through an agency spokeswoman that he did not feel comfortable talking about his role with the panel because he no longer works on the project.

Months after public interest groups again raised their concerns about the expert panel’s makeup they still had seen no response from the board Bill Allayaud California government affairs director for the Environmental Working Group a nonprofit environmental advocacy organization said at a public meeting. “Is there a response to that yet?” he asked Rodgers.

We’re hiring! Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. See jobs

“We did look at what we considered viable potential conflicts of panel members” Rodgers replied explaining that the board wanted a group that represented all the stakeholders.

“I had a lot of complaints about Dr. Shonkoff being part of the panel that he was biased in his approach” Rodgers added at the meeting referring to Seth Shonkoff executive director of Physicians Scientists and Engineers (PSE) for Healthy Energy a nonprofit research institute. “My comment was ‘I need a panel that represents everybody. I want Dr. Shonkoff on the panel because he represents a different view.’”

Asked later in an interview who had complained about Shonkoff Rodgers declined to tell Inside Climate News.

Western States Petroleum Association or WSPA which lobbies on behalf of Chevron Exxon and other oil giants paid Exponent and ERM $169000 between 2016 and 2020 for consulting and other unspecified services campaign finance disclosures show.

Shonkoff said he told the board early on that it was of the “utmost importance” that advisory boards fill out conflict of interest forms. There should be a transparent process that reveals who has a stake in the project’s outcome he said. “We did not go through that process.”

Shonkoff himself was approached by the Environmental Defense Fund which wanted to pay for his time on the panel. He felt being funded by an environmental advocacy group would be inappropriate and turned down the offer.

“Scientific knowledge generation should not be conducted by a stakeholder group” said Shonkoff the only panel member who had published several peer-reviewed studies on the public health effects of oil and gas operations. “It needs to be independent.”

Turning Waste into a Resource

Produced water is the oil and gas industry’s largest waste stream across the country.

Regulators don’t track what California oil companies pay to dispose of it. But Eric Hoek a professor of engineering at the University of California Los Angeles said costs range from about 10 cents a barrel for on-site disposal to as much as $15 a barrel to truck it to a permitted disposal well.

For an industry that disposes of more than 700 million barrels of wastewater each year—about 29.4 billion gallons—disposal is a costly proposition. Chevron can save more than half a million dollars a year by selling its wastewater to a local water district.

That’s why Chevron forged a deal with the Cawelo Water District north of its Kern River Oil Field in the mid-1990s. Chevron saw an opportunity to reduce disposal costs and Cawelo welcomed an alternative water source for farmers in one of the state’s driest agricultural regions.

Farmers in Kern County the center of California’s oil industry use about 36000 acre-feet of produced water a year to grow mostly water-intensive almonds pistachios and citrus. That’s nearly 12 billion gallons or enough to cover about 36000 football fields with a foot of water. Chevron supplies nearly two-thirds of farmers’ produced water in California.

At the first public meeting Cawlelo’s general manager David Ansolabehere said the district pays as much as $170 an acre-foot to pump groundwater and up to $200 an acre-foot for surface water—that is when it’s available. In contrast the district pays just $30 an acre-foot for produced water providing an incentive to expand the practice.

To ensure continued access to a cheap reliable water source the district hired its own consultant Enviro-Tox to analyze crops just as the Food Safety Project got underway. The district also hired a PR firm to help field media inquiries from around the world said Ansolabehere.

The firm Fiona Hutton & Associates also handles public relations for WSPA the oil industry trade group.

WSPA spent nearly $9 million to lobby state politicians and regulators in 2014 when California tightened rules on produced water and more than $2 million in the last quarter of 2016 when WSPA lobbyists approached the Central Valley Water Board and other regulators about “food safety for produced water for agriculture.”

The Central Valley water board took over Cawelo’s testing program Ansolabehere noted in a 2019 memo to “eliminate a potential perceived conflict of interest with Cawelo managing the food safety analysis process.”

The board also turned down Cawelo’s suggestion to use its consultant for the Food Safety Project studies concerned that Enviro-Tox’s previous work for oil companies presented a conflict said Jessica Jahr counsel for the State Water Resources Control Board.

Instead Cawelo proposed GSI Environmental.

“We Answer to Them”

Ansolabehere said he recommended GSI because they’d done similar work in the past and could “perform the work in the time allotted.”

GSI’s Scofield asked if he had disclosed his firm’s work for the oil industry including providing expert testimony in court replied by email: “The organizations to whom we have provided our scientific consulting services are identified on our web page and are available to all parties.”

Told there is no list of clients on GSI’s website he acknowledged that the current site does not identify clients and that there appear to be no live links to past web pages that did.

The Internet Archive does provide those links. On a 2010 page promoting its services under the heading WE ANSWER TO THEM Chevron tops the list of industrial clients followed by ExxonMobil Monsanto Halliburton Schlumberger Occidental Petroleum and BASF.

“Oil companies are companies that have environmental problems” said GSI’s Connor. “That’s what we work on so we work for them.”

A lot of people in the scientific community work for different parties Connor said. “It’s not expected that you’re going to say ‘Hey I worked for this one company so my opinion is colored by that.’”

Connor said he’s aware of concerns of bias around consulting for pharmaceutical companies. “But that’s not a consideration in our business” he said. “Everybody that does what we do works for a lot of different companies.”

There’s abundant evidence that industry involvement in research tends to produce findings that favor the sponsor’s product said Lisa Bero professor of medicine and public health and chief scientist at the University of Colorado’s Center for Bioethics and Humanities. This so-called funding effect has been documented in the tobacco chemical drug food and fossil fuel industries among others.

“I think most people are not even aware there are consulting firms that are hired by big companies to basically do science for hire” said Stanford’s Franta.

If a firm has a history of working with an industry with a vested interest in the outcome of an enterprise or has any current or prospective future financial interest in that industry—such as revenues from consulting work—that’s a conflict of interest he said.

“If you worked for them in the past it stands to reason that you might work for them again and that’s an ongoing interest” he said. “That’s why even past work should be disclosed.”

The business model of these types of “product defense” consulting firms is to produce reports that polluting corporations can use to slow regulation or win court cases said David Michaels a George Washington University professor of environmental and occupational health and former head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

“These firms only write reports that are in the interests of their corporate clients” said Michaels whose book “Triumph of Doubt” details how regulated industries manufacture scientific uncertainty to protect their bottom line. If their reports found their client’s product was dangerous he added “they’d lose business.”

“Bent” Science

Several years ago Wayne Landis an expert in ecological risk assessment at Western Washington University set out to evaluate the sustainability of hydraulic fracturing with his student MariAnna Lane.

When they dug into the technical literature they didn’t find much research. And much of what they did find was “severely bent” said Landis referring to a strategy described in the book “Bending Science: How Special Interests Corrupt Public Health Research.”

Science is “bent” when it is “willfully manipulated to serve a predetermined policy goal” Landis and Lane explained in their chapter for the 2016 book Environmental and Health Issues in Unconventional Oil and Gas. Industries often deploy the strategy to deflect blame and liability though Landis and Lane found examples in government academia and nongovernmental organizations as well.

The pair encountered different degrees of bending science Landis said in an interview but one group stood out as an “excellent example”: GSI Environmental.

GSI’s Connor and his colleagues published papers on the source of methane contamination of groundwater in a poor rural region of northeastern Pennsylvania where dozens of families had sued Cabot Oil & Gas claiming its drilling polluted their wells. GSI coauthored the papers with Cabot Oil & Gas scientists and thanked the company one of the biggest drillers in the Marcellus Shale for permission to publish their data.

The studies concluded that methane contamination was a natural feature of the region’s geology unrelated to fracking.

That GSI absolved fracking of responsibility for contaminating groundwater might not have seemed suspect Landis and Lane wrote in their chapter if it hadn’t also attacked contrary research that did implicate fracking using inflammatory language not typically found in scientific discourse.

It’s common for scientists to critique papers using precise terms that dissect the methods and data analysis. They don’t use loaded language he said in the interview like calling harmful findings “allegations” as GSI did on its web site.

“Mr. Landis incorrectly criticized peer-reviewed publications by two GSI staff members” Connor wrote in an email. “Mr. Landis is not an expert in the scientific topics of these publications and it does not appear that he reviewed the technical content of the papers.”

That reply is actually bending science Landis said. “We had very specific criteria” he said which laid out the kinds of terminology used when someone intentionally bends science.

Landis said the fact that Connor attacked his technical expertise but not his evaluation of the language as evidence of bending science is telling. His response Landis said “was bolstering this case that it was bending science.”

In an interview Connor said that researchers who had linked fracking to groundwater contamination wouldn’t release their data. In fact the scientists had an agreement with homeowners to protect the address of their wells and released the data in a way that retained their privacy.

Last July Physicians for Social Responsibility or PSR reported that Chevron ExxonMobil and other major oil and gas companies had used toxic chemicals called PFAS in more than 1200 wells in six states. Scientists have linked the perfluorinated compounds dubbed “forever chemicals” because they don’t break down to developmental delays thyroid disease impaired immune function cancer and other serious health problems.

After a flurry of national stories about the report GSI Environmental scientists led by Connor posted a critique on the firm’s web site.

“We find that this article presents an inaccurate and exaggerated picture of the use of PFAS in hydraulic fracturing and the risks posed to public health and the environment” Connor and his GSI colleagues wrote.

They listed eight reasons why readers should not believe PSR’s report and noted in a news release that GSI received “no third-party funding” for the critique.

The same year GSI did acknowledge funding from the FluoroCouncil PFAS-manufacturers’ trade group to publish a framework to assess the chemicals’ toxicity. The FluoroCouncil promotes the claim contrary to independent research that new “short chain” compounds are safer than their “long chain” counterparts PFOA and PFOS which have been phased out due to concerns about their human health and environmental risks.

Connor said he had nothing to do with the FluoroCouncil project so it wouldn’t have been on his mind. And when a firm works for a lot of different companies it’s not expected to disclose funding for just doing a “project” he said. “That’s not how it’s done. It doesn’t represent any type of failure to disclose.”

Furthermore he added the GSI paper had nothing to do with whether PFAS was dangerous or safe which is a FluoroCouncil issue but whether it was in fracking fluid. “I wouldn’t say that was a failure to disclose” Connor said “because it’s about the use of that material in the oil industry.”

Yet Linda Birnbaum former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and an expert on the substances read the GSI critique as a dismissal of public health concerns around most PFAS. She said the firm claimed the public health concerns PSR described apply only to the most well-known compounds PFOA and PFOS not to other fluorinated compounds.

“That’s just not true” Birnbaum said.

Meanwhile the water board entrusted a consulting firm that has defended the oil industry against high-stakes claims of environmental and health harms to conduct unbiased studies in the public interest. Had the board asked about the firm’s work for oil companies—the ones it once listed on its web site—it may have considered alternatives.

There are many many other kinds of organizations that could be neutral parties that really are neutral and do the type of research that informs policy Landis said.

That’s a role universities and especially the state universities and land grant universities that are used to doing applied work can play he said. “There was no need to go to an industry stalwart.”

The original plans were to open this spring. Chipotle will take over the former Krispy Kreme building at 4911 Frederica Street after a nearly $700000 remodel.

A Chipotle spokesperson confirmed the timeline has been moved back but could not provide any other details at this point.

A building permit was issued Feb. 17 to remodel the existing building for a new restaurant with a construction cost of $698814. A permit was also issued January 11 to install a $34000 sign for Chipotle.

The lot housing the former Krispy Kreme building was sold last year to California businessman Jacob Fedder under the Mali Frederica LLC on May 28 for $1150000. The building opened in June 2016 but the Krispy Kreme location permanently closed in February 2018. The .69-acre lot was also formerly home to a KFC.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8va3Npc3JhZGlvLmNvbS9iZW50b24tY291bnR5LWphaWwtYWRtaW5pc3RyYXRvci1hY2N1c2VkLW9mLXN0YXR1dG9yeS1yYXBlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Benton County Jail Administrator Accused of Statutory Rape,"According to a facebook post from Benton County Sheriff Eric Knox on Saturday afternoon Benton County Jail Administrator Nick Murphy was arrested on Friday morning and later charged with statutory rape or attempted statutory rape with a person less than 14.

“I feel it is my duty and obligation to keep you informed when it comes to your Sheriff’s Office. It is important to me to always be transparent and honest with you at all times sharing the good and the bad. The need for and the importance of integrity is paramount with that in mind I write to you with a heavy heart.

I was shocked to my core as I received a call from the Division of Drug and Crime Control Missouri State Highway Patrol’s investigative unit at approximately 8:40 AM Friday February 25th 2022 informing me that my jail administrator Nick Murphy 42 of rural Warsaw was picked up at his residence and transported to a neighboring county where he was placed on a 24-hour investigative hold pending formal charges.

At approximately 5:30 PM the same day a special prosecutor from Platte County brought charges against Murphy for statutory rape or attempted statutory rape-1st degree with a person less than 14 years of age and two counts of statutory sodomy or attempted statutory sodomy-deviate sex with a person less than 14 years of age. These charges carry the “unclassified” classification meaning that it is up to the judicial process to determine the punishment rather than a predetermined classification such as an A B or C class felony if Murphy should be found guilty. Murphy is being held in the Pettis County Jail with no bond at this time.

My office and the office of prosecutor of Benton County will have no involvement in this case to ensure a fair and unbiased process as Murphy’s case moves forward. Murphy has been placed on administrative unpaid leave until further notice. I want to remind you that all individuals charged by law enforcement are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Any questions or concerns should be directed to the Public Information’s Officer with Troop A Headquarters in Lee’s Summit 816-622-0800.”

“I’m a little behind so I’ll start attacking that big time” he told The Denver Post soon after he was hired. “I know our scouts have been working their butts off.”

As Hackett undertook the process to make 19 hires to his staff Paton caught up with his scouts. The organization began draft meetings Feb. 14 the day after the Super Bowl.

The NFL offseason kicks into high gear this week when every team travels to Indianapolis for the Scouting Combine which returns after being canceled last year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Paton Hackett and Co. will evaluate and meet with prospects talk with agents for impending Broncos free agents and (wink wink) run into the representation of free agents from other teams.

During an interview with The Post Paton hit on many topics including outside linebacker Bradley Chubb the performance of the 2021 draft class the lack of big plays by the receivers and the importance of traveling last fall to watch the projected top college quarterbacks.

Bradley Chubb

Last May the Broncos picked up Chubb’s fifth-year option which guarantees his 2022 salary of $13.926 million — currently the team’s third-highest salary cap number behind left tackle Garett Bolles ($21 million) and safety Justin Simmons ($15.1 million).

Chubb admittedly had a 2021 to forget … or to serve as motivation. He underwent offseason ankle surgery sat out the opener at the New York Giants and played only 19 snaps in the Week 2 victory at Jacksonville. A second surgery sidelined him until Week 12.

In six post-surgery games Chubb was booked by The Post for 4 1/2 pass-rush “disruptions” (no sacks three knockdowns and 1 1/2 pressures) while playing 30-53 snaps. His “splash” play was an interception at Las Vegas to set up a touchdown.

“I really admire him” Paton said. “Look at what he overcame. He came back and he wasn’t the old Bradley Chubb but he fought through two surgeries worked his butt off in rehab to get back when we were in the (playoff) hunt and when we weren’t in it he was playing as hard as he could in the last game (against Kansas City). I respect Bradley. He brings it every day. He’s a warrior. I know he’s going to get back to where he was.”

The Broncos could sign Chubb to a contract extension to lower his ’22 cap number but they aren’t in a cap space crunch so it would make sense to see how he starts the season.

When Paton was in the Minnesota front office the Vikings picked up the fifth-year option on six of their nine first-round picks. Before the start of their fifth regular-seasons safety Harrison Smith and cornerback Xavier Rhodes signed extensions.

“You look at each situation and they’re all different” Paton said when asked if that should serve as a guide for the Chubb talks. “I just appreciate Bradley fighting back. He might be one of the tougher players I’ve ever been around.”

2021 rookie class

Six players from Paton’s initial Broncos draft played in at least 14 games and 331 offensive or defensive snaps. Hackett should feel confident about entering the offseason program in mid-April with starters at cornerback (Pat Surtain II) running back (Javonte Williams) somewhere along the offensive line (Quinn Meinerz) and inside linebacker (Baron Browning).

Did the class exceed expectations?

“No” Paton said. “Exactly what we were hoping. I think some of them can be a little better. I think some of them I was hoping for a little more. I really liked the rookie class. The guys from Day 1 who were pros were Surtain Javonte and Meinerz.

“I’m really impressed with Browning and (safety) Caden Sterns. And (outside linebacker) Jonathon Cooper — he’s a pro. They (all) need to take the next step.”

Surtain played 902 snaps in 16 games and intercepted four passes. Williams in a work-share with veteran Melvin Gordon rushed 203 times for 903 yards. Browning had 56 tackles in the eight games he started and finished. Sterns the dime (sixth defensive back) defender could get a chance to replace Kareem Jackson.

And what about Meinerz? He replaced right guard Graham Glasgow (broken ankle) at halftime of the Week 8 win at Dallas and worked at center in training camp.

“He can be a really good guard” Paton said. “I wouldn’t limit him to guard; I think he could be a really good center. He has the size he’s athletic and he’s really smart. We’ll see what the coaches think of this (offensive line) group but I think we have some pieces.”

The Broncos currently have five of the top 100 picks in this year’s draft.

The receivers

Paton’s bye-week work last November was signing receivers Courtland Sutton (four years $60 million) and Tim Patrick (three years $30 million) to new contracts ahead of free agency.

But over the final seven games after Sutton/Patrick signed their contracts and Jerry Jeudy returned from his Week 1 high ankle sprain the Broncos’ top three receivers struggled — 47 catches and one touchdown (by Patrick). Only 10 of their receptions gained at least 16 yards.

“They all need to play better and they want to be great” Paton said. “They’re all really talented. We need to be better around them. We need to get the best out of them. You can’t point to one thing — you can’t point to the quarterback (or) the scheme. They have to be better and they know that. But they’re hungry and they’re prideful.”

Obviously trading for Aaron Rodgers or Russell Wilson to play quarterback will improve the production of Sutton Patrick and Jeudy who will count a combined $24.6 million on this year’s cap. But something was amiss when all three players were healthy.

The projected fourth receiver KJ Hamler who was limited to 88 snaps before tearing his ACL in Week 3 is a “long shot” to participate in organized team activities this spring Paton said.

Scouting quarterbacks

If the Broncos go the short-term veteran quarterback option in the free agency/trade market they should have their collective eye trained on a quarterback in the first two rounds.

Last year Paton passed on Justin Fields and Mac Jones at No. 9 to select Surtain. This year’s quarterback class isn’t nearly as highly regarded as the 2021 first-round group of Trevor Lawrence Zach Wilson Trey Lance Fields and Jones. Paton made it a point last fall to see top quarterbacks Kenny Pickett (Pittsburgh) Sam Howell (North Carolina) Malik Willis (Liberty) and Matt Corral (Ole Miss) play in person.

“There is so much you can see in-person that you can’t on tape” Paton said. “How are they in pre-game warm-ups? What is their body type? How does the ball jump out of their hand? How do they spin it? How are they after they throw an interception? What are they like in between series on the bench — are they talking to their teammates? How are they in (the) two-minute (drill)? There are just so many things.

A mansion on the Black Sea coast often linked to Russian president Vladimir Putin has been refashioned to include a church equipped with a throne according to a report by Russian investigative outlet Proekt. It published the videos of ""Putin's palace"" which were recently renovated. The existence of the mansion was first revealed in 2021 by Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny who had said that it has a wine cellar a casino and an ice rink. Russia has not official reacted to the Proekt report.

The palace is sealed off from rest of the Russia by 17000 acres of forest and a special no-fly zone.

""Many viewers of Navalny's video remembered the entertainment areas - with a pole a casino as well as a room with toy cars and a railway"" Proekt said in its report adding that none of these areas exist anymore.

It also said that renovations suggest Putin ""seems to be obsessed with war and religion"".

The photos show a home church featuring a triptych and a wooden throne. The walls of the room are decorated with crosses and the triptych appears to depict a ""Saint Prince Vladimir"" two art historians and one icon painter said Proekt further said.

The outlet made a particular mention of a chandelier which it said has been made using red crystals from the French manufacturer Baccarat and costs $1 million.

In his 2021 video Mr Navalny had claimed that the property costs $1.3 billion and alleged it was paid for via an elaborate corruption scheme in which Putin gave top jobs and lucrative government projects to his allies at partially state-owned energy giants.

Thousands of Russians had come out on the streets in 2021 when Mr Navalny published the expose on Mr Putin's Black Sea complex.

But Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had dismissed the claims in the report at the time calling it ""pure nonsense"".",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jaHVyY2gtZGlzcnVwdGlvbnMtb24tdGhlLXJpc2UtdGhyb3VnaG91dC1waXR0c2J1cmdoLWFyZWEtaW4tcmVjZW50LXdlZWtzL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9waXR0c2J1cmdoL25ld3MvY2h1cmNoLWRpc3J1cHRpb25zLW9uLXRoZS1yaXNlLXRocm91Z2hvdXQtcGl0dHNidXJnaC1hcmVhLWluLXJlY2VudC13ZWVrcy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Church disruptions on the rise throughout Pittsburgh area in recent weeks,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) -- From Irwin to North Braddock to Ross Township multiple types of disruptions impacting church services have taken place throughout the Pittsburgh area within the last several weeks.

One of the incidents involved a gun pulled on a pastor during a sermon while another consisted of vandalism impacting an organ and sound equipment.

New federal funding has been approved to help increase security for places of worship and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer says that all types of churches are welcome to apply.

Places of worship can apply for funding through the Nonprofit Security Grant Program and can use the funds for whatever they would like as long as it helps add security. The deadline to apply for funding is May 21.

""I thank God because only God stopped and jammed this gun.""

A man was arrested in North Braddock on Sunday after pulling a gun on a pastor during his sermon at the Jesus' Dwelling Place Church -- and it was all caught on camera.

Bernard Polite is facing attempted homicide and aggravated assault charges and is accused of trying to shoot and kill the pastor.

Pennsylvania State Police have charged Bernard Polite 26 of Braddock after he entered and attempted to shoot pastor Glenn Germany while the pastor was delivering a sermon at Jesus' Dwelling Place Church on Sunday. Pastor Glenn Germany / Facebook

As the pastor ducked out of the way Polite was tackled by a deacon and held down on the ground until police arrived.

Police are also investigating after a man was found shot to death in Polite's home near the church. It's unclear if he is responsible for that shooting.

""All churches are sacred places which should be treated with respect.""

A church in Westmoreland County fell victim to vandalism late last week and is looking for help identifying the teenagers responsible for the damage.

As a result of the vandalism the church was unable to use the organ for the first two Holy Communion masses the following morning.

""It was an important sacramental day for our parish and the children and their families were affected by the two teenager's actions"" Father John Moineau. ""All churches are sacred places which should be treated with respect.""

The church is now asking for help identifying the two teenagers and say that information will be turned over to Irwin Police.

""It would be nice if people could just practice their religions in peace.""

It was the music that changed first. Or maybe that's just when many people at the pale brick Catholic church in the quiet Wisconsin neighborhood finally began to realize what was happening. The choir director a fixture at St. Maria Goretti for nearly 40 years was suddenly gone. Contemporary hymns were replaced by music rooted in medieval Europe. So much was changing. Sermons were focusing more on sin and confession. Priests were rarely seen without cassocks. Altar girls for a time were banned. At the parish elementary school students began hearing about abortion and hell. ""It was like a step back in time"" said one former parishioner still so dazed by the tumultuous changes that began in 2021 with a new pastor that he only spoke on condition of anonymity. It's not just St. Maria Goretti. Across the U.S. the Catholic Church is undergoing an immense shift. Generations of Catholics who embraced the modernizing tide sparked in the 1960s by Vatican II are increasingly giving way to religious conservatives who believe the church has been twisted by change with the promise of eternal salvation replaced by guitar Masses parish food pantries and casual indifference to church doctrine. The shift molded by plummeting church attendance increasingly traditional priests and growing numbers of young Catholics searching for more orthodoxy has reshaped parishes across the country leaving them sometimes at odds with Pope Francis and much of the Catholic world. The changes are not happening everywhere. There are still plenty of liberal parishes plenty that see themselves as middle-of-the-road. Despite their growing influence conservative Catholics remain a minority. Yet the changes they have brought are impossible to miss.

The progressive priests who dominated the U.S. church in the years after Vatican II are now in their 70s and 80s. Many are retired. Some are dead. Younger priests surveys show are far more conservative. ""They say they're trying to restore what us old guys ruined"" said the Rev. John Forliti 87 a retired Twin Cities priest who fought for civil rights and reforms in Catholic school sex education. Doug Koesel an outspoken 72-year-old priest at Blessed Trinity Parish in Cleveland was blunter: ""They're just waiting for us to die."" At St. Maria Goretti once steeped in the ethos of Vatican II many parishioners saw the changes as a requiem. ""I don't want my daughter to be Catholic"" said Christine Hammond whose family left the parish when the new outlook spilled into the church's school and her daughter's classroom. ""Not if this is the Roman Catholic Church that is coming."" But this is not a simple story. Because there are many who welcome this new old church. They often stand out in the pews with the men in ties and the women sometimes with the lace head coverings that all but disappeared from American churches more than 50 years ago. Often at least a couple families will arrive with four five or even more children signaling their adherence to the church's ban on contraception which most American Catholics have long casually ignored. They attend confession regularly and adhere strictly to church teachings. Many yearn for Masses that echo with medieval traditions — more Latin more incense more Gregorian chants. ""We want this ethereal experience that is different from everything else in our lives"" said Ben Rouleau who until recently led St. Maria Goretti's young adult group which saw membership skyrocket even as the parish shrank amid the turmoil. They are Rouleau said happily out of touch with a liberal city like Madison. ""It's radical in some ways"" Rouleau said. ""We're returning to the roots of the church.""

Three decades of progressive change If this movement emerged from anywhere it might be a now-demolished Denver football stadium and a borrowed military helicopter carrying in Pope John Paul II. Some 500000 people descended on Denver in 1993 for the Catholic festival World Youth Day. When the pope's helicopter landed just outside Mile High Stadium the ground shook from the stomping. The pope whose grandfatherly appearance belied an electric charisma and who was beloved both for his kindness and his sternness confronted an American church shaped by three decades of progressive change. If the church is often best known to non-Catholics for its opposition to abortion it had grown increasingly liberal since Vatican II. Birth control was quietly accepted in many parishes and confession barely mentioned. Catholic social teaching on poverty suffused churches. Most priests traded in their cassocks for plain black shirts with Roman collars. Incense and Latin became increasingly rare. On some issues John Paul II agreed with these liberal-minded Catholics. He spoke against capital punishment and pushed for workers' rights. He preached relentlessly about forgiveness — ""the oxygen that purifies the air of hatred."" He forgave his own would-be assassin. But he was also uncompromising on dogma warning about change and cracking down on liberal theologians. He urged a return to forgotten rituals. Catholics ""are in danger of losing their faith"" he told crowds at the final Denver Mass decrying abortion drug abuse and what he called ""sexual disorders"" a barely veiled reference to growing acceptance of gay rights. Across the nation fervent young Catholics listened. Newman Centers which serve Catholic university students became increasingly popular. So did FOCUS a traditionalist organization working on American college campuses. Conservative Catholic media grew particularly the cable TV network EWTN a prominent voice for increased orthodoxy.

Today conservative Catholic America has its own constellation of online celebrities aimed at young people. There's Sister Miriam James an ever-smiling nun in full habit who talks openly about her hard-partying college days. There's Jackie Francois Angel who speaks in shockingly frank detail about sex marriage and Catholicism. There's Mike Schmitz a movie-star handsome Minnesota priest who exudes kindness while insisting on doctrine. Even today surveys show most American Catholics are far from orthodox. Most support abortion rights. The vast majority use birth control. But increasingly those Catholics are not in church. In 1970 more than half of America's Catholics said they went to Mass at least once a week. By 2022 that had fallen to 17% according to CARA a research center affiliated with Georgetown University. Among millennials the number is just 9%. Even as the U.S. Catholic population has jumped to more than 70 million driven in part by immigration from Latin America ever-fewer Catholics are involved in the church's most important rites. Infant baptisms have fallen from 1.2 million in 1965 to 440000 in 2021 CARA says. Catholic marriages have dropped by well over two-thirds. The shrinking numbers mean that those who remain in the church have outsized influence compared with the overall Catholic population. On the national level conservatives increasingly dominate the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference and the Catholic intellectual world. They include everyone from the philanthropist founder of Domino's Pizza to six of the nine U.S. Supreme Court justices. Then there's the priesthood. Young priests driven by liberal politics and progressive theology so common in the 1960s and 70s have ""all but vanished"" said a 2023 report from The Catholic Project at Catholic University based on a survey of more than 3500 priests. Today's young priests are far more likely to believe that the church changed too much after Vatican II tangling itself up in America's rapidly shifting views on everything from women's roles to LGBTQ people. ""There really aren't very many liberals in the seminaries anymore"" said a young recently ordained Midwestern priest. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the turmoil that engulfed his parish after he began pressing for more orthodox services. ""They wouldn't feel comfortable.""

Slow shift toward orthodoxy Sometimes the shift toward orthodoxy happens slowly. Maybe there's a little more Latin sprinkled into Mass or an occasional reminder to go to confession. Maybe guitars are relegated to Saturday evening services or dropped completely. And sometimes the changes come like a whirlwind dividing parishes between those thirsting for a more reverent Catholicism and those who feel their spiritual home has been taken from them. ""You'd leave Mass thinking 'Holy cow! What just happened?'"" said another ex-parishioner at St. Maria Goretti whose family eventually left the church describing the 2021 promotion of a new pastor and a sudden focus on sin and confession. Like many former parishioners he spoke only on condition of anonymity worried about upsetting friends still at the church. Diocesan clergy did not respond to requests for interviews. ""I'm a lifelong Catholic. I grew up going to church every Sunday"" he said. ""But I'd never seen anything like this."" The new outlook has spilled across America. In churches from Minnesota to California parishioners have protested changes introduced by new conservative priests. In Cincinnati it came when the new priest abandoned gospel music and African drumming. In small-town North Carolina it was an intense focus on Latin. In east Texas it was a right-wing bishop forced out by the Vatican after accusing Pope Francis of undermining church teachings. Each can seem like one more skirmish in the cultural and political battles tearing at America. But the movement whether called conservative or orthodox or traditionalist or authentic can be hard to define. It ranges from Catholics who want more incense to Latin Mass adherents who have brought back ancient prayers that mention ""the perfidious Jew."" There are right-wing survivalists celebrity exorcists environmentalists and a handful of quasi-socialists. There's the Catholic news outlet railing against the Vatican's ""wicked entourage"" and the small-town Wisconsin priest who traces COVID-19 to a century-old prophecy and warns of looming dictatorship. There's the recent ""Catholic Prayer for Trump"" a $1000-a-plate dinner at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort featuring a string of conspiracy theorists.

Yet the orthodox movement can also seem like a tangle of forgiveness and rigidity where insistence on mercy and kindness mingle with warnings of eternity in hell. Looming over the American divide is Pope Francis who has pushed the global church to be more inclusive even as he toes the line on most dogma. The orthodox movement has watched him nervously from the first days of his papacy angered by his more liberal views on issues like gay relationships and divorce. Some reject him entirely. And the pope clearly worries about America. The U.S. church has ""a very strong reactionary attitude"" he told a group of Jesuits last year. ""Being backward-looking is useless."" A new vision of Catholic America You can find this new vision of Catholic America at Latin Masses in Milwaukee the pews crowded with worshippers even at noon on a weekday. It's in conferences held in California wine country at reinvigorated parishes in Tennessee and prayer groups in Washington D.C. And it's at a little Kansas college built high on a bluff above the Missouri River. At first glance nothing seems unusual about Benedictine College. Students worry about unfinished essays and the complexities of dating. They wear cutoff shorts on warm autumn afternoons. Football is huge. The cafeteria food is mediocre. But look deeper. Because at Benedictine Catholic teaching on contraception can slip into lessons on Plato and no one is surprised if you volunteer for 3 a.m. prayers. Pornography premarital sex and sunbathing in swimsuits are forbidden. If these rules seem like precepts of a bygone age that hasn't stopped students from flocking to Benedictine and other conservative Catholic colleges. At a time when U.S. college enrollment is shrinking Benedictine's expansion over the last 15 years has included four new residence halls a new dining hall and an academic center. An immense new library is being built. The roar of construction equipment never seems to stop. Enrollment now about 2200 has doubled in 20 years. Students many of whom grew up in conservative Catholic families jokingly call it ""the Benedictine bubble."" And it might be a window into the future of the Catholic Church in America.

In a deeply secular America where an ever-churning culture provides few absolute answers Benedictine offers the reassurance of clarity. ""We don't all agree on everything obviously"" said John Welte a senior majoring in economics and philosophy. ""But I would say everyone has an understanding of like truth."" ""There are certain things you can just know in your mind: This is right and this is wrong."" Sometimes people here quietly admit it goes too far. Like the students who loudly proclaim how often they go to Mass or the young man who quit his classics course because he refused to read the works of ancient Greek pagans. Very often talk here echoes the 13th-century writings of St. Thomas Aquinas who believed God could be found in truth goodness and beauty. Sometimes they say that means finding God in strict tenets about sexuality. Sometimes in the haunting beauty of Gregorian chants. ""It's a renewal of like some really really good things that we might have lost"" said Madeline Hays a pensive 22-year-old senior biology major. She takes the church's rules seriously from pre-marital sex to confession. She can't stand modern church architecture. She's seriously considering becoming a nun. But she also worries about poverty and America's wastefulness and the way Americans — including herself — can find themselves slotted into the political divide without even knowing it. She wrestles with her belief in an unerring Catholic doctrine that can see good people including some of her own friends as sinners. Yet she doesn't want change. ""The church wouldn't be the church if it changed things it had set down as 'This is infallible doctrine and this will not change through the ages' "" she said. They understand that in Benedictine's small mostly closeted gay community. Like the young man once deeply religious who suffers in silence as people on campus casually throw around anti-gay slurs. He's thought many times of leaving but generous financial aid keeps him here. And after many years he's accepted his sexuality. He's seen the joy that people can get from Benedictine how some will move back to Atchison after graduation just to stay close. But not him. ""I don't think I'll come back to Atchison — not ever.""

Remodeling a spiritual home For decades the pews at St. Maria Goretti were filled with the families of plumbers engineers and professors from the University of Wisconsin just a couple miles up the road. The church is a well-kept island of Catholicism tucked into the leafy residential streets of one of America's most liberal cities. Like so many other parishes it had been shaped by the ideals of the 1960s and 1970s. Poverty and social justice became tightly interwoven with sermons and parish life. Gay people felt welcome. Some of the church's moral absolutes like the contraception ban became forgotten dogma. Change arrived in 2003 with a new bishop Robert C. Morlino an outspoken conservative. Many liberals remember him as the man who lambasted the message of acceptance in the modern hymn ""All Are Welcome."" His successor Bishop Donald J. Hying steers clear of public battles. But in many ways he quietly carries on Morlino's legacy warning about ""the tangled thinking of Modernism."" In 2021 Hying named the Rev. Scott Emerson a one time top Morlino aide as pastor of the Madison church. Parishioners watched — some pleased some uneasily — as their spiritual home was remodeled. There was more incense more Latin more talk of sin and confession. Emerson's sermons are not all fire-and-brimstone. He speaks often about forgiveness and compassion. But his tone shocked many longtime parishioners. Protection is needed he said in a 2023 service from ""the spiritual corruption of worldly vices."" He has warned against critics — ""the atheists journalists politicians the fallen-away Catholics"" — he said were undermining the church. For some Emerson's changes were welcome. ""A lot of us were like 'Hey more confession! Sweet!"" said Rouleau who ran the parish young adult group. ""Better music!""

(CBS Newspath/3TV/CBS 5/WKRC) – A Phoenix couple had their homeowner’s insurance policy canceled after that company learned they adopted a pit bull. According to the cancellation notice their insurance company referred to the dog as “an ineligible breed.”

Linda Wiggs said they adopted Echo from a shelter a few months back. They wanted a companion for their other dog an Australian shepherd named Izzy.

“Echo came into our life and she’s caused all kinds of fun things to happen joy” Wiggs said.

Linda Wiggs said they adopted Echo from a shelter a few months back.

It started last month when the insurer reached out to do an inspection of their home. They said an agent came by and asked what breed Echo is. They told them she was a pit bull. They didn’t think anything of it.

“She’s never nipped at any of our neighbors"" Wiggs said. ""My husband takes her for walks every morning.""

A couple of weeks later a letter arrived in the mail. Their homeowner’s insurance policy had been canceled. They also terminated it for the couple’s second home in Indiana. Echo hasn’t even been there.

“I was so shocked surprised couldn’t believe someone would just discriminate against on a breed” Wiggs said.

Arizona’s Family went to Peter Sheppard with Mr. Insurance for insight.

“There’s a particular number about 15 or so breeds that insurance companies will steer clear of” Sheppard said.

The Hartford Financial Services Group sent the following statement:

""Millions of people are bitten by dogs every year and dog bites are a leading cause of liability claims against homeowners. As such we have underwriting guidelines about dogs that are based on risk. Generally speaking we ask customers if they have a dog when they apply for homeowner’s insurance and we make decisions about whether to provide insurance accordingly. If after we provide homeowner’s coverage we learn of a dog that poses a risk we reserve the right to cancel the policy. Upon cancellation we offer an appeal process. However we take the privacy of customers seriously and are not going to discuss an individual’s specific circumstances.""

Sheppard says that aside from reading the fine print of the insurance policy customers should “Talk to your agent your representative local representatives usually know more the local statutes.""

State Rep. John Kavanagh is proposing a measure that would prohibit dog breed discrimination. It would keep insurers from charging higher premiums for homeowners and renters. A House committee approved it and is heading to the full House.",,,,,,,,,

Ada kisah tersendiri mengapa nama itu yang dipilih sang pemilik. Penasaran dengan kisahnya? Simak yuk!

Singkawang tak cuma punya vihara saja tapi wisata waterboom juga ada. Waterboom Taman Cinta begitu warga Singkawang mengenal destinasi ini. Lokasinya ada di Jalan Raya Pajintan Singkawang Timur Singkawang.

detikTravel berkunjung ke Taman Cinta beberapa waktu yang lalu dan menyempatkan untuk ngobrol-ngobrol dengan sang pemilik Sento Tanoro. Beberapa tahun yang lalu Sento tak pernah terpikir untuk membuat Taman Cinta. Semua berawal dari ketidaksengajaan.

""Awalnya di sini belum ada kolam renang. Dulu masih lubang bekas tambang danau-danau. Nggak ada daratan di sini. Tapi akhirnya kita bangun pelan-pelan"" kisah Sento kepada detikTravel.

Sampai pada tahun 2016 Taman Cinta mulai soft opening. Saat itu kondisinya masih belum seperti sekarang. Bahkan ada bagian kolam renang yang belum selesai tapi pengunjung sudah mulai berdatangan.

Tepat pada bulan Maret 2017 akhirnya destinasi ini diresmikan oleh Walikota Singkawang saat itu. Saat Taman Cinta dibuka pengunjungnya sampai antre dan bikin macet.

Tapi itu dulu. Sejak pandemi COVID-19 melanda jumlah pengunjung menurun drastis. Namun sekarang kondisi sudah mulai membaik.

""Kita 2021 sempat tutup satu bulan. Penurunan sampai 70% tinggal 30% saja. Sekarang sudah mulai meningkat Sabtu-Minggu bisa 400-500 orang"" kata Sento

Selain punya kolam renang Taman Cinta juga menyediakan penginapan. Bagi yang menginap di sini boleh sesuka hati berenang di kolam renang yang ada. Per malam harga sewa kamarnya hanya Rp 400 ribuan.

Mengenai nama Taman Cinta Sento mengaku tidak memberi nama itu. Awalnya destinasi ini hanya dikenal sebagai Waterboom Gunung Poteng karena lokasinya dekat dengan Gunung Poteng.

Sento Tanoro Foto: Wahyu Setyo Widodo/detikTravel Sento Tanoro Foto: Wahyu Setyo Widodo/detikTravel

Yang memberikan nama Taman Cinta menurut Sento adalah budayawan Singkawang Norman Bong. Saat itu dia mengunggah foto waterboom ini di Facebooknya dan menyebut tempat itu sebagai Taman Cinta.

Sejak saat itu waterboom ini jadi bernama Waterboom Taman Cinta. Selain itu menurut cerita Sento dulu ada karyawan yang inisiatif membuat taman dengan lambang love. Awalnya satu lalu kemudian jadi ada sepasang. Maka dari itu disebut Taman Cinta.

""Tapi percaya nggak percaya karyawan yang pernah kerja di sini kalau dia janda jadi punya jodoh lho. Ini beneran"" Sento berseloroh.

Sento yang dulu berbisnis mesin jahit di Jakarta akhirnya sekarang menetap di Singkawang dan mengurusi waterboom bikinannya itu. Sebagai putra daerah dia membangun destinasi wisata ini untuk memajukan kampung halamannya.

Traveler yang mau berenang dan berwisata di Taman Cinta harga tiket masuknya Rp 40.000 per orang. Waterboom ini buka dari jam 07.00 pagi sampai 18.00 WIB.

Let us know how we can make it better.

Duo integrates with your Cisco ASA VPN to add two-factor authentication to any VPN login.

Overview

The Cisco AnyConnect RADIUS instructions support push phone call or passcode authentication for AnyConnect desktop and mobile client connections that use SSL encryption. This configuration offers a text-based Duo prompt over RADIUS Challenge and captures client IP information for use with Duo policies such as geolocation and authorized networks.

The SAML VPN instructions feature inline enrollment and the interactive Duo Prompt for both web-based VPN logins and AnyConnect 4.6+ client logins. This deployment option features Duo Single Sign-On our cloud-hosted SAML 2.0 identity provider. Primary and Duo secondary authentication occur at the identity provider not at the ASA itself.

Please refer to the Duo for Cisco AnyConnect VPN with ASA or Firepower overview to learn more about the different options for protecting ASA logins with Duo MFA.

If you need to protect connections that use Cisco's desktop VPN client (IKE encryption) use our Cisco IPSec instructions.

Before starting make sure that Duo is compatible with your Cisco ASA device. Log on to your Cisco ASDM interface and verify that your Cisco ASA firmware is version 8.3 or later.

To integrate Duo with your Cisco ASA SSL VPN you will need to install a local proxy service on a machine within your network. This Duo proxy server also acts as a RADIUS server — there's usually no need to deploy a separate additional RADIUS server to use Duo.

If you are already running a Duo Authentication Proxy server in your environment you can generally use that existing host for additional applications appending the new configuration sections to the current config.

Connectivity Requirements This application communicates with Duo's service on SSL TCP port 443. Firewall configurations that restrict outbound access to Duo's service with rules using destination IP addresses or IP address ranges aren't recommended since these may change over time to maintain our service's high availability. If your organization requires IP-based rules please review Duo Knowledge Base article 1337. Effective June 30 2023 Duo no longer supports TLS 1.0 or 1.1 connections or insecure TLS/SSL cipher suites. See Duo Knowledge Base article 7546 for additional guidance.

Walkthrough Video

First Steps

Before moving on to the deployment steps it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with Duo administration concepts and features like options for applications available methods for enrolling Duo users and Duo policy settings and how to apply them. See all Duo Administrator documentation.

You should already have a working primary authentication configuration for your Cisco ASA SSL VPN users before you begin to deploy Duo.

To integrate Duo with your Cisco ASA SSL VPN you will need to install a local Duo proxy service on a machine within your network. This Duo proxy server will receive incoming RADIUS requests from your Cisco ASA SSL VPN contact your existing local LDAP/AD or RADIUS server to perform primary authentication and then contact Duo's cloud service for secondary authentication.

If you are already running a Duo Authentication Proxy server in your environment you can use that existing host for additional applications appending the new configuration sections to the current config. You don't have to set up a new Authentication Proxy server for each application you create. However there are some cases where it might make sense for you to deploy a new proxy server for a new application like if you want to co-locate the Duo proxy with the application it will protect in the same data center.

We recommend the following operating systems for the system hosting the Duo Authentication Proxy:

Windows Server 2016 or later

CentOS 7

CentOS Stream 8 or later

Fedora 37 or later

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or later

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later

Debian 11 or later

The Duo End of Sale Last Date of Support and End of Life Policy states that Duo does not offer support for integrations running on operating system versions beyond the vendor’s stated Last Date of Support date.

See detailed Authentication Proxy operating system performance recommendations in the Duo Authentication Proxy Reference.

We do not recommend installing the Duo Authentication Proxy on the same Windows server that acts as your Active Directory domain controller or one with the Network Policy Server (NPS) role. If you must co-locate the Duo Authentication Proxy with these services be prepared to resolve potential LDAP or RADIUS port conflicts between the Duo service and your pre-existing services.

Then you'll need to:

Sign up for a Duo account. Log in to the Duo Admin Panel and navigate to Applications . Click Protect an Application and locate Cisco RADIUS VPN in the applications list. Click Protect to get your integration key  secret key  and API hostname . You'll need this information to complete your setup. See Protecting Applications for more information about protecting applications in Duo and additional application options.

Treat your secret key like a password The security of your Duo application is tied to the security of your secret key (skey). Secure it as you would any sensitive credential. Don't share it with unauthorized individuals or email it to anyone under any circumstances!

Install the Duo Authentication Proxy

If you will reuse an existing Duo Authentication Proxy server for this new application you can skip the install steps and go to Configure the Proxy.

The Duo Authentication Proxy can be installed on a physical or virtual host. We recommend a system with at least 1 CPU 200 MB disk space and 4 GB RAM (although 1 GB RAM is usually sufficient). See additional Authentication Proxy performance recommendations in the Duo Authentication Proxy Reference.

We do not recommend installing the Duo Authentication Proxy on the same Windows server that acts as your Active Directory domain controller or one with the Network Policy Server (NPS) role. If you must co-locate the Duo Authentication Proxy with these services be prepared to resolve potential LDAP or RADIUS port conflicts between the Duo service and your pre-existing services.

Windows

Linux Download the most recent Authentication Proxy for Windows from https://dl.duosecurity.com/duoauthproxy-latest.exe. Note that the actual filename will reflect the version e.g. duoauthproxy-6.4.0.exe. View checksums for Duo downloads here. Launch the Authentication Proxy installer on the target Windows server as a user with administrator rights and follow the on-screen prompts. When installing you can choose whether or not you want to install the Proxy Manager. The Proxy Manager is a Windows utility that helps you edit the Duo Authentication Proxy configuration determine the proxy's status and start or stop the proxy service. Learn more about using the Proxy Manager. Installing the Proxy Manager adds about 100 MB to the installed size. If you do not want to install the Proxy Manager you may deselect it on the ""Choose Components"" installer screen before clicking Install. Silent Install To perform a silent install on Windows issue the following from an elevated command prompt after downloading the installer (replacing version with the actual version you downloaded): duoauthproxy-version.exe /S Append /exclude-auth-proxy-manager to install silently without the Proxy Manager: duoauthproxy-version.exe /S /exclude-auth-proxy-manager Ensure that Perl and a compiler toolchain are installed. On most recent RPM-based distributions — like Fedora Red Hat Enterprise and CentOS — you can install these by running (as root): $ yum install gcc make libffi-devel perl zlib-devel diffutils On Debian-derived systems install these dependencies by running (as root): $ apt-get install build-essential libffi-dev perl zlib1g-dev If SELinux is present on your system and you want the Authentication Proxy installer to build and install its SELinux module include selinux-policy-devel and chkconfig in the dependencies: $ yum install gcc make libffi-devel perl zlib-devel diffutils selinux-policy-devel chkconfig $ apt-get install build-essential libffi-dev perl zlib1g-dev selinux-policy-devel chkconfig Download the most recent Authentication Proxy for Unix from https://dl.duosecurity.com/duoauthproxy-latest-src.tgz. From the command line you can use curl or wget to download the file like $ wget --content-disposition https://dl.duosecurity.com/duoauthproxy-latest-src.tgz . Depending on your download method the actual filename may reflect the version e.g. duoauthproxy-6.4.0-src.tgz. View checksums for Duo downloads here. Extract the Authentication Proxy files and build it as follows: $ tar xzf duoauthproxy-6.4.0-src.tgz $ cd duoauthproxy-version-src $ make Install the authentication proxy (as root): $ cd duoauthproxy-build $ ./install Follow the prompts to complete the installation. The installer creates a user to run the proxy service and a group to own the log directory and files. You can accept the default user and group names or enter your own. If SELinux is present on the target server the Duo installer will ask you if you want to install the Authentication Proxy SELinux module. Your selection affects whether systemd can start the Authentication Proxy after installation. SELinux Mode Default Response Result Enforcing Yes Choose 'yes' to install the Authentication Proxy's SELinux module. This permits start of the Authentication Proxy service by systemd. If you choose 'no' then the SELinux module is not installed and systemd cannot start the Authentication Proxy service. Permissive No Choose 'no' to decline install of the Authentication Proxy's SELinux module. The Authentication Proxy service can be started by systemd. However if you change SELinux from permissive to enforcing mode after installing the Duo proxy systemd can no longer start the Authentication Proxy service. If you plan to enable SELinux enforcing mode later you should choose 'yes' to install the Authentication Proxy SELinux module now. If you choose to install the Authentication Proxy SELinux module and the dependencies selinux-policy-devel and chkconfig are not present then the installer fails to build the module. Silent Install To install the Duo proxy silently with the default options use the following command: sudo ./duoauthproxy-build/install --install-dir /opt/duoauthproxy --service-user duo_authproxy_svc --log-group duo_authproxy_grp --create-init-script yes Append --enable-selinux=yes|no to the install command to choose whether to install the Authentication Proxy SELinux module.

Configure the Proxy

After the installation completes you will need to configure the proxy.

The Duo Authentication Proxy configuration file is named authproxy.cfg and is located in the conf subdirectory of the proxy installation. With default installation paths the proxy configuration file will be located at:

Operating System Authentication

Proxy Version Path Windows v5.0.0 and later C:\Program Files\Duo Security Authentication Proxy\conf\authproxy.cfg Windows v4.0.2 and earlier C:\Program Files (x86)\Duo Security Authentication Proxy\conf\authproxy.cfg Linux All /opt/duoauthproxy/conf/authproxy.cfg

Note that as of v4.0.0 the default file access on Windows for the conf directory is restricted to the built-in Administrators group during installation.

The configuration file is formatted as a simple INI file. Section headings appear as:

[section]

Individual properties beneath a section appear as:

name=value

The Authentication Proxy may include an existing authproxy.cfg with some example content. For the purposes of these instructions however you should delete the existing content and start with a blank text file.

Duo Authentication Proxy Manager

The Duo Authentication Proxy Manager is a Windows utility for managing the Authentication Proxy installation on the Windows server where you install the Authentication Proxy. The Proxy Manager comes with Duo Authentication Proxy for Windows version 5.6.0 and later.

The Proxy Manager cannot manage remote Duo Authentication Proxy servers nor can you install the Proxy Manager as a stand-alone application. There is no Proxy Manager available for Linux. The Proxy Manager only functions as part of a local Duo Authentication Proxy installation on Windows servers.

Learn more about using the Proxy Manager in the Duo Authentication Proxy Reference before you continue.

To launch the Proxy Manager utility:

Open the Start Menu and go to Duo Security .

. Click the Duo Authentication Proxy Manager icon to launch the application. You must have administrative privileges on the Windows server and accept the prompt for elevation.

icon to launch the application. You must have administrative privileges on the Windows server and accept the prompt for elevation. The Proxy Manager launches and automatically opens the %ProgramFiles%\Duo Security Authentication Proxy\conf\authproxy.cfg file for editing.

Use the Proxy Manager editor on the left to make the authproxy.cfg changes in these instructions. As you type into the editor the Proxy Manager will automatically suggest configuration options. Accepting these suggestions helps make sure you use the correct option syntax.

As you follow the instructions on this page to edit the Authentication Proxy configuration you can click Validate to verify your changes (output shown on the right).

When you complete the Authentication Proxy configuration steps in this document you can use the Save button to write your updates to authproxy.cfg  and then use the authproxy.cfg button to start the Authentication Proxy service before continuing on to the next configuration steps.

If you do not use the Proxy Manager to edit your configuration then we recommend using WordPad or another text editor instead of Notepad when editing the config file on Windows.

Configure the Proxy for Your Primary Authenticator

In this step you'll set up the Proxy's primary authenticator — the system which will validate users' existing passwords. Determine which type of primary authentication you'll be using and create either an Active Directory/LDAP [ad_client] client section or a RADIUS [radius_client] section as follows.

Active Directory

Add an [ad_client] section if you'd like to use an Active Directory domain controller (DC) or LDAP-based directory server to perform primary authentication. This section accepts the following options:

Required

host The hostname or IP address of your domain controller or directory server. If this host doesn't respond to a primary authentication request and no additional hosts are specified (as host_2  host_3  etc.) then the user's login attempt fails. service_account_username The username of a domain account that has permission to bind to your directory and perform searches. We recommend creating a service account that has read-only access. This parameter not required when using SSPI authentication; see the auth_type optional parameter description in the Authentication Proxy Reference for more information. service_account_password The password corresponding to service_account_username . If you installed the Duo proxy on Windows and would like to encrypt this password see Encrypting Passwords in the full Authentication Proxy documentation. This parameter not required when using SSPI authentication; see the auth_type optional parameter description in the Authentication Proxy Reference for more information. search_dn The LDAP distinguished name (DN) of an Active Directory/LDAP container or organizational unit (OU) containing all of the users you wish to permit to log in. For example: search_dn=DC=exampleDC=com

Optional

host_2 The hostname or IP address of a secondary/fallback domain controller or directory server which the Authentication Proxy will use if a primary authentication request to the system defined as host times out. You can add additional servers as fallback hosts by specifying them as as host_3  host_4  etc. security_group_dn To further restrict access specify the LDAP distinguished name (DN) of a security group that contains the users who should be able to log in as direct group members. Nested groups are not supported. Users who are not direct members of the specified group will not pass primary authentication. Example: security_group_dn=CN=DuoVPNUsersOU=GroupsDC=exampleDC=com Starting with Authentication Proxy v3.2.0 the security_group_dn may be the DN of an AD user's primarygroup . Prior versions do not support primary groups. username_attribute LDAP attribute found on a user entry which will contain the submitted username. In most Active Directory configurations it should not be necessary to change this option from the default value. OpenLDAP directories may use ""uid"" or another attribute for the username which should be specified with this option. Default: ""sAMAccountName""

For example:

[ad_client] host=1.2.3.4 host_2=1.2.3.5 service_account_username=duoservice service_account_password=password1 search_dn=DC=exampleDC=com security_group_dn=CN=DuoVPNUsersOU=GroupsDC=exampleDC=com

For advanced Active Directory configuration see the full Authentication Proxy documentation.

RADIUS

To use RADIUS as your primary authenticator add a [radius_client] section to the top of your config file. Then add the following properties to the section:

Required

host The IP address of your primary RADIUS server. If this host doesn't respond to a primary authentication request and no additional hosts are specified (as host_2  host_3  etc.) then the user's login attempt fails. secret A secret to be shared between the Authentication Proxy and your existing RADIUS server. If you installed the Duo proxy on Windows and would like to encrypt this secret see Encrypting Passwords in the full Authentication Proxy documentation.

Optional

host_2 The IP address of a secondary/fallback primary RADIUS server which the Authentication Proxy will use if a primary authentication request to the system defined as host times out. You can add additional servers as fallback hosts by specifying them as as host_3  host_4  etc. port The authentication port on your RADIUS server. Use port_2  port_3  etc. to specify ports for the backup servers. Default: 1812 pass_through_all If this option is set to true  all RADIUS attributes set by the primary authentication server will be copied into RADIUS responses sent by the proxy. Default: false

For example:

[radius_client] host=1.2.3.4 host_2=1.2.3.5 secret=radiusclientsecret

In addition make sure that the RADIUS server is configured to accept authentication requests from the Authentication Proxy.

For advanced RADIUS configuration see the full Authentication Proxy documentation.

Configure the Proxy for Your Cisco ASA SSL VPN

Next we'll set up the Authentication Proxy to work with your Cisco ASA SSL VPN. Create a [radius_server_challenge] section and add the properties listed below. If you've already set up the Duo Authentication Proxy for a different RADIUS Challenge application append a number to the section header to make it unique like [radius_server_challenge2] .

Required

ikey Your integration key. skey Your secret key. api_host Your API hostname (e.g. ""api-XXXXXXXX.duosecurity.com""). radius_ip_1 The IP address of your Cisco ASA SSL VPN. radius_secret_1 A secret to be shared between the proxy and your Cisco ASA SSL VPN. If you're on Windows and would like to encrypt this secret see Encrypting Passwords in the full Authentication Proxy documentation. client The mechanism that the Authentication Proxy should use to perform primary authentication. This should correspond with a ""client"" section elsewhere in the config file. ad_client Use Active Directory for primary authentication. Make sure you have an [ad_client] section configured. radius_client Use RADIUS for primary authentication. Make sure you have a [radius_client] section configured. duo_only_client Do not perform primary authentication. Make sure you have a [duo_only_client] section configured. This parameter is optional if you only have one ""client"" section. If you have multiple each ""server"" section should specify which ""client"" to use.

Optional

port The port on which to listen for incoming RADIUS Access Requests. If you have multiple RADIUS server sections you should use a unique port for each one. If you have another service running on the server where you installed Duo that is using the default RADIUS port 1812 you will need to set this to a different port number to avoid a conflict. Default: 1812. failmode Either ""safe"" or ""secure"": ""safe"" In the event that Duo's service cannot be contacted users' authentication attempts will be permitted if primary authentication succeeds. This is the default. ""secure"" In the event that Duo's service cannot be contacted all users' authentication attempts will be rejected. prompt_format This controls how the Challenge message is formatted. Options console The proxy will return a textual prompt with a list of available authentication devices and lines separated by newline characters. This is most appropriate for console-based integrations and might not work correctly with web-based logins (e.g. SSL VPN devices). This is the default format. html The proxy will return the same textual prompt as with the ""console"" option but replace line breaks with HTML line-break (i.e. '<br />') tags. This is more likely to work correctly with web-based logins. short The proxy will format a simple short textual-challenge message listing only the available factor names (but not their descriptions). The proxy will also fall back on this format if any of the other options were selected but the message length exceeds the permissible length of a RADIUS challenge message. The more Duo factors your users enroll the longer the resulting RADIUS challenge prompt text will be and the more likely that user will see the short format prompt text. enroll_challenge The RADIUS specification allows for reply messages in both Access-Challenge and Access-Reject responses. However many devices will only actually display the reply message if it appears in an Access-Challenge. Thus while sending an Access-Reject response with the appropriate enrollment link would generally be more logical using an Access-Challenge will provide broader compatibility. If this option is set to true  then when an unenrolled user logs in the proxy will send back an enrollment message in a RADIUS Access-Challenge response but deny any subsequent responses to the challenge. If set to false  then the proxy will send back the enrollment message in an Access-Reject response. Default: true

A completed config file using Active Directory as the primary authenticator should look something like:

[ad_client] host=1.2.3.4 service_account_username=duoservice service_account_password=password1 search_dn=cn=Usersdc=exampledc=com [radius_server_challenge] ikey=DIXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX skey=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX api_host=api-XXXXXXXX.duosecurity.com failmode=safe client=ad_client radius_ip_1=5.6.7.8 radius_secret_1=radiussecret1 port=1812

Make sure to save your configuration file in your text editor — or validate and save in the Proxy Manager for Windows — when you're finished making changes.

Note View video guides for proxy deployment at the Authentication Proxy Overview or see the Authentication Proxy Reference for additional configuration options.

Start the Proxy

Windows

Linux If you installed the Duo Authentication Proxy Manager utility (available with 5.6.0 and later) click the Start Service button at the top of the Proxy Manager window to start the service. To start the service from the command line open an Administrator command prompt and run: net start DuoAuthProxy Alternatively open the Windows Services console ( services.msc ) locate ""Duo Security Authentication Proxy Service"" in the list of services and click the Start Service button. Authentication Proxy v5.1.0 and later includes the authproxyctl executable which shows the connectivity tool output when starting the service. The installer adds the Authentication Proxy C:\Program Files\Duo Security Authentication Proxy\bin to your system path automatically so you should not need to specify the full path to authproxyctl to run it. From an administrator command prompt run: authproxyctl start If the service starts successfully Authentication Proxy service output is written to the authproxy.log file which can be found in the log subdirectory. If you see an error saying that the ""service could not be started"" open the Application Event Viewer and look for an Error from the source ""DuoAuthProxy"". The traceback may include a ""ConfigError"" that can help you find the source of the issue. Stop and restart the Authentication Proxy service by either clicking the Restart Service button in the Duo Authentication Proxy Manager or the Windows Services console or issuing these commands from an Administrator command prompt: net stop DuoAuthProxy & net start DuoAuthProxy To stop and restart the Authentication Proxy using authproxyctl from an administrator command prompt run: authproxyctl restart Open a root shell and run: # /opt/duoauthproxy/bin/authproxyctl start To ensure the proxy started successfully run: # /opt/duoauthproxy/bin/authproxyctl status Authentication Proxy service output is written to the authproxy.log file which can be found in the log subdirectory. To stop and restart the Authentication Proxy open a root shell and run: # /opt/duoauthproxy/bin/authproxyctl restart

If you modify your authproxy.cfg configuration after initial setup you'll need to stop and restart the Duo Authentication Proxy service or process for your change to take effect.

You can view information about your Authentication Proxy in the Authentication Proxy Dashboard.

Configure Your Cisco ASA

Add the Duo RADIUS server

Navigate to AAA/Local Users → AAA Server Groups click Add and fill out the form: Setting Value AAA Server Group Duo-RADIUS Protocol RADIUS Click OK to create the new AAA server group. Select the Duo-RADIUS group you just added. In the Add AAA Server dialog enter the following information: Setting Value Interface Name The ASA interface where your Duo Authentication Proxy can be reached. Server Name or IP Address The hostname or IP address of your Duo Authentication Proxy. Timeout 60 seconds should be sufficient to complete authentication; see the FAQ item about timeouts. Server Accounting Port 1813 (Technically this setting does not matter because the Duo Authentication Proxy does not support RADIUS Accounting). Retry Interval 10 seconds Server Secret Key Shared Secret used in Authentication Proxy configuration. Microsoft CHAPv2 Capable Unchecked Click OK and then OK to save the new server. You can verify connectivity to the Duo RADIUS server now. With the Duo AAA server group you just created selected click the Test button. On the ""Test AAA Server"" form select Authentication. Enter the username of user that exists in Duo and has a valid authentication device (like a phone or token). In the ""Password"" field enter the password for that user. If the user only has token authenticators available you can append a comma followed by a passcode to the password like password123456. Click OK. If the user is set up for Duo Push or phone call authentication approve the Duo authentication request. A new form pops up letting you know if the test was successful or failed.

Change the SSL VPN Authentication Method to Duo

Navigate to Network (Client) Access → AnyConnect Connection Profiles Select the connection profile to which you want to add two-factor authentication and click Edit. In the Authentication section of the Basic profile settings page select Duo-RADIUS from the AAA Server Group list. Uncheck the Use LOCAL if Server Group fails option. Click OK then click Apply.

Click Save to write all changes to the ASA device memory.

Configure AnyConnect Timeout

It's a good idea to increase the AnyConnect Authentication Timeout so that users have enough time to use Duo Push or phone callback.

Navigate to Configuration → Remote Access VPN → Network (Client) Access → AnyConnect Client Profile and Click Edit. In the left menu navigate to Preferences (Part 2). Scroll to the bottom of the page and modify the Authentication Timeout (seconds) setting to 60 seconds. Click OK. Click Apply to activate the new AnyConnect Client settings. Click Save to write this change to the ASA device memory.

This timeout setting will take effect after each client successfully logs into the VPN after applying the new profile.

If you find that AnyConnect client connections disconnect after about 12 seconds please see the following FAQ: Why is the AnyConnect client connection attempt disconnecting after 12 seconds when I have increased the timeout?

Test Your Setup

Launch the AnyConnect client and select the VPN profile that now uses Duo RADIUS authentication. When prompted enter your primary login credentials.

After you enter your username and password a second AnyConnect window displays the Duo RADIUS challenge text prompt listing your available factors (or an enrollment URL).

Duo two-factor login for jdoe Enter a passcode or select one of the following options: 1. Duo Push to XXX-XXX-1234 2. Phone call to XXX-XXX-1234 3. SMS passcodes to XXX-XXX-1234 Passcode or option (1-3)

In the text response area type in the number that matches the option you want to use to log in. For example to log in with Duo Push after receiving the above challenge prompt enter 1 and then approve the Duo Push request you receive.

Instead of typing in the number that corresponds to the listed options you may also enter a Duo factor option:

push Perform Duo Push authentication. You can use Duo Push if you've installed and activated Duo Mobile on your device. phone Perform phone callback authentication. sms Send a new batch of SMS passcodes. Your authentication attempt will be denied. You can then authenticate with one of the newly-delivered passcodes. A numeric passcode Log in using a passcode either generated with Duo Mobile sent via SMS generated by your hardware token or provided by an administrator. Examples: ""123456"" or ""2345678"".

If you wanted to use Duo Push (rather than a passcode) to authenticate you would enter:

push

You can also specify a number after the factor name if you have more than one device enrolled (as the automatic push or phone call goes to the first capable device attached to a user). So you can enter phone2 or push2 if you have two phones enrolled and you want the authentication request to go to the second phone.

The format of the Duo RADIUS text challenge prompt may change if you have multiple authentication devices enrolled in Duo due to the character length limit of a RADIUS packet. If we detect that the user logging in has too many devices to list by number with full details the Duo proxy will automatically switch to a compact format like this.

Choose a secondary factor from (`push1` `phone1` `sms1`) or enter passcode:

Respond to this prompt in the same way by typing in either the name of a Duo factor listed or a number that matches a factor's position in the list.

In this AnyConnect client example one could type push  push1  or 1 to send a Duo push request to send a Duo push request to the phone with the 1311 number.

Once you approve the Duo authentication request or enter a valid passcode the AnyConnect client is connected to the VPN.

See the Challenge Mode End-User Instructions in the Duo User Guide for more details about the RADIUS challenge login experience.

If the RADIUS challenge response text doesn't display well in AnyConnect you may need to set the optional prompt_format setting for [radius_server_challenge] to a value other than the default of console in your Duo Authentication Proxy's authproxy.cfg file. Be sure to restart the Authentication Proxy service after making the change

SSL Browser Logins

If you also permit browser-based SSL VPN access via Clientless SSL VPN Access connection profiles then you can also configure a SSL VPN connection profile to use the Duo RADIUS server group you added for authentication. If you do this then logging into the web-based VPN via browser also shows the text-based RADIUS challenge screen where you can choose from your available factors or enter a passcode just like you can in AnyConnect.

Cisco’s enhanced IoT SaaS platform fulfills industry needs for more simplified data management at massive scale.

Cisco helps service providers expand into new markets and enable a broad range of IoT uses cases.

Cisco IoT Control Center manages all licensed cellular network connectivity giving service providers and enterprise customers choice and flexibility.

BARCELONA – Mobile World Congress – February 28 2022 – Cisco today announced advancements to its internet of things (IoT) portfolio to help its service provider customers offer a simpler way to manage LPWAN/4G/5G IoT connectivity for new and emerging use cases.

As industries look to evolve their digital strategies in support of hybrid work they need simplified solutions to connect and manage low-cost often-stationary devices deployed at massive scale (Mass IoT) such as utility meters medical devices and agricultural sensors.

Introduced today at Mobile World Congress Barcelona Cisco IoT Control Center now fulfills industry needs for Mass IoT with a new simplified and secure connectivity management package purpose-built for lower complexity IoT devices. Cisco IoT Control Center manages nearly 200 million devices today across all licensed cellular networks (LPWAN/4G/5G) giving operators and enterprises the flexibility to choose the network that works best for their use case.

With low bandwidth consumption and predictable usage patterns stationary devices are often connected over wide areas with 3GPP LPWAN networks. LPWAN supports a broad range of IoT use cases – from a water meter that sends a burst of data once a week to a city parking meter that handles transactions throughout the day and night. Remote management for these devices is less complex than those requiring continuous real-time mission critical data collection such as connected cars.

With its new Cisco IoT Control Center offer delivered as a subscription service service providers can now address the full range of enterprise use cases - from low-to-high complexity from a single platform. The new offer reduces connectivity management complexity and costs without compromising quality making it practical and profitable for service providers to drive new revenue streams and capitalize on new Mass IoT market opportunities.

""We are always looking for ways to make IoT more valuable and easier to use for our customers and now Cisco enables KPN IoT to profitably capitalize on LPWAN market opportunities via the IoT Control Center"" says Carolien Nijhuis EVP Internet of Things and Dataservices at KPN. ""Offering our enterprise customers a single platform to address the full range of IoT use cases is a great advantage and reduces complexity in our customer's deployments leverages existing integrations and improves cost efficiency.""

""We are very pleased to see the new Mass IoT capabilities available on the IoT Control Center platform“ says Marc Overton Managing Director Division X for BT's Enterprise business. ""These will enable the pursuit of emerging low-cost low-complexity IoT segments with a solution that better meets customers’ needs.""

“We strive to help our service provider customers enable new services and business outcomes for Mass IoT to simplify data collection from millions of devices” said Masum Mir Vice President and General Manager Cable Mobile and IoT Cisco. “With these enhancements to Cisco IoT Control Center our customers can expand into the LPWAN market using a proven platform to help a broad range of growing industries realize what the future of mobile IoT can do to transform their business.”

Black History Month is an opportunity for reflection and education. For me it began with my experience attending segregated schools until 1972. My experience with racism and segregation shaped my decision to attend North Carolina Central University (NCCU) one of our nation’s Historically Black Colleges & Universities (HBCUs). For the first time I learned about heroes in American history that looked like me. This unlocked a sense of belonging and possibility that has continued to motivate me many years later.

The safety I feel at Cisco mirrors the safety I felt at NCCU. When I joined Cisco in 2008 I viewed it as an opportunity to work in information technology and build a better life. Quickly I joined an Employee Resource Organization that connected and celebrated our African American/Black (AA/B) employees. With our shared experiences as a unifier I was able to become more authentic in what I was bringing to work as well as more committed to the work I was driving. In 2014 I was given the opportunity to help build stronger relationships with HBCUs to accelerate young AA/B talent to Cisco. Over the next several years I visited HBCUs to share the value of working at Cisco and this outreach has since become a key piece of our talent acquisition strategy.

Everything accelerated in 2020. In January of that year I alongside other AA/B employees met with Cisco’s Executive Leadership Team. This meeting established a set of executive-sponsored activities to accelerate representation promotion and investment in AA/B employees as well as education for external communities. With the murder of George Floyd in May these activities expanded to become Cisco’s Social Justice Actions a five-year commitment to the Black community as well as a blueprint for how Cisco will respond to injustice and address inequity for any community. These twelve actions are led centrally by an Inclusive Future Action Office where I currently lead Action 8 Commit to HBCUs.

Now almost two years later I am helping to lead one of the largest philanthropic efforts for HBCUs in corporate history while also fulfilling a lifelong dream of giving back to a community that shaped the leader I am today. Our commitment and framework for HBCUs was launched in May of last year. To date we have impacted more than 30 schools in 11 states through technology investments. We have awarded $12.5 million in endowments and $7.5 million in technology upgrades for STEM students and we have a deep alliance with our partners including the Student Freedom Initiative.

“As our first corporate supporter Cisco demonstrates leadership and an unwavering commitment to social justice and recognition of the enormous capability of Historically Black Colleges and Universities” shares Mark A. Brown Executive Director at the Student Freedom Initiative.

This quote brings to life our purpose to Power an Inclusive Future for All with a commitment to lead. Black History Month is a time for reflection and education both of which I am proud to do at Cisco. Looking forward I am committed to deepening our impact and sharing how we are doing in a future communication.

While much of the eastern half of Arkansas suffers from population loss and economic decline Jonesboro prospers. Between the 2010 and 2020 census Jonesboro's population increased 16.8 percent from 67263 to 78576 making it the fifth-largest city in the state.

Many Arkansans are aware of what's happening at Jonesboro but it's safe to say that most don't realize that the boom extends to Paragould. In fact I've begun referring to that area as the Jonesboro-Paragould corridor in recognition of the fact that the two cities have grown into one urban area.

Paragould's population increased 13.1 percent between 2010 and 2020 (26113 to 29537). Folks in central and northwest Arkansas don't realize that Paragould is now larger than Russellville West Memphis and Searcy. As recently as the 1970 census Paragould had 10639 residents. That grew to 15248 in 1980; 18540 in 1990; and 22017 in 2000.

There's no end in sight to the growth. I spoke last fall at the annual banquet of the Paragould Chamber of Commerce. Hundreds of people turned out despite the pandemic. It's easy to determine at events such as this when there's momentum in a town. Paragould not only has momentum it has business and civic leaders whose goals align.

First National Bank's Bill Brewer was awarded the chamber's lifetime achievement award. Brewer a graduate of Paragould High School and Arkansas State University personifies the type of business leaders who have propelled Paragould forward. He succeeded his father as board chairman at FNB. His son now serves as vice chairman of a bank that has served Paragould since 1889.

Earlier in 2021 FNB announced that it was expanding into the Nashville Tenn. market by acquiring Citizens Bank of Hartsville Tenn. The Paragould bank now has 24 locations in Arkansas and Tennessee. The expansion started in 1984 when the bank made its way to Corning. The first Jonesboro branch opened in 1998. Rogers and Heber Springs followed in 2014. The next year FNB's northwest Arkansas presence increased with locations at Bentonville Springdale Fayetteville and Johnson.

A move into the Little Rock market occurred in 2018. The previous fall ASU announced that the Convocation Center would now be known as First National Bank Arena. So yes the basketball arena in Jonesboro is named for a Paragould-based bank another symbol of Paragould's increasing importance to the regional economy.

Brewer recently told Arkansas Money & Politics: ""Good things are happening in Paragould. I think we're going to see a lot of things coming faster. ... I don't think central Arkansas and northwest Arkansas necessarily snubbed their noses at northeast Arkansas but I don't think they thought of us as newsworthy. I sure think we are now.""

Paragould once was viewed as a blue-collar manufacturing town. The city attracted the Ely-Walker shirt factory in 1937 the Ed White shoe factory in 1947 Wonder State Manufacturing in 1950 Foremost Foods' dairy division in 1952 and Emerson Electric Co. in 1955. Though the manufacturing base remains strong the Paragould economy is far more diversified than it was 20 years ago. Bankers and lawyers in nice suits can now be spotted in upscale downtown restaurants such as Chow At One Eighteen.

This city atop Crowley's Ridge got its name when the names of two railroad magnates James Paramore and Jay Gould were combined. Railroads controlled by the two men crossed in Greene County six miles south of the county seat of Gainesville. A community grew around the crossing. Postmaster Marcus Meriweather began calling it Paragould.

""Merchants first located on Front Street behind the present buildings facing west on Pruett Street"" Mack Hamblen writes for the Central Arkansas Library System's Encyclopedia of Arkansas. ""First to open were a tent saloon a fish business a tent hotel a bakery a blacksmith shop and a fruit stand. A hardware store and general store opened on Main at the Pruett Street intersection. Soon the area had more merchants than Gainesville.

""Within a year Pruett Street became the main business location in town. In spite of the street's slimy mire several Gainesville businessmen opened stores there. When the county clerk moved his newspaper the Press to Paragould in 1884 it marked the beginning of Gainesville's demise. After a countywide vote in September 1884 Paragould became the county seat though it had no city government.""

The Paragould City Council first met in May 1885. The Greene County Courthouse was completed in 1888 and Paragould City Hall opened two years later.

""Having noted that fire swept rapidly through wooden buildings in downtown Gainesville in 1890 the Paragould City Council passed an ordinance requiring that new buildings in the main part of town be constructed of brick"" Hamblen writes. ""An electric light plant went into operation in 1891 telephone service appeared in 1896 and a municipally owned waterworks opened in 1898. By 1896 Paragould had six miles of gravel streets. It was 1912 before downtown streets were paved.""

As the virgin hardwood timber was cleared in surrounding counties Paragould had 14 lumber mills by 1890 and a population of 1666 people. Once the forests were gone land was drained and row-crop agriculture took over on Delta land on either side of Crowley's Ridge. Efforts to attract industry began after World War II. Now Paragould enters a new era as part of the urbanized Jonesboro-Paragould corridor.

CLX,Clorox,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy90aGUtbWFyaWp1YW5hLWNvbXBhbnktdGhhdC1oYXMtamF5LXotYXMtaXRzLWNoaWVmLXZpc2lvbmFyeS1vZmZpY2VyLTE2MjUzMTQyOS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The marijuana company that has Jay-Z as its 'chief visionary officer',"Sometimes it pays to answer those cold messages on LinkedIn.

Just ask Troy Datcher who received a life-changing note last year from a recruiter asking if he’d be interested in joining a brand new marijuana company. Datcher was head of global sales for The Clorox Company (CLX) at the time.

Even though the leap from cleaning supplies to cannabis wasn’t obvious he replied to the message and landed the job – as CEO of The Parent Company which describes itself as the largest vertically integrated omnichannel cannabis company in California.

Datcher has been in the role for just five months and says it’s a steep – but exciting – learning curve.

“I'm learning quite a bit in my new journey here as the chief executive officer of The Parent Company” he told Yahoo Finance. “A lot to learn about the industry a lot to learn about being a CEO and a very incredible dynamic landscape of the cannabis industry as it's forming here in the US.”

Looking to break into the (legal) marijuana business? ‘Reach out’ says CEO of Jay-Z backed cannabis company Troy Datcher.

In fact because everything is new he says his new role is even more challenging than keeping store shelves stocked with Clorox products during a global pandemic – which he says he was ‘well equipped’ to do given his decades of experience.

Jay-Z is in the house

The Parent Company is backed by billionaire entertainer and business mogul Shawn “Jay-Z” Carter who serves as ""chief visionary officer."" It was formed a little more than a year ago and made headlines when it went public on the Canadian NEO Exchange in the largest SPAC cannabis transaction to date. In all The Parent Company houses 17 brands including Jay-Z highly-publicized high-end brand Monogram. It is also the exclusive marijuana partner of Jay-Z’s entertainment powerhouse Roc Nation.

Datcher says the company’s stated objective is to be ‘the most impactful company in the cannabis industry’.

That’s no small goal in a competitive state with complex regulations – not to mention in a country where marijuana is against federal law.

“The biggest challenges are ones that we're all facing as California operators” says Datcher. “There's been a commoditization of flower in the marketplace here which is providing some challenges that are unique to the situation here in California. We've got some regulatory and legislative headwinds here that makes this marketplace a bit unique. And so we're all faced with those.”

Equity is king

Whatever the marketplace challenges Datcher says The Parent Company will never waiver on one thing: its commitment to diversity equity and inclusion (DEI).

“It's much easier to build an industry from the ground up with that intention than it is to retrofit it” he said.

Story continues

To that end The Parent Company has a social equity venture fund that offers capital and mentorship to Black and other minority cannabis entrepreneurs. The fund is led by Jay-Z and Roc Nation CEO Desiree Perez. Seeded with $10 million plus 2 percent of the company’s future net income the fund has already invested in two Black-owned companies.

“Not only do we want to provide safe effective products for the consumers in which we serve but we want to build an industry from the ground up that's more equitable” he says. “That is not just a bottom line top line objective for this organization. But we want to model what it's like to be a great corporate citizen in this new emerging industry.”

The fund’s north star is providing opportunities for building generational wealth and helping right some of the wrongs done to minority communities by the war on drugs. (Study after study shows that people of color have been punished more harshly than white people for drugs offenses.)

“I know people personally— my own family has been impacted by the war on drugs” says Datcher. “I firmly believe that if we can actually build an equitable industry from the ground up from the very beginning we're going to all be proud of the industry that we build because it'll be inclusive and importantly it will allow others to participate in what's going to be a really thriving economy.”

So what’s the first step if you’re interested in breaking into the cannabis industry?

Datcher suggests the same path that got him to his CEO role in the first place: a direct message.

“I'd ask folks that look like me to just inquire about those opportunities. Reach out to people like me” he says. “It's easier to find folks like me today than ever before. I'm my LinkedIn. Search away.”

Troy Datcher CEO of The Parent Company was interviewed for Yahoo Finance's weekly program ""A Time for Change"" which explore issues of race diversity and inclusion in the worlds of finance business politics and beyond.

Market Update,"It has been one hell of a week. The global affairs surrounding Russia and Ukraine have escalated to unexpected levels leaving 40+ million people in fear and extreme danger. The President of Russia Vladimir Putin has shrugged off any type of diplomatic actions and went on to order a full-on invasion attack on Ukraine in every way possible: land air and sea.

As a result the Russian forces initiated a major assault at key military targets and highly dense cities. We observed bomb blasts near the airport in western Ukraine and dozens of tanks marching towards Ukraine’s capital. Now it has been reported that the Ukrainian army destroyed 20 enemy tanks in the Chernihiv region after declaring martial law.

There have been many more horrific instances over the last week that might make you think — are we really going to have world war 3? It is undeniable how bad the situation is right now but we still haven’t seen a first-world country like the United States intervene in any way. They have issued sanctions that would target Russian banks and their ability to make international trades in dollar value.

Along with the US Britain and Europe have taken strict measures to cut-off western financing for Russia. The experts believe these sanctions will have minimal impact in the short term as the Russian state banks reduced exposure to foreign currency. However Russia still has a surplus of $300 billion in offshore accounts. According to Zoltan Pozsar an AG strategist for Credit Suisse the majority of liquid wealth owned by Russia is denominated in U.S. dollars.

So if Russia uses foreign currency to avoid sanctions it would lead to a panic crash that could potentially shift the market structure. And no one would see it coming. In this article we will be diving into the market reactions to the Ukraine-Russia tensions and understand how bad this could turn out to be for an average investor and trader. Read till the end to take action!

How are Markets Reacting

When something like war becomes an everyday topic you know people are panicking and worrying about the future. As a result this fear will reflect directly on markets all across the board. And that is exactly what happened.

We can call it a correction or a panic crash tipped off by the Ukraine-Russia tensions. We must not forget rising interest rates and FED’s announcement about monetary tightening. So the markets were bleeding in a very bad way for weeks now. But when President Putin tore up the peace deal it caused chaos in the global markets. The Indian markets lost nearly 10 lakh crores in value. The S&P 500 also crossed a notable support threshold. It fell to 4155 on 24th February.

Like gold and other commodities the risk-off assets showed great strength with Aluminum hitting a record high and Platinum jumping more than 2%. Gold the most-trusted inflation hedge asset in traditional markets also made massive moves hitting $1973 the highest level it has ever reached since Sept 2020.

As Russia is one of the largest oil producers the war tensions also impacted oil price. The cost per barrel traded above $105 making it the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. Though the markets realized the supply issues are no longer a massive problem and prices fell below $100 there is still uncertainty about how Russia plans to import oil after getting sanctions. Some believe that even if Russia stops importing cross-border dealers will still be selling for much higher prices. So essentially Russia is profiting from their invasion attack.

After the markets settled we observed a relief rally across all markets. The S&P is now well above 4375. And the Indian Sensex is up over 1500 points in a single day.

That is for macro equities and commodities markets. Now let’s get to crypto. We know it’s the most volatile market. If equities fall by 4% crypto-assets fall by 16% (just an estimate). Over the last week major sectors in crypto were hit hard leaving the industry with a $300 billion hole in terms of market cap.

According to Messari the most affected sectors are web 3 blockchain gaming and DeFi. The least affected are currencies smart contract platforms and top cryptocurrencies.

While the market was expecting further downside whales stepped in and placed bids. This initiated a reversal from low 30s to highs. The leading asset that broke out first is Terra. Ethereum and Avalanche also had a major run up after the sudden crash.

What Does On-Chain Say

The market reactions never give us the full picture of what actually happened. To understand that for crypto markets we need to use on-chain metrics. These metrics allow us to check how healthy the bitcoin network is and what the entities are doing in real-time. Let’s see some of the impact-driving metrics.

Open Interest

One of the major factors that caused multiple corrections over the last couple of months is high open interest. When many market participants are trading with high leverage they can easily be liquidated causing extreme volatility. The direction of the volatility cannot be defined as there is a short for every long.

Now the current open interest is still high and very troublesome. Only the late shorts came into existence after Russia’s invasion was crushed. We still need to see these leveraged traders flushed out reducing OI significantly. However that is not what’s happening. Over the last two months the OI has been going down slowly compared to its usual liquidation cascade.

Dry Powder Ratio

Will Clemente an on-chain analyst for Blockware Intelligence put together the following chart representing the dry power ratio. In his tweet Will mentions this ratio is between the amount of stablecoins on exchanges and bitcoin’s market cap. He further says “Dry Power Ratio is at an all-time high this shows there’s a lot of dry power ready to be deployed.”

This is an important metric because it helps us understand how much capital is sitting on the sidelines. Once the markets show signs of relief we may see new capital inflows.

Bitcoin Miners Wallets

When miners sell bitcoin it means that they are unable to bear the cost of mining operations. This kind of activity also initiated a sell off in late 2021. But that’s not the case right now. We are seeing continued growth in miners wallets who are showing conviction and accumulating at these low price points.

Dormancy Flow

The strong hodling behavior displayed by long-term investors can be seen with the help of dormancy flow charts. When a coin is not spent or moved then it is said to be dormant. The more days coins stay dormant the higher their conviction towards that asset. In the case of bitcoin more than 75% of the supply hasn’t moved in at least 6 months. This is a new record. From a network standpoint it is a positive sign but doesn’t mean much in terms of price action.

What should be your action plan

After observing the global affairs and market reactions I hope you understood that there is certainty about uncertainty in the financial markets. Moving forward it is crucial how investors and traders manage their risk profile and make adjusted bets to see continued growth or prevent losses to their portfolio. Let’s look at two scenarios or action plans for the next 12 months or a bear market.

For Traders

People who make a living off trading and never experienced a full market cycle need to have 50% of their capital in stablecoins. The rest should be equally allocated between Ethereum and bitcoin. As we have seen in previous market cycles there will always be a small period of up-only market movements. This mini bull cycle can turn out to be beneficial for traders. At the same time they should also accumulate two or three altcoins that can outperform the entire market. This is not recommended for everyone. It takes high conviction and skill to execute such trades.

For Investors

The best option for investors with a long investment horizon is the dollar cost average. Remember: no one has lost money if they held bitcoin for more than 3 years. So people who have other sources of income and don’t need immediate liquidity can start accumulating fundamentally strong projects. If you want to know which coins can make a strong comeback you can consider technical indicators such as weekly reversal candle structure bullish RSI cross and golden cross.

Everything depends on how this war ends and when

Though this is not another pandemic the markets can react violently if Russia-Ukraine tensions continue to go out of control. We need to closely monitor the situation and understand how it affects global equity markets. Once the equities show strength there is a strong chance crypto will come back. The correlation can only get us so far. We still have to claim back the bull market support band at $53k. There are many high-level resistances that bitcoin needs to overcome to get there.

All in all the markets are looking shaky with rising investor fear. If you are a trader you can leverage short selling to benefit off the downfall. If you are an investor consider accumulating or waiting it out.

THRISSUR: Eminent writer K Satchidanandan  who has been appointed president of the Kerala Sahitya Akademi  said strengthening the bonds between Malayalam and other languages would be one of his top priorities. He said he hoped to leverage his experience and contacts with writers from India and abroad to make this a reality.Satchidanandan said he also hoped to develop the linkages between Malayalam literature and other forms of cultural expressions like performing arts.“Our performing arts including Kathakali Thullal or Opna have all grown in close association with literature. This is true of literature of other Indian states also. So it is important to nurture the inter-arts or intercultural links’’ he said.Satchidanandan who was earlier secretary of Central Sahithya Akademi and editor of Indian Literature is a winner of several awards including Sahitya Akademi Award  Kerala Sahithya Akademi award and Ezhuthachan Puraskaram. The new Akademi office-bearers are likely to take charge on March 9 according to sources.“Making the Akademi contemporary to the digital age is a major programme I hope to undertake. Steps have to be taken to digitise the books. There are numerous old journals some of them published in the 1920s at the Akademi’s Appan Thampuran Memorial centre and their digitisation has to be completed. There are first prints of some of the old books as well books which have become out-of-print at that centre. They also have to be digitised’’ he said.He said the Sahithya Academy journal is coming out reasonably well after the previous secretary K P Mohanan took charge. “But the possibilities of further improving it will be explored. There will also be efforts to make the academy’s publications more focussed and to improve their quality both in terms of content and production” he said.“Most of the literary festivals are now private festivals. I’m also wondering whether the academy can conduct such festivals in a better way. They could even be arranged as cultural festivals by tying up with other academies” he said.Replying to a question Satchidanandan said he was expecting criticism from the Right as well as the extreme Left on his appointment as Sahithya Academy president by the LDF government. “I’m always their victim and so I have no worries about it. I will try to do what I can and let me be judged by what I do without any preconceived notions. They can then condemn or welcome my actions” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL3dvcmxkLW5ld3MvdXMtb3ItcnVzc2lhLXVrcmFpbmUtY3Jpc2lzLXBvc2VzLWRpbGVtbWEtZm9yLXdlYWx0aHktZ3VsZi9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84OTg0NzYzNy5jbXPSAZEBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC93b3JsZC1uZXdzL3VzLW9yLXJ1c3NpYS11a3JhaW5lLWNyaXNpcy1wb3Nlcy1kaWxlbW1hLWZvci13ZWFsdGh5LWd1bGYvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg5ODQ3NjM3LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US or Russia?

Choosing sides in Ukraine's crisis would have once been easy for Gulf states long protected by the US but growing ties with Moscow are forcing them to strike a balance.As the world rushed to condemn the Russian invasion of its smaller neighbour the wealthy Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) have largely kept quiet.Middle East experts say their reticence is understandable given what's at play -- energy money and security.""It is not only the economic ties that are growing but also the security ties of these states with Moscow"" said Anne Gadel a Gulf expert and contributor to the French think-tank Institut Montaigne.On Friday the UAE abstained along with China and India from a vote at the US Security Council demanding Moscow withdraw its troops. Russia as expected vetoed the resolution co-written by the US and Albania while 11 of the council's 15 members voted for it.After the vote Emirati state new agency WAM said the UAE and US foreign ministers spoke by phone to review ""global developments"". No mention was made of Ukraine.Russia's foreign ministry meanwhile announced that the UAE and Russian foreign ministers would meet Monday in Moscow to discuss ""further expanding multifaceted Russia-UAE relations"".Hours before Russia unleashed its massive ground sea and air assault against Ukraine on Thursday the UAE had ""stressed the depth of friendship"" with Moscow.Gulf power house Saudi Arabia has not reacted to the invasion like the UAE Bahrain and Oman. Kuwait and Qatar have only denounced the violence stopping short of criticising Moscow.- 'Ideological ally' - For more than seven decades the United States has played a key role in the conflict-wracked Middle East serving in particular as a defender of the oil-rich Gulf monarchies against potential threats such as Iran.But in recent years Washington began limiting its military engagements in the region even as its closest allies Saudi Arabia and the UAE have come under attack by Yemen's Huthi rebels.Saudi oil giant Aramco's facilities were hit in 2019 by the Iran-aligned insurgents.Gulf countries ""understand that they need to diversify their alliances to compensate for the perceived withdrawal of the United States from the region"" said Gadel.Politics are paramount too.Saudi Arabia and the UAE two US allies hosting American troops have seen their ties with Washington change to a love-hate relationship over arms deals and rights issues.The 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the kingdom's Istanbul consulate has strained relations with Riyadh and the UAE has threatened to cancel a mega-deal for US-made F-35 jet fighters.""Russia is seen as an ideological ally while American human rights strings attached to their support are becoming ever more of an issue"" said Andreas Krieg Middle East expert and associate professor at King's College London.""There has been an integration of grand strategy between Moscow and Abu Dhabi when it comes to the region. Both are counter-revolutionary forces and were eager to contain political Islam.""- 'Tough spot diplomatically' - Despite growing security cooperation with Russia which is directly involved in the Syrian and Libyan conflicts Krieg says most GCC states will ""still put their security eggs into the US basket"".But ""they have started to diversify relations with American competitors and adversaries in other domains"".Trade between Russia and the GCC countries jumped from around $3 billion in 2016 to more than $5 billion in 2021 mostly with the UAE and Saudi Arabia official figures show.The UAE in particular Dubai has been long seen as a magnet for Russian investment and a vacation destination for the Russian elite.As major players in the energy markets most GCC states have a relationship with Russia as fellow producers.Riyadh and Moscow are leading the OPEC+ alliance strictly controlling output to buoy prices in recent years.""Arab members of OPEC are in a tough spot diplomatically as maintaining"" the OPEC+ deal which controls production ""is clearly at the forefront of their considerations"" said Ellen Wald senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think-tank.""Gulf countries fear damaging this relationship and seek to maintain Russian participation in OPEC+... If Russia left the group the entire agreement would probably collapse.""Despite calls by some major oil importers for crude producers to boost supply and help stabilise soaring prices Riyadh the world's top exporter has shown no interest.""Staying silent on Russian action in Ukraine is probably the best course for this at the moment"" Wald said.""But this pragmatic stance may become untenable if pressed on their position by Western leaders.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2NpdHkvcGF0bmEvc3RhdGUtcGxhbnMtdG8tZ2V0LWFkZGwtNjYwN213LXBvd2VyLWJ5LTIwMjItMjMvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODk4NjAwMjUuY21z0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vY2l0eS9wYXRuYS9zdGF0ZS1wbGFucy10by1nZXQtYWRkbC02NjA3bXctcG93ZXItYnktMjAyMi0yMy9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvODk4NjAwMjUuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,State plans to get addl 6607MW power by 2022-23,Patna: The state government last year increased the number of urban local bodies from 149 to 260 implying that the new urban agglomerations (towns) might come up in the near future which will further jack up the demand for power in the domestic sector. The new push being given to industrialization through ethanol production plants and other units is also expected to increase the power demand in the non-domestic sector.“To meet the increased demand for power the state government has already planned for additional capacity of 6607MW from different sources in a phased manner by 2022-23” the Economic Survey Report (ESR) 2021-22 tabled in the state assembly on Friday states indicating the government’s intention to raising the standard of living of people in the state.“Consumption of electricity is one of the yardsticks for measuring the demand of standard of living” the ESR says.As per the ESR the number of towns classified in six types in accordance with their population from less than 5000 to more than one lakh in the state is 199 with 101 of them in north Bihar and 98 in south Bihar.The power availability in the state has been increased from 3500 MW in 2014-15 to 5995 MW in 2020-21 with the growth being by 71%. Incidentally it almost matches with the growth (72.4%) in the per capita consumption of power from 203 kwh to 350 kwh during the same period.As per the 2011 Census the state’s urbanization was 11.3% while on the basis of the projected population of 12.5 crore the urban population is computed to be 1.6 crore. The ESR has noted that the “quantum jump in power demand” has increased on account of new connections universal electrification (total of 1.40 crore connections till 2020-21) increase in agriculture connections wider use of electrical appliances and increase in the quality and hours of power supply (20-22 hours per day in the countryside and 23-24 hours in urban areas).Further there is large variation in district-wise power consumption with the top three districts being Patna (5211 million unit) Gaya (2031 MU) and Muzaffarpur (1444 MU). The three other districts in the same segment are Rohtas (1360 MU) Nalanda (1295 MU) and Bhagalpur (1.079 MU).The three districts at the “bottom end” are Sheohar (115 MU) Arwal (214 MU) and Sheikhpura (247 MU). The three districts which showed the biggest growth in energy demand from 2019-20 to 2020-21 were Buxar (23.5%) Arwal (20.2%) and Araria (20.1%).Clearly in the years to come the power demand in the state is set to increase the ESR has noted adding that the annual energy requirement of the state is expected to be 29835 MU in 2022-23 and 32587 MU in 2023-24.In 2022-23 the major sources from which the state is to get energy for distribution among the consumers are 54 MW from state’s own generating stations 6761 MW from central generating stations and 1618 MW from non-conventional energy (renewable energy) like solar energy.Since the power availability from its own stations has remained fixed at 54 MW and procuring power from central generating stations has been putting pressure on the monetary resources the stress is on using solar energy as an alternative source even in the countryside and recourse to its increased production at the proposed specific solar power plants in the state.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9lY29ub215L2ZpbmFuY2UvaW5kaWFzLW9pbC1pbXBvcnQtYmlsbC10by10b3AtMTAwLWJuLWluLWN1cnJlbnQtZmlzY2FsL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzg5ODY1OTM1LmNtc9IBhAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9lY29ub215L2ZpbmFuY2UvaW5kaWFzLW9pbC1pbXBvcnQtYmlsbC10by10b3AtMTAwLWJuLWluLWN1cnJlbnQtZmlzY2FsL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84OTg2NTkzNS5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India's oil import bill to top $100 bn in current fiscal,"

India's crude oil import bill is set to exceed $100 billion in the current fiscal year ending March 31 almost double its spending last year as international oil prices trade at seven-year highs. India spent $94.3 billion in the first 10 months (April-January) of the ongoing financial year that started April 1 2021 according to data from the oil ministry's Petroleum Planning & Analysis Cell (PPAC).It spent USD 11.6 billion in January alone when oil prices had started to surge. This compared with USD 7.7 billion spending in the same month last year.In February oil prices crossed USD 100 per barrel and going at this rate India which imports 85 per cent of its crude oil requirements is expected to almost double its import bill to USD 110-115 billion by the end of the fiscal year 2021-2022.The imported crude oil is turned into value-added products like petrol and diesel at oil refineries before being sold to automobiles and other users. India has surplus refining capacity and it exports some petroleum products but is short on production of cooking gas LPG which is imported from nations like Saudi Arabia.Import of petroleum products in April-January of 2021-22 fiscal was 33.6 million tonnes worth USD 19.9 billion. On the other hand 51.1 million tonnes of petroleum products were also exported for USD 33.4 billion.India had spent USD 62.2 billion on import of 196.5 million tonnes of crude oil in the previous 2020-21 fiscal when global oil prices remained subdued in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.In the current year it has already imported 175.9 million tonnes of crude oil.In the pre-pandemic 2019-20 fiscal the world's third largest energy importing and consuming nation had spent USD 101.4 billion on import of 227 million tonnes of crude oil.Brent spot prices surged to an over seven-year high of USD 105.58 per barrel on February 24 on fears of supply disruptions after Russia invaded Ukraine. It has dropped to below USD 100 thereafter as those fears receded as the West kept energy trade out of sanctions imposed on Russia.Higher crude oil import bill is expected to dent the macroeconomic parameters.The country's import dependence has increased owing to a steady decline in domestic output. The nation produced 30.5 million tonnes of crude oil in 2019-20 which fell to 29.1 million tonnes in the following year.During the current fiscal it has produced 23.8 million tonnes of crude oil so far as compared to 24.4 million in the first 10 months of 2020-21. The target for 2021-22 is 26.1 million tonnes the PPAC data showed.India's self-sufficiency in meeting oil needs was 15 per cent in 2019-20 which increased to 15.6 per cent in the following fiscal but has fallen to 14.9 per cent in the current financial year.India's import bill for liquefied natural gas (LNG) also increased to USD 9.9 billion during the 10-month period of the current fiscal significantly higher than USD 6.2 billion worth of imports during the same period in the previous fiscal year the PPAC data showed.Global LNG prices have spiralled during the past few months leading to costlier gas imports.In 2020-21 India spent USD 7.9 billion on import of 33 billion cubic metres of LNG. In the previous fiscal it spent USD 9.5 billion on import of 33.88 bcm.In the current fiscal India imported 26.78 bcm of gas majority of it on long-term contracts linked to oil prices.Petronet LNG Ltd imports gas in its liquid form (LNG) from Qatar and Australia while state-owned GAIL (India) Ltd has long-term import contracts from Russia and the US."

These days the need for recyclable and reusable packaging is becoming more and more apparent. In recent years Coca-Cola Japan has been making attempts to make their products more eco-friendly such as removing the plastic labelling from drinks and reducing the amount of electricity needed to run their vending machines.

Their latest campaign comes off the back of an announcement made by the Coca-Cola Company to make 25 percent of its packaging globally to be reusable by 2030. Reusable packaging includes returnable glass bottles refillable PET bottles or selling products through traditional fountain or Coca-Cola dispensers.

In order to help achieve this goal Coca Cola Japan have been working on a project called the Bon Aqua Water Bar. The Bon Aqua Water Bar is a self-serve water dispenser that offers users five different kinds of water — cold water room temperature water hot water and carbonated water (strong and weak).

▼ The Water Bar encourages people to use their own containers such as drinks bottles.

Users can fill any bottle with purified water from the machine for 60 yen (US$0.52) a time. For those without a drink bottle on hand paper cups are available for 70 yen ($0.61) and come in two sizes  medium (240 milliliters [8.1 ounces] or large (430 milliliters).

Specialized 380-millilitre Bon Aqua drinks bottles are also available for 260 yen (which includes the water inside) and are the only usable bottles if you want to get carbonated water from the machine.

The Coca-Cola Company hopes that Bon Aqua Water Bar will make drinking purified water affordable without consumers having to worry about plastic pollution. The Water Bar was piloted in December last year at Universal Studios Japan and is currently being tested at Tiger Corporation in Osaka.

Fingers crossed the project helps Coca Cola move closer to their goal of less plastic pollution. If not though they can always employ the assistance of a Titan or two to get people recycling.

Read the WPP chief executive admitted he was concerned about the “terrible news” from Ukraine where 200 people work for WPP agencies and the parent company is providing financial assistance and other support to them.

He was speaking to Campaign after WPP reported annual results that beat expectations with 12.1% organic growth in revenue less pass-through costs in 2021 – near the top of the global agency peer group – after an 8.4% decline in 2020.

In another sign of recovery WPP added 9500 jobs as global headcount increased to 109400 more than making up for the loss of 6500 jobs a year earlier and will pay £592m in staff bonuses – double pre-pandemic levels.

However WPP’s share price fell sharply despite a broadly positive response from analysts as the results were published on the same morning that Russian forces entered Ukraine.

You have called 2021 a “marquee year” and an “outstanding year”. Did you underestimate the recovery because you have blown past some of your targets – for example hitting the 2023 revenue target two years early?

There’s no doubt that the economic recovery has been stronger than people expected and WPP has benefitted from that – like other companies. But more importantly the results reflect the strength of our business in areas like digital marketing media ecommerce data and technology where clients are spending more money.

They obviously reflect our new-business wins in 2020 and 2021 when we had a strong performance as well as levels of confidence by clients in investing in marketing as economies reopened and they seek to transform their business. We have upgraded [forecasts] three times during the year and I think it is a very strong performance.

WPP’s results have come out on the same day as Russian forces went into Ukraine. What’s the impact on the company and any of your staff in the region?

We all woke up to the terrible news and we are watching it unfold in front of us. Clearly it’s too early to tell the economic impact of what’s happening in Ukraine – terrible though it is.

We have about 200 people in Ukraine – Wunderman Thompson Ogilvy VMLY&R Group M and Hill & Knowlton all have people there. We have about 1200 people in Russia as well.

We have been making contingency plans and helping people with financial support and the ability to relocate if they want and other forms of assistance including advancing them additional financial resources. It’s safe to say people there are shocked by what has happened.

To what extent as the biggest agency group are you gravitating more towards bigger clients such as Coca-Cola? Is that the way that WPP can turn the dial on growth by building bigger relationships with mega-clients? I am thinking of your top 10 clients who were worth an average of $170m each in annual revenue before the pandemic.

We have to be able to work with the biggest global companies as well as smaller and more innovative businesses – companies that want to build brands and reach consumers no matter what their size. Part of the strategy has to be to grow our business with small innovative digital companies that will be big companies of the future. At the same time there’s no doubt that major global marketers are looking to simplify how they work with their partners and to build bigger and stronger strategic partnerships. And we’ve been a beneficiary of that.

If I look back on our new-business record and I take three wins – Coca-Cola Google and Unilever – we should be proud of the fact that WPP is working with three of the world’s largest marketers on critical issues to their growth and future success.

In your annual results presentation to investors (see image above) you talk about the importance of becoming Coca-Cola’s main integrated marketing partner across all of its creative media data and more. How transformational is the Coca-Cola expansion? And what impact might it have on WPP – as an example to other clients and to your staff?

It is a very transformational move by them to seek to find a partner who can help them change how they market. If you think about The Coca-Cola Company it is a company based on strategic partnerships – look at their relationships with bottlers. And to some extent they’re seeking the same relationship with a single partner who can help them transform their marketing but they also realise they need to have the very best creative ideas.

We went through a very rigorous process where they tested us in every respect – how we would do creatively the strength of our data offer our ability to build and help them reinforce big strategic partnerships with the major technology companies on a global basis –as they operate in 200 countries around the world.

What we’re building for them is in many respects a model for the future of client-agency partnership and it gives our people the ability to work with fantastic brands and come up with big ideas that resonate around the world. The Lunar New Year work [produced by Ogilvy Shanghai and featuring a mobile game a limited-edition line of collectible cans animated 3D billboards and non-fungible tokens (NFTs)] is a good example of the work that has come out of the partnership and how it’s working.

You added 9500 jobs in 2021 which is a sign of strength. But was it an error to cut more than 6000 roles in 2020? And how challenging is it to recruit so many people?

If you look back at our response to the pandemic in its early stages [in 2020] we took a lot of steps to limit the number of people that we did cut and our revenues were down 8.4% versus the headcount decline [of about 6%]. We were consciously trying to mitigate the number of job reductions that we made like shorter working weeks the voluntary salary sacrifices that we then repaid [subsequently].

Coming to 2021 our net sales were up 12% and our headcount is up 9% and we’re seeing growth in new areas [some of which are different from the areas where there were redundancies]. I feel we did what we could to protect the business and mitigate that impact.

The talent market is very competitive and people have options. It’s why making WPP an attractive place to work the focus we’re placing on employee wellness on more flexible ways of working on our campuses on training and development on career opportunities across the group are so important.

How is the campus strategy working? If we take London as an example you’ve just moved Grey Mindshare and other agencies into a second campus building Rose Court. You’ve got some very big buildings – many of which you committed to pre pandemic. Frankly do you really need all the space you have committed to?

We have reduced our space significantly. We’re moving from 38 buildings in London to three over a five-year period and as part of that we will be consolidating our space. I think our campuses are exactly what we need for the future. They are buildings that are very flexible in terms of how we accommodate people. They have much more co-working space they are dynamic lively environments we have activities going on that provide people with a reason to come into the office.

When I walked around Sea Containers [WPP’s London headquarters] yesterday we had 1100 people – it felt like a buzzy energetic place to work and somewhere where people look forward to coming in. There are savings that we can make in our property portfolio [by reducing more space in future] but absolutely this [shared space for multiple agencies] is the right thing to do – to provide the type of workplace where people want to come into work.

We will probably create more co-working space and less dedicated space [allocated to specific people]. We need to have space for people to have meetings and Zooms. We’re rapidly reconfiguring our space for the future ways of working. I don’t think we’re going to go to the future where everyone works from the office all of the time or indeed everyone works from home all of the time. It’s going to be a balance.

What proportion of people are coming in?

Probably 50% [in Sea Containers] – we were never at 100% even before the pandemic because people go to client meetings and we have a lot of visitors. The picture varies very much around the world. In Taiwan we’re at 95% occupancy in China we’re 70% at the US we’re at a lot less than in the UK.

With WPP forecasting revenue growth of 5% in 2022 are you hiring maybe at 3% or 4%? You are now 109000 people so are we talking about hiring 4000 this year?

Probably somewhere in that range. It’s what our budgets would indicate now.

In terms of salary inflation WPP’s pay rises were quite low globally before the pandemic – average base salary increases were less than 2% a year. What are you going to do about salary inflation in 2022 in a market where consumer inflation is running at more like 5%?

2020 was a tough year in terms of increases. We paid more than average in 2021. And I think we are going to likely pay more on average in 2022 – the average across the board might be 4% but it’s going to vary from position to position and role to role.

You talk at considerable length about the importance of ESG and sustainability in the annual results. And you obviously think it matters – despite some investors saying your clients have “lost the plot” on sustainability messaging? And linked to that how sustainable is it for WPP to send lots of people to Cannes Lions?

We did an excellent commercial in the Super Bowl for [Unilever’s] Hellmann’s highlighting its role in reducing waste. Consumers do want purpose at the heart of their brands – the Hellmann’s work was I think voted the number two ad of the Super Bowl. I think we can build purpose into our work in a way that resonates with consumers.

So far as Cannes is concerned we would like it to be a hybrid event – to take fewer people there but to enable more of our people to experience it digitally at the same time. There are many ways in which we should be able to connect people with the event digitally and we would encourage the organisers to find more and more ways to allow people who can’t be there to experience it virtually.

We will take fewer people from WPP in 2022 than we did in 2019. It’s still an important event and it’s important to recognise creativity but we can do that both in-person and virtually.

Looking ahead you say you are confident despite the squeeze on the cost of living because of inflation and now Ukraine?

Clearly events in Ukraine are concerning. I don’t think today’s a day to think through what the medium- and longer-term impact is going to be on the global economy. From a direct perspective it’s a really small part of WPP’s business. Notwithstanding that the [global] economy is recovering from the pandemic.

The inflationary pressures in the economy are a result of very strong consumer demand and clients are looking to invest in their brand to mitigate that. Clients are cautious but they are also keen to maintain their marketing investment to the greatest degree possible and that gives us confidence going into the year.

Take a step back and think about WPP and our journey over the last few years and we do think the company is in a much better competitive position. If you go back three years ago to this set of results [the first that Read presented after taking over as CEO] the company hadn’t grown in more than two years our biggest client [Ford] had been up for review and our debt was approaching £5bn.

We come into 2022 with a company that is growing above the peer group average where we’ve just won the largest review of 2021 and our balance sheet and financial health is extremely strong which gives us opportunity to invest in the business both organically and through acquisition and return cash to shareholders. We feel we’re in a strong position for the year overall."

The team had enjoyed a moderately successful opening two days of the official shakedown test with drivers Lance Stroll and Sebastian Vettel completing a combined total of 296 laps. It was the German who got the team’s sole running on the final day before an oil leak resulted in a small fire on the AMR22. Understandably the team stood no chance of any further running.

Despite the late setback Vettel is glad to have had the time to get to know the AMR22 the Four-Time World Champion is looking forward to continuing this process in Bahrain.

“It has been a useful few days and we have learned a lot about the AMR22 although we like all the other teams still have a lot more to learn considering that we are all dealing with a brand-new generation of Formula One cars.

“Even so my first impression of the AMR22 has been relatively positive so I am really looking forward to working with the team to take further forward steps in Bahrain. It was a shame to end the day with an issue but we have completed many laps so we can be happy with our work this week.”

“We have already learned a lot” – Lance Stroll

Due to the fire Stroll was unable to run on the final day of the three day test for the team the Canadian did however complete plenty of mileage across the first two days. Stroll was disappointed to miss out running on the final day but recognises the team are on an enormous learning curve.

“It was a shame not to complete any laps this afternoon but it has been great to be back behind the wheel of a Formula One car. We have already learned a lot about the AMR22 which is important because the cars are so different this year.

“It is a whole new philosophy to understand so we are working through how these cars like to be set up and driven. We are on a big learning curve now like all the teams and the goal is to continue to make progress in Bahrain in the next test and we will still be doing so in the early races too.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMi9hd2FyZHMvbmV3cy9hcmlhbmEtZGVib3NlLXNhZy13aW5uZXItbGF0aW5hLTEyMzUxODYwMDQv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly92YXJpZXR5LmNvbS8yMDIyL2F3YXJkcy9uZXdzL2FyaWFuYS1kZWJvc2Utc2FnLXdpbm5lci1sYXRpbmEtMTIzNTE4NjAwNC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ariana DeBose on Being First Latina SAG Film Actress Winner: ‘Doors Are Opening’,"Ariana DeBose is now in the SAG Awards record books.

After winning SAG’s best supporting actress award for her performance as Anita in Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story” DeBose is now the first Latina to win a film award from the guild along with being the first queer woman of color to be recognized for acting.

“It’s indicative that doors are opening” DeBose told reporters in the virtual backstage media room. “It’s an honor to an Afro Latina queer women of color and a dancer and a singer and an actor.”

DeBose said that she is cognizant of the importance of the firsts that she is notching for Afro Latino actors” but equally significant to her is the sign that “it’s indicative that I will not be the last. That’s the important part. Whatever firsts are attached to my name they’re important to me but I’m focused on the fact that if I’m the first of anything it means I will not be the last.”

DeBose also pointed to her forerunners in playing “West Side Story’s” Anita on stage and screen Chita Rivera and Rita Moreno. She called it an honor to join their ranks. The legacy of the role “includes both Chita and Rita and now Ariana and it’s really special to me. And we’re all very different types of Latinas. There’s not one way to be Latina or Hispanic. There are many beautiful ways and each and every one of us is testament to that.”

On the film side much like other awards shows there hasn’t been a plethora of Latino nominees at the SAG Awards. Salma Hayek in “Frida” (2002) and Catalina Sandino Moreno in “Maria Full of Grace” (2004) were the only Latinas represented in the lead actress film categories.

In supporting actress the two noms for Cameron Diaz for “Being John Malkovich” (1999) and “Vanilla Sky” (2001) Adriana Barraza for “Babel” (2006) and Jennifer Lopez for “Hustlers” (2019) along with DeBose are the representation for Latinas. Only Barraza and DeBose’s SAG noms have translated to Oscars attention.

DeBose’s co-star Moreno became the first and still only Latina to ever win an acting Oscar for the 1961 original version where she also played the dancing seamstress. In the remake she plays the newly created role of Valentina. If DeBose wins the Oscar she would become the second Latina to win an acting Oscar.

DeBose noted that the SAG Awards in-person gathering gave her a chance to indulge herself on the first large-scale red carpet in more than two years. DeBose said she had a memorable encounter on the carpet outside Barker Hangar with one of her idols Lady Gaga. “That was my fangirl moment. Not gonna apologize for it. I stand by it” DeBose said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZtb250aGx5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3BnYS10b3VyLXByby1hY2hpZXZlcy1yYXJlLWZlYXQtYXJvdW5kLXBnYS1uYXRpb25hbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PGA Tour Pro Achieves Rare Feat Around PGA National,"At the Honda Classic on Friday one PGA Tour professional achieved something that only a few will ever do in their lifetime hit all 18 greens in regulation.

Not only did Adam Svensson produce a ball striking masterclass around PGA National but also achieved a feat that only Cody Gribble had ever managed since the event was moved to the course in 2007.

A post shared by PGA TOUR (@pgatour) A photo posted by on

As well as hitting all 18 greens the 28-year-old also missed just one fairway as the Canadian signed for a five-under-par 65 to sit comfortably inside the top-10.

Speaking after his second round Svensson said: ""I hit the ball pretty good especially the driver. There's a lot of tight holes out there and I think I hit 17 -- well almost all the fairways besides 1. But yeah I hit the irons great made a couple nice putts and I didn't even know I hit all 18 greens until Tim my caddie told me and I was like Wow okay.""

PGA National is famed for the Bear Trap which is regarded as one of the toughest three-hole stretches of golf on the PGA Tour. During the first round of this year's event the field was a combined 61-over-par on the par 3 par 4 par 3 layout with Svensson himself three-over on the first day.

However on Friday the 28-year-old would tame it superbly playing the stretch in one-under-par and gaining a shedload of shots on the field. ""I was 3-over par yesterday on them"" said Svensson. ""I had a nice round going and then I ended up going double bogey bogey but today I was like let's just calm down and produce nice smooth swings and I mean I just hit some really good shots in there.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBsYW5ldGYxLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FzdG9uLW1hcnRpbi1kaWZmaWN1bHQtZXhwYW5zaW9uLXByb2Nlc3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Andy Green: Aston Martin's expansion is ""a difficult process to manage""","Aston Martin chief technical officer Andrew Green says the team’s staff expansion is a “difficult process” as a new structure takes shape.

He said Aston Martin want to keep the mentality at the team of punching above its weight with the Silverstone squad having garnered a reputation for outperforming their resources over the years.

But team owner Lawrence Stroll has worked hard to expand the team’s workforce by around 200 people in total committed to building a new factory and has grand plans to build Aston Martin up to match the biggest teams in the sport in the ongoing development race in Formula 1.

While adding staff brings its benefits Green admitted building the new car alongside the team bringing in personnel has made it an “intense” off-season for them.

“We are trying to expand trying to get ourselves aligned on our ambitions for our five-year plan so expansion is a difficult process to manage as well” Green explained to reporters including PlanetF1.

“It needs managing. It takes resource away from what would usually be pure development so all in all it has been a really challenging year – the most intense winter I’ve ever experienced.

Fun in the sun. ☀️ pic.twitter.com/1EtqtPVUCC — Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team (@AstonMartinF1) February 24 2022

“I’m really glad and proud of what we have achieved as a team to get this car ready.”

The new regulations have been a challenge for every team to navigate over the past couple of years with Haas even foregoing the opportunity to develop their 2021 car by putting their entire focus on being as prepared as possible for the 2022 season ahead.

Green has been a long-standing presence in Formula 1 and feels the amount of effort going into the new cars is completely justified given how much of the car has changed.

“Oh by far the biggest change in regulations I think the sport has ever seen” said Green when asked about how the new regulations fare against what has come before. “My career goes back to 1991.

“It trumps everything from ’91 I think it trumps everything as far as F1 is concerned. It’s a completely new concept and a completely different way of approaching a regulation as well. It’s been a massive challenge.

“It’s been exciting for sure. There is so much to do so much to learn and we are only just starting this exploration of the regulations. We have really only been looking at them and developing since January last year so we haven’t had a lot of time.

“When you think we started in January last year the first time the wind tunnel runs and development started then we had to be releasing a chassis six months later.

“So it really was intense. It was a lot of work and then you’re trying to combine that with trying to compete in the season last year as well which made things even harder.”"

You purchase credits equal to the amount of plastic waste you produce and the PCX invests those credits to offset your activity. Yes the concept does borrow from carbon offset programs but it differs in its fundamentals transparency and execution according to PCX founder Nanette Medved-Po.

Carbon is abstract she explains hard to quantify and for most people difficult to grasp in a transactional context. Plastic on the other hand is tangible. It’s easier to get your head around the notion of a ton of plastic— “offsetting” that to balance out your plastic footprint does not require a leap in conceptual thinking.

PCX is explicit in how those credits are used as shown in the graphic below.

PCX also partners with local communities to collect plastic waste prioritizing women micro-entrepreneurs through its Aling Tindera waste-to-cash program in low-income countries. The program began in the Philippines one of the countries in Asia/Pacific that has been hit especially hard by plastic pollution and lacks resources to effectively manage it.

All credits and offsets are registered on a blockchain ledger to ensure transparency and traceability states PCX. It partners with auditing firms PWC and EY to ensure end-to-end transparency and it has worked with companies like PepsiCo Nestlé and Colgate-Palmolive in the Philippines. Late last year it launched its program in the United States.

Macro Magnetics LLC formed in January by Wyoming-based RoMan Manufacturing Inc. paid $2 million to acquire the assets of Grand Power Systems Inc. a former portfolio company of Grand Rapids private equity firm Blackford Capital. The court-supervised sale came after Blackford Capital agreed with Comerica last September to move Grand Power Systems into receivership.

“We’re really excited about the opportunity and looking to restore what it’s capable of” said Robert Roth president and CEO of RoMan Manufacturing which intends to rebrand Grand Power Systems as Macro Magnetics.

On Jan. 21 Ottawa County Circuit Court Judge Jon Van Allsburg approved the sale of Grand Power Systems’ assets which was led by Chicago-based advisory firm and court-appointed receiver Finnea Group LLC. The sale closed Jan. 24.

The acquisition includes machinery equipment tooling intellectual property inventory and accounts receivables Roth said.

Comerica and Grand Power Systems’ principal customers also supported the sale to RoMan Manufacturing according to court documents. Finalizing and closing the sale quickly was critical to allowing Grand Power Systems to continue operating Finnea Group’s attorneys wrote in the court filing which showed the company operated at a loss during the receivership.

Without an expeditious closing the receiver would have been forced to “move to an orderly liquidation” of Grand Power Systems resulting in a “significantly decreased return” to Comerica supply chain disruptions for customers and the loss of jobs Finnea Group’s attorneys wrote. Selling Grand Power Systems to RoMan Manufacturing was “in the best interests” to all parties according to court documents.

Grand Power Systems had been struggling “for a whole variety” of reasons including an unsuccessful add-on acquisition COVID-19 higher labor costs and inflation all of which led the private equity firm to decide against putting more capital into the business Blackford Capital founder and CEO Martin Stein told MiBiz.

Receivership was the “least expensive and most collaborative option of all of the options” to pursue for Grand Power Systems Stein said.

“From 2014 until 2021 we put lots of love and attention and capital into the business and the reality is that some companies don’t perform as you’d expect” Stein said. “We had to make a decision as to whether or not we were going to continue to pour investor capital into Grand Power Systems and we chose not to do that.”

The situation was the first time a company that Blackford Capital acquired ended up in receivership out of nearly 50 transactions over the last decade Stein added.

‘We understood the business’

The family-owned RoMan Manufacturing a Wyoming-based producer of industrial transformers was an investor in Grand Power Systems and a trade creditor. RoMan Manufacturing “was very much aware of the struggles … although extremely disappointed in the way it turned out as far as the business having to go into receivership” Roth said.

The opportunity to buy the assets came when Finnea Group approached RoMan Manufacturing given the company’s familiarity with Grand Power Systems said Roth who chaired the board at Grand Power under Blackford Capital’s ownership.

“We understood the business” he said.

The deal made strategic sense because RoMan Manufacturing specializes in water-cooled industrial transformers while Grand Power Systems specializes in air-cooled transformers. RoMan Manufacturing previously “just never felt compelled to make all of the investment” needed to produce air-cooled transformers Roth said.

Acquiring Grand Power Systems is “a great fit” that rounds out RoMan Manufacturing’s product lineup he said.

“There was always a part of the market that we couldn’t supply” Roth said. “But now this is a way where the combined companies allow us to have this broader product portfolio and all the times we’ve had to say ‘no’ to customers in the past … now we can say ‘yes’” Roth said.

RoMan Manufacturing initially intends to focus on getting Grand Power Systems “back to basics” Roth added.

Grand Power Systems targets $7 million in revenues for 2022 about half of what it once generated Roth said. A business plan for the company seeks to restore revenues to 75 percent to 80 percent of past sales levels in the second year and “by year three we ought to be able to be right back to where they were on a real solid footing with a strong balance sheet” he said.

“Obviously any company that goes into receivership is not in good shape” Roth said. “They have a great product portfolio (and) there’s a great group of people that have worked at this business that know how to do the work but so much else of the company has been pretty damaged. It’s blocking and tackling. It’s really just getting focused on some core customers.”

Core clients that include Rockwell International Otis Worldwide Corp. and Toshiba Corp. who were “extremely supportive” of the asset sale and restarting the business provide “a base of customers right out of the gate” for Grand Power Systems he said. Wes MacAllister a longtime manufacturing executive now leads Grand Power’s day-to-day operations.

Case resolution

Grand Power’s sale ended a case that began Sept. 10 2021 when Comerica filed claims in Ottawa County Circuit Court against four subsidiaries of Blackford Capital — GTI Power Acquisition LLC Warner Power Acquisition LLC Warner Properties LLC and GTI Consolidation LLC — for breaching debt agreements.

Investors who joined with Blackford Capital affiliate BFC-GTI LLC to invest in the company as limited partners won’t receive any return on their investment Stein said.

“Everything is fine with Comerica (and) everything will be fine with the business going forward. The group that really ended up losing out in this was Blackford and our limited partners” he said.

A regulatory filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicates that 24 investors invested a combined $1 million in BFC-GTI in 2020. BFC-GTI initially raised $3.45 million in an equities offering six years earlier that involved 55 investors according to a March 2014 SEC filing.

Blackford Capital acquired the former Grand Transformers Inc. in February 2014 from Greg and Jerry Retzlaff the sons of K.C. Retzlaff who started the business in 1948. At the time of the transaction Grand Power Systems employed 70 people at its 55000-square-foot leased facility on Grand Haven’s east side.

The company today has 24 production and administrative employees Roth said. A quarterly status report that Finnea Group filed with the court in December noted that key staff — including the CEO chief financial officer controller human resources director and operations personnel — had left the company.

Under Blackford Capital’s ownership Grand Transformers in 2016 bought Warner N.H.-based Warner Power a designer and manufacturer of electrical transformers and power systems from Bethesda Md.-based private equity firm American Capital Strategies Ltd.

Warner Power had been “declining for 20 years and was on the verge of bankruptcy” and had struggled under American Capital Strategies’ ownership Stein said. Blackford Capital was unable to turn around Warner Power as anticipated and the company became a drain “on the entire organization” Stein said.

“That management team didn’t work out the product lines continued to decline” as industry technology evolved “and the business never fully integrated” he said. “The synergies that had been initially modeled didn’t end up transpiring and the organization had additional leverage as a result of that.”

Blackford Capital has since improved due diligence and internal processes Stein said. The private equity firm has held companies that struggled but none that went to receivership.

“I can’t say that this will never happen again but I can say that we will ensure that we do everything possible so that at the outset we are buying the right businesses with the right management teams and providing them the right capital structures so that they can be successful” he said.

The sale of Grand Power Systems’ assets also included equipment machinery and inventory at the Warner Power facility in New Hampshire but not the real estate Roth said. Operations at Warner Power ceased prior to the Comerica court case and Grand Power Systems going into receivership he said.

Production that was done in New Hampshire will move to RoMan Manufacturing’s facility in Wyoming.

Since the prepaid card’s arrival more than 20 years ago numerous industry participants have experienced high-profile snafus.

The latest is Bank of America which is under investigation by federal banking regulators in connection with its role as the exclusive provider of prepaid debit cards to recipients of government benefits in California.

Both at BofA and elsewhere in the prepaid industry the exploitation of cards by fraudsters has sometimes caused headaches. Other problems stemmed from technology glitches that temporarily prevented cardholders from accessing their money.

Could the idea be making a comeback? (Getty Images)

It began in Ravenswood on the western end of Queens. That’s where Con Ed the New York City and Westchester utility planned to construct a nuclear power facility.

Next time you’re on the overpass of the Long Island Expressway before the Queens Midtown Tunnel look to the right — to the north — and you will see smokestacks of conventional power plants. That’s where Con Ed planned to also go nuclear.

The utility applied to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission in 1962 for a construction license. The Long Island Press in 1963 quoted from an AEC document which stated “that a reactor such as Consolidated Edison plans” should be 13.7 miles “from the nearest boundary of a densely populated place.”

And said the Press “Considering that the Ravenswood site is almost smack in the geographic center of New York City with its teeming millions…opposition to it is understandable to say the least.”

And was there opposition. Challengers of the project appeared before the City Council supporting a bill barring the building of nuclear plants within city limits. The measure wasn’t passed but its introduction resulted in Con Ed dropping the project in 1964. Two years later the push for nuclear shifted to Long Island.

“Mineola L.I.: — The use of atomic energy to produce electricity for Long Island was moved a big step forward as the Long Island Lighting Company today announced that it had initiated proceedings with local authorities to rezone a portion of a site on the north shore of Suffolk County for the Company’s first nuclear electric generating station” said a LILCO press release dated April 13 1966.

It turned out that LILCO wanted to build not one but three nuclear power plants at Shoreham four to the east at Jamesport and several in between all along the Long Island Sound.

A total of seven to 11 nuclear power plants were proposed. Eastern Long Island was to become what nuclear promoters described as a “nuclear power park” said Riverhead attorney Tom Twomey quoting a federal study. Twomey became a key attorney fighting nuclear power on Long Island.



It took more than two grassroot organizations and local and state government actions to end the plan. Shoreham was shut down and dismantled as a nuclear facility. None of the other proposed plants were built. Long Island is now nuclear-free.

Or is it?

The Long Island Power Authority which replaced LILCO with a mission to promote green energy still holds an 18% interest in the Nine Mile Point Unit 2 nuclear power plant upstate — despite efforts through the years by safe-energy activists for it to divest from Nine Mile Point Unit 2.

And LIPA CEO Tom Falcone during a LIPA board meeting in December spoke about future sources of energy and said electricity would play a much greater role. He referred to solar and wind power and added “We’re going to have nuclear in the future.”

It’s been a very long battle for green energy on Long Island. It’s not over yet.

We find the series 'Issu du feu' with its famous paintings made with pieces of charcoal; 'Landscape' defined by these large abstract landscapes radically separated into two spaces one white the other black; 'Untitled' composed of canvases designed with charcoal ink and acrylic medium. And we discover two new series never before shown in France: the first 'Brushstroke' composed of large-scale papers from which emerge shapes painted in charcoal ink; and the second 'Issu du feu (White lines)' characterised by pieces of charcoal on canvas topped with small white lines.

The ensemble reminds and highlights that—whatever the medium the techniques the disciplines—Lee Bae's work since its beginnings in 1990 affirms the same purpose: the quest for black. Black in all its states in all its forms in all its lights in all its depths and even sometimes in its reflections.

In 'Issu du feu' black—the blacks we should say as Lee Bae represents their range from deep black to almost light gray—evoked by the multiple pieces of charcoal that the artist juxtaposes and sticks together reveals itself under multiple facets: he plays with its shine with it iridescent effects with its pearly aspects born from the impression of movements on the surface.

In 'Untitled' it is the opposite: black is shown in its depths born from the density of the charcoal ink used to draw shapes and heightened by the contrast with the white surfaces that define their outlines. Like a black hole the tones of black pull the eye into endless perspectives—a call that we also feel with the 'Landscape' series whose radical geometric compositions sometimes like cliff edges create an echo between black and white to further intensify their juxtaposition.

In his recent large works on paper Lee Bae puts movement in his blacks and deploys the gradations of their transparency. Contrary to the 'Untitled' series where each shape is meticulously drawn several times superimposed in Brushstroke each shape or symbol drawn in charcoal ink is the result of a single gesture without possibility of remorse and of an absolute brilliance that combines both mental concentration and corporeal control. Close to calligraphy this writing which in its way relates to a traditional method testifies at the same time to a highly contemporary spirit and an immanent touch and presence.

For 'Issu du feu (White lines)' Lee Bae resumes his compositions with pieces of charcoal but he forms a pattern and punctuates them on the surface with small lines in white oil pastel like commas on a blackboard. In this way he puts black in the background and gives it even more perspective.

Finally in his installations always made with burnt wood or charcoal Lee Bae puts black in relief. He puts it in a ball in a bundle or in a point to show that black can also be perceived as modeled as protuberance. And that whatever its aspect this color with its innumerable nuances allows him to speak about time space energy body soul. And thus about life.

The three leaders used the money they stole to live a lavish lifestyle that included buying homes purchasing vehicles and taking luxury vacations according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Sacramento.

John A. Crosby 56 of Redding and two other former officials of the Paskenta Band of Nomlaki Indians Ines S. Crosby 76 of Orland and Leslie A. Lohse 67 of Glenn pleaded guilty in 2019 of embezzling from the tribe.

Between the three of them they stole nearly $5 million from the tribe which operates Rolling Hills Casino near Corning.

“The defendants lived a lavish lifestyle at the expense of the Paskenta Tribe of Nomlaki Indians and were undeterred by the damage their conduct would bring to the Tribe whose members trusted them with most of their crucial operational positions” said U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert whose office prosecuted the case in federal court.

John Crosby was sentenced to four years and nine months in prison He was also ordered to pay a $10000 fine. Ines Crosby was sentenced to four years and nine months in prison. Lohse was sentenced to three years and five months in prison. Lohse has paid $902208 in restitution according to the U.S. Attorney's office.

A hearing was scheduled for April 19 2022 to determine how much restitution John and Ines Crosby will pay officials said.

The embezzlement happened between January 2009 and May 2014 with the defendants ""taking advantage of their positions on the tribal council and in prominent leadership positions in the tribe"" officials said.

According to court documents the defendants used the money they stole to buy a home vehicles trips to Africa South America Hawaii a World Series game and the Dominican Republic.

Some of the money also was used on private jets family expenses ""precious metals"" and more the U.S. Attorney's Office said. Per court documents some of the expenses that used tribal money include:

Over $838000 for John Crosby to buy a house.

Over $150000 for John Crosby to buy gold coins and precious metals.

About $85000 for Ines Crosby to have a koi pond installed at her home.

A $1155 purse $2000 in beauty products and a car that cost over $93000 for Ines Crosby.

Trips on private jets worth over $100000 each for both Ines and John Crosby.

Over $30000 in credit card payments from Lohse.

The patent is for an Apple keyboard device that is essentially a portable Mac computer.

The patent explains this is a “computer in an input device” that’s essentially a Mac mini if it was crammed into a Magic Keyboard housing. “A strong demand for portable computing devices which also deliver high performance has driven miniaturization and reduction in size of the once bulky computing components used to power and drive the devices” reads the patent.

The keyboard housing would contain all the components like “processors batteries memory integrated circuits” so that the user would only need to hook it up to a monitor. In addition to mentions using heat-conductive materials to dissipate heat generated by such a device the patent says that a portable computer in a keyboard could even be folded to make it even more compact. There may even be a Trackpad built-into the keyboard so that the user doesn’t even need to bring a pointing device.

The patent doesn’t really show one kind of device but rather many possible hardware configurations and methods for a portable keyboard/computer to make sense. This patent doesn’t confirm that Apple will ever make such a product but it’s fun to imagine what if.

Instead he finished 24th one lap down after watching a potential first win slip away.

Reddick had led 90 of the race’s opening 151 laps won the first two stages and was pulling away from the field when the left rear tire on the No. 8 Chevrolet went down. The Corning Calif. native proceeded to lose the lead and was limping his car around the track in the high lane when things got even worse.

William Byron who ran inside the top 10 the entirety of the race until that point and had even led 16 laps wiggled as he was passing Reddick. The bobble caused the No. 24 to go up the racetrack and right into the No. 8 machine before hitting the outside wall.

“So frustrated I made that mistake for our team today” Byron said. “What a fast car and we were making our way back to the front. I got loose getting under the No. 8 [Reddick] who had a flat. Thankful for such a fast car and I know we’ll be back stronger next week.”

The crash ended the day for Byron who has yet to finish a race this season. He was credited with 34th.

Reddick was able to drive away from the incident and the Richard Childress Racing crew got the car repaired enough to keep going. But his No. 8 no longer had competitive speed finishing the race as the first car one lap down in 24th.

“Absolutely gutted by how our race unfolded but I couldn’t be prouder of this whole team and what we were able to do a majority of this race today” Reddick said. “We will learn from this. We will become stronger from this and be hungrier than ever before. … We will keep this momentum going to Las Vegas next week.”

Despite the poor result Reddick tied for the sixth most points scored on the day thanks to two stage wins. The 90 laps Reddick led were more than his first two seasons running the NASCAR Cup Series combined.

But despite the RCR cars showing more speed so far in 2022 than in recent years Reddick is still looking for this first top-20 finish of the season."

COST,Costco,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vYmdyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9vbmUtb2YtY29zdGNvcy1iaWdnZXN0LXNlY3JldHMtd2FzLWp1c3QtcmV2ZWFsZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,One of Costco's biggest secrets was just revealed,"It’s only recently that I’ve discovered just how passionate Costco’s loyal fan base is for the membership-only retail chain. There are blogs and websites for example dedicated solely to the chain and the comings and goings within its product assortment. Social media accounts also promote changes in that product availability in addition to touting the myriad deals that shoppers quickly pounce on. And then there’s the Costco Kirkland Signature brand.

This in-house Costco product line is so huge that just a few years ago? The Wall Street Journal was reporting around 25 percent of Costco’s $118.7 billion in annual sales came from Kirkland Signature products. Basically the line offers generic versions of established products people can buy on the cheap. Moreover here’s the secret that casual Costco shoppers might not be aware of. Many Kirkland Signature products are actually generic versions made by the same companies behind the original.

Costco’s Kirkland Signature products

Here’s how the chain describes its exclusive private label house brand. “In 1995” a summary from the chain reads “Costco began the Kirkland Signature line after recognizing a need for better quality goods at a greater value. Our mission was simple: Create an item of the same — or better — quality than the leading brand at a lower price and do so by controlling every element of the item’s creation including packaging and transportation.

Tech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.

“The end result: Kirkland Signature products are incredible quality goods at simply excellent prices.”

Along these lines here’s an example of the secret we alluded to above. Costco CEO Craig Jelinek confirmed that Duracell actually makes the Kirkland Signature alkaline batteries available to Costco shoppers. Likewise Huggies maker Kimberly-Clark also makes Kirkland Signature-branded diapers while Kirkland Signature jelly beans are a product of — who else? — the popular Jelly Belly brand.

Other Costco products

On the beverage front big names like Starbucks and Ocean Spray are also involved with the Costco Kirkland Signature line. Say you pick up one of the many Kirkland Signature coffee bags available to buy for example. It will likely declare right there on the package that Starbucks is the source. Likewise Ocean Spray makes the Kirkland Signature cranberry juice available at Costco.

If other Kirkland Signature products also look familiar here’s why. Per The Journal before Costco goes down this road and develops a generic version of a product through its private label? The chain will often turn to a brand name first. They’re given an opportunity to produce the Kirkland Signature version presumably to keep their hand in the quality even of this ancillary product.

Some companies agree some decline. Something to consider next time you’re walking down the aisle and one of these items catches your eye.

And whenever Costco puts something new on the pallet members are quick to notice and spread the word especially when they discover a must-have. For those days when you need a helping hand in the kitchen or a no-fuss rainy-day dinner we found five of the products that you might want to pile high in the freezer based on shoppers' overwhelming enthusiasm for them on social media. (And for more here are 6 Things You'll See at Costco This Year.)

La Boulangerie San Francisco Spicy Chicken Sandwich on Brioche Bun

Everybody loves a good chicken sandwich. You might prefer it from your restaurant of choice but it can't hurt to have a few on hand in your own kitchen. There's been a lot of hype around this new item that showed up in the frozen section at the end of 2021 according to an Instagram post by @costcohotfinds. The package of six sandwiches features both the spicy breaded white meat chicken patties and the soft sturdy brioche buns to nestle them between.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

Reddit users recommend using the air frying instructions on the package as well as customizing the sandwich with additional toppings (lettuce onions tomato pickles mayo hot sauce – whatever floats your boat!)

Tru Fru Milk Chocolate Strawberries

These frozen strawberries coated in a crunchy milk and white chocolate exterior came back for an encore appearance at Costco just in time for Valentine's Day. One user on Reddit spotted the dessert at the end of January which drummed up excitement from people in the comments. Redditor u/iggypop19 said ""Really hope my store gets them back at some point in the future because I'll be stocking up on several bags to put away in case they disappear again.""

Tru Fru made its debut in May last year and it seems they've garnered fans who have been eagerly awaiting their return to the icebox. If you can manage to pick up one of the 20-ounce bags before they disappear the only regret you'll have from buying these in bulk is justifying how many you should eat in one sitting.

Motor City Pizza Co. Detroit-Style Deep Dish Pizza

Hailed by one Reddit user as the best frozen pizza they've tried the consensus on this two-pack of meat-laden Detroit-style deep dish pie is clear—it's a must-buy. It comes in both Double Pepperoni and Ultimate Meat and it's gained a large following.

Redditor u/onetimeuse789456 commented ""This pizza is legit. I've had separate conversations with multiple people who also think it is amazing. I do not know why this brand isn't in more stores. I'd 100% buy this over anything else. Getting this pizza is half the reason why I go to Costco.""

Followers of @thecostcopro showed equal excitement when the Instagrammer posted a video preparing the Ultimate Meat package with the caption: ""Now I see why everyone loves it so much. Happy National Pizza Day!""

If you're looking for a new go-to pizza to add to your freezer stash this is a steal your tastebuds will thank you for.

Milton's Craft Bakers Meat Lover's Trio Cauliflower Crust Pizza

For the pizza lover who's gluten-free this frozen pick should satisfy your craving for that meaty cheese combo—all on top of a thin crisp cauliflower crust. And from a nutritional perspective it's guilt-free to boot. This two-pizza package came out in March 2021 according to Instagram account @costcodeals but its presence has been spotty ever since.

At the end of January @costcohotfinds found it sitting in the freezer aisle once more. Some comments noted that their local store wasn't carrying it so it may only be back in several regions for now. However if you're not in the Bay Area Northeast or Midwest area @costcohotfinds said that the vegetarian variety Roasted Vegetable should be available nationwide.

Brown Sugar Boba Milk Tea Mochi

A twist on the Boba Milk Tea Mochi from July 2021 Costco brought back this top seller in a new flavor: Brown Sugar Boba Milk Mochi. The name is a mouthful which feels appropriate for these bite-sized frozen treats. Instagram account @costco_empties found it in February in the warehouse to the delight of commenters.

The original flavor sold out quickly according to comments on an Instagram post by @costcobuys which is all the more reason to snag one of these 60-piece packages before they do another disappearing act. But be forewarned—if you don't like the texture of boba you might want to opt for a different dessert from the Kirkland freezer section.

It seems some locations still might carry certain kinds but the original variety pack in that classic cardboard tray that we all remember from back in the day may be gone for good. The Costco Business Delivery website does show three flavors of the muffins in stock in individually-wrapped packaging but they don't appear to be available on the regular Costco website.

As any lover of baked goods would understand many are understandably upset about the development. Some muffin fans remember the original variety pack fondly like one Reddit user who posted a picture of the original packaging calling it ""retro style"" for fans in the thread to reminisce over. Likeminded fans of the Costco muffins sounded off in the comments section sharing their nostalgic experiences eating them. One commenter loved these muffins so much as a kid they said ""I'd sneak a second one for breakfast. And probably have another two muffins before bed."" Another person added ""As a teenager I would kill two of those as a snack and three as a meal."" One diehard fan even made a Change.org petition to bring back the discontinued lemon poppyseed muffins. (The current poppyseed option if you can even find it is an almond poppyseed variant instead of lemon flavor.) Here's to hoping the attention encourages Costco to bring them back!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9tb25leS9zaG9wcGluZy8yMDIyLzAyLzI2L2Nvc3Rjby10YXJnZXQtZmFjZWJvb2stZ3JvdXBzLWJsYWNrLXdvbWVuLzY3NDkyMTIwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Target Facebook shopping group one of several centered on Black women,"Danielle Broadway

Special to USA TODAY

While some retailers fail to support Black lives there is a growing trend of shopping groups on social media created for and by Black women propelling social change. For them shopping isn’t just about products. It’s about community building bonding over buying and sometimes encouraging multi-generational Black wealth.

Too often there aren’t spaces exclusively for the collective joy and protection of Black women especially on the internet group leaders say. When Black women aren't co-opted assimilated or silenced they add they thrive.

USA TODAY spoke with Black women online groups for Trader Joe’s Costco Target and Starbucks by Zoom and email. Here’s what they had to say.

TARGET BLACK-OWNED BRANDS:Target stands with Black-owned businesses in Black History Month and beyond

TARGET TEST:Target to test adding Starbucks drinks and store returns to Drive Up orders

Black girls in Trader Joe’s Instagram group

An Instagram group with 218000 members Black Girls In Trader Joe’s was formed by Cleveland Ohio resident Mercedes “Dee” Davis who also created Facebook hashtag #BlackGirlsInTraderJoes and a private FB group exclusively for Black women that now has over 44000 members.

“I’m a believer in creating community and safe spaces for Black women. That’s exactly what the FB group gives. It’s like a big fam!” Davis said via email.

While she adores Trader’s Joe’s Davis believes it should support Black women shoppers more.

“The big TJ (Trader Joe’s) pages are run by white women who already share and post to the current TJ demographic'' she says. ""Creating BGITJ (Black Girls In Trader Joe’s) I’ve changed the game because it’s a lot of BW (Black Women) who have never shopped at TJ before and are now faithful shelf-clearing shoppers.”

According to Davis Trader Joe’s has featured store displays inspired by popular product combinations that originated on BGITJ. “If they (TJ) do indeed value Black women shoppers'' she says ""it’s time to do so publicly.”

BGITJ fosters solidarity with matching T-shirts and the group’s tagline “We In This Thang!” And the group’s community isn’t limited to the computer as Davis hosts in-person events too. The first “BGITJ: Just Vibes Retreat” was held in September 2021 in her hometown of Cleveland Ohio.

“It was incredible’’ Davis said. “Forty Black women coming together. It was more than just a love for TJ.”

Black women who love Target Facebook group

This Facebook shopping community of over 20000 doesn’t just celebrate the retailer it uplifts the Black women who are the group's members.

After joining Black Women Who Love Trader Joe’s in February 2021 Fort Worth Texas educator Sharla Horton-Williams was inspired to ask members if they’d like a Black Women Who Love Target page too. The response was overwhelming.

Horton-Williams said she wanted to create an environment to help Black women feel safe.

“We talk a lot in Black Women Who Love Target about haircare and skincare’’ she said. “Those are unique to our culture. It’s a safe place and it's a fun place. We get to use our dialects without being judged. We get to talk about things that are important to us without having to explain and translate to the rest of the world.”

For Horton-Williams it’s also crucial that Target respects Black shoppers. “They’ve really been a frontrunner in establishing and honoring Black excellence and Black creativity'' she says ""So almost always we share the newest Black designers or feature the newest Black art that’s in Target.”

This Facebook group even sports custom shirts made by members Bijou Karman and Natalia Vaughns.

Black Women Who Love Targetmember Kinna Thomas is a testament to how online shopping affinity groups empower Black women to explore their interests and share them with others.

“I joined because sometimes I just need help on what to buy or try” Thomas said. “This particular group helps connect to others like me who loves to shop and try new things. The posts about everyday essential items like skincare and toiletries are my favorites. It’s also fun to see how people express their personal style since fashion is one of my natural interests.”

Target meets the group’s joint admiration with reciprocity as it wants to make Black shoppers and businesses feel seen.

Gloria Delgadillo part of Target’s communications team says that “at Target our goal is to create a shopping experience where all guests feel welcomed and represented and we’ve made commitments to ensure Black guests see themselves represented from the merchandise we offer to our marketing efforts and more.”

The company’s investment in both Black shoppers and employees allows for novel possibilities that haven’t historically been available Target says.

Black women who love fashion private Facebook group

Many members of these online groups are often inspired to create their own.In Thomas’s case that meant creating a community focused on fashion.

She created the private Facebook group Black Women who Love Fashion in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd. It was a time in which many Black people needed nurturing environments to feel collective joy and since then it continues to evolve.

“It’s extremely important to me to amplify the voices of Black women and create a safe space to connect” Thomas says. While her page does focus on “chatting over fashion” there’s what Thomas calls a “broader dialogue” at play.

She emphasizes that her group is about “the importance of feeling accepted and loved just as you are ... it’s a celebration of them and that feels incredibly important during these uncertain times.”

With over 70000 members her community has grown larger than Thomas ever imagined.

“It’s so meaningful for me to create a place of refuge rest and joy for Black women all over the world” she said.

Black women who love Costco Facebook community

A Facebook community that bonds over Costco merchandise as well as building multi-generational Black wealth Black Women Who Love Costco was founded by Dallas Texas resident Josef Spencer Hudson after she asked members of another group what new pages they’d like to see.

Eventually Hudson recruited her friend Rachael E. Brown from Wylie Texas as a group administrator to help with the community’s over 29000 members.

“It goes beyond being a place for us to as we say ‘Kiki’ (or socially gather )'' Hudson said. ""We introduced so many other topics and people have been educating each other in there not only on how to purchase Costco stock but how to purchase other stock and build wealth.”

Black girls love Starbucks Instagram group

This Instagram group of over 7000 enjoys coffee and conversation. Imani Isoke Johnson of Hempstead New York started IG page Black Girls Love Starbucks after being a fan of Starbucks and collecting its cups for years.

While she found other Black women who love the franchise the sense of community is what bonds the group’s members.

“This page has definitely helped me make new relationships with women who I have so much in common with” Johnson said adding that she is willing to hop on a phone call or reach out to any members are in need. She also has small in-person gatherings with group members — at a local Starbucks of course.

Drivers were spotted waiting in a long queue at Costco petrol station in Liverpool this afternoon February 26.

Meanwhile a Tesco petrol station in Prescot had run out of all unleaded petrol and diesel today with only super unleaded fuel available.

Signs were put up outside the petrol station warning drivers of the situation and on the petrol pumps.

Priced at 139.7 for unleaded petrol Costco appears to be the cheapest place in the city region to get petrol according to petrolprices.co.uk.

Average fuel prices at UK forecourts are already at record highs and the situation is expected to worsen as retailers pass on further rises in wholesale costs.

The price of fuel remains an ongoing issue but motorists could face more misery in the coming weeks and months.

Concerns have been raised previously that Russia's invasion of Ukraine will push petrol pump prices up to a staggering £1.50 ""very soon"".

RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ""The question then becomes where will this stop and how much can drivers take just as many are using their cars more and returning to workplaces.

""If the oil price was to increase to 110 US dollars there's a very real danger the average price of petrol would hit £1.55 a litre.

""This would cause untold financial difficulties for many people who depend on their cars for getting to work and running their lives as it would skyrocket the cost of a full tank to £85.""

Reports were seen across social media that motorists were queuing at forecourts in areas across Merseyside over the weekend with some even running out of petrol.

However whether this is connected is not confirmed.

Whilst huge queues were seen at Costco on Waterloo Street no queues were seen elsewhere on Saturday afternoon.

According to the petrol comparison website the top five cheapest places for unleaded are:

Costco priced at 139.7p

Asda Bootle Orrell Lane priced at 142.7p Sainsburys Rice Lane priced at 143.9p Tesco Allerton Road priced at 143.9p Tesco Litherland priced at 143.9p

1. Nunney to Frome (Nunney Castle)

This is not a route to be travelled alone at night time.

Rumour has it that during the 1970s a man dressed in a check jacket and flannel trousers repeatedly haunted people travelling along the road.

(Image: Paulgillisphoto.com)

This notorious local ‘ghost’ inhabits the road between Nunney and Critchill. In recent years dozens of drivers have reported seeing a man in a sports jacket looking for a lift.

To get news like this straight to your inbox click here.

Some have even stopped and the man has got into their car before mysteriously vanishing a fact which led to the stretch of road being named among Britain’s most haunted during a 2001 survey.

The Frome area is full of legends about ghosts ghouls and haunted houses. There have also been reports of a hooded monk walking near Norton St Philip and the ghost of a lady stalking the corridors of Longleat House.

2. Wookey Hole (Cheddar)

The Witch of Wookey Hole has cast her deathly spell over the soaring rock chambers where the hidden River Axe flows for centuries.

She is said to lurk in the shadows deep beneath the Mendip Hills.

(Image: SWNS)

You can even see the remains of the witch for a fee over £100. You can see features such as a pair of stalagmites that are allegedly the petrified remains of a witch and her dog.

Now a tourist attraction the owners regularly put on spooky events for ghost hunters to enjoy.

3. Shepton Mallet prison (Shepton Mallet)

With its high stone walls and foreboding atmosphere Shepton Mallet Prison is an eerie place at the best of times.

A former category C goal HMP Cornhill housed the infamous Kray Twins and was the site of several executions.

Decommissioned in 2013 the prison has been lined up for development with heritage tours allowed to take place until the builders move in.

While the prisoners may have long since departed its eerie history has come back to haunt one of the prison tour guides.

So spooky is this place that one of the tour guides believed he received a painful wound on one of his hands as a result.

Paul Toole a senior site manager at the prison told Somerset Live: “I looked down and it looked like a large red mark.

""I tried to continue with the tour. As I led people out of the gallows room and looked down I thought “blimey” that looks rather raw.""

Frome tunnels (Frome)

Located beneath the streets of the town these tunnels are still being unearthed and made accessible to the public.

People are allowed to venture down into the tunnels on very rare occasions. They’re certainly not for the faint of heart but more and more are continuously discovered.

Neighbours’ first hand accounts suggest they run for some 200 yards up into Vicarage Street one way and across towards Bath Hill the other.

Recent reports suggest there is a tunnel from an old property lower down Bath Street which runs from their cellar and under the hillside towards St John’s Church.

A resident recalled playing in it as a child and described it as tall enough for him to stand up in at the time. The tunnel apparently ran for some 50 yards.

The Tunnel Team are planning to seek permission to investigate.

Taunton Castle (Taunton)

The ghosts that haunt Taunton Castle reportedly stem from the Monmouth Rebellion and the Battle of Sedgemoor.

James Scott 1st Duke of Monmouth was the illegitimate son of King Charles XI and his mistress Lucy Walter.

Having captured the castle his army was eventually squashed by his uncle James XI and the Duke was beheaded with 200 of his followers sent to the gallows while others were sold into slavery.

These harrowing events still haunt the halls of the castle to this day.

The Choughs Hotel (Chard)

This hotel is situated in the centre of town on the high street but it was reportedly once a school and may even have been a brothel at one point.

Ghostly apparitions faint crying and the smell of burning are just some of the paranormal activity believed to have been witnessed in recent years.

(Image: Fran Stothard/Bristol United Press)

Staff members have seen a black cat in some of the rooms and one man says he saw a ghostly woman walk past the bathroom doorway while he was shaving.

Back in 2010 landlady Marie Baker and her husband Jason told the Western Gazette: “There are loads of example of strange goings-on here which many people claim to have seen or heard.

“In the long room upstairs which backs on to the Conservative Club you can sometimes smell burning. When the Chard fire hit in 1577 the Con Club burned down but the fire stopped just before the back wall of the long room.

“This building was a school at the time and the room was a dormitory people have also said they can hear a girl crying in there.”

The hotel is said to be one of the most haunted in Britain. It featured on an episode of Most Haunted during season 5.

Glastonbury Tor (Glastonbury)

Glastonbury is known as one of the county’s most mythical towns and has been a sacred site for thousands of years with connections to St Patrick and King Arthur.

Rumour has it during a meeting between a monk St Collen and Gwyn ap Nudd King of the Fairy Folk and Lord of Annwn the monk threw holy water at him banishing the King and his army.

(Image: Getty)

The King had used the Tor as a doorway to the dead. It is now thought that screams and howls can be heard on some nights.

The George and Pilgrim (Glastonbury)

The George and Pilgrim dates from at least 1475 as a pre-Reformation inn and it was used by people visiting Glastonbury Abbey and perhaps by monks.

Among the spirits said to haunt the pub is the ghost of a monk who was walled up in the tunnels beneath Glastonbury after he fell in love with a woman. The woman’s ghost is also said to roam the building.

Another reported ghost is that of Judge Jeffreys the “hanging judge” who was Lord Chancellor and Lord High Steward under the reign of King James II of England and handed down around 300 death sentences following the Monmouth Rebellion in Somerset in 1685.

Other sightings have included orbs cold patches ghostly footsteps the scent of cigar smoke the sound of harp music and TVs turning themselves on and off.

One of the ghosts has even reportedly been captured on camera.

Back in 2012 Nicola Davies and her partner Jason Smith from Caerphilly in Wales were staying at the hotel to mark a birthday and took a few photographs of themselves in the mirror.

They were shocked to find that one of the photographs showed an otherworldly visitor peeking at them from behind Mr Smith’s shoulder.

“I’d visited Glastonbury before and really liked it” said Nicola.

“So when my 44th birthday came around Jason took me to Glastonbury for the night to celebrate.”

Researching the pub online the couple had discovered it was reputed to be haunted.

“I was told that room number one was the most haunted so I said I was glad we were in room three” Nicola said.

“Then Jason pointed out that we were booked into room one.”

She said she found the atmosphere in the pub “spooky” but had been terrified after spotting the mysterious shape in the photograph.

“There was a woman in the bar who looked at it and she said she thought it was a small child but I think it looks more like a skull.”

Ms Davies was so shaken by the photograph that she says she required “a couple of drinks” to calm herself down enough to sleep in the room.

The Crown Hotel (Wells)

This hotel in Wells is so haunted that an ITV television series investigated its goings-on.

Visitors and staff report finding black barley seeds mysteriously arranged in a cone shape on pillows.

Duvet covers have been thrown off beds and an old woman has been seen going upstairs with a small bag but disappears when staff try to find her.

Called the Diamond Edition in honor of Shelby American's 60th anniversary it reproduces the design of Shelby's CSX Cobra replicas in beautiful carbon fiber. The body shell weighs just 88 pounds and is based on a later 1965 Cobra so it features flared fenders and a hood scoop in place of the cleaner look of earlier models.

That lightweight body is paired with an 800-hp version of Ford's 5.0-liter V-8 which achieves that prodigious output with help from a supercharger. The engine drives the rear wheels through a 6-speed manual transmission and breathes through a stainless-steel exhaust system with side pipes. Performance figures aren't available but Classic Recreations hinted on its website that it's expecting big things from a prototype currently under construction.

Classic Recreations Diamond Edition carbon fiber Shelby Cobra replica

The Cobra replica also features independent rear suspension while stopping power is provided by Wildwood brakes with 6-piston calipers in front and 4-piston calipers in the rear.

Each car will also get a diamond-encrusted badge with a reproduction of the late Carroll Shelby's signature on the dashboard. Don't expect many other creature comforts as Cobra interiors have always been about minimalism.

Just 10 Diamond Editions will be built at a cost of $1.2 million each.

Minister of Tourism and International Transport Senator Lisa Cummins yesterday said the latest protocol changes would bring a quick end to bottlenecks that had become the norm at two gates of the airport and there would now be a smoother transition from aircraft to the arrivals hall.

Cummins was speaking during a press conference yesterday at which it was revealed that arriving passengers would no longer have to present negative PCR test results at the airport which would now be accepting negative antigen tests for the COVID-19 virus.

She said there had been significant challenges with long lines and even longer waits at gates 14 and 16 where public health officials had set up a special facility to check PCR test results.

The minister noted that the decision to move to antigen testing would not only assist Barbadians returning home but also gave the country the advantage of being chosen as a destination by tourists who had been finding it difficult to secure PCR testing at home.

She said many Caribbean destinations had already made the move to antigen tests acceptance based on the available science.

“In the last two weeks we have been working on the congestion issues . . . . A number of visitors from our primary source markets had expressed challenges with being able to access the required (PCR) tests in particular coming out of the North American market. In addition a number of visitors arrived with the wrong test which led to retesting” she revealed.

Cummins said with the need to spend in some instances as much as US$250 per person in a family to get a PCR test now removed visitors could direct more spending to other things in Barbados.

“The move from gates 14 and 16 back to the arrivals hall is a significant change in the process. We are now from last night [Friday night] accepting passengers getting off their aircraft and heading to gates nine and 13 through the arrivals hall. For the majority of the passengers arriving . . . now there will no longer be a need for the buses to take them to the arrivals hall.”

Cummins said that in two weeks Barbados would be rolling out a new advanced ED immigration form.

Australia are touring Pakistan for the first time since 1998 with the two sides set to contest three Tests three ODIs and one T20I

Pat Cummins says he feels ""incredibly safe"" in Pakistan after arriving in the country for Australia’s multi-format tour.

Australia are playing in Pakistan for the first time since 1998 while the visit also marks their first overseas Test series since summer 2019.

New Zealand and England (men and women) were due to play Pakistan in Pakistan in 2021 before pulling out of their respective tours due to security concerns.

However Cummins has praised the safety standards put in place by the Pakistan Cricket Board upon his side’s arrival.

""I feel incredibly safe and we’ve been really well looked after by the Pakistan Cricket Board"" Cummins said. ""There’s been lots of security upon arrival. We were straight off the plane and straight into the hotel.

""We've got a pretty good set-up and we'll be confined to the hotel except for games and training. We've travelled to places like India where you don't leave the hotel too much so we are used to it. It's comforting and we're really lucky to be surrounded by so many professionals.

""One of the factors we wanted to be really thorough on before arriving here was not only security but also bio-security. Everyone has done a fantastic job so we can just concentrate on cricket and really enjoy our first tour here for 24 years.""

Discussing being part of the first Australian tour to Pakistan since 1998 he continued: ""We feel lucky to get to come back here after a whole generation didn't get the chance to play any cricket over here.

“I think it [Pakistan] has slowly had more cricket here. George Bailey our selector came and played a couple of games a few years ago.

""The Pakistan Super League has also been hugely successful. We're fortunate that they have come to play us in Australia and it's great we can return the favour.""

Cummins recently led Australia to a thumping 4-0 Ashes victory over England at home and his captaincy will now have a big test now in Pakistan conditions. Australia is set to play a three-match Test series three ODIs and one-off T20I against Pakistan.

This will be the first tour for Australia to Pakistan since 1998 as not many teams have been touring the nation after the 2009 terrorist attack on players in the Sri Lankan bus. Zimbabwe Sri Lanka West Indies Bangladesh and South Africa have been the recent teams to tour the nation however Australia’s entry into the nation might lead to New Zealand and England touring the country as they pulled out last year citing security reasons.

We’re lucky to be surrounded by professionals: Pat Cummins

Cummins noted that the security arrangements have been good right from landing at the airport until coming into the hotel. He added that the players have been comfortable around in the hotel and stated the bio bubble has restricted them to just the hotel and ground.

“I feel incredibly safe. We’ve been really well looked after by the PCB. Upon arrival there’s been lots of security. We were straight off the plane and straight to the hotel. We’ve got a pretty good set-up here and we’ll be confined to the hotel except for games and training. It’s comforting and we’re really lucky to be surrounded by so many professionals” Cummins was quoted as saying by India Today.

“There are lots of things around which might be a little bit different to what we’re used to but we know it’s been taken care of so we can just really enjoy ourselves here” he added.

After successfully passing the Ashes test Australia Test skipper Patrick Cummins moves away from his backyard as an overseas challenge in the form of Pakistan awaits him. With his team scheduled to play a three-match Test series against Pakistan Cummins currently is on the hunt for new techniques to bring the opposition down to the mat.





Cummins who will be leading Australia overseas for the first time in his captaincy career talked about being ‘creative’ and ‘brave’. ""It throws up a different challenge to the cricket we've grown up used to playing in Australia. There's probably going to be times where I'll have to be more creative try a few different things be brave so I'm excited for that challenge"" the fast-bowling all-rounder said as quoted by ESPNcricinfo.





""We don't really know what to expect over there. Subcontinent Tests can be played quickly or slowly but think for a lot of this group we haven't played a lot of cricket overseas so if we want to be No. 1 in the world we have to have a really good showing on these subcontinent tours"" he added.





After warming themselves up against a timid England side the mighty Aussies will look in to bring a new dimension of preparation for playing in the subcontinent. With reverse swing always a great asset in Pakistan the numero-uno Test bowler mentioned how the fast-bowlers are working hard to master the skill as recent pitches and matches in Australia have not allowed them to do so.





""It's made us not to expect to have a just a really spin-friendly subcontinent conditions that perhaps we've experienced in past Indian or Sri Lanka tours. Seems like the pace bowlers have done quite well and they've got a really strong pace-bowling line-up. We feel like the squad we have covered all areas and we are really comfortable if we need extra spinners or extra pace bowlers.





""A lot of time the ball reverse swings so we didn't really experience it this summer with grassy wickets short games whereas over there it can be a real weapon so trying to upskill that. We haven't bowled a lot of reverse swing in the last year or so but it's a huge factor going into the subcontinent"" Cummins asserted.





With Steven Smith serving as Cummins' deputy Australia's success in the series will also rely on the former considering his experience as a captain and batter in the subcontinent.





""There's lots of information that I'll be trying to sift through and get help from. Feel lucky to have someone like Smithy who has not only captained in India but also played quite a bit on the subcontinent"" he concluded.





Australia will depart this weekend for a full-fledged tour of Pakistan scheduled to begin from March 4 2022."

Why Your Local CVS Will Start Closing in the Middle of the Day,"The next time you want to quickly pop out to the pharmacy make sure to check your watch because a recently announced change by CVS could leave you staring at a ""CLOSED"" sign when you try to pick up your prescription.

The New Change

Starting today and affecting many local CVS pharmacies here in the Hudson Valley many residents were surprised to wake up to an email from the retailer notifying them of a new policy. ""FYI I just received an email announcing this"" said one local Facebook user with a flurry of comments from people both complimenting and complaining about the change. The message reads:

To make sure all of our pharmacists have time to take a lunch break your local CVS Pharmacy will be closed daily from 1:30 to 2:00 PM. By taking care of themselves our pharmacists will be able to provide you with even better support and service. During that time all activity at the pharmacy will be unavailable including pickup drop-off and the drive-thru. Of course we're always open at CVS.com and in the CVS Pharmacy app. Thank you for helping us take care of our pharmacists and thank you for choosing CVS!

The Reason

The closings appear to be for daily paid break for pharmacists. ""About time they got a lunch break"" said one local resident. ""They’re doing it in Kingston too….I can’t believe they’ve been going without a lunch break!"" said another. Others expressed frustration. ""Agree to a lunch break but the whole department [doesn't] need to close"" commented one user. That seems like a rational suggestion but according to CVS employees there's a very specific and important reason why the entire pharmacy needs to fully shut down.

jacoblund/canva jacoblund/canva loading...

Necessary Closures

Every pharmacy has at least one licensed pharmacist on duty. While other employees work under them and can interact with customers and help fill prescriptions the pharmacist must also be actively working according to several employees. Said one CVS worker:

Up until now the pharmacist on duty has [received] no break and they work 12-hour days. I think it's great and much needed.

Replied one unwavering commenter ""I would be happy to work that shift I hate taking breaks I'm just not smart enough to be a pharmacist"".

Small Price to Pay

The overwhelming consensus is positive from Hudson Valley residents with the vast majority applauding the step CVS has taken to better care for their employees. Just keep in mind: from 1:30pm-2:00pm you'll have to find a different errand to run.

The good news? One can only wonder — and in the meantime speculate! — what series creator James Gunn might do for an encore.

Purposely created to be “un-skippable” (meaning you’d never reach for the SKIP INTRO button) Peacemaker‘s Season 1 credits quickly amassed many a fan and critical rave. Barging into each episode with the first shouts of Wig Wam’s “Do Ya Wanna Taste It” the 90-second song-and-dance number — choreographed by Charissa-Lee Barton directed by Gunn and filmed over one day in a high school auditorium — starts off with John Cena’s chrome-domed antihero joined by Freddie Stroma’s Vigilante and and Danielle Brooks’ Adebayo stomping through spots of light. A few beats later Jennifer Holland’s Harcourt and and Chukwudi Iwuji’s Murn march in from the wings joined by Steve Agee’s Economos and then Elizabeth Ludlow’s Keeya.

More from TVLine

Midway through Peacemaker fires his gun at the screen and we cut to Robert Patrick’s stone-cold Auggie delivering a hip thrust toward the camera after which Annie Chang’s Detective Song Christopher Heyerdahl’s Captain Locke and Lochlyn Munro’s Detective Fitzgibbon get pulled into the dance party. Rizwan Manji’s Jamil the Janitor sweeps across the floor past Mel Tuck’s Old Man and as the sequence builds to a close Cena hoists Nhut Le’s Judomaster onto his shoulders while Eagly perfectly hits his mark and fans his wings wide.

It was in a word perfection. So why mess with a very good thing? Well the fact is that as much as one-third of that original ensemble likely won’t be back for Season 2 due to their characters being killed off in the final episodes.

Gunn himself confirmed a Season 2 change-up tweeting to an inquiring fan “I think I have to because most of these people are no longer alive.”

But just how much do the opening credits have to change to accommodate as many as five exits (plus any Season 2 cast additions)? Are some elements such as the Wig Wam song untouchable indelibly associated as it now is with the hit DC series? Should the distinctive choreo be carried over as well and simply be recreated by the rejiggered ensemble?

How about an ironically shameless approach in which the exact same footage is used but the faces of any new actors are sloppily pasted onto the bodies of any exited stars — almost in the style of a Jib-Jab video?

Or should Gunn start from scratch and endeavor to deliver something quite new but equally dynamic and un-skippable?

There was no Tom Hanks this time; he was the inductee when a sketch first introduced the concept in 1990 and he appeared this past December when Paul Rudd (just barely) joined the club. But on hand to welcome Mulaney were Rudd himself Steve Martin Candice Bergen Elliott Gould and Tina Fey.

More from TVLine

Mulaney gets the traditional razzing from the veterans. Bergen doesn’t know who Mulaney is; his reply: “Well Candice you wouldn’t know me but if you have a niece or a son who’s bad at sports they might.” Martin calls him Megan Mullally. Gould doesn’t even remember being on Mulaney’s sitcom.

If you’re wondering what it takes to be a 5-Timer… well it helps to be able to recover from a flop. Mulaney makes a joke about “Dan Aykroyd’s tequila” that doesn’t get a response but he wins them back simply with the way he says “Listen…”

Which is why it’s so weird when Conan O’Brien (the club’s doorman from Hanks’ 1990 induction) shows up because he’s the master of flop recovery. Not only does SNL‘s director blow O’Brien’s entrance O’Brien himself fumbles one of his own lines. But a quick miming of him being drunk brings everyone back on board.

Maybe it’s time to get Conan hosting the show. After all what’s he got going on besides a podcast?

“I feel it is my duty and obligation to keep you informed when it comes to your Sheriff’s Office. It is important to me to always be transparent and honest with you at all times sharing the good and the bad. The need for and the importance of integrity is paramount with that in mind I write to you with a heavy heart.

I was shocked to my core as I received a call from the Division of Drug and Crime Control Missouri State Highway Patrol’s investigative unit at approximately 8:40 AM Friday February 25th 2022 informing me that my jail administrator Nick Murphy 42 of rural Warsaw was picked up at his residence and transported to a neighboring county where he was placed on a 24-hour investigative hold pending formal charges.

At approximately 5:30 PM the same day a special prosecutor from Platte County brought charges against Murphy for statutory rape or attempted statutory rape-1st degree with a person less than 14 years of age and two counts of statutory sodomy or attempted statutory sodomy-deviate sex with a person less than 14 years of age. These charges carry the “unclassified” classification meaning that it is up to the judicial process to determine the punishment rather than a predetermined classification such as an A B or C class felony if Murphy should be found guilty. Murphy is being held in the Pettis County Jail with no bond at this time.

My office and the office of prosecutor of Benton County will have no involvement in this case to ensure a fair and unbiased process as Murphy’s case moves forward. Murphy has been placed on administrative unpaid leave until further notice. I want to remind you that all individuals charged by law enforcement are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Any questions or concerns should be directed to the Public Information’s Officer with Troop A Headquarters in Lee’s Summit 816-622-0800.”

Webster City and Hamilton County officials along with members of the Webster City Area Chamber of Commerce gathered at the construction site just south of Webster City on Iowa Highway 17 just across the road from Tony’s Tires for a groundbreaking ceremony in April 2021.

“We’re very excited to come to Webster City. We hate to leave Woolstock — what a great little community and we had great neighbors there” said Tony Nielsen. “But we kind of outgrew the facility and needed to be in a little bit higher traffic area. John Deere kind of nudged us this way.”

Tony Nielsen along with Ken Nielsen Tyler Nielsen and Dennis Simmons the store manager were on hand to turn the first shovelful of soil at the building site. Tony Nielsen said he thought the location would be convenient for area farmers.

“We were looking for a spot and it took us a little while but I think we found a great location” he said. “We’re right on Highway 17 and just off of Highway 20. Obviously with the hospital courthouse USDA building going up and other new neighbors we think we’re in a good spot. There’s a lot of farm-related things nearby and we can add to that” he said.

Sande Construction and Supply Co. Inc. of Humboldt is the general contractor for the building project but Tony Nielsen said they will also be calling on Peterson Construction of Webster City for some of the subcontracting work.

“We’re excited to work with them and have them be part of our project” he said.

The new building will be a 54000-square-foot structure and is nearing completion now. Tony Nielsen said he anticipates that all of the employees at the Woolstock location will move to the new location.

“We’ve got several who live here locally and this will be good for them” he said.

Nielsen told the crowd that his family had traveled to Webster City many times for sports events.

“We played in Jefferson Gym and I think he did too” Tony Nielsen said pointing to Tyler Nielsen. “And he’s got two more brothers and the youngest one got to play in your new gym. That’s a fancy great facility.”

“Over the years Webster City has been very competitive and there’s a lot of pride in the community. We hope we can add a little bit to that” he said.

Dan Campidilli chairman of the Hamilton County Board of Supervisors said he welcomed the new business.

“We are just excited to have this new business locate here” he said. “I do travel to Woolstock to get parts so this will be much more convenient.”

Supervisor Rick Young who worked 25 years for the Nielsen family said the company will be a great fit in Webster City.

“They are very family oriented. We’ve got granddad son and grandson here working and there are other family members involved in the operation” Young said. “They are great people and will be a great addition to the community.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFncmljdWx0dXJlLmNvbS9tYWNoaW5lcnkvcGxhbnRpbmcvaW52ZW50aW5nLWEtbmV3LWNsb3Npbmctd2hlZWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inventing a new closing wheel - Planting,"If you search the internet for ""planter closing wheels"" you'll find every shape and size of aftermarket options ranging from solid wheels made of cast iron to wheels with fingers or tines to serrated disks.

However when Tony Wendler started looking for an option to replace the rubber closing wheels on his John Deere planter he felt a little like Goldilocks trying to find a comfortable bed.

""The hard rubber wheels can pick up mud if our soils are too wet and they can pack the sidewall when it really needs to be loosened up for better seed-to-soil contact"" says Wendler who farms near Armstrong Iowa.

""Yet many of the spiked wheels that I found had the potential to either overpenetrate or they would get too aggressive and throw seeds out of the furrow especially if you went too fast. Another problem was that the void between the spikes on some models could pick up and hold a rock. Others were made of poly which wears out rather quickly.""

So with the help of his son James who owns a fabricating company in Des Moines Iowa Wendler set out about seven years ago to design his own closing wheel. After testing a few variations and working with the agronomists at Beck's Hybrids he finally settled on a design that combines spikes with a depth ring.

Unlike other closing wheels Wendler's design which he calls the Germinator consists of two layers of steel stacked.

Each layer is made up of three pieces to reduce waste. (Each piece is also laser-cut from grade 50 steel.) To reduce wear the extra weight of the steel helps reduce down pressure needs in heavy soil and no-till conditions.

""I hold the provisional patent on the design and James and I hold the provisional patent on the manufacturing process"" Wendler says pointing out how the wheel components fit together like jigsaw puzzle pieces to form a perfect circle.

In contrast to some other designs the curvature between the teeth widens out so it sheds wet soil and any rocks it encounters. In the meantime the inner wheel which is welded into place against the spiked wheel acts as a depth gauge while firming the soil around the seed.

""We've tested it at speeds up to 12 mph and haven't found any place that the seed was thrown out of the row. In every case the seeds have been lined up in the bottom of the furrow.""

Builds Them Himself

Rather than sell his design Wendler has begun manufacturing and selling the Germinator under his own company Farm Shop Mfg. LLC (farmshopmfg.com).

Customers can buy the closing wheel to replace current rubber wheels using the existing wheel assembly and bearing. Or they can purchase the entire wheel assembly which includes new plastic closing wheel rims bearings and bolts. Pending no increase in steel prices the cost of the closing wheel alone is $65.

Wheel assemblies list for $25 each or $90 when purchased as a complete closing wheel unit that includes the spiked closing wheel.

In the meantime Wendler has been working with stores and dealerships to expand the market beyond his own mail-order business.

""We stock wheels for every brand except the Case IH planters that use a single closing wheel. On most planters the ring-only insert option simply installs on the factory wheels.""

Wendler's creative mind hasn't been content to just settle on a new closing wheel design though. He also has developed a new grain-temperature sensing system that links to a weather monitor which will allow producers to remove moisture from corn or add moisture to soybeans for higher market value."

Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines has joined the growing list of Western businesses suspending ties with Russia following that country’s invasion of Ukraine this week.

Delta has had a standing agreement with Russian-carrier Aeroflot allowing customers to book trips with both airlines on the same ticket and to allow customers to fly on each other’s flights.

Delta issued a statement on Friday that reads:

""We have removed our code from Aeroflot-operated services beyond Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport and removed Aeroflot’s code from Delta-operated services from Los Angeles and New York-JFK. Accommodations will be made for customers affected by these changes.""

Delta said the changes went into effect immediately following the announcement.

The airline noted that it does not operate services to Ukraine or Russia.

The announcement comes after Europe’s largest ground conflict since World War II something the West had been anticipating for week. It could also portend the emergence of a new ""Iron Curtain"" between the West and Russia with global repercussions.

U.S. President Joe Biden and his NATO partners agreed Friday to send thousands of troops to help protect allies along Europe’s eastern edge.

The United States European Union and other allies have begun to impose sanction against Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

It is not just businesses that are cutting tied. Russia has been stripped of hosting the Champions League final by UEFA with St. Petersburg replaced by Paris and Formula One dropped this season’s Russian Grand Prix at Sochi.

The organizers of the popular Eurovision Song Contest also said Friday that Russia will not be allowed to compete.

ATLANTA — Delta Air Lines has suspended its codesharing partnership with Russian national airline Aeroflot following Russia's invasion of Ukraine – and some Baltic and European nations announced the closure of their airspace to Russian carriers.

Atlanta-based Delta on Friday said its decision put a hold on the codesharing system allowing Delta and Aeroflot customers to book flights on both airlines.

""We have removed our code from Aeroflot-operated services beyond Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport and removed Aeroflot's code from Delta-operated services from Los Angeles and New York-JFK.

The optics were bad in the hyperracialized world in which we live but can we acknowledge the black passenger’s pain without condemning Delta Air Lines…at least until we have more info?

Black Woman Cries Foul Against Delta Air Lines Arguing Complaining White Women Were Privileged Over Her

Here’s a rundown of what occurred on a recent Delta flight from Atlanta to San Francisco according to Camille Henderson:

Henderson 25 was seated in 15A and two white women in their 50s were seated in 15B and 15C

There were two open seats in first class and the white women claimed they had upgraded over the phone and should be re-seated in the premium cabin seats

But flight attendants did not see the upgrade in their system and the passengers were unable to produce refreshed boarding passes so the women were forced to remain economy class

The white women bitterly complained to multiple flight attendants about their seating

This complaining continued with the woman continuing to gripe about the lack of legroom even after the flight departed

Later in the flight a flight attendant asked Henderson if she would mind moving back to row 34

She agreed to move gathered her belongings and made her way back to an aisle seat in row 34

Flight attendants offered her a complimentary cocktail for her inconvenience

Henderson complained to Delta Customer Service after her flight but her complaint was dismissed because she was moved “from a main cabin seat to another main cabin seat”

Henderson claims she agreed to move because “I don’t want to be the angry black woman that doesn’t listen to the rules even though the rules were that I paid for a seat and I went to my seat and I didn’t ask to move.”

That’s not quite right – as I’ve found in my own travels seat assignments are never guaranteed. There is no such thing as “my” seat though in this case the seat change was only requested not required. That said Henderson was wise to move rather than risk the ire of the flight attendants (and that’s a sad reflection on flight attendants in general).

Henderson told The Daily Beast that Delta’s conduct toward her constituted a microaggresion:

“We cannot have conversations about white people’s conveniences at the expense of black people being inconvenienced. [People focus on] the big events: the George Floyds all of the people that are unjustly killed by police redlinings food deserts all these things that happen on a larger scale. But we’re not necessarily talking about the microaggressions—actions that happen every single day to black people.”

A microaggresion is “a statement action or incident regarded as an instance of indirect subtle or unintentional discrimination against members of a marginalized group such as a racial or ethnic minority.”

I find myself of two minds here…which of course will lead to charges of my wokeism from some and racism from others. I invite you to help me think this through.

One extreme will dismiss Henderson’s claim wholly or even brand her a racist for “seeing everything” through a racial lens thus fomenting needless division. The other extreme will argue this incident is a clear demonstration of microaggresion white privilege and even racism.

But can’t we acknowledge Henderson’s pain without immediately condemning Delta or branding the flight attendants who moved Henderson as racists?

Henderson claims the act of moving her back several rolls constituted a microagression but couldn’t it also be that the flight attendants just wanted to shut up the two women from their complaining and it had nothing to do with Henderson? Henderson herself said the women would not let the issue go and kept complaining. While capitulation may not have been the best response I can hardly blame the flight attendants for trying to silence the complainers.

It appears there were not two seats together in the back which answers the question why the women were not moved. Some have suggested Henderson should have been upgraded to first class so the women could spread out in their economy class row but can you imagine the uproar that would have caused? (though admittedly I would have loved to watch that unfold…).

Flight attendants saw the quickest path to restoring peace onboard was to move Henderson to a different seat which happened to be behind her. Indeed it created bad optics (moving a black woman to the back of the bus while essentially rewarding the white women for being jerks) but unintentional racism? While I understand the idea of casual racism I don’t think we can go that far without more details…

At the same time I empathize with Henderson’s plight:

“When I moved to the back the whole plane is looking at me. It’s not like we were boarding. It’s not like they moved me before the plane took off…I have to carry all of my stuff with me to the back. As I’m moving to the back of the plane everybody is kind of looking. It’s just kind of embarrassing. I just felt like I was put under the spotlight and I really should not have. There was no need for me to move.”

I would have felt the same way…and I’m a white man not a black woman. Embarrassment is not limited to one race or gender. She should not have been asked to move.

CONCLUSION

I don’t stake a middle road position on this issue for the sake of being moderate. I’m open for greater understanding of why this was an egregious incident (or why it was not). But even without hearing Delta’s side of the story Henderson has failed to convince me that she was targeted on the basis of her race. That does not take away the embarrassment of being forced to move to the back of the plane during the flight or the bad optics of the rewarding the louts at the expense of someone who was just quietly minding her own business.

A Black woman says she was made to move to the back of a plane during a Delta flight per ABC7.

Camille Henderson claims that she was asked to move to give two white passengers more room reports say.

She told The Daily Beast she felt ""dehumanized"" by the experience.

A Black woman has accused Delta Airlines of booting her to the back of a plane mid-flight to make room for two white passengers ABC7 Bay Area was first to report.

Camille Henderson of Alameda California was flying to San Francisco from Atlanta Georgia in early February when the incident reportedly took place.

She was sitting in 15A —a window seat — before being told to move to row 34 about an hour into the flight according to ABC7.

Henderson claims she was told to move after two women who were both white complained to flight attendants about their seating arrangements. They were seated in 15B and 15C — the middle and aisle seats of the row Henderson was sitting in.

The Daily Beast reported that the women claimed they were supposed to have first-class seats but didn't have physical tickets to prove this. Delta staff said they couldn't seat them in first-class if they didn't have physical tickets according to a recording reviewed by the media outlet.

Henderson tried to sleep during the disagreement between the women and cabin crew she told The Daily Beast but a flight attendant woke her to ask her if she was traveling alone.

The flight attendant allegedly told her that if she moved it would give the two women more room Henderson claims per The Daily Beast.

""Me as a Black woman I was displaced to make two white women comfortable. That doesn't make any sense to me"" Henderson told ABC7.

She said she only agreed to change seats so as not to make a scene.""I don't want to be the angry Black woman that doesn't listen to the rules even though the rules were that I paid for a seat and I went to my seat and I didn't ask to move"" Henderson told The Daily Beast.

She told the media outlet she was offered a complimentary cocktail but she doesn't drink alcohol.

Henderson said she wants Delta Airlines to acknowledge the situation. ""I'm not looking for anything from Delta I'm not looking to be compensated"" she said per the media outlet. ""It's just a simple acknowledgment of a situation that they put me through that made me feel dehumanized.""

Delta Airlines did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

Omnia Midstream Partners LLC recently announced a development agreement to integrate renewable energy into the operations of Devon’s state line field in the Delaware Basin in west Texas and southeast New Mexico.

The project will include significant benefits for the producer’s stakeholders through carbon emissions reduction competitively priced electricity economic value in the investment and improved well run-time from a self-generated emission-free source of electricity that will enhance the stability of its private electric grid.

Omnia Midstream worked with Devon to integrate emissions-reducing renewable energy and battery storage into its power supply to supplement a highly dynamic upstream and midstream power demand. Omnia specializes in creating sustainable environmental solutions for upstream and midstream energy operations.

The project integrates photovoltaic and battery technologies into the company’s upstream oil and gas operations to reduce emissions and improve efficiency across the business. Design of the project incorporates U.S.-made solar panels inverters and battery storage to support dynamic power demand on the company’s private electric grid.

In addition the design incorporates data generated from Devon’s existing platforms then uses predictive analytics and insights to ensure that the renewable energy is being used efficiently.

Projects such as this one help the industry move toward achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions for direct and indirect sources by 2050.

“Renewables can drive responsible growth in the traditional energy sector” Chad Cagle Omnia’s co-founder said in a statement. “Our approach combines experience data analytics and renewable technologies to deliver sustainable energy transformations for oil and gas companies.”

Cagle said an importance part of the process has been Devon’s preference toward employing technology driven solutions for complex problems that require innovative solutions. Because of that approach Omnia has been able to develop other applications for solar energy in the upstream space.

Cagle also noted the tremendous backlogs of large-scale renewable projects seeking interconnection agreements with various utilities.

“By focusing on our client’s specific smaller-scale operational needs downstream of the utility meter we can quickly implement a solar and battery solution to improve reliability runtime reduce operating costs and most importantly reduce carbon footprint without the lengthy approval process necessary for larger scale projects” he said.

This report focused on revenue estimates and it looks as though the consensus view of the business has become substantially more conservative.

After the downgrade the consensus from Devon Energy's 22 analysts is for revenues of US$12b in 2022 which would reflect a discernible 6.3% decline in sales compared to the last year of performance. Per-share earnings are expected to jump 40% to US$5.86. Before this latest update the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$14b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.82 in 2022. Indeed we can see that the consensus opinion has undergone some fundamental changes following the recent consensus updates with a substantial drop in revenues and some minor tweaks to earnings numbers.

Check out our latest analysis for Devon Energy

The average price target was steady at US$58.10 even though revenue estimates declined; likely suggesting the analysts place a higher value on earnings. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. Currently the most bullish analyst values Devon Energy at US$70.00 per share while the most bearish prices it at US$45.00. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Devon Energy shareholders.

Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. Over the past five years revenues have declined around 1.6% annually. Worse forecasts are essentially predicting the decline to accelerate with the estimate for an annualised 6.3% decline in revenue until the end of 2022. Compare this against analyst estimates for companies in the broader industry which suggest that revenues (in aggregate) are expected to grow 3.5% annually. So while a broad number of companies are forecast to grow unfortunately Devon Energy is expected to see its sales affected worse than other companies in the industry.

The Bottom Line

The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment with analysts reconfirming that earnings per share are expected to continue performing in line with their prior expectations. Unfortunately analysts also downgraded their revenue estimates and industry data suggests that Devon Energy's revenues are expected to grow slower than the wider market. Overall given the drastic downgrade to this year's forecasts we'd be feeling a little more wary of Devon Energy going forwards.

Worse Devon Energy is labouring under a substantial debt burden which - if today's forecasts prove accurate - the forecast downgrade could potentially exacerbate.

Todd Grantham who was fired as Florida's defensive coordinator during the 2021 season has accepted an offer to join the staff according to a report from On3 Sports. Football Scoop was first to report the interest earlier this week.

He's the latest name with SEC connections after Alabama has added former Tennessee coach Derek Dooley and former LSU quarterback Zach Mettenberger as analysts in the offseason.

Grantham played for Frank Beamer at Virginia Tech in the 1980s. He started his coaching career there too before working as an assistant for Michigan State. Then he went to the NFL working for the Indianapolis Colts Houston Texans Cleveland Browns (defensive coordinator) and Dallas Cowboys.

Next Grantham returned to college football working as an assistant for Georgia before stops at Louisville Mississippi State and Florida. He served as defensive coordinator at all of those past three college stops.

He worked with recently fired Florida coach Dan Mullen at both Mississippi State and Florida before Mullen fired him in November.

The firing happened on Nov. 7 2021 after the Gators fell to 4-5 following a loss to South Carolina and Grantham's former coach's son Shane Beamer.

According to a new report published earlier in the week global agriculture is poised to benefit from the deployment of AI in agriculture.

AI for crop management

For instance AI in agriculture can improve crop management and agricultural productivity through rapid diagnosis of plant disease and efficient application of agrochemicals among others.

In the report titled “Responsible artificial intelligence in agriculture requires a systemic understanding of risks and externalities” researchers called out the need to review risks around unintended social-ecological consequences of machine learning models and potential safety and security concerns.

According to the researchers concerns around the relatively new field of AI are typically focused on bias inequality and privacy. When it comes to global agriculture however a different set of considerations emerge.

One revolves around the risks associated with deployment at scale say the researchers. They argue that as AI becomes indispensable in agriculture and culminates in an increasing reliance on common ML platforms such as TensorFlow and PyTorch this creates a potential point of failure that an attacker can exploit.

“[Farmers] will bring substantial croplands pastures and hayfields under the influence of a few common ML platforms consequently creating centralized points of failure where deliberate attacks could cause disproportionate harm.”

In addition non-malicious mistakes might also be vastly amplified taking place at machine speed faster than humans can respond – with disastrous consequences.

“If monocultures—where a single genotype of a plant species is cultivated on extensive lands—are irrigated fertilized and inspected by the same suites of algorithms a model error or poorly calibrated sensors may lead to excessive fertilization and soil microbiome degradation at the risk of large-scale crop yield failures.”

The researchers conceded that the widespread deployment of AI in agriculture is both valuable and expected. To avoid the pitfalls though necessitates careful navigation of the road ahead by implementing comprehensive risk assessments and anticipatory governance protocols.

Finally they concluded with a warning that the risk landscape discussed in their paper is similarly applicable to agricultural systems that provide non-food products such as the production of fiber fuels pulp oils rubber and plastic.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vbWFya2V0cy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL25ld3MvY3VycmVuY2llcy9jcnlwdG8tZW50cmVwcmVuZXVyLW5mdC1pbnZlc3RpbmctcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUtcGxheS10by1lYXJuLWdhbWUtMjAyMi0y0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,20-Year-Old Crypto Entrepreneur to Launch Play-to-Earn NFT Game,"Evandro Rodrigues created his first video game at 14 and pushed into the crypto world amid the pandemic.

Now 20 years old he's set to launch a new play-to-earn universe called House Game on Sunday.

He hopes one day it will rival NFT behemoths like Axie Infinity and Decentraland.

Twenty-year-old Evandro Rodrigues attributes his deep-dive into NFTs to three things.

The Bored Ape Yacht Club — a series of ""blue chip"" digital collectibles he hopes to one day own one of. Beloved crypto influencer Gary Vee. And his friends who hyped up blockchain technology.

Those catalysts he told Insider caused him to go ""all in"" on on NFTs — which are digital collectibles minted on the blockchain — and invent House Game. In his play-to-earn universe players can buy virtual houses and buildings with each represented as unique NFTs that yield tokens and can be sold on the secondary market.

But Rodrigues isn't new to gaming. The Boston entrepreneur created his first video game when he was 14 years old. Once the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020 he started investing in little-known cryptocurrencies with money he made from his job at Target as well as income from a successful web project and allowance from his parents.

The windfall from his crypto investments is powering his new venture creating the House Game which he hopes will one day rival behemoths like Axie Infinity and Decentraland.

Rodrigues said he wanted to create an NFT collection that would be more useful than just becoming a Twitter profile picture. And he wanted the tokens in his game to outlast the initial hype and maintain their utility for the long-haul.

Once it launches on Sunday House Game will have 7000 unique digital houses and 700 unique digital utility buildings that users can mint on the blockchain. According to the whitepaper each piece of digital real estate will yield $CASH which is the utility token players get by staking buildings and can burn to earn ethereum on a weekly basis.

Upon launch the game will have about 3000 VIP players. On Discord though the game already has 14000 members. The ""strong community"" according to Rodrigues who is a Christian is thanks in part to his hard work and faith. The server even includes a daily Bible verse channel.

After launching Rodrigues said he and his team will continue working to add utility to allow players to do more with their NFTs and $CASH.

The game is just the first piece in Rodrigues' push into the world of NFTs a market that swelled to $41 billion in 2021. He said the market for digital collectibles has many gaps and as a serial entrepreneur and long-time developer he said he plans on ""filling a lot of these gaps."" NFTs he said are at the mere dawn of their capabilities.

""I really do believe and we're not too far from it but down the line NFTs replacing documents replacing titles replacing all these things"" he said. ""The technology is really new and right now it's mainly being used for art but this is just the beginning. There's so much more utilization with NFTs with blockchain.""",,,,,,,,,

DG,Dollar General,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdGl6ZW4tdGltZXMuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvMjAyMi8wMi8yNi9zd2FubmFub2EtcmVzaWRlbnRzLWNvbmNlcm5lZC1mb3VydGgtZG9sbGFyLWdlbmVyYWwvNjk0MDc4MzAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Swannanoa residents concerned about fourth Dollar General in the area,"Three dollar stores exist within 5 miles of Rowland Road and U.S. 70. Dollar General plans to build a fourth in the same area.

An online petition to stop the Dollar General being built created by locals reached more than 1100 signatures with the goal of 1500. Jenny Wilds was one of those who signed.

Wilds whose property sits on the corner of Rowland Road and U.S. 70 said while she's not necessarily concerned about having a Dollar General across from her home she has concerns about how traffic will be impacted with her home being so close to the only entrance point.

Lights will shine through her window and trucks will likely have to swing into her yard to make the corner Wilds said.

""The orientation of the driveway is my main concern at this point"" Wilds said. ""There have been multiple accidents on that corner already.""

With ArtSpace Charter School located beside the store site Wilds said there's multiple times a day when traffic is blocked. She said the addition of a store would only make traffic worse.

The primary concerns for ArtSpace staff relate to the safety of the students. Located on U.S. 70 executive director Sarena Fuller said she recognizes the impact the school already has on the residential community and that the school has already invested in traffic handling to minimize impact.

In addition to the heavy traffic in the area Fuller said although there has been recent residential development there has been little to no pedestrian accommodation.

""The only sidewalks that exist are on our school property"" Fuller said. ""I'm worried about pedestrian traffic through our campus.""

Fuller cited recent rumors of violence at Dollar Generals throughout the county worrying about the proximity to ArtSpace. She said she spoke with the contractors about safety measures but there's no denying that no matter the business on the site traffic would increase in the area.

The site a former wooded lot was once a bike park for residents used also by students after school according to Fuller. She said it was sad to see the area leveled for a commercial business.

""We have expressed our concerns to county commissioners"" Fuller said. ""We have looked at that property before hoping that if it went up for sale that we might be able to purchase it.""

Unfortunately for ArtSpace the lot wasn't on the market long enough for the school to purchase it.

The new Swannanoa Dollar General falls under commercial county zoning laws meaning it does not require public input to be built. The only possible alternative would have been to apply for an appeal with the Board of Adjustment but at this late stage the time for an appeal has passed.

According to county planning directory Nathan Pennington the permit for the site was issued on Dec. 28. An appeal would have had to have been submitted within 30 days of the issued permit along with $500 paid to the county with the submitted appeal.

Pennington stressed the seriousness of an administrative appeal saying residents would need to seek legal counsel and be in contact with the county's legal department.

""They would have to demonstrate that staff erred in the issuance of whatever permit they're appealing"" Pennington said. ""You'd have to demonstrate what part of the code you think was misapplied.""

Although she consulted legal counsel Wilds said she was advised against pursuing legal action. Fuller took a similar approach in contacting the county commissioners but found the developers are in accordance with every zoning law.

The store development comes two years into an expansion on the ArtSpace campus. Fuller said the school worked with NCDOT and various traffic analysts to ensure the relationship with the surrounding area was manageable.

ArtSpace has a student population of roughly 400. The petition cites potential risk to the campus as well as the residential community due to the likely increase of traffic.

Residents continue to gather signatures for the petition addressed to Pennington though whether or not the county will take action remains to be seen.

""I can't do anything with a petition"" Pennington said.

The building of a new Dollar General is not uncommon in North Carolina. Across the state on average in 2020 a new location opened every eight days.

In New Bern at the opposite end of the state six stores line a single street with two directly across from one another. On Patton Avenue in Asheville a Dollar Tree and Family Dollar sit directly adjacent to each other.

Currently North Carolina has 930 Dollar General stores more than all but three states in the country.

Insider/Brittany Chang

FDA inspectors found a rat infestation at one of Family Dollar's distribution centers.

This led to Family Dollar closing more than 400 stores.

A retail consultant told Insider that inventory pile-ups and staffing shortages could be to blame.

Family Dollar closed 404 stores this week after a US government agency investigation found 1000 rodents at one of its distribution centers in Arkansas. The company on Friday announced that it was gradually reopening some of the stores.

According to the US Food and Drug Administration inspectors reported finding live rodents dead rodents in various states of decay rodent feces and dead birds in the building. Recalls were issued on certain items sold at its stores that were serviced by this distribution center; days later these stores closed altogether.

News of these infestations didn't come as a surprise to everyone however. Scott Mushkin CEO of consultancy firm R5 Capital told Insider that his team's recent visits to more than 50 of Family Dollar's parent company's stores Dollar Tree highlighted issues with chaotic backrooms and inventory pileups that could lead to rodent infestations.

""To call it chaotic is an understatement there were inventory mountains"" he said on a recent call. ""I've never seen anything like what we witnessed in those back rooms … there was plenty of cover for rodents to move around.""

Mushkin's team created a report after visiting 50 Dollar Tree stores which was shared with investment analysts and reviewed by Insider. The report shows stacks of boxes piled high in stock rooms at various Dollar Tree stores across the US.

Dollar Tree did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

""Store after store there were piles of inventory. In our opinion there is a very low probability that the company fully understands its inventory position at the stores"" the report said.

This paints a similar picture to what Insider found during store visits to two of Dollar Tree's Brooklyn locations in 2022 and 2018 where boxes were stacked up in the middle of the store or left to be unloaded on abandoned crates.

Mushkin said the inventory pile-ups he witnessed could be down to supply chain challenges and stock arriving all at once or staffing issues because of the labor crunch.

Gabriella Santaniello analyst and founder of retail research firm A-Line Partners echoed these sentiments.

""The stores are understaffed sometimes with only two people working so it isn't unrealistic that things like a rat infestation might go unchecked for a long time. They just don't have the bandwidth to deal with it. It's a sad reality"" she said.

It's not only the Dollar Tree group that has issues with unsafe box stacking in its stores (and a lack of staff to deal with it). Its main competitor Dollar General has faced over $3.6 million in proposed penalties from the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration since 2016 over issues of worker safety in its stores.







OSHA said in a press release this week that inspectors found examples of ""willful violations"" of employee safety at some of its stores last summer including stacking boxes in ""an unsafe manner"" and blocking exit routes.

While untidy stores haven't discouraged shoppers so far – dollar stores continue to grow at a rapid rate in the US and thrived during the pandemic – analysts say that recent reports of pest control issues are likely to be more damaging.

""The low price proposition of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar does result in trade-offs. No one expects the stores to be luxuriously appointed to have fantastic merchandising or to offer top-notch service"" Neil Saunders managing director of GlobalData Retail said in a note to Insider.

He continued: However basic hygiene including pest control is an expectation. I think most shoppers will find the latest headlines distasteful no matter how low the prices or how low the discounts are.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtZ3JvY2VyeS1zdG9yZXMtdXBncmFkaW5nLWxvb2tzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Grocery Stores Upgrading Their Looks This Year — Eat This Not That,"Nowadays both large and small-scale grocery stores have made significant changes in multiple ways but it's not always easy keeping up with the latest revisions.

Several modifications are underway at many popular retailers. From new store locations to increase sustainability efforts these store enhancements could possibly be coming to a store near you.

Over the past two years due to the pandemic much of the population has been spending a lot more time in the kitchen. A MorningConsult survey conducted shortly after COVID first struck in early 2020 found that 46% of Americans were cooking more.

Options: Should You Buy Groceries at the Dollar Store?

More time spent in the kitchen means more money spent on the kitchen. Many have been dumping dollars into upgrading their kitchens as well as overhauling their aesthetic. Even those who haven’t been making drastic changes to their cooking spaces may also be dishing out more dough (pun not intended) than they did in pre-pandemic times. So a few bucks here on mason jars and a few bucks there on measuring cups can add up.

With that in mind is shopping at dollar stores the best way to save on kitchen products? It depends. Let’s explore which items are must-buys and which are best bought at more renowned retailers.

Coffee Filters

“Unbleached coffee filters can cost two to three times as much at Walmart and Amazon while bleached ones can reach up to five times pricier than their dollar-store price” said Nunzio Ross founder and CEO at Majesty Coffee. “It’s an essential kitchen item for people who brew their coffees at home and they don’t have to be expensive.”

Mason Jars

“You won’t find a better deal on Mason jars of all sizes anywhere else” said Elyse Moody a kitchen design expert at Designer Appliances. I like buying the really large ones for iced teas and lemonade (or preserved lemons) medium ones for storing tomato sauce and small ones for leftover soups sauces or smoothies.

You can find an extensive variety of low-price Mason jars at Dollar Tree.

Bench Scraper

“You can find stainless steel bench scrapers for $1.25 at Dollar Tree and these are some multi-use tools that many home chefs of all skill levels swear by” said Julie Ramhold consumer analyst at DealNews.com. “These are good for dividing up dough as well as scraping counters down after working with dough or even chopping certain ingredients like homemade pasta.”

Funnel Sets

“Whatever you need them for you can find a 3-pack at dollar stores that will be cheap but effective” Ramhold said.

A 3-pack of plastic funnels goes for $1.25 at Dollar Tree.

Decorative Toothpicks and Forks

“If you enjoy entertaining and having small versions of snack foods for guests to feast on the decorative toothpicks and forks at dollar stores are a great alternative to a standard pack of toothpicks” Ramhold said. “As they’re super affordable you’ll be able to dress up your menu with little effort and cost.”

Story continues

Packages of decorative toothpicks and forks retail for $1.25 each at Dollar Tree.

Measuring Cups

“One caveat about purchasing measuring cups from dollar stores is that the markings may rub off over time so you may find that you have to replace them” Ramhold said. “Still if you need them for a specific project or don’t mind having to buy more after a time you can’t beat the price.”

A 4-set of measuring cups goes for $1.25 at Dollar Tree.

Bamboo Kitchen Utensils

“Bamboo utensils are more sanitary than plastic and more eco-friendly as well” said Dominic HarperTitle founder of Debt Bombshell. “You don’t even have to worry about the disposal because you can just plant it in your backyard and it will degrade easily making it a very sustainable alternative.”

Glass Drinkware

“You can find glass drinkware for much less than big box stores and specialty kitchen retailers — plus styles are very similar” said budgeting expert Andrea Woroch. “For example you can snag this 20.5 ounce stemless wineglass for $1.25 at the Dollar Tree versus a similar yet smaller version at Target for $3.”

Plastic Storage Containers

“Here’s a 3-count plastic food storage container set from Walmart for $3.72 but you can find a similar option at Dollar Tree for just $1.25 at a savings of nearly $2.50” Woroch said.

Kitchen Items To Avoid Buying at the Dollar Store

Timers

“Specifically the digital timers as the batteries may be hard to replace” Ramhold said. “Sure you can toss that one out and buy another but over time that adds up. Plus timers these days are kind of redundant given that most people can do timers on their smartphones as well as employ smart assistants to keep track for them.”

Vegetable Peelers

“They’re definitely affordable but they’re usually a mix of metal and plastic and there’s a good chance that the plastic parts can break which means you’ll have to toss the whole thing anyway” Ramhold said.

Pizza Cutters

“The design of pizza cutters in general isn’t great and cheese and toppings can get stuck in certain parts but purchasing from dollar stores means you’ll likely be buying one that’s plastic and metal” Ramhold said. “The metal may not be sharp enough to cut your pizza but again if the plastic breaks you’ll have to toss the whole tool.”

Bakeware

“It’ll depend on what they’re made of but you may want to skip bakeware at dollar stores” Ramhold said. “They may not conduct heat well which means you could end up with uneven browning on your baked foods and depending on the quality of nonstick coating you may end up having to do extra greasing when you don’t want to. Additionally these pans are likely to stain really easily so if you care about the look of your bakeware these may not be the best option.”

Oven Mitts

“Prices on oven mitts are tempting at the dollar store but this is one item you should skip because quality will be lacking and can prove to be dangerous” Woroch said. “You won’t have as much protection from home hot surfaces or baking dishes when using cheaply made oven mitts so spend more. One way to save and still get quality is to buy oven mitts from HomeGoods or Marshalls where you get brand name items for up to 60% less.”

Knives

“The knives available at the dollar store are blunt; they can’t even cut through an apple without bending in half” said Johan Liebert shopping expert and CEO at DazzDeals.

Knives are one of those items that are almost always worth spending more on. You can usually find your basics for a decent price but you can always level up (to an insane degree even) by heading over to Williams Sonoma where top-of-the-line knives easily go for over $500.

Graters and Slicers

“For the same reason you want to avoid [dollar store] knives you want to avoid cheaply made graters and slicers because they will be dull and not function to get your food prep done well” Woroch said. “Pick up a brand name better quality option for these kitchen items from Amazon or Walmart to save.”

The family of late actor Bill Paxton has reached something of a settlement in the lawsuit they filed after his untimely death in 2017. Paxton’s family filed a lawsuit against General Anesthesia Specialists Partnership a year after his passing claiming wrongful death and that the attending Dr. Ali Khoynezhad had allegedly used “high-risk and unconventional” techniques. Now the medical group has agreed to pay Paxton’s wife and children a $1 million dollar settlement while also denying liability for the actor’s death. It is actually quite common for settlements to occur without any party acknowledging guilt or culpability but apparently General Anesthesia Specialists Partnership has done so in part to not spend more money and time in litigation.

In February of 2017 Bill Paxton underwent an open heart surgery to repair a valve that had been weakened by a childhood bout of rheumatic fever as well as correct an aneurysm. The next day he had to go in for a second emergency surgery. Ten days later of deteriorating health he had a stroke and died at the relatively young age of 21. Paxton’s family’s lawsuit claimed that the surgeon Dr. Ali Khoynezhad had not been in the operating room when he suffered complications and that the doctor’s alleged “cowboy” style of medical practice had taken unnecessary risks. While the $1 million settlement has been agreed to a Los Angeles judge has also ruled that the Paxton family can continue to pursue punitive damages against Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for attempting to cover-up wrongful death. Their lawsuit includes the allegation that the hospital willfully did not perform an autopsy on Paxton and misled the cremation service as part of an attempt to disguise the nature of his death.

Bill Paxton in Aliens (1986)

Bill Paxton had a long and storied film career often playing a buffoonish or overconfident figure. Some of his earliest major roles were as an unpleasant jock of an older brother who gets transformed into a hideous monster in John Hughes’ Weird Science and as Hollywood’s idea of a teen punk who gets killed by Arnold Schwarzenegger in the original Terminator. That was the beginning of a long partnership with director James Cameron who would cast Paxton in Aliens True Lies and Titanic. In addition the actor appeared in Near Dark the directorial debut of Cameron’s spouse at the time Kathryn Bigelow. Paxton also had the notable distinction of being the only actor to have been killed by three of the most iconic villains of science fiction cinema being offed in Terminator Aliens and Predator 2. As if all of that didn’t distinguish the actor enough he was also present as a child in Dallas when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated as later confirmed by photos of him on his father’s shoulders in the crowd.

While this partial settlement in the lawsuit concerning Bill Paxton’s death seems to be complete the lawsuit against Cedars-Sinai Medical Center has still not begun. It is set to go to court in September of 2022. We’ll keep you updated. RIP Bill Paxton."
DLTR,Dollar Tree,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZmFtaWx5LWRvbGxhci1yYXQtaW5mZXN0YXRpb24taW5ldml0YWJsZS1naXZlbi1zdG9jay1waWxlLXVwLWV4cGVydC0yMDIyLTLSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2ZhbWlseS1kb2xsYXItcmF0LWluZmVzdGF0aW9uLWluZXZpdGFibGUtZ2l2ZW4tc3RvY2stcGlsZS11cC1leHBlcnQtMjAyMi0yP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Family Dollar rat infestation inevitable given stock pile-up: expert,"Insider found boxes stacked up at a Dollar Tree store in Bushwick Brooklyn this during a visit this year. Insider/Brittany Chang

FDA inspectors found a rat infestation at one of Family Dollar's distribution centers.

This led to Family Dollar closing more than 400 stores.

A retail consultant told Insider that inventory pile-ups and staffing shortages could be to blame.

Family Dollar closed 404 stores this week after a US government agency investigation found 1000 rodents at one of its distribution centers in Arkansas. The company on Friday announced that it was gradually reopening some of the stores.

According to the US Food and Drug Administration inspectors reported finding live rodents dead rodents in various states of decay rodent feces and dead birds in the building. Recalls were issued on certain items sold at its stores that were serviced by this distribution center; days later these stores closed altogether.

News of these infestations didn't come as a surprise to everyone however. Scott Mushkin CEO of consultancy firm R5 Capital told Insider that his team's recent visits to more than 50 of Family Dollar's parent company's stores Dollar Tree highlighted issues with chaotic backrooms and inventory pileups that could lead to rodent infestations.

""To call it chaotic is an understatement there were inventory mountains"" he said on a recent call. ""I've never seen anything like what we witnessed in those back rooms … there was plenty of cover for rodents to move around.""

Mushkin's team created a report after visiting 50 Dollar Tree stores which was shared with investment analysts and reviewed by Insider. The report shows stacks of boxes piled high in stock rooms at various Dollar Tree stores across the US.

Dollar Tree did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

""Store after store there were piles of inventory. In our opinion there is a very low probability that the company fully understands its inventory position at the stores"" the report said.

This paints a similar picture to what Insider found during store visits to two of Dollar Tree's Brooklyn locations in 2022 and 2018 where boxes were stacked up in the middle of the store or left to be unloaded on abandoned crates.

Mushkin said the inventory pile-ups he witnessed could be down to supply chain challenges and stock arriving all at once or staffing issues because of the labor crunch.

Gabriella Santaniello analyst and founder of retail research firm A-Line Partners echoed these sentiments.

""The stores are understaffed sometimes with only two people working so it isn't unrealistic that things like a rat infestation might go unchecked for a long time. They just don't have the bandwidth to deal with it. It's a sad reality"" she said.

It's not only the Dollar Tree group that has issues with unsafe box stacking in its stores (and a lack of staff to deal with it). Its main competitor Dollar General has faced over $3.6 million in proposed penalties from the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration since 2016 over issues of worker safety in its stores.







OSHA said in a press release this week that inspectors found examples of ""willful violations"" of employee safety at some of its stores last summer including stacking boxes in ""an unsafe manner"" and blocking exit routes.

While untidy stores haven't discouraged shoppers so far – dollar stores continue to grow at a rapid rate in the US and thrived during the pandemic – analysts say that recent reports of pest control issues are likely to be more damaging.

""The low price proposition of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar does result in trade-offs. No one expects the stores to be luxuriously appointed to have fantastic merchandising or to offer top-notch service"" Neil Saunders managing director of GlobalData Retail said in a note to Insider.

He continued: However basic hygiene including pest control is an expectation. I think most shoppers will find the latest headlines distasteful no matter how low the prices or how low the discounts are.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjE0bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8yNi9vbmUtcGVyc29uLWFycmVzdGVkLWFmdGVyLWJ1cmdsYXJ5LWRvbGxhci10cmVlL9IBYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjE0bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8yNi9vbmUtcGVyc29uLWFycmVzdGVkLWFmdGVyLWJ1cmdsYXJ5LWRvbGxhci10cmVlLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,One person arrested after burglary at Dollar Tree,"EVANSVILLE Ind. (WFIE) - The Evansville Police Department responded to a burglary report early Saturday morning at Dollar Tree on Diamond Avenue.

Dispatch says the call came in as a commercial burglary around 6:12 a.m.

EPD says when they arrived they found a front window to the store had been shattered.

Officials believe the person used a shopping cart to break the glass and enter the store.

That person was later identified as Jeffery Miller.

Over the past two years due to the pandemic much of the population has been spending a lot more time in the kitchen. A MorningConsult survey conducted shortly after COVID first struck in early 2020 found that 46% of Americans were cooking more.

More time spent in the kitchen means more money spent on the kitchen. Many have been dumping dollars into upgrading their kitchens as well as overhauling their aesthetic. Even those who haven’t been making drastic changes to their cooking spaces may also be dishing out more dough (pun not intended) than they did in pre-pandemic times. So a few bucks here on mason jars and a few bucks there on measuring cups can add up.

With that in mind is shopping at dollar stores the best way to save on kitchen products? It depends. Let’s explore which items are must-buys and which are best bought at more renowned retailers.

Coffee Filters

“Unbleached coffee filters can cost two to three times as much at Walmart and Amazon while bleached ones can reach up to five times pricier than their dollar-store price” said Nunzio Ross founder and CEO at Majesty Coffee. “It’s an essential kitchen item for people who brew their coffees at home and they don’t have to be expensive.”

Mason Jars

“You won’t find a better deal on Mason jars of all sizes anywhere else” said Elyse Moody a kitchen design expert at Designer Appliances. I like buying the really large ones for iced teas and lemonade (or preserved lemons) medium ones for storing tomato sauce and small ones for leftover soups sauces or smoothies.

You can find an extensive variety of low-price Mason jars at Dollar Tree.

Bench Scraper

“You can find stainless steel bench scrapers for $1.25 at Dollar Tree and these are some multi-use tools that many home chefs of all skill levels swear by” said Julie Ramhold consumer analyst at DealNews.com. “These are good for dividing up dough as well as scraping counters down after working with dough or even chopping certain ingredients like homemade pasta.”

Funnel Sets

“Whatever you need them for you can find a 3-pack at dollar stores that will be cheap but effective” Ramhold said.

A 3-pack of plastic funnels goes for $1.25 at Dollar Tree.

Decorative Toothpicks and Forks

“If you enjoy entertaining and having small versions of snack foods for guests to feast on the decorative toothpicks and forks at dollar stores are a great alternative to a standard pack of toothpicks” Ramhold said. “As they’re super affordable you’ll be able to dress up your menu with little effort and cost.”

Packages of decorative toothpicks and forks retail for $1.25 each at Dollar Tree.

Measuring Cups

“One caveat about purchasing measuring cups from dollar stores is that the markings may rub off over time so you may find that you have to replace them” Ramhold said. “Still if you need them for a specific project or don’t mind having to buy more after a time you can’t beat the price.”

A 4-set of measuring cups goes for $1.25 at Dollar Tree.

Bamboo Kitchen Utensils

“Bamboo utensils are more sanitary than plastic and more eco-friendly as well” said Dominic HarperTitle founder of Debt Bombshell. “You don’t even have to worry about the disposal because you can just plant it in your backyard and it will degrade easily making it a very sustainable alternative.”

Glass Drinkware

“You can find glass drinkware for much less than big box stores and specialty kitchen retailers — plus styles are very similar” said budgeting expert Andrea Woroch. “For example you can snag this 20.5 ounce stemless wineglass for $1.25 at the Dollar Tree versus a similar yet smaller version at Target for $3.”

Plastic Storage Containers

“Here’s a 3-count plastic food storage container set from Walmart for $3.72 but you can find a similar option at Dollar Tree for just $1.25 at a savings of nearly $2.50” Woroch said.

Kitchen Items To Avoid Buying at the Dollar Store

Timers

“Specifically the digital timers as the batteries may be hard to replace” Ramhold said. “Sure you can toss that one out and buy another but over time that adds up. Plus timers these days are kind of redundant given that most people can do timers on their smartphones as well as employ smart assistants to keep track for them.”

Vegetable Peelers

“They’re definitely affordable but they’re usually a mix of metal and plastic and there’s a good chance that the plastic parts can break which means you’ll have to toss the whole thing anyway” Ramhold said.

Pizza Cutters

“The design of pizza cutters in general isn’t great and cheese and toppings can get stuck in certain parts but purchasing from dollar stores means you’ll likely be buying one that’s plastic and metal” Ramhold said. “The metal may not be sharp enough to cut your pizza but again if the plastic breaks you’ll have to toss the whole tool.”

Bakeware

“It’ll depend on what they’re made of but you may want to skip bakeware at dollar stores” Ramhold said. “They may not conduct heat well which means you could end up with uneven browning on your baked foods and depending on the quality of nonstick coating you may end up having to do extra greasing when you don’t want to. Additionally these pans are likely to stain really easily so if you care about the look of your bakeware these may not be the best option.”

Oven Mitts

“Prices on oven mitts are tempting at the dollar store but this is one item you should skip because quality will be lacking and can prove to be dangerous” Woroch said. “You won’t have as much protection from home hot surfaces or baking dishes when using cheaply made oven mitts so spend more. One way to save and still get quality is to buy oven mitts from HomeGoods or Marshalls where you get brand name items for up to 60% less.”

Knives

“The knives available at the dollar store are blunt; they can’t even cut through an apple without bending in half” said Johan Liebert shopping expert and CEO at DazzDeals.

Knives are one of those items that are almost always worth spending more on. You can usually find your basics for a decent price but you can always level up (to an insane degree even) by heading over to Williams Sonoma where top-of-the-line knives easily go for over $500.

Graters and Slicers

“For the same reason you want to avoid [dollar store] knives you want to avoid cheaply made graters and slicers because they will be dull and not function to get your food prep done well” Woroch said. “Pick up a brand name better quality option for these kitchen items from Amazon or Walmart to save.”

Dollar General plans to build a fourth in the same area.

An online petition to stop the Dollar General being built created by locals reached more than 1100 signatures with the goal of 1500. Jenny Wilds was one of those who signed.

Wilds whose property sits on the corner of Rowland Road and U.S. 70 said while she's not necessarily concerned about having a Dollar General across from her home she has concerns about how traffic will be impacted with her home being so close to the only entrance point.

Lights will shine through her window and trucks will likely have to swing into her yard to make the corner Wilds said.

""The orientation of the driveway is my main concern at this point"" Wilds said. ""There have been multiple accidents on that corner already.""

With ArtSpace Charter School located beside the store site Wilds said there's multiple times a day when traffic is blocked. She said the addition of a store would only make traffic worse.

The primary concerns for ArtSpace staff relate to the safety of the students. Located on U.S. 70 executive director Sarena Fuller said she recognizes the impact the school already has on the residential community and that the school has already invested in traffic handling to minimize impact.

In addition to the heavy traffic in the area Fuller said although there has been recent residential development there has been little to no pedestrian accommodation.

""The only sidewalks that exist are on our school property"" Fuller said. ""I'm worried about pedestrian traffic through our campus.""

Fuller cited recent rumors of violence at Dollar Generals throughout the county worrying about the proximity to ArtSpace. She said she spoke with the contractors about safety measures but there's no denying that no matter the business on the site traffic would increase in the area.

The site a former wooded lot was once a bike park for residents used also by students after school according to Fuller. She said it was sad to see the area leveled for a commercial business.

""We have expressed our concerns to county commissioners"" Fuller said. ""We have looked at that property before hoping that if it went up for sale that we might be able to purchase it.""

Unfortunately for ArtSpace the lot wasn't on the market long enough for the school to purchase it.

The new Swannanoa Dollar General falls under commercial county zoning laws meaning it does not require public input to be built. The only possible alternative would have been to apply for an appeal with the Board of Adjustment but at this late stage the time for an appeal has passed.

According to county planning directory Nathan Pennington the permit for the site was issued on Dec. 28. An appeal would have had to have been submitted within 30 days of the issued permit along with $500 paid to the county with the submitted appeal.

Pennington stressed the seriousness of an administrative appeal saying residents would need to seek legal counsel and be in contact with the county's legal department.

""They would have to demonstrate that staff erred in the issuance of whatever permit they're appealing"" Pennington said. ""You'd have to demonstrate what part of the code you think was misapplied.""

Although she consulted legal counsel Wilds said she was advised against pursuing legal action. Fuller took a similar approach in contacting the county commissioners but found the developers are in accordance with every zoning law.

The store development comes two years into an expansion on the ArtSpace campus. Fuller said the school worked with NCDOT and various traffic analysts to ensure the relationship with the surrounding area was manageable.

ArtSpace has a student population of roughly 400. The petition cites potential risk to the campus as well as the residential community due to the likely increase of traffic.

Residents continue to gather signatures for the petition addressed to Pennington though whether or not the county will take action remains to be seen.

""I can't do anything with a petition"" Pennington said.

The building of a new Dollar General is not uncommon in North Carolina. Across the state on average in 2020 a new location opened every eight days.

In New Bern at the opposite end of the state six stores line a single street with two directly across from one another. On Patton Avenue in Asheville a Dollar Tree and Family Dollar sit directly adjacent to each other.

Currently North Carolina has 930 Dollar General stores more than all but three states in the country.

Stock market corrections can be challenging for investors. The uncertainty makes it tough to know if your stocks will make it through. That's why it's a good idea to make sure you own companies built to endure tough times.

We asked some of our contributors for their favorite stocks to own when times gets tough. Here's why they believe Dominion Energy (D 0.02%) Nucor (NUE -1.67%) and NextEra Energy (NEE 1.58%) are great to hold and even add to when the stock market gets turbulent.

Boring on purpose

Reuben Gregg Brewer (Dominion Energy): Once many years ago Dominion Energy was a widely diversified energy company with oil drilling assets a midstream business and a utility all under one roof. In an effort to simplify its business and minimize risk it has pared its portfolio down to just utilities. This is a regulated business in which Dominion has to justify its rates to regulators and in exchange is granted a monopoly in the areas where it operates.

That makes Dominion a very reliable business given that electricity is basically one of the most important things supporting modern life. Sure demand tends to fall in times of economic weakness but not that much. It is a boring safe stock now that its multiyear transformation has been completed.

But what do investors get now? For starters a fairly generous dividend yield of 3.3% or so. Although the dividend was cut in 2020 that was because of the sale of its midstream business to Berkshire Hathaway.

That sale allowed Dominion to solidify its balance sheet and set it up for more-reliable and robust dividend growth. The goal is to increase the dividend at an annual rate of 6% through 2025 backed by capital investment totaling around $32 billion. Because of the importance of electricity and the regulated nature of the utility sector that spending or at least most of it will take place even if there's a bear market or a recession.

So you can focus on the dividends you are collecting instead of the market turbulence. And if Dominion's shares take a hit too you might even consider bulking up your position so you can collect even more of the growing dividend from what is now a utility-focused business.

Any drop in this stock's price is an opportunity

Neha Chamaria (Nucor): Nucor is the kind of stock that could take a big hit during a market downturn but it's also one stock you'd not only want to hold throughout but even buy while it's still cheap.

I'll give you two reasons: Nucor is one of the most well run and established players in an industry vital to the economy so its stock price is also likely to bottom out quickly once the market bounces back. And in between Nucor should help you earn passive income in the form of a regular dividend which now yields about 1.7%.

In fact Nucor doesn't just pay a regular dividend but is a Dividend Aristocrat that has increased its dividend every year for the last 49 years (leaving it one year away from Dividend King status). Last December Nucor increased its dividend by a solid 23% as the company's profits and cash flows expanded -- 2021 was a record year for Nucor.

With spending on infrastructure on the rise under the Biden administration demand for Nucor's steel products should remain strong. The company is already looking forward to a strong year and there's no reason it won't be able to increase its dividend yet again this year. Given the backdrop you'd want to consider any drop in Nucor's stock price in a market downturn as an opportunity to own a rock-solid infrastructure stock.

A safe haven when the market gets shaky

Matt DiLallo (NextEra Energy): NextEra Energy has one of the lowest-risk business models around. Its Florida-based electric utility generates relatively stable earnings by distributing energy to end-users under government-regulated rates. Meanwhile its clean-energy infrastructure business produces steady cash flow by selling power to other utilities and large electricity consumers secured by long-term fixed-rate contracts.

Adding to NextEra Energy's overall stability is its financial profile. It has a conservative dividend payout ratio for a utility and has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector. That gives it the financial flexibility to continue expanding its operations in Florida and its renewable energy business.

The company already has enough expansion-related investments to grow its earnings per share by 10% this year. Meanwhile it sees earnings growth coming in at or near the upper end of its long-term target range of 6% to 8% annually through 2025. Powering that growth is the company's rising backlog of renewable energy development projects and investments to enhance its utility in Florida. This forecast supports the company's belief that it can increase its dividend by around a 10% annual rate through 2024.

“I am 100% convinced that if Russia is not stopped in Ukraine and Kyiv falls then the next target is Moldova Georgia then troubles will be caused in the Western Balkans then the Baltic States are the next target” he said echoing the words of the EU’s chief diplomat Josep Borrell.

Janša also warned of a ‘domino effect’ should Russia succeed with its invasion.

Slovenia’s prime minister said it is crucial that “Europe should learn something from its history” referencing appeasement policy during World War II and the Yugoslav wars.

Comparing Russian President Vladimir Putin to nefarious figures from Europe’s recent history he said “there is no such formula to work with people thinking like Hitler or Stalin. We have to stop them at the beginning.”

He also explained that while there are some “bizarre similarities” between Putin and ex-Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic and Europe could expect “the same irrational moves when things are not going to plan” Russia is not Yugoslavia and is a nuclear power.

Despite this Janša was clear that it is essential to halt Russia in its tracks as soon as possible.

“It is costly with the sanctions the military aid it is not without casualties – but the price at stopping him [Putin] now is a thousand times less than the price we would pay if we let him take Ukraine” he said.

Asked whether those that have not joined sanctions (notably Serbia) and condemnation efforts will be judged by history Janša said: “Everybody has to decide”.

“It’s something similar as to when Nazi Germany attacked Poland and I don’t think we have should risk failing as the West failed at that moment”

EU candidate status

Earlier this week Janša and his Polish counterpart Mateusz Morawiecki called on EU member states to take “quick and courageous decisions” speaking out in favour of Ukraine joining the EU by 2030. Similar comments have been made by several Eastern European leaders and most recently the EU’s leadership.

The Slovenian prime minister said a half-an-hour discussion with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy “changed the mood favourably towards the European perspective of Ukraine much more than thousands of meetings speaking about the same issue in the past”.

Zelenskiy had reportedly made a passionate plea to EU leaders for bloc membership on Thursday (28 February) telling them that “this might be the last time you see me alive.”

In what some have rated as the EU executive’s clearest commitments so far European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen stressed on Sunday (28 February) Ukraine belongs in the EU and the bloc wants the country to join.

“The moment to think about strategic changes that are on the table is now because the public opinion in Western Europe is changing” Janša said.

“This has to be a strategic political answer of the EU to the current challenges. What was not possible one week ago is possible now” he added.

With Kyiv’s growing ties to the West a thorn in the side of Moscow those remarks are likely to anger Putin who has claimed a historical oneness between the Russian and Ukrainian peoples as one of his justifications for his unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.

“I am very glad that after sending this letter with Polish Prime Minister Morawiecki we had quite a discussion in the European Council and also some colleagues from the West joined into this” Janša said.

But while Ukraine is not an official candidate for EU accession talks calls for enlargement of the bloc have fallen on deaf ears in Brussels and across EU capitals.

“Those discussions about enlargement in the past decade were very out date: ‘They are not fulfilling the conditions’ ‘they’re not controlling their own territory’ and so on – this was the Russian narrative this is why Russia started these frozen conflicts” he said.

“Speaking about the European perspective for Ukraine is not only about giving them a perspective of prosperity after 10 or 15 years but it also’s about giving them hope and the feeling that they belong to the family – and there is a family that is fighting for them” Janša said.

‘Battle of narratives’

The US’ pre-emptive intelligence strikes and Russia’s staged TV moments were a part of the ‘battle of narratives’ since Russia decided to invade Ukraine.

Asked whether he believes whether public pressure is having an impact on Moscow’s actions Janša said “the Kremlin was not aware that everybody now can report and that it’s not possible to fight with the same old Soviet-style propaganda.”

Comparing the situation to the Yugoslav wars Janša said Western countries had not been prepared to address what eventually happened.

“But the media were prepared – and it’s the same in Ukraine now” he said adding: “Without the media attention Ukraine would not have many chances.”

“When then people around the globe can see the suffering consider the difference between those who are attacking and those who are defending themselves the situation is changing” he added.

Ukrainian refugees

The United Nations’ refugee agency (UNHCR) says it plans to deal with up to four million Ukrainian refugees if the situation worsens. Still European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarčič had said he estimates the figure could reach seven million.

“Slovenia is of course prepared to take its share; we had a similar situation after the Bosnian war” Janša said when asked whether the country would commit to taking in Ukrainian refugees.

However he stressed that those fleeing Ukraine “are not migrants but refugees” adding that the EU leaders had been “united in such an assessment” when discussing the matter last week.

Asked whether this would be the time to reopen the discussions about the EU’s stalled migration pact Janša said the bloc should finish the debate that could not be completed in the past years.

“But it’s not possible to conclude the discussion on the difference between economic migrants and refugees these are two different categories” he added.

Officers were called to Domino’s 329 Nottingham Rd. to speak with the driver who had just been robbed while on a delivery Syracuse police spokesman Lt. Matthew Malinowski said Saturday in a news release.

The driver told police he was in the 100 block of McClure Avenue when a man with a gun walked up to him and threatened him Malinowski said.

The armed man then stole food and ran from the area Malinowski said. Initial Onondaga County 911 Center dispatch reports indicated the man stole about $50 worth of food.

The delivery driver was not injured during the robbery Malinowski said.

Police ask anyone with information about the armed robbery to call the Syracuse Police Department at 315-442-5222.

Faced with the now familiar dilemma of her work-from-home setup encroaching on the rest of her open-concept living room Sally Smallwood did the one thing she could: She went to IKEA and bought a room divider. But while the collage artist’s emails were no longer staring at her after-hours the plain black screen left a lot be desired on the design front.



Smallwood has decoupaged canvases and plates galore but it was only when she couldn’t look at the Risör screen any longer that a lightbulb went off: She could apply her skill set to its plastic panels. With the help of leftover Fine & Dandy Co. wallpaper from a previous collage project—Smallwood has always lusted after the old-world look of chinoiserie silk screens—her 9-to-5 solution is no longer an eyesore.

The Supplies

IKEA Risör room divider

All-purpose cleaner

Rags

Small sponge roller

Primer (Smallwood recommends this one)

Black chalk paint

2 rolls wallpaper of your choice

Cutting mat (a kitchen cutting board works too)

Ruler

Pencil

X-Acto knife

PVA glue (white or clear)

Flat-bristle craft brush (like this one)

Squeegee or credit card

Step 1: Prep and Prime

The divider comes preassembled. Wipe down each of the plastic pieces with an all-purpose cleaner and be sure to thoroughly dry them with a clean rag. Coat the front of each piece with a plastic-suitable primer in order to help the adhesive stick better later on. Leave a few hours after painting so they can dry.

Step 2: Paint the Panel Backs

Because the plastic is a tad transparent Smallwood painted each panel with black chalk paint but any black paint will do—or really any color your heart desires. This creates a much cleaner less blotchy finish.

Step 3: Trace Each Panel

Unroll your wallpaper with the pattern facing down and trace out the measurements of each square. Number the corresponding rectangles in order of how they’ll be glued onto the frame (Smallwood worked top to bottom). If you’re using a geometric or abstract print you don’t have to worry about the numbering but it’s crucial for keeping scenic print or large repeats continuous across the panels.

Step 4: Trim the Wallpaper

Cut out each square on a cutting board or mat using a ruler and X-Acto knife. It’s important to be as precise as you can so there won’t be little bits of plastic peeking out.

Step 5: Apply the Pattern

Apply a thin but generous amount of PVA glue (a more durable option than traditional craft adhesives) to the plastic. Carefully lay the corresponding wallpaper cutting on top. Use a squeegee or credit card and smooth it flat working from the center outward. If there are any pesky air bubbles lift up the wallpaper and reapply it; the glue won’t dry right away. Although it will fully set within two to three hours allow the PVA to cure fully overnight. Put the divider back in its rightful spot. Emails?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 166.15 points or about 0.49% but closed well off session lows at 33892.60. The S&P 500 closed down 0.24% at 4373.94 while the Nasdaq rallied late in the session for a gain of 0.41% to 13751.40.

Monday's moves capped off a rough February for stocks with the major averages all posting sharp monthly losses.

The volatile session came amid turmoil over the conflict between Russia and Ukraine where Ukrainian forces have held key cities including the capital of Kyiv. Officials from both countries held a round of negotiations near the Belarus border on Monday.

""War is fundamentally a 'risk off' environment for risky assets as global investors move into sovereign bonds and other 'safe havens' until some kind of conclusion/new normal becomes priced in. ... Everything about this is unprecedented so about the only rational thing to say about equities is to expect volatility to continue pending a resolution"" Raymond James strategist Tavis McCourt said in a note.

Defense stocks like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman rose 6.7% and 7.9% respectively. Cybersecurity stocks also outperformed with Crowdstrike jumping 7.4% helping limit losses for the Nasdaq.

Bank stocks were under pressure with JPMorgan falling 4.2% and Citigroup dropping 4.4%.

Government bond yields were sharply lower across the curve with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note most recently at 1.83% off 15 basis points on the session. A basis point is 0.01%; yields move opposite prices and were lower amid high demand for safe-haven bonds.

The lower bond yields may have helped the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite outperform as growth-oriented stocks tend to perform better when rates are low. Shares of Tesla rose 7.5% on Monday.

Currency markets were a major area of volatility on Monday. The Central Bank of Russia more than doubled its key interest rate to 20% from 9.5% in reaction to a currency move that saw the ruble tumble nearly 22% against the U.S. dollar. The ruble hit a record low against the dollar early Monday.

Over the weekend the U.S. joined allies in Europe and Canada in moving to bar key Russian banks from the interbank messaging system SWIFT. The system connects more than 11000 banks and financial institutions in more than 200 countries and territories.

Additionally the U.S. and European allies have also taken action against Russia's central bank effectively freezing the country's foreign reserves.

The sanctions in financial markets had some investors and traders looking for potential disruptions outside of Russian markets.

""Some Russian banks being removed from SWIFT (energy transactions exempt) and the freezing of the Russian central bank's access to its foreign currency reserves held in the West clearly increases economic tail risk"" said Dennis DeBusschere of 22V Research.

However DeBusschere pointed out that Russia can still sell oil and said there could be ""loop holes"" in Russia's frozen assets which ""might limit the disaster in markets for a few days.""

Meanwhile Russian military vehicles entered Ukraine's second-largest city Kharkiv with reports of fighting taking place and residents being warned to stay in shelters. Russian President Vladimir Putin put his country's nuclear deterrence forces on high alert Sunday amid a growing global backlash against the invasion.

Monday marks the final day of trading for February and even with a strong rally at the end of last week the three major U.S. averages all fell more than 3% for the month. The Dow was the worst performer falling 3.5% for its worst month since November.

Stocks particularly the tech-heavy Nasdaq were already in a downturn before the invasion of Ukraine.

The conflict comes ""on top of our base case which is that we were already potentially headed for a bear market due to valuations rising rates and inflation and the lack of a Fed put"" said Phillip Toews CEO of Toews Asset Management.

""Now is not a great outlook for the markets despite some short-term rallies like we saw last week"" Toews added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8yNy9pbnRsX2J1c2luZXNzL25vcndheS1zb3ZlcmVpZ24tZnVuZC1ydXNzaWEvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBTWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjIvMDIvMjcvaW50bF9idXNpbmVzcy9ub3J3YXktc292ZXJlaWduLWZ1bmQtcnVzc2lh?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Norway says its sovereign fund will divest from Russia,"Norway’s $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund the world’s largest will divest its Russian assets following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine the Norwegian prime minister said on Sunday.

The fund’s Russian assets consisting of shares in some 47 companies as well as government bonds were worth 25 billion Norwegian crowns ($2.83 billion) at the end of 2021 down from 30 billion crowns a year earlier the government said.

“We have decided to freeze the fund’s investments and have begun a process of selling out (of Russia)” Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere told a news conference.

At the end of 2020 the last time the fund gave a breakdown of its Russian assets it held government bonds worth 6.7 billion crowns and equities worth 23.3 billion crowns according to Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM).

The most valuable stake in an individual firm at the end of 2020 was in Sberbank where it held 0.83% worth 6 billion crowns at the time making the fund the fourth-largest shareholder according to Refinitiv Eikon data.

The second and third largest stakes at the end of 2020 were in energy firms Gazprom and Lukoil.

A federal grand jury in San Diego indicted the founder of BitConnect for allegedly orchestrating a $2.4 billion global Ponzi scheme the Justice Department said Friday.

Satish Kumbhani 36 is accused of misleading investors about the cryptocurrency’s “lending program” where he claimed the proprietary technology would bring substantive returns to investors by tracking cryptocurrency exchange markets.

“As alleged in the indictment however BitConnect operated as a Ponzi scheme by paying earlier BitConnect investors with money from later investors” the Justice Department said in a statement. Kumbhani and his co-conspirators allegedly made about $2.4 billion in the scheme.

After about a year the statement said the lending program abruptly stopped. Kumbhani’s promoters allegedly propped up the price of BitConnect’s digital currency to create false market demand.

“Crime particularly crime involving digital currencies continues to transcend international boundaries” said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.

Kumbhani is charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud wire fraud conspiracy to commit commodity price manipulation operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiracy to commit international money laundering. He could face up to 70 years in prison.

CNN Business has reached out to Kumbhani for comment.

BitConnect shuttered its exchange in January 2018 after North Carolina and Texas issued cease-and-desist orders to the company over unregistered securities. Last September the SEC charged Kumbhani over his role in the $2 billion fraud. He and Glenn Aracro BitConnect’s top promoter pleaded guilty.

Last November the Justice Department said it would sell $56 million worth of cryptocurrency seized from BitConnect’s top promoter in “the largest single recovery of a cryptocurrency fraud by the United States to date.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8yNi9pbnZlc3RpbmcvYml0Y29pbi1taW5pbmctcmVuZXdhYmxlLWVuZXJneS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFMaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wMi8yNi9pbnZlc3RpbmcvYml0Y29pbi1taW5pbmctcmVuZXdhYmxlLWVuZXJneQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bitcoin is getting even dirtier,"New York CNN Business —

Bitcoin is a pollution-creating mess. Despite efforts to make the energy-intensive mining process friendlier to the environment it has grown significantly more reliant on fossil fuels over the past year.

China’s cryptocurrency mining ban in the spring of 2021 significantly worsened Bitcoin’s environmental impact according to a new research on mining published in Joule. It is because Bitcoin miners were tapping into a significant amount of Chinese hydropower which suddenly evaporated when China made mining illegal said Alex de Vries one of the study’s authors and a researcher at the School of Business and Economics at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

So miners took their business elsewhere including countries using significantly dirtier energy than China. Electricity sources powering the Bitcoin network were just 25.1% renewable in August 2021 nearly 17 percentage points lower than the 2020 average.

Mining Bitcoin each year produces as much pollution as Greece created in 2019 the study found. A single Bitcoin transaction results in the same carbon footprint as a traveler flying from New York to Amsterdam.

“After China banned Bitcoin mining everyone was expecting it to become more green but we are somewhat surprisingly seeing the opposite happening.” said de Vries. “A lot of the hydropower these miners got previously in China has now been replaced with natural gas from the US.”

Bitcoin mining is still booming in the United States. According to the study many of the American Bitcoin mines are powered by natural gas and coal. Kentucky now offers subsidies to crypto miners looking to attract business for the state’s coal industry.

Kazakhstan has also become a destination for Bitcoin miners. According to the study the country’s electricity grid is reliant on hard coal which is even more polluting than the coal used in China.

The hydropower behind China’s Bitcoin mines was often held up by cryptocurrency advocates to rebut criticism about the technology’s environmental impact.

In May Coinbase — one of the largest cryptocurrency marketplaces — published a “fact check” citing China’s hydroelectric plants in trying to undermine the idea Bitcoin contributed to climate change.

Coinbase did not respond to CNN’s questions on whether it stood by its fact check in light of China’s cryptocurrency crackdown but said in a statement it believes “the industry is innovating at an encouraging pace to solve these challenges… Community-led change is possible and crypto can be part of the fight against climate change if we come together to solve these challenges.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8yNi9pbnZlc3Rpbmcvd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHQtYmVya3NoaXJlLWhhdGhhd2F5LXNoYXJlaG9sZGVyLWxldHRlci9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFhaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wMi8yNi9pbnZlc3Rpbmcvd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHQtYmVya3NoaXJlLWhhdGhhd2F5LXNoYXJlaG9sZGVyLWxldHRlcg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway posts nearly $40 billion profit,"New York CNN Business —

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reported a nearly $40 billion profit in the fourth quarter up more than 10% from the same period of 2020. Profits more than doubled for the full year to just shy of $90 billion.

Operating earnings Buffett’s preferred measure of profitability soared 45% in the fourth quarter to $7.3 billion and rose 25% for the full year to about $27.5 billion.

The company added it bought back $6.9 billion worth of stock during the quarter a move which also helped to boost its earnings per share.

Berkshire Hathaway released its latest results Saturday morning along with Buffett’s annual letter to shareholders and details about its in-person shareholder meeting in Omaha at the end of April. Berkshire Hathaway said attendees must show proof of vaccination for Covid-19 to attend.

Berkshire is booming

In the letter Buffett said 2021’s success was in large part due to its “four giants” the company’s insurance operations Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad its massive energy business and Berkshire’s nearly 5.6% stake in Apple (AAPL).

Apple is by far Berkshire’s largest holding and the stock enjoyed a total return (including dividends) of 35% last year. Buffett called Apple CEO Tim Cook “brilliant” in the letter.

Buffett said in the letter investors might be surprised to learn how much Berkshire depends on the American industrial economy for its success. Berkshire also owns Duracell batteries Benjamin Moore paints homebuilder Clayton and flooring company Shaw for example.

“Many people perceive Berkshire as a large and somewhat strange collection of financial assets. In truth Berkshire owns and operates more US-based ‘infrastructure’ assets – classified on our balance sheet as property plant and equipment – than are owned and operated by any other American corporation” Buffett wrote.

Buffett also pointed out Berkshire Hathaway paid $3.3 billion in federal income taxes last year as well as “substantial state and foreign taxes.”

“‘I gave at the office’ is an unassailable assertion when made by Berkshire shareholders” Buffett joked.

Wall Street has rewarded Berkshire for its strong results. The company is now valued at nearly $715 billion and its stock is not far from its all-time high. Berkshire is up 7% this year while the broader market has fallen as investors have flocked to value stocks as safe havens.

Buffett has benefited handsomely as well. His net worth is about $115 billion according to Forbes making him the eighth-richest person on the planet.

Annual meeting is back in Nebraska

Berkshire has nearly $147 billion in cash and generates a big chunk of its profits from Geico and its other insurance businesses. Berkshire’s A shares (BRKA) which famously have not split trade for nearly $480000 apiece.

The class B shares (BRKB) which trade at a more affordable price of around $320 are in the S&P 500 (SPX) and are more widely held by average individual investors.

Many of those shareholders are expected to descend on Omaha during the last weekend of April for Berkshire’s first annual shareholder meeting with attendees since 2019.

The meeting will take place April 30. Berkshire said Saturday Buffett and fellow vice chairman Charlie Munger; Ajit Jain who oversees the insurance operations; and Greg Abel who oversees the conglomerate’s non-insurance businesses will be there in person to answer questions.

The meeting will also be webcast on CNBC. Yahoo Finance had been the online home of the meeting previously.

The company’s 2020 annual meeting was virtual due to the pandemic while the 2021 meeting was held in Los Angeles in order to be closer to the home of longtime Buffett friend and business partner Munger who is 98 and lives in Southern California.

Buffett announced after last year’s virtual shareholder meeting Abel will be his successor as CEO. But Buffett who will turn 92 in August has said nothing about any plans for his own retirement."

Both alternatives call for closing the Bessie Rhodes magnet school.

One option would consolidate the Rhodes programs at the King Arts magnet school and have the new 5th Ward school serve grades K-8. Existing middle school boundaries in color with proposed new boundaries shown as black lines in the option that would have the new 5th Ward school serve K-8 students.

The other option would turn King Arts into a middle school and and have the new 5th Ward school serve grades K-5. Existing middle school boundaries in color with proposed new middle school boundaries as black lines in the option that would turn King Arts into a middle school — the role it served when it was first built as the Skiles Junior High School. Under this scenario the planned 5th Ward school would serve grades K-5.

Under both those options students in the Skokie portion of the district would continue to attend Chute Middle School Devon Horton.

During the webinar unveiling the plans Superintendent Devon Horton said the projected declining enrollment in the district makes consolidation necessary.

He said having more students able to walk to their neighborhood schools will save enough money in reduced busing costs to fund construction of the new 5th Ward school without requiring voter approval of a referendum.

The plan would reverse the district’s half-century-old decision to bus students from the predominantly minority 5th Ward to achieve racial balance in the district.

He added that the Rhodes school has suffered a sharp enrollment decline in recent years and that the building “is pretty much at the end of its life.”

He said the recent Cordogan Clark facilities report indicates it would cost $18 million to replace the Rhodes building and $9.5 million to update and repair it.

“It’s my responsibility and the board’s to make sure we have students and staff in buildings that are safe” Horton said adding that “our most marginalized black and brown students” are in the district’s most dilapidated buildings.

“We can’t keep operating in the same way” the superintendent said. “We’re heading in the wrong direction if we maintain the square footage of space and the enrollment and quality of the buildings continues to decline.”

The proposals are to be presented at two more webinars this week and introduced at a school board committee meeting March 7 with adoption scheduled for the full board meeting March 14.

The changes Horton said would not go into effect until the 2024-25 school year — which would give the district time to build its planned new 5th Ward school.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5raXR2LmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzL2h5YXR0LWhvdGVsLXRvLW9wZW4tZmlmdGgtbG9jYXRpb24taW4td2VzdC1vYWh1L2FydGljbGVfZGRhNGQxMWMtOTZkOC0xMWVjLTk0ZGItZTdhNjQ1ODM0M2JkLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hyatt hotel to open fifth location in West Oahu,"State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

“Our Florida customers deserve a cleaner and smarter energy future. Advancing the use of electric vehicles is a priority for Duke Energy that will benefit our communities and state for generations to come” said Melissa Seixas Duke Energy Florida state president. “This week we are proud to note this significant milestone as we further expand EV charging and reduce carbon emissions in Florida.”

As part of an agreement with the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) Duke launched the program in 2018 to expand access to EV charging stations and continue efforts to offer customers greater reliability cleaner energy alternatives and innovative technology. Since that time more than 600 EV chargers have been installed in easily accessible locations across Florida:

182 public level 2 chargers at local businesses.

52 DC Fast Chargers in public locations.

220 level 2 chargers in multi-unit dwellings.

173 level 2 chargers in workplaces.

The DC Fast Chargers are in strategic locations connecting major and key secondary corridors and evacuation routes in Florida. This creates critical infrastructure needed for EV adoption and helps reduce range anxiety.

S. 19/98 Corridor – Units installed at Apalachicola Dunedin Crystal River Wakulla and Perry. These DC Fast chargers connect the scenic U.S. 19/98 highway from St. Petersburg to Apalachicola.

S. 98 – Three units installed in Chiefland.

S. 27 Corridor – Units installed in Sebring Avon Park and Cagan’s Crossing.

I-4 Corridor – Units installed in Deltona Sea World Champions Gate and U.S. 27 Exit.

Florida Turnpike – Units installed at the Wildwood Exit Turkey Lake Turnpike Service Plaza and Canoe Creek Turnpike Service Plaza.

Duke Energy Florida exceeded its goal for charger installation in low-income-qualified areas with 83 of the stations located in income-qualified census tracts. The company surpassed the PSC requirement of a minimum of 53 stations in low-income-qualified areas.

Additionally the company worked closely with communities so drivers could conveniently explore Florida while charging their vehicles.

For locally-owned businesses the event can help draw in new customers.

“It probably generates maybe 25% of our yearly business” said Jim Light who works with Weaver Barns. “They may not buy it at the show but we'll plant a seed.”

Light said business surged last year even without the Cincinnati Home and Garden Show. He said he thinks it’s partly due to people changing their habits during the pandemic.

The show has been held in Cincinnati for more than 50 years. At the Duke Energy Convention Center more than 350 vendors have come together to show off home and landscaping products from grills to playgrounds to interior design.

“I talked to someone yesterday all he needs is four or five great leads and it carries him through the year for business” said Kelly Scott who serves as the show’s assistant show manager.

Rising prices are still a challenge for the industry however.

“Because of the inflation of everything our buildings have probably gone up 25% In the last two years” he said. “That’s unforeseen.”

Show officials said that’s why the event can be helpful for customers working on home projects.

“If you come here you have the opportunity to meet them work with them and they're the experts” Scott said. “They can really tell you how long it would be or how expensive it would be.”

Tickets start at $12 for adults when purchased online. They are $14 at the door. Children ages 12 and under get in for free.

The show runs until 6 p.m. on Sunday and for four more days the following week starting on Thursday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZheW9ic2VydmVyLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDIvMjYvY3J5cHRvLW1pbmluZy1mYWNpbGl0eS1mYXlldHRldmlsbGUtbmMvNjkzNzM4MTAwMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Crypto mining facility Fayetteville NC,"Ben Sessoms

Carolina Public Press

A new crypto mining facility in Fayetteville will be among the city’s top 10 power consumers when it starts operations in August.

California-based Plan C Crypto will operate an old 20000-square-foot industrial facility located near the Fayetteville Regional Airport. It will operate at 5000 kilowatts according to the company and the Fayetteville Public Works Commission.

PWC doesn’t release specific power consumption information on businesses without consent but the facility’s electrical draw will put it in the company of PWC’s top customers including Cape Fear Valley Medical Center Fayetteville State University Fayetteville Technical Community College and Walmart among others.

Many critics consider the industry’s high carbon emissions to be wasteful contributing to climate change and rising global temperatures.

Lee Reiners a researcher at Duke University who studies financial technologies such as cryptocurrency is among those critical of a business plan for which he sees no legitimate financial utility in its future.

“Cryptocurrency provides no useful economic function” he said. “Anything that is an input into that process is not useful. It is wasteful. That’s my opinion with crypto. There’s no there there.”

Why crypto is so power-hungry

Instead of operating through financial institutions which verify monetary transactions among other things cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin operate outside of this structure.

Cryptocurrency transactions are verified through a process called proof of work where multiple entities on a network will verify withdrawals and deposits in the crypto space in essence cutting out the need for a centralized bank.

This process of verification is called mining and once a majority of computers on the network have confirmed the transactions it’s updated to a public ledger known as the blockchain.

“Everyone has the same exact copy of the ledger and everyone agrees on the canonical state of the ledger” Reiners said. “And that’s made possible by mining.”

Mining is incentivized Reiners said as miners like the one coming to Fayetteville are given a certain amount of bitcoin or whatever cryptocurrency they are mining for participation in the verification process.

“You need to incentivize this mining because otherwise anyone with 51% of the computing power on the blockchain network could just make up whatever they wanted on the ledger” he said.

“So you impose a cost and you impose that cost in the form of energy consumption. You have to solve this complex mathematical puzzle.”

Solving that puzzle is what requires so much energy.

According to reporting from The New York Times last year the collective process of verifying Bitcoin transactions annually uses up more energy than the entire country of Finland.

It’s seven times more than all of Google’s global operations.

‘There’s an opportunity cost to all this’

Plan C Crypto CEO Antonio Bestard said he founded the company as a means to provide more clean energy to the power grid. He said his company would provide an incentive for Fayetteville to buy more energy that is carbon neutral.

“I’m creating an economic need for more green energy on the grid” he said. “We found an economic way to help the city of Fayetteville help green their grid over time.”

When asked Bestard would not specifically say how this process would work beyond imploring Fayetteville to find more green energy.

“We look forward to working with the city of Fayetteville on how they procure power” Bestard said. He said he has asked the city to run the mining facility with 100% clean energy.

And it’s not just Fayetteville. By the time the miner there is up and running Bestard said there will be facilities in Tarboro Wilson and Boone.

But providing exclusively green energy is not something Fayetteville or any of those municipalities can promise.

According to PWC the city purchases almost all of its power from Duke Energy which has a near-monopoly over the power grid in North Carolina.

While Duke Energy has a goal of 50% carbon emissions reduction by 2030 and net-zero by 2050 the company has a long way to go.

In 2020 7% of electricity generated by Duke Energy was wind solar and hydroelectric. The company’s projections have that number at 23% by 2030.

Nuclear energy which is also carbon-free made up 35% of electricity generation in 2020.

That still puts carbon-emitting energy at nearly 60%.

Reiners said the claim that crypto incentivizes green production has no basis.

“I hear this argument a lot” he said. “‘Oh cryptocurrency incentivizes the production of green energy.’ I mean there’s no basis of fact to make that claim.”

Even if Plan C Crypto’s facility operated 100% carbon free Reiners said green energy could be used for something with a legitimate economic purpose.

“There’s an opportunity cost to all this as well” he said.

More revenue for Fayetteville with no investment

While Plan C Crypto’s facility will become one of the top power consumers in Fayetteville Bestard said the miner will not run during peak demand hours when energy consumption and costs are at their highest.

Fayetteville PWC CEO Elaina Ball said no additional infrastructure will be needed to accommodate the mining facility. Most importantly it won’t require any peaker plants large power generating facilities that often use cheaper energy like coal or natural gas during peak hours.

Ball said Plan C Crypto will provide needed revenue due to the high amount of power it will purchase.

“By adding a … 5-megawatt consumer like this what that does is our retail sales are going to go up” she said.

“We’re going to have higher usage 24/7 outside of that window right that peak window. When you generate more revenue off of our system that exists like an industrial customer like this it helps offset the cost to serve residential customers in the long run.”

Robert Van Geons CEO of the Fayetteville Cumberland County Economic Development Corporation or FCEDC said that despite criticisms of the crypto industry the new facility will be good for the area.

“It brings jobs. It brings taxable investment it’s beneficial for our utility system. And ultimately regardless of how you feel about cryptocurrency it is an emerging technology that will continue to evolve” he said. “We’re going to continue to have newer and newer technological innovations in this country and we want those to happen here in Fayetteville and Cumberland County.”

Bestard said the facility will initially employ 19 people targeting military veterans. Those jobs will be in the electrical security and information technology fields.

He said the lowest-paid employees will make $40500 a year while a majority will be in the $60000 to $100000 range.

Bestard said he anticipates dozens more jobs in the coming years.

Van Geons said that no economic incentives were made to Plan C Crypto and there is no financial investment from either the city or county.

Ball said that beyond the typical costs for attaching a new customer in the power grid there will be no significant costs for PWC.

The uncertain future of crypto

In a press release introducing Plan C Crypto to Cumberland the FCEDC cited market statistics projecting cryptocurrency to grow by move than 100% by 2028.

But Reiners said that projected growth is speculative.

“The only reason people buy (cryptocurrency) is they think they can sell it to someone else for a higher price in the future” he said.

“It’s been around for a while. It’s been since 2009. So now we’re 13-plus years. How has it impacted a product a service a process that we all use right? It hasn’t. And so if it hasn’t happened yet you have to ask yourself when it’s going to happen.”

He described the industry as a bubble based solely on the speculative value of what someone else is willing to pay for a product that hasn’t proved its value in his view.

“You’re relying on greater fools showing up and eventually the supply of greater fools is exhausted” Reiners said. “And they don’t show up.”

He said cities like Fayetteville should not be encouraging crypto companies to come to their area in any way.

“Crypto is a cancer” Reiners said. “You’re making a deal with the devil.”

He cited crypto miners buying up cheap carbon-based power in upstate New York as reported by The New York Times.

Reiners said he wouldn’t be surprised if the facility in Fayetteville didn’t exist after five years.

Even if the company fails though Ball said it’s not a risk for the community.

“If I were building a power plant to support this that would be a huge risk but we’re not because they’re not increasing capacity …” she said.

“They’re not increasing the demand. So this is just sales. We’re not putting in a power plant to support this because they can move out of the demand window …

“I know other people in other communities want to have their own perspectives on the industry that’s fine. But I wear the hat of what’s right for our community and our customers and this is good.”

Disrupts Fort Dupont Rink Plans Cannons Practice With Caps Alumni,"From left Paul Mulvey Alan May Neal Henderson Bill Riley Karl Alzner and Peter Bondra. (Caps Outsider)

For years the Fort Dupont Ice Arena was prepping to get a second rink built when just the other day District of Columbia officials delivered the news that put those plans on hold. Told that the project would be far more expensive and take far longer to complete than anticipated Fort Dupont’s board members said they lost confidence in the District’s plans and canceled the current rink’s demolition.

[From The Post: Fort Dupont Ice Rink supporters accuse District of mishandling plans for new arena]

This news came just as the Caps are set to honor Coach Neal Henderson – leader of the country’s oldest minority youth hockey program in the nation – during Monday’s game against the Toronto Maple Leafs where the players will wear helmet decals featuring his likeness.

On Friday Coach Henderson brought his players aged between 7 and 14 to practice at MedStar Capitals Iceplex where they were greeted by Caps alumni Bill Riley (the third Black player in NHL history) Karl Alzner Peter Bondra Alan May Rod Langway and Paul Mulvey.

“I’m interested in knowing what’s going to happen” Coach Henderson said of the new rink. “But as long as the rink is open that’s the happy part for the kids and myself at this time.”

The Capitals raised hundreds of thousands of dollars – including fund-matching by owner Ted Leonsis – for the new rink but now the future of Fort Dupont is unclear.

In related news there’s a documentary about Coach Henderson and the Cannons making the film festival rounds but no word yet on distribution. Not to worry though – the District won’t be handling distribution – so expect to see it in the near future.

“I’m kinda wishing to see it myself to see how it is” Coach Henderson said. “I saw some of it when I was in New York. But I was always in a hurry and people wanting to talk and get more answers than what I could give them. So it’ll be a pleasure to see it.”

In 2019 Henderson became the first Black person to be inducted into the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame. The Capitals last had the opportunity to run an event with the Cannons two years ago right before Covid-19 struck as Caps defensemen Nick Jensen and Jonas Siegenthaler visited their rink.

(AFP Photo)

With less than 10 percent of the plastic used across the world recycled according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) here are five things to know about recycling techniques and how they are evolving.

Mechanical Recycling

Sorting shredding and heating are the three stages of mechanical recycling employed in 99 percent of operations worldwide France's IFP Energies Nouvelles institute says.

After collection and sorting into polymer groups by optical equipment or flotation systems the plastics are washed and crushed into granulated material. They are then melted down and can be re-used.

The technique does not remove additives such as colouring making recycled plastic packaging unsuitable for food. Bin bags are fine.

As a result manufacturers prefer cheap new plastic over the recycled version that is of lower quality and more expensive. What's more a large part of waste plastic from the developed world ends up being dumped abroad NGOs say.

Today the processes are improving particularly with PET or polyethylene terephthalate the most common thermoplastic polymer resin. Poly-condensation allows for the recovery of degraded molecules and the removal of impurities under pressure and heat. Recycled plastic water bottles have recently made their appearance on supermarket shelves in Europe.

A Factory For Each And Every Plastic

Almost every molecule requires a particular type of factory with specialised equipment.

Out of the dozens of plastic polymers polyethylene is the most common and is used to make shampoo bottles and plastic packaging for packs of water bottles which are made of PET. Their tops are made of polypropylene Marc Madec a sustainable development specialist for France's Polyvia Federation of Plastics and Composites told AFP.

Polyvinyl chloride or PVC is used in the construction industry for floor coverings and window frames. Polystyrene can be solid or foamed while polyamide is found in textiles and cars. Polyurethane can be rigid or flexible but is commonly found in mattresses or as insulation.

Such a range requires investment in high-quality sorting equipment to separate out the various plastics. Japan has been successful at this the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) says thereby limiting waste but the country still incinerates more than it recycles.

Europe Still Needs To Do More

For the OECD after taking into account losses during recycling only nine percent of plastic waste was ultimately recycled globally.

Europe saw little more than a third of plastics collected recycled in 2020.

Germany Sweden and Norway had the best performances at around 40 percent while France had only 24 percent the OECD report found.

The European Patent Office says Europe and the United States (US) account for 60 percent of worldwide patents for plastic recycling with Asia trailing far behind.

Chemical Recycling For Better Or Worse?

Chemical recycling breaks down plastic or depolymerises it into monomers which form basic units for polymers. It can also take the process further by returning plastic into naphtha an oil derivative and a precursor for plastic.

""It's as if by adding a solvent to a cake you return to eggs flour and butter"" Madec explained.

""With the basic ingredients you can re-make plastic as virgin plastic from oil.""

The advantage is that it completes a full recycling for all the seemingly endless P molecules.

However the investment costs are heavy and recycling has to be profitable or it will not be carried out.

The process also requires huge amounts of energy while doubts remain about the level of greenhouse gas emissions and toxic by-products according to the Heinrich Boll Foundation a pro-green public policy think tank and other specialists.

Organic Recycling

Back to naphtha is still in the early stages but world leaders in chemistry have numerous projects lined up for the next 10 years with hopes raised that dependence on oil can be reduced.

But first there are also lots of chemical recycling schemes underway trying to answer cleaner-greener demand from environmentalists the food industry and cosmetics world.

France seems to be trying to catch up notably on Germany which with more than 160 recycling companies can boast nearly four times as many as its western neighbour.

Tyre giant Michelin is setting up a pyrolysis recycling plant for polystyrene and British chemicals group INEOS has announced a project at Wingles in northern France.

Exxon Mobil and TotalEnergies are also opening two recycling centres in France. Canada's Loop Industries and Eastman chemicals from the US have plans to open two factories in France to treat PET by 2025.

Organic recycling looks promising and relies on the use of enzymes.

French start-up Carbios has launched an industrial application of enzymes that render plastic waste compostable and on Thursday began building its first factory to organically recycle PET in eastern France claiming a world first.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The permit stipulates among other things that the business must operate as a used car dealership not exceed 10 units for sale at any given time and operate for at least 30 hours per week.

Eaton County Circuit Court Allegations in City of Charlotte vs Chuck's Chariots LLC

In court documents the city alleges the dealership has not been ""actively engaged in the selling of vehicles which are located in the lot"" has not been operating for at least 30 hours per week and over the past several years ""has been closed with the doors locked for days and weeks at a time"".

Eaton County Circuit Court Additional allegations in City of Charlotte vs Chuck's Chariots LLC

Thomas Hitch attorney for the City of Charlotte said one vehicle has been in the lot seemingly untouched for four years.

“I think that they noticed that cars were not being sold but seemingly more vehicles were coming out with property… it became more of just a junk storing area for automobiles that were apparently limited utility. No one was buying them. They weren’t trying to actively sell them"" Hitch said.

The city filed a complaint saying the alleged zoning violation is a ""nuisance"" and not an ""appropriate"" use of the lot.

“It was an eyesore"" Hitch said. ""It's just two blocks from City Hall on one of the main thoroughfares in the city.”

Margaret Cahill Chuck's Chariots in Charlotte

Charles and Jane Doty the owners of Chuck's Chariots filed an answer to these allegations in which they denied any wrongdoing.

The document was later stricken from the court record because neither Charles nor Jane Doty are attorneys and therefore are not authorized under Michigan law to represent their business.

They have since obtained legal counsel.

“If you as an individual go into court and say 'Your Honor I have the right to represent myself' that's perfectly permitted"" Hitch explained. ""But you can't come in and say 'Hey this is my corporation. This is my limited liability company. I'm going to represent that.'""

Their answer to the allegations claimed they were open 30 hours a week prior to the start of the pandemic and now allow customers to make appointments.

They claimed to have sold five vehicles in 2018 three in 2019 four in 2020 and six in 2021 stating ""one cannot force people to purchase cars.""

Eaton County Circuit Court Charles and Jane Doty's response to allegations

The Dotys state in the document ""Due to Mr. Doty's rapidly deteriorating health prior to this summons we had started making arrangements to scrap the vehicles that appeared no longer worth repairing. It is our goal to clear the inventory and possibly close the business.""

Eaton County Circuit Court Charles and Jane Doty's response continued

But Hitch said the city does not want to force the business to close.

“I don't think anyone has any intention to put these people out of business"" Hitch said. ""We just want them to clean up the site and actually use it for what the special use permit was intended.”

Fox 47 News reached out to the Dotys and their attorney but they declined to comment.

The festival brings archery mead and all things Medieval to mid-Michigan.

“This is my first year here other people from our group have come but I’m really enjoying this today"" said Lian Parsell. Parsell came to the Nordic Fire Festival at the Eaton County Fairgrounds to show off her spinning and weaving. Her work using old methods is what you might have seen in the viking age.

“On this one I’m weaving fleece on the grease straight off the sheep"" she said. ""So it makes a really nice pad for camping because it’s waterproof the wool insulates it and it keeps you very warm and comfortable.”

The festival which took a year off due to the pandemic features axe throwing spear throwing archery music and plenty of food.

But twins Anna and Elizabeth Kupla say a big part of the fun are the outfits.

“I really like the jewelry like this piece because it’s different. And the hats of course. Yeah the hats are authentic and they keep you warm!"" they said.

The Nordic Fire Festival isn't over just yet. It runs through Feb. 27 at 4 p.m.

A man in his 70s his daughter and their dog were able to get from the building safely and are unharmed. Those living directly next door were also evacuated safely.

Hashem Kherfan 20 a student who lives opposite was returning home from a night out with three other friends to be met with the sights of fire crews.

He said: ""Three firefighter trucks were blocking the road. The fire relit around 3am and the crews were not able to leave until the whole roof was hosed again.

""I asked a firefighter and he said everyone was okay and taken to hospital for checks.""

Police forensic services and fire officers remained on scene on Sunday as an investigation continued into the cause of the fire.

Group manager Stefan Rider from Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service said the fire started on the first floor of the property before spreading to the roof.

Mr Rider added: ""Some very swift action from the fire crews stopped it spreading to the neighbours. There were no alarms fitted so they got lucky as they happened to be up and about at the time.

""If they were asleep it could have been much more serious.""

The fire service will return to the scene on Monday to carry out further investigations.

Crews from Earlham Sprowston Wroxham and Hethersett attended after an initial call at 1.15am.

A 22-year-old woman who lives directly opposite and did not wish to be named said she could smell smoke in her living room around 1.30am.

""I looked out the blinds and the house was engulfed in flames"" she said.

COMC or Check Out My Cards is an online trading card consignment store. You send them your cards and they load them to their marketplace and ship them when they’re purchased. Although I’ve never sold any of my cards on COMC I’ve purchased several thousand cards over the past few years. In January I posted an article discussing the Topps’ final three releases for 2021. I knew it would take time for those products to make their way to the COMC Marketplace so I retreated to eBay and pretty much haven’t left.



I have a few saved sellers on eBay and one is 2bros788. This seller’s online store features thousands of singles of newer releases starting at $.99. With a reasonable flat rate of $2.00 shipping I have purchased cards from this seller a few times. The cards I have purchased have been in good condition and well-packaged. So far this year I’ve made two purchases from this seller: The entire 2021 Bowman Draft Chrome and 2021 Bowman’s Best team sets.

I’ve been surprised at some of the prices I have been seeing for the Bowman Draft Chrome cards of JT Schwartz Dominica Hamel and Calvin Ziegler. Although these are each player’s first baseball card some sellers on eBay appear to have been attempting to take advantage of the high demand for this specific product. Thankfully 2bros788 is one of the most reasonably priced sellers you will find on eBay.

I also pieced together the Bowman Draft paper set. Somehow I ended up purchasing the cards of JT Schwartz Dominic Hamel and Calvin Ziegler twice. I also had another seller throw in two extra copies of the Brett Baty card from an auction I won.





This ended up sending me down a rabbit hole looking for some of the different Bowman and Bowman Chrome parallels and refractors of various Mets top prospects.

I really need to purchase more cards of Vientos. I wasn’t too enthused with the prices I was finding on some of the eBay listings but managed to find good prices on three different offerings from 2020 Bowman including the Bowman Draft Sky Blue parallel numbered 426 of a print run of 499. I purchased one more 2020 Bowman Draft parallel of the power hitting third basemen that is still in the mail. I have about 20 cards altogether dating back to 2019 of Vientos and plan on doubling that in 2022.



Francisco Alvarez





I’ve had a rough time on auctions for Francisco Alvarez having at one point lost five in a row for various 2021 Bowman releases Alvarez was included in. The Mets’ top prospect has been a popular target of buyers on eBay with starting prices on auctions significantly higher than other Mets prospects. Fortunately I was able to get Alvarez’ 2021 Bowman Draft Blue parallel numbered 44 of 150 and a 2021 Bowman Draft Chrome Sky Blue Refractor. Considering that Alvarez made his first appearance in the 2020 Bowman Prospects set I’ve managed to purchase roughly 20 cards of the Mets future catcher. I’m hoping to triple that in 2022. Likely ticketed for Double-A Binghamton to begin Alvarez may well be catching in Syracuse in late August when the Rumble Ponies come to town for a six game series.







Brett Baty





I have developed an unhealthy fascination with cards of the young third basemen. Of all the Mets prospects that I have been buying cards of Brett Baty seems to be the player with the most widely available variety of cards and I have definitely taken advantage of the availability.





And there’s more…

…and more.

It’s safe to say I’ve gone all in on Baty and pushed all my chips to the center of the table. Unsurprisingly I’m still waiting for a few more cards of Baty to be delivered. I have over 50 cards of Baty now and easily blow past the century mark before he walks up the the dugout steps in Citi for the first time unless I manage to slow down.

Yeah that probably won’t happen.

I’ve also spent time searching for different team sets from the early 2000’s and attempting to complete some team sets from 1990’s. One of the largest eBay stores for purchasing team sets is run by a seller named teamsets4u. This seller has a massive inventory but also has some of the highest prices. Before purchasing from this seller I try to do my research to see if I can find the cards elsewhere at better prices. On top of having some of the highest prices on eBay this seller charges $4.00 shipping plus an extra $.50 for each additional item. After doing some digging teamsets4u was the only seller on eBay selling 2002 Upper Deck MVP so I pulled the trigger.

I was also able to obtain several reasonably priced team sets from the early 2000’s such as 2001 Donruss three different 2001 Fleer releases (E-X Focus and Showcase) 2003 Donruss Elite and 2004 Fleer Ultra. Moving further along in the decade I finally purchased the 2009 Topps team set minus the cards from the Update & Highlights set. The 2009 Topps team set has eluded me for several years for no other reason than I have been unable to find the set at a reasonable price. There’s nothing special about the team set from 2009. Although it does include a Daniel Murphy rookie card that should not cause the cost of this set to be as high as it has been listed at. I guess the best way to describe it is that I finally surrendered when I purchase the set.

The most rewarding purchases I’ve made were a few random cards I purchased from the largest eBay trading card store on the market burbanksportscards. Burbank Sports Cards is an actual brick and mortar card store located in Burbank California that has millions of singles for all sports available in their eBay store starting at $.99. Last month I was able to complete the Mets team sets for 1993 Classic Best (minors) the 1995 Score Gold Rush parallel set 1996 Emotion X-L 1996 Fleer Update 1996 Topps Chrome and 1998 Bowman Chrome.



Being able to complete a team set by purchasing the cards individually is not always the easiest thing to do but in some instances it may be the only option.

He thought it would be cool to own a replica Game Award something he could put on the shelf Gamer Tat all streamers are required to have behind them in videos by law. So he looked on a few sites including eBay and was surprised to find not a replica but an actual Game Award award listed for $500.

The seller's other listings included car parts and key fobs so Ryan was admittedly a little suspicious. They said the award ""Came from one of our liquidation sources other than that we don't have any other information on the origin of this item."" Ryan ended up taking a gamble paying $375 plus shipping. When the award arrived it turned out to be legit: it was the 2018 Award for Best Independent Game won by Celeste.

Ryan got in touch with Celeste's developers via operations manager Heidy Motta to ask ""did the trophy itself get given away or lost?"" and that's how he found out the developers never received it. Presumably after it was handed over on stage by Ninja during the ceremony it was taken back to be mailed to them and then somehow went missing? It's a mystery.

Finally four years later Celeste's developers Extremely OK Games are getting their award. Ryan offered to mail the trophy to them and the developers generously said they'll reimburse him for the cost as well as send him some signed copies of Celeste. Guess he'll have something to put on his shelf after all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjZ2FtZXNuLmNvbS9jZWxlc3RlL2dhbWUtYXdhcmRzLXRyb3BoeS1mb3VuZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,YouTuber finds Celeste's lost Game Awards trophy on eBay returns it,"It’s already one of the best platform games on PC but 2018’s Celeste also won the trophy for the Best Independent Game at The Game Awards that year. This month however YouTuber PrestigeIsKey discovered that trophy when shopping for a replica on eBay – which apparently the developer never received.

It wasn’t just one of our favourite games of 2018 platformer Celeste is also an excellent example of LGBT+ characters done right. It won the best indie game trophy at the TGAs for 2018 over the likes of Into The Breach Return of the Obra Dinn and The Messenger – but the team never received the trophy again afterward.

Events took a funny turn this month when YouTuber and streamer PrestigeIsKey went looking for a replica Game Award on eBay and discovered a “Game Awards Game Trophy” for $500. The seller says it “came from one of our liquidation sources” but otherwise didn’t know where it came from. Upon unboxing it PrestigeIsKey discovered it was clearly marked as the award for Celeste.

The YouTuber got in touch with Celeste developer Extremely OK Games who confirmed that they never received the award. Presumably it was supposed to be sent to them after the event but never was. This story has a happy ending fortunately: PrestigeIsKey is sending it back to the developer which says they will reimburse him for his costs and will send him some signed copies of Celeste to boot. You can check out the whole saga in the video below.

Furthermore here is the video of the Celeste team receiving the award in the first place after which it was mislaid for four years. Yes that’s Ninja hosting with Pepe the Prawn.

Hopefully all of the winners of the Game Awards 2021 got their trophies safe and sound.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpemNoaW5hLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAyLzI2L3RoZS13b3JsZHMtZmlyc3QtaXBob25lLTEyLXByby1tYXgtd2l0aC11c2ItYy1pcy1saXN0ZWQtb24tZWJheS_SAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5naXpjaGluYS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8yNi90aGUtd29ybGRzLWZpcnN0LWlwaG9uZS0xMi1wcm8tbWF4LXdpdGgtdXNiLWMtaXMtbGlzdGVkLW9uLWViYXkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The world’s first iPhone 12 Pro Max with USB-C is listed on eBay,"Apple has never decided to implement the USB-C port in its iPhone smartphones although it has already been done in iPads. Now we find out that someone will become the happy owner of the iPhone 12 Pro Max with such a port. It was put up for auction on eBay and we can guess that the final price will not be low.

iPhone 12 Pro Max with USB-C is the work of DEPP from Slovakia. Its engineers replaced the Lightning connector with a new one. Importantly working in this way you can both charge the battery and transfer data. The device is operational. The auction will end on Thursday and the final price is likely to be high.

At this time the price was only $ 1350. In the fall of last year however a similar iPhone X with USB-C was at the auction the auction amount of which ended with as much as $ 86 thousand. We can guess that the 12 Pro Max model will be sold for even more.

The world’s first iPhone 12 Pro Max with USB-C is listed on eBay

Many iPhone owners have long been waiting for Apple to deploy the more widespread and acclaimed USB Type-C port on their iPhones as it did on the iPad Pro or MacBooks. Especially users of “PRO” devices would welcome one cable for all the devices they use daily in their work. We have decided to fulfill this desire at least in part and we offer original Apple iPhone mobile phone with a USB-C port instead of the original Lightning port. Gizchina News of the week Join GizChina on Telegram

If you liked the USB-C iPhone X project from Kenny Pi and you wished you had one too so there is one home-made gem. Apple is quite conservative about adding components used by competitors although it did on iPad Pro and Macbooks. And why NO on iPhones? No one knows the answer but it will probably be around Apple MFi certification. So the only way is to customize your own iPhone. It sounds really simple but after watching the mentioned Kenny Pi’s video it’s actually like a patient’s brain surgery. One bad move and no iphone and no joy. We decided to sacrifice one of our iphones and test our skill and endurance. We have implemented original MFi certified chip from Apple and replaced the original Lightning to a high quality USB-C port. From the outside what seems like a simple connector replacement is in fact a procedure comparable to a small operation that requires adequate skills in microelectronics knowledge of electronic circuits and their wiring and a great deal of patience.

Auction house Sotheby’s in partnership with the Ministry of Culture’s Visual Arts Commission hosted the event alongside the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale in Riyadh between Feb. 25-27.

While the biennale brings together Saudi and international artists in a celebration of contemporary culture the digital art forum brought together a slightly different audience.

Through a series of panel events and workshops with leaders in the NFT sphere amateur and digital-native visitors were able to access real-time updates on what was happening in the world of NFTs understand digital wallet security and fully participate in the Metaverse.

HIGHQ LIGHT A NFT is a digital asset that represents real-world objects like art. It cannot be replicated and there is proof on the blockchain that it is one-of-a-kind. Anyone in the world can look at it for reference and it protects artists and their work that is minted as a NFT.

The offline space at the forum hosted 10 prominent NFTs. Charting the history of NFTs from their inception seven years ago until now the dedicated program was aimed at bringing together artists collectors and curators.

“Digital art provides emerging and established art practitioners and collectors with new ways to experience collect and create with art peers around the world” said commission CEO Dina Amin.“As the Kingdom’s visual arts sector continues to rapidly flourish we’re excited to partner with leading global experts such as Sotheby’s to bring this unique opportunity to engage with NFTs and digital art in Riyadh.”

Saudi artist Ahaad Al-Amoudi whose 10-second video NFT “The Mirage” features a split-screen of a dog running and a man riding a horse with audio of an Arab man speaking in English on a loop.

He said: “The dogs the more they love you the harder they will run for you on the day of the race. It’s about relationships—it’s not all about training.”

Visitors were encouraged to scan the QR code accompanying each piece and even purchase them by using an app like OpenSea which calls itself “the world’s first and largest NFT marketplace.”

There has been a buzz around NFTs since Saudi Arabia was on lockdown during the early days of the pandemic in 2020 but it was mostly reserved for “crypto bros” and people who appeared to have too much free time online. In 2022 the metaverse became a reality potentially worth getting into.

With Saudi Arabia being so connected and smartphone usage being so widespread Sebastian Fahey managing director of Sotheby’s Europe the Middle East and Africa said it made sense to host the first NFT forum of its kind in the Kingdom.

“We thought it was a perfect marriage of the local community plus also the digitally native community that is building (being built)” he told Arab News. “And as could be seen by the questions coming through the panel today there is already a very established digital art appreciating and collecting community in Riyadh and in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is a very connected country so it makes sense to be here.

“What we’re seeing from our perspective as an auction house Sotheby’s itself is a 278-year-old auction house and throughout its history we’ve been using our DNA of curating the best of a certain genre. And this movement this medium of digital art NFTs has been having a meteoric rise over particularly the last year and a half or so.”

The exhibition was world-class and had what he called “some of the most important and historically significant artists in the NFT space going all the way back to the very first NFT minted which is the seminal work called Quantum by Kevin McCoy that was minted on May 3 2014.”

Edward Gibbs chairman of Sotheby’s Middle East and India said that the educational focus on NFTs was a “natural next step” in the auction house’s history of supporting innovative cultural programs and was a testament to its longstanding commitment to Saudi Arabia.

“We are delighted to be hosting this first of its kind project at the Diriyah Biennale as a partner of the Visual Arts Commission and Sotheby’s” said Aya Al-Bakree CEO at the Diriyah Biennale Foundation. “The biennale is a hub of arts engagement and learning which inspires creative dialogue across cultures while developing the local ecosystem.”

The biennale runs until March 11 and showcases some of the world’s leading artists.",,,,,,,,,

Events occurred between February 13 2021 and October 22 2021 with a majority occurring without underlying chronic U/AE. However most cases had onset after 4 hours and were mild which investigators noted should not contraindicate future COVID-19 vaccine doses.

The study will be presented at the American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology Annual Meeting (AAAAI) 2022.

In an interview with HCPLive Sara Anvari MD MSc Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital spoke of the registry that was developed by Dr. Kimberly Blumenthal and the immediacy of U/AE reactions following vaccination.

“What was really surprising was to see the amount of reports in this registry with regards to urticaria and angioedema and we saw that the majority of the cases occurred at 24 hours or beyond” Anvari said. “We saw close to 50% of the cases that were in the registry during the initial evaluation that happened during that timeframe and then we saw up to about 35% occurring within the first 4 hours. What was interesting was the resolution took relatively more than 24 hours for more than about 50% of these individuals who reported these cases.”

Of the 455 cases studied the amount of events for both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine were equal and no reported cases were observed for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

Anvari and colleagues noted that 40% of patients in the cohort had an allergic disorder which included nasal allergies asthma and eczema. The team believed these factors potentially predisposed patients to U/AE events following vaccination.

Interestingly this and other studies have shown that female patients make up a majority of reported reactions.

“What we do see that these are resolving issues some of them self-resolving and to the extent that having a urticaria angioedema event can be treated appropriately with long acting antihistamines” Anvari said. “So keeping that in mind this could help alleviate the symptom and one shouldn't worry about the potential of having this go on into anaphylaxis.”

A majority of U/AE events occurred at home with approximately 25% of individuals visiting the emergency room more out of concern rather than necessity.

“For those who did require treatment we can see that a majority of the individuals up to 70% of them had been treated with some form of anti-histamine followed by oral steroids” Anvari said. “So these are kind of an indication to us that the severity is not that significant. Most individuals would find themselves having resolution of this in a relatively short time and this would not be a contraindication to receiving the second (COVID-19 vaccine) dose.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9idWNjYW5lZXJzLXF1YXJ0ZXJiYWNrLXJ5YW4tZ3JpZmZpbi1tYXJyaWVzLTEzMzEyMTIwMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Buccaneers Quarterback Ryan Griffin Marries Marissa Boyd: 'On Cloud Nine!',"NFL star Ryan Griffin is a married man!

While much of the eastern half of Arkansas suffers from population loss and economic decline Jonesboro prospers. Between the 2010 and 2020 census Jonesboro's population increased 16.8 percent from 67263 to 78576 making it the fifth-largest city in the state.

Many Arkansans are aware of what's happening at Jonesboro but it's safe to say that most don't realize that the boom extends to Paragould. In fact I've begun referring to that area as the Jonesboro-Paragould corridor in recognition of the fact that the two cities have grown into one urban area.

Paragould's population increased 13.1 percent between 2010 and 2020 (26113 to 29537). Folks in central and northwest Arkansas don't realize that Paragould is now larger than Russellville West Memphis and Searcy. As recently as the 1970 census Paragould had 10639 residents. That grew to 15248 in 1980; 18540 in 1990; and 22017 in 2000.

There's no end in sight to the growth. I spoke last fall at the annual banquet of the Paragould Chamber of Commerce. Hundreds of people turned out despite the pandemic. It's easy to determine at events such as this when there's momentum in a town. Paragould not only has momentum it has business and civic leaders whose goals align.

First National Bank's Bill Brewer was awarded the chamber's lifetime achievement award. Brewer a graduate of Paragould High School and Arkansas State University personifies the type of business leaders who have propelled Paragould forward. He succeeded his father as board chairman at FNB. His son now serves as vice chairman of a bank that has served Paragould since 1889.

Earlier in 2021 FNB announced that it was expanding into the Nashville Tenn. market by acquiring Citizens Bank of Hartsville Tenn. The Paragould bank now has 24 locations in Arkansas and Tennessee. The expansion started in 1984 when the bank made its way to Corning. The first Jonesboro branch opened in 1998. Rogers and Heber Springs followed in 2014. The next year FNB's northwest Arkansas presence increased with locations at Bentonville Springdale Fayetteville and Johnson.

A move into the Little Rock market occurred in 2018. The previous fall ASU announced that the Convocation Center would now be known as First National Bank Arena. So yes the basketball arena in Jonesboro is named for a Paragould-based bank another symbol of Paragould's increasing importance to the regional economy.

Brewer recently told Arkansas Money & Politics: ""Good things are happening in Paragould. I think we're going to see a lot of things coming faster. ... I don't think central Arkansas and northwest Arkansas necessarily snubbed their noses at northeast Arkansas but I don't think they thought of us as newsworthy. I sure think we are now.""

Paragould once was viewed as a blue-collar manufacturing town. The city attracted the Ely-Walker shirt factory in 1937 the Ed White shoe factory in 1947 Wonder State Manufacturing in 1950 Foremost Foods' dairy division in 1952 and Emerson Electric Co. in 1955. Though the manufacturing base remains strong the Paragould economy is far more diversified than it was 20 years ago. Bankers and lawyers in nice suits can now be spotted in upscale downtown restaurants such as Chow At One Eighteen.

This city atop Crowley's Ridge got its name when the names of two railroad magnates James Paramore and Jay Gould were combined. Railroads controlled by the two men crossed in Greene County six miles south of the county seat of Gainesville. A community grew around the crossing. Postmaster Marcus Meriweather began calling it Paragould.

""Merchants first located on Front Street behind the present buildings facing west on Pruett Street"" Mack Hamblen writes for the Central Arkansas Library System's Encyclopedia of Arkansas. ""First to open were a tent saloon a fish business a tent hotel a bakery a blacksmith shop and a fruit stand. A hardware store and general store opened on Main at the Pruett Street intersection. Soon the area had more merchants than Gainesville.

""Within a year Pruett Street became the main business location in town. In spite of the street's slimy mire several Gainesville businessmen opened stores there. When the county clerk moved his newspaper the Press to Paragould in 1884 it marked the beginning of Gainesville's demise. After a countywide vote in September 1884 Paragould became the county seat though it had no city government.""

The Paragould City Council first met in May 1885. The Greene County Courthouse was completed in 1888 and Paragould City Hall opened two years later.

""Having noted that fire swept rapidly through wooden buildings in downtown Gainesville in 1890 the Paragould City Council passed an ordinance requiring that new buildings in the main part of town be constructed of brick"" Hamblen writes. ""An electric light plant went into operation in 1891 telephone service appeared in 1896 and a municipally owned waterworks opened in 1898. By 1896 Paragould had six miles of gravel streets. It was 1912 before downtown streets were paved.""

As the virgin hardwood timber was cleared in surrounding counties Paragould had 14 lumber mills by 1890 and a population of 1666 people. Once the forests were gone land was drained and row-crop agriculture took over on Delta land on either side of Crowley's Ridge. Efforts to attract industry began after World War II. Now Paragould enters a new era as part of the urbanized Jonesboro-Paragould corridor.

You Can Create a Credit Report Without Taking on Debt -- Here's How,"Approximately 26 millions Americans are considered ""credit invisible"" -- which means they have no credit history according to Experian TransUnion or Equifax America's three major credit bureaus. Of this number Black and Hispanic Americans are more likely to have no credit history than whites and Asian Americans.

Not having a credit history can present major difficulties if you're hoping to obtain loans from banks and other lenders or trying to achieve basic measures of livelihood such as renting an apartment purchasing a car or even getting a job. Historically credit reports can only be established through traditional methods -- repaying loans or using a credit card for example. However due to the cyclical nature of the American credit system if you lack a credit report it can be difficult to secure a loan or credit card in the first place.

The newly launched Experian Go service could help ""credit invisibles"" jump-start their credit by creating a free Experian credit report. Then you can increase your score by reporting on-time bill payments through Experian Boost or through traditional methods including using a credit card to establish on-time payment history.

Experian Go may be helpful to anyone struggling to establish credit but it's not the only way to put yourself on the financial map. Here's everything you need to know about Experian Go -- how it works who it's best for and what to consider before signing up.

What is Experian Go and how does it work?

Experian Go allows Americans without credit to create an Experian credit report almost instantaneously. Experian first rolled out this service in October 2021 to roughly 15000 people. It reports that on average 91% of users who linked everyday cash flow accounts to newly created credit reports went from no FICO score to 665 a measure of fair to good credit.

Experian Go's free membership also provides access to financial education and recommendations as well as a marketplace of financial products and offers. The company plans to pitch Go users credit cards -- its current partners are Petal and Capital One -- including cards intended for consumers with limited credit histories.

Jeff Softley president of Direct to Consumer at Experian Consumer Services explained how Experian Go allows consumers to create a credit profile and receive a credit score ""without taking on debt."" He went on: ""It's a big innovation because it's a stepping stone allowing consumers to gain a financial identity and enter the financial ecosystem on their terms.""

Once your Experian credit report is created through Experian Go you can start to build your credit and expect to see your FICO Score after about six months. If you don't want a credit card right away you can enroll in Experian Boost which links non-debt accounts such as phone utility and streaming bills to your Experian credit report. Just remember paying on time is key otherwise your credit could dip.

Ted Rossman a senior industry analyst at Bankrate (which is also owned by Red Ventures) sees Experian Go as a net positive. ""Our credit score is one of the most important numbers in our financial lives"" he explained. ""And Experian Go -- as a free secure beneficial program that enables credit building -- is ideal. It's also financially low-risk as Experian Go can't hurt your credit score.""

Who is Experian Go best for?

If you do not currently have a credit score or credit history Experian Go can help you get established. This option is best for anyone without credit who is struggling to get approved for a credit card loan or other credit-based account. Experian Go may also help if you need to establish credit history to get approved for an apartment or job but do not want to take on the risk of a credit card.

Drawbacks to consider

Although Experian Go is free and can help you get started on your credit-building journey there are some factors you should consider before signing up.

1. Experian Go only directly impacts your Experian credit report Experian Go only creates an Experian credit report. This means in order for lenders to see your newly established credit they'll need to pull data from Experian and not one of the other two bureaus. In addition it will also only work with the new credit scoring algorithm FICO Score 8. This means Experian Go will not directly help you get a mortgage as lenders will generally request all three of your credit reports and are also mandated to use older versions of FICO. Although Experian Go only benefits your Experian credit score Rossman notes that it can be used to establish credit at other bureaus. For example if you apply for a credit card that only pulls Experian data and you're approved this card will then show up on all three credit reports and that will allow you to begin building credit across all three credit bureaus. Most credit card providers only pull from one credit bureau -- however they don't advertise which one they use up front. So while this approach can help you get approved for a credit card it's a bit of a gamble. If the card provider uses Transunion or Equifax you could be denied right away since you won't have a credit report with either bureau. That said even without Experian Go you could apply for the Chime Credit Builder Secured Visa® Credit Card which doesn't require a credit check or the Petal® 1 ""No Annual Fee"" Visa® Credit Card which may combine your credit report with your banking spending and savings data to compile a Cash Score. You can also apply for a secured credit card -- a card that requires a security deposit as your credit line -- that does not require a credit check. All of these options can help you get established with all three credit bureaus.

2. Cybersecurity breaches may be a concern In an age where data sharing is a major concern and previous credit bureau cybersecurity breaches have resulted in widespread identity theft Experian Go will require you to provide access to personal and private data. However Rossman notes that ""regarding privacy concerns credit bureaus already possess a lot of the data Experian Go would potentially collect.""

3. Experian Go collects and sells your data Heightened data collection is often used by credit-monitoring companies such as Experian Go and Experian Boost to upsell customers products and services that may not be in their best financial interest-- and could even land them in debt. Rossman advises taking Experian Go's suggested products with a grain of salt and to be wary of marketing and cross-selling. That being said he adds ""I feel good about the partners they currently have. Capital One has a great reputation and Petal is also known as a good way for young people to gain credit.""

How to sign up

To enroll you'll need to download the free Experian mobile app and confirm your identity by submitting personal information such as your legal name address date of birth and the last four digits of your Social Security number. You will also have to upload some form of identity verification such as a driver's license or passport and take a selfie. Softley says the entire process takes an average of four minutes. Upon completion you'll have created your first credit report.

Can I build my credit score without Experian Go?

Yes. Although Experian Go can help you quickly create and build your Experian credit score you don't need this tool to establish credit. These traditional options will allow you to build your credit across all three credit bureaus.",,,,,,,,,,,,

She was 92.

The cause of death could not be immediately learned.

More from WWD

The first vice chairman of the company Wagner was instrumental in spearheading Lauder’s international expansion as president and chief executive officer of the International Division.

She was named to that role in 1986 and transformed the division from the smallest and least profitable to the largest and most profitable a position it continues to hold today.

Prior to joining Lauder in 1975 Wagner was editor in chief of all international editions and director of new ventures at The Hearst Corp. She was the first female senior editor of The Saturday Evening Post and editor of The Chicago Daily News.

At Lauder she started as vice president director of marketing for the Estée Lauder brand in the international division and was named corporate senior vice president in 1982 reporting directly to Leonard A. Lauder then the chairman and CEO.

Four years later she assumed oversight of the International Division where she spearheaded strategy for 11 brands in 100 countries. During her tenure new concepts were developed including the first free-standing stores for both the Lauder and Clinique brands as well as flagship environments in five cities in China and in every major Asia Pacific country.

She was named vice chairman in 1998 where she directed new business developments including management oversight for acquisitions like MAC Aveda and Bobbi Brown and represented the company in key global associations.

“Jeanette Wagner was not only one of our all-time best hires she was also one of my all-time favorites” said Lauder who recalled how he came to hire the executive.

“I remember being in a marketing meeting in Paris to plan the international launch of an important Estée Lauder product. The senior vice president of marketing at the time said ‘And now So-and-So will give you his opinion.’ A wave of horror broke over me as I realized there were no women at the table to share their opinions. I realized we needed to change that immediately” he said.

Lauder returned to New York and asked Carol Phillips who was running Clinique and June Leaman the head of creative services. ‘Who is the smartest woman you know?’

“Each one said ‘Jeanette Wagner’ who at the time was running Cosmopolitan’s international publications” Lauder said. “The fact that they both came up with the exact same name spoke volumes!”

Lauder called her impact on the company “incredible.”

“Her international perspective was truly impressive” he said. “Literally everyone who has ever worked with her or for her came away in awe. She was smart she was dedicated and she was a fantastic leader. I am so grateful for her friendship. I will miss her.”

“Jeanette led the way for so many great women in our company and in our industry” said Jane Judis executive group president of the Estée Lauder Cos. “ A brilliant mind one of a kind.”

“Jeanette was a groundbreaking global business leader” said Sally Susman who was the chief communication officer at the company from 2000-2008 before moving to Pfizer where today she is executive vice president chief corporate affairs officer. “Her passion was opening new markets for the Estée Lauder Companies. I traveled with her to China and saw the respect in which she was held by employees retailers government officials and thought leaders there. When I travel I channel Jeanette with her curiosity and intrepid spirit. ‘Jet lag is boring’ she said.”

After retiring in 2002 Wagner turned her considerable energies to improving public school education in New York City serving as secretary of the Board of the Fund for Public Schools during Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s term in office. She served on a number of boards including the New York City Center and the Department of Cultural Affairs the Library of America Advisory Board and the Harvard Business School Club Board Emerita.

Wagner who was a champion of women in the workplace throughout her career also received numerous awards including the Harvard Business School Alumni Achievement Award in 1999 a CEW Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002 and the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 2016.

She is survived by a step-daughter Paula Wagner; cousin Zabelle Vartanian; niece Nicole Vartanian and nephew Garen Vartanian.

The Ford Motor Company will unveil the T6.2-based model at 18:00 AEDT via livestream. In addition to the three-row the launch will bring together chief platform engineer Ian Foston and design head Max Wolff.Spied in Australia Europe and the United States with minimal camouflage and coil-sprung rear suspension  the family-oriented utility vehicle is dubbed Endeavor in the Indian market. So far the Ford Motor Company has confirmed production in Thailand where FoMoCo will invest $900 million to support the production of the SUV and its Ranger-badged sibling.Just like the second-generation Everest we’re looking forward to various diesel engines for the Australian market whereas China is likely to receive a four-cylinder turbo. The 2.0-liter EcoBlue and 2.3-liter EcoBoost seem to be the culprits together with the 10R ten-speed automatic transmission.As far as the all-new Ranger is concerned the Dearborn-based automaker has confirmed a 3.0-liter turbo diesel V6 engine in addition to the single- and bi-turbo EcoBlue mentioned in the previous paragraph. The Ranger Raptor was recently confirmed with the 3.0-liter EcoBoost and the bi-turbo EcoBlue but still don’t hold your breath for the Raptor-infused Everest.Imagined with the Raptor’s exterior design cues by pixel artist Joao Kleber Amaral the dune-bashing utility vehicle would cannibalize with its pickup sibling. Even though body-on-frame utility vehicle sales are on the rise in the Asia-Pacific reason the Everest still is a small fish in a pond that also includes heavyweights like the Toyota Fortuner and Land Cruiser Prado.Unfortunately for North America the Ford Motor Company has no plans of bringing the Everest stateside as the three-row alternative to the Bronco.

BLAIRSTOWN NJ- Mr. Matt Scarfo will soon climb on Mount Everest to raise funds to research a very rare – and always-fatal – children’s disease.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs only once in every 3500 live births. These kids (mostly boys) are in wheelchairs by their early teens.

Scarfo said breathing on ventilators by their mid-late-teens. And in graves by their early twenties. After suffocating.

“I had heard about the work being done by JAR of Hope foundation (Asbury Park NJ) in raising funds to research a cure for Duchenne” Scarfo says.

And I began communicating with Jim Raffone CEO/Founder of JAR of Hope.

Jim has a twelve-year-old son with Duchenne. And two of my kids are close to his age…so learning about this disease hit me like a hammer.”

In April Matt Scarfo will join Jim Raffone and Dillon Doeden a Nebraska resident whose four-year-old son has Duchenne to climb Mount Everest.

“When Jim told me he was going to climb on Everest to raise funds to research a cure” Scarfo says “I wanted to help out. It’s a long time away from family and work. But if that’s what it takes to draw attention to Duchenne…I’m all in.”

The three men can’t be away for the two months it takes to get acclimated at a base camp and then try to summit on the top of Everest. So they’re aiming for the upper Base Camp at 18372’.

They’ll leave on April 25 and return on May 13. .

“Doctors told us ‘There is no cure. Just bring him home and love him until he dies.’ But after the initial shock of hearing that Karen and I decided that waiting for our son to die – waiting for any child to die – was not an option. So we founded JAR of Hope.”

Raffone says the men are hoping to raise $150000 on this climb up Everest to go toward the $750000 cost of clinical trials to start researching a cure at the University of Florida.

“And if we can achieve our goal” he says “it will give some hope to families who now have none. Climbing Mount Everest is obviously an unorthodox way to raise funds. But we can’t hold fund-raising events because of COVID.

And these kids are dying even as we speak.”",,,,,,,,,

Gucci originally announced the metaverse development on its Discord server earlier this month. The Sandbox is a digital platform allowing people brands and organizations to buy and develop virtual real estate.

Gucci’s idea is an “interactive fashion experience” based on Gucci Vault the umbrella term for the brand’s metaverse-related projects along with the line of business Gucci is using to sell vintage pieces from its collection and from other emerging designers.

The idea will be spearheaded by Alessandro Michele Gucci’s creative director. The report noted the project is inspired by “childhood memories of the search for beauty” though not many other details are available thus far.

Per the report the finished product will let fans buy virtual fashion items and it will come with an interactive maze and space to host “conversations about fashion and the metaverse.”

Gucci was an early adopter of things like digital fashion and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) along with the metaverse so the company’s ideas here gel with what they have been doing. Gucci also partnered with Superplastic recently with the intent of making a set of NFTs.

Gucci parent Kering’s online sales were up 55% last year which was a key driver in the company’s overall trend of improvement for its earnings results.

The company had its online penetration rates double since 2019. Now they make up 15% of the company’s overall retail sales.

Kering’s revenue was 40% higher in 2021 than in 2020.

“Kering realized excellent performances in 2021 further consolidating its prominent position in the luxury of the future” Chairman and CEO François-Henri Pinault said at the time. “Thanks to their ability to blend authenticity with bold creativity all our Houses achieved sharp sales rebound way beyond their 2019 levels while reinforcing the exclusivity of their distribution and further enhancing their brand equity.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY290dHNkYWxlLm9yZy9jaXR5X25ld3Mvc2hvcnQtdGVybS1yZW50YWxzLWluY3JlYXNlZC1pbi1zY290dHNkYWxlLWxhc3QteWVhci9hcnRpY2xlX2VhYWI4NDVhLTk2ODgtMTFlYy04ZmE3LTczYzdmZDE5Zjc3OS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Short-term rentals increased in Scottsdale last year,The purple in this map represents homes in Scottsdale that are used as short-term rentals.,,,,,,
EXPD,Expeditors International,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvZm9yZWNhc3RzLWhlcmVzLWFuYWx5c3RzLXRoaW5rLWZ1dHVyZS0xMTQyMTYzNjAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Forecasts: Here's What Analysts Think The Future Holds For Expeditors International of Washington Inc ...,"Shareholders in Expeditors International of Washington Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPD) may be thrilled to learn that the analysts have just delivered a major upgrade to their near-term forecasts. Consensus estimates suggest investors could expect greatly increased statutory revenues and earnings per share with analysts modelling a real improvement in business performance.

Following this upgrade Expeditors International of Washington's ten analysts are forecasting 2022 revenues to be US$17b approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are anticipated to descend 11% to US$7.50 in the same period. Prior to this update the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$15b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$6.60 in 2022. There has definitely been an improvement in perception recently with the analysts substantially increasing both their earnings and revenue estimates.

See our latest analysis for Expeditors International of Washington

As a result it might be a surprise to see that the analysts have cut their price target 8.8% to US$109 which could suggest the forecast improvement in performance is not expected to last. There's another way to think about price targets though and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. Currently the most bullish analyst values Expeditors International of Washington at US$125 per share while the most bearish prices it at US$94.00. This is a very narrow spread of estimates implying either that Expeditors International of Washington is an easy company to value or - more likely - the analysts are relying heavily on some key assumptions.

Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Expeditors International of Washington's revenue growth will slow down substantially with revenues to the end of 2022 expected to display 1.8% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 17% over the past five years. By way of comparison the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 4.1% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth it seems obvious that Expeditors International of Washington is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants.

The Bottom Line

The biggest takeaway for us from these new estimates is that analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates with improved earnings power expected for this year. Pleasantly analysts also upgraded their revenue estimates and their forecasts suggest the business is expected to grow slower than the wider market. A lower price target is not intuitively what we would expect from a company whose business prospects are improving - at least judging by these forecasts - but if the underlying fundamentals are strong Expeditors International of Washington could be one for the watch list.

Analysts are definitely bullish on Expeditors International of Washington but no company is perfect. Indeed you should know that there are several potential concerns to be aware of including concerns around earnings quality.

Meanwhile the 30XE is exclusive to T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile.

Both phones launch soon but pricing is a mystery.

Update: February 27 2022 (11 AM ET): TCL has announced the prices for the Verizon-exclusive 30V 5G and T-Mobile-exclusive 30XE 5G. The phones will cost $299 and $199 respectively. Both phones are now available for purchase from their respective carriers. Original article: January 4 2022: TCL is relatively new to making smartphones under its own branding with only two years under its belt. It’s now in the swing of things though and at CES 2022 it launched two new phones for the US market. See also: The best budget phones you can currently buy

The TCL 30V and TCL 30XE are the first phones in the 30 series to hit the US. Both are 5G-capable but you’ll need to be on either Verizon or T-Mobile to get them.

Below you’ll find what you need to know about each device!

TCL 30V: Just for Verizon

TCL

The “V” in the TCL 30V name might stand for Verizon but it might as well. This is a phone exclusive to Big Red in the United States.

Since Verizon’s 5G network is primarily based on mmWave tech it shouldn’t be surprising to hear the 30V supports both Sub-6 and mmWave connections. The relatively weak Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 chipset enables those connections. Required reading: What you should know about mmWave and Sub-6 5G

Under the hood the TCL 30V has 4GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. It has a microSD card slot if you need up to 1TB of extra space. Android 11 powers the phone and it stays alive with a 4500mAh battery. That battery charges at 18W wired but there’s no wireless charging.

On the front you’ll find a 6.67-inch FHD+ (2400 x 1080) display. It has a refresh rate of 60Hz unfortunately and is covered with the quite old Gorilla Glass 3. A centered cutout exposes the selfie camera which is a 16MP shooter capable of capturing video at 1080p/30fps.

On the back you’ll find a triple camera array. The primary shooter is a 50MP wide and it’s flanked with a 5MP ultrawide and a 2MP macro. Next to the camera array you’ll find a trusty capacitive fingerprint scanner.

TCL wouldn’t divulge when you’ll be able to get the 30V nor how much it will cost. All it would cop to is a release date “in the coming weeks” and a price announcement with the same vague promise.

TCL 30XE: For T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile

TCL

If you don’t have Verizon and want a TCL 30 series phone in the US your next best bets will be T-Mobile or Metro by T-Mobile. The two carriers will sell the TCL 30XE.

This is also a 5G device but does not have mmWave support. That will no doubt make it cheaper than the 30V but TCL won’t tell us how much it’s going to cost or when you’ll be able to get it.

On the front the 30XE has a 6.52-inch screen with a low-resolution display (just 1600 x 720). Thankfully that display does have a 90Hz refresh rate which should make it a bit nicer to use. The relatively weak DragonTrail 3 glass covers the screen. See also: The best T-Mobile phones to spend your money on

Inside a MediaTek Dimensity 700 acts as the processor. It’s paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. Once again there’s a microSD card slot if you need extra space but it’s limited to 512GB cards at the max. The 4500mAh battery should last you a long time but TCL wouldn’t divulge how fast it can charge.

On the back the TCL 30XE has a triple-lens camera module. That’s a 13MP wide a 2MP depth sensor and a 2MP macro. In other words this will not be a photography or videography powerhouse. There’s also a capacitive fingerprint scanner back there.

Tucked up against your seatpost it adds an extra 0.8L of narrow waterproof storage to pack tools or small spares when space gets tight. At the same time Restrap figures not everyone wants a low-key setup and Orange is the new Black right.

Restrap mini Rear Top Tube Bag

Restrap’s new little Rear Top Tube Bag isn’t the first we’ve seen to pack a bit more gear against your seatpost – we’ve tried similarly adaptable packs from Revelate EVOC Apidura and others. In fact many strap-on toptube bags can be moved out back for those riders with sloping frame designs that need a bit more storage. The trick generally is adding a useful bit of extra space without getting in the way of your legs when pedaling or when stepping off the bike in front of the saddle.

Tech details & pricing

The Restrap solution is a small 3cm wide x 18cm long x 13cm tall quarter circle with a full-length waterproof zipper along its outside arc and a 65g claimed weight including the two adjustable position velcro straps.

Inside a light plastic liner gives the bag structure stability strapped at just two points (adjustable position to get around your seatclamp) and makes it easy to open one-handed between your legs.

The black-only bag features an orange nylon lining to make it easy to find small items inside and is handmade in Yorkshire UK. The 100% waterproof Rear Top Tube Bag is available now for £35 / $53 / 42€.

Restrap tweaked Canister Bag

Another small update in addition to the revamped 2-size Bar Bag v3 Restrap also upgraded their Canister Bag with the same internal plastic stiffening structure as the new Rear Top Tube Bag. They also add an extra elastic bungee retention strap that lets you secure the bag around your headtube to keep it from bouncing around while riding. Plus the updated £45 / $68 / 54€ Canister now comes in bright orange & olive green in addition to standard black.

Orange is the new Black

Not only the Canister in orange Restrap says their Orange Tyre Boot Kit is more easily found inside the deep dark depths of your overstuffed pack when you need to repair a damaged tire on the side of the road or trail in the waning daylight. Plus once the tire is booted the orange patch will always make it easier to find the repair inside a black tire or to keep an eye on a big cut from the outside through the tread.

Pick up a £9 / $14 / 11€ Tyre Boot Kit to be prepared for your next off-road adventure.

Hawaii Circuit Court Judge Jeffrey Crabtree ruled in favor of the city amid an attempt by Chevron Sunoco ExxonMobil and other defendants to dismiss the lawsuit. The move is a key step in allowing the case to proceed to trial.

“This is an unprecedented case for any court let alone a state court trial judge” Crabtree wrote in his ruling.

Cory Lum/Civil Beat/2018

The Honolulu Board of Water Supply filed the state court case in 2020 with the help of Sher Edling a national firm that is pursuing similar cases across the country.

The plaintiffs argue that the fossil fuel industry engaged in a decades-long campaign of deception to discredit climate science and sow doubt in the mind of the public that fossil fuel production was harming the planet. And now the lawsuit complaint says the public is paying the price.

Because of climate change Oahu will experience rising sea levels flooding erosion beach loss and extreme weather as well as decreasing fish populations the death of coral reefs habitat losses and other dire impacts the lawsuit states.

The plaintiffs are using state tort law against the oil companies arguing that the defendants had a duty to disclose information they knew and that they breached that duty.

The fossil fuel companies countered that the plaintiffs were trying to regulate global fossil fuel emissions and that the case is a federal legal matter but Crabtree rejected that argument among others.

Cory Lum/Civil Beat/2018

“As this court understands it Plaintiffs do not ask for damages for all effects of climate change; rather they seek damages primarily for the effects of climate change allegedly caused by Defendants’ breach of long-recognized duties” Crabtree wrote.

This debate about state and federal jurisdiction is playing out in similar climate change cases across the country but Crabtree is the first judge in the nation to have issued a ruling rejecting the fossil fuel companies’ argument said Denise Antolini a local attorney who specializes in environmental law.

“He based his ruling on very traditional tort law theory and practice and so as he says while the claims may be unusual and unprecedented the law they’re based on is not” said Antolini who has submitted legal filings in support of the city and county’s case.

In a statement Honolulu’s chief climate change officer Matthew Gonser said he appreciated Crabtree’s ruling.

“The Court recognized that Honolulu’s case is grounded in well-established state law tort claims such as failures to disclose and deceptive promotions and that it is important for cities such as Honolulu to be able to seek redress for their injuries” said Gonser who heads Honolulu’s Office of Climate Change Sustainability and Resiliency.

“On behalf of Honolulu’s taxpayers we look forward to the opportunity to present our evidence at trial. We are confident in the strength of our case.”

The oil companies are represented by some of Honolulu’s most prominent attorneys including Paul Alston for Exxon Mobil Joachim Paul Cox for Shell Oil and former attorney general Margery Bronster for BHP GROUP.

Those lawyers did not respond to a request for comment.

The County of Maui filed its own climate change case with Sher Edling which has been consolidated with Honolulu’s case.

While the counties’ case proceeds in state court they are simultaneously fighting the oil companies in federal court as well.

U.S. District Court Judge Watson remanded the matter from federal court to state court last year but the oil companies are appealing that ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. While the parties await a ruling on that appeal Watson ruled that the state cases can proceed.

If the 9th Circuit determines it should be a federal case the state rulings would be moot and the process would have to start over from the beginning at the federal level Antolini said.

Today’s column continues with a presentation of Envision Research’s modelling of ExxonMobil’s seeming turnaround away from the process of zombification as I have explained this term. The model under consideration is based on the thesis that as a long -term Global 500 Corporation ExxonMobil’s organic growth rate is a function of two variables; namely the return on its capital employed ROCE and the Reinvestment Rate RR which is ploughed back into the business. Note: Long-term Growth Rate = ROCE x RR.

The ROCE was examined in last week’ column and the RR is depicted in the next Section.

ExxonMobil’s Reinvestment Rate

ExxonMobil’s use of cash between Q1 2019 and Q3 2021 as a percentage of its cash from operations [CFO] is revealed in a Chart constructed by Envision Research which is reproduced below. Like its counterpart shown last week [capital employed] the financial data are calculated from quarterly trailing twelve-month [TTM] financials. The data reveal that the company’s organic investment rate has been almost 0% since Q1 2019. Clearly since then the company has been unable to generate enough operating income to cover its CAPEX and its dividends.

Envision Research has urged that “as profitability recovers …it finally begins to regain some flexibility in capital allocation starting in Q3 of 2021. In the third quarter of 2021 its dividend payment is about 42% of CFO. Therefore as a result these two mandatory expenses cost a combined 75% of the CFO. And ExxonMobil can deploy the remainder 25% to fuel organic growth”.

Alternatively ExxonMobil’s long-term average dividend payment ratio [about 40 percent of CFO.] plus its long-term average CAPEX expenses as a percentage of CFO is about 50% of CFO. Consequently Envision Research has advised its customers that as of now ExxonMobil is well placed in regard to its ability to allocate capital.

Envision Research based on Seeking Alpha data

As matters now stand both the determination of ExxonMobil’s ROCE discussed last week and its RR discussed today are established. Envision Research is therefore in a position to give good stock guidance. The firm is in a position to make projections about ExxonMobil’s long-term growth rate and potential returns. These projections are summarized below. Dividends are assumed to grow at the same rates as earnings and dividends are not reinvested. There are two projections made. Namely the bear case representing a pressured ROCE of 10 percent and a reinvestment rate of 10 percent as well. This combination yields a long-term organic growth rate of one percent per annum (10% ROCE x 10% reinvestment rate). The other [normal] case has a ROCE of 15 percent and a RR of 15 percent. This yields an annual organic growth rate of 2.5 percent.

Wrap-up

When the above analysis is applied Envision Research arrives at:

1 Earnings per share [EPS] in three to five years = US$ 5.96 Bear Case and US$6.25 = Normal Case.

2 Dividends = US$ 25.58 [Bear Case] and US$27.54 in Normal Case

3 Total Return = Bear Case =18.2% and Normal Case = 68.4%

The research admits there are risks. I share these for readers below

● The biggest one as I can see is the pace and degree of the post-COVID economy recovery. Although the vaccination is progressing extensively and the economy is re-opening at a pace. However the pandemic is far from over yet and uncertainties like the Delta and Omicron variants still exist.

● XOM’s also faces some interest rate risks especially in regards to recent hawkish Federal Reserve comments. XOM’s current long-term debt is about $45B a quite sizable debt burden especially in absolute terms. A 1% increase in its interest rate would translate into $450M of additional interest expenses. Its TTM operating income is about $13.8B TTM (and $6.34B a year ago). Therefore the additional interest expenses would be about 4% of its current TTM operating income (or 7% of its last year’s operation income) – a non-negligible impact.

Conclusion and final thoughts

XOM stock price has advanced by more than 30% since Sept 2021. Currently it’s at the highest level in about two years. However there are still good reasons to be bullish both in the near term and in the long term. In particular

● In the near term as the oil price stays above XOM’s breakeven price (about $45 per barrel) an $80 target price can be conservatively supported.

● As oil prices stabilize and travel recovers after the pandemic its profitability has turned a corner and demonstrated a perfect V-shaped recovery. The current ROCE is at a very healthy 15.8%. Not only healthy in absolute terms but also higher than its long-term average by 230 basis points.

● Furthermore the improved cash flow also enables excellent capital allocation flexibility. XOM currently can deploy up to 25% of its operating cash flow to fuel organic growth far above its long-term historical average 10% reinvestment rate.

● Projected returns are moving closer to the high end of the consensus estimates leading to a 68% total return in the next three to five years.

Overall the average consensus seems to have underestimated the possibility of oil price hikes as well as the optionality generated by the company’s recent cash generation capability.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyaXNlLnR2L3NlcGxhdC1leHBsYWlucy1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi1vZi1leHhvbm1vYmlsLWFzc2V0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Seplat Explains Acquisition of ExxonMobil Assets,"Seplat Energy has defended its acquisition of oil assets belonging to Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (MPNU) in the face of global resistance to fossil fuels explaining that it would require returns from fossil fuel investments to push its plan for renewable energy.

THISDAY had exclusively reported that the oil company was set to buy off oil and gas assets belonging to the International Oil Company (IOC) in a deal that could cost up to $1.2 billion seen as the first since the signing of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) by President Muhammadu Buhari last year.

In addition the Sale and Purchase Agreement will see the company acquire the entire share capital of MPNU plus up to $300 million contingent consideration encompassing the acquisition of the entire offshore shallow water business of ExxonMobil in Nigeria.

Speaking during a virtual interaction with journalists Chief Executive Officer of Seplat Energy Mr Roger Brown argued that given the pillars upon which the future of the company is hinged it would require returns from fossil fuel investments to push its plan for renewable energy.

He added that Seplat already set up a subsidiary called Seplat Energy offshore limited that would be acquiring the business of MPNU.

He explained that employees of the selling company as well as all the existing contracts will be maintained stating that the intention is to continue to run the assets profitably since according to him they are already well managed.

But the Seplat CEO stated that the deal will still have to go through the statutory processes including the competition commission and the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Agency (NURPC) as well as obtaining the consent of the minister of petroleum.

He noted that Seplat would continue the “excellent performance” of the Mobil business adding that the new entity has a slightly different plan in terms of cost-efficiency.

“We do look for cost efficiencies. Our decision-making time I think it’s faster. Normally as compared to oil majors that’s what independents are there to do.

“And we are looking for operational efficiencies as well as cost reduction where we can touch on operating cost. We’ve been successful in doing that in other existing businesses. And again over the last 10 years we’ve seen a reduction in costs and losses in Seplat.

“If you look at our strategy which we laid in July last year we set it out deliberately on three pillars. We have pillar one which is our upstream oil and gas business and pillar two business is the midstream gas business going down into gas power.

“ We made a decision before to look at the power opportunities and then our new energy the bridge into renewable energy. That strategy has not changed.

“But when we look at that strategy if you look at the world today the world today is going towards lower carbon sort of wealthier countries in the world moving towards net-zero targets” he posited.

Describing gas as a transition fuel Roger explained that the federal government was right when it declared a decade of gas recently.

He explained that the upstream gas will supply the company’s midstream business in terms of oil arguing that prices are likely to go into the much-expected supercycle given the lack of investment and the geopolitical tensions.

“ It’s important to efficiently get it (oil) out of the ground and then sell it and get these dollars to reinvest back into Nigeria to ensure that we’re addressing other businesses.

“So without the oil today you don’t have money to ensure you have a transition. And therefore this transaction what it does do is a big production. Its production will double what Seplat has today. So this short cycle production allows us to monetise it and reinvest in other businesses” he noted.

He expressed confidence that contrary to the belief in certain quarters fossil fuels will not go into extinction shortly adding that stakeholders were beginning to realise that in the long run any attempt to leave fossil fuels behind will lead to higher fuel prices.

Oil Prices Recede After Week’s Peak of $105 Per Barrel

Meanwhile crude oil prices slipped yesterday the last day of transaction for the week after it went on overdrive a day earlier on the back of the Russia-Ukraine face-off.

The crude oil price had surged above $105 per barrel for the first time since 2014 after Russia attacked sites across Ukraine.

The situation signalled the worsening of an already tightening global supply market.

The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) an international group of oil producers was already struggling to meet its production target before the latest threat.

Russia is the world’s third-largest oil producer and second-largest oil exporter and any impact on its production could markedly affect the market.

It is also the largest provider of natural gas to Europe providing over 35 per cent of its supply.

Brent was up about six per cent on the day paring gains after surging as much as 9.2 per cent to $105.79 a barrel after President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops into Ukraine.

The United States benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) also briefly topped $100 a barrel before easing off of gains.

But on the last day of trading the April Brent crude futures contract was down $1.06 or 1.1 per cent at $98.02 per barrel in the afternoon after climbing as high as $101.99 per barrel. The active May contract shed 64 cents or 0.7 per cent to $94.78.

In addition the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) United States crude was down 31 cents or 0.3 per cent to $92.50 a barrel after hitting a session high of $95.64.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had caused prices to surge with the assault seen as the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two.

He is the first deaf person to win an individual SAG Award; his costar Marlee Matlin famously become the first deaf actress to win an Oscar several years before the SAG Awards began in 1995.

In a heartfelt speech delivered in sign language with an interpreter off-screen Kotsur said he’s been a member of the Screen Actors Guild since 2001. “I know you all know what it’s like to be a starving actor. Back then I used to sleep in my car. I slept in my dressing room backstage I couch surfed all that. You feel me right?” He went on to thank the film’s cast director and producers and gave special mention to Apple TV+ for providing options for deaf and hard of hearing viewers including burned-in subtitles. He also thanked the streamer for “believing in deaf actors and casting us authentically as actors who happen to be deaf so hats off to Apple TV+.”

CODA has had the longest journey to awards season of any film in the race premiering at the all-virtual Sundance Film Festival over a year ago and opening with a well-received but quiet theatrical release in the summer. Kotsur quickly emerged as the film’s biggest awards hope nominated for a Golden Globe a Critics Choice Award a BAFTA and a raft of critics awards in addition to the SAG Award. His biggest competition has been Kodi Smit-McPhee** star of the critically lauded Power of the Dog who won the Golden Globe and the majority of critics prizes. Kotsur’s win might then feel like something of a surprise but there’s been a sense in recent weeks among insiders that he and CODA also a best-picture nominee could be surging. The SAG win seems like proof that that’s exactly what’s happening.

Several of these actors will be facing off again soon—Smit-McPhee Kotsur and Jared Leto are all nominated at the Critics Choice Awards which take place March 13. That’s the same day as the BAFTAs where Kotsur and Smit-McPhee are also nominated. And if you haven’t guessed yet they’re also the only ones in this group nominated for Oscars alongside J.K. Simmons Ciarán Hinds and Jesse Plemons. With this many great performances to choose from no wonder so many of them are nominated.

A Saturday statement on the FedEx website reads: “We are closely monitoring the situation and have contingency plans in place including temporarily suspending inbound and outbound services to Ukraine and inbound service to Russia until further notice.”

FedEx didn't say specifically why it was suspending service to Russia. The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.

FedEx competitor UPS also suspended its services to and from Ukraine and international shipments into Russia.

News organizations have reported numerous Russian attacks around Ukrainian airports including Boryspil the main international airport outside the capital Kyiv. According to Google Maps FedEx has a facility near Boryspil.

EU restricts Russian commercial flights; Russia likewise restricts EU Canadian flights

On Sunday the European Union voted to close airspace to Russian airlines to buy weapons for Ukraine and ban pro-Kremlin media outlets The Associated Press reported.

On Monday Russia responded by barring airlines from the EU and Canada from its airspace Reuters reported.

A Russian aviation authority's list of barred countries includes 36 countries and territories most of them European nations such as the United Kingdom and Germany as well as Canada and some overseas territories such as the British Virgin Islands.

The Russian agency's website says carriers from these countries can apply for special permission for flyovers. Still the decision means that for the most part European airliners will have to make big detours around Russian airspace.

The United States is not on Russian agency's list of barred countries and it wasn't immediately clear if Russia's decision would bar a U.S.-based cargo carrier like FedEx from Russian airspace.

Due to the Covid situation last month and international flight being cancelled the vessel was waiting to complete fitments to make it fully operational.“The builder has officially intimated us that the engineers and technicians from Italy cannot come to Goa until April-end due to rising Covid-19 cases.Since the motor itself is from Italy there is a delay in operating the ferry” said captain of ports James Braganza.The electric-cum-solar ferry boat is being built by Aquarius Shipyard at Divar who have imported the electric motors from Italy. In November 2018 a delegation from Goa visited Kerala which was the first to introduce solar-powered passenger vessels in India. From that visit the delegation decided to commission a solar-powered ferry boat on a trial basis in Goa. Officials at the RND said that Goa will become the second in India to use this technology.“This is a special motor that runs only on electric power – a technology that is new to ferry services in Goa. It runs a lot like the electric cars whose batteries need to be charged. Therefore having this motor is a requirement to run a solar hybrid ferry” an official said.To avoid dependency on specialised engineers again RND has decided to store spare parts of the motor as back up. “Instead of an engine running on diesel the motor will run the vessel’s propeller.

A 1.7-megawatt solar photovoltaic plant has been commissioned by Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) at Bina Madhya Pradesh for the Indian Railways.

Overview:

Power to the traction systems of Indian Railways will be fed directly through this plant.

This plant was commissioned after the Indian Railways decided to become self-reliant for their electricity need and planned to solarise railway stations by utilizing the vacant lands it has for various Renewable Energy (RE) projects.

This is the first such Solar Power Plant commissioned on the Indian Railways network to directly feed Traction Power.

The Solar Plant commissioned at Bina covers an area of over ten acres. 5800 solar modules are put on 145 sets of modular mounting structures on 1015 pile foundations at the Solar Plant.

The electricity generated in this plant will be provided to the Indian Railways free of cost.

8 MU of electricity per year is being expected to be generated from this Solar Plant.

2160 Tonnes of Carbon dioxide emission annually will be saved from this Solar Plant.

The Plan of Utilizing Solar Energy to Power the Railway Stations

In the Union Budget 2017-18 it was announced that solar power would be used to power approximately 7000 railway stations across the country in the medium term.

The government declared in the budget that 2000 railway stations would be built as part of its 1000-Megawatt solar project.

The objective of the Indian Railways to become a Net Zero Carbon Emission Rail Network will be accelerated by the usage of solar power. To achieve this the Indian Railways had developed plans to set up 20 GW capacity solar power plants by utilizing its vacant land by 2030.

Following great performances from Dua Lipa and Tyler the Creator the Dan Reynolds-led Imagine Dragons capped off the three-night stint with a massive sold-out show.

Confetti and hit records fell from start to finish through the Las Vegas pop rock band’s huge 24-song set list and loyal fans sang along through the entire show whether it was a big single like “Thunder” and “Natural” or one of the band’s B-side tracks from their 2021 LP “Mercury - Act 1."" If we’re being honest though you didn’t have to be a super fan of Imagine Dragons to sing along to the lion’s share of their set since the “Radioactive” band has been churning out chart-topping tracks for the past 10 years.

We could say so much about the band’s latest world tour but a picture says a thousand words so we’ll let some of our best shots from the evening do the talking.

Check our some of our favorite images from Imagine Dragons’ Milwaukee stop at Fiserv Forum on Friday night.

1. Dan Reynolds is a natural

Dan Reynolds is one of the best frontmen in the business when it comes to live performances. Of course his vocals are great and he’s an award-winning songwriter – but the man was put on this planet to perform music live for sold-out arenas. Imagine Dragons have built up a strong reputation for being great on stage and Reynolds’ stage presence is the reason why. It’s no surprise that the Las Vegas native became a great entertainer.

2. Confetti rains down

Why wait for the encore to shower the crowd with confetti? The Imagine Dragons’ can’t think of a plausible reason why. After a video intro to kick off their set Reynolds emerged at the end of the massive stage’s catwalk and soon after the confetti cannons shot out to get the performance started on a high note. Fans in attendance will be finding random pieces of confetti for weeks to come.

3. MØ leaned on her closer

MØ is a talented singer-songwriter from Denmark who has been building a fan base in the U.S. and abroad since 2014 but the crowd was mostly unfamiliar with the bulk of her set. Although she still put on a great show and was picked to support the tour for a reason the highlight of her set came as MØ performed her Major Lazer and DJ Snake collab “Lean On"" one of the biggest tracks of 2015. Of course the crowd was more than familiar with her hit single as MØ ended her set with a great selection.

4. Jumpman

Dan Reynolds must've been hoping to get himself a 10-day contract with the Bucks showing off his hops throughout the night as he sprinted along the tour’s massive catwalk.

5. Praise to Wayne Sermon

Although Reynolds is the star of the show he is nothing without the band that backs him. And although lead guitarist Wayne Sermon wasn’t one of the founding members he has been with the Imagine Dragons since before the fame and hit records. Reynolds showed his appreciation to his bandmate and longtime friend early on in the performance as he got down on his hands and knees to bow down to the talented musician.

6. A three-night curtain call

While Dua Lipa and Tyler the Creator both brought thousands of fans to Fiserv Forum for their headlining performance Imagine Dragons capped off the three consecutive concerts with the only sold-out show. Each concert was great in its own right but it was fitting that the stint ended with the biggest concert at Fiserv in quite some time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qc29ubGluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9tdXNpYy8yMDIyLzAyLzI2L2ltYWdpbmUtZHJhZ29ucy1oYWQtaW1wb3J0YW50LW1lc3NhZ2UtbWlsd2F1a2VlLWZpc2Vydi1mb3J1bS1tZXJjdXJ5LXRvdXItaG9wZS1oZWxwZWQtb25lLXlvdW5nLWZhbi82OTA2NzA3MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Imagine Dragons had an important message at their Milwaukee concert at Fiserv Forum. I hope it helped one young fan.,"Recognizing the thousands of kids and teenagers at Imagine Dragons' Milwaukee tour stop Friday frontman Dan Reynolds had something to say.

“Don’t ever let anybody make you feel small.”

The sold-out crowd at Fiserv Forum let out a euphoric cheer but a little later in the night my heart sank.

There was a young teenager sitting next to me who was feeling very small because of the actions of another fan in the crowd.

I could tell she was excited to be there as I approached my seat. She was with her friends and seemed to have a new Imagine Dragons handbag.

And as the concert went underway the teen — 15 or so perhaps but it was hard to guess with the mask — was largely hovering over her dimly lit phone on her lap and looking down. And that's fine. Maybe she was overstimulated. Maybe she was anxious to be around a huge crowd again. Honestly it doesn't matter — if that's how she was most comfortable experiencing the show then so be it.

But a nosy older woman behind us wouldn't have it.

""You're missing a great concert"" the woman snapped at her. ""You keep staring at your phone.""

The girl looked startled and embarrassed. ""I'm listening"" she responded meekly.

After that she sank down even lower in her seat practically in a ball. A couple songs later she began to cry.

Fortunately she had a really great friend by her side who validated her covering her with her jacket and putting her arm around her for much of the remainder of the concert.

As we start to gather again at what's hopefully the beginning of the end of the pandemic maybe we could all use a reminder of what a concert should and shouldn't be.

It shouldn't be a place where you can be rude to a stranger and it shouldn't be a place to confront someone with judgment.

A concert should be a safe space where we can process our feelings and escape our worries connected with strangers over a mutual love for the music.

Imagine Dragons' Reynolds understands this and said as much Friday night.

""We ask nothing but just for you to let go to be easy on yourself … to forgive yourself"" he said. ""Leave it all at the door: work politics religion pain school stress hate negativity. … Tonight it is just for you to celebrate yourself celebrate who you are.""

""Above all we hope that you just take whatever you need from tonight"" he continued ""whether it's a shoulder to cry on … to commemorate those we've lost … to celebrate the life we have.

""Whatever it may be you need I hope it's yours.""

Imagine Dragons gets knocked for its earnestness and at times it can be a little much. There were a couple moments Friday night when Reynolds was kneeling before the concert's big screen as it flashed arty images (a shadowy figure running along a beach gold dust flinging off a flying sparrow) set to pretentious narration about ""souls intertwined"" ""highest peaks tied to deepest valleys"" and so on.

But I don't doubt Reynolds' sincerity. And across a two-hour set the band did its best to make everyone feel the music's intent and to feel seen.

Front-loading the setlist with a couple of the band's most sweeping anthems — including ""Believer"" and ""Thunder"" — and overloading the show out of the gate with confetti and fireworks Reynolds ran all along the stage's runways leaping spinning stomping pounding his chest.

Spotting a fan's sign in the pit that read ""You Inspire Me"" he sang part of ""It's Time"" directly to them dropping down to his knees to grasp their hands one of dozens of fans he reached out to throughout the night.

And when it seemed he'd take an extended breather during ""Amsterdam"" joining the rest of the band back on the main stage the respite was brief with Reynolds eventually ending up on the runway again singing with neck bulging intensity looking like he was ready to run through a brick wall.

Imagine Dragons is touring behind last year's ""Mercury — Act 1."" Critics were not kind and it's not likely to generate one of the band's biggest hits. But there were a couple new songs that really registered live.

On ""Lonely"" Reynolds sang of feeling anxious and isolated about forcing a smile ""to keep things easy"" and hiding in corners hoping ""that no one sees me."" Comfort came from Wayne Sermon's pretty acoustic guitar melodies Daniel Platzman and Ben McKee's bass and drum funk break and some wavy '70s-style keys from touring member Elliot Schwartzman.

""Wrecked"" was especially intense live processing grief and overwhelming sadness without sugarcoating or dismissing those feelings. And Reynolds waved a fan's flag that read ""Life Is Worth Living"" during the assuring ""It's OK"" prefacing the song by telling younger fans to ""love yourself "" to ""be passionate"" that they should talk to someone if they feel depressed.

""See a therapist. I have a therapist"" he stressed. ""It doesn't make you weak. It doesn't make you less than. It's not something to be shy about. The whole world needs therapy.""

There was a lot of heaviness Friday so it was nice to see the band was capable of a little musical levity doing a short spry set on the B-stage. There they imagined ""Next to Me"" ""I Bet My Life"" and ""One Day"" with a softer touch and they did a pretty cover of Bob Marley's ""Three Little Birds.""

But the Dragons are best with bombast so they brought the show toward its climax with their biggest hit ""Radioactive"" — the one that was top of the charts in 2013 when there were those infamous bottlenecks at the Summerfest gates for their Miller Lite Oasis set — with Reynolds starting the song quietly on piano and Sermon doing a blistering guitar solo from an elevated platform at the end.

And after the lights went up I was relieved to see the girl who was sitting next to me who had been so crushed earlier leave the show with her head held high thanks to the band and thanks to her friend.

The takeaways

About eight hours before taking the stage in Milwaukee Imagine Dragons canceled shows in Russia and Ukraine this June due to the invasion. And during ""Time"" Reynolds said they were with Ukraine and called for peace.

After performing ""Next to Me"" Reynolds was tipped off by one of his bandmates that a man in the pit had just proposed stopping the show to have the crowd cheer the newly engaged couple and dedicating ""I Bet My Life"" to them.

This was the third show across three consecutive nights at Fiserv Forum preceded by Dua Lipa Wednesday and Tyler The Creator Thursday. In terms of crowd size it was by far the biggest with nearly every seat taken and the floor filled with fans.

The tour is named after Tyler’s recent album by the same name which debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart. The 2019 Best Rap Album Winner is nominated for Best Rap Album and Best Melodic Rap Performance at the 2022 Grammys.

Tyler mentioned the Milwaukee Bucks during his spoken introduction. Fans exclaimed positively given that the performance was taking place in the NBA 2021 Winners’ home arena.

“Milwaukee who are the champions?” Tyler asked. “It’s the Bucks right? I honestly just found that out I don’t follow basketball but congrats guys!”

Fans dressed in clothing reminiscent of the rapper’s diverse album-eras flooded the arena. The evening began with a performance by Teezo Touchdown. The high-energy act was extremely engaging with the crowd as he threw T-shirts and a signed hat into the general admission pit.

Next Vince Staples began performing on the venue’s B-stage. The “Norf Norf” singer brought immaculate energy to the room as fans began to mosh.

Kali Uchis kicked off her set with a song that gained popularity on TikTok titled “Dead to Me”. With high energy breathtaking visual effects and choreographed dance routines Uchis struck the crowd in awe. Her set came to an end with Billboard’s Hot Latin Songs chart-topper “telepatía”.

Tyler the Creator

The crowd erupted in screams and began chanting Tyler’s name as the lights dimmed in anticipation. A short video played and the music to “SIR BAUDELAIRE” began as the rapper emerged from below the stage in a sky-blue Rolls Royce. Fireworks came from the top of the stage immediately as the set began.

Then Tyler was escorted out of his car by his “driver” character the one person who shared the stage with him during his entire set. During songs like “LEMONHEAD” and “HOT WIND BLOWS” he explored the stage’s set which was modeled after a bright-blue mansion.

In the middle of the show Tyler moved to the B-stage in a hydraulic boat between the sides of the GA pit while performing his Grammy-nominated song “WUSYANAME”.

On the B-Stage the design was minimalistic with dead grass patches covering the ground. Here he rapped songs from his older albums Flower Boy Wolf and Goblin. The rapper played with the crowd to see which side could produce the loudest screams.

“Trash…. The Bucks got lucky” Tyler joked at an unsatisfactory crowd reaction from stage left.

After performing a handful of fan favorites like “See You Again” and “Tamale” Tyler took the hydraulic boat back through the crowd to the A-stage.

“Sorry I needed to catch my breath give me like 10 more seconds” Tyler panted once he dismounted the watercraft and found his footing on the main stage.

The climax of the show was “NEW MAGIC WAND” from his Grammy-winning album IGOR. Tyler revealed that it was his favorite song before giving an over-the-top energetic rendition of the song complete with pyrotechnics and intense lighting. Tyler commanded the stage with his captivating dance moves unique flow and undeniable energy.

The ground shook from the song’s bass and the audience’s jumping. He ended the song on the ground after throwing himself around the stage. After a couple more songs Tyler entered the doors to the set house. With that the show came to an end.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWFuY2VtYWdhemluZS5jb20vc2lnaHRzLzEyODY4LXR5bGVyLXRoZS1jcmVhdG9yLWZpc2Vydi1mb3J1bdIBTGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWFuY2VtYWdhemluZS5jb20vc2lnaHRzLzEyODY4LXR5bGVyLXRoZS1jcmVhdG9yLWZpc2Vydi1mb3J1bS9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In photos: Tyler the Creator brings his incredible show to Milwaukee,"Tyler the Creator performing at Fiserv Forum by Dan DeSlover

The Brooklyn Nets defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 126-123 at Fiserv Forum on Saturday ending their two-game losing streak. Kyrie Irving went 14-26 in field goals (FGs) and 8-9 in free throws to drop a season-high 38 points five rebounds five assists and two steals. He had double-digit points in both the second (10) and fourth quarters (12). Moreover in Q3 during which the Nets dominated the floor 43-34 Irving got nine points and four assists leading his team to shoot 8-for-10 from downtown. Irving's last appearance at Fiserv Forum was in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals last season. He sprained his right ankle in that game which was partly why the Bucks managed to come back from a 2-0 deficit.

""It was definitely emotional for me to prepare for this game just because of (that)"" Irving said. ""I haven't been back in the building since then. I try my best not to wear my emotions on my face or on my shoulders but sometimes they can get the best of me. It definitely felt like there was a weight lifted just being back here being healthy getting the win knowing that there's a possibility we could see them down the line again."" The two new guys the Nets acquired in the James Harden-Ben Simmons trade – Seth Curry and Andre Drummond – both made key contributions to the team's victory on Saturday night. Curry scored 12 of his 19 points in the third quarter after draining three shots behind the arc. Drummond got a double-double of 17 points 12 rebounds and five assists. His hands-off plays with Curry worked surprisingly well in Q3.

The Bucks watched their ""Big Three"" – Giannis Antetokounmpo Khris Middleton and Jrue Holiday – combine for 73 points 22 rebounds and 20 assists. Meanwhile Bobby Portis made a career-high eight 3-pointers to get 30 points and 12 rebounds for the team. Such an overwhelming performance by the Bucks' starting lineup was in stark contrast to the disappointing game by their bench unit. Only Serge Ibaka and Wesley Matthews scored off the bench for a combined 13 points. The Bucks' 14 turnovers and poor free throw shooting were the other two reasons that cost them the home game on Saturday. The score difference was never bigger than three in the last three minutes of Q4 but the Bucks missed as many as four free throws in this period. The whole team went 25-for-38 at the free throw line. If they had shot a little better than that they would have not lost by three points in the end.

Third-year guard Ja Morant shot 3-for-4 from beyond the arc and knocked down 13 of his 15 free throw attempts for a regular season career-high of 46 points for the Grizzlies. He already had six games with 40+ points more than anyone else in franchise history. The Bulls played highlights of Michael Jordan on the video board during the game and that might have motivated Morant to show home fans something special.

James Harding Giahyue with The DayLight

When International Consultant Capital (ICC) stopped its logging operations in Nimba County in 2019 it was already owing villagers over US$55000 having used their land and felled their timbers leaving behind broken development promises and an estimated 7000 logs according to locals.

ICC and the Gbi-Doru Administrative District had signed the 10-year social agreement in 2010 as part of forest management contract area K—commonly called FMC-K Nimba in the forestry sector—covering 127842 hectares. FMC-K is the largest logging concession in Liberia extending to River Cess and Grand Gedeh and totaling 266910 hectares of woodlands.

The same year ICC parked off from Gbi-Doru African Wood & Lumber Company (AWL)—now owned by Italian businessman Cesare Colombo ICC’s CEO—signed logging deals with two community forests. In January Colombo secured the agreement with Gbarsaw & Dorbor for 21230 hectares of forest in Norwien District River Cess County for five years. Later in July he concluded the deal with Marblee & Karblee between Compound Number One and Two Grand Bassa giving him logging rights in its 24355-hectare woodland for the same duration. AWL had been established in 2015 by a Liberian businessman called Krangar Logan and Colombo became its sole shareholder as of March last year the company’s article of incorporation shows.

Like ICC in Gbi-Doru AWL’s agreements with Gbarsaw & Dorbor and Marblee & Karblee have been marred by broken promises and indebtedness to the communities in land and log-harvesting fees. With no clauses in the deals for things like schools and clinics commonplace in logging contracts both communities solely rely on harvesting fees to conduct development projects such as roads schools and clinics.

AWL owes Gbarsaw & Dorbor US$5000 for human resource development and US$37786 land rental fees the leadership of the community forest told The DayLight.

Colombo blames his company’s indebtedness to that community on illegal chainsaw milling. Also called pit-saw milling in the Liberian logging industry chainsaw milling involved the use of chainsaws to rip logs into planks. The practice which is currently unregulated has increasingly become a nuisance across the forestry sector.

The situation in Marblee & karblee is even worse. The company owes the community US$39000 for the use of its forestland US$6000 for scholarship and has failed to pave dirt roads in that area in the last three years according to locals. The Forestry Development Authority (FDA) did not grant our request for AWL’s record of payments and production though the National Forestry Reform Law guarantees public access to such information. However it harvested 6136.59 cubic meters of logs from November 2020 to June last year records of the company’s production The DayLight obtained show. That means the company owes the villagers US$38353 representing harvesting and development fees in line with their agreement.

“We are coming to have [a] meeting to write the company. If they don’t want the forest again let them give it back to us” says Arthur Bayogar a community forest leader.

Colombo again denies any wrongdoing adding that the company had also not paid the Marblee & Karblee the full amount due to illegal chainsaw-milling activities. He demands the community pays his company for every log the pit-sawyers harvested.

“The outstanding payment [is] due to the pit-sawing activity that is not allowed in the concession” Colombo tells The DayLight in an emailed interview. “And for each log felled compensation to the company [needs] to be calculated.”

‘Taking advantage’

Forest governance campaigners say Colombo’s move from FMC- K Nimba to community forests in River Cess and Grand Bassa is part of a new trend across the forestry sector. The last five years have seen companies and individuals associated with large logging agreements turn to community forests. Under Liberian laws and regulations companies enter logging concessions with the government but sign community forest deals directly with villagers. A guiding principle of forestry reform in Liberia the scheme was meant to ensure rural towns and villages benefit from forest resources denied them for generations. But that has not worked for many communities with companies being indebted to locals rife some for over a decade.

Andrew Zelemen a campaigner with the National Union of Community Forest Development Committee (NUCFDC) says Colombo and other businesspeople are exploiting the weakness of communities.

“My understanding is that some of these companies are taking advantage of the limited capacity of community members who are awarding these concessions to them” Zelemen whose group advocates for communities affected by large-scale concessions tells me in a mobile phone conversation from Lofa. He says Colombo needs to explain why he left FMC-K for Gbarsaw & Dorbor and Marblee & karblee.

“Something is wrong somewhere and something is happening and these companies need to tell us what they are doing the Liberian people’s forests” he adds.

Bonathan Walaka the secretary of the National Union of Community Forest Management Body (NUCFMB) agrees with Zelemen and says he understands Colombo’s shift to community forests.

“The reason is just simple” Walaka says. “The land rental fees companies pay the government in FMCs are more than what they pay the government in community forests.” He argues Colombo saves more money from failing to pay Marblee & Karblee for instance than refusing to pay Gbi-Doru. By lay companies pay communities 30 percent and the government 70 percent in land rental fees for large concessions such as FMC-K and 55 and 45 percent in the same order for community forests. By law land rental fees are the product of US$1.25 and the size of hectares of a given forest.

“The government has the power to have the companies pay its share of land rental fees but the communities don’t” Walaka says.

Walaka’s comments make correct reference to the law. The FDA is not a party in community forest agreements but approves them as the government institution that oversees the forestry sector. The laws and regulations governing the sector are largely communities-centered.

However in the cases of Gbarsaw & Dorbor and Marblee & Karblee the FDA did not enforce those laws. For instance despite debt to both communities the FDA sanctioned three shipments of a combined 7286.24 cubic meters of timbers produced by AWL between February and April last year according to record of the exports we got. That is a violation of the Ten Core Regulations which call for firms to be clear of all forest-related dues before export. It is even sufficient ground for the FDA to terminate AWL’s agreement per the National Forestry Reform Law.

No law or regulation bars an individual associated with a company that has outstanding payments from obtaining a logging contract. But Jonathan Yiah the lead forestry campaigner at the Sustainable Development Institute (SDI) thinks FDA did not exercise its oversight in Colombo’s community forest deals. He says it should have disapproved the Italian businessman’s deal with Gbarsaw & Dorbor and Marblee & Karblee over his connection to ICC and FMC-K.

“FDA allowing this to happen aids companies to be in huge arrears with communities” Yiah says in an emailed interview. “FDA needs to ensure proper due diligence it has responsibility for is conducted.

“Once due diligence is done on each of the companies currently operating the problem with logging operations in community forest may be reduced” he adds.

Colombo refutes those criticisms counterarguing that he invested millions in the communities to “create a cordial and friendly relationship” with locals.

“We are always committed to our obligation and we never undermine the intent of the forestry reform in Liberia” Colombo says despite evidence showing the opposite.

The FDA did not grant our request for an interview on the matter. The DayLight wrote Deputy Managing Director Joseph Tally for the interview last month but did not get a reply up to press time.

Special to The Monroe News

Joseph Van Blerck was an “engine engineer” whose work benefited Henry Ford’s growing automobile company as well as spawning what became the Van Blerck Motor Company which called Monroe home from 1913 to 1922.

The company was founded in Detroit in 1910 shortly after he completed the prototype for the 1909 Model T engine for Ford. Van Blerck’s marine engines became favorites of the emerging powerboat racing sport and also served in military and commercial applications.

According to the October 1913 issue of ""Motor Boating"" the development of the Monroe facility was strategically located near the River Raisin to take advantage of maritime shipping opportunities as well as other rail and emerging highway transportation opportunities along the Toledo-Detroit-Windsor Highway.

The East First Street plant was slated to be quite modern for the era. Van Blerck’s building engineer planned construction of a fireproof brick steel and concrete factory 60 feet wide by 176 ½ feet long that would meet current space needs and allow for expansion.

The latest electric infrastructure (including its own power plant) was also to be included along with an overall design that utilized large windows for both the factory and office spaces. The Van Blerck Motor Company’s Monroe plant also housed a testing room that simulated boat angles for engine placement with the option of creating actual prototypes for testing in both the River Raisin and Lake Erie.

The 1914 grand opening was a spectacle and included invitations that touted the plant’s strategic location -- 45 minutes from Toledo and 1 ¼ hours from Detroit. Van Blerck then introduced standardization in his manufacturing processes and began producing the marine and commercial engines that were identified with either single or double letters. For example the D and DD engines that the company produced were used in fire equipment electrical generating sets pumping stations and trucks / farm tractors. Series E E-Special and the EE engines were marine engines that dominated motorboat racing in the 1910's.

One of Van Blerck’s most successful motorboat racing partnerships was with boat builder S.A Ferris who built the Hacker designed the Hawk Eye at the Van Blerck Motor Company plant in 1914 and Van Blerck installed a 12-cylinder engine of his own design and construction. It improved on designs Van Blerk had collaborated on including the Van Blerck-powered Kitty Hawk that set a speed record of 60 miles per hour earlier that year.

Of the many products that used Van Blerck engines one of the most interesting products using a Van Blerck motor is the 1915 Van Blerck 17 Liter a race car produced by Gary Wales that produced 200 horsepower and had a cubic inch displacement in the 1000 range. The one-of-a-kind car recently sold for $288200 at auction.

While Van Blerck was a talented engine engineer historical sources identify his lack of business acumen as a roadblock for both the development of the Monroe plant and the later plant locations in Akron Ohio (1919) and Plainfield New Jersey (ca. 1924). There were also sales offices located in New York and Washington D.C.

This announcement appeared in the August 19 1922 edition of the Monroe Evening News with the headline “Getting Factory In Readiness”: The Detroit Stoker Company which recently purchased the Van Blerck Motor Company's buildings on East First street has a number of men getting the factory in shape for its opening. It is said that the company will start operation about September 1 and will employ many people.

The Detroit Stoker Company is still thriving at the former Van Blerck Motor Company location at 1510 East First Street in Monroe.

In addition to the three-row the launch will bring together chief platform engineer Ian Foston and design head Max Wolff.Spied in Australia Europe and the United States with minimal camouflage and coil-sprung rear suspension  the family-oriented utility vehicle is dubbed Endeavor in the Indian market. So far the Ford Motor Company has confirmed production in Thailand where FoMoCo will invest $900 million to support the production of the SUV and its Ranger-badged sibling.Just like the second-generation Everest we’re looking forward to various diesel engines for the Australian market whereas China is likely to receive a four-cylinder turbo. The 2.0-liter EcoBlue and 2.3-liter EcoBoost seem to be the culprits together with the 10R ten-speed automatic transmission.As far as the all-new Ranger is concerned the Dearborn-based automaker has confirmed a 3.0-liter turbo diesel V6 engine in addition to the single- and bi-turbo EcoBlue mentioned in the previous paragraph. The Ranger Raptor was recently confirmed with the 3.0-liter EcoBoost and the bi-turbo EcoBlue but still don’t hold your breath for the Raptor-infused Everest.Imagined with the Raptor’s exterior design cues by pixel artist Joao Kleber Amaral the dune-bashing utility vehicle would cannibalize with its pickup sibling. Even though body-on-frame utility vehicle sales are on the rise in the Asia-Pacific reason the Everest still is a small fish in a pond that also includes heavyweights like the Toyota Fortuner and Land Cruiser Prado.Unfortunately for North America the Ford Motor Company has no plans of bringing the Everest stateside as the three-row alternative to the Bronco. But on the upside the all-new Ranger Raptor will be produced in Wayne at the Michigan Assembly Plant alongside the all-new Ranger and Bronco.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXRvZXZvbHV0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2luLTE5MTYtMTAwLWdvdC15b3UtYS1mb3JkLXRlbGVzY29waW5nLWFwYXJ0bWVudC10aGUtd29ybGQtcy1maXJzdC1zbGlkZW91dC1jYW1wZXItMTgyNjY0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"In 1916 $100 Got You a ""Ford"" Telescoping Apartment the World's First Slideout Camper","The early 1900s saw the beginning and rise of an automotive company that we would still be talking about over 100 years later. Heck people are still driving Ford vehicles in just about any country in the world. But few people know that there was once a glamping habitat that could be mounted to of-era Model Ts.

Folks just to make things clear what you'll be witnessing today is nothing more than one of the most accurate replicas of a mobile habitat from back in 1916 the Automobile Telescopic Apartment most commonly known as the ""Ford"" Telescoping Apartment. You'll understand why the quotations around Ford shortly. No joke this is a real project with even more real roots As Ford was hitting the streets with vehicle after vehicle a gentleman out in California was hard at work developing what the RV/MH Hall of Fame regard as ""the world's first patented slideout camper."" It's called the Automobile Telescopic Camper and while Ford wasn't the manufacturer of this RV the U.S. Patent Office has a record of this camper from 1916. The creator Gustave De Bretteville made sure to make it applicable to Ford vehicles Model Ts in particular. Images from an old Popular Mechanics magazine reveal the camper sitting on Model Ts from as early as 1915. R&D probably goes back even further.Now the downside to this story is that there seem to be just two units alive. One was sold to the RV/MH Hall of Fame by RV historian David Woodward and the second is the one seen in the videos below. The second was created by Herb the gentleman in the video based on direct interactions with the original. He even stayed true to the screws and dovetails used to put together the original cabinets and shelves. And it seems to be the only one roaming around the U.S. in working condition (we'll talk about that later).Now finding a Model T like the ones meant for the Telescopic Apartment is rather hard to find so Herb realized that a 1924 Model T Runabout had just the right flatbed to fit the original measurements. Luckily for Herb he found a Runabout at an auction with an engine that required very little engine work and basically went to town on it creating the machine you see here today. Yes everything has been restored by Herb including the paint job.As for the habitat the camper is initially that turtleback mounted on the T. Well as it is telescopic there's another shell inside that is to be pulled out. Only once the interior is extended outward does this mobile home really show what it can do.Looking at it from the rear the Apartment reveals two lateral spaces mounted into the interior shell. Those too are pulled out with a telescopic action. On the right side you can see an array of drawers and cabinetry used to store clothing and other utensils while on the left side the galley is found. Because Herb is a very serious fellow he even includes of-era gas cooker and tins among other things.The original version was even marketed with a shower attachment fed from a water tank on the roof. While Herb's version does not I really don't think that even matters anymore; this thing is still a dang unicorn. The best part about what you've read and witnessed today is that this sucker is for sale! No joke. In one video Freighter Jim the channel's host mentions that this replica is looking for a new ""caretaker.""Now people keep calling this thing a replica but in my opinion that just doesn't matter ; it's hella original. I personally haven't contacted Herb or Jim but if you do leave a comment with how much this puppy is being sold for. However I can give you a hint on how much you're NOT going to pay 100 USD (88 EUR at current exchange rates) the price you would have paid back in 1916 for an original Telescopic Apartment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ2dHJhdmVsLmNvbS9mb3JkLXJlY2FsbHMtMzUwLTQ1MC12ZWhpY2xlcy1wb3dlci1zdGVlcmluZy1kYW5nZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford recalls some E-350 and E-450 vehicles for power steering danger,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.rvtravel.com/ford-recalls-350-450-vehicles-power-steering-danger/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ2dHJhdmVsLmNvbS9mb3JkLXJlY2FsbHMtMzUwLTQ1MC12ZWhpY2xlcy1wb3dlci1zdGVlcmluZy1kYW5nZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Licht could not be reached for immediate comment and a CNN spokesperson referred an inquiry to Discovery. A Discovery executive declined to comment. Executives at CBS where Licht currently oversees “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” and is an executive vice president involved with programming strategies were not able to offer immediate comment. Puck previously reported the new deal which is said to have been cemented by Discovery CEO David Zaslav who lured Licht away from a growing development deal that Colbert and his senior team have put together with Paramount Global CBS’ parent company.

A formal announcement could come as soon as next week according to one of the people familiar with the situation. Licht is not likely to start in the new role for several weeks as he finishes the terms of his contract at CBS and its parent. A meeting was slated to take placed Saturday afternoon among staffers of CBS “Late Show” according to a person familiar with the program. A “Late Show” spokesperson could not be reached for immediate comment.

In hiring Licht Zaslav has lured an executive with qualities similar to Jeff Zucker the former CNN chief whose facility with talent and news production lent CNN new relevance in recent years. Licht has worked closely with everyone from Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski to Norah O’Donnell and Gayle King and has developed a sort of middle-lane format that mixes serious reportage with the lighter fare one needs to succeed in both morning TV and the medium’s late-night wars. Under his aegis as showrunner CBS has usurped NBC as the backer of the nation’s most-watched late-night program with a formula that often has Colbert speaking with top newsmakers as much as he does movie actors and rock stars. Licht will not take over WarnerMedia’s sports operations which had also previously reported to Zucker according to the two people.

The new chief will face heady challenges as well. His predecessor Zucker was ousted earlier this month after failing to disclose a personal relationship with Allison Gollust CNN’s former chief marketing officer. News staffers who developed strong ties that executive over the past decade as CNN became a regular target of the Trump administration have been demoralized by his ouster as well as the firing of former primetime anchor Chris Cuomo. CNN is poised to launch a new streaming-video service CNN Plus but there are questions about whether Discovery which has strong roots in unscripted and documentary-style programming sees the need for such a stand-alone service. “We will in the next in the near-term sit down and get a have a real business plan. discussion with the people that CNN and CNN Plus” Zaslav said in a call with investors earlier this week. “We haven’t had that yet.”

Indeed while Licht has run sizable TV operations he has never commanded a structure as big as CNN a WarnerMedia unit that has in recent years generated over $1 billion in profit and has become as key to the financials of WarnerMedia as Fox News has to its own parent Fox Corporation. CNN isn’t only a series of U.S. news programs. It also has a significant international operation and a large affiliate business that puts its news footage on local stations. CNN also includes HLN the cable network that has struggled to find an identity in recent years.

Under Zucker CNN took on more voice growing beyond its long identity as a vanilla dispenser of down-the-middle news reportage. Anchors have been encouraged to offer analysis and opinion and even get passionate about the top stories of the day. Discovery is expected to make changes potentially placing renewed emphasis on boots-on-the-ground reportage. “There’s no organization news organization in the world that looks like CNN that can do what CNN does. I think it becomes very clear as you go around the world and you look at other news channels that are where people are sitting behind desks and giving their opinion about what’s going on” Zaslav said during the recent investor call talking about CNN’s coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “There’s a news network that’s on the ground with journalists in bulletproof vests and helmets that are doing what journalists do best which is fight to tell the truth in dangerous places so that we all can be safe and we can assess what’s going on and what’s dangerous in the world.”

CNN and its rivals have long thrived as sources of go-to information and increasingly hot-talk opinion about the trending news of the day. But in the world of streaming video their dominance faces new challenges. The networks have seen viewership decline in the wake of the end of the runup to the 2020 election and the aftermath of the January 6 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. CNN’s primetime viewership among people between 25 and 54 — the demographic most favored by advertisers — was off 46% in 2021 according to Nielsen. MSNBC’s was down by 38% and Fox News Channel’s declined by 41%. All three networks are expected to shed subscribers in 2022 according to Kagan the market-research firm that its part of S&P Global Intelligence as consumers move away from traditional cable and satellite subscriptions.

The company said in September it could invest as much as $95 billion in Europe over the next decade and announce the locations of two major new European chip fabrication plants by the end of 2021 but no announcement has been made.

Germany was top of the list of potential locations with the local governments of Penzing in Bavaria and Magdeburg and Dresden in eastern Germany trying to tempt the U.S. company.

Analysts had said Intel could be waiting for the introduction of new legislation before deciding on a European location. The European Chips Act aims to reduce the continent's dependence on Asian suppliers for advanced semiconductors by subsidizing the local development of large chip factories.

INTEL TO INVEST AT LEAST $20 BILLION IN OHIO CHIP-MAKING FACILITY

Chief Executive Patrick Gelsinger traveled to Europe last year. The government subsidies stability and availability of skilled workers were factors that encouraged the CEO to choose Germany for the new plant the source said.

Germany is also home to many of the world's biggest automakers which have been particularly badly hit by the global chip shortage.

The small city of Magdeburg is the capital of Saxony-Anhalt state. It hosts the Otto von Guericke University and has space for a new plant in the Eulenberg industrial area in the southwest.

The company said in September it could invest as much as $95 billion in Europe over the next decade and announce the locations of two major new European chip fabrication plants by the end of 2021 but no announcement has been made.

Germany was top of the list of potential locations with the local governments of Penzing in Bavaria and Magdeburg and Dresden in eastern Germany trying to tempt the U.S. company.

Analysts had said Intel could be waiting for the introduction of new legislation before deciding on a European location. The European Chips Act aims to reduce the continent's dependence on Asian suppliers for advanced semiconductors by subsidizing the local development of large chip factories.

Chief Executive Patrick Gelsinger traveled to Europe last year. The government subsidies stability and availability of skilled workers were factors that encouraged the CEO to choose Germany for the new plant the source said.

Germany is also home to many of the world's biggest automakers which have been particularly badly hit by the global chip shortage.

Contributed Article

SAFFORD – The Gila Valley Arts Council is proud to present The Fitzgeralds on Wednesday March 9 starting at 7 p.m. at the David M. Player Center for the Arts on the campus of Safford High School.

The Fitzgeralds are some of the most talented energetic animated and genuine performers you will come across. This is a group of entertainers who truly love what they are doing and thrive on interaction with their audiences. Presenters can expect a high-caliber polished varied and action-packed show with some goofiness thrown in here and there. They even step dance and fiddle at the same time!

A family group consisting of fiddling and step dancing siblings – Tom Kerry and Julie Fitzgerald. These siblings from just outside of Canada’s renowned Ottawa Valley have come a long way from their small-town roots. Featuring three-time Canadian Grandmaster Fiddle Champions and Ontario Open Step Dance Champions this unique act features high-energy fiddling and mind-blowing step dancing. It is the rare combination of exceptional musicianship incomparable step dancing audience interaction evident love of performing and genuine sibling connection that resonates with audiences of all ages and sets this group apart.

The Fitzgerald siblings were raised in a musical household and toured internationally with their family band “Everything Fitz”. Growing up on the outskirts of the Ottawa Valley they were immersed in the rich tradition of Canadian Old Time fiddling and step dancing that evolved with the arrival of Irish Scottish and French immigrants. Over time they have developed their art form to include various styles of fiddle music including Celtic jazz bluegrass French-Canadian and pop. They have also explored other dance forms including tap and Irish. The siblings continue to push boundaries by fusing traditional and modern styles of fiddle and dance to create their own unique sound and style. Their creativity and passion for experimentation have led them to compose original tunes and arrangements some of which were released on their latest album. The result is a groovy and catchy new sound and look that appeals to all ages.

Julie Fitzgerald is a two-time Canadian Grand Masters Fiddle Champion as well as a two-time Open Step Dance Champion. She has had the opportunity to perform internationally with many of her lifelong musical ‘idols’ including Leahy Natalie MacMaster members of Stepcrew & Bowfire Troy MacGillivray and Wayne Rostad. While touring with The StepCrew Julie has also had the opportunity to share the stage with Sharon Shannon We Banjo 3 Carlos Nunez Solas and Eileen Ivers.

Julie graduated from Humber College (Toronto) with the Bachelor of Music program. Julie’s love of passing on the Canadian traditional music and dance led to the creation of her first (and certainly not the last!) instructional step dance DVD. Whenever she is taking a break from touring Julie teaches private dance and fiddle lessons to students in the Peterborough area. Because of her experience as a touring musician she realizes how many people across North America are introduced to and interested in learning more about Canadian step dancing. In response to this observation she is now offering online step dance instruction directly off of her website!

​Kerry Fitzgerald is a fiddler and step dancer originally from Bancroft ON Canada now based in Toronto ON. Her musical roots are Ottawa-Valley fiddling and step dancing. She has also explored Celtic and other folk styles. Her performing career began at a young age with her family group Everything Fitz which has taken her on several extensive North American tours

In addition to performing Kerry teaches music workshops private lessons and music camps including Leahy Music Camp AlgomaTrad and Orangeville Fiddle Camp. On the competition scene she is an Ontario Open Step dance Champion and Canadian Grand Masters Fiddle Finalist. She now judges both fiddle and step dance competitions including the Ontario Open competition. Aside from touring Kerry experiments with electronic arrangements of original fiddle tunes. She is currently collaborating with DJ/Producer Jay Andrews in his “Shreem” project. Between tours she completed a double major in Kinesiology and Foods & Nutrition at Western University.

​Tom Fitzgerald is an accomplished musician from Bancroft Ontario. While much of his focus has been directed towards the study of the fiddle Tom is also accomplished on the guitar mandolin and as a step-dancer. He is a Canadian Grand Master Fiddle Champion (2012) and a Canadian Open Fiddle Champion (2012) and has performed with Natalie MacMaster Leahy Nathan Carter Tommy Hunter Tony McManus Brian Finnegan Wayne Rostad We Banjo 3 and others. Growing up in the center of the Ottawa Valley Tom was immersed in the rich tradition of Canadian Old Time fiddling and step dancing that evolved with the arrival of Irish Scottish and French immigrants. However over the years he has absorbed other musical styles and traditions such as Celtic country bluegrass swing jazz R&B and classical which allows him to effortlessly fit into almost any musical situation.

In 2017 Tom completed the Bachelor of Music program at Humber College in Toronto Ontario where he studied jazz violin. In his final year Tom recorded a three-track EP which you can find on his website. Tom is continuing to develop his craft and currently working towards a full-length solo album available in the far and distant future. When not on tour he also teaches privately and has been an instructor at various music camps/workshops across Canada including the Leahy Music Camp Algoma Trad Smithers BC Orangeville Fiddle Camp and Goderich Celtic College.

This technology could mean that consumers no longer need to choose between the high-quality display and ‘never ending’ battery life available through solar energy.

4 Reviews

Garmin has filed a patent for an energy-collecting display module. The patent filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) describes how Garmin could combine solar charging and OLED display technology in future devices.

If this technology comes to life it would mean that users would no longer have to choose between the long running time available through solar power as seen in the Instinct 2 Solar or the high-quality OLED display as used in the Epix 2.

Garmin’s solar-powered smartwatches currently use a memory-in-pixel (MIP) display which has reduced screen brightness and depth of color compared to OLED displays. The partially transparent Power Glass which these devices use for solar charging would negatively impact the quality of an OLED display.

The proposed new technology layers the solar cells between the sub-pixels of the OLED display which should allow solar charging with a brighter screen than the MIP display currently used. However the interspersed photovoltaic regions might mean that this specialized OLED display would be darker than the standard OLED equivalent. Still there is no evidence to support this theory at the moment.

The patent application suggests that Garmin might also use this new OLED display in products as a handheld GPS device. It is unclear if or when the company would launch products with this new specialized display panel.

As you may know I’ve started a new independent venture called Apple Buying Advice to offer quick Apple product advice to regular people who want to buy Apple gear but aren’t technology hobbyists. Front-page picks are intended to satisfy most people and short guides go into further detail with the Jobsian intent of narrowing Apple’s increasingly overwhelming list of options.

My front-page Apple Watch pick is the GPS-only Apple Watch Series 7 and in the accompanying guide I explained why I felt cellular connectivity is a waste of money for most people. Hoo boy were you quick to set me straight! Many readers pointed out that a cellular Apple Watch is valuable for those whose clothes lack or have insufficient pockets those who want to be able to call 911 from their wrist if they feel threatened and those for whom the fall-detection feature could be a lifesaver.

In my defense I didn’t discourage cellular Apple Watches entirely. For the Family Setup feature which lets you set up an Apple Watch for a loved one who doesn’t have an iPhone cellular is required quite reasonably. But since an Apple Watch configured via Family Setup does not support ECG or irregular heart rhythm notifications (among much else) I recommend the cellular Apple Watch SE for that purpose. It doesn’t have those features anyway and it’s quite a bit cheaper than the Apple Watch Series 7 so why pay more?

Also in my defense my wife always has pockets even when she’s wearing a dress. But she’s not a good example since she once owned an Apple Watch and doesn’t want another regardless of how it communicates with the outside world.

So who should buy a cellular Apple Watch? And who should save their money?

Reasons to Avoid the Cellular Apple Watch

First off a cellular Apple Watch isn’t generally a way to avoid owning an iPhone. Unless another person in your family sets up your Apple Watch with their iPhone you’ll need an iPhone anyway. And as I mentioned watches using Family Setup lack some potentially welcome features.

The base price of an aluminum Apple Watch Series 7 is $399 and the cellular model is $499 a whopping $100 increase or 25% more. But it’s hard to make apples-to-apples comparisons across the Apple Watch line. For the $279 Apple Watch SE cellular adds only $50—about 11% more. The luxury Apple Watch Edition and Apple Watch Hermès models are cellular-only which simplifies things. So you can see—from a cost perspective—why I recommended the cellular Apple Watch SE but not the cellular Apple Watch Series 7.

You must also factor in the monthly service fee which hovers around $10 per month or an extra $120 per year plus taxes and additional fees. Although you’re fine if you use one of the Big Three carriers in the US—AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless—only a few smaller carriers and MVNOs (mobile virtual network operators) support the Apple Watch and even fewer of those support Family Setup. So if you’re like me or others who prefer to work with an MVNO that resells access to another carrier’s network a cellular Apple Watch may not be an option (see “Consumer Cellular Offers Cheap No-Nonsense Access to AT&T’s Cellular Network” 12 July 2021).

Let’s say you buy a cellular Apple Watch Series 7 and pay for service for 4 years. That would increase the cost from $399 to $979—a $580 difference. Obviously if you’re going to make use of that connectivity it’s your money to spend but if not it’s a lot to waste.

Note that you can buy a cellular Apple Watch but choose not to activate it. Adam Engst took that path several years ago when he bought an Apple Watch Series 5 (see “Upgrading from an Apple Watch Series 2 to a Series 5” 20 January 2020). That gave him the flexibility to pay for the cellular connectivity if it ever became useful to him (it hasn’t) and so he could pass it on to his wife Tonya who relies heavily on the cellular capabilities of the Apple Watch (alas she opted to buy a new cellular Apple Watch SE instead). The cellular capability might still improve the trade-in or resale value and it will still call 911 if that ever becomes necessary for him.

Many people buy and activate a cellular Apple Watch only to change their minds later because the benefits don’t end up justifying the cost. In part that’s because Apple’s built-in features like messaging and fitness tracking are the main win not third-party apps (see “How I Finally Embraced the Apple Watch as a Fitness Tracker” 7 February 2022). For instance you might think it would be helpful to be able to call an Uber from your wrist if you twisted an ankle while on a run only to realize that Uber and other developers have given up on Apple Watch development.

Reasons to Get a Cellular Apple Watch

Let’s answer the core question: do you need cellular in your Apple Watch? My guess is probably not but there are some good reasons to get it:

Separated from an iPhone: If you need to be out in the world without your iPhone having a cellular Apple Watch gives you basic communication capabilities. This might be the case if you exercise without your iPhone or if you sometimes forget your iPhone due to a lack of sufficient pockets.

This might be the case if you exercise without your iPhone or if you sometimes forget your iPhone due to a lack of sufficient pockets. Increased safety: If you’re concerned about your personal safety while away from home a cellular Apple Watch might enable you to place an emergency call more quickly or surreptitiously than with an iPhone. It could also help a family member see your location using Find My. And as noted you can make 911 calls even without paying for an account.

Fall detection: If you’re concerned about falling and not being able to get up or call for help the fall-detection feature on a cellular Apple Watch could trigger an automatic lifesaving call to emergency services or make it easier to initiate a manual call.

Family Setup: If you’re getting an Apple Watch for a child or senior who doesn’t have an iPhone Family Setup requires a cellular Apple Watch.

Those are the most common reasons someone would need a cellular Apple Watch sufficiently to justify the expense. If you have other reasons—particularly apps that take advantage of cellular connectivity—please let us know what they are in the comments."

Grass type Sprigatito is described as a ""capricious attention-seeking Grass Cat Pokémon"" whilst Fire type Fuecoco is ""the laid-back Fire Croc Pokémon that does things at its own pace.

That leaves the delightfully named Quaxly a water type duck who is an ""earnest and tidy"" Duckling Pokémon.

Original story follows.

Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet are coming to Switch later this year.

Revealing the new Pokémon instalment at today's Pokémon Presents this ""all-new entry in the Pokémon series"" is expected to release worldwide in ""late 2022"" on Switch.

You can watch the full announcement trailer below:

Beyond that little was given away beyond confirmation that it will be ""an open-world adventure"" likely not dissimilar to the later Pokémon titles.

We also got a peek at three as yet unnamed Gen 9 Pokémon - a grass type a fire type and a water type all of which are very cute - and some stunning landscapes in both glorious sunshine and under the shine of the moon.

Oh look it’s that massive highly anticipated game that everyone’s excited about! It’s only just released and it’s what all the gamers on the internet have been talking about. Wait what do you mean they’ve already forgotten about it?

Poor Aloy. Her latest adventure has been praised as an excellent sequel to 2017’s Horizon Zero Dawn and yet just over a week on from its release everyone’s already moved on to Elden Ring. I mean I can’t really say I blame them given how groundbreaking the latter is but still.

While you're here be sure to check out some gameplay footage for Horizon Forbidden West below.

Even if the attention has very quickly shifted away from it though Forbidden West is still doing really well. Not only was it the best selling boxed game in the UK last week but it was also the best-selling digital game too.

Advert

According to a report from GamesIndustry.biz the latest games sale data has shown that just short of half of the game’s sales (49% to be exact) were digital via the PSN store. Just for comparison’s sake those digital sales are double what Zero Dawn managed in March 2017 the month after its release and this is only in the span of a week.

The PS5 version of the game is continuing to be the most popular too - reportedly 67% of the digital sales were for the new-gen version. Those are really similar figures to last week’s physical sales - around two thirds of the boxed copies were for the PS5 editions. On one hand that’s hardly surprising - the game looks significantly better on there but equally anyone who buys the PS4 version which costs £10 less can upgrade for free. Be sure to keep that in mind if you’ve not already bought it yourself anyway.

As I said at the start chances are basically everyone is going to be shifting their focus over to Elden Ring now but we still think Forbidden West is worth playing - in our review we said that it “takes everything that worked in its acclaimed predecessor and builds upon it in spectacular style”. So we still love you Aloy even if your game’s release timing was a bit poor.

Listen

WASHINGTON D.C. — Sulpician Father Dominic Ciriaco finds inspiration for preaching in the vibrant serigraphs of artist Corita Kent who created art as a religious sister and later as a former religious.

And he hopes the seminarians he leads as rector of Theological College in Washington will be inspired too.

An exhibit of Kent’s work currently on display at the seminary explores “how the preacher can turn to the art world for inspiration when preparing and preaching a homily.”

“Her serigraphs became her pulpit as her artwork preached the Gospel and challenged people to put their faith into practice” Ciriaco said.

As Sister Mary Corita Kent a member of the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in the Los Angeles Archdiocese and as a former religious later in her life the artist used Scripture passages psalms and messages about war and peace love poverty and social justice in her prints.

She also drew on the imagery of everyday products and companies from Wonder Bread to Sunkist to General Mills.

Her artwork was particularly popular in the 1960s and 1970s. One of her creations that might be most familiar to the general public is the “Love” stamp she created for the U.S. Post Office in 1985.

Ciriaco put the exhibit together titling it “Beauty and the Priest: Preaching with the Artwork of Corita Kent.” It’s a play on “Beauty and the Beast” as he explained in comments opening the show Feb. 3.

In the movie he said “Belle had to look beyond the exterior of the Beast to see the beauty within and the Beast likewise experienced the love and acceptance from Belle who then began to change the Beast’s disposition on life and himself. The artist’s eye can help the preacher do the same with their preaching.”

Creating the exhibit also fulfills one of the last requirements he needs to complete his doctorate in ministry in preaching from the Aquinas Institute of Theology in St. Louis. He had to do a thesis project on preaching geared toward his ministry which is seminary formation.

In a Feb. 17 interview with Catholic News Service Ciriaco said he first encountered Kent’s work through his religious order the Society of St. Sulpice.

Many of her works are at the order’s provincial house in Baltimore. Others are in the archives at St. Mary’s Seminary and University run by the Sulpicians in Baltimore. The order also operates Theological College which is affiliated with The Catholic University of America.

“I immediately fell in love with her work” said Ciriaco who had help in pulling the exhibit together from Catholic University art students.

The artist who died of cancer in 1986 bequeathed the pieces to the Sulpician priest who was her spiritual director — Father Robert Giguere. He left the artwork to the order when he died.

Kent’s artistry took flight as a woman religious. She joined the Immaculate Heart of Mary community when she was 18. Born Frances Elizabeth Kent in Fort Dodge Iowa in 1918 she took Mary Corita as her religious name; “Corita” means “little heart.”

A self-taught artist she earned a bachelor’s degree at Immaculate Heart College which was run by her community and received a master’s degree at the University of Southern California.

She taught art classes at the college eventually becoming the chair of its art department in 1964.

Amid the Second Vatican Council and the changes it brought to the church her religious community adopted reforms that put the sisters into conflict with Cardinal James F. McIntyre then archbishop of Los Angeles. The dispute led to many sisters leaving; those who stayed created an ecumenical community that welcomed laypeople.

Kent took a sabbatical in Cape Cod Massachusetts in 1968 and decided to leave religious life. She moved to Boston and continued to create art.

By the time she went on sabbatical Ciriaco said she was exhausted in part because of the labor-intensive process of making serigraphs.

In general only one or two color applications can be made per day with long drying times in between. She chose serigraphs though because every image she produced was an original but affordable for those who wanted to own her work.

Ciriaco said Kent also was stressed by Cardinal McIntyre’s criticism of her order and her work in particular.

“Vatican II was going too fast for him” the priest noted.

One image the cardinal particularly disliked and “was a scandal to him” — and one Ciriaco included in the exhibit — was a Kent print comparing Mary to a “tomato” which at the time was slang for an attractive woman.

“What a tomato! She used a slang term to give homage to Mary that Mary is the one — the juiciest tomato of all” the priest explained.

The Theological College exhibit includes display cases with photos of Kent at various points in her life with several of her working in her studio at Immaculate Heart College in full habit. In a couple of photos students gather around while she demonstrates how to make a print.

The items on display include a children’s picture book “Make Meatballs Sing: The Life and Art of Corita Kent” published in 2021 by Enchanted Lion an independent children’s book publisher in Brooklyn New York.

Among the exhibit’s prints is one of St. Thomas More which Ciriaco said has never been displayed in public before.

The saint was a key counselor to King Henry VIII but the king had him executed for standing firm in his Catholic faith. Kent shows him next to his famous words: “I die the king’s good servant and God’s first.” And he points to a cross.

Kent was inspired by Andy Warhol’s famed “Campbell’s Soup Cans” to create prints of everyday objects like Wonder Bread. Other subjects include the Vietnam war as well as an homage to St. John XXIII and President John F. Kennedy.

With the exhibit Ciriaco said he hopes seminarians priests “and all people” will discover “the beauty of God in art and in the common everyday things in life” and “connect them to the Gospel we preach and live.”

He had never seen so many lights.

""I thought: 'Truly anything and everything is possible.'""

As he looks around StepChld his nearly year-old restaurant in northeast Minneapolis opened during the height of the global pandemic the awe he felt as a child is still intact.

""This has exceeded my imagination"" he said. ""And I have a wild imagination.""

When approached to turn the space at 24 University Av. NE. into a restaurant Mohamed barely halted at the obvious challenge: He had never worked in the restaurant industry before.

Excelling in business school with dreams of working in corporate America Mohamed was flummoxed by his terrible luck landing a job in corporate America.

A hiring manager at General Mills gave him this feedback: ""We're the Navy and you're that man who wants to be on a fast boat.""

Mohamed thinks that guidance may have been right.

He started the Uptown Food Truck Festival eventually so successful that he sold the brand. So he decided to try his luck in San Francisco taking his senior project invention — JuiceBot the world's first robotic fresh juice dispenser — on the startup road.

His business partners shared a tiny studio apartment— Mohamed slept in the closet—and took Uber driving shifts to help get JuiceBot launched.

Mohamed said one of his partners picked up Twitter founder Jack Dorsey in his Uber and pitched the idea. Soon a JuiceBot was in a cafeteria at Amazon he said.

But eventually Mohamed needed to be closer to family in Minnesota. He sold JuiceBot and the chance to open a restaurant arrived.

Mohamed believes he can apply the same ""disruptive model"" of JuiceBot to the restaurant world.

StepChld runs on a ""flat hierarchy."" There are no chefs. Mohamed thinks of a dish brings it to the team and they collectively tweak it and work it out until they land on something. While he's bringing subtle Ethiopian stylings to the table — mitmita-spiced aioli on the burger berbere in the birria wagyu and sugo meatballs—everybody gets to chime in.

""No one owns a good idea"" Mohamed said. ""[Traditional] restaurants run like the Navy—you're running a brigade system but you're running a brigade system with pirates. You have very eclectic personalities and you're trying to conform them.

""But here I don't want to build a place. I want to build people. And the people are the investors the electricians all of the people.""

When veteran server Laney Dunn started working at StepChld she told Mohamed that a lot of people in the restaurant industry are toxic.

""He said 'They're mean to each other? Why?'""

Mohamed and his team aim to take such notions and invert them.

At StepChld the proof is in the positive attitude and good vibes easily felt in the bold Ethiopian-around-the-edges menu and in the diverse crowd.

""There is something very experimental about this restaurant"" Mohamed said.

For starters?

""Everyone should feel respected and heard"" he said. ""If that's not going to be the case I don't want a restaurant.""

That's the ethos from which everything flows at StepChld.

Brian Bogan Mohamed's childhood mentor at the Brian Coyle Center said that the young man was as much a mentor to him.

""When all the kids were acting up Kamal was not"" he said. ""In school he started a competition of who can get the highest grade … His heart is in the right place. The man is destined for greatness. I love him.""

The restaurant tells its own story. There's no ""i"" in the name because Mohamed said no one person makes something good. But ""Stepchld"" also serves to remind the restaurant's team and its diners that they should take nothing for granted.

""It's never the origin you think it is"" Mohamed said of his dishes recalling a trip to Italy and seeing pasta with sugo on the menu a dish common in Ethiopia.

""I said 'How do you have sugo?' And the man politely explained to me that his country almost colonized Ethiopia"" he said.

While Mohamed knows that such melding abounds in food culture he remains inspired and energized by it.

""It's familiar but borrowed"" he said. ""You have to respect where it came from but the more adoption there is of something the more it will live on. It's like language. It's important for survival.""

Surprisingly the automaker announced the drastic corporate decision in the Latin country’s media reporting that it will end Mexican production of Chevrolet‘s most modern subcompact car in the middle of this year.

The head of GM Mexico’s communications department stated that the Chevy Onix will stop being built at the Mexican plant in May as part of a new manufacturing strategy at the facility – where the company’s crossovers are also manufactured – namely the Chevy Equinox and GMC Terrain. However the Onix will continue to be sold in that country with units imported from China.

“This vehicle [Chevy Onix] will continue to be sold in our market Mexico and Latin America” said Director of Communications and Public Relations of GM Mexico Teresa Cid in a statement. “GM has the capacity and flexibility to produce its vehicles at any of its plants around the world so it periodically reviews its plans to determine what best suits its manufacturing strategy in order to meet market demand” she added.

GM will end Chevy Onix production in Mexico after a short and turbulent period of local manufacturing. The second-generation Onix began to be built at the San Luis Potosí plant in December 2019 with the projection of being the company’s highest-volume vehicle in the Mexican market but just as the plan started it was severely affected by the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020.

Chevy Onix production in the Latin country faced multiple setbacks such as the forced closings of the plant and the global shortage of semiconductors that never allowed it to prosper as GM had planned. In fact systemic difficulties in the supply chain caused this industrial adjustment that concentrates Onix manufacturing in China as well as in Brazil – where vehicle assembly will once again be temporarily halted.

It should be noted that the Chevy Onix sedan is the only car that the company currently builds in Mexico so its imminent exit from the production lines will make GM’s Mexican subsidiary an exclusive manufacturer of crossovers and trucks. After two and a half years of local manufacturing the Onix units for the Mexican market will be assembled at the GM Dong Yue plant in the Chinese city of Yantai.

General Motors is shifting into high gear with its electrification plans to bring 30 new electric vehicles to market by 2025. The latest offering from luxury brand Cadillac is its first all-electric vehicle – the 2023 Lyriq mid-size SUV.

GM unveiled the car virtually in Detroit in April and this week brought a pre-production model to Toronto to show off to a small group of journalists. It is the second time the car has made a trip to Canada. The first was for a photo shoot with tennis star Bianca Andreescu. The Lyriq which is built in Tennessee will arrive at Canadian dealerships this fall.

“Lyriq is first and foremost a Cadillac and will appeal to any customer looking for a luxury SUV and it will be competitively priced” said Jamie Dewhurst national marketing and communications manager at Cadillac Canada. Starting at $69898 the Lyriq costs about $6000 less than a Tesla Model Y but approximately $10000 more than an Audi Q4 e-tron and Volvo XC40 Recharge.

The display model which wasn’t available to drive is the Lyriq Debut Edition and is only available in rear-wheel-drive. An all-wheel-drive version is expected to be offered by the end of 2022. The Lyriq uses GM’s new Ultium battery technology which is less expensive more powerful and uses less cobalt than batteries used in the Chevrolet Bolt. A 12-module 100 kilowatt-hour battery pack and a single-motor rear-wheel-drive propulsion system produce 340 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque with a range of approximately 480 kilometres. Using a Level two charger or 240-volt outlet it’ll take between 6 -10 hours to fully charge. On a DC fast charger it can reach 122 kilometres in 10 minutes.

At first sight the Lyriq retains some of Cadillac’s distinct and bold family features. It has sharp lines and angles optional 22-inch split-spoke alloy wheels in a polished and gloss black finish and several Cadillac crest emblems. But this is no ordinary Cadillac – its electrification is embossed in its lighting. Approach the vehicle with the key fob and the Lyriq comes to life in a symphony of choregraphed lighting that starts in the front with the Cadillac crest in the centre extends outward to the slim vertical LED headlamps and then to the rear of the vehicle. It takes about 15 seconds to complete the lighting show and is a marvel to watch. Inside the driver’s seat mirrors and temperature adjust to the driver’s preferred settings while the lighting sequence takes place.

As expected of Cadillac the interior doesn’t disappoint. It is upscale with high-quality materials and details such as intricate laser-etched patterns on the dark-ash wood and a jewelry-like drawer lined in juniper blue for storing smaller items like cellphones and wallets. A traditional start-stop button and horizontal piano key buttons for the heating and ventilation system are positioned within arm’s reach.

A massive 33-inch-diagonal LED display stretches across the dashboard angled toward the driver for better visibility. Because this is a pre-production model the screens weren’t working. It would have been useful to see the resolution and graphic quality on the navigation and entertainment systems.

A huge fixed panoramic roof makes it feel airy inside especially in the rear seats. The rear seats recline and fold down for extra cargo-carrying capacity. There’s ample head- and legroom for passengers up to six-feet tall. The front seats are comfortable and eight-way power adjustable with four-way power lumbar heat ventilation and massage functions. The front seats also have headrest speakers – part of the AKG 19-speaker audio system. The Lyriq is also filled with technology including built-in Google assistant over-the-air software updates adaptive cruise control advanced parking assist and Super Cruise GM’s semi-autonomous hands-free driver assistance system. It also has one-pedal driving and a left paddle shifter to maximize efficiency. The pressure-sensitive shifter offers regenerative braking on demand to help the driver control how quickly the vehicle slows or stops.

Unlike many electric vehicles there’s no front trunk. But the rear truck is large and similar in size to the Cadillac XT5. Behind the rear seats there’s 793 litres of cargo space; 1723 litres with the rear seats folded down. Buttons in the cargo area also allow you to fold the rear seats without any heavy or awkward lifting. Plastered on the right side of the hands-free liftgate is the “450E” moniker – 450 for the approximate newton metres of torque and E for electric. On the left side is Lyriq. The name and spelling are unusual but meaningful. It’s a nod to Cadillac’s rich connection to the arts especially music. Cadillac has appeared in more than 3000 song lyrics ranging from artists as diverse as Aretha Franklin and Rihanna.

According to both the companies we could see the new non-pneumatic tyre in a production electric vehicle (EV) in the next three to five years on a new-generation Chevrolet Bolt.

‘Uptis’ stands for ‘Unique Punctureproof Tire System’ highlighting the tyre’s primary advantage its blowout-proof construction which requires no air. The airless tyre is also claimed to have a longer service life – it’s less likely to give up even after multiple punctures or sudden blowouts.

That’s the airless tyre’s environmental advantage – fewer tyres will be scrapped before the end of their service life. Michelin also claims that the new airless tyres are safer since they don’t have any risk of flat tyres or sudden dangerous blowouts.

Michelin’s airless tyre is already being tested on GM vehicles such as the current-generation Chevrolet Bolt electric hatchback from 2019. GM hasn’t confirmed the next-generation Bolt hatchback but a recent quote from the president of Michelin North America Alexis Garcin hints at a future GM compact EV that’ll be equipped with the new airless tyres.

Also read:

Traditional pneumatic (air-filled) tyres have been in use since before the 1850s and carmakers have always engineered suspension models according to air-filled tyre designs. Michelin’s new airless tyres will likely be precisely engineered and fine-tuned for GM models to ensure that the ride and handling experience is familiar for end users.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMi8wMi9nbS1zdXZzLWFuZC10cnVja3Mtc2hvdWxkLW9mZmVyLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLWRhdGEtYW5kLXZpZGVvLXJlY29yZGVyLW9waW5pb24v0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly9nbWF1dGhvcml0eS5jb20vYmxvZy8yMDIyLzAyL2dtLXN1dnMtYW5kLXRydWNrcy1zaG91bGQtb2ZmZXItcGVyZm9ybWFuY2UtZGF0YS1hbmQtdmlkZW8tcmVjb3JkZXItb3Bpbmlvbi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM SUVs And Trucks Should Offer Performance Data And Video Recorder: Opinion,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://gmauthority.com/blog/2022/02/gm-suvs-and-trucks-should-offer-performance-data-and-video-recorder-opinion/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vZ21hdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMjAyMi8wMi9nbS1zdXZzLWFuZC10cnVja3Mtc2hvdWxkLW9mZmVyLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLWRhdGEtYW5kLXZpZGVvLXJlY29yZGVyLW9waW5pb24v0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly9nbWF1dGhvcml0eS5jb20vYmxvZy8yMDIyLzAyL2dtLXN1dnMtYW5kLXRydWNrcy1zaG91bGQtb2ZmZXItcGVyZm9ybWFuY2UtZGF0YS1hbmQtdmlkZW8tcmVjb3JkZXItb3Bpbmlvbi9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

After missing the celebrations last year due to lockdown restrictions this year’s festival was themed “Together Again”.

The first pride parade was held by anti-apartheid activist Simon Nkoli in 1990 and this year is Pride’s 32nd anniversary. The event celebrates the city’s LGBTQI+ community and creates awareness on issues. The parade started at Alfred Street then moved to Green Point Main Road before heading to Green Point track where a concert was hosted. The line-up included local talent Zoe Zana Maxine Wild and Manila von Teez.

The Pride parade was led by the Cape Town Pride 2022 pageant winners followed by a fleet of vehicles from Cape Sidecar Adventures. Mandy Bayley-Blum said it was amazing to be part of the festivities. “It’s fantastic to be out celebrating the gay community. I came out 12 years ago and I’ve never looked back” she said.

Cape Town Pride First Prince Garth Arnold and Miss Cape Town Pride Laylah Zokufa strutted their stuff at the Cape Town Pride parade. Picture - Tracey Adams/African News Agency (ANA) Miss Cape Town Pride 2022 Laylah Zokufa wore a blue pink and yellow leotard with a cape and a diamanté strapped heel. Zokufa said as a small-town girl from Wellington being able to celebrate Pride was a privilege. “After all the years of not fitting in where I come from here I am with people who understand me and that are aligned with me in life” she said.

She added: “Pride to me means being confident in myself who I am and not having to pretend.” The DA attended the festivities dressed in custom-made blue T-shirts where the pride flag was spread throughout their logo. However their presence was frowned upon as revellers believed that the day should not have been a political opportunity.

A Stellenbosch University law student who asked not to be named said it’s sad how the DA was taking the opportunity from vulnerable queer people. “We want to find a political party that resonates with our beliefs and fights for us but it’s sad to know that this is fake and that they’re only doing it for publicity” he said. He added: “They’re milking this. I am not a fan of any of the predominant political parties in South Africa but the DA is the worst.”

Mr Cape Town Pride 2022 Ashwin Williams wore a shorts made out of the colours in the pride flag. Williams said “I am from Robertson and I am proud to show everyone that I am not afraid to be who I am. I am comfortable with myself and want to show it off to everyone.” Cape Town Pride First Prince 2022 Garth Arnolds wore a self-made rose gold sequinned jumpsuit. Arnolds said Pride means family to him.

“This is a day we can come together and celebrate your uniqueness and just be together as one” he said. He added: “It feels amazing to be back. These are people from different walks of life and different genders and we can come together and celebrate.” The teams at Gilead Sciences Fanta and Microsoft also showed up in various pride themed outfits.

Executive director at pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences Christopher Whitfield said their company supports LGBTQI+ communities all around the world. “We’re trying to make sure we build allies so that diversity is highlighted and important” he said. He added: “Pride means inclusion being happy with you are and supporting everyone whether you are part of the spectrum or cisgender. It’s important that with everything happening in the world that the community can still support each other.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

But together with the US and the UK the bloc has now decided to take this drastic step in light of Russia's war in Ukraine.

On Saturday the US the UK and the European Union decided to shut out ""selected"" Russian banks from the international SWIFT payments system after strong initial resistance especially from Germany. The latter feared such a move could harm its own economy enormously because of payments for Russian gas and oil being processed through SWIFT. In the end international pressure finally saw the German government give up its reservations.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba didn't mince his words earlier last week in calling out the European Union for dragging its feet on shutting Russia out of SWIFT.

""Everyone who now doubts whether Russia should be banned from SWIFT has to understand that the blood of innocent Ukrainian men women and children will be on their hands too"" Kuleba wrote on Twitter.

Many others including several leaders from within the EU had shared Kuleba's sentiment that Russia should be cut off from the international payments system in response to President Vladimir Putin's war against Ukraine.

What is SWIFT?

SWIFT or the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication is a secure global messaging network that banks use to make cross-border payments. The network facilitates financial institutions to wire money to each other helping ensure that global trade carries on smoothly.

It is used by more than 11000 financial institutions in over 200 countries and territories to send secure payment orders. Nearly 40 million messages with instructions to transfer trillions of dollars were sent each day in 2020 over the platform making it the most important payment messaging network in the world by far.

Because the messages sent over the platform are deemed secure it helps banks honor the payment instructions swiftly. This ensures that financial institutions can handle high volumes of transactions every day.

The Belgium-based society founded in 1973 is overseen by central banks in Europe the United States Canada and Japan.

What will the agreed ban mean for Russia?

Cutting off Russia from the network will cause a major disruption to its economy as it would severely restrict the country's access to global financial markets.

The ban will make it difficult for Russian firms and individuals to pay for imported goods or receive payments for their exports dealing a major blow to the country's crucial oil and gas sector which relies heavily on SWIFT for the movement of funds. It will also restrict Russians' ability to invest or borrow overseas.

The booting of Iranian banks from the network in 2012 was partly responsible for a dramatic drop in the country's oil exports.

Russian financial institutions could use other channels such as phones messaging apps or email as alternatives and process payments via banks in countries that have not imposed sanctions. But these alternatives will not be as efficient and secure as SWIFT and could lead to higher costs and a fall in transaction volumes.

Russia has developed its own payment messaging network called SPFS. The system which handles about a fifth of domestic payments underwhelms when it comes to the scale and efficiency that SWIFT offers.

Why did the EU hold back for so long?

The EU economy is more intertwined with Russia's than the US economy is and stands to lose much more if Moscow gets shut out of SWIFT.

Data from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) shows that EU banks hold a major chunk of the nearly $30 billion (€27 billion) in foreign banks' exposure to Russia.

The European Union is Russia's biggest trade partner. About 37% of Russia's imports came from the EU in 2020 and nearly 38% of its exports went to the EU. The bloc relies heavily on Russia for its energy needs and gets more than a third of its gas supply and about a quarter of its oil from the country.

""[A SWIFT ban] is also going to be very bad for Europe because if they can't pay for Russian gas using correspondent banks that use dollars in the middle of the transaction of buying their oil and gas from Russia it's going to create havoc on the gas markets and possibly result in having gas turned off in winter"" Alexandra Vacroux executive director of the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University told DW.

Some EU leaders including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz had justified their initial inaction on the SWIFT ban by suggesting that they were holding back some ammunition for later.

Is SWIFT bound by sanctions?

The society a cooperative of banks describes itself as politically neutral and has resisted calls to boot countries from the network. However SWIFT which is incorporated under Belgian law is bound by Belgian and EU rules which include economic sanctions.

Gottfried Leibbrandt former head of SWIFT told a Financial Times forum in 2021 that although the network is technically independent the United States enjoys effective sanction powers as over 40% of payment flows are in US dollars.

In the past Washington has had countries banned from SWIFT including as recently as 2018 when Iranian banks were banned after the US withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal.

Western allies are preparing sweeping new sanctions against Russia including banishing its key banks from the main global payments system drawing thanks from Ukraine on Sunday as its forces battled advancing Russian troops.

Russia's military pounded several cities with missiles overnight setting an oil terminal ablaze in Vasylkiv southwest of the capital Kyiv the town's mayor said. The blasts sent flames and smoke into the night sky online posts showed.

There were reports of heavy fighting near the northeastern city of Kharkiv where Russian troops blew up a natural gas pipeline a Ukrainian state communications agency said.

""The enemy wants to destroy everything"" said the mayor of Vasylkiv Natalia Balasinovich.

Russian President Vladimir Putin launched what he called a special military operation on Thursday ignoring weeks of Western warnings and saying the ""neo-Nazis"" ruling Ukraine threatened Russia's security - a charge Kyiv and Western governments say is baseless propaganda.

The biggest assault on a European state since World War Two threatens to upend the continent's post-Cold War order.

Reuters witnesses in Kyiv reported occasional blasts and gunfire in the city on Saturday night but it was not clear where this was coming from.

""We have withstood and are successfully repelling enemy attacks. The fighting goes on"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video message from the streets of Kyiv posted on his social media.

A U.S. defence official said Ukraine's forces were putting up ""very determined resistance"" to Russia's air land and sea advance which has sent hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing westwards clogging major highways and railway lines.

The United States and its European partners also said they would impose restrictions on Russia's central bank to limit its ability to support the rouble and finance his war effort.

""We are resolved to continue imposing costs on Russia that will further isolate Russia from the international financial system and our economies"" the Western allies said as they escalated their punitive response.

""We will implement these measures within the coming days"" said a joint statement https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/26/joint-statement-on-further-restrictive-economic-measures from the United States France Germany Canada Italy Britain and the European Commission.

'THANKS TO FRIENDS'

After initially shying away from such a move largely because of concern about the impact on their economies the allies said they committed to ""ensuring that selected Russian banks are removed from the SWIFT messaging system.""

They did not name the banks that would be expelled but an EU diplomat said some 70% of the Russian banking market would be affected.

The decision - which the French finance minister had called a ""financial nuclear weapon"" because of the damage it would inflict on the Russian economy - deals a blow to Russia's trade and makes it harder for its companies to do business.

SWIFT or the ""Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication"" is a secure messaging network that facilitates rapid cross-border payments making it a crucial mechanism for international trade.

The payments system said it was preparing to implement the measures.

Sanctions on Russia's central bank could limit Putin's use of his more than $630 billion in international reserves widely seen as insulating Russia from some economic harm.

The new measures will prevent Russia from ""using its war chest"" said Ursula von der Leyen president of the European Commission the European Union's executive.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmygal said in a Twitter post on Sunday: ""Thanks to our friends ... for the commitment to remove several Russian banks from SWIFT.""

'DETERMINED RESISTANCE'

The Kremlin said its troops were advancing again ""in all directions"" after Putin ordered a pause on Friday. Ukraine's government said there had been no pause.

Particularly in northern Ukraine Russia's forces ""have been frustrated by what they have seen is a very determined resistance"" the U.S. official said without providing evidence.

A Ukrainian presidential adviser said about 3500 Russian soldiers had been killed or wounded. Western officials have said intelligence showed Russia suffering higher casualties than expected.

Russia has not released casualty figures and it was impossible to verify tolls or the precise picture on the ground.

At least 198 Ukrainians including three children have been killed and 1115 people wounded Interfax quoted Ukraine's health ministry as saying.

Interfax later cited the regional administration in Donetsk eastern Ukraine saying 17 civilians had been killed and 73 wounded by Russian shelling. Moscow says it is taking care to avoid civilian sites.

Ukraine a democratic nation of 44 million people won independence from Moscow in 1991 after the fall of the Soviet Union and wants to join NATO and the EU goals Russia opposes.

Putin has said he must eliminate what he calls a serious threat to his country from its smaller neighbour accusing it of genocide against Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine - something Kyiv and its Western allies reject as a lie.

U.N. refugee chief Filippo Grandi said more than 150000 Ukrainian refugees have crossed into Poland Hungary Moldova and Romania.

U.S. President Joe Biden approved the release of up to $350 million worth of weapons from U.S. stocks while Germany in a shift from its long-standing policy of not exporting weapons to war zones said it would send anti-tank weapons and surface-to-air missiles.

THE SERIES

— Nebraska returned to Lincoln this past week with plenty to work on after a disappointing opening weekend against Sam Houston. This week head coach Will Bolt and Husker players were confident that better and more efficient baseball will be played going forward. Husker players this week repeated Bolt’s belief that the opening weekend won’t definie their season.

— The Huskers will have to deal with TCU which is coming off an 11-1 win over Stephen F. Austin on Tuesday night. The Horned Frogs opened last weekend in Scottsdale Arizona picking up wins over San Diego State and Houston while dropping a 7-6 decision to Cal. As a team TCU is hitting .295 with 39 hits six doubles two homers and 32 runs. The Horned Frog pitching has team ERA of 2.62 while allowing 11 runs 10 earned and striking out 42 hitters in 34.1 innings.

— TCU has four hitters batting better than .300 on the season thus far. Tommy Sacco leads the way for the Horned Frogs hitting .533 with three RBIs. Brayden Taylor sits just behing Sacco with a .500 batting average. Freshman Daavid Bishop is batting .429. The Horned Frog starting pitchers were solid on the opening weekend combining for a 1.69 ERA.

— TCU will try to force the issue on the basepaths. Last season they were among the top teams in the country for stealing bases and so far this year have 10 steals on 11 attempts. Elijah Nunez leads the way for the Horned Frogs with six steals already this season.

— One of the few bright spots from last week against Sam Houston was the performance of the Nebraska bullpen. The bullpen was put in tough situations several times on the weekend but that group allowed just 11 runs (six earned) while striking out 21 last weekend across 20.2 innings. Nebraska used 12 different relievers on the weekend with Koty Frank (4.2 innings) and Mason Ornelas (3.0 innings) and Emmett Olson (4.2 innings) getting the bulk of the work.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXItdGVsZWdyYW0uY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9jb2xsZWdlL2JpZy0xMi90ZXhhcy1jaHJpc3RpYW4tdW5pdmVyc2l0eS9hcnRpY2xlMjU4NzQ0MDIzLmh0bWzSAWRodHRwczovL2FtcC5zdGFyLXRlbGVncmFtLmNvbS9zcG9ydHMvY29sbGVnZS9iaWctMTIvdGV4YXMtY2hyaXN0aWFuLXVuaXZlcnNpdHkvYXJ0aWNsZTI1ODc0NDAyMy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TCU baseball appears to have found its ace in left-hander Austin Krob,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.star-telegram.com', port=443): Read timed out.

MLB and the MLBPA have met for five consecutive days this week but a new CBA still has not materialized. The two sides have failed to find common ground on key issues. The league's threat of cancelling regular season games looms large.

Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic provided his take on MLB and the owners' strategy in a pointed article on Thursday.

“But the owners’ strategy from the start was to squeeze the union until regular-season games were in jeopardy all the while recoiling in disgust when the player-serfs rejected their crumbs and refused to view them as benevolent despots.”

MLB's plan has worked the way they wanted it to. Now the players are beyond frustrated with how the owners have approached the CBA negotiations.

Dodgers pitcher Walker Buehler gave his thoughts in a pair of tweets on Thursday that the pitcher has since deleted.

Buehler has since deleted his passionate tweets but it's hard to imagine that Buehler is the only player who had it with MLB owners.

If a new CBA isn't agreed upon by this coming Monday the league is prepared to cancel regular season games.

The competitive balance tax anti-tanking measures and arbitration rules are the major hurdles that must be cleared if Opening Day is going to happen on time.

According to ESPN's Jesse Rogers the league and players will continue to meet throughout the weekend.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbmdsb2JlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAyLzI2L21ldHJvL3RyYXl2b24tbWFydGlucy1ibGFjay1saWZlLW1hdHRlcmVkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Trayvon Martin’s Black life mattered,"Not enough people cared. Not at first. An American ritual.

What I remember most outside of the baby-faced boy who should have made it home that night a decade ago is that there were no charges and no cuffs.

There was no arrest. Not at first.

Trayvon Martin turned 17 on February 5 2012. On February 26 2012 he was killed for being Black.

“If I had a son he’d look like Trayvon” President Obama said from the Rose Garden a month later.

It would be two weeks after Obama lifted his name and several weeks after the homicide that George Zimmerman would be arrested. We had to fight to hashtag to protest. Like what the families of DJ Henry and Oscar Grant did for them before Martin. Before Black Lives Matter began.

Zimmerman followed chased and killed Martin in Florida. He called it self-defense. And he was treated better than a Black 6-year-old who was arrested for throwing a temper tantrum. He was found not guilty on all charges in July 2013 leading to #BlackLivesMatter and the modern movement.

We fight to live and then we fight for our dead. And in the decade since the devastation of Trayvon Martin’s murder we’re not supposed to call a murder we’ve stretched our arms far and wide in ways that seem impossible to mourn the many lives we lost to racism. This is part of our American history that they don’t want in the books.

Still fighting. Two years ago this week Ahmaud Arbery was followed hunted and shot to death. The three white men responsible for lynching the 25-year-old were not arrested for months. Had it not been for a leaked video gone viral there may never have been a trial.

Tuesday a Georgia jury found all three white men who murdered Arbery guilty of a federal hate crime. A rare conviction.

“What I try to tell myself is these institutions and racism is so deeply deeply rooted it’s taken hundreds of years to put these systems in place you can’t change it all in 10 years” said Hodan Hashi co-founder of Black Boston a nonprofit fighting for equity and justice.

Hashi was 13 when Martin was murdered.

“What I took away at that time is no matter what we look like even as children we are seen as threats to society and that’s a lot to come to terms with at 13. We talk about critical race theory racism and slavery and white kids being affected by learning about this but the conversation isn’t being had about how racism affects us as kids” Hashi said.

“ ‘“We talk about critical race theory racism and slavery and white kids being affected by learning about this but the conversation isn’t being had about how racism affects us as kids.”’ Hodan Hashi who was 13 when Trayvon Martin was killed.

“It is kind of the reason why I do everything that I do why we started Black Boston why I have decided to work in politics” she said. “There is a lot of work to be done but how do we do that work so that we are challenging these systems at all times?”

We have to not just dismantle a system but shift a culture that let Zimmerman off and four years later auctioned the gun he used for a quarter of a million dollars.

“When I think of Trayvon I think of how a George Zimmerman gets made. He’s not an individual so much as he is an idea this idea of white people believing their violence is authorized by the state that this is their country they get to act as the state to deputize themselves” said Saida Grundy assistant professor of sociology African-American Studies and women’s and gender studies at Boston University.

Martin in many ways like Emmett Till became the catalyst for a movement to protect Black lives. But with progress comes backlash and even still nothing brings back these children.

“What I really get haunted by is the older we get we understand just how young Trayvon Martin was and we will never know what he could have become because he was denied the chance to grow” Grundy said.

“ ‘“What I really get haunted by is the older we get we understand just how young Trayvon Martin was and we will never know what he could have become because he was denied the chance to grow”’ Saida Grundy

“I think about the trauma done to that family and to a whole community. This isn’t about individuals. This is about sanctioned levels of violence” she said.

Boston City Councilor Ricardo Arroyo was in law school studying to be a public defender when Zimmerman went free.

“Trayvon Martin was murdered and he was put on trial for his own murder. I was infuriated with that” said Arroyo who is running for Suffolk district attorney. “Where have we come where have we gone since Amadou Diallo? The Ahmaud Arbery verdict sentence just came down but people of color having their lives be under threat simply because they are Black and brown — I don’t know that we have made much progress on that.”

Where we have seen change Arroyo said is in civic engagement in dialogue in political power.

“Folks don’t want to hear just thoughts and prayers they want systemic reform. We still have a long way to go but with Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown and Ferguson there was a politicization of a generation” he said.

“ ‘“Folks don’t want to hear just thoughts and prayers. They want systemic reform. We still have a long way to go but with Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown and Ferguson there was a politicization of a generation.”’ Ricardo Arroyo

“We have gotten to a place where the electorate in some cities and states are not going to allow for things we can participate in to do things in our name any longer. We do that through elections” he added.

Trayvon Martin’s mother Sybrina Fulton became a social justice activist with over 20 years of government work experience. She ran for and almost won a seat as a Miami-Dade County Board of County Commissioner in 2020.

Her commitment to a better America is what we see reflected in US Attorney Rachael Rollins Representative Ayanna Pressley and not only Mayor Michelle Wu but many of the workers who have risen to lead in her office.

Stephanie Everett was named executive director of the Office of Police Accountability and Transparency by then-Acting Mayor Kim Janey last April. Wu staffed both that board and the Civilian Review Board earlier this year.

Though Martin was not murdered by the police his killer much like Arbery’s killers tried to evoke the power of the police as we have seen throughout history in the killing of unarmed Black people.

“I believe his murder did bring out the need for us to be vocal. We worry about our children coming home at night. We have to give our children tools to help them get home safely. Our parents gave us those tools. Our grandparents gave them tools” Everett said.

“Other people weren’t given those tools. We are going to get there step by step person by person policy by policy procedure by procedure transparently. It’s going to take all of us to make sure our children do get home.”

But American ritual is to decide whose citizenship matters to police whose lives are worth saving.

A decade after Trayvon Martin was murdered thousands of marches and many dead bodies and we still can’t agree that Black lives matter.

Amir Locke was murdered by Minneapolis police serving a no-knock warrant earlier this month. And when a fight broke out between two teenagers in a New Jersey mall two weeks ago it was the Black boy with police kneeling on his back who was arrested despite the other teen admitting wrongdoing too.

It was this month a Minnesota judge had the audacity to ask us to empathize with Daunte Wright’s murderer former officer Kim Potter as she issued a sentence of two years in his killing. Black people get more time for nonviolent offenses every day.

Somehow to say a Black life is worthy is seen as an insult to any other life. Trayvon Martin’s Black life mattered. Ten years later we still have to say it. Our lives matter.

The 52-year-old admitted to committing fraud to try to marry model Kimora Lee Simmons during an ongoing corruption trial of former Goldman associate Roger Ng on Tuesday.

“I photoshopped the divorce document” he testified in Brooklyn federal court.

Simmons and Leissner were wed in 2014 while he was still legally married to his former spouse Judy Chan reports the New York Post.

Prosecutor Drew Rolle inquired if Chan had any knowledge of the marriage to which he confessed “Judy did not want to make any transfers related to my new family life in Los Angeles” after asking her to help him put a $900000 down payment on a house.

“It didn’t work” he said. “I think she did some research on the Internet and found out I was trying to buy this house.”

Amid the trial it also came out that the former banker additionally falsified another divorce prior to Chan.

The two former bankers were arrested and charged for the Malaysia 1MDB scandal in 2018 a scheme in which Malaysia’s then-Prime Minister Najib Razak funnled about $700 million from the sovereign wealth fund into personal accounts in one of the biggest corruption and money laundering scandals in the world.

While Leissner has pleaded guilty to aiding the fraud mastermind financier Jho Low to loot hundreds of millions of dollars from the fund Ng maintains his innocence.

Leissner continued to sing in court in exchange for a lighter sentence testifying that he kept $60 million in bribes was watching over $80 million in off-shore shell companies for Low and that one of his many affairs was attempting to blackmail him for a $10 million mansion.

Tim Leissner 52 who pleaded guilty to taking part in Malaysia's 1MDB corruption scandal in 2018 told prosecutors at Goldman Sachs colleague Roger Ng's trial on Thursday that he was twice married to two women at the same time Bloomberg reported.

Leissner said he faked divorce documents to marry Simmons 46 in 2014 while he was still married to Judy Chan a former analyst at Goldman and the daughter of a coal-mining business owner in China.

'I photoshopped the divorce document' Leissner told the courtroom.

He added that when he and Chan tied the knot in 2000 he was married to another woman who has not been identified and submitted fake records to the Hong Kong government to finalize their marriage.

The vague details of Tim Leissner's marriage history Tim Leissner was accused of bigamy during Roger Ng's money laundering trial. The accusation has prompted questions about the banker's vaguely detailed personal life. The former Goldman Sachs employee is currently married to model Kimora Lee Simmons. The pair had a secret wedding. The exact date and location of that ceremony remains unknown as a marital records search did not yield any results. The couple was however pictured in Saint Barthélemy in December 2013 sporting rings on their left hands. Page Six alleged they may have had a Caribbean wedding during that time. Leissner and Kimora Lee Simmons share a son Wolfe who was born in 2015. They also adopted Gary then 10 in January 2020. The couple has since become estranged although it is unclear when they split. While marrying Kimora Lee Simmons Leissner was married to Judy Chan who currently runs Grace Vineyard China's first family-owned winery. Chan and Leissner met at Goldman when she was working as a junior analyst. It is unclear when exactly they got married but Bloomberg Quint reported that the feast 'included suckling pigs with electric lights flashing in their eye sockets.' Reports had suggested Chan and Leissner divorced in 2013 but Leissner revealed he was still married to Chan when he tied the knot with Simmons. Chan was using her married name in Grace Vineyard promotional materials in 2012. She appears to have begun using her maiden name in 2013. Information regarding his alleged first wife's identity was not disclosed but Leissner said he was still married to her when he married Chen in 2000.

Leissner said that Simmons was not aware of his actions back then but that Chan was saying that she was angered by it and refused to transfer $900000 to his account so he could put a down payment on a new home for him and Simmons in Los Angeles.

'Judy did not want to make any transfers related to my new family life in Los Angeles' Leissner testified. 'I think she did some research on the Internet and found out I was trying to buy this house.'

Leissner had met Simmons who was previously married to hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons in business class on a flight from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur.

The couple reportedly exchanged vows in 2013 - around the time his relationship with Chan fell apart - and had a son Wolfe who was born in 2015. They also adopted Gary then 10 in January 2020.

The revelations came as Leissner was called to testify this week against Ng Goldman's former head of investment banking in Malaysia who is charged with conspiring to launder money and to violate an anti-bribery law.

Leissner agreed to cooperate with the government's investigation and testify against his former associate for a reduced sentence forfeiting $43 million.

Prosecutors said that Ng 49 received $35 million in kickbacks for helping embezzle $4.5 billion in funds from 1MDB in a 'brazen' scam.

The pair allegedly worked with Malaysian financier Jho Low to divert the money to fund their lavish lifestyle.

NG has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Thursday's testimony also was the latest look into Leissner's personal life after Ng's defense attorney claimed the ex banker was a 'double bigamist' who 'uses women.'

Earlier this week Leissner admitted that he had a decade-long affair with Rohana Rozhan MEASAT Broadcast executive and former CEO of Astro Malaysia Holdings.

Leissner testified that Rozhan threatened to reveal his involvement in Ng's alleged $4.5 billion scheme with the Malaysian government to embezzle money from the 1MDB account in 2013 if he did not siphon $10 million from the fund to buy her a London home Bloomberg reported.

'Ms. Rozhan was very upset that I was ending our relationship to be with my future wife with Kimora' Leissner told prosecutors referring to his estranged wife model and reality TV star Kimora Lee Simmons 46.

'If I didn't buy her a house she would tell the authorities about my involvement in the 1MDB scandal. She was threatening to expose me. At the time 2013 I was very fearful of that.'

Leissner added that he informed his then-boss Richard Gnodde head of Goldman Sachs' Asia business about his relationship with Rozhan Bloomberg reported.

Gnodde had allegedly told Leissner to 'be careful about relationships with clients' as Astro was one of the businesses Goldman Sachs was working with in Malaysia.

Leissner said their relationship which spanned from 2003 to 2013 was an open secret.

'Pretty much everybody in our Southeast Asia territory knew it' he testified.

Rozhan who resigned from Astro in 2019 could not be immediately reached for comment.

Goldman Sachs declined to comment on Leissner's testimony.

Rozhan has a London address listed under her name at 42 Montpelier Street (pictured). It is currently unknown if this is the home Leissner paid $10 million for

During his fourth day of testimony on Thursday Leissner also admitted to pocketing nearly half the $162 million entrusted to him by Low through the 1MBD and borrowing another $1.25 million from Ng that he never returned Bloomberg reported.

He added that he stole from Low to buy a $50 million boat part of the Inter Milan soccer team and a Manhattan apartment at 68th Street and Madison Avenue.

Leissner also revealed that he and Ng tried to set up jobs at Goldman Sachs for three children of former Malaysian' prime minister Najib Razak who was ousted in 2018 for his alleged involvement in the 1MBD scandal.

Leissner told prosecutors that in 2009 Razak spoke with the Goldman Sachs bankers along with then CEO- Lloyd Blankfein at the Four Seasons hotel in New York asking them to help find positions for three of his five children at the company Bloomberg reported.

Leissner did not name which of Razak's kids were part of the proposed deal only that one daughter had eventually gotten a job at TPS Inc. suggesting it was Nooryana Najwa Najib who was hired at the company in 2014.

In total Goldman Sachs will have to pay out more than $5 billion in fines in the scandal in which former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak (above) and his cronies looted billions from 1Malaysia Development Berhad a supposed government investment fund. Leissner said Razak had requested Goldman Sachs hire three of his fire children

Billions of dollars were looted from the sovereign wealth fund in a fraud that allegedly involved former prime minister Najib Razak and his associates

Leissner added that Low was involved in the attempts to get Razak's children hired as he read an email between him and Ng in the courtroom on Tuesday.

'Just met PM's three children with Jho at his apartment' Leissner read from the message he allegedly received from Ng. 'We'll work on getting them to join GS.'

Leissner replied to Ng: 'Sounds good my friend. Get them in.'

He said they passed along a daughter's resume to Goldman Sachs' office in London but a company official rejected their request for the daughter to be hired.

'He basically told me he would not support this so we dropped it' Leissner told prosecutors.

He also told the court that he and Ng came up with the codenames 'Friend' and 'PMO' which referred to the Prime Minister's Office for Low as they worked to secure Goldman Sachs' ties in Malaysia and the 1MBD account.

Leissner said Low was 'essential' to their business because he was a 'key decision-maker' in advising Razak and had fed Goldman bankers insider information on how the government was choosing who it would partner with on the 1MBD Bloomberg reported.

Goldman was competing with JPMorgan Chase UBS and other major banks for business with the Malaysian government.

Prosecutor Drew Rolle asked Leissner if their information from Low was 'like having the answers to a test ahead of time.'

'Yes' Leissner said. 'Because we wrote them.'

The pair allegedly worked with Malaysian financier Jho Low (pictured) to divert the money to fund their lavish lifestyle

'Roger is 100% innocent' defense attorney Marc Agnifilo told the jury. 'We're about to actually have a trial of an innocent man.'

The defense argued Ng's only role was introducing Low to 'far more involved' superiors at Goldman who escaped prosecution. The attorney also claimed his client warned company management not to trust Low.

Among the purchases made from the record heist were a vast superyacht called Equanimity jewels and even financing for the hit 2013 movie The Wolf of Wall Street starring Leonardo DiCaprio.

Agnifilo told jurors Leissner should not be trusted claiming the witness secretly recorded co-conspirators in the scheme but he never found anything incriminating about his client Ng.

Federal prosecutor Brent Wible alleges Ng secretly agreed with Leissner and Low to take hundreds of millions of dollars raised for three bond deals tied to 1MDB that had been intended for development projects in Malaysia.

Low the accused mastermind behind the scheme was indicted in the US alongside Ng in 2018.

He has not been arrested by US or Malaysian authorities and his US lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.

Prosecutors say Goldman earned $600 million in fees from the deals and that around $4.5billion of the funds raised was embezzled.

Goldman paid a nearly $3billion fine and arranged for its Malaysian subsidiary to plead guilty in US court.

Leissner said on the stand Wednesday that Ng was Goldman's lead banker on 1MDB and had cultivated a relationship with Malaysian financier Jho Low starting in 2008 who was the key intermediary between the bank and 1MDB.

Bringing in 1MDB business to Goldman which ultimately sold $6.5 billion in bonds for the fund and reaped $600 million in fees 'instantaneously made us heroes' within the bank Leissner said.

'My greed and ambition took over' Leissner said adding that the fallout from his actions had destroyed his life.

Malaysian socialite Jho Low (right) - the other key player in the scheme - remains at large and is believed to have been granted asylum abroad. In 2012 he threw a lavish 31st birthday bash attended by DiCaprio (left) Kim Kardashian and other celebrities. Low and DiCaprio are pictured at The Wolf of Wall Street World Premiere in Paris in December 2013

He also said bankers at Goldman were expected to be hired on every one of their clients' deals and that missing one was considered 'unacceptable.'

Agnifilo has countered that Leissner who has not yet been sentenced has lied to prosecutors about Ng's involvement in a bid to lighten his punishment.

He spent much of his opening statement attacking Leissner's credibility portraying him as a socialite with expensive taste.

Low who maintains his innocence became well known in the New York City and Los Angeles club scenes.

In 2012 he threw a lavish 31st birthday bash attended by DiCaprio Kim Kardashian and other celebrities - a fête described by The Wall Street Journal as the 'wildest party [Las] Vegas ever saw.'

Pop star Britney Spears is said to have jumped out of a birthday cake to serenade Low.

He also dated Miranda Kerr who was forced to surrender $8 million in jewelry he gave her amid the 1MDB inquiry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMizAFodHRwczovL2F0bGFudGFibGFja3N0YXIuY29tLzIwMjIvMDIvMjYvYnV0LXlhbGwtd2VyZS1tYWQtYXQtcnVzc2VsbC1zb2NpYWwtbWVkaWEtcmFpc2VzLWl0cy1leWVicm93cy1hZnRlci1raW1vcmEtbGVlLXNpbW1vbnMtZGlzZ3JhY2VkLWJhbmtlci1odXNiYW5kLXRpbS1sZWlzc25lci10ZWxscy1jb3VydC1oZS1mYWtlZC1oaXMtZGl2b3JjZS1iZWZvci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'But Y'all Were Mad at Russell': Social Media Raises Its Eyebrows After Kimora Lee Simmons' Disgraced Banker ...,"Kimora Lee Simmons’ scandal-filled marriage to Tim Leissner is making headlines once again after the disgraced former Goldman Sach banker said in a New York courtroom this week that he faked a divorce in order to marry the influential fashion designer — and that was the second time he’d used phony divorce papers to get married.

Leissner made the admission during his witness testimony in the federal bribery and money-laundering trial of a former Goldman subordinate Leissner claims he partnered with to rip off hundreds of millions of dollars from Malaysian wealth fund 1MDB. Leissner who already has pleaded guilty for his role in the complex scheme also testified this week that he ripped off tens of millions of dollars from his accomplices in the alleged scheme.

The 52-year-old told prosecutors at Goldman Sachs colleague Roger Ng’s trial on Thursday Feb. 24 that he was twice married to two women simultaneously Bloomberg reported.

Leissner initially forged documents to marry former Goldman Sachs analyst and Chinese coal-mining heir Judy Chan. When the pair wed in 2000 Leissner was still married to another woman whose identity has not been made public so Leissner sent forged divorce papers to the Hong Kong government to clear the path for his and Chan’s nuptials.

By 2014 the German-born investment banker was preparing to marry the Baby Phat creator despite still being married to Chan. On Thursday in court he said “I photoshopped the divorce document” to get around that problem.

When prosecutor Drew Rolle asked Leissner if Chan was aware of the forgery he replied that she was upset and refused to help him put a $900000 down payment on a house in Los Angeles for him and his new bride. “Judy did not want to make any transfers related to my new family life in Los Angeles” he said.

Leissner also claimed that he tried to Get Chan to transfer him the money by claiming that it was for Malaysian financier Jho Low the fugitive who is wanted for his alleged role as the mastermind in the 1MDB scheme. “It didn’t work” he said. “I think she did some research on the Internet and found out I was trying to buy this house.”

Leissner pleaded guilty in 2018 for involvement in the scheme paying nearly $44 million to avoid jail time. Kimora Lee’s ex-husband Def Jam co-founder Russell Simmons claims his ex-wife misappropriated his money to help her husband with his legal troubles.

In May 2021 the music executive sued the mother of his two daughters for allegedly transferring and using his shares in the Celsius’s energy drink company as collateral for Leissner’s bond in his case.

News that Leissner falsified marriage documents prompted critics on social media to refer back to the suit. Many of them appeared to side with the Phat Farm creator including media personality Jacob York who wrote “But y’all were mad at Russell.” Another person commented “So Russ wasn’t lying?”

And of course the jokes came flooding in. “See while she was tryna tell the Kardashians how to handle Jordan this who she should’ve been worried about” wrote a third person. “Damn her box must be hittin to get a man to photoshop divorce papers! It’s Kimora Lee Simmons tho so I totally understand lmaoo” added another.

By Ronni Newton

Cora Cora opened its doors in West Hartford in 2011 transforming a former McDonald’s in the Shield Street Plaza on the southeastern edge of West Hartford into a restaurant whose authentic and vibrant Peruvian cuisine earned it a “good” review in the New York Times.

Now both the restaurant and its chef Macarena Ludena have garnered even more national recognition with the announcement of their inclusion as semifinalists for prestigious James Beard Awards.

Cora Cora is one of 20 restaurants nationwide – and the only establishment in New England – named a semifinalist in the “Outstanding Restaurant” category. Ludena the daughter of Cora Cora founders Hector Ludena and Luisa Jimenez is one of only two Connecticut chefs among the 20 nominated in the “Best Chef: Northeast” category.

Cora Cora’s owners immigrated from Coracora Peru and opened their restaurant at 162 Shield Street in West Hartford 11 years ago developing a loyal customer base with their authentic house-made dishes made from high-quality ingredients including some imported directly from Peru. Chicken is a perennial favorite but Cora Cora’s menu also includes steaks seafood and stir-fried dishes like the Lomo Saltado (strips of tenderloin stir-fried with soy sauce Aji Amarillo onions tomatoes and cilantro served over hand-cut fingerling potatoes with a side of white rice).

The Tallarin Saltado (chicken tenderloin linguine pasta red onion tomato and Aji Amarillo strips sautéed and flambéed with soy sauce) is also a customer favorite.

Macarena Ludena who has worked her way up in the restaurant progressing from busing tables to the dessert station to the ceviche station to manager and now to head chef is among the next generation taking over as the parents take a step back while maintaining the same quality culture and atmosphere for which Cora Cora has become known.

“We strive every day to serve our customers the way we would serve our family – with high-quality ingredients prepared with passion and love” Jimenez said in an announcement of the recognition. “When people come to our restaurant we are dedicated to giving them an experience of community and we want them to feel that we are taking care of them the way we would our own family. To be recognized for this dedication by the James Beard Foundation is a tremendous honor.”

“I am truly honored by the James Beard Award Semifinalist nomination and am grateful to the Cora Cora team for always bringing their best to our customers and to each other” said Ludena. “We prepare every dish seeking to show respect to our Peruvian heritage and gratitude to our American Dream and we are humbled by our customers who have supported us over the last 11 years. Cooking Peruvian food is art a way to transmit love. It’s something that takes me to places of my hometown and special childhood memories and through these flavors I can share it with our customers.”

Cora Cora survived during the pandemic by adapting but not losing the essential sense of hospitality they had cultivated. They transitioned to takeout immediately and were able to utilize their drive-through window – a relic of the former McDonald’s that had preceded them in the space. They opened outdoor seating and reopened the dining room at limited capacity expanding seating as permitted.

The dining room’s iconic stuffed llama has helped set a good example for diners wearing a mask when required.

They expanded their social media profile and took advantage of programs offered by the Town of West Hartford one of the owners said in a previous interview.

“The James Beard Awards considered to be among the nation’s most prestigious honors recognize exceptional talent in the culinary and food media industries as well as a demonstrated commitment to racial and gender equity community sustainability and a culture where all can thrive” the announcement states.

Winners will be celebrated on June 13 2022 at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. For more information about the James Beard Awards including a list of semifinalists visit their website.

Oak View Group which manages 300 sports and entertainment venues globally and redevelops others said it is “very likely” the Los Angeles-based company would invest in a renovation of the aging Hartford arena.

A financial commitment would bring private investment to the table sought by Gov. Ned Lamont as a way to ease the burden on state taxpayers.

“We’re looking at this with an eye toward a public-private partnership” Peter Luukko chairman of OVG Facilities said. “We’re more than willing to put our own funds into this renovation.”

Luukko said OVG has not yet determined how much it would invest because a study of the scope of renovations must be updated. Details of a partnership with the state also would have to be negotiated Luukko said.

“We believe the facility has the bones” Luukko said. “It’s dated and if we could restore it it could become an incredibly active facility as it was many years ago.”

Two years ago the legislature approved $65 million for a major renovation of Hartford’s XL Center. Gov. Ned Lamont has not brought the funding to the State Bond Commission because he wanted to see private investment in the project.

Luukko said OVG is involved with the redevelopment of an even older arena in Baltimore and another just outside of Toronto.

Michael W. Freimuth executive director of the Capital Region Development Authority which oversees the XL Center’s operations said an OVG commitment would be a major step forward after two years that included shutdowns during the pandemic.

“It’s someone saying they are willing to invest in the building too” Freimuth said.

The long debate

The future of the 47-year-old arena in the heart of downtown Hartford has been debated for more than a decade.

Supporters say it is a vital amenity for fostering downtown’s revitalization and its ecosystem of restaurants and bars. The XL Center they say is an attraction for the region. Critics argue the state should not keep pouring money into a venue that historically has lost money typically $2 million a year.

A $250 million plan for a massive top-to-bottom makeover failed to gain traction with legislators. Two years ago the vision was slimmed down to $100 million. CRDA argues a major renovation is needed to put the arena on the path to profitability and keep it competitive in the industry.

Pressure to move forward with some plan flared up in recent weeks as the University of Connecticut negotiates what is expected to be a one-year lease extension at the XL Center arena. UConn men’s and women’s basketball and men’s ice hockey play roughly 30 games a year.

Some local sports pundits argued a decision about an XL renovation should be made or it would be better for UConn to play in Storrs.

In a statement UConn said it hoped to reach an agreement that is beneficial to both sides for playing in downtown Hartford.

“It is obvious that the XL Center is overdue for a major renovation” the statement said. “Tuesday’s game against Villanova displayed that building can provide a fantastic atmosphere but many of the off-campus venues our peers are competing in are NBA or NBA-level facilities.”

UConn fans swarmed the court after the Huskies upset Villanova 71-69 at the XL Center on Tuesday.

“Our basketball programs deserved to be housed in facilities that are considered among the best in the Big East” the statement said.

UConn said it is obviously more convenient for its students to watch games on campus — Gampel Pavilion for basketball — and are key supporters and create a “high-energy environment on game day.

But UConn also said students are just one part of the equation.

“The XL Center provides a more convenient commute to many of our fans from around the state simply by the nature of its centralized location than campus” the statement said. “That convenience along with the building’s capacity translates into larger crowds being able to watch the Huskies in action.”

OVG’s Luukko said UConn playing at the XL Center — and the fact that UConn sports are so ingrained is the state’s culture — plus having the AHL’s Wolf Pack was an extremely strong base to build on.

Public-private partnership

The $65 million approved by the legislature is key to the $100 million renovation and was supported by Lamont. But Lamont said the funding — raised through the sale of bonds — was contingent on private investment.

“The governor always prefers public-private partnerships when available and this is no exception” Max Reiss a Lamont spokesman said in a text.

The last major renovation of the XL Center was in 2014 at a state taxpayer-cost of $35 million. The project added a fan club and loge premium seating and made improvements to the concourse and restrooms.

A $100 million downsized renovation plan for Hartford’s aging XL Center eliminated a second concourse and would expand the existing one into the atrium off Trumbull Street easing congestion.

The work was intended to carry the arena through perhaps a decade or so until the decision was made to either do something bigger so the XL Center would remain competitive or let it wind down.

The $65 million would come on top of $40 million bonded in 2017 for repairs and to attract a private investor or buyer which drew little interest. The funds in 2017 also were intended for purchasing the privately owned atrium off Trumbull Street to expand the concourse.

About half of the $40 million has been spent replacing the arena floor installing a new ice rink and ice-making system and repairing elevators and escalators work that couldn’t wait for a larger renovation.

CRDA plans more improvements this summer that could dovetail with a larger renovation. Those include the addition of a sportsbook expanded locker rooms and replacement of retractable seating.

Overall the $100 million plan focuses on the lower half of the arena adding more premium seating and concessions all intended to bring in more revenue Freimuth has said.

OVG took over management of the XL Center about six months ago after acquiring Spectra the previous manager. OVG kept local personnel in place who have knowledge of the market Luukko said.

A sports betting venue could open at Hartford’s XL Center this fall in time for the thick of the football season. A rendering shows how the 4000-square-foot venue might look.

Luukko said he also spent large parts of his career in Connecticut — parts of it involved with the XL Center formerly the Hartford Civic Center — and resides 35 miles away in Essex.

“We’ve got a head start because we know the market and the arena itself” Luukko said.

Paige Bueckers the defending player of the year for several institutions took to the Connecticut court for the first time since Dec. 5 putting in eight points on 4-of-5 shooting from the field. It was part of a tremendous offensive output for the hosting Huskies paced by Azzi Fudd’s 19 (7-of-9 5-of-7 from three-point range) who crushed St. John’s by a 93-38 final at XL Center. Connecticut shot 64 percent from the field (40-of-63) and led by as much as 58.

With Bueckers back in the lineup No. 7 UConn (21-5 15-1 Big East) had a full roster arsenal to work with with the exception of Aubrey Griffin who has already been ruled out for the remainder of the season. Bueckers’ sophomore season has been mostly erased by surgeries to repair both a knee injury and a meniscus tear. She played a dozen minutes off the bench in her return adding two rebounds and an assist in that effort.

By the time Bueckers was ready to make her entry the game was firmly locked in the Huskies’ favor after jumping out to a 17-0 lead by the midway mark of the first quarter. The early sealing was secured when Fudd and Nika Muhl sank each of the team’s first three-point attempts (Fudd hitting two en route to her team-best tally in scoring).

With the game already well in hand the only drama left was exactly when Bueckers would make her entry. Her rearrival came with 3:41 remaining in the first half as part of a mostly wholesale change that also saw Dorka Juhasz and Evina Westbrook play the first minutes of their Hartford finales. Bueckers picked up a rebound off a Juhasz blocked that led to Fudd’s fastbreak triple before capping off the opening frame with a buzzer-beating jumper that created a 30-8 lead and sent the arena into hysterics.

That Bueckers crowdpleaser was part of another 17-0 run over the early quarters allowing the Huskies to coast the rest of the way. Though they fell three points short of winning by their largest margin of the night the 55-point difference was the Huskies' most one-sided effort of the 2021-22 season. With Fudd leading the way five UConn representatives reached double figures: Aaliyah Edwards needed only 19 minutes to score 16 points and pull down seven rebounds while Olivia Nelson-Ododa and Christyn Williams scored 13 each in their final Hartford showings. Future XL Center staple Caroline Ducharme matched the seniors with 13 of her own while Westbrook assisted on 10 of the baskets in another farewell to New England’s Rising Star.

A solid streak for St. John’s (11-17 7-11 Big East) ended with a thud as the Red Storm sank only 14-of-53 from the field (26 percent). No Red Storm representative reached double-figures

despite the team entering as victors in four of their last five. Kadaja Bailey and Camree Clegg led the metropolitan visitors with nine each in defeat.

UConn will end its 2021-22 regular season on Sunday afternoon as Senior Day ceremonies will be held prior to Providence’s visit (2 p.m. ET CBSSN). The Friars (11-17 6-13 Big East) have lost eight of their last ten including a 69-61 defeat at the hands of the Huskies on Jan. 30 in Rhode Island.

Filmmaker Michael Bay appears to be ready to move on to other exploding pastures now that he has completed his Transformers Series. Since Paramount and Hasbro want to keep the fire going on one of their largest moneymakers two crucial considerations lay ahead: when to release the next movie and who should direct it.

Who can fill Bay’s high-priced illogical shoes? Someone who can manage a large budget and even larger special effects is required. It’s not enough to make something explode. You must comprehend how to accomplish it correctly. After the jump you can see our picks for six directors who could handle Optimus Prime and Friends.

5. Joe Johnston

Johnston is a bit of a journeyman filmmaker and he’s been asked to take over a film or a franchise twice in his career. In 2001 he took over the Jurassic Park franchise from Steven Spielberg (who also serves as an executive producer on the Transformers movie) and Johnston was called in at the last minute to replace Mark Romanek on The Wolfman. Captain America like Transformers is based at Paramount and the studio may seek to keep him in-house while delegating control of the Transformers property to him.

4. Jon Turteltaub

Turteltaub like other filmmakers on this list has a strong creative vision but he can successfully put together an action film which is exactly what Hasbro and Paramount want. They want a person who won’t cause a stir will cheerfully include as many robots as required to help Hasbro sell more toys and won’t stray too far from the formula that has made Transformers one of the most popular brands of all time.

3. Stephen Sommers

This is a bit of a long shot because Sommers and Paramount didn’t appear to get along after G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. He was rumored to have been shut out of the editing room and he later decided not to return for G.I. Joe 2. But the reality remains that Sommers’ forte is big stupid action and he’s previously created a CGI-heavy blockbuster feature based on a Hasbro line of action figures.

2. Louis Leterrier

Leterrier had his eye on The Avengers after the success of Clash of the Titans but he didn’t receive the job. His work in Brian K. Vaughan’s Y: The Last Man and the magician heist thriller Now You See Me is commendable. However if Paramount swooped in and offered him Transformers Franchise it might potentially take first place on his agenda.

1. David Yates

When the Harry Potter franchise concludes David Yates will be one of Hollywood’s most in-demand directors. He has made the greatest films in the franchise balancing heart-pounding action sequences with intelligent emotional narratives. Yates except for Johnston is the only filmmaker on this list who appears to care about people and plot which may make him the incorrect option for Transformers. Remember that Steve Kloves did an amazing job adapting the Harry Potter novels and producing successful movies is made simpler when you have such solid source material.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbmltZW5ld3NuZXR3b3JrLmNvbS9kYWlseS1icmllZnMvMjAyMi0wMi0yNi90cmFuc2Zvcm1lcnMtYm90Ym90cy1hbmltYXRlZC1zZXJpZXMtdW52ZWlscy02LXByb21vdGlvbmFsLWltYWdlcy8uMTgyOTc10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Transformers: BotBots Animated Series Unveils 6 Promotional Images - News,"Netflix revealed six promotional images on Wednesday for the animated series based on Hasbro 's Transformers: BotBots toy line.

Boulder Media Limited announced last week that the series will debut on Netflix on March 25.

Netflix ordered the 20-episode series in early 2021 from Hasbro 's Entertainment One subsidiary. BotBots are a sub-brand of Hasbro 's Transformers robot toys that launched in 2018.

Kevin Burke and Chris Wyatt ( Transformers : Rescue Bots Academy) are serving as executive producers for the series. Hasbro describes the story:

BotBots are Transformers robots that disguise themselves as everyday mall objects. By day these BotBots hide quietly on store shelves but at night they jump into adventure until a group of BotBots called ‘The Lost Bots’ run into the mall security guard and put all the bots in danger. Will these misfits be able to overcome their differences defeat the security guard and gain acceptance in the eyes of the other bots?

While I loved Kenner’s Ecto-1 both the original and Hasbro’s release being one of my all-time favorite toys there’s no denying that it is missing some details that could help take it to the next level.





It appears that Twitter user slaysghost thought the same recently giving the vehicle a makeover by adding additional paint details to the roof rack red fins and front body.

Not stopping at paint you’ll also notice the addition of lights with slaysghost also providing the below video showing them off in action:

If you’re somehow a little fuzzy on that original Kenner Ecto-1 the below gallery compares the two next to one another and it’s safe to say the added paint really helps with giving the toy that classic Real Ghostbusters vibe!

Dominion Hospital in Falls Church Virginia operates the only eating disorder program on the East Coast to receive The Joint Commission’s disease-specific care certification for offering help and hope to adolescents teens and adults with eating disorders.

Eating disorder awareness can make a big difference: The earlier an eating disorder is detected and treated the better a person’s chances are for a full recovery. Knowing the risk factors signs and symptoms can help you recognize these patterns in yourself and your loved ones so that you can seek necessary treatment.

What you eat and how you exercise both play important roles in your overall health. Spending some time thinking about weight diet activity levels and general health can be valuable for improving lifestyle habits but for people with eating disorders thoughts about food can become obsessive and result in eating patterns and other behaviors that may be dangerous to their health.

Who is at risk for eating disorders?

National surveys estimate that 20 million women and 10 million men in America will have an eating disorder at some point in their lives. Although eating disorders are most common in teens and young adults no one is immune to the risk of developing an eating disorder. They can affect people of all ages regardless of weight race ethnicity socioeconomic status and sexual or gender identity. The emphasis on body image starts early in life with research suggesting children as young as three can develop a negative body image. Meanwhile rates of obesity continue to rise among children and adults in the U.S. which can lead to serious health problems.

Common eating disorders

There are several eating disorders each with different signs and symptoms.

Anorexia nervosa

People with anorexia nervosa avoid food or restrict caloric intake to the point where they may become dangerously underweight — even as they continue to think of themselves as overweight. Some people with anorexia eat very little food or only certain kinds of food. Others may consume large amounts of food and then induce vomiting or use laxatives to purge their bodies and avoid weight gain. Although the disorder most frequently begins during adolescence anorexia can affect people of all ages. If anorexia goes untreated those who suffer from the disorder may be at a higher risk of complications and death from malnutrition or suicide.

Bulimia nervosa

Individuals with bulimia nervosa eat unusually large amounts of food and then use compensatory behaviors such as induced vomiting fasting exercise or laxatives to prevent weight gain. Those suffering from this disorder may have a normal body mass index but could also be overweight. There are several signs and symptoms of bulimia including frequent trips to the bathroom after meals chronic sore throat tooth decay from vomiting and gastrointestinal distress.

Binge eating disorder

Parkland Medical Center in New Hampshire provides a disease-specific certified eating disorder program for adolescents and adults.

Binge eating disorder is similar to bulimia but without purging. People with this disorder typically eat large amounts of food often in a short amount of time even if they are not hungry. They may feel great shame and distress over this habit and may frequently diet but not actually lose weight. People who struggle with binge eating disorder the most common eating disorder in the United States tend to be of normal or higher-than-average weight.

Avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID)

As with anorexia people with avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) may severely restrict the type and amount of food they eat. However people with ARFID are not motivated by distorted body image or fear of weight gain. ARFID is more common in young children but can occur in adults as well. While many children are picky eaters children with ARFID do not eat enough calories to grow and develop properly. Symptoms in children or adults may include lack of appetite or interest in food upset stomach or abdominal pain limited range of food preferences and dramatic weight loss.

How to start a conversation about eating disorders

If you struggle with an eating disorder or think you recognize some of the signs or symptoms of an eating disorder in yourself or a loved one the first step is to seek help. While feelings of guilt and shame are often attached to eating disorders and body image many sufferers find it difficult to discuss. If you are concerned about a loved one and you’re not sure how to approach the topic consider gently sharing your concerns and suggesting that they get a check-up at the very least.

Because the topics of weight diet and exercise often come up in discussions of health even a trip to the doctor’s office may feel overwhelming. It is important to keep in mind early treatment for eating disorders increases the chances of full recovery.

The following steps can help you prepare for a healthcare visit or a conversation about eating disorders.

If you have concerns take some time to consider how you’ve been feeling about your body and your eating habits. You may want to write down your thoughts in a journal or notebook to take to the doctor’s office. You can use these questions to guide your thinking:

How do you feel about your body?

What does healthy eating mean to you?

Do you eat when you’re stressed or bored even if you are not hungry?

Do you eat so much that you feel uncomfortably full?

Are there situations in which you’d be more likely to skip a meal or eat more than usual?

What are your activity levels like? What kinds of physical activities do you enjoy? How much time do you spend exercising?

What questions do you have about what’s healthy for your body?

If you have questions about your eating habits you don’t have to wait for the doctor to bring up the topic. Talk openly and honestly about your concerns and struggles with eating or body images. When your doctor makes a recommendation — whether it concerns weight loss or evaluating a possible eating disorder — make sure you have the tools and resources you need to follow up such as suggestions for helpful literature or the contact information of a dietician. You and your doctor should work together to set specific achievable goals using methods that are most likely to work for you.

The National Eating Disorders Association offers steps to help you encourage a loved one with eating and/or body image issues to seek help:

Learn as much as you can about eating disorders. Read books articles and brochures. Know the difference between facts and myths about weight nutrition and exercise. Knowing the facts will help you reason with your friend about any inaccurate ideas that may be fueling their disordered eating patterns.

This may help reduce your anxiety and clarify exactly what you want to say. Other people have found writing out their main points helpful.

This may help reduce your anxiety and clarify exactly what you want to say. Other people have found writing out their main points helpful. Set a private time and place to talk. No one wants to have personal issues dissected in front of a crowd so make sure you find a time and place where you will have time to discuss your concerns without being rushed or in front of a crowd.

Be honest. Talk openly and honestly about your concerns with the person who is struggling with eating or body image problems. Avoiding it or ignoring it won’t help!

Talk openly and honestly about your concerns with the person who is struggling with eating or body image problems. Avoiding it or ignoring it won’t help! Use “I” statements. Focus on behaviors that you have personally observed such as “I have noticed that you aren’t eating dinner with us anymore” or “I am worried about how frequently you are going to the gym.” It’s easy to sound accusatory (“You’re not eating! You’re exercising too much!”) which can cause a person to feel defensive. Instead stick to pointing out what you’ve observed. If you can also point out behaviors not related to eating and weight which may be easier for the person to see and accept.

Instead talk about behaviors and changes you have observed and calmly point out why you are concerned (“I have seen you run to the bathroom after meals and feel worried you might be making yourself throw up.”).

Be caring but be firm. Caring about your friend does not mean being manipulated by them. Your friend must be responsible for their actions and the consequences of those actions. Avoid making rules promises or expectations that you cannot or will not uphold. For example “I promise not to tell anyone.” Or “If you do this one more time I’ll never talk to you again.”

Remind your loved one that there’s no shame in admitting you struggle with an eating disorder or other mental health issue. Many people will be diagnosed with these issues during their lifetimes and many will recover. Avoid overly simplistic solutions. Being told “just stop” or “just eat” isn’t helpful. It can leave the sufferer feeling frustrated defensive and misunderstood.

Being told “just stop” or “just eat” isn’t helpful. It can leave the sufferer feeling frustrated defensive and misunderstood. Be prepared for negative reactions. Some eating disorder sufferers are glad that someone has noticed they are struggling. Others respond differently. Some may become angry and hostile insisting that you are the one with the problem. Others may brush off your concerns or minimize potential dangers. Both of these responses are normal. Reiterate your concerns let them know you care and leave the conversation open.

Don’t wait until the situation is so severe that your friend’s life is in danger. Your friend needs a great deal of support and understanding.

Recovery from an eating disorder can be a long process that requires help from qualified healthcare professionals as well as the love and support of family and friends.

A job fair for 75 Western Nevada College nursing students was conducted for the first time in five years on Feb. 15.

Hosted by the National Student Nurses’ Association the fair offered an opportunity to secure future employment interview with hospitals and health care facilities learn more from four-year colleges about bachelor degree opportunities and scholarship funding available through WNC Foundation.

“The facilities that participated were really excited about the caliber of our students” said nursing faculty member Kathy Cocking. “Facilities were offering them jobs on the spot and others said they could come work for them as a CNAs until they finished nursing school.”

Cocking helped the students prepare for the fair weeks in advance through mock interviews and crafting their résumés.

“We did interviews in class two weeks ago and they were critiqued” Cocking said. “They also learned about professional attire and appropriate demeanor for interviews.”

She said the students impressed the participants.

“I felt like a proud mother when they walked in” Cocking said. “They were engaged and enthusiastic. The vendors were so impressed by our students.”

Hospitals from the area that participated in the Job Fair included Carson Tahoe Health Renown Regional Medical Center Veterans Administration Medical Center St. Mary’s Medical Center Carson Valley Medical Center and Banner Churchill.

Participating long-term health facilities included Gardnerville Health and Rehab Center Mountain View Health and Rehabilitation and Carson Nursing and Rehabilitation Center. Home Care agencies that took part in the event were Visiting Angels and Amada Senior Care. HCA Health Care also attended recruiting candidates for its facilities in Las Vegas.

Students who are planning to pursue their bachelor of science degree in nursing were able to meet with representatives from the University of Nevada Reno Orvis School of Nursing American Sentinel College of Nursing and Health Sciences and Chamberlain University.

The Foundation also attended so they could talk to students about scholarship opportunities available to assist with their educational expenses.

The colleges hospitals and health care facilities that attended the Job Fair made donations to the college’s association chapter to help students attend the upcoming national convention in Salt Lake City.

Cocking said that all second-year nursing students were required to attend the fair but not all first-year nursing and CNA students participated.

The Washington Capitals announced Sunday morning that they have re-assigned goaltenders Vitek Vanecek (conditioning loan) and Pheonix Copley to the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League (AHL). Vanecek has been sidelined since February 1 when he was injured (upper-body) in the game against the Pittsburgh Penguins.

The Bears host the Utica Comets this evening at 5:00 PM at Giant Center. It’s likely Vanecek will get the start then possibly return to Washington in time to backup Ilya Samsonov Monday night against the Maple Leafs.

Vanecek 26 has posted a record of 10-6-5 with two shutouts a 2.39 goals-against average and a .915 save percentage this season. In 24 games the 6’2″ 184-pound goaltender has a 1.75 goals-against average and a .935 save percentage at five-on-five. The Havlickuv Brod Czech Republic native has the lowest goals-against average and rebounds allowed per 60 minutes of play (1.86) and the fourth highest save percentage in the NHL at five-on-five among goaltenders with at least 15 games played.

In 61 career games with the Capitals Vanecek is 31-16-9 with four shutouts a 2.58 goals-against average and a .910 save percentage.

The Capitals selected Vanecek with their second-round pick 39th overall in the 2014 NHL Draft. Washington re-acquired Vanecek from the Seattle Kraken for a second-round draft pick (originally acquired from the Winnipeg Jets) in the 2023 NHL Draft on July 28 2021.

Copley 30 made 21 saves in his season debut on Feb. 2 against the Edmonton Oilers and has appeared in two games for Washington this season. In 31 career NHL games the North Pole Alaska native is 16-9-3 with one shutout a 2.98 goals-against average and a .900 save percentage.

In 22 games with the Bears this season Copley has posted a record of 13-7-2 with two shutouts a 2.43 goals-against average and a .909 save percentage leading the Bears in each respective category.

HPE is currently in advanced talks with two large service providers and two data centre hosts to deploy its GreenLake infrastructure solutions for major data centre projects.

Speaking to BusinessLine Som Satsangi Managing Director – India HPE said “You need to understand why this emphasis on data centres by the Finance Minister. The government is also saying that you can’t take customer and citizen’s data outside the country. That’s why companies like Visa and Mastercard are trying to bring massive infrastructure in the country as they have to do it. Even some of the cloud service providers have started bringing data centre infrastructure to India as they cannot take data outside the country.”

He added “We feel data is growing the fastest. Today Gartner is saying that we are only using and accessing 6 per cent of the total data generated by the enterprises. That’s why the finance minister said that we need to add more data centres in the country. If you want to build a HPC (high performance computing) cluster large infrastructure for R&D and innovation for the government how will you do that unless you have right data centre?”

According to Satsangi such developments are only going to help companies like HPE which is into providing data centre infrastructure building solutions through GreenLake that includes deploying storage devices and hardware as well among other software solutions. The budget announcement had led to several companies starting to work on new data centre projects within the country.

“We are already in advanced talks with two large service providers and two data centre hosts on how we can partner with them and create their future journeys. We help building data centres through our offerings. We have telecom companies banks and government companies as customers” he said.

Distributed data centres

HPE is closely working with all the key telecom companies in the country whom it has helped in ramping up 4G deployment in remote areas during Covid. Next up the company is working on their 5G expansion plans ahead of the possible spectrum auction to be held this year.

“We have partnered with all telecom operators on their 4G roll out now we are working with them on their 5G expansion plans on how they can be ahead of the curve before the spectrum auction is finalised. These companies are looking to build a disruptive technology beforehand to enable IoT and blockchain use cases through 5G network. We are working on multiple areas with our customers to help them on their transformation journey” Satsangi said.

He added “5G is going to disrupt all automobile manufacturing and ancillary units. We are going to bring AI & ML on shop floor and that will need massive compute in real time environment. With the telecoms we will be able to take real time decisions on Edge computer. With the 5G roll out our customers will start having distributed data centres instead of centralised data centres. We are working proactively with telcos. Also manufacturing companies on how they can integrate 5G in their operations.”

Distributed data centres he said can be enabled through Edge computers which can be installed anywhere and doesn’t need a fixed data centre to gather and process information. With Edge computer HPE will be able to gather data directly from the source or sensors in real time. Adding 5G to it will make decision making more agile and real time without needing too much human intervention.

It is with profound sadness that the family of Tom Hendrick recently of Kelowna British Columbia and former long-time resident of Calgary Alberta announces he passed away peacefully at the age of 64 on February 21 2022 at Hospice House Kelowna. Tom was surrounded by his family during his very brief and sudden illness.



Tom will be missed terribly by his loving family including his wife Jennifer (Stark) Hendrick; two children Jason Hendrick (Sarah Durham) of Calgary AB and Elizabeth Hendrick (Eric Rogers) of Fredericton NB; two step-children Kelsey Meyer (Rohn) and Kevin Drozdowski (Ashley) all of Calgary AB; and four precious grandchildren: Cameron Andrew Conrad and Sophia. Tom is also survived by his five siblings: Bob Hendrick (Arley) of Kemptville ON Catherine Revells (late Mike) of Nepean ON Janice O’Connor (late Joe) of Wainwright AB Dianne Hendrick of Ottawa ON and Jim Hendrick (Angie) of Henderson Nevada; and many nieces nephews great nieces and great nephews. He was predeceased by his parents Connor and Mary Hendrick (nee Morris) and several uncles and aunts.



Tom was born in Ottawa Ontario on February 13 1958 and grew up in Old Chelsea Quebec. He was one of six children born into a large farm family in the Gatineau area. In his youth Tom played Junior A Fastball as a pitcher with the Hull Volants. He also worked at the ski hill at Camp Fortune where he met his first wife Alexandra Gwilliam. After graduating high school Tom attended Algonquin College in Ottawa. Tom and Alex moved to Calgary AB in 1979 where they raised their family and made many life-long friends. He finished his education at Southern Alberta Institute of Technology and began a very successful 40-year career as a sales executive working for various Information Technology and Cybersecurity companies such as NCR Canada Ltd. GE Capital IT Solutions Dell Canada Inc. Crowntek Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Secureworks.



Tom’s athleticism was evident throughout his lifetime. He continued playing ball in a community slow pitch league and the family spent many winter weekends skiing at Lake Louise. Tom also loved coaching kids in baseball and was an official on deck at his children’s swim meets for years. Boating and water sports while vacationing with close friends in Osoyoos every summer were some of his favourite memories. Tom was an avid golfer; however as much as he enjoyed golf he always said there was nothing better than playing hockey with his buddies in Calgary and Kelowna. Besides his passion for sports Tom loved live music concerts and performances. He also supported many community initiatives by volunteering for the Heart and Stroke Foundation the Canadian Cancer Society swim club fundraising casinos and others.



In 2017 Tom married his beloved wife Jennifer. The Hendricks moved to Kelowna in the fall of 2019 and settled into a wonderful retirement life where they created many precious memories. Moving to the Okanagan Valley was a dream of the couple and a home on the golf course was the perfect place to retire. Tom often said he couldn’t be happier in his new home and community where the couple enjoyed golfing cycling hiking wine-tasting exploring the area and socializing with dear new friends and neighbours. Family was everything to Tom and he embraced Jenn’s children and grandchildren as his own. He especially loved ‘little gaffers’ and had a special fondness for babies. Tom and Jennifer cherished their visits with family and friends who will always remember his soft caring heart positive attitude gentle ways humility generous spirit fun sense of humour and beaming smile. He was a truly kind thoughtful patient and selfless man who was loved adored and respected as a role model.



Tom’s quiet strength and courage were reflected in the way he faced several serious health challenges over the years. He died peacefully in the night with his wife by his side just one month after being diagnosed with a very aggressive form of cancer. The family would like to express sincere appreciation to the doctors and staff at Kelowna General Hospital and Hospice House Kelowna for their gentle compassionate care in Tom’s final days.



Cremation arrangements are entrusted to First Memorial Funeral Services. The family will be hosting a celebration of Tom’s life in Calgary AB on Saturday May 28. Due to the ever-changing pandemic situation please email [email protected] to be added to the email list for details and updates about attending in person or online.

A Customer Incident

Without going into significant detail in this post (another will follow with further insights) a customer from my travel agency was notified directly by the property that they were out of rooms for the traveler and that they would need to find another property. However they didn’t appear to follow the protocol by which the hotel finds them another hotel room (whether in the same brand or not.) Oversells happen all the time and both my team and my client have experienced this often the more one travels the more likely it is to happen and this client is away from home approximately 39 weeks annually.

The odd response by the hotel prompted a phone call from me to the hotel to understand what was going on and then a clarification email to Hilton to make sure I understood the policy.

What Happens When A Hotel Oversells Its Rooms

Most travelers understand what happens when an airline has an overbooked flight and they deny boarding resulting in bumped passengers. Airlines hotels and car rental agencies sell more tickets rooms and cars than they have because many travelers miss flights or connections and if they did not oversell they would end up with unutilized inventory. Revenue managers have done the math and found that it’s cheaper to bump or deny service than the cost of customer service issues for a minority of customers. Consistently empty seats are simply more expensive especially in business class.

The Department of Transportation has very clear rules about this for air travel. If one volunteers their seat they can (sometimes) negotiate a generous cash payout or voucher and secure a seat on the next flight departing for their destination. If no volunteers come forward the bumped passenger is removed from the plane and eligible for compensation up to 4x the price of their ticket. United Airlines had a horrific public relations issue when it could find no such volunteer and had Dr. Dao dragged off a flight. However they don’t have a policy for cars or hotels.

At most hotel chains the policy in an oversell situation is to contact the guest when the oversell occurs re-accommodate them within the chain or at a nearby hotel convenient for the customer at no additional cost to the customer (and usually a refund of the night they paid for in that hotel.) Most oversell situations occur in close proximity to the check-in day for example an airport Hilton hotel might find a large number of canceled flights due to weather the hotel is oversold and the management tries to accommodate customers at a nearby Homewood Suites (a Hilton Worldwide company.) If that is impossible they typically will start working with hotels nearest to the one booked in both stature and distance.

The guest while inconvenienced and disappointed is not made homeless for the night and is compensated for their trouble. This typically falls on the night audit (sometimes the only staff member on duty) as late check-ins arrive at an oversold hotel. The guest is then “walked” (not literally) to the new hotel with apologies and compensation as necessary.

Hilton Doesn’t Make This Information Readily Available

Hilton doesn’t disclose this information and makes you dig to find it. Hyatt has it on its website. Accor puts it in its terms and conditions Marriott puts it in plain English and IHG has a similar policy on full display. Hilton doesn’t really put it out there and so I wanted to clarify some questions about oversell situations (both to better understand since it’s not readily available and to understand the issue for my client.) Here are the questions pertinent to this that I posed to Hilton PR earlier this week:

If a [confirmed reservation] doesn’t offer language that it needs to be “reconfirmed” days prior to arrival is there any reason to believe it wouldn’t fall under the walking policy for an overbooked/oversold hotel? Is the following the oversold policy of Hilton: “The guest must be relocated at other Hilton branded hotel if possible. The hotel must pay the full cost of the first night’s stay including any expenses incurred such as transportation and phone calls to family members and business associates. Hotel must complete an online form and send it to Hilton to ensure that the guest receives the stay/night credit and all the points associated with the stay had the guest not been walked.” Do franchised locations have to adhere to these policies or are they exempt? In which cases would an exemption apply What would a franchised location do if there a) aren’t any other Hiltons in the area to walk them to and b) aren’t any hotel rooms available in the same town so there is nowhere to walk the guest to? What is the priority for choosing whom to walk when walking a guest? Check-in time elite status when the reservation was placed? If a hotel is soldout for a number of weeks additional reservations will be taken in the interim (oversell) however at a certain point those bookings will no longer be taken – what’s that threshold (5%? 10%)? When does a hotel receive booking details from Hilton.com? If a corporate client books an entire hotel would there be [a] reason to not make those re[-accommodations] in advance [of] the check-in day?

My Attempts To Reach Out

In the spirit of trying to get the right information to readers I contacted Hilton a staggering amount of times for which they ignored nearly all of my questions. Here is the log of those communications:

Monday February 21st 2022 11:05 AM Eastern – The above questions were sent.

Tuesday February 22nd 2022 4:42 PM Eastern – Called Hilton PR as I’d not heard anything back.

Wednesday February 23rd 2022 4:52 PM Eastern – Forwarded original email to Hilton PR as I’d not heard anything back.

Wednesday February 23rd 2022 4:53 PM Eastern – Called Hilton PR as I’d not heard anything back.

Wednesday February 23rd 2022 8:22 PM Eastern – Hilton PR replied back not addressing the above but stating I had to have permission of the guest for them to speak to that specific issue.

Wednesday February 23rd 2022 9:30 PM Eastern – Guest replied-all granting permission to speak to the issue

Thursday February 24th 9:10 PM Eastern – Hilton PR responds to the guest’s issues to me only and says only the following that can be attributed to their oversell walk policy:”Hilton properties work hard to accommodate all our guests at all times. In the rare event we are unable to accommodate a reservation we make every effort to provide alternate accommodations at one of our nearby properties.“

Thursday February 24th 10:18 PM Eastern – I respond back pointing out some errors in the rest of their response but note that they still have not given any response to what their walk policy entails. Not a single point was addressed:”but this doesn’t address ANY of the questions regarding Hilton’s walk policy especially as it pertains to franchised locations” and then I offered to push publication to give them time to answer.

Friday February 25th 2022 4:16 PM Eastern – Client calls me to inform me that a rep from Hilton PR contacted the guest to learn more about the situation from their perspective. However despite stating they would follow up with additional details to the guest they had nothing more as of publication.

Sunday February 27th 10:39 AM Eastern – I still have no further information about the Hilton walk policy published the article as-is.

Conclusion

I initially reached out to clarify the policy because I couldn’t find it outside of GodSaveThePoints who published a brilliant piece on the matter but almost seven months ago and many things have changed since then. I wanted to know what the policy is/was exactly and any caveats that needed to be considered. Hilton Public Relations’ job is to communicate with media members (yes even bloggers) and represent the brand while maintaining the presitge of its reputation in the process. Absconding from that seems like dereliction of duty at best intentional avoidance at worst.

Hyatt Accor IHG and even Marriott publish the policy openly but despite four emails two phone calls and a good effort searching for statements on the matter from Hilton – it’s clear that Hilton doesn’t want guests to know their policy for oversell situations. Take the only possible mention in their statement “In the rare event we are unable to accommodate a reservation we make every effort to provide alternate accommodations at one of our nearby properties” with a grain of salt. It doesn’t state what is due to guests what Hilton will do in a situation where there are no other Hilton properties and what priority oversold rooms are selected for honoring the reservation and walking them. I have really enjoyed Hilton properties but this leaves an awfully sour taste in my mouth from the one area of its business that should be pros at giving basic information about the chain’s policies.

What do you think? Is Hilton intentionally hiding this information? If so why?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdHJhdmVsbGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy10cmF2ZWwvMjAyMi8wMi8yNi9oaWx0b24tb3BlbnMtaGFtcHRvbi1wcm9wZXJ0eS1pbi1iYXRoL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hilton opens Hampton property in Bath – Business Traveller,"The property’s design has been inspired by the local area with the building’s facade constructed with locally-sourced sustainable Bath stone.

Among the items cut from many hotels are breakfast housekeeping restaurants lounges pools spas gyms kids clubs room service and even concierges.

Some people report pens notepads and ""Do Not Disturb"" signs seem to have also gone the way of the dodo bird at some properties.

For more TPG news delivered each morning to your inbox sign up for our daily newsletter.

""I don't think these cuts are going to be reversed anytime soon and in fact I will be shocked if we see some of these amenities returning in the next few years"" said Tim Jue a San Francisco-based reporter covering airlines and travel.

Resort and destination fees are the only things that didn't seem to get cut during the pandemic ... even as the list of what you are supposed to be getting for those fees continues to shrink.

That's something that also ticks off Jue who told TPG ""The real rub here is many hotels are still charging exorbitant resort fees on top of all these cuts. At the end of the day you're paying more for less and that's terrible value for your money.""

Some analysts think that guests are going to start revolting over the lack of amenities and service. ""When you are visiting a city and it is about to relax mask rules bars are open gyms are open and your hotel looks like East Berlin with everything closed or walled off -- especially at full-service hotels -- the guests are going to be furious and are not going to accept that"" said Henry Harteveldt - a travel industry analyst and president of Atmosphere Research.

No more free breakfast

Lots of hotels got rid of breakfast at their property during the pandemic. While breakfast service is coming back for many hotels the options hours and variety have often been cut to the bone.

""Hotel owners are wounded animals and they are roaring and clawing at their guests as they attempt to heal"" said Harteveldt. ""Hotel owners are unapologetic about it. They're putting their own profits ahead of anything their guests want or expect even when brands tell them that services are supposed to be restored.""

Related: How the pandemic has altered hotel amenities

We talked to readers in the TPG Lounge group on Facebook and as you can imagine the query set off quite the discussion.

They told TPG that breakfast still hasn't come back at some properties at all.

Suzanne Wolco had a recent stay in Fort Lauderdale where she said she wasn't surprised to find no room service but was surprised to find there was no breakfast at all. She said she was ""... told to go to local restaurants if I didn't want to do coffee shop in the lobby.""

Kelly Albomonti said she was missing hot decent breakfasts ""Microwaving a frozen breakfast sandwich myself isn't appealing to me.""

Other hotels offered only grab-and-go packs for breakfast during much of the pandemic. Fortunately that trend seems to have mostly gone away.

Don Digison told me he ""Stayed at Hilton Doubletree Miami International Airport prior to a cruise. Room was clean service was just okay and breakfast in the dining room was marginal at best. Overpriced (even with the credit for being Gold) and of very poor quality.""

There was a social media post last weekend that got my attention focused on the scaled-back breakfast benefits at Hilton.

During the pandemic Hilton rolled out a ""temporary"" policy on free breakfast for its Gold and Diamond members. That policy has now been extended through at least 2022. Instead of free breakfast Hilton elites get a food and beverage credit to use during their stay. The problem? It rarely covers a full breakfast.

Indeed Jue said while a daily room credit of $10 - $25 per day sounds nice in theory ""... but when the hotel restaurant charges $15 for a bagel and schmear the tab adds up quickly. You almost always spend more than the daily credit. I usually go outside the hotel for my morning nosh nowadays.""

That cut to the breakfast benefit is just one of the many drastic changes we've seen at hotels during COVID-19.

Where did the lounges go?

One of the strangest and longest-lasting cutbacks in hotels has been the demise of the hotel lounge. Executive floor lounges are in many hotels shuttered or gutted of any real food or beverage service.

""What's really annoying is when guests pay for products that aren't delivered' said Harteveldt ""so if you paid for a club-level room and have an expectation for an elevated experience and then are told the lounge is closed. That's not what those guests are paying for.""

When I asked readers in the TPG Lounge what they missed most many said the hotel lounge which in many places in the United States is either gone or a shell of its former self.

Sometimes if they are open the lounges will have a sad assortment of granola bars and if you're lucky a bottle of water.

(Photo by Clint Henderson/The Points Guy)

""Several hotels I stay at have declared that their lounges won't be coming back"" said Larry Kaplan in the TPG Lounge. He continued ""What's the point of having VIP floors at a higher price without a lounge?"" Kaplan called it a ""... deceitful way of lowering costs to raise profits and trying to blame it on COVID-19.""

Colleen Caldwell Specht told TPG ""We stayed at the Marriott in Irvine a few months ago and the executive lounge was only open on weekends. My trip had me arriving on Saturday and leaving mid week so we only got to enjoy our free breakfast on one day of our stay.""

Blair Soucy told us ""Hyatt O'Hare Regency Club was closed on my last visit but they did set up a $20 breakfast buffet...should have been comped... .""

Another reader told me the lounges at both the Hyatt Regency and the Grand Hyatt in Denver remain closed but not due to COVID-19 but both telling him it was due to lack of staff.

That lack of staffing may have as much to do with the lack of some amenities as COVID-19. Tim Jue said:

""Hotels really suffered during the pandemic and they're still going through incredibly turbulent times so they're looking to cut as much as they can to keep the lights on. The labor shortage rising cost of doing business and supply crunch are exacerbating the pressure this industry is facing and I can't see many hotels bringing back hot breakfast buffets or lounges for elite members in the near term. For travelers this is going to mean less value for your dollar. Hotel lounges for elite members typically had great happy hour offerings -- but I believe that's now a thing of the past.""

Gary Hoel said he didn't buy the reasoning some hotels were offering "" ... they say because of lack of staffing. Somehow international hotels manage just not in the U.S. (recent stays in Iceland London Miami and Anchorage).""

No more daily housekeeping

Many hotels dropped daily housekeeping during the pandemic and at some hotels (like most Hiltons) it's now a thing of the past. Indeed at Hilton housekeeping is ""by request only."" Guests who want their rooms cleaned have to call the front desk and even then it sometimes only means fresh towels and an emptied wastebasket.

""Housekeeping at many hotels I've stayed at is on request only and I see this practice becoming the norm given the labor shortages in the industry"" said Jue.

""At some hotels housekeeping may be gone for good"" Harteveldt confirmed continuing:

""Three-star and two-star brands' daily housekeeping may be going away or be on request only but at four-star hotels guests are paying for and expect service and amenities and this is where the battle is the most intense. This is where the hotel owners are setting themselves up for massive problems. When brands create expectations of what guests should expect and loyalty programs add to those in terms of promised benefits guests are going to expect them. This is especially true for brands that have longer histories...brands like Hilton Marriott Westin Crown Plaza Kimpton Hyatt and other four-star brands guests are going to expect that housekeeping will be available restaurants will be available gym and so on.""

That was one of the biggest complaints we heard in the TPG Lounge was the lack of daily housekeeping.

Kyle Parks told me he was currently staying at the Renaissance in St. Augustine ""Housekeeping will come in and refresh the towels but not make the bed or empty the trash.""

No gym

Gyms were closed early in the pandemic when we weren't sure exactly how COVID-19 was spread. Most hotels have now reopened their gyms though some remain closed or have limited capacity and hours. At some hotels reservations are required.

Traci Chenini said she was aggravated at ""Having to make reservations for using the gym. On a short stay if you don't know to reserve in advance you don't get to go. And half the time the gym is empty anyway since people reserve and don't show up.""

Erica Ramos told me the gym remains an issue at the Hyatt House in Emeryville in the San Francisco Bay Area ""... gym is by reservation only so impossible to get a morning slot if you check in the day before. Also no notification of this if you check in through the app.""

No pool hot tub or other water features

Many hotels shut down their pools hot tubs saunas waterparks and other water features during the coronavirus pandemic like the Hilton Waikiki as you can see from the photo above and the Sonesta in Kauai which had its hot tubs closed in the height of the pandemic.

No more hotel shuttles

(Photo by Clint Henderson/The Points Guy)

This was a big pain point for me personally a few times. When I arrived in Fairbanks late one evening with my elderly father the hotel shuttle was nowhere to be found. When I called the front desk at the Hyatt Place where we were staying no one ever answered the phone. Fortunately a shuttle driver for a competing hotel took pity on us and dropped us off at the hotel. When we arrived I saw the shuttle was parked in front but there was no driver. The front desk told me that sometimes the phones don't work but no driver was available anyway. Well then.

The next day I had to beg the overnight clerk to drop us off at the train station as there were few ride share drivers available in Fairbanks.

It's not so uncommon these days. Some hotels have dispensed with shuttle service all together or scaled back the hours it runs. In the age of Uber and Lyft driver shortages it's a bad combination.

Beverly Kerr told me ""Denver 24-hour airport shuttles last year were not offered by the hotel as mentioned on their website. Called the hotel took a long time to be able to speak to someone then was told the shuttle stopped half hour before our arrival. We had to get a Lyft. Another time last year the shuttle from the hotel to the airport was contracted out and made stops at other hotels causing stress to passengers about getting to the airport on time.""

Spas remain shut down or operating with reduced hours

Many spas have either shut down or are running with limited hours (including this one at the Alyeska Resort in Girdwood Alaska).

Restaurants are closed or have limited menus and hours

(Photo by Clint Henderson/The Points Guy)

A lot of times hotel lobbies have shuttered their restaurants altogether or only kept one open with limited hours. Room service has also disappeared from many hotels. I had a few hotel stays in Anchorage where there was one restaurant only operating with limited evening hours.

On another trip -- to the high-end Hotel 1000 in Seattle - the restaurant was excellent but only operating a few hours on a few days a week.

Jeffrey Eslinger told us in the TPG Lounge that he spent a week at the Grand Hyatt San Antonio and said there was ""... no room service no seated lunch dining option and the only seated dinner option was Ruth's Chris."" He did say that housekeeping was on top of it while he was there so we'll call that a win.

Goodbye to the concierge

(Photo by Clint Henderson/The Points Guy)

At many hotels the concierge desk is forlorn and abandoned -- either done away with completely or offering sporadic service. COVID-19 sped up a trend that had been underway for some time with many hotels ditching the concierge in the age of Google. Some hotels will even tell you to search for local attractions on Trip Advisor or hunt for restaurants on apps like Uber Eats.

Bad service or understaffing issues

When we asked what was missing from hotels these days Dan Horvath told TPG ""The simple things. Like 'thank you for being a Marriott Titanium elite member. We appreciate your loyalty.' No I'm not pretentious but little things like that make a difference. Oh and and any cut amenities where they cite ""health and safety"" as the reason. I'd rather them flat-out say 'we're cutting this because we are short staffed and trying to save money.'""

That was a common refrain from our readers -- that everything is reduced. Ta Lia Krajcovic said:

""We just stayed at a luxury property and while nothing was technically ""missing"" EVERYTHING was unreliable and inconsistent from service to amenities. One day service was fabulous the next day the phones rang and rang and rang and we couldn't reach a single person at the hotel. It feels like the system is overwhelmed with pent-up travel demand yet lack of trained staff. It really feels like the floodgates are opening on travel right now and I really don't think the travel industry systems are going to be able to handle it. So much frustration all around. I feel like people will be happier when it comes to travel if they go the fast casual route and don't expect all the amenities and services they r (SIC) used to.""

Bottom line

(Photo by Clint Henderson/The Points Guy)

Some of our favorite things about hotel stays were slashed during the pandemic and two years later they may not be coming back. While some service and amenities are returning slowly but surely others may be gone for good -- especially now that inflation staff shortages and companies' hunger for bigger profits look to be sticking around for a while. Unfortunately resort fees are apparently here for good. If the pandemic didn't kill them nothing probably can at this point (aside from governments passing laws against them). Meantime those resort fees are covering less and less.

But analysts say hotels are playing with fire. ""What's going to happen is hotel guests will adopt the same behavior as airline passengers where they view hotels as substitutable commodities and focus more on price and book the least expensive rooms and rates they can find"" said Harteveldt. ""If hotel owners and operators are not careful they will create a death spiral for their businesses.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9pc3JhZWwtbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTY5ODczM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Collection hotels could be the future of the industry in Israel,"Collection hotels might be the future of the industry in Israel as apparently this is what guests are demanding

Entering Jaffa’s impressive renovated well-maintained building that once housed the School of the Sisterhood of Saint Joseph convent and adjacent 19th-century former French hospital you will be impressed.

An extensive seven-year restoration preservation and renovation created an impressive boutique accommodation – The Jaffa luxury hotel. A partly hidden sign indicates that the hotel is part of a luxury collection. To the puzzled traveler it might be an enigma but for the experienced one it is an indication of the best there is. Yet no sign board or any clue makes the guest aware that the hotel is part of the mighty Marriott hotel brand.

The term “collection” as far as hotels are concerned is creating a global buzz and The Jaffa may be the harbinger that indicates that a rise in international collections is coming.

What are these collection hotels? In most cases these are a collection of independent hotels that join a major brand’s platform while retaining their own names and branding. THE ISROTEL Dead Sea Hotel (credit: ISROTEL)

This trend is called soft-branding or umbrella-branding established by recognized hotel chains to meet the increasing demand of hotel experiences. In recent years the hospitality industry is fostering individuality. They appeal to hotel owners that do not wish to be held to strict standards of a classic brand.

However they eat the cake and have it at the same time. They operate their hotels themselves under a recognized brand. This joint venture is a win-win that allows for the proliferation of soft brands.

At the same time it energizes the individual existing hotel and owners enjoy the strong distribution of a reputed brand network. The bonus is the exposure to millions of loyalty club members who love to receive perks like complimentary breakfast room upgrades and hotel credits.

For the global brands it is like opening a box of candies – a potential for huge growth as they are interested in signing as many hotels as they can to their commercial systems. In no time they assure immediate positive cash flows with no risk at all.

Marriott’s Luxury Collection is defined as “comprised of world-renowned hotels and resorts offering unique authentic experiences that evoke lasting treasured memories.”

“The Jaffa is a unique historic luxury property that Marriott is proud to have in its portfolio and to expose to more than 140 million members of its Bonvoy loyalty program” says General Manager Michael Schmid. “Our standards are similar to our luxury Ritz Carlton brand but we try to be less formal in keeping our individuality.”

Isrotel one of Israel’s dominant hotel chains announced last December a new branding which classifies its hotels into three segments. “Isrotel Collection – the vacation and resort hotels suitable for families. Exclusive – the chain’s luxury hotels and Design – hotels of up to 200 rooms emphasizing design experience” says Nahum Kara Isrotel’s head of sales and marketing.

However those hotels will clearly carry the company name publicly. What is interesting is its Design’s Publica hotel in Herzliya introducing a mysterious sign at the entrance – Autograph Collection.

This collection is a group of independent upscale-to-luxury hotels within the Marriott International portfolio. This brand’s properties are independently owned and operated under the Autograph Collection name.

“The Ella brothers the Publica co-owners successfully initiated that cooperation with Marriott when the hotel was launched” explains Kara.

The Autograph experience itself caters to unique preferences such as culinary historical exploration arts family sports and urban tours – surely aiming for the Millennials which dominate Herzliya Pituah workplaces.

How significant is the collection buzz? It’s the future of the industry as apparently this is what Millennials will demand. Israeli tourism expert Joseph Fischer with 40 years of experience working for leading international hospitality brands is confident.

“If there’s something that the corona pandemic should teach the lodging sector it is that constant change is here to stay. All those big old ‘cookie-cutter’ brands lost their attractiveness in the new world led by Millennials. Nowadays it’s all about creating experiences and memories and not about hard standards – room sizes and executive lounges. The collection is a good solution for big brands that want to stay attractive” he says.

Indications here are starting to pop up. Only recently Hilton announced plans to introduce for the first time two of its collection hotels in Israel. The LXR and Curio properties on Tel Aviv’s waterfront next to Independence Park. They are scheduled to open in 2026.

Will other international or Israeli brands follow with their own collection portfolio?

Stay tuned. For us the customers this is great news. We are exposed to endless new hospitality opportunities and surprises with competitive prices and pampering rewards for memorable experiences while the collection variant is buzzing.

The fourth quarter topped off a phenomenal year for home improvement giant Home Depot (HD -0.16%) with high growth all around as well as a significant dividend increase. The past two years have been out of character for the U.S. retailer and going forward it's anticipating slowing growth. But that shouldn't bother investors because the solid-value stock still has a lot to offer.

It was great while it lasted

Home Depot's customers have been on a shopping spree for most of the pandemic. Lockdowns and social distancing orders were a tailwind for the company as people with limited spending outlets and activities focused on home remodeling. This has already slowed down as the world has mostly reopened and people are out and spending in other areas.

Still Home Depot was able to tack on another 10.7% year-over-year sales increase in the fourth quarter on top of 25% last year. Comparable sales or sales from existing stores increased 8.1% in total and 7.6% in the U.S. while net income rose from $2.9 billion last year to $3.4 billion this year.

Home Depot also raised its dividend 15% -- and that's after raising it 10% for the past two years. The quarterly dividend of $1.90 brings its yield up to 1.9% at the current price far above the S&P 500 average of 1.39%.

Expect a slowdown but also further growth

Management said to expect sales and comps to be ""slightly positive"" in 2022. It's guiding for margins to stay flat with 2021 levels which were lower than 2020 levels due to higher costs and supply-chain investment. It also expects net income to post low growth. Wall Street is expecting $153.6 billion in 2022 revenue or a 1.6% increase from 2021 and $16.25 in earnings per share (EPS) for 2022 ahead of $15.53 in 2021.

The company posted record sales in 2021 and expects to outdo that in 2022 and management said its goal is to grow to $200 million in sales over time. It sees a $900 billion market opportunity in North America and between this opportunity and the company's efficient business practices that looks highly acheivable. The housing market is still hot and it's expected to keep surging in 2022 supporting a bigger market for Home Depot.

Several pressures exist going into 2022 in the form of continued supply-chain logjams and inflation and Home Depot is responding with price raises where necessary. It's also heavily investing in its own supply distribution network and omnichannel shopping features. It renovated several hundred stores in 2021 with its GSR (or ""get stores right"") initiative resulting in record sales per square foot of $605. It plans to renovate several hundred more this year which could apply short-term pressure for long-term efficiency. Its longer-term goal is to post ""best-in-class"" operating-profit dollar growth and return on invested capital.

Why Home Depot is a solid long-term pick

Investors weren't thrilled with the earnings outlook and lower margins and Home Depot stock fell nearly 9% after the fourth-quarter results were released. As for outlook it's not a surprising forecast and any growth on top of two past years is a positive sign for where the company is headed.

Home Depot stock has gained 117% over the past five years outdoing the S&P 500. It's a solid value stock with a clear market opportunity efficient capital usage and a strong dividend. Slowing growth shouldn't scare investors and now is an excellent time for new investors to buy shares on the dip.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZG90LmNvbS9pcmwvZ2x1ZS10cmFwcy1ob21lLWRlcG90LXByb3Rlc3QtdGlrdG9rL9IBRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZG90LmNvbS9pcmwvZ2x1ZS10cmFwcy1ob21lLWRlcG90LXByb3Rlc3QtdGlrdG9rLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘As they should’: Viral TikTok shows people protesting glue traps sold at Home Depot dividing viewers (updated),"A Home Depot in the Atlanta area has gone viral after a group of protesters gathered inside to oppose the selling of glue traps.

Popular Atlanta gossip brand ATL Scoop posted the video to its TikTok (@atlscooptiktok) two days ago. People inside the store were carrying and handing out flyers that said “Home Depot: Stop Selling Glue Traps.” They chanted what sounds like “Blood blood blood on our hands” while employees and customers milled about the store.

According to the Humane Society of the United States glue traps are trays coated with an extremely sticky adhesive. They are often used to get rid of rodents including rats. Many believe this is an inhumane way to get rid of pests since they suffer a slow death after getting caught in the glue. While many other countries such as New Zealand and Ireland have banned glue traps the United States has yet to join the list.

It’s unclear when the protest was held or who organized it. The TikTok has amassed 1.4 million views since it was posted. Thousands of viewers flooded the video’s comments section to debate the use of glue traps and the actual protest.

“AS THEY SHOULD! Ugh they’re so inhuman [sic]” one commented.

“People who think it’s funny to torture mice are no different than people who think it’s funny to torture dogs” another shared.

However many stood by the use of the traps to kill pests.

“Sometimes glue traps are the only way to get the job done” a user commented.

When commenters tried to explain the cruelty of using the glue traps such as the animal suffocating or ripping their limbs to get free several viewers didn’t see an issue.

“What’s wrong with that? idgaf about a fucking mouse” a user responded.

“Umm yeah they’re not human so it doesn’t matter if it’s inhumane” another said.

In regards to the actual protest many viewers felt there were more important things to be worrying about right now. Some even alluded to the dire situation currently happening in Ukraine.

“[Wide-eye emojis] Really? There is more important protest to be made!” one wrote.

“People getting slaughtered in the Ukraine and these people are protesting glue?” another asked.

“Bros there’s an all out war going on in Europe and American over here like” a viewer said.

Still others believed the two issues didn’t have to be mutually exclusive.

“Just because it doesn’t seem important to you doesn’t mean it’s not important to others” a user responded.

“You know it’s possible to care about more than one thing at a time” another said.

Update 11:22 am CT March 15: Meira Geyser is an Animal activism coach according to her LinkedIn and started a petition to “Ban Glue Traps at Home Depot.”

“I kept seeing glue traps at Home Depot & was especially upset about the cruelty after having pulled a trapped baby bird from one” Geyser told the Daily Dot. “Home Depot has been reached out to many times since September 2021 but continue to sell an unnecessarily cruel product.”

Geyser said the group seen in the video is the Animal Activism Mentorship. She said that while she was not at the protest itself she “worked with one of the group’s organizers to get them materials give them info on the campaign beforehand.”

The Daily Dot has reached out to the ATL Scoop via TikTok comment and Home Depot via email.

Rick Ross isn't one to pay extra cash for something he can do himself -- which is exactly why he became a lumberjack in his own backyard ... saving a pretty penny in the process.

Renzel was on landscaping duty this weekend at his Atlanta estate -- which is hundreds of acres in size consisting of quite a bit of land -- after deciding to cut down a flock of oak tress he had standing around that he wanted outta there ... one way or another.

He explains that he did a little shopping around for quotes on how much a job like this might cost and he was hit with a huge price tag ... $1000 per tree. At 10 trees ... that's $10k!!!

Play video content

No deal for RR ... who decided he'd just do the damn thing himself. As he explains here Rick tasked a buddy of his to hit Home Depot and snap up the biggest damn chainsaw they had on their racks.

Looks like the guy came back with just what the Boss needed ... 'cause he immediately got to work slicing up the trunk of one of the behemoths he wanted removed ... until it started to keel over.

In the end it would appear Rick got the job done -- and he also had a little fun with the saw too ... Leatherface-style. Easy there big fella ... that thing's still pretty dangerous. 😅",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdW50cnlsaXZpbmcuY29tL2dhcmRlbmluZy9nYXJkZW4taWRlYXMvZzM1NzQyMjUwL2Jlc3Qtd2F0ZXItcGxhbnRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,12 Best Water Plants - Plants That Grow Without Soil,"Sure you've planted tons of pretty annuals and perennials in your garden. But what about adding a water feature? Water gardens have been popular since ancient times in both private and public spaces. And it’s not difficult to understand why! Water is soothing and appeals to all of our senses. Water also attracts beneficial wildlife such as pollinators frogs and birds to visit your garden. And water plants—whether displayed in a small pond you build yourself or a large planter or half whiskey barrel—make any garden feel even more magical with their unique colors and forms.

Aquatic plants aren’t just about good looks. They also help control algae growth in your water garden. There are several different types: Floating plants which remain on the surface and extract nutrients from the water; submerged plants also called oxygenators which float on the water surface but can be planted in pots that sit on the bottom of ponds; bog plants which can survive with up to 3 inches of water over the plant’s crown (top); and deep water plants which can be covered by 4 to 10 inches of water over their crowns

Because space is limited in a water garden choose a variety of plants to add color interest height and algae control. Also select water plants that are native or non-invasive so you won’t accidentally introduce an aggressive species that clogs waterways or overtakes wildlife habitat. In fact many companies are not allowed to ship to certain states if a plant is considered invasive in a certain region. To learn what’s considered invasive in your state check with your local university coop extension service (find yours here). Or consult a local water garden nursery to help you plan your layout and select the hardiest types for your region.

Here are a few of the best water plants."

James F. Risoleo President and Chief Executive Officer said “Host delivered comparable hotel Total RevPAR growth of 0.5% over the first quarter of 2023 which is impressive given the challenging comparison of the prior year. Banquet revenues led our performance driven by improvements in group business and continued strong demand in food and beverage. In addition we delivered net income of $272 million a decline of 6.5% compared to the first quarter of 2023 and Adjusted EBITDAre of $483 million an 8.8% improvement over the first quarter of 2023. At the same time comparable hotel RevPAR declined 1.2% as a result of tough comparisons the impact of Maui and unseasonable weather in many markets that impacted short term leisure demand.”

Risoleo continued “Subsequent to quarter end we acquired the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown underscoring the strength of our balance sheet and our strategic approach to capital allocation. This two-hotel complex further improves the quality of our portfolio and establishes a meaningful presence for Host in a top performing market. As a result of the acquisition additional business interruption insurance gains and improving out-of-room spend we kept our net income guidance flat to our previous forecast while increasing the mid-point of our Adjusted EBITDAre guidance by 2%. We tightened our full year Total RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.7% to 4.6% and our RevPAR growth guidance range to 2.0% to 4.0% based on our performance in the first quarter the evolving nature of demand in Maui and our expectations for growth in the second half of the year. Given our fortress balance sheet and successful capital allocation execution we believe Host is well positioned to continue delivering EBITDA growth.”

See the Notes to Financial Information on why the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures.

HIGHLIGHTS:

Comparable hotel Total RevPAR was $369.58 representing an increase of 0.5% compared to first quarter of 2023 as strong contributions from group business led to an increase in food and beverage revenues with banquet and catering revenues per group room night in excess of the prior peak reached in first quarter of 2023.

Comparable hotel RevPAR was $215.37 for the first quarter of 2024 representing a decrease of 1.2% compared to first quarter of 2023 driven by the impacts of the Maui wildfires unseasonable weather conditions in several markets and unanticipated delays in renovation. In addition there were difficult comparisons to first quarter of 2023 which had experienced elevated levels of leisure demand leading to significant RevPAR growth.

GAAP net income was $272 million for first quarter of 2024 reflecting a 6.5% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decline in gain on asset sales partially offset by gains on insurance settlements recognized in the first quarter. GAAP operating profit margin was 19.8% an improvement of 180 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to the insurance gains.

Comparable hotel EBITDA was $435 million for first quarter of 2024 a 2.9% decrease compared to first quarter of 2023 leading to a comparable hotel EBITDA margin decline of 140 basis points to 31.2%. The decline for the quarter was driven by increased wages and higher insurance expenses in comparison to first quarter 2023.

Adjusted EBITDAre was $483 million for first quarter of 2024 exceeding 2023 by 8.8% driven by strong operating performance at The Ritz-Carlton Naples which was closed in the first half of 2023 due to Hurricane Ian and including the benefit of the business interruption gain.

To date the Company has received insurance proceeds of $263 million out of the expected potential insurance recovery of approximately $310 million for covered costs related to damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ian. The Company received $31 million in the first quarter and $10 million of these proceeds were recognized as a gain on business interruption.

Subsequent Acquisition

On April 15 2024 the Company acquired the fee simple interest in the 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for a total purchase price of $530 million. The LEED Silver® hotels comprise a two-hotel complex located in Nashville's famed Lower Broadway entertainment district across the street from Music City Convention Center and near other key points of interest and feature seven food and beverage outlets a spa two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space.



Maui Update

Impacts from the August 2023 wildfires in Maui Hawaii continued into 2024. In the first quarter the Company's Maui hotels and golf courses impacted RevPAR by 170 basis points. Operating profit margin and comparable hotel EBITDA margin were impacted by approximately 50 basis points and 30 basis points respectively for the first quarter. The first quarter impact is understated as the Company would have expected Maui to contribute 140 basis points to portfolio RevPAR growth in the first quarter given the renovation disruption at Fairmont Kea Lani in 2023. As a result the total estimated impact of the wildfires on first quarter RevPAR is 310 basis points.

BALANCE SHEET

This spend is separate from payments for capital expenditures which are considered investing activities.



Under the Hyatt Transformational Capital Program the Company received $2 million of the expected full year $9 million of operating guarantees in the first quarter of 2024 to offset business disruptions.

2024 OUTLOOK

The 2024 guidance range continues to contemplate steady demand in travel and low supply growth. In addition the range incorporates continued improvement in group business a gradual recovery in business transient demand softer short term leisure transient demand and the evolution of demand on Maui as the island recovers from the recent wildfires. Growth in the first half of 2024 is expected to be flat to low single-digits while the second half of the year is expected to have stronger year-over-year improvements due to better group booking pace less renovation disruption compared to the second half of 2023 and diminishing impacts from the wildfire event in Maui which occurred in early August of 2023.

Operating profit margin in 2024 is expected to increase slightly compared to 2023 while comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to decline compared to 2023 due to the impacts from the Maui wildfires and continued growth in wages real estate taxes and insurance. At the midpoint of guidance the impact from the Maui wildfires is expected to be an approximate decline of 130 basis points in RevPAR 90 basis points in Total RevPAR and 20 basis points in margins. At the midpoint in comparison to 2019 operating profit margin is expected to increase 110 basis points and comparable hotel EBITDA margins are expected to increase 10 basis points as portfolio-wide cost reductions continue to curb inflation and benefiting from business interruption gains.

The guidance range for net income and Adjusted EBITDAre includes an additional $28 million of gains from business interruption proceeds compared to prior forecast comprised of $8 million related to Hurricane Ian and based on an estimated range of $18 million to $22 million related to the Maui wildfires which is expected to be received during the remainder of 2024. The guidance also includes an estimated $17 million and $29 million of net income and Adjusted EBITDAre respectively which is expected from the recent acquisition of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown. Due to the timing of the acquisition the results for these two hotels will be included in the comparable hotel guidance starting in the second quarter. Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California in March 2024 Alila Ventana Big Sur temporarily closed on March 30 2024 and will be removed from the forecast comparable hotel set for full year 2024.

The Company anticipates its 2024 operating results as compared to 2023 will be in the following range:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change vs. 2023 Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Comparable hotel Total RevPAR $352 to $359 2.7% to 4.6% 2.9% to 5.8% (60) bps Comparable hotel RevPAR $214 to $218 2.0% to 4.0% 2.5% to 5.5% (100) bps Total revenues under GAAP (in millions) $5650 to $5753 6.4% to 8.3% 5.2% to 8.1% 80 bps Operating profit margin under GAAP 15.4% to 16.1% (20) bps to 50 bps (40) bps to 70 bps (10) bps Comparable hotel EBITDA margin 29.3% to 29.8% (80) bps to (30) bps (120) bps to (40) bps 30 bps

Based upon the above parameters the Company estimates its 2024 guidance as follows:

Current Full Year 2024 Guidance Previous Full Year 2024 Guidance Change in Full Year 2024 Guidance to the Mid-Point Net income (in millions) $719 to $775 $708 to $794 $(4) Adjusted EBITDAre (in millions) $1640 to $1700 $1590 to $1680 $35 Diluted earnings per common share $1.00 to $1.08 $.99 to $1.11 $(0.01) NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share $1.97 to $2.05 $1.92 to $2.04 $0.03

(1) The Forecasts are based on the below assumptions:

Comparable hotel RevPAR will increase 2.0% to 4.0% compared to 2023 for the low and high end of the forecast range. Comparable hotel metrics do not yet include the results of 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown which were acquired in April 2024. We expect to include the comparable hotel results for these two hotels beginning in the second quarter.

Comparable hotel EBITDA margins will decrease 80 basis points to 30 basis points compared to 2023 for the low and high ends of the forecasted comparable hotel RevPAR range respectively.

We expect to spend approximately $500 million to $605 million on capital expenditures.

Includes $17 million of net income and $29 million of EBITDA from the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown acquired in April 2024. Assumes no additional acquisitions and no dispositions during the year.

Assumes a total of $38 million of gains from business interruption proceeds expected to be received in 2024 related to Hurricane Ian and related to the Maui wildfire disruption. No further business interruption gains are expected. Also includes $32 million of insurance proceeds from Hurricane Ian received through May 1 2024 that result in a gain on property insurance settlement. No further property insurance gains have been included related to Hurricane Ian. We have collected $263 million out of a potential $310 million insurance recovery related to Hurricane Ian under our policy and we continue to work with our insurers to recover the remaining amount although there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve this result.

Notes to Financial Information

FORECASTS

Our forecast of net income earnings per diluted share NAREIT and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results are forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results and performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forecasts. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forecasts are based upon reasonable assumptions we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that the results will not be materially different. Risks that may affect these assumptions and forecasts include the following: potential changes in overall economic outlook make it inherently difficult to forecast the level of RevPAR; the amount and timing of debt payments may change significantly based on market conditions which will directly affect the level of interest expense and net income; the amount and timing of transactions involving shares of our common stock may change based on market conditions; and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business described herein and in our annual report on Form 10-K quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC.

COMPARABLE HOTEL OPERATING STATISTICS AND RESULTS

To facilitate a year-to-year comparison of our operations we present certain operating statistics (i.e. Total RevPAR RevPAR average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues expenses hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in our reports on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) are owned or leased by us as of the reporting date and are not classified as held-for-sale; and (ii) have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption or undergone large-scale capital projects in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer (as further defined below) during the reporting periods being compared.

We make adjustments to include recent acquisitions to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. Additionally operating results of hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed or the hotel is classified as held-for-sale.

The hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. Generally hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. A large-scale capital project would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set if it requires the entire property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer.

Similarly hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption if it requires the property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer. In each case these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after the hotel has reopened. Often related to events that cause property damage and the closure of a hotel we will collect business interruption insurance proceeds for the near-term loss of business. These proceeds are included in gain on insurance settlements on our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Business interruption insurance gains related to a hotel that was excluded from our comparable hotel set also will be excluded from the comparable hotel results.

Of the 77 hotels that we owned as of March 31 2024 76 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following properties that we owned as of March 31 2024 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:

The Ritz-Carlton Naples (business disruption due to Hurricane Ian beginning in September 2022 reopened in July 2023); and

Sales and marketing expenses related to the development and sale of condominium units on a development parcel adjacent to Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World® Resort.

Additionally following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California Alila Ventana Big Sur closed on March 30 2024 and has yet to reopen to guests. As a result the property will be removed from the comparable hotel set starting in the second quarter.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. Therefore hotel statistics and results for non-U.S. properties include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Included in this press release are certain “non-GAAP financial measures” which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. They are as follows: (i) FFO and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted) (ii) EBITDA (iii) EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre and (iv) Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results. The following discussion defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance.

NAREIT FFO AND NAREIT FFO PER DILUTED SHARE

We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. As noted in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets gains and losses from change in control impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.

We believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation amortization impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance we believe that such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance.

Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share

We also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of diluted earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:

Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense –In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. For example in 2017 as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and to increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and therefore we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO.

EBITDA

Earnings before Interest Expense Income Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for our compensation programs.

EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the Company’s results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense income tax depreciation and amortization gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control) impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates.

We make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre:

Property Insurance Gains – We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company.

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.

Severance Expense – In certain circumstances we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include but are not limited to (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.

In unusual circumstances we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.

Limitations on the Use of NAREIT FFO per Diluted Share Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre

We calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating profit cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures) interest expense (for EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been and will be made and are not reflected in the EBITDA EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q include interest expense capital expenditures and other excluded items all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally NAREIT FFO per diluted share Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDA EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure and should not be used as measures of amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit.

Similarly EBITDAre Adjusted EBITDAre NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in eight domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 35 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners we do not control and therefore do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in a partnership owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and therefore consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre were calculated as set forth in the definitions above. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities.

Comparable Hotel Property Level Operating Results

We present certain operating results for our hotels such as hotel revenues expenses food and beverage profit and EBITDA (and the related margins) on a comparable hotel or ""same store"" basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our comparable hotel results present operating results for our hotels without giving effect to dispositions or properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage as discussed in “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present comparable hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels after removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. Comparable hotel results are presented both by location and for the Company’s properties in the aggregate. We eliminate from our comparable hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses these non-cash expenses which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.

Because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses gains or losses on disposition certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues expenses operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our condensed consolidated statements of operations include such amounts all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.

We present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons we believe comparable hotel operating results when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit revenues and expenses provide useful information to investors and management.

The acquisition price represents a 12.6x EBITDA multiple or a cap rate of approximately 7.4 percent on the property’s 2024 estimated results. Other terms were not disclosed.

The property is expected to be among Host’s top-25 assets based on estimated full year 2024 results with expected combined RevPAR of $275 total RevPAR of $435 and EBITDA per key of $585502 further improving the quality of the company’s portfolio.

“We are excited to add the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown to our portfolio and establish a presence in one of the country’s most exciting cities"" Host Hotels & Resorts President and CEO James Risoleo said in a statement. ""The newly built property has a prime location in Nashville a top-performing market which had an impressive RevPAR CAGR of 7.7 percent from 2000 to 2023 even while absorbing new supply. A major leisure destination and the #2 ranked convention destination in the United States Nashville also has a recently expanded airport and a new stadium that is expected to attract more entertainment and sporting events. With meaningful in-place cash flow multiple demand generators and no expected near-term capital expenditure requirements we expect the Property will generate outsized growth as it stabilizes enhancing the quality of our portfolio and driving additional value creation for our stockholders.”

The newly built LEED Silver property opened in 2022 and is located two blocks from numerous live music and entertainment venues in Nashville’s famed Lower Broadway entertainment district. The Property stands directly across from the Music City Convention Center adjacent to the Bridgestone arena home of the NHL Nashville Predators and within a 10-minute drive of Nissan Stadium the Country Music Hall of Fame Museum Vanderbilt University Tennessee State University and Centennial Park. The MCCC has continued to set record attendance numbers by attracting larger events and it has promising definite bookings in future years. The new Nissan Stadium home of the NFL Tennessee Titans is also expected to generate increased demand as the stadium’s dome will allow for year-round activation beginning with the 2027 season. In addition the Nashville International Airport is the fastest growing airport in the United States with current passenger traffic 33 percent above 2019. The recent $1.5 billion airport expansion added six international gates and eight satellite gates and another $1.5 billion expansion is already underway with completion expected in 2028.

The Property has a combined 721 oversized rooms that average approximately 500 square feet with a 75 percent suite mix. It offers seven separate food and beverage outlets including Harriet’s Rooftop which provides guests with exclusive views of Music City’s skyline in an elevated nightlife setting. Among other amenities the property has a Bamford Wellness spa with six treatment rooms two fitness centers a yoga studio and 33000 square feet of shared meeting space including a 9400 square foot ballroom and 9300 square feet of pre-function space.

Supply growth is expected to continue in Nashville with most projects in the planning stages and in the select service chain scale. Host believes the Property is differentiated from the future supply as a result of its central location and diversified product offerings that provide distinct value propositions to customers. The company expects the Property to stabilize between approximately 10-12x EBITDA3 in the 2026-2028 time frame.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc3Rhci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNjYxMzU0OC9ob3N0LWhvdGVscy1yZWFkeS10by1idXktd2lsbGluZy10by1raWNrLWRlYWxzLWxvb3Nl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Host Hotels Ready To Buy Willing To 'Kick Deals Loose',"Executives at the largest hospitality-focused public real estate investment trust are itching to spend money this year.

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

HP's shipments grew by 58.7% per cent YoY in CY2021. While the company continues to grow in both the commercial and consumer segment until now the majority of HP's hardware was imported in the country. The American multinational intends to change this with its ""Made in India for India"" plans.

The company has been manufacturing commercial desktops in India for a long time but it has now commenced local manufacturing of laptops in the country.

Laptops including HP's EliteBooks ProBooks and HP G8 series notebooks are being made at the Flex facility in Sriperumbudur near Chennai Tamil Nadu.

This is the first time HP is manufacturing such a wide range of hardware in India.

""We were among the first brands to jump on the Make in India bandwagon in 2007. And we were doing a limited portfolio with limited value addition as we were importing components and assembling them at a period where value additions which were in the range of seven to eight per cent"" Ketan Patel Managing Director HP India Market told Business Today.

""But what we've done in this recent manufacturing upgrade with Flex is making sure we expanded the portfolio from a single desktop form factor to several desktop form factors small form factor mini all-in-one PCs displays and of course laptops"" he added.

In addition to expanding the product categories being manufactured in India HP like many other smartphone OEMs is going beyond just assembly in India to increasing local value addition.

""We are now adding the percentage of value addition so it is no longer just about assembly. We are also doing a local procurement of subcomponents out of India and then adding them to our Make in India portfolio making the value of the product created out of India better than the 7% level which we had in the past. And various products from our side now have a valuation ranging from 10% to 50%. Thus various products at various phases"" explains Patel.

Another change HP brought in is - ""Make in India for India"". Over the past two years the company has learned that there are certain user patterns in India and environmental factors which the company need to be mindful of.

""We can't just take a global product and put it in India. Eventually if we do a great job designing products for India specific design needs they can be leveraged in a lot of other countries with similar environments.

And that will be our endeavour: ensuring that information is transferred within our organisation for some of the lessons learned in this country.""

Some of these products qualify under the public procurement order of the Government and will be available on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) portal to meet the demands of the government departments and other customers.

According to a latest report by IDC HP commands a share of 32.9 per cent and 30 per cent in the commercial and consumer segments in India in 2021. Strong demand coupled with consistent supplies helped the brand in managing substantial growth in both segments.

In our testing the 2022 BMW i4 M50 reached 60 mph in 3.3 seconds which makes it 0.2 second quicker than the M3 Competition.

However the M3 Competition beats it by 0.1 second in the quarter-mile and passes it after 80 mph.



The i4 M50 is the first M-badged electric and it has 536 horsepower from two electric motors. The M3 Competition is the more powerful version of the M3 and it has a 503-hp twin-turbo inline-six.

Welcome to Car and Driver's Testing Hub where we zoom in on the test numbers. We've been pushing vehicles to their limits since 1956 to provide objective data to bolster our subjective impressions (you can see how we test here). A more comprehensive review of the 2022 BMW i4 M50 can be found here.

The 2022 BMW i4 M50 is the brand's first electric vehicle to wear an M badge. Although it isn't a full-blown M car it has what it takes to keep up with top-performing compact sports sedans and coupes from M in a straight line. In Car and Driver testing it outaccelerated the M3 Competition to 60 mph and to little surprise overcame gas-powered ""M lite"" cars such as the M340i and M440i. When it eventually arrives we have no doubt that the first full-M electric car will be a serious performer.

In our testing the i40 M50 reached 60 mph in 3.3 seconds 0.2 second ahead of the rear-wheel-drive M3 Competition and nearly half a second ahead of BMW's initial claim. And that's even with the i4's extra 1243 pounds compared with the M3 Competition on our scales. That's in part from its 81.5-kWh lithium-ion battery pack and two electric motors. One motor powers each axle and the two combine for a total output of 536 horsepower and 586 pound-feet of torque. As the more powerful version of the M3 the Competition model has 503 horsepower and 479 pound-feet of torque from BMW's S58 twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six sent through an eight-speed automatic transmission. An all-wheel-drive M3 Competition is now available and although we haven't strapped our test gear to one yet we expect it to match the i40 M50's performance to 60 mph.

However the M3 Competition displays its horsepower-to-weight advantage and beats the i4 M50 in the quarter-mile. The M3 passes the M50 after 80 mph and blasts through in 11.6 seconds at 124 mph while the i4 is 0.1 second behind and traveling 4 mph slower. The i4 M50 takes advantage of its all-wheel drive and the instant torque from its electric motors though going from 5 to 60 mph 1.0 second quicker than the M3. Our test results also show the gap in passing speeds with the M3 requiring an additional 0.9 second to go from 30 to 50 mph and an extra 0.7 second to get from 50 to 70 mph.

The M3 Competition is more capable in corners achieving 1.03 g's on the skidpad compared to the i4 M50's 0.97 g. The M3 was equipped with Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires while the i4 M50 arrived with Pirelli P Zero Elect PZ4 rubber. Its lateral grip puts it more in line with the M340i which had a max cornering capability of 0.96 g in our testing and was also equipped with Pilot Sport 4S tires like the M3. At our 15th annual Lightning Lap event we lapped the M3 Competition xDrive around Virginia International Raceway's Grand Course in 2:53.5.

The 2022 BMW i4 M50's $66895 starting price is a relative bargain for what you get in terms of performance as the M3 Competition costs $7100 more. Sure you can't get a purist rear-drive and manual transmission setup in the i4 like our long-term M3 test car but the numbers speak for themselves. We can't wait to see what the eventual full-M electric models will be capable of at the test track. Check back for our full test and review of the i4 M50 soon.

If you're yet to set up a PayPal account  this may well be the first question you ask. But even if you're one of the company's 392 million active users you could still be wondering if your financial data is being kept secure and whether you're at risk of fraud and identity theft.

PayPal was founded in 1998 and it certainly created a well-tested and highly-trusted online payments system during that time. Lots of major brands use PayPal for their online payments and it's regularly used to transfer money between friends and family. Most people have also come across it when buying items on eBay. But is it really one of the safest ways to conduct a transaction?

How does PayPal secure transactions?

(Image credit: PayPal)

When you enter the details of your bank account credit card or debit card (depending on what you want on file) the data is encrypted and stored in PayPal's secure database. Since this is a single online vault your financial data is only kept in one place rather than across multiple locations. It is regarded as a safer way of retaining your information.

Any transaction you make is also secure. When paying for an item your financial details are never shared. A seller or someone you're transferring money to will never ever see the numbers of your bank or card accounts. That's one of the main points of PayPal — the fact you don't share actual financial information with sellers or people you transfer money to.

What's more all transactions are encrypted at both ends using secure sockets layer (SSL) protocol technology with 128-bit encryption. And as a back-up every transaction is monitored for anything suspicious day and night. If anything is flagged as odd a member of PayPal's team is alerted and this helps to protect against email phishing identify theft and fraud.

Are users protected if something goes wrong?

(Image credit: Future)

It's all very well having a secure financial system but that in itself doesn't protect you if the person you're sending money to turns out to be dodgy. You could legitimately use PayPal to buy an item through an encrypted transaction only to discover the recipient doesn't intend to send the goods or ends up shipping something of poor quality.

In such a situation PayPal should have your back thanks to Buyer Protection. We say “should” because not all transactions qualify (you're not covered if you buy a vehicle real estate industrial machinery or pre-paid cards for instance nor items that violate PayPal's policies). You also need to open a dispute in the PayPal Resolution Center within 180 days of the purchase or payment but it's a nice safeguard nonetheless. If PayPal finds in your favor you will be refunded.

Am I protected if I send money to friends and family?

(Image credit: Future)

PayPal can be used to transfer money to people you know using the PayPal Friends and Family option. The transactions are just as safe as if you're making a purchase online and they don't attract any fees (unless you're sending international personal transactions).

You may however encounter sellers asking you to pay for items and services using the Friends and Family option. Don't! Sellers will be trying to avoid paying PayPal's business transaction fees and while they may tempt you by offering a small discount be aware that you won't have Buyer Protection. Those transactions should instead always be conducted via the PayPal Goods and Services option.

What if I am selling something?

Again the transaction will be safe and secure — you won't see the buyer's financial details and they certainly won't see your's. PayPal will protect you if payment has been sent without authorization from a hacked account for instance or if a buyer claims they did not receive the item you sent. So long as you have proof that you sent an item and that it was received you're eligible for Seller Protection.

Should I use a credit card with PayPal?

(Image credit: Pixabay)

If you can yes. Although credit card protections don't apply if you're using them via online payment systems such as PayPal if anything does go wrong you at least have the option of seeing if your credit card company can help.

By using a credit card you are also distancing PayPal from accounts that potentially contain a large amount of cash. You'll likely find it easier to sort unauthorized payments made through a credit card than you would if someone ended up taking money from your bank account. And money swiped out of a bank account could land you in a heap of trouble if it leads to missed mortgage payments and so on.

How can I make using PayPal even safer?

You should also use a complex password rather than something easily guessable and safeguard your login further by registering your mobile phone to use a PayPal Security Key — otherwise known as two-factor authorization . When you login to your PayPal account a PIN will be sent to your mobile and this adds an extra layer of security.

Regularly check the email address associated with PayPal too. Emails are sent whenever a transaction is made and if anything looks odd you can report it with a view to be refunded.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbWFydHlzd2FudC8yMDIyLzAyLzI2L3dpdGgtdWtyYWluZS11bmRlci1hdHRhY2stdGhlLXNwb3J0cy13b3JsZC1jdXRzLXRpZXMtd2l0aC1ydXNzaWFuLXNwb25zb3JzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With Ukraine Under Attack The Sports World Cuts Ties With Russian Sponsors,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/martyswant/2022/02/26/with-ukraine-under-attack-the-sports-world-cuts-ties-with-russian-sponsors/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbWFydHlzd2FudC8yMDIyLzAyLzI2L3dpdGgtdWtyYWluZS11bmRlci1hdHRhY2stdGhlLXNwb3J0cy13b3JsZC1jdXRzLXRpZXMtd2l0aC1ydXNzaWFuLXNwb25zb3JzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9jaGV2eS1jb2xvcmFkby16cjItdHJhbnNmb3JtZWQtaW50by03NTAtaHAtdHJ4LWZpZ2h0ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chevy Colorado ZR2 Transformed Into 750-HP TRX Fighter,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYnV6ei5jb20vbmV3cy9jaGV2eS1jb2xvcmFkby16cjItdHJhbnNmb3JtZWQtaW50by03NTAtaHAtdHJ4LWZpZ2h0ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

TCF Bank and Huntington Bank were already among the market leaders in Michigan ranking sixth and seventh respectively in deposit market share as of 2020.

Combining the two banks in a $22 billion deal that closed June 9 2021 elevated Huntington Bank to second statewide in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s 2021 Summary of Deposits with $40.81 billion in Michigan deposits as of midyear for a nearly 13.1-percent market share.

The TCF-Huntington merger was named the winner in MiBiz’s 2022 M&A Deals and Dealmakers of the Year Awards in the Finance/Banking category.

In an October conference call with analysts to discuss quarterly results Huntington Bancshares Chairman President and CEO Steve Steinour said the bank had “density in Michigan that’s significant to us” although the merger did lead to the closing or consolidation of numerous redundant branches.

Even with the office consolidations plus the sale of 14 branches that federal regulators required as a condition for approving the deal Huntington still has the largest branch network in Michigan with more than 300 offices.

finance/banking HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES INC. Top executives: Steve Steinour chairman president and CEO; Krista Flynn West Michigan regional president Annual sales: $1.29 billion in 2021 net income Total Michigan employees: 1500 Company description: Regional bank Advisers on the deal: Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (financial) and Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz (legal) to Huntington. Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. (financial) and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP (legal) to TCF

“From an access standpoint we are everywhere” said Krista Flynn Huntington Bank’s regional president for the West Michigan market. “Now it’s like you can’t really go too many miles without seeing a Huntington branch. Having access for our clients I do think the coverage map matters.”

Huntington gained stronger positions particularly in rural markets in Michigan where TCF formerly had offices Flynn said.

In the Grand Rapids area which is Michigan’s second largest market Huntington solidified its position as the second-largest bank with $5.88 billion in deposits for a nearly 19.5-percent market share.

The combination with TCF also made Huntington Bancshares (Nasdaq: HBAN) a top-25 bank in the U.S. with $174 billion in assets and $143.2 billion in deposits at the end of 2021. Following the merger Huntington operates today with dual headquarters with commercial banking operations based in Detroit and consumer banking headquartered in Columbus.

The merger which closed six months after it was publicly announced in December 2020 extended Huntington’s footprint further across the Midwest to 12 states and introduced new services — particularly digital banking products — to TCF customers and small business lending backed by the U.S. Small Business Administration.

“Huntington brings an expanded set of capabilities to these markets and to the TCF customer base including middle market and corporate banking with specialty verticals treasury management capital markets trust and investment and insurance products in addition to our No. 1-in-the-nation SBA lending program” Steinour said in a July conference call with analysts.

The merger has been “a great complement and (provided) great additive features to a lot of our clients that are now exposed to an ability to invest more in digital and that sort of thing” Flynn said.

Through the merger Huntington can better spread the costs to invest in technology she said. The deal enabled Huntington to invest an additional $170 million in digital banking technologies and services.

“In the banking industry there really is something to be said about scale. It just allows us to spread those investments across a much larger client base” Flynn said. “Bigger for the sake of bigger is not what it’s all about. It’s having the resources to invest and spread those investment costs out.”

A week after the merger closed Huntington announced a five-year $40 billion Community Plan to address social racial environmental and economic inequities in the markets it serves.

Given Huntington’s new market size in the state and after an integration period to bring TCF into Huntington Flynn doesn’t see another merger coming that will affect the bank’s Michigan market. The merger into Huntington came together less than 18 months after TCF formerly based in Minneapolis merged with the former Chemical Financial Corp. which had gone through a series of mergers and acquisitions over the years.

“Overall it’s a big change for clients that have been through a number of mergers and we think from an overlap standpoint and in the Michigan market this should be our last one” Flynn said. “There is some stability that they won’t have to go through another systems change for example. I think it’s comforting to our clients that now they’re in a bank of size they won’t have to worry about what’s next.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Every Saturday we’ll be spotlighting a different episode of television from that week that we thought was exceptional and a must-see. Check back to see if your favorite show got the nod — or to learn about a new one! Spoilers ahead.

Ming-Na Wen is used to playing steely warriors on screen. She’s been the voice of Mulan in the 1998 film Agent Melinda May in Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and most recently assassin Fennec Shand in the Star Wars Disney+ series The Book of Boba Fett. And yet she’s never been more in control than as Dr. Carol Lee in this week’s episode of CBS’s Young Sheldon which aired on February 24.

Sheldon (Iain Armitage) is used to being able to drive the adults around him crazy enough to get his way but one person he can’t shake is the completely unflappable Dr. Lee. With the infighting between Dr. Linkletter (Ed Begley Jr.) and Dr. Sturgis (Wallace Shawn) in the lab where Sheldon works President Hagemeyer (Wendie Malick) assigns Dr. Lee as project leader to restore order and she certainly is qualified for the task. “I have a PHD in physics from Berkley I worked at IBM’s Watson Research Center as lead of the materials research group and I raised three little boys which I understand you’ve been acting like” she says with a smile to the chagrined trio. With the electric guitar in the background the stylish grey pants-suit Dr. Lee is wearing and Wen’s smooth delivery it’s an impressive introduction. All I could think about while watching the scene: I want Dr. Lee around all the time.

Sturgis and Linkletter are clearly as impressed by her as I am and they pretty immediately fall in line. Who can blame them as Dr. Lee tells amazing stories like doing an experiment in the middle of an earthquake and jokes with them in other languages about what it would take to make Sheldon stop talking–Mandarin with Sturgis and French with Linkletter. The only one not charmed is Sheldon who only sees someone who isn’t taking his ideas seriously.

When Sheldon goes to her office to complain Wen somehow manages to pull off an air of both maternal patience and disdain towards Sheldon. She calmly tells him that she’s taking everyone’s ideas into consideration and only wants what’s best for the project but throws some serious shade when Sheldon pushes back telling him “no” in Klingon explaining that she looked up how to say that one word because she “had a feeling it would come in handy.” Even Wen’s facial expressions seamlessly merge from stern to an amused smugness.

When Sheldon gets mischievous and breaks into Dr. Lee’s office to replace her coordinates for the telescope with his own we learn he has truly met his match. The scene is perfectly paired with a chat between Dr. Lee and President Hagemeyer about how hard it is to be a woman in the sciences. Just as Dr. Lee explains that she’s designed Home Alone-style boobie traps to protect her work Sheldon is hit with spray paint his picture is taken and an alarm goes off when he tries to get into Dr. Lee’s computer. It’s a scene worth the rewatch just to watch Sheldon’s stunned face.

Unfortunately Wen has confirmed that so far she isn’t scheduled to return in more episodes but she definitely wants to come back. Hopefully the series’ creative team realizes her character is a huge success and makes immediate plans to write Dr. Lee more great storylines.

Other observations we thought made this episode stand out:

The B-plot this episode has Missy (Raegan Revord) and George Sr. (Lance Barber) trying to convince the piously Christian Mary (Zoe Perry) to cash-in a winning lottery ticket. The storyline is entertaining enough but its true shining moment comes at the end of the episode when the whole family–minus a scoffing Missy–stand around watching the dishwasher they bought with the money. They ooh and ah over every new stage of the rinse cycle each small beep and Sheldon’s reading of ‘fun facts’ from the instruction manual. It’s the little things in life that are the most satisfying.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jcm4uY29tLmF1L25ld3MvcGVydGhzLXNpbHZlcmZlcm4taXQtdGFwcy1leC1leS1jYXBnZW1pbmktdGFsZW50LW1pY2hhZWwtZW5nLWFzLWRpZ2l0YWwtdHJhbnNmb3JtYXRpb24tYW5kLXNlY3VyaXR5LWJvc3MtNTc2NTY30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Perth's Silverfern IT taps ex-EY Capgemini talent Michael Eng as digital transformation and security boss,"Perth managed services provider Silverfern IT has added a new senior executive with the appointment of a new company director Michael Eng.

Eng who was hired from big four consulting firm EY will lead Silverfern IT’s digital transformation and cybersecurity business.

Silverfern IT managing director Liong Eng said Michael Eng (his son) will also be tasked to help the senior leadership team grow the business as well as managing the company’s new security operations centre (SOC).

Eng was most recently a manager for technology consulting and financial services advisory at EY Australia from 2019 to May 2021. Prior to that he was a senior consultant at Capgemini Invent from 2017 to 2019. He also worked at Silverfern IT from 2015 to 2017 as a consultant and at MLC as IT consultant from 2014 to 2016.

Eng’s hiring also comes as Silverfern launches its new SOC supported by a new managed security service based on IBM Security’s technology.

The service uses IBM’s QRadar Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and IBM Security QRadar SOAR software solutions.

Speaking to CRN Liong Eng said the service is targeted specifically to small businesses that struggle to find the right cybersecurity resources and for those who want more clarity of what’s happening in their IT environments.

“The key reason why we set up the SOC is that we’ve started seeing many organisations facing increased cybersecurity threats over the years which has been exacerbated by the pandemic and working from home becoming more common” Eng said.

“It’s a great opportunity and time for Silverfern IT to start a SOC powered by IBM Security which in our opinion is the best in the marketplace as confirmed by its position in the Gartner Magic Quadrant.

“We’re taking a world-class security solution to our customers which often include SMBs who would usually not be able to afford an enterprise-class SIEM.”

The SOC is also managed by a team of security professionals and hosted at NextDC’s P2 data centre running on IBM’s enterprise-class storage servers switches and more.

Eng said there was a hole in the cybersecurity space specifically for SMBs that also run into similar security challenges as enterprises and being able to bring IBM Security at a more affordable cost would make the solution an attractive option for those customers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuYWx5dGljc2luc2lnaHQubmV0L3RvcC0xMC1jb21wYW5pZXMtYnVpbGRpbmctYWktc3VwZXJjb21wdXRlcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 Companies Building AI Supercomputers,With artificial intelligence in place organizations are in a position to perceive understand process and respond to inputs to be able to generate the desired results.

INTERROGAZIONE DI LONARDO: ATTIVARE SUBITO I CORRIDOI UMANITARI

“Ho presentato oggi (ieri ndr) in Senato una interrogazione parlamentare al Ministro degli Affari Esteri e della Cooperazione Internazionale Luigi Di Maio ed al Ministro dell’Interno Luciana Lamorgese per chiedere l’attivazione urgente di corridoi umanitari per i parenti che ne facciano richiesta dei cittadini ucraini regolarmente residenti sul territorio nazionale. Numerose infatti sono le richieste di aiuto da parte dei cittadini ucraini soggiornanti in Italia inerenti la possibilità di fare giungere qui i propri genitori figli fratelli per fuggire da una situazione di pericolo in ragione delle note vicende che coinvolgono il Paese.

Ecco perché ritengo che sia quantomai necessario in questo momento storico riconoscere loro il diritto al rilascio di un visto umanitario; e non si tratta del riconoscimento in via generale ed astratta a ricorrere al VTL al fine di consentire di presentare domanda di protezione internazionale in uno stato UE ma del ricorso ad uno strumento fondato sulle previsioni di un Regolamento Europeo che viene utilizzato al fine specifico di scongiurare una eccezionale documentata e peculiare situazione di imminente pericolo di violazione dei diritti umani fondamentali nel quale si deve individuare uno dei motivi umanitari richiamati dalla normativa eurocomunitaria”.

I Neon Led di Neonflexmood vanno ad abbellire il set di un format davvero azzeccato tanto da essere giunto alla seconda edizione in cui e qui sta il segreto vince chi riesce a resistere a non ridere. Ed infatti il titolo originale della trasmissione è “LOL: chi ride è fuori” in cui i VIP si sfidano a rimanesse impassibili e quindi non ridere davanti ad esilaranti gag comiche.

In questa seconda edizione c’è ancora al timone della conduzione Fedez il quale viene accompagnato da Frank Matano che come si suole dire passa dall’altra parte della barricata dopo essere stato uno dei concorrenti nella prima edizione.

Il duo Fedez-Matano dalla control room vigila sui concorrenti per scovare chi si lascerà andare ad una fatale risata di fronte alle provocazioni comiche degli altri concorrenti; l’eliminazione ricordiamolo avviene alla seconda risata.

Ma chi sono questi VIP che dovranno essere così forti a non ridere? Virginia Raffaele Mago Forest Tess Masazza Maccio Capatonda Alice Mangione Gianmarco Pozzoli Corrado Guzzanti Max Angioni Maria Di Biase e Diana Del Bufalo si contenderanno un montepremi finale di 100mila euro da devolvere intarmante ad un ente di beneficenza scelto dal trionfatore. Guest star di questa seconda edizione è Lillo Petrolo in veste di “arma segreta” in mano a Fedez e Frank Matano per far capitolare a suon di risate i concorrenti.

According to the company the appointments will allow it to better serve consumers in providing sorting solutions and technical support.

Two new senior managers have been added to the company’s existing roles and two new positions have been created increasing the company’s senior management team to eight. All appointments will be in effect this month.

Karel Strubbe has been promoted to TOMRA Processed Food’s head of global sales. Since starting his career with TOMRA Food in 2007 Strubbe served as area sales manager aiding in the company’s operational needs.

Vera Boon has been appointed to head of service. Prior to TOMRA Processed Food Boon served as global services leader at Ingersoll Rand which provides mission-critical air fluid energy specialty vehicle and medical technology.

Kris De Smart has been appointed to head of product management. Smart has experience in directing product management in security and video surveillance and previously served as product management leader for video at GE Security.

Vanessa Sibenaler has joined the TOMRA Processed Food team as head of people and organization. Sibenaler previously served as human resources director of Additives International a sector of ITW manufacturer of specialty research chemicals for automotive. She has served as human resources director eastern hemisphere for T.D. Williamson a pipeline equipment company.

According to TOMRA Processed Food’s Chief Executive Officer Ken Moynihan these appointments result from an internal review of the business.

""The future of food processing will be more complex and sophisticated as we support our customers to increase yields and quality to meet growing demand” Moynihan said. “These changes will demand sensing and sorting technology innovations artificially intelligent self-optimizing lines and digitally connected data-driven support services. TOMRA will be a leader in this transformation ensuring our customers stay at the forefront of these exciting changes and opportunities and operate at their full capability every hour every day all year round.

""To lead the way we need a strong innovative and customer-centric organization that understands our customers intimately; feels their pain and shares in their successes and is driven to innovate and create new solutions that take our customers into their future” he added. “After a year evaluating the organization listening to our customers and our people we have set our strategy and now taken the first steps toward that future with these four new appointments.""

TOMRA Food reorganized its business in 2021 separating fresh food and processed food and appointed Moynihan to chief executive officer of TOMRA Processed Food.

""As a global business it is essential that our leaders have wide-reaching global experience and a deep understanding of our customers so we can grow together” Moynihan said. “Our customers know their businesses better than anybody else but we know the most effective technical solutions for their businesses better than anybody else. Put those two abilities together and magic happens.

""We are going to move further and faster along our path from being a global technology provider to being a global solutions provider leading the industry by creating new value for all our customers and ensuring their plants run at maximum efficiency 24 hours per day seven days per week” he added.

The question came in: “Are the Dell PowerSwitch using Xeon Platinums better than the Megatrands generation?” Such a simple question sent us searching for answers. It appears as though we have an answer for our readers.

Dell EMC PowerSwitch Line is Not Using Intel Xeon Platinum

Dell EMC is advertising Intel Xeon Platinum inside as part of its PowerSwitch line. Here is the PowerSwitch page:

One can see the “Intel Xeon Platinum Inside” logo on the right hand of this image. When one drills down into the PowerSwitch Z-series the Intel Xeon Platinum logo is again present.

On the PowerSwitch S-series one can see the Intel Xeon Platinum logo again:

There is a bit of a difference between those logos as on the specific product pages they do not use the “Inside” logo as the switch overview page does.

We have already looked at the Dell EMC S5248F-ON Dell S5296F-ON Dell S5232F-ON and showed in the Megatrands piece that we also have already looked at the S5224F-ON (review is coming later.) All of those use the Intel Atom C3000 series Denverton CPU and that is a big upgrade over the Dell S5148F-ON with the Atom C2000 series Rangely. The question was then what about the new switches the S5448F-ON and the Z9432F-ON. Are they using Intel Xeon Platinum since they are the only logical choice?

We dug into the Z9432F-ON switch spec sheet and found that it is using an Intel Atom C3758.

Also the S5448F-ON switch spec sheet says it is using the Atom C3758.

As such it seems as though Dell is not using an Intel Xeon Platinum CPU in the switches despite using the Intel Xeon Platinum Inside logo.

We think that the answer is instead in the chassis switches using a bit of a stretch.

The Dell EMC PowerEdge Modular System switches show the Dell EMC PowerEdge MX we reviewed. As a blade server there are switches in the same chassis as the compute nodes. We looked through all of the spec sheets and the Dell page here and none of these said “Intel” so we do not know the exact CPUs.

We looked through all of the spec sheets and the Dell page here and none of these said “Intel” so we do not know the exact CPUs. Given the airflow and the general goal of chassis switch management planes it is more likely that these use an embedded processor rather than an Intel Xeon Platinum.

The only Intel reference was the Intel Xeon Platinum logo at the top of the page. Note this is not the “Inside” logo.

Our best guess is that Dell should be using the Atom inside logo not the Platinum inside logo. The products on the PowerSwitch page do not contain Intel Xeon Platinum CPUs. The PowerEdge MX can use Xeon Platinum but not inside the actual switches that are being referenced on the page.

Final Words

Although we have not looked at Dell’s newest switches yet what we have seen and what we can gather from spec pages seems like despite using Intel’s Xeon Platinum Inside logo these switches do not use the Xeon Platinum processors. Again in this instance that is a good thing since typically the Atom and Xeon D lines are used since embedded processors are a better fit for this application.

For our readers hopefully this clears up the confusion using the Intel Xeon Platinum Inside logo here caused. At some point Dell’s competitors will probably bring this to Intel since usually using those logos has an MDF implication. At that point there is a good chance we will see them updated. At least STH readers will know the answer without having to wait.

Update: Dell responded to STH in mid-March and confirmed it was using the Intel Xeon Platinum Inside in error. It says that it has remedied the issue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbmRvd3NjZW50cmFsLmNvbS9pbnRlbC1hbWQtcnVzc2lhLXNhbmN0aW9ucy1iYW4tY2hpcHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD and Intel reportedly are suspending processor shipments for industrial use to Russia,"What you need to know

A new report claims Intel and AMD are suspending sales of industrial processors to Russia.

The companies would be following new rules set by OFAC and BIS on selling technology to Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine.

The ban would not apply to consumer devices.

TSMC which manufactures Russian-design chips reportedly complies with new export control rules against Russia.

A new report from RBC claims Intel and AMD have ""verbally informed Russian manufacturers"" that both companies are complying with a ban on the supply of processors to Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. That ban on technology and exports is set to take effect on March 3 although the reporting by RBC suggests Intel and AMD have already halted supplies.

Additionally according to RBC partners in China have been informed by Intel's local office about the ban on the supply of processors to Russia.

The information aligns with recent sanctions imposed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). For its reporting RBC relied on two sources in the IT market but further confirmed the news with a ""representative of the Association of Russian Developers and Electronics Manufacturers (ARPE).""

An Intel spokesperson in Russia did respond to RBC and stated ""the company is closely monitoring the situation and ensuring compliance with applicable sanctions and export control regulations including new sanctions imposed by OFAC and rules issued by the BIS."" BIS is the Bureau of Industry and Security under the U.S. Department of Commerce.

However if accurate it's important to note that Intel and AMD's ban of chip shipments to Russia does not involve ""consumer communication devices"" including personal computers mobile phones digital cameras and more. Instead the ban on importation and sale of processors only applies to industrial usage by either private companies government entities or those expressly sanctioned by the U.S. government ""including the president prime minister deputy prime ministers federal ministers State Duma deputies and members of the Federation Council editors-in-chief and deputy editors-in-chief of state media.""

The ban could significantly hurt Russia's economy in the long run as companies won't be able to upgrade replace or expand server usage for cloud computing and data storage. The same applies to the use of ""supercomputers"" for heavy data processing. Exceptions could be made if companies apply for and are approved for export licenses but that process could drag on for months or longer.

Interestingly Russia has a growing processor business of its own including the MCST Elbrus-8C server CPU. Still it has been panned by critics as ""very weak"" compared to Intel's Xeon 'Cascade Lake' processor. Moreover like many microprocessor companies the Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies (MCST) does not make chips but instead only designs them. Taiwan's TSMC is the manufacturer of the Elbrus and in a Reuters report TSMC noted it would comply with new export control rules on Russia jeopardizing that backup plan. However as of now the chip foundry has not officially told Russian authorities that it will block the production of Russian processors.

If the ban takes effect it remains to be seen what other routes Russia could take to procure processors. Going through China seems the most apparent path especially since both countries have a close strategic alliance. Nonetheless even going through backchannels and leveraging re-export maneuvers prices for such components could surge by 30% for Russian companies to obtain such technology according to RBC.

Questions also remain on the distinction between consumer and industrial use of devices including pre-assembled computers and how U.S. companies will navigate the sanctions.

NVIDIA one of the world's largest and most significant suppliers of GPUs for services AI and industrial use has so far not commented on the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)'s new rules. Similar calls for Microsoft to ban the exportation of software to Russia have also been made although the company has had no comment thus far.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzkzNTYyLWludGVsLWRpZG50LWRyb3AtZGF5LW9uZS1kcml2ZXJzLWVsZGVuLXJpbmcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel didn't drop its day-one drivers for Elden Ring,"Facepalm: Some launch day bugs are causing problems for Elden Ring players so its publisher Bandai Namco is reminding players to update to the latest graphics drivers. But owners of Intel GPUs can't do that because Intel still hasn't released its day-one drivers.

Can any Intel GPUs run Elden Ring? No according to the game's system requirements which mandate a GTX 1060 or RX 580 at a minimum and none of Intel's integrated GPUs come close to that level of performance. Even after Bandai Namco warned players of performance issues and urged them to update their GPU drivers Intel's first discrete solutions aren't due until next month.

We apologize for the delay in providing an update on the driver for Elden Ring. We've found a late breaking incompatibility in the game and we're working diligently with the developer to resolve it. --- Intel Graphics (@IntelGraphics) February 25 2022

Missing drivers is a pretty lousy misstep considering that Intel partnered with Bandai Namco to develop day-one graphics drivers and advertised it all over Twitter. Intel even made a dedicated webpage for the partnership. Under where it says ""enter the vast world of excitement with Intel Day-0 graphics driver support on February 24"" is a link to a graphics driver from November.

Intel Graphics apologized on Twitter today in response to criticism. There's still no word on the driver's precise release date but we'll update you when something changes. In the meantime be thankful that at least Intel didn't make the mistake of releasing a broken driver---I'm looking at you Polaris-era AMD---and is instead making sure that it's polished.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdhcmthZHZvY2F0ZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8yMDIyLzAyLzI3L3BsYXR0LXdlLWFsbC1wbGF5LXBhcnQtd2VsY29taW5nLTIwLWJpbGxpb24taW50ZWwtaW52ZXN0bWVudC82ODk1OTI5MDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Platt: With Intel amongst us we all play a part in welcoming $20 billion investment,"Rick Platt

“What’s the 'blue light special?'”

As an economic development guy I was horrified at the thought of all that could go wrong. Walmart executives lacking a local Walmart store to stop at in Steubenville in 2001 went to the local Kmart to get a feel for the workforce and community. They asked one worker to explain this technique for sparking impulse buying amongst Kmart shoppers.

It was as if the fate of hundreds of jobs in eastern Ohio rested in the hands of one person. That’s because it did.

I witnessed as the gentleman was respectful and more than happy to explain. He did a great job. Little did he know what role he played and if he had had a bad day or behaved differently how he could have turned the story for the worse.

Three months later the community would receive the incredible economic news that a new $75 million Walmart Food Distribution Center would be built. Today it’s the largest economic base employer with 800 employees in Jefferson County Ohio.

It’s always been my personal example of how everyone in the community has a role in economic development. Everyone.

I have some new stories on the heels of this recent Intel announcement. Intel is amongst us.

A visitor to a local museum questioned his host about natural sites and the history of Licking County. After the Intel announcement went off last month the host connected the dots: the visitor was identified as working with Intel and have Licking County connections.

The informal tour and chance encounter could have been a turning point.

Just a few days into the new year a big bus stopped at the Midland Theater and other venues in Newark. Mine was the only local familiar face. No names were shared. No corporate wear was spotted. No business cards were handed out. I’m sure many wondered what was going on. The bus was the event crew for Intel and state officials scouting out locations for a then-upcoming announcement.

Though the deal was a done deal the announcement venue was certainly not decided. All local stops showed the sort of capability that has long been our county’s mantra—big enough to have the resources yet small enough to care about one company at a time.

The rest as they say is history. The Midland and Newark will be forever associated with Intel and the day Ohio’s largest economic development project ever was announced.

What happened between June and January that could have been our local equivalent of the ""blue light special"" quiz? A shopper at Granville Milling in Johnstown. A pet owner at the Kennel Club in Jersey Township. Hikers at Blackhand Gorge. Guests at Cherry Valley Hotel. There have been numerous past encounters that could have been the turning point too.

There will be more in the future.

The role we all play in economic development will continue. The community has the opportunity to capitalize on the $20 billion Intel news gain on Intel’s plans to grow their investment to $100 billion and attract supplier facilities. It will take all of us.

Cohan On Peter Tuchman Wall Street Enigma,"If you’ve ever flipped on CNBC on one of those gloomy days when the stock markets are tanking you’ve seen Peter Tuchman. He’s the fellow with the navy-blue jacket Hermès tie silver goatee and the wild-ass protrusions of white hair on either side of his bald pate that give him more than a passing resemblance to a cross between Albert Einstein and what Larry Fine would look like if the Three Stooges were still in circulation.

He’s the one the cable-TV cameras like to focus on the number 588 pinned to his lapel looking particularly concerned standing on the well-trodden floor of the New York Stock Exchange even though in his 35 years as a floor broker he’s never owned a share of stock. He has been called the “most photographed man on Wall Street.”

And things are looking down: Tuchman on March 9 2020 during the early days of the pandemic.

Tuchman has certainly lived through more than his share of drama down at the left ventricle of capitalism. A year after he started came Black Monday when the Dow Jones Industrial Average collapsed 22.6 percent in one trading day on October 19 1987. He was there for the Credit Crunch of the early 1990s; the demise of the once-powerful hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in the late 1990s; the bursting of the Internet bubble in April 2000; the tragedy of September 11; and the financial crisis of 2008.

Tuchman watched as the hordes of (mostly) male floor brokers scurrying around from trading station to trading station gave way to computerized trading and the transformation of the floor of the exchange into what looks more like a Disney soundstage than it does anything else. On many days it seems the only people panicking on the floor are the disoriented guests hoping to make it to CNBC or Fox Business in time for their afternoon hits.

He’s watched as the exchange itself morphed from a 205-year-old private partnership owned by those with “seats”—brokers used to trade sitting down as difficult as that may be to believe—to a publicly traded company and was eventually owned by something called the Intercontinental Exchange or ICE with a market value of around $72 billion these days and whose billionaire founder Jeffrey Sprecher is married to former U.S. senator Kelly Loeffler.

Tuchman whom BuzzFeed dubbed “the Most Photographed Trader on Wall Street” works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange near an area where various television stations run their broadcasts.

Then came the pandemic which really gave Tuchman the child of Holocaust survivors a Job-like test. For starters the virus nearly killed him. It was early March 2020. His father had just died and he decided to take his son who works with him now skiing in Vail which had been a Tuchman-family tradition for 40 years. With the first rumblings of trouble with the virus beginning to circulate more widely he wondered if he should just cancel the skiing trip. But he decided to go.

They spent five days in Vail. There was a woman on the plane who was breathing on him. A few days later he was feeling sick. “I knew the minute I got it” he tells me during a pre-Omicron interview on a balcony overlooking the floor of the stock exchange. He had a fever of 103.7 degrees for three and a half weeks. He had meningitis. He temporarily lost 80 percent of his memory. He developed severe connective-tissue disease. He had tumors in his feet. He still can’t taste and has trouble swallowing.

A cross between Albert Einstein and what Larry Fine would look like if the Three Stooges were still in circulation.

He’s had seven surgeries to rebuild his cervical spine which collapsed because of the meningitis. Tuchman had the coronavirus for nearly five months. The exchange referred him to two Chinese doctors. He never went to the hospital. “There were nights I was probably hours away from dying” he recalls. “I couldn’t breathe.” Some doctor friends coached him regularly about how to get on his knees to expand his lung capacity to sufficiently take in air. He didn’t get a negative coronavirus test until the fourth quarter of 2020. He survived.

These days more than a year after his ordeal Tuchman seems the very picture of health with a radiating infectious kinetic energy. He’s decided to put his new lease on life to good use. Unlike many of his peers he’s embracing the new generation of day traders that the pandemic swept into the stock markets through trading platforms such as Robinhood and information exchanges such as Wall Street Bets on Reddit. He’s not quite sure he understands the logic driving up the so-called meme stocks such as GameStop AMC even Tesla. But he likes the enthusiasm the new traders have for stocks and for trading.

Tuchman’s NFT with the Wall Street Bulls.

“What ended up happening was this incredible democratization of the trading community” Tuchman explains to me. “All those barriers to entry that used to make one an accredited investor or not are suddenly gone. Everyone with 10 bucks and an iPhone can trade the market. Well that’s unheard of. That’s never happened in our 100 years of trading.”

He wanted to use his understanding of the markets to inform the newbies about the excitement of the markets—as well as about their dangers. He had no axe to grind. He just had his wisdom to impart: Stocks can go down as well as go up. No one ever went broke taking a profit. Just because you buy a stock at $30 a share and it goes up to nearly $500 a share doesn’t mean it’s going to go to the moon. Trees don’t grow to the sky. “Executing a losing trade is just as important as executing a winning trade” he explains. “Most people are really getting hurt here.”

He worries that as usual the media is focusing on “the guys with stacks of thousands on their Bugatti who bought GameStop at two and sold it at 300” and that we’re not hearing about the 90 percent of the day traders who “mortgaged their grandmother’s house” and then “blew it up” and now are broke “because they don’t understand how the market works.”

He teamed up with a longtime friend trader David Green whom Tuchman has known since 1985 to create the Wall Street Global Trading Academy. For $499 Tuchman and Green impart their trading knowledge in a six-hour course and offer up weekly Zoom sessions to answer questions review trades and provide mentorship.

Money makes friends! Tuchman in 2015 with Sports Illustrated swimsuit models Hailey Clauson Sara Sampaio Kelly Rohrbach and Erin Heatherton.

“These kids are not degenerates” Tuchman continues. “They’re just young inexperienced people who have seen some really cool opportunity out here. And it behooves me as somebody who’s been around for a long time to embrace them educate them curate them. How cool would it be if this will be the next generation of people who become responsible traders?” He wants the story of the influx of new traders into the financial markets to have a happy ending. “I don’t want you to come to my party get drunk and get sick and then leave blaming me that I gave you too much booze” he says. “I want you to come here and give me the opportunity to embrace you and curate you.”

That’s not all Tuchman is embracing. He’s also taken to the whole non-fungible token or NFT craze. After some hesitation he’s joined with two NFT collections—Wall Street Bulls and Boss Beauties—to help raise money by selling NFTs in order to educate young traders about the financial markets. He believes NFTs that raise money for good causes will be the ones that survive long term and the ones that are “just penguins on an iPhone” will fade away. Tuchman’s NFT with the Wall Street Bulls is a caricature of him as a brown bull (crazy hair and all) riding on a rocket and holding an iPad—all set against a purple background with dollar bills floating in the sky around him.

With that Tuchman was off. A German television show wanted to interview him. And the new trading day was in full swing. “Put your big-boy pants on and take this seriously and it can be a successful thing” he imparts to me as he heads back onto the trading floor and I head to the exit and back onto Wall Street.

Oil fell and investors turned away from gold and other traditional havens they favor when fear is high.

The S&P 500 climbed 2.2% and notched its first weekly gain in three weeks. The benchmark index was following up on a wild Thursday when it careened from a 2.6% loss to a gain of 1.5%. Stocks have swung sharply with uncertainty about how much Russia's invasion will push up inflation particularly oil and natural gas prices and drag on the global economy.

The S&P 500 rose 95.95 points to 4384.65. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 834.92 points or 2.5% to 34058.75. The Nasdaq composite gained 221.04 points or 1.6% to 13694.62 after swinging between modest gains and losses. A day earlier it briefly fell more than 20% below its record high before roaring back suddenly.

Small-company stocks also notched gains. The Russell 2000 index rose 44.92 points or 2.3% to 2040.923.

Such big swings are likely to continue with so much uncertainty not only about Ukraine but also about interest rates. The Federal Reserve is caught in a delicate dance where it has to raise interest rates enough to rein in high inflation but not so much as to cause a recession.

On Friday at least the mood was calmer. Gold dropped 2% after rallying for weeks on worries about Russia and Ukraine. Treasury yields held relatively steady a sign that investors weren't scrambling for safety as they had immediately after Russia's invasion.

""The market acts emotionally when these things happen because it is so difficult to model"" said Mark Hackett chief of investment research at Nationwide.

A U.S. government report showed that that inflation last month was roughly in line with economists' expectations though it was still high. It also showed the main engine of the U.S. economy spending by consumers strengthened by more than economists expected.

The economic reports could be enough to persuade the Fed to hold off on raising short-term rates next month by double its usual increase at least for now said Brian Jacobsen senior investment strategist at Allspring Global Investments. That's something some Fed officials had suggested and it's something investors usually fear because higher rates put downward pressure on all kinds of investments. Whatever size it is the rate increase would be the first since 2018.

All the renewed calm in global financial markets though was against the backdrop of Russia pressing its invasion of Ukraine to the outskirts of the capital Friday after unleashing airstrikes on cities and military bases and sending in troops and tanks from three sides in what amounts to the largest ground conflict in Europe since World War II.

HISTORICAL OUTLOOK

Still investors may have been encouraged by looking at how past geopolitical crises including wars have affected the stock market. Generally stocks are initially put under pressure before conflict breaks out but then they tend to recover between three and six months later said Zachary Hill head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments.

But sanctions will ripple across the global economy. On Thursday President Joe Biden said the United States would cut off Russia's largest banks and largest companies from Western financial markets and restrict exports of technology to Russia. He also said the United States was freezing trillions of dollars in Russian assets including the funds controlled by Russian elites and their families.

European leaders agreed Friday to another round of sanctions aimed at the Russian economy and Putin himself. Western powers have left room to impose more severe economic penalties should the conflict escalate further.

The fighting in Ukraine has spurred volatility in the short term but the long-term economic effect for U.S. investors may be more muted said Kristina Hooper the chief global market strategist at Invesco.

""Many investors do look at this with a historical perspective and recognize while conflicts can be horrible in terms of human toll typically they don't have a real scarring impact"" on markets and the economy she said.

Prices for everything from stocks to Bitcoin have been swinging sharply with the uncertainty about Russia and Ukraine but the market's brightest spotlight has perhaps been on oil and natural gas. Russia is one of the world's largest producers of both oil and gas and European consumers are particularly reliant on it.

OIL PRICES DOWN

Oil prices fell on both sides of the Atlantic a day after they briefly topped $100 per barrel amid worries that the conflict and upcoming sanctions could disrupt supplies. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped 1.3% to $91.59 per barrel. Brent crude the international standard fell 1.2% to $97.93.

For all the financial whiplash associated with the conflict no nation has faced higher costs than Russia. The Moscow Exchange index's rout Thursday during the invasion wiped tens of billions off the value of Russian firms while the ruble plunged to a record low.

When announcing sanctions on Russia that he described as tough on Thursday Biden said that he will ""do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump.""

""We're not going to do anything which causes an unintended disruption to the flow of energy as the global economic recovery is still underway"" Deputy National Economic Council Director Daleep Singh said Thursday.

Ukraine was once home to thousands of nuclear weapons. The weapons were stationed there by the Soviet Union and inherited by Ukraine when at the end of the Cold War it became independent. It was the third-largest nuclear arsenal on Earth. During an optimistic moment in the early 1990s Ukraine’s leadership made what today seems like a fateful decision: to disarm the country and abandon those terrifying weapons in exchange for signed guarantees from the international community ensuring its future security.

The decision to disarm was portrayed at the time as a means of ensuring Ukraine’s security through agreements with the international community — which was exerting pressure over the issue — rather than through the more economically and politically costly path of maintaining its own nuclear program. Today with Ukraine being swarmed by heavily armed invading Russian troops bristling with weaponry and little prospect of defense from its erstwhile friends abroad that decision is looking like a bad one.

Nations that sacrifice their nuclear deterrents in exchange for promises of goodwill are often signing their own death warrants.

The tragedy now unfolding in Ukraine is underlining a broader principle clearly seen around the world: Nations that sacrifice their nuclear deterrents in exchange for promises of international goodwill are often signing their own death warrants. In a world bristling with weapons with the potential to end human civilization nonproliferation itself is a morally worthwhile and even necessary goal. But the experience of countries that actually have disarmed is likely to lead more of them to conclude otherwise in the future.

The betrayal of Ukrainians in particular cannot be understated. In 1994 the Ukrainian government signed a memorandum that brought its country into the global Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty while formally relinquishing its status as a nuclear state. The text of that agreement stated that in exchange for the step the “Russian Federation the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine.”

Ukraine’s territorial integrity has not been much respected since. After the 2014 annexation of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea by Russia — which brought no serious international response — Ukrainian leaders had already begun to think twice about the virtues of the agreement they had signed just two decades earlier. Today they sound positively bitter about it.

“We gave away the capability for nothing” Andriy Zahorodniuk a former defense minister of Ukraine said this month about his nation’s former nuclear weapons. “Now every time somebody offers us to sign a strip of paper the response is ‘Thank you very much. We already had one of those some time ago.’”

Ukrainians are not the only ones who have come to regret signing away their nuclear weapons. In 2003 Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi made a surprise announcement that his nation would abandon its nuclear program and chemical weapons in exchange for normalization with the West.

“Libya stands as one of the few countries to have voluntarily abandoned its WMD programs” wrote Judith Miller a few years later in an article about the decision headlined “Gadhafi’s Leap of Faith.” Miller then just out of the New York Times added that the White House had opted “to make Libya a true model for the region” by helping encourage other states with nuclear programs to follow Gaddafi’s example.

Libya kept moving forward. It signed on to an additional protocol of the International Atomic Energy Agency allowing for extensive international monitoring of nuclear reserves. In return sanctions against the country were lifted and relations between Washington and Tripoli severed during the Cold War were reestablished. Gaddafi and his family spent a few years building ties with Western elites and all seemed to be going well for the Libyan dictator.

Then came the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings. Gaddafi found that the same world leaders who had ostensibly become his economic partners and diplomatic allies were suddenly providing decisive military aid to his opposition — even cheering on his own death.

Promises betrayals aggression: It’s a pattern that extends even to countries that have merely considered foreclosing their avenues to a nuclear deterrent.

Take Iran: In 2015 the Islamic Republic signed a comprehensive nuclear deal with the U.S. that limited its possible breakout capacity toward building a nuclear weapon and provided extensive monitoring of its civilian nuclear program. Not long afterward the agreement was violated by the Trump administration despite the country’s own continued compliance. Since 2016 when Donald Trump left the deal Iran has been hit with crushing international sanctions that have devastated its economy and been subjected to a campaign of assassination targeting its senior military leadership.

To date no nuclear-armed state has ever faced a full-scale invasion by a foreign power regardless of its own actions.

The nuclear deal was characterized at the time as the first step toward a broader set of talks over regional disputes between Iranian and U.S. leaders who had been alienated since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Instead the deal marked another bitter chapter in the long-troubled relationship between the two countries.

To date no nuclear-armed state has ever faced a full-scale invasion by a foreign power regardless of its own actions. North Korea has managed to keep its hermetic political system intact for decades despite tensions with the international community. North Korean officials have even cited the example of Libya in discussing their own weapons. In 2011 as bombs rained down on Gaddafi’s government a North Korean foreign ministry official said “The Libyan crisis is teaching the international community a grave lesson.” That official went on to refer to giving up weapons in signed agreements as “an invasion tactic to disarm the country.”

Perhaps the starkest contrast to the treatment of Ukraine Libya and Iran however is Pakistan which developed nuclear weapons decades ago in defiance of the United States. Despite being criticized at the time for contributing to nuclear proliferation and facing periodic sanctions Pakistan has managed to insulate itself from attack or even serious ostracism by the U.S. despite several flagrant provocations in the decades since. Today Pakistan even remains a security partner of the U.S. having received billions of dollars of military aid over the past several decades.

Given the mortal hazards that nuclear weapons pose to life on Earth nonproliferation remains a worthwhile collective goal. Humanity will not benefit from a renewal of the nuclear arms race and the ideals behind a U.S.-backed rules-based liberal order are morally attractive. A world where they were truly applied would probably be a fairer and more peaceful one than what has existed in the past yet we must also recognize that the liberal order can and will fail. That lesson is especially true for small nations outmatched by great powers.

Given the tragedy we are witnessing in Ukraine today — where despite its past assurances the international community has remained a passive observer — leaders of small countries must be forgiven for thinking twice before sacrificing their deterrent regardless of what the leaders of great powers already armed with nuclear weaponry may say."

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can and often do change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available pricing information was not collected or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

IP,International Paper,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtdWsub3JnL3dtdWstbmV3cy8yMDIyLTAyLTI2L3ZlcmJ1cmctcGFyay10by1jbG9zZS1mb3ItcGNiLWNsZWFudXDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Verburg Park to close for PCB cleanup,"Signs were posted in the park last week letting visitors know that the remediation of the Kalamazoo River beginning at the end of March will last about three years and that Verburg Park will be closed until April 2023.

The responsible parties Georgia-Pacific and the International Paper Company will remove PCBs from the river between Gull Road and East Mosel Avenue but there’s a problem: the hundreds of thousands of cubic yards of sediment released from Morrow Lake in 2020.

As the remedial project manager of the Kalamazoo River site Jim Saric oversees the project for the Environmental Protection Agency.

“After the Morrow Dam released the sediment we have had an increase of sediment. It was deposited on top of these areas. Some areas it’s as thick as 2 to 4 feet some areas it’s not.”

What does that mean for the companies doing the cleanup?

“What it ultimately does is it results in more material having to be excavated from the river as part of our Superfund cleanup” said Saric.

Saric said turbidity curtains will float alongside and parallel to the bank to help contain the sediment churned-up by excavators pulling the muck out of the river and onto barges. Once it’s removed the contaminated sediment will be dried at a staging area in Verburg Park then trucked away for disposal at permitted landfills.

Before any of that can happen trees along the bank will have to be cut down.

“They have to remove some of the trees so that they can get access to the river and work along the banks from there” said Saric. “So they do that and then when the project is done we have a restoration plan that typically may include you know installing other trees.”

While the final restoration plan has not yet been approved Saric said the park should look better than before. He encouraged concerned citizens to look at completed PCB remediation projects at Portage Creek by the Plainwell Dam or near the Otsego Township Dam. He said vegetation will be replaced the water will be cleaner and fish in the area will start to recover.

“We’ve made it really clear it’s safe to recreate in the Kalamazoo River and always has been. Obviously we don’t want people swimming in the construction zone” Saric warned. “You really have to avoid the park during this time just for everyone’s safety because it’s a construction zone.”

To that end the public will not be able to use the current Kalamazoo River Valley Trail that runs alongside the park but Saric said Kalamazoo County is finalizing plans to reroute the KRVT so people can still use of the trail during the cleanup and have safe access around the construction site.

The boat launch at Verburg Park will also close. Saric said Georgia-Pacific is working with the city to permanently repair the boat launch at Mayors' Riverfront Park. That launch was damaged by the Morrow Dam sediment release and will be repaired before Verburg Park is closed to give boaters and emergency workers continuous access to the river.

West Fraser has applied for a new air permit for their McDavid Lumber Mill.

According to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection West Fraser proposes to build two new continuous lumber drying kilns at their facility located off Highway 29 between McDavid and Molino. They will be indirectly heated by the facility’s existing natural gas-fire boilers. The new kilns will replace three existing batch lumber drying kilns.

West Fraser “has provided reasonable assurance that operation of the two continuous drying kilns will not adversely impact air quality” according to FDEP. The agency has given notice that it intends to issue the air permit.

Based on the air permit application the project will result in emissions increases of: 11.25 tons per year of carbon monoxide; 6.24 tons per year of nitrogen oxides; 19.77 tons per year of particulate matter; 9.80 tons per year of particulate matter with a mean diameter of 10 microns or less; 4.14 tons per year of particulate matter with a mean diameter of 2.5 microns or less; 0.03 tons per year of sulfur dioxide; 337.29 tons per year of volatile organic compounds (VOC); and 7900 tons per year of greenhouse gases.

As defined by state regulations the project results in significant net emissions increases for VOC emissions per FDEP.

The state’s Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) Air Quality Modeling Best Practices was only triggered for the VOC emissions.

“The primary concern with respect to VOC emissions is the influence of such emissions on the formation of ozone in the region of the project site. An analysis conducted by the Department showed that the increase in VOC emissions resulting from the project will have no appreciable effect on ozone concentration in the region of the project site” FDEP stated.

According to FDEP West Fraser currently has the second highest emission level of volatile organic compounds in Escambia County and that amount will increase by 50.1% but remain about one-third of the VOC emissions from International Paper. (See FDEP table above click to enlarge.)

West Fraser intends to begin construction of the first kiln immediately upon issuance of the air construction permit and is expected to take approximately three to five months to complete. The construction of the second kiln and the elimination of the three existing kilns is expected to be completed by mid-2023.

The McDavid Lumber Mill processes southern yellow pine logs and has the capacity to produce up to 250 million board feet of lumber per year (MMBF/year). The facility contains three batch lumber drying kilns and a planer mill. The principal processes at the mill include: log storage and processing (debarking and sawing); sawmill operations (chipping and sawing); drying of green lumber using three indirect steam-heated batch kilns; and product lumber finishing sorting and shipping according to the state.",,,,,,,,,

They first hoped to bring employees back in January but were derailed by the Omicron variant. Now the firm is targeting March 7.

“We noticed other employers were saying ‘We’ll be back in April.’ ‘We’ll be back in June.’ But we said we need some certainty” said Sean Woodroffe the head of human resources at TIAA which has 12000 U.S. employees. “This March 7 date is only the second time we announced a date.”

And Mr. Woodroffe is facing this new return-to-office date with optimism he explained seated at his desk in front of a glimmering cityscape high above what he described as the bustling “vibe” of Midtown Manhattan. After all the firm has a 98 percent Covid-19 vaccination rate employees have been supplied with at-home tests and the line at the Third Avenue Wendy’s has been inching longer during lunchtime.

“With Omicron we realized that we needed to pivot from thinking about coming back into the office when Covid vanishes” he said. “We recognized we have to pivot to how do you responsibly cope with Covid?”",,,,,,,,,,,,

But this once-in-a-lifetime global crisis became the fuel that ignited a makeover of the Indian health sector. Dramatic changes happened in patient care patient management processes and allied services in the last 24 months.

There are over 500 trained robotic surgeons in India now. —Mandeep Singh Kumar vice president and general manager Intuitive India Our application ( qXR) helps to interpret X-rays faster and better. —Prashant Warrier Founder and CEO Qure.ai During the pandemic IISc professor Raghavan Varadarajan and his team in collaboration with startup Mynvax worked on developing an indigenous thermo-tolerant vaccine. We did 536 robotic surgeries during the pandemic which was much more than in any of the last 10 years. —Prof Dr Somashekhar S.P. chairman and HoD surgical oncology Manipal Comprehensive Cancer Centre

“One major structural change could be seen in intensive care units in hospitals”says Dr Swami Subramaniam a clinical pharmacologist and neuroscientist who has been in leadership roles in various health care companies. “Hospitals are investing big time in expanding not just intensive care unit capacity but also to train more intensivists. The normal beds to ICU beds ratio changed; hospitals added more ICU beds in this phase.”

Medical experts point out that during the first and second waves of the pandemic the system focused primarily on Covid-care. A vast majority of hospitals had stopped or postponed elective surgeries. But postponing emergency surgeries and procedures was not an option. The situation had forced many leading hospitals to turn to robot-assisted surgery to clear the backlog.

Robotic surgery allowed social distancing with fewer people around the patient and the robot. It also allows fast recovery of patients. “All of a sudden the number of open surgeries came down and robotic surgeries went up”says Prof Dr Somashekhar S.P. chairman and HoD surgical oncology Manipal Comprehensive Cancer Centre. Somashekhar one of the pioneers of robotic surgery in India has done over 2800 robotic surgeries in his career. “We did 536 robotic surgeries during the pandemic which was much more than in any of the last 10 years”he says.

Though robotic surgery was introduced many years earlier in India its usage has been limited. However fear of the virus infection from prolonged hospital stay—a requirement for most open surgeries—made patients demand robotic surgery. And this demand created a new crop of robotic surgeons in India who perform minimally invasive surgery using advanced surgical systems like Da Vinci.

Created by Intuitive a global technology leader in minimally invasive care Da Vinci is the most used surgical robotic system in the world. The country currently has more than 75 Da Vinci systems installed across major public and private hospitals. “There are over 500 trained robotic surgeons in India now” says Mandeep Singh Kumar vice president and general manager Intuitive India. Intuitive has three centres in India to train robotic surgeons. Last year the company started collaborating with top government medical colleges to familiarise future surgeons with robotic-assisted surgery. In January the company launched India’s first remote surgical case observation technology Intuitive Telepresence to enable those undergoing training to learn from expert robotic surgeons remotely.

It was not just global players like Intuitive desi health-techs also came up with innovative solutions—and even shortcuts—to deal with India’s systemic shortcomings. Take for instance the case of qXR of Qure.ai an AI-based chest X-ray analysing solution repurposed to screen the Covid-infected population in slums and remote villages. “Our application helps to interpret X-rays faster and better” says Prashant Warrier founder and CEO Qure.ai. Built with deep learning qXR can detect abnormalities in lungs bones diaphragm and heart with great precision in less than one minute.

During the first and second waves of Covid-19 RT-PCR or antigen testing facilities were not available in many parts of the country. Even if they were available two to three days were required to get the test result. “But X-ray centres are there in almost every corner” says Warrier. “The qXR on analysing X-rays would tell whether there is lung damage or lung infection because of Covid. Lung abnormalities were a major indicator of Covid infection.” Warrier however notes that X-rays were not always accurate in detecting Covid. “You might miss [Covid-positive] cases in which there is no lung damage visible”he says. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation adopted this technology for rapid screening of Covid-positive cases in Mumbai slums. The qXR utilises the scalability and agility offered by cloud computing technology to deliver its services.

It was during the pandemic that a large section of Indian hospitals moved their IT operations from legacy systems to the cloud. This led to wide-scale implementation of Software as a Service (SaaS)-based health care solutions across India. And the result was a heightened demand for techies in the health care sector.

“The sudden acceptance of the digital ecosystem to meet the patient demands during the pandemic has resulted in the need for health care providers to become digitally savvier”says Himesh Joshi who co-founded Ayu Health which had become a technology partner for over 60 private hospitals during the pandemic. According to data from employment website Monster.com job postings under the tag of Indian health care biotechnology and life sciences and the pharmaceuticals industry witnessed a 9 per cent year-on-year growth in January 2021. Software developers and artificial intelligence and machine learning professionals are in high demand capturing almost 40 per cent of the health care jobs listed. Job roles related to telemedicine digital marketing and clinical research also have seen a boom in the sector compared to pre-pandemic levels. “There have been several acquisitions and huge investments lately in the health-tech domain which has led to a rise in hiring demand in the sector”said Chandra Sekhar Garisa CEO Monster.com. “The sector is expected to grow at a 39 per cent compounded annual growth rate over FY2020-FY2023.”

Adarsh Natarajan CEO and founder of health startup AIndra Systems points out that technology can become a force multiplier to bring down the inequities in the Indian health care segment. AIndra’s flagship work is in pathology—one of the fastest advancing health care segments. Their AI platform Astra is built to detect critical illnesses such as cancer. Natarajan points out that the platform can be extended to build diagnostic tools for several critical illnesses. Both Qure.ai and AIndra are winners of the prestigious India-Sweden Healthcare Innovation Centre Challenge.

“The increased digitisation and AI in the health care sector will result in an uptick in tech-influenced jobs taking away from jobs having repetitive tasks”says Runam Mehta CEO HealthCube a point-of-care technology-enabled diagnostics services provider. “Candidates who have a good understanding of domain-specific business process management along with knowledge in AI and robotics will be highly coveted by any health care solutions company.”

Covid-19 has dramatically changed the way hospitals deliver outpatient care. In the initial phase several patients—including many who needed emergency care—avoided hospital visits because they did not want to leave their homes and risk exposure. This situation prompted health care providers to start telemedicine and home care services. Kalappa K.B. country head HR at Aster DM Healthcare says demand for telehealth services had seen a slow decline as Covid-19 lockdowns were lifted. “Because of the wider acceptance for home health care segment during the pandemic we increased the hiring of nurses and paramedics to suit the job roles in this segment”he says. “Another job that became hot during this phase was that of a mental health consultant. The work-from-home conditions and the varied clinical issues that arose because of Covid infection created a mental imbalance in many people. Hence the job of mental health consultants became more crucial.”

Ranjan B. Pandey the chief human resource officer at Fortis Healthcare says home care professionals were in high demand especially in the elderly care segment. The renewed focus on the ageing population and preventive care led to increased demand for skilled professionals like phlebotomists (technicians who collect blood from patients and prepare samples for testing) lab assistants and diagnosticians.

“Home collection of samples for lab testing also gained prominence”says Pandey. Medical recuperation professionals who offer post-Covid treatment and nutritionists are some of the other job profiles that gained prominence in the post-pandemic phase.

Covid has provided India with a unique opportunity to burnish its credentials as a global leader in vaccine manufacturing and drug development. Subramaniam who is currently serving as the CEO of Ignite Life Science Foundation—a Bengaluru-based non-profit scientific research institute says that the government is now considering policy directions to increase funding for research in domains like epidemic diseases. “So we expect that in the next few years we will see more centres dedicated to investigating pandemics and developing a response to pandemics”he says.

Raghavan Varadarajan

In July 2021 the Ignite Life Science Foundation announced its first grant award for “pandemic preparedness”research to a team led by Raghavan Varadarajan a professor at the Indian Institute of Science Bengaluru. The team will use the three-year grant to develop platform technologies for mRNA vaccine development.

Varadarajan works on stabilising and engineering proteins. “In the late 1990s the three-dimensional structure of one of the HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] proteins came out”he says. “And we thought it would be interesting to use what we knew to work on this sort of problem.”And that is how he got initiated into vaccine research.

During the pandemic Varadarajan’s team in collaboration with a Bengaluru-based startup Mynvax had worked on developing an indigenous thermo-tolerant vaccine—that can be stored at room temperature. They saw promising results in animal trials with their vaccine formulations. Their initial findings were published in the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology’s journal Journal of Biological Chemistry in 2020. However progress to clinical development has been delayed because of funding constraints.

Varadarajan says that as part of their Ignite-funded project his team will first create a normal mRNA vaccine. “As we get more experience we will try to make it thermotolerant”he says. All the currently available mRNA vaccines need to be stored at very cold temperatures.

“It has become clear that mRNA is an efficacious technology”says Varadarajan. “Before the pandemic mRNA was fairly untested. But there are still many things to be resolved in this segment. mRNA vaccines are not cheap and they have storage issues. Also a lot of intellectual property [rights] are held by a few companies. This is a major challenge in this field.”Varadarajan says that substantial and timely government funding to both academia and industry is required to catalyse research in this frontier area and to better prepare the country for future pandemics.

Prof Dr Somashekhar S.P.

The pandemic was a time when the country witnessed an explosive rise in biomedical waste—masks personal protective gears syringes vaccine vials. And lakhs of biomedical waste managers worked 24x7 to keep the country’s health infrastructure clean and safe. The service they offer to society often went unrecognised in the past. But the pandemic made people recognise the heroic work they do behind the scenes says Masood Mallick joint managing director of Ramky Enviro Engineers Limited a leading biomedical waste management firm. “The way our people stepped up it was like a soldier who waits his entire life for that one war”he says. “Most of the country’s Covid waste was treated by our frontline staff. We took waste from everywhere—not just from hospitals but also from commercial institutions converted into isolation centres and airports. We even handled waste from competitors who could not cope. We serve about 45000 hospitals in India. We have facilities for collection transport treatment and disposal of waste in 23 cities.”

Mallick says Ramky used its industrial waste managing facilities to augment and supplement its industrial waste management capacity. The company gave special monetary support to its biomedical waste handlers. It also started a comprehensive employee assistance programme to protect the families of frontliners in case of a Covid casualty. “Just 48 hours after the start of the national lockdown we had 100 per cent attendance. And that happened just because our people felt that it is their duty it is their time to serve"" says Mallick. “It is a matter of pride that our biomedical waste management team did not have a single fatality to date. After the pandemic began we started a campaign #OutThereForYou to tell our communities that we are out there for them. And there were some instances where our waste collection teams had received flower showers or were garlanded with money. Hard times bring the best out of people; the pandemic was a life-changing experience for our team.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Bitcoin solves inflation - without any real sound logic as to why or how...When you travel back in time the monetary systems have changed and evolved but are moving further and further away from the ""gold"" standard. Now as a crypto maxi you might see this as a good thing. However it also has it's drawdowns. The reason Gold and silver has been used for thousands of years is that it cannot be made and holds a rare earth material (Value) this is not as simple as saying ""a store of value"" and this I feel is where the confusion comes in.So let's explain how the governments use quantitative easing to cheat the public.In simple terms this is a policy in which the central bank's try to increase the liquidity in its financial system in order to inject money into the economy to expand economic activity. Or so we are told.If you look at this chart going back to 1965.You will see the QE levels of rapid supply of money - with nothing under pinning it. This is where the Gold standard is lost. However the story does not end there for Gold & Silver.Take a look at this;This is the Qualitative economic impact of the quantitative easing. This shows the asset price increases and then falls off a cliff. All whilst the Money (paper money) flattens out. So with the injection into the economy (wink wink) the demand increases the price increases and with a slight of hand - we have more borrowed dollars less tangible assets to support it.This isn't just a US problem nor a European issue - it's a global corrupt government issue. This is why the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.Take a look at countries such as Australia;These curves are parabolic.How's about Russia - could get even worse after this war;In summary it can help an economy out of recession but it can drive an economy to recessions also.So why or how does Gold and Silver fit in? Well as the value of money (cash) drops down spending power is robbed pensions depleted and costs sky rocket. The Dollars in circulation can buy less ""store of value assets"" - thus driving the price of said assets up. This is where many people get confused with the adoption of Bitcoin. They assume that with Bitcoin being decentralised (kinda) - you have to remember the rules and regulations imposed on money in and out of the system (KYC & AML) - on an immutable ledger; this is optimal for taxation identification and traceability by the way. The main issue is the store of value is only driven by what's in circulation how much demand and how accessible the supply. It is already stated that 91% of all of the BTC in existence is in the hands of the Elite. The value per coin is only the supply vs demand battle it's similarities to gold means it can be lost stolen or stored.But it's the underpinning method the governments use to increase the value of gold - that makes it likely to remain ""THE WAY"" for the foreseeable future. If I am honest I see Bitcoin or another crypto taking over the cash/payment system - more than I see it as a digital gold.Anyways - have a great weekend I thought this would be an interesting topic for discussion.This idea does not constitute as financial advice. It is for educational purposes only our principle trader has over 20 years’ experience in stocks ETF’s and Forex. Hence each trade setup might have different hold times entry or exit conditions and will vary from the post/idea shared here.

From a small Black resort hotel in Miami Cassius Clay took his first steps to a new boxing title and a new name.

The then 22-year-old Clay was staying at the Hampton House Motel in the segregated Brownsville community when he captured the heavy-weight championship title from Sonny Liston on Feb. 25 1964 at the Miami Beach Convention Hall.

Clay returned to the Hampton House to celebrate his success. Invited to the party were singer-songwriter Sam Cooke NFL star Jim Brown and Malcolm X the Nation of Islam leader credited with Clay’s religious conversion to Islam and his Muslim name Muhammad Ali.

Now 58 years later the renovated and renamed hotel is revisiting that heady time when Ali bragged and boxed his way onto the world stage.

The Historic Hampton House will host “The Greatest Weekend” Feb. 25-27 with films entertainment and guest speakers who will reminisce about the boxer his challenges and achievements.

“We are bringing back that great weekend reliving the fight and all the wonderful things that took place at the time” said Jacquetta B. Colyer board chair of the Historic Hampton House.

The 1964 victory party is the focus of Regina King’s 2020 film “One Night in Miami.” While the movie’s rendition of what was said among the Black celebrities may be imagined the actual victory party at the Hampton House was real Colyer said.

“Ali had a suite at the Hampton House and he came right back here to celebrate his victory” Colyer said. “They had planned to celebrate at the nearby Fontainebleau Hotel on Miami Beach but Ali could not receive accommodation there. He could win the heavy-weight championship of the world but not sleep at the Fontainebleau.”

The “Greatest Weekend” while offering reflections on the fight and Ali’s surprise win over Liston will highlight Ali’s Miami years and the role the Hampton House played in incubating Ali’s rise to heavy weight boxing champion.

The event is also one of the ways the Hampton House board is trying to revive the hotel’s presence and relevance in the community.

Opened in 1953 the Hampton House Motel catered to the Black middle class and attracted celebrities in entertainment sports business and civil rights at a time when segregation kept Blacks from staying at establishments for white guests.

The motel was one of 1100 “Green Book” hotels across the country that offered Black travelers accommodations during segregation. Victor Green’s book included several Florida safe havens. Now only seven hotels including the Hampton House have survived Colyer said.

For a moment it seemed the Hampton House was destined to close its doors as well.

Following the Civil Rights Movement Blacks began to stay at previously white-only establishments and the Hampton House and other “Green Book” hotels began to close. The motel fell into disrepair and was scheduled for demolition in the 1970s until retired social worker and educator Enid Pinkney devoted her life to restoring it.

“The young people need to know the history of our community and they don’t get it in school because the teachers don’t know it” said Pinkney who was determined to renovate the community eyesore.

Following years of fundraising and a two-year construction project the hotel’s main floor was brought back to life and reopened for special events in 2017. Additionally two boutique historic rooms the Martin Luther King Jr. room and the Cassius Clay room were fully redone.

What has already been restored cost $7 million funded in part by Miami-Dade County through the general obligation bond program and various fundraisers since 2001. The total restoration of the 30000 sq. ft. building will cost $15 million Colyer said.

But as board members brainstormed ways to restore more rooms and create a safe space for younger generations interested in learning about Black culture and history COVID-19 put the plans on hold.

“All of the human foot traffic came to a halt during 2020 but the bills kept coming” Colyer said.

Although the COVID-19 shut down wasn’t good for business or the board’s goals it did give board members time to reflect.

“It gave us a chance to really look at who we are and what we really wanted to do” Colyer said.

Now they hope to get The Historic Hampton House rebuilt up and running and fully functioning.

“We want the hotel to be what it was you know a hotel” Coyler said.

The plans meet Willie Oliver’s approval. He used to pass by the hotel without giving it a second notice.

“I would ride by and not think anything of it but now I walk by and some of the people that walked into this building makes me honored to be in this place” said Oliver 66. Both he and his wife recently volunteered at Pinkney’s 90th birthday celebration at the hotel.

Janiece Smith 44 was also a volunteer.

“I remember the first time I walked through the doors and felt the Hampton House” Smith said. “I could actually feel like heavy footsteps of the giants that walked these halls. People that made such an impact in the life that I lived today. It is an honor and a privilege to keep this legacy going.”

A Feb. 25 reception kicked off “The Greatest Weekend” events which are free and open to the public through Feb. 27. For the event schedule and to register visit Eventbrite.

Division 1: Davison dominates to secure semifinal berth

Davison looked every bit of a defending state champion as the Cardinals jumped out to a 42-0 lead over Warren Woods-Tower and cruised to a 74-6 win in Friday’s quarterfinal.

Bryan Shanks (152 pounds) Josh Barr (171) Remy Cotton (189) Jimmy Colley (215) and Zane Richardson (285) all picked up first period pins to spark the early lead with Barr’s fall taking just nine seconds.

Woods-Tower snapped the streak with a forfeit win from Daniel Stanisewski at 112 pounds but the Cardinals kept things rolling with two more pins from defending state champs Justin Gates (119) and Caden Horwath (125) who improved his season record to 24-0.

Returning state runner-up Evan Herriman added a quick pin in the match’s final bout with a 20 second fall against Woods-Tower’s Vincent Provo.

Woods-Tower wraps up its season at 7-9 while top-seeded Davison (17-4) advances to face No. 4 Macomb Dakota at 2:15 p.m. on Saturday.

Division 1: Strong finish puts Dakota in semis for first time since 2018

Temperance Bedford jumped out to a 13-3 lead over Macomb Dakota after four weight classes but the Cougars won the next 10 bouts to pull away with a 52-13 win and secure their first trip to the semifinals since 2018.

Bedford was without star 171-pounder Randy Boisselle who suffered an injury during last weekend’s individual regional tournament but teammates Rollie Denker and Ethan Manger picked him up with wins at 171 and 189 to put the Kicking Mules ahead by 10 points.

However Dakota controlled the rest of the match getting pins from Ozia Wilson (103) Caleb Weiand (119) Orion Wilson (125) and Jake Ferguson (140) to pile up the bonus points.

Ozia Wilson Dakota’s freshman phenom and Weiand a junior individual state title contender improved their season records to 43-0 and combined with the return of Orion Wilson earlier this month the Cougars boast one of the state’s strongest set of lightweights.

After withdrawing from last year’s quarterfinals due to COVID-19 protocols Dakota’s 2022 campaign continues at 2:15 p.m. Saturday for a semifinal showdown with Davison.

Division 1: Hartland cruises past Holt for first semifinal berth since 2017

Hartland jumped out to a 17-0 lead after three bouts and the Eagles never gave up ground the rest of the way finishing with a 45-18 win over sixth-seeded Holt and securing their first semifinal berth since 2017.

Nick Dimitroff got things rolling with a first-period pin over Carter Hodges at 152 pounds which Nick Rochowiak followed up with a technical fall before Brayden Bobo added six more bonus points with a late pin over Fletcher Smith.

Holt stopped the streak with a 3-0 win from Nathan Bremer of Chase Kern at 189 in a battle of state championship contenders but Hartland’s Avery Dickerson answered with a 31-second pin over Cole Newman to make it 23-3 with nine weight classes remaining.

Holt won a couple marquee matchups at 112 and 119 where Ryan Mosher defeated Patrick Wlodyga 7-1 and Mariano Lopez toppled Easton Culver 7-3 which made it 26-12 but it wasn’t enough to dig the Rams out of the hole.

Hartland advances to face Detroit Catholic Central 2:15 p.m. Saturday in a rematch of the Eagles’ last trip to the semis when they fell to the Shamrocks 54-10.

Division 1: DCC powers past Grandville

Detroit Catholic Central’s star-studded lineup featuring four defending state champions proved too much for Grandville to overcome at Friday’s state quarterfinals as the Shamrocks secured their seventh consecutive state semifinal appearance with a 67-6 win over the Bulldogs.

Drew Heethuis (119 pounds) Dylan Gilcher (145) and Manny Rojas (171) all showed off their individual state championship pedigree by pinning their Grandville opponents in the first period with Gilcher and Rojas using up fewer than 40 seconds. Gilcher improved his record to 33-0 while Rojas moved to 33-1.

DCC defeated Grandville 64-4 in the regular season and the quarterfinal matchup followed a similar script as the Shamrocks raced out to a 25-0 lead before heavyweight Jordan Kaat got an overtime win over Sean Field to make it 25-3.

DCC freshman Nathan Walkowiak responded with a second period pin over Justin Hoezee to make it 31-3 and though Grandville freshman Josh Vasquez pulled off an impressive 8-4 win over sophomore Simon Dominguez those would be the final three points for the Bulldogs who watched the Shamrocks close out the match with six consecutive pins.

Grandville wraps up its season at 15-4 while Detroit Catholic Central (13-3) advances to face Hartland at 9:30 a.m. Saturday in a semifinal that will feature 25 individual state qualifiers between the two teams.

Lowell High School’s Jackson Blum wrestles with Brother Rice High School’s Ricardo Saenz during the division 2 team wrestling quarterfinals at Wings Event Center in Kalamazoo Michigan on Friday Feb. 25 2022.Gabi Broekema | MLive.com

Division 2: Lowell continues quest for No. 9

Bloomfield Hills Brother Rice entered Wings Event Center coming off its first regional championship since 1988 and during that drought the Warriors’ quarterfinal opponent Lowell had captured 11 state titles.

The Red Arrows didn’t exactly provide a warm welcome for the team state newbies as Lowell ran away with a 68-9 win to continue its quest for a ninth consecutive state title.

Lowell jumped out to a 30-0 lead thanks to two forfeits and first-period pins from Will Neeley (171 pounds) Carson Crace (189) and Braddock King (103) before Jace Morgan got Brother Rice on the board with a pin over Christopher Rogers at 112 pounds.

The Red Arrows answered with back-to-back pins of their own including a third-period fall from Jackson Blum who handed Ricardo Saenz his first loss of the season.

Brother Rice wraps up its season at 19-6 and with a starting lineup that features five freshmen including Saenz it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the Warriors back in the quarterfinals before long.

Meanwhile Lowell (21-3) advances to Saturday’s state semifinals where it will face Gaylord at noon in a rematch of the 2018 and 2020 state championship matches.

Division 2: Gaylord edges Jefferson to reach 6th semifinal in 8 years

Monroe Jefferson got a boost with the return of star lightweight Cody Richards who missed the individual district tournament but it wasn’t quite enough for the Bears to get past Gaylord as the Blue Devils escaped with a 36-35 win.

Richards gave his team bonus points when Gaylord voided at his 112-pound weight class which gave Jefferson an 18-12 advantage and the Bears increased their lead with pin from Ryder Mulherin and a technical fall from John Allen.

Gaylord’s Louden Stradling a two-time individual state runner-up stopped his team’s skid with a first period pin at 130 which sparked a string of five consecutive wins for the Blue Devils including the match-sealing pin from Benny Blyveis at 152.

Also of note was Gaylord 171-pounder Kaeden Yocum picking up career win No. 100 with a decision in the match’s first bout.

Jefferson wraps up its season at 18-4 while Gaylord (28-0) will face Lowell in Saturday’s noon semifinals.

Division 2: Goodrich pulls away from Mason for second consecutive semifinal berth

The middleweights made all the different for Goodrich in its quarterfinal matchup with Mason as the Martians won six in a row from 125 to 152 pounds in their 54-19 win over the Bulldogs.

After Mason’s Tayden Miller improved his season record to 33-0 with a first-period pin over Brody Orcutt at 119 Goodrich reeled off five pins and a decision to turn a close match into a runaway win.

Ryan Angelo (125) and Luke Francis (130) both pulled out third-period pins while teammates Carsen Richards (145) and Keegan Switzenburg (152) logged first-period falls to pad the lead.

Mason wraps up its season at 32-4 while Goodrich (30-2) continues its quest for a return to the state championship match where the Martians fell to Lowell last year. Next up is Saturday’s noon semifinal against Whitehall.

Division 2: Whitehall tops St. Joseph in thriller

The most thrilling match of the day came down to the final bout as Whitehall freshman Wyatt Jenkins pinned St. Joseph’s Yazah Farhan in the first period of their 160-pound bout to seal the Vikings 39-28 victory over the upset-minded Bears.

St. Joseph’s Jacob Halsey gave St. Joseph a big boost with a third-period pin at 171 pounds to open the match but second-seeded Whitehall responded with the next three weight classes including pins from heavyweight Shane Cook and senior Ira Jenkins (215) a defending state champ who improved his season record to 46-0.

An overtime win from St. Joseph freshman Marcus Lowry at 103 gave the Bears some key points but Whitehall answered with an overtime win of its own at 112 where Dylan Osborne defeated Noah Dahlke.

Nolan Wertanen’s pin at 119 improved the two-time state champ’s season record to 47-0 and started a 19-point streak that gave St. Joseph a 28-18 lead with four weight classes left but Whitehall went on its on streak and got bonus points from a forfeit win at 145 and a Alec Pruett pin at 152 before the younger Jenkins sealed the deal.

St. Joseph’s season comes to an end with a 23-9 record and the Bears first trip to the state quarterfinals while Whitehall (27-0) also made some history by advancing to its first Division 2 semifinals after reaching that point six times in Division 3. The Vikings will meet Goodrich in the semifinals at noon on Saturday.

Magna Park Lutterworth is the UK and Europe’s largest dedicated logistics and distribution park situated within the Midlands’ ‘Golden Triangle’ of logistics. Home to 36 different customers and occupying over 11 million SQ FT of sustainable floor space across 41 buildings Magna Park Lutterworth is GLP’s flagship distribution park.

The deals in the park include two spec build lettings and a build to suit transaction in the North plus a letting of an existing building in Magna Park Central:

Bleckmann a fashion and lifestyle supply chain expert has leased the first of the three “spec builds” in Magna Park North taking a 200102 SQ FT building (MPN1) on a long-term lease. The warehouse will be used to service Bleckmann’s increasing number of contracts and will be the company’s second unit leased at Magna Park Lutterworth after it acquired Tornado-186 18 months ago.

Iron Mountain an information management services company has signed an agreement to lease MPN3 the third spec building under construction totaling 297194 SQ FT. This will support Iron Mountain’s UK expansion strategy. MPN3 is expected to complete by the end of March 2022.

LX Pantos has taken a building on a built to suit basis – MPN4 totaling 310000 SQ FT which is expected to complete by July 2022. LX Pantos is upsizing from an existing facility and plans to use the warehouse to service LG Electronics amongst other top brands.

In a separate development GLP has completed the letting of Hurricane-258 a 258000 SQ FT cross-docked distribution unit located within the Magna Park Central Lutterworth development to Rhenus Home Delivery. Rhenus intends to operate the unit as a two-man lift operation in response to the further growth of their home delivery business.

The letting brings the park close to 100% occupancy with only MPN2 GLP’s 500000 SQ FT spec build available. MPN2 is currently under construction and is expected to complete in March 2022.

Following the highly successful development of 1.2 million SQ FT (Phase one) last year in Magna Park South (MPS) GLP has announced it has commenced the next phase (Phase two) of speculative development in MPS with another 1 million SQ FT being constructed across four buildings.

The development will see the construction of 186000 211000 256000 and 355000 SQ FT buildings respectively. Work on-site will commence in Q2 and is expected to complete by Q4 2022.

As with all GLP’s developments the existing and new units follow GLP’s rigorous ESG development standards and benefit from best-in-class specification including wide service yards significant HGV and car parking allocations dock levelers level access doors increased natural light electric vehicle charging and abundant power supply. Each development is also BREEAM Excellent designed to WELL principles and features a range of sustainability and energy efficiency measures.

Joe Garwood Senior Development Director at GLP explains: “This marks an exciting time in the ongoing development of Magna Park Lutterworth which has been firmly established as Europe’s leading logistics and distribution park. The park has seen unprecedented development and leasing activity in recent months with GLP completing eight deals over the course of last year totaling 2.2 million SQ FT. We are delighted to partner with such well-established companies and we look forward to working with Bleckmann Iron Mountain LX Pantos and Rhenus Home Delivery and supporting them as they grow.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMubWxpdmUuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvYW5uYXJib3IvbmFtZS9rYXRocnluLXZhbi1nYXNzZS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMzQ3MDgyNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kathryn Van Gasse Obituary (1926 - 2022) - Norway MI - Ann Arbor News,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://obits.mlive.com/us/obituaries/annarbor/name/kathryn-van-gasse-obituary?id=33470824 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vb2JpdHMubWxpdmUuY29tL3VzL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvYW5uYXJib3IvbmFtZS9rYXRocnluLXZhbi1nYXNzZS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zMzQ3MDgyNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Tied together the three initiatives highlight a progressive approach to the future of moving goods and equipment across the world that could create jobs and investments in Arkansas.

First Tuesday morning electric vehicle manufacturer Envirotech Vehicles Inc. announced it would move its corporate headquarters and manufacturing operations to Osceola and create 800 new jobs in the Mississippi County community. Envirotech said it wanted to be near a major supplier U.S. Steel and take advantage of other abundant resources chiefly the Mississippi River. The company's $80.7 million investment could grow by another $200 million as electric vehicle production picks up over the next few years.

Let that sink in for a minute -- a California company based in the greater Los Angeles area is packing up and moving to an Arkansas town with less than 10000 residents.

Later Tuesday morning Gov. Asa Hutchinson launched what he said would be a full-fledged effort to support future mobility initiatives in the state -- he wants to create a business environment and workforce that promotes emerging technologies and encourages efforts to deliver and move goods and people across the country and the world.

The Arkansas Council on Future Mobility the governor said will ""lay the foundation for Arkansas leadership in the transportation industry for decades to come.""

That includes promoting electric vehicles drones driverless vehicles and air-mobility vehicles that can take off and land vertically. He announced 17 appointees to the council -- including key executives from global leaders like Walmart Tyson Foods Google and J.B Hunt Transportation Services Inc. among others.

The governor appointed Cyrus Sigari of Up Partners a California venture capital firm to chair the council. Hutchinson said Sigari is considered one of the world's leading experts on future mobility and is an expert in advanced air mobility.

Sigari is also key to the week's third announcement that was issued Wednesday by the Runway Group of Bentonville which is led by Steuart and Tom Walton grandsons of Walmart founder Sam Walton. Runway has built a team of supporters and financial backers to promote air mobility initiatives that can move goods and equipment through the air.

Now digest for a second the supply-chain issues being experienced worldwide with snarled shipping traffic that has slowed delivery of essential products and equipment to businesses everywhere.

Going airborne with vehicles -- smaller and more environmentally sustainable than the jets used today by global carriers like UPS FedEx and Amazon -- could avoid supply chain knots tying up deliveries today. Airborne vehicles would be more efficient and effective in short trips as well.

Arkansas has a long and successful history of building and supporting transportation efforts through the trucking industry. One key to the futuristic approach is including those carriers in the mobility efforts -- and that has been done both with the governor's council and the air-mobility initiative that has drawn a multi-million-dollar investment from the Walton team. Sigari's capital venture firm Up Partners is a member of the Runway initiative.

The Runway announcement noted air mobility could deliver $3.6 billion in new economic activity and related stimulus to Arkansas over the next 20 years.

Arkansas could be the hub of mobility companies in the future the announcement said calling for a combined effort to ""strive to create the Jetsons-like paradise"" with flying cars and delivery vehicles along with drones that drop packages at our doorsteps.

Sigari in comments Tuesday as he was announced to lead the governor's mobility council said Arkansas can foster growth and development of mobility companies just as Silicon Valley nurtured the technology giants of today.

""Some of the most transformative internet companies were built in Silicon Valley"" he said Tuesday. ""We believe some of the most transformative mobility companies will be built here in Arkansas.""

SOLAR BANKING

Peoples Bank of Sheridan has installed a 56-kilowatt solar array that will make it one of the first community banks in Arkansas to be completely powered by solar energy.

The bank's solar array is expected to save more than $243000 in energy costs over the next 30 years. The system installed by Delta Solar of Little Rock is designed to produce enough power to offset energy usage at the bank's Sheridan headquarters.

""Delta Solar's team provided us a personalized solar solution that made sense environmentally and economically"" said Craig Manatt president and chief executive officer of Peoples Bank. ""Our solar system is a win-win for the bank as we were able to significantly reduce our electricity costs while generating a strong return on our investment.""

Delta Solar is Arkansas owned and operated. ""We are excited to have collaborated with Peoples Bank to design and build a system that meets 100% of their energy needs and provides significant cost savings to help better serve their customers and community"" said Bob East chairman of Delta Solar.

RECORD YEAR AT ARVEST EQUIPMENT

Arvest Equipment Finance had a record year in 2021 with more than $418.6 million in gross production a year-over-year increase of more than 49%. The division of Arvest Bank also saw its total portfolio jump more than 33% year-over-year from $513.7 million in 2020 to $685 million last year.

""We are proud of the growth we saw last year and more importantly pleased we were able to help so many customers"" Arkansas Equipment Finance president Eric Bunnell said.

Growth is allowing the division to add a medical equipment program to its portfolio.

Arvest Equipment Finance is based in Fort Smith and has offices in Little Rock Kansas City and Tulsa. It does business in Arvest Bank's four-state operating area: Arkansas Kansas Missouri and Oklahoma.

This company which is in the Zacks Electronics - Miscellaneous Services industry shows potential for another earnings beat.

This payment processsing company has an established record of topping earnings estimates especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 7.38%.

For the last reported quarter Jack Henry came out with earnings of $1.22 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14 per share representing a surprise of 7.02%. For the previous quarter the company was expected to post earnings of $1.29 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.39 per share delivering a surprise of 7.75%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For Jack Henry estimates have been trending higher thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words if you have 10 stocks with this combination the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Jack Henry has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% at the moment suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 7 2024.

With the Earnings ESP metric it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

One family in particular helped drive the team’s achievements from Newtown High School: the Jacobs family.

There was no Newtown-specific ski team at NHS so this combined school team has given athletes Tyler Fralley Andrew Jacobs Lauren Jacobs Matt Jacobs Kyle Ruddy Joseph Silverman and Yarema Stasyshyn the opportunity to ski competitively at the high school level.

At the State Championship at Mount Southington on February 10 the ski team took home a fifth-place finish. Senior Captain Matt Jacobs was the overall individual state champion and Andrew Jacobs placed 20th.

“It was great to finally get the state championship after falling last year” Matt said.

On the girls’ side junior captain Lauren was the second overall individual in the state.

Based on how they competed all season the boys’ team was South-West Conference runner-up. Matt was the SWC champion and Andrew Jacobs placed fourth. Additionally Fralley contributed to the team score. Lauren was crowned SWC champion as well resulting in a first-place Jacobs sweep.

All of the races for the season took place at Mount Southington. Throughout the entire season Matt and Lauren placed either first or second in each of their races and Andrew placed in the top ten.

“It’s been really awesome to be able to perform as well as we have this season especially because I’ve been able to share that experience with my brothers. We’ve all been in this sport for a long time so it’s really rewarding to see it pay off” Lauren said.

Senior twins Matt and Andrew along with Lauren who is one year younger have thrived throughout their time competing at the high school level.

“Being able to race with my family the last four years has been such a fun experience. I think it helped add to all of our success” Andrew said.

Next up for the Jacobs family trio is the High School Alpine Skiing Eastern Regional Championships to be held in New Hampshire in early March. Because of their performance in a qualifying competition they will represent team Connecticut at the championship. Twelve boys and a dozen girls were selected to represent the state.

“I’m really happy with how the whole season went and can’t wait for Easterns” Matt said.

Tyler Fralley left and siblings Lauren Andrew and Matt Jacobs helped the Newtown-Pomperaug ski team to success in the state championships at Mount Southington.

And she like hopped on the next flight and was here and I’m like ‘Oh you’re a bad bitch. I love you.’ But since she had just started dating Thomas she [was] telling me all about him.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson continues to oversee one of the narrowest House majorities in history leaving little margin for error as he navigates his conference and faces threats to his leadership.

Republicans control 217 seats while Democrats control 213 after Democratic Rep. Tim Kennedy of New York was sworn in Monday evening. There are currently five vacant seats.

That breakdown leaves Republicans with a one-vote margin which means they can only afford one defection from within their conference to still pass legislation on a party-line when all members are present and voting. A tie vote in the House is a fail.

In addition to the tight margin there is always the possibility that absences can further impact the vote math.

The tight vote margin means that any individual member has the potential to exert outsized influence and Johnson has frequently felt pressure from his right flank.

The extremely narrow margin has forced the speaker to put high-profile bills directly onto the floor under a procedural move known as suspension of the rules in certain instances as his right flank has increasingly taken to tanking rule votes on the floor in a show of protest.

But that strategy compels the need for a two-thirds majority to pass bills requiring significant Democratic support and further alienating Johnson from the right wing of his conference.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDUvdXMvcG9saXRpY3MvcHJpc29uLW1lbnRhbC1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,For Markus Johnson Prison and Mental Illness Equaled a Death Sentence,"Markus Johnson slumped naked against the wall of his cell skin flecked with pepper spray his face a mask of puzzlement exhaustion and resignation.

Most dangerous of all he had stealthily stopped drinking water hastening the physical collapse that often accompanies full-scale mental crises.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNhZ290cmlidW5lLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA2L2pvaG5zb24tcHVsbHMtcGxhbnMtbWlncmFudC1zaGVsdGVyLTExdGgtd2FyZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Johnson reverses course on moving migrants from downtown to proposed shelter in 11th Ward after stiff opposition ...,"Mayor Brandon Johnson announced Monday he is pulling his proposal to move migrants from downtown to a new shelter in the South Side 11th Ward before the Democratic National Convention in the face of stiff opposition from the local alderman and the building’s owners the latest setback in the administration’s attempts to house asylum-seekers.

The change came after the owners of the property said Johnson never informed them of his plans to use the building at 3951 S. Canal St. for a shelter. When the Tribune asked the city about that apparent disconnect the Department of Family and Support Services released a Monday statement saying the city is “no longer considering” doing so.

“We were surprised to hear news reports of the City’s plan to possibly use our property as a migrant shelter” Bajaj Medical the pharmaceutical company that owns the building in the New City neighborhood said in a Sunday statement. “Bajaj Medical has not been contacted by City officials and has not approved and does not intend to approve any public use of this property.”

DFSS’ statement acknowledged that was true but clarified that “while City staff had not had conversations with the owner there were conversations held with the owner’s broker of the property and our vendor.”

Representatives with Bajaj Medical which lists Ram Chakroborty as its registered agent in state business records did not respond to a request for further comment on Monday.

Ald. Nicole Lee 11th told the Tribune earlier on Sunday that the “pretty shocking” communication breakdown points to a larger pattern of the Johnson administration’s shaky leadership on the migrant crisis.

“What’s going on? What’s going on that nobody was in touch with the owners?” Lee said. “This shines a big light and calls into question how this is being managed and the people that we have working for the city … That just is mind-blowing to me.”

Reached for comment Monday after the plan was killed Lee said she was “pleased and grateful.” But her blistering critiques from the previous day reflected new levels of frustration from the alderman who represents Chinatown and Bridgeport after being appointed by Mayor Lori Lightfoot and then winning a full term.

Lee had said the proposal to house migrants in an industrial area surrounded by train tracks elicited environmental and safety concerns. But what most disappointed her was the administration’s explanation that the move was because of the planned closure of a downtown migrant shelter before the Democratic National Convention comes to Chicago in August she said.

“I was told that the location would need renovations that they needed to get everything done and ready for a July 1 move-in ahead of the DNC” Lee said Sunday. “It was pretty disturbing. … It seemed that they were down a path and I’m hoping that we’ve as a city learned a lot of lessons from all of the experiences in the last year with opening shelters.”

The fate of the 41000-plus asylum-seekers who have arrived in Chicago since 2022 has been an ongoing quandary for Johnson who has struggled with how to move expeditiously to house them in shelters without angering the city’s 50 aldermen a role that comes with being territorial over ward matters. Attempts to place asylum-seekers in sites from the Far Northwest Side to Roseland have run into a seemingly never-ending cascade of grumbles from council members across the political spectrum.

One of the most high-profile conflicts concerned Ald. Julia Ramirez 12th a freshman progressive who ultimately prevailed in seeing a proposed winterized base camp for 2000 migrants scrapped after Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s administration yanked funding away due to environmental concerns. Other aldermen have been less successful.

Lee is more of a political moderate within the City Council and endorsed Johnson’s runoff opponent Paul Vallas after her chosen candidate Lightfoot was knocked out of the running. However she has voted with Johnson to give him some slim City Council wins: She backed the Gaza cease-fire resolution that prevailed in a tie-breaker vote cast by the mayor and Johnson’s recent move to allocate another $70 million in city funds to address the migrant crisis.

On Sunday the alderman signaled those days may be over: “The city has been spending an inordinate amount of money in response to this. … I see what we’re getting in return. We’re paying Ritz-Carlton rates for Motel Six service.”

Johnson’s team has been vexed by the aldermanic pushback with his chief of staff Cristina Pacione-Zayas often stressing in reporter briefings that the city is in crisis mode and council members need to step up and meet the administration halfway.

The DFSS statement on the shelved 11th Ward proposal on Monday said “As part of our commitment to foster transparency and inclusivity Ald. Lee was given notice early in the process in an effort to gather feedback and information about this potential site. This site was under preliminary consideration and a site visit by various City departments had not been conducted.”

Bajaj Medical has contributed $1001 to Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart and $2800 to the 11th Ward Democrats according to state campaign finance records.

Complicating the matter further still is the mayor’s task to showcase Chicago’s strengths — including its reputation as a pro-immigrant city — on a national stage at the DNC. Johnson has long pointed to the way his own election energized young progressives and reflected the party’s leftward shift as proof Chicago is the perfect place to celebrate President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign.

Republicans though have highlighted past scenes of migrant families sleeping outside Chicago police stations to make the case Biden is weak on immigration and the nation’s eyes will be on the United Center as well as the downtown business district during the affair. The latter area is home to the Standard Club shelter 320 S. Plymouth Court where over 900 migrants live. Johnson wanted to move the Standard Club residents to the Canal Street building according to Lee.

So far a sudden escalation of migrant buses sent north from Texas has not repeated itself but few within Chicago government are counting on that reprieve to last as the Democratic Party event draws near.

Johnson meanwhile dodged questions Monday on the botched 11th Ward shelter plans by blaming Texas Gov. Greg Abbott for sending migrant buses to Chicago.

“We have to be prepared for things that we don’t have control of one of which is the behavior of the governor of Texas” the mayor told reporters before making a reference to the recent rap beef between artists Kendrick Lamar and Drake. “Now I’m not quite sure if he’s auditioning to come up with a diss track for the state of Illinois or the city of Chicago but the fact of the matter is his behavior has caused chaos around this country.”

The ATM network is available in the US and has over 16000 units throughout the country.

As noted in an update from C6 Bank this is one of the first benefits announced to C6 Bank customers after the “formalization” of the partnership with JPMorgan Chase which acquired a 40% stake in the Brazilian banking platform. JP operates in the American retail segment “under the Chase brand whose digital platform for banking products serves more than 55 million customers.”

Chase ATMs are reportedly part of the Cirrus network of self-service terminals with over 2 million units across the globe. C6 Bank Global Account clients may use any ATM in the Cirrus network “with a limit of four daily withdrawals for a maximum amount of USD 500 or €500 at a time at a cost of USD 5 per withdrawal plus the fee charged by the local ATM.”

At Chase ATMs these charges “no longer exist saving you $8.50 per withdrawal.” And for the first few months while the service is being implemented the C6 Bank fee “will be debited from the customer’s account with each withdrawal and refunded the next day.”

In order to have a Dollar or Euro Global Account you must be “an individual C6 Bank account holder and request the opening of the international account in the bank’s application.” Afterwards the customer simply “transfers reals from his current account to his Global Account where the amount is automatically converted.”

As explained in the update the transfer takes place immediately and “can be carried out 24 hours a day.”

In order to convert the Brazilian currency to foreign versions the reference used by the bank is the commercial currency whose quotation “is lower than the paper sold for tourism.”

Transactions are “based on the IOF (Tax on Financial Operations) of 1.1% and a spread of 2%” the announcement noted.

In order to get an idea of ​​the advantage in a purchase with a credit card abroad the IOF transaction “is levied at 6.38% and an exchange spread of 4%.”

At the beginning of the year the C6 Bank Global Account also “started to offer the transfer feature to other countries allowing the account holder in a few steps to send and receive dollars from any bank account abroad.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vaGVhdnkuY29tL25ld3MvaG91c3Rvbi9tYWxpa2EtbWl0Y2hlbGwtc3Rld2FydC1jaGFzZS1iYW5rLXJhY2lzbS1sYXdzdWl0L9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vaGVhdnkuY29tL25ld3MvaG91c3Rvbi9tYWxpa2EtbWl0Y2hlbGwtc3Rld2FydC1jaGFzZS1iYW5rLXJhY2lzbS1sYXdzdWl0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Malika Mitchell-Stewart: Houston Doctor Sues Chase Bank,"Malika Mitchell-Stewart is a Black Houston doctor who filed a federal lawsuit against Chase Bank accusing employees of racism.

Mitchell-Stewart is seeking $1 million in compensatory and punitive damages in the lawsuit which accuses JP Morgan Chase Trupti Patel and Shae Wells of violating the Civil Rights Act which “forbids racial discrimination.” The incident occurred on December 18 2021 at Chase Bank’s First Colony Branch.

The lawsuit says “Dr. Mitchell-Stewart just completed her residency and started employment with the Valley Oaks Medical Group. As she embarks on her career as a physician and throughout her career it is a professional requirement that Dr. Mitchell-Stewart’s criminal record be spotless. She knows that to be accused of a crime would not only be damaging but it could derail a career that she is just now starting. Until recently Dr. Mitchell-Stewart certainly did not expect that when she attempted to open a bank account with Chase and proudly deposit her first check as a new physician she would be accused of fraud and denied the ability to open a bank account at one of the more prominent retail banks in the world.

Moore and Stafford added in the lawsuit “What Dr. Mitchell-Stewart was reminded of on this day was that she is a Black woman attempting to deposit $16000 in a predominantly white affluent suburb. … Solely because of her race Dr. Mitchell-Stewart was discriminated against by members of Chase’s banking staff and denied services provided to non-African American customers of Chase.”

Chase Bank said in a statement “We take this matter very seriously and are investigating the situation. We have reached out to Dr. Mitchell-Stewart to better understand what happened and apologize for her experience.”

Dr. Mitchell-Stewart Says in the Lawsuit ‘She Was Humiliated & Treated Like a Criminal’ by Chase Bank Employees Who Accused Her of Having a Fraudulent Check

Mitchell-Stewart who lives in Missouri City and graduated from the McGovern Medical School at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston Texas said in the lawsuit she went to the Sugar Land Chase Bank branch on December 18 2021 to open an account and deposit a signing bonus check from Valley Oaks Medical Group for $16780.16. Mitchell-Stewart had recently opened a medical office on Braxton Drive in Houston according to her Instagram.

She said in the lawsuit that because she was not a JPMorgan Chase account holder she planned to open an account at the branch to deposit the bonus check and future checks. She was first assisted at the bank by an employee named Trupti Patel according to the lawsuit. “After reviewing the amount of the check Dr. Mitchell-Stewart wanted to deposit Patel began to ask peculiar questions about Dr. Mitchell-Stewart that challenged the validity of the check and her employment as a physician” the lawsuit says. “After Patel’s odd inquiry into Dr. Mitchell-Stewart she claimed that she needed to verify the check and get a bank manager.”

According to the lawsuit Patel returned with another employee Shae Wells who presented herself as the “branch manager.” The lawsuit claims Wells is actually an associate banker and lead teller-operations specialist at the First Colony branch. “Wells told Dr. Mitchell-Stewart that her check was fraudulent with providing justification” the lawsuit states.

According to the lawsuit “Wells then told Dr. Mitchell-Stewart that she did not feel comfortable allowing her to open a bank account at the First Colony branch with the check because Wells believed Dr. Mitchell-Stewart was attempting to commit fraud. Wells refused to provide any alternative methods or means to assist. Dr. Mitchell-Stewart.

The lawsuit adds “After being denied services at the First Colony branch Dr. Mitchell-Stewart went home to avoid being arrested and had an adverse emotional reaction over this humiliation. After years of training to become a physician she was humiliated and treated like a criminal after getting her first check after years of being in medical residency. As soon as Dr. Mitchell-Stewart showed employees at First Colony branch her check they immediately treated her like a criminal. Even after Dr. Mitchell-Stewart showed employees at First Colony branch identification emails between her and the clinic she works with along with her business card she was still treated like a criminal.”

Mitchell-Stewart’s Attorney Said ‘I Will Endeavor to Show That No Bank Can Refuse Service to Our People Because of Race’

According to the lawsuit Mitchell-Stewart who completed her residency at the Dell Seton Medical Center and Dell Children’s Medical Center at the University of Texas in Austin was “forced to go days during the Christmas holiday season without her first check as a physician. This caused her great anxiety. Dr. Mitchell-Stewart accompanied by her mother returned to file a complaint at the First Colony branch along with her mother on December 27 2021.”

The lawsuit says branch manager Janice Brooks “admitted” Mitchell-Stewart that she could have opened an account at the branch on December 18 2021 and deposited the check and the bank would have only had to hold the funds until the transaction was verified. “When Dr. Mitchell-Stewart expressed displeasure over why this was not done branch manager Janice M. Brooks apologized but then stated Chase can refuse service to people without justification.”

Justin Moore Mitchell-Stewart’s attorney wrote on Facebook “For many black Americans going to the bank can be a fraught experience. Something as simple as trying to cash a check or open a bank account can lead to suspicious employees summoning the police causing anxiety and fear — and sometimes even physical danger — for the accused customers.” He added:

This isn’t a new occurrence for @chase. In 2020 a JPMorgan Chase employee had described a customer as being “from Section 8” and therefore undeserving of service. The bank has since said it would seek to increase its sensitivity to issues surrounding race. They’ve failed… The bank branch in Houston that discriminated against my client claimed that the amount of the check and who the person was trying to deposit it- my client- made them feel uncomfortable. My client left distraught that she was made to feel like a criminal and because she was unable to use her hard earned funds for Christmas shopping late that Saturday. Even with facing such humiliation she returned after Christmas to file a complaint. Upon filing the complaint the actual branch manager met with her. And even though she apologized my client was told that the bank can refuse service for any reason.

Moore added “Well legally that’s not true. And I will endeavor to show that no bank can refuse service to our people because of their race. #bankingwhileblack #blackeconomics.”

He wrote on Facebook “Her practice is community focused and she is intentional on serving her people. This to me made what happened to her even more egregious. For her credentials to be questioned and for her to be accused of being a scammer is unforgivable. Only 3% of physicians are black women and we as a community need to protect them when instances of blatant discrimination is used to belittle and diminish their status as essential professionals.”

Mitchell-Stewart added on Instagram “I look forward to working with him to seek Justice for myself and so many others! I appreciate the outpouring of support and kind words. I also appreciate those willing to share similar stories with me about their negative interactions with Chase. Things must change and just because it may not have happened to you it could one day so it is best for us all to work together and implement new policies and changes so that those involved are held accountable and this will not continue to happen!!!”

Vitali and Wladimir the boxing champions fighting for Ukraine's future,"The Klitschko brothers were brought up by their mother Nadezhda and their father Vladimir a proud Soviet man who rose to become a high-ranking military officer. It was a job which afforded his two sons Vitali and Wladimir their high-quality education and instilled a disciplined streak which sowed the seeds of a boxing dynasty. It is a strange twist of fate then that the brothers should now be drawn into a bloody war against Russia the nation their father dedicated his life to.

Vladimir eventually gave his life for Russia too. He was a USSR military commander at a nearby airbase when the Chernobyl power plant exploded on 26 April 1986 and he was one of the first on the scene. He repeatedly travelled into the disaster zone helping to organise the clean-up operation with little understanding of the dangers while his wife and young sons were only 60 miles away. Vladimir died from lymph node cancer aged 64 which doctors linked to his exposure to radiation. A decade on from their father’s death the Klitschko brothers are now taking up arms after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “I don’t have another choice I have to do that I’ll be fighting” the 50-year-old Vitali now mayor of Kyiv said on Friday.

They grew up with strong military influence and under the impression the United States could unleash catastrophic war at any moment. Younger brother Wladimir told Grantland in 2011: “When I was 12 I was shooting AK-47s handling hand grenades running through underground tunnels practicing drills and studying how to get along with tank attacks.”

They took up combat sports from an early age: Vitali competed in boxing kickboxing and karate with great success in all three while Wladimir began his boxing training in Brovary on the outskirts of Kyiv before moving to Warsaw to work with better coaches. Aged 17 he became the heavyweight Junior European Champion and two years later his older brother Vitali won gold at the 1996 Military World Games in Rome.

That year Vitali also graduated from university and began his postgraduate course which would earn him a PhD in sports science; Wladimir achieved the same qualification earning them the boxing nicknames Dr Steelhammer and Dr Ironfist.

Two glittering boxing careers followed as they embarked on an era of dominance for more than a decade from the turn of the century (they kept a promise to their mother never to fight each other). Vitali became a heavyweight world champion in 1999 but famously lost to Lennox Lewis in Los Angeles in 2003 one of only two defeats; despite a long career spanning three decades Vitali was never once knocked down. Wladimir first became world champion in 2000 and later unified the division before a string of successful title defences before eventually succumbing to Tyson Fury in Germany in 2015.

Out of the ring Wladimir began a relationship with diminutive American actress Hayden Panettiere creating an eye-catching height difference between the 6ft 6in boxer and the 5ft star of NBC show Heroes. The pair who have a daughter together became engaged before separating in 2018. Vitali married Russian model and tennis player Natalia Egorova and they have three children who have grown up knowing only a free independent Kyiv.

Vitali moved into politics near the end of his boxing career first as advisor to president Viktor Yushenko and later as mayor of the capital. Both brothers were prominent in the 2013 Euromaiden protests the public backlash after president Viktor Yanukovych refused to sign a deal with the European Union and instead chose closer ties with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Yanukovych was overthrown and Putin has resented the loss of an ally leading Ukraine ever since.

“My whole life I was told that the US was a horrible country” Vitali told Grantland. “At some point I always believed I would have to defend my home country against crazy Americans who wanted to control the whole world.” The Klitschkos are now defending their home country but it is the nation their father proudly fought for that they fight to resist.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAyLzI3L3dhbnQtMTAwMC1tb250aGx5LWRpdmlkZW5kLWluY29tZS1oaWdoLXlpZWxkLXN0b2NrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Want $1000 in Monthly Dividend Income? This Ultra-High-Yield Stock Duo Can Make It Happen.,"These premium dividend stocks with yields of 11.3% and 8.9% will pad you pocketbooks every month.

For the past eight weeks Wall Street and investors have been offered a reminder that stocks can go down just as easily as they can rise. Both the benchmark S&P 500 and growth stock-driven Nasdaq Composite are mired in their steepest corrections since the pandemic-related crash of February-March 2020.

When the stock market tumbles investors rightly look for safe-havens to put their money to work. Perhaps no investment strategy has proved more fruitful over long periods than buying dividend stocks.

Dividend stocks offer a long history of outperformance

Nine years ago J.P. Morgan Asset Management a division of JPMorgan Chase released a report comparing the performance of publicly traded companies that initiated and grew their payout over 40 years (1972-2012) to public companies that didn't pay a dividend over the same period. The result was a landslide outperformance for the income stocks with an annualized return of 9.5% compared to 1.6% for the non-dividend payers.

These results aren't too shocking given that dividend stocks are almost always profitable time-tested businesses with transparent long-term outlooks.

The challenge for income investors arises from balancing yield and risk. Ideally dividend investors want the highest yield possible with the least risk. However data has shown that risk and yield tend to go hand-in-hand once a company reaches high-yield status (4% and above). Since yield is a function of payout relative to share price a struggling company with a falling share price can sometimes trick income investors into thinking they're getting a great deal.

The good news is that there are ultra-high-yield dividend stocks (those with yields above 7%) investors can trust. In fact there are even ultra-high-yield stocks that'll pay you monthly rather than every three months!

If you want $1000 in monthly dividend income here are two ultra-high-yield stocks that can deliver.

AGNC Investment Corp.: $106300 initial investment needed (11.29% yield)

First up is arguably the most well-known monthly dividend payer with an ultra-high yield AGNC Investment Corp. (AGNC 1.49%). Based on the company's 11.29% yield as of Feb. 23 an initial investment of $106300 would net approximately $1000 in monthly income.

AGNC is a mortgage real estate investment trust (REIT). In easy-to-understand terms it seeks to borrow money at lower short-term lending rates then uses this capital to purchase higher-yielding long-term assets like mortgage-backed securities (MBS). The average yield it receives from MBSs minus the average borrowing rate equates to the company's net interest margin (NIM). As you might imagine the wider the NIM the more profitable AGNC can be.

At the moment AGNC and its mortgage REIT peers are entering a period of uncertainty. Since the industry is often very interest-sensitive rising rates have a tendency to increase short-term borrowing costs. Couple the prospect of higher interest rates with a flattening yield curve in recent weeks and AGNC has a recipe for shrinking book value. Mortgage REIT share prices often hover close to their respective book values.

While this might not sound appealing to income seekers I'm probably making it sound worse than it is. Although book value could be pressured in the short-term the interest rate yield curve has historically spent far more time steepening (i.e. widening) than flattening. As interest rates rise it'll actually boost the average yield AGNC nets from future MBS purchases. In other words patient income investors should observe healthy NIM expansion over time.

What's more AGNC Investment has a habit of sticking to safe assets. At the end of 2021 the company held $82 billion in its investment portfolio $79.7 billion of which were agency securities. An agency asset is backed by the federal government in the unlikely event of a default. While this added protection does lower the yield on the MBSs AGNC buys it's also the catalyst that allows the company to utilize leverage to its advantage.

AGNC has averaged a double-digit yield in 12 of the past 13 years making it an ideal source of monthly income and a solid way to outpace high inflation.

PennantPark Floating Rate Capital: $135000 initial investment needed (8.89% yield)

A second ultra-high-yield stock income investors can trust to bring home the bacon is business development company PennantPark Floating Rate Capital (PFLT 1.05%). Based on a dividend yield of 8.89% an initial investment of $135000 would produce $1000 in monthly income.

PennantPark's operating model is relatively straightforward. It almost exclusively invests in first-lien secured debt of middle-market companies with much smaller holdings in equity investments such as preferred stock. A middle-market business is a public company with a small-cap ($300 million to $2 billion) or micro-cap (under $300 million) valuation.

Why middle-market companies? The simple answer is their financing options tend to be limited based on their size and/or unproven/non-time-tested business models. As a result PennantPark receives higher yields on the debt it holds. Assuming these companies make their interest payments it's a very profitable venture.

The good news is PennantPark's investment portfolio offers no concerns from the perspective of credit quality. As of the end of 2021 just two of the companies 110 company-based investments were delinquent on their payments which PennantPark refers to as ""non-accrual."" This work out to less than 3% of the value of its investment portfolio. Meanwhile it's generating well over a 7% average yield on its outstanding debt investments.

But what's arguably the most exciting aspect of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital (and is alluded to in the company's name) is that 99% of its debt investments are of the variable-rate variety. With inflation hitting a 40-year high in January it's all but certain that the Federal Reserve will be hiking lending rates to cool off the rate at which prices are rising. As rates climb so will the yields PennantPark is netting on its debt investments.

With profit expansion on the horizon the company's monthly payout of $0.095 appears safely locked in.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL2hlYXJ0bGFuZC5vcmcvcHVibGljYXRpb25zL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC1pbnN0aXR1dGlvbnMtYXJlLWV4cGFuZGluZy1lc2ctc29jaWFsLWNyZWRpdC1zY29yZXMtdG8tdGFyZ2V0LWluZGl2aWR1YWxzLXNtYWxsLWJ1c2luZXNzZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are Financial Institutions Using ESG Social Credit Scores to Coerce Individuals Small Businesses? – The Heartland ...,"Environmental social and governance (ESG) metrics are a kind of social credit system designed to coerce businesses—and by extension individuals and all of society—to transform their practices.

Through a carrot-and-stick approach investors and banks (and soon governments) use ESG to push businesses to change how they function regardless of what the employees and customers of those businesses want. In many cases however corporate executives are all too willing to go along because they want access to the cheap capital offered by investors and financial institutions.

The widespread adoption of ESG metrics which is also commonly called “stakeholder capitalism”—is meant to radically alter how businesses are evaluated expanding considerations beyond traditional economic metrics like profit revenue debt customer satisfaction and product development.

Instead of looking at economic and financial considerations ESG social credit metrics measure things like “Percentage of active workforce covered under collective bargaining agreements” (union labor) and “Percentage of employees per employee category by age group gender and other indicators of diversity (e.g. ethnicity).”

(To learn more about the basics of ESG read my ESG primer here or watch my recorded presentation for The Heartland Institute here.)

Unlike many corporations which spend substantial time and resources self-reporting ESG individual investors and most small businesses typically do not produce their own ESG reports. Instead large financial services companies and banks have produced them for these groups often without individuals or businesses asking for the reports.

For instance Merrill Lynch a division of Bank of America produces ESG scores for all or nearly all of its individual investment accounts even for those whose value is $1000 or less.

Moody’s has created an “ESG Score Predictor” that offers users with ESG reports for 100000 businesses many of which have never produced their own ESG metrics. Moody’s algorithm predicts scores by using “company size location and industry as inputs.”

When individuals and small businesses have raised concerns about the use of ESG and how it could be used against them—as opposed to merely being applied to corporations for the benefit of investors—banks investment groups and their lobbyists have claimed that concerns over ESG are nothing but “conspiracy theories.”

However the evidence shows that there are very good reasons to believe that financial institutions and banks plan to dramatically expand the use of ESG soon for individuals families and small businesses a move that would dramatically change the U.S. economy and society. Below are the five most important reasons for all Americans to be concerned.

1. There Are Already Many Examples of Individuals and Businesses Being Denied Access to Financial Services or Capital Based on Subjective Criteria

It’s impossible to know to what extent individuals organizations and businesses are now being denied access to financial services including loans based on subjective criteria because there are no databases nor reporting agencies tasked with compiling denials based on non-financial reasons. However news outlets have reported many examples of such actions and some industry reports openly admit that discrimination is common.

For example Deutsche Bank AG and Signature Bank announced in early 2021 that would no longer provide services to former President Donald Trump or his business the Trump Organization purely for ideological reasons.

In November 2021 WePay a J.P. Morgan Chase-owned payment processor informed the Missouri-based Defense of Liberty political action committee that it would stop offering its services to the organization after it planned an event featuring Donald Trump Jr. (Chase later reversed the decision but only after “Missouri treasurer Scott Fitzpatrick threatened to have the state stop doing business with the bank.”)

According to former North Dakota lawmaker Bette Grande “During the 2021 legislative session in North Dakota representatives of the lignite industry testified that coal operations are seeing increasing insurance premiums and a drop in the number of insurance companies willing to write insurance for any price. This is the ESG movement in action and it will not stop with oil and coal.”

Also in 2021 Sustainalytics an ESG business owned by Morningstar published a report titled How Sustainable Finance is Shaping Change in Banking. In the publication Sustainalytics notes:

Most major banks screen their lending portfolios against specific ESG risks as per the OECD Due Diligence guidance and many embrace negative or positive screening for potential corporate lending transactions or project finance transactions. Screening strategies filter potential transactions using predetermined ESG criteria to rule companies in or out of contention for financing. Negative screening and norm-based screening involve the exclusion or avoidance of transactions not aligned with environmental social and ethical standards. Exclusion criteria often include issues like weapon manufacturing tobacco sales or production of fossil fuels. While negative and norm-based screening are the most popular techniques used for ESG asset management these practices have been losing traction since 2015.

Positive screening on the other hand selects corporate borrowers that score highly on ESG factors relative to their peers. This can include best-in-class screening or the inclusion of investments in companies and sectors with higher ESG scores as compared to their peers or companies that are actively improving their ESG performance. This screening method does not necessarily exclude ESG laggards but rather focuses on those performing best with regards to ESG in relation to comparable companies or industries. In comparison to corporate lending transactions the intensity of screening is often higher for project finance transactions given due diligence requirements under the Equator Principles.

In 2020 Wells Fargo suspiciously closed a bank account belonging to Lauren Witzke a 2020 Republican candidate for the Delaware Senate.

The Heritage Foundation noted in a 2021 report that “PayPal has admitted to closing accounts flagged by the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2019 now PayPal has announced a partnership with the left-leaning Anti-Defamation League to focus on ‘further uncovering and disrupting the financial pipelines that support extremist and hate movements.'”

In 2019 the New York Post reported that J.P. Morgan Chase closed bank accounts associated with several political activists and commentators including Enrique Tarrio Joe Biggs Laura Loomer and Martina Markota—all within weeks of each other. According to the Post the activists said they were not given clear explanations for the cancellations.

In 2018 some large U.S. banks including Citibank rolled out restrictions for gun manufacturers and retailers. According to a report by the New York Times “They are restricting their credit card and banking services to gun retailers and halting lending to gun makers that do not comply with age limits and background check rules determined by the banks. They are also freezing out businesses that sell high-capacity magazines and ‘bump stocks’ attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire faster even though such products are legal under federal law.”

2. Credit Agencies Have Started to Alter Businesses’ Credit Ratings Based on ESG Scores

As noted in a 2021 sweeping report by Fitch Ratings—one of the “big three credit rating agencies” (along with Moody’s and S&P)—corporate credit rating agents already take ESG scores into account. And according to Fitch and others the use of ESG to alter credit ratings will almost certainly expand in the months and years to come.

If the largest agencies are willing to use ESG to alter corporate credit scores why wouldn’t credit agencies and banks do the same for individuals and small businesses?

3. Analysts Predict Individual Credit Scores Could Soon Have an ESG Component

Perhaps the most widely used service to check the creditworthiness of individuals and small business is FICO. When banks and credit unions examine applications for loans FICO is often the first place they turn. In an article published in December 2021 on FICO’s website titled “Lending Predictions 2022: From BNPL to ESG (and More)” a FICO senior principal consultant wrote that he believes in 2022 “The ESG Agenda Will Drive the Search for Cleaner Decisions.”

“In financial institutions much of the ESG agenda is delivered at the corporate level” the analyst wrote “but in 2022 we expect to see an increased focus on bringing ESG data into more granular lending and investment decisions. This will require increased innovation in the use of alternative data across all kinds of lending. One example would be the inclusion of property energy ratings data in mortgage valuation and decisioning and CO2 emission data for small businesses.”

He also noted “Over the longer term we expect that ESG and climate risk evaluations will become an integral element of credit risk and affordability assessments.”

This is a clear admission that ESG will likely soon be applied to individual and small business credit scores and/or other considerations such as mortgage applications.

4. Large Investment Management Firms and Banks Are Using ESG to Coerce Corporations

The primary stated purpose of ESG is to change corporations especially the largest and most powerful ones in order to produce more extensive societal impacts. This point is not in dispute. Everyone who understands ESG regardless of whether they support it or not agrees that it’s being used to alter corporate activities.

If you’re looking for specific examples of this however a good place to start is Larry Fink’s 2022 “Letter to CEOs” in which Fink sings the praises of “stakeholder capitalism” and promises to use ESG scores as a way to alter society. Fink is the head of Blackrock the world’s largest asset management company and is widely considered one of the most powerful people on Wall Street if not the most powerful person.

Of course Fink attempts to put a happy face on ESG and stakeholder capitalism throughout his letter but even he can’t help himself when discussing climate change making it clear that companies must choose between being leaders or being dragged into a net-zero economy against their will.

“Every company and every industry will be transformed by the transition to a net zero world” Fink wrote. “The question is will you lead or will you be led?”

The threats from Fink and others have largely worked. Accounting firm KPMG reports thousands of companies in dozens of countries have ESG systems in place including 82 percent of large companies in the United States. (And this data is now a couple of years old.)

If investors and banks are willing to utilize ESG to control corporations why wouldn’t they use ESG to manipulate individual and small business behavior as well?

5. Banks Have Promised to Use ESG to Fight Climate Change Throughout All of Their Portfolios and Business Activities

The largest and most influential banks and financial institutions in the United States much of Europe and Canada have openly said that they will use their tremendous amount of wealth to force the global economy to move to net-zero by at least 2050 and to halve CO2 emissions by 2030. This will be done in a variety of ways including by “accelerating decarbonization in the real economy by describing financial sector expectations of transition plans from the companies the sector engages with and finances.”

One of the largest groups of banks and financial institutions promising to make such an extreme acceleration is the Glasgow Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ). There are already “over 450 financial firms across 45 countries responsible for assets of over $130 trillion” in GFANZ including numerous large U.S. banks such as Bank of America J.P. Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo & Company.

There simply is no way for banks to keep their promises related to a transition to net-zero without imposing ESG metrics or other similar criteria on individuals and small businesses.

Open RAN the edge private networks and new technologies in chip and radio processing.

If you don’t receive TMN’s newsletter then it’s very easy to get signed up. Just need a name and an email.

1. HPE goes private

HPE took the wraps off new private networks products that it says differs from other private mobile network offerings in two ways.

One it has designed an interface to enable enterprises and IT managers that are more used to WiFi to get a degree of control over the deployment. It’s a question of balance TMN was told. Businesses don’t need the same level of control over the core network as an MNO but they do need some visibility into the setup provisioning users and selecting core functions to invoke.

Second the set-up is designed to work together with WiFi with cross-network authentication and session handover for users and devices using Aruba AirPass.

HPE has worked with radio vendors to make its core software stack available as an in-a-box capability based on the HPE Edgeline EL8000 Converged Edge system or as a distributed cloud option that has user functions at the edge and central control functions further back in the network. It said that it is working with radio vendors to pre-validate the solution to reduce time to market for enterprises. Airspan is one vendor it has named so far.

2. Intel fights back on vRAN

Intel which faces attacks from rival chip vendors and also from some operators that its architecture is challenged by vRAN workloads said that its new Saphhire Rapids design would deliver up to two times capacity gains for virtual radio access network (vRAN) deployments.

The company said that new 5G-specific signal processing instruction enhancements in the Sapphire Rapids core – built to support RAN-specific signal processing – will deliver up to two times capacity gains for vRAN and support advanced capabilities like high-cell density for 64T64R Massive MIMO.In addition the Sapphire Rapids family will be built out with new chips with integrated acceleration that are optimised for vRAN workloads.

That forms an Intel fightback not that it would support that sort of messaging against “inline” acceleration from the likes of Qualcomm and Marvel as well as growing support for ARM based sikutions to support specific vRAN workloads.

vRAN wasn’t the only thing on Intel’s mind. It was also discussing new platforms for advanced inferencing aengines at the edge and also to support User Plane Functions in its Smart Edge portfolio. You can see all Intel’s MWC22 press materials here.

3. Marvell powers Dell Open RAN card

We weren’t making it up about Marvell. This week it announced the Dell Open RAN Accelerator Card – a new in-line 5G Layer 1 processing card for vRAN products.

Designed for Dell PowerEdge and other x86-based servers the PCIe accelerator card is based on Marvell’s OCTEON Fusion chip.

Raj Singh executive vice president Processors Business Unit at Marvell said “The new Dell Open RAN Accelerator Card is an innovative no-compromise cloud-native inline Open RAN Layer 1 acceleration solution that addresses the shortcomings of existing vRAN alternatives.”

Last week’s newsletter carried news of a similar product to Dell’s coming from HPE. HPE said it was bringing a new vDU to market inserting an accelerator card based on Qualcomm’s X100 5G RAN into the HPE ProLiant DL110 Gen10 Plus Telco Server. Dell’s accelerator card is designed for x86 servers including Dell’s of course.

The announcement got the nod of approval from Vodafone’s Andy Dunkin who has been leading on Open RAN solutions at the operator for years now. SoC and silicon support for vRAN and Open vRAN workloads has been an issue for operators for a while now – keep an eye this week for more announcements or announcements about announcements!

4. A5G but what 5G?

Semi-stealth start-up A5G Networks formed by former Parallel Wireless brains said it was in a pilot for a private networks use case with Vodafone India (Vi). It describes its software as enabling a network of networks via cloud core software analytics and optimisation.

TMN is speaking to A5G at MWC next week where we hope to discover just a little bit more about what this means.

5. Love this stuff

You may have heard of 5G Standalone. That’s the option that lets 5G radio networks exist without requiring an anchor connection to the 4G Core (the other mode is known as NonStandalone – NSA).

Well this being telecoms there are in fact different ways of implementing 5G SA. Of course there are.

This week Samsung and SKT said they had implemented Option 4 (a 3GPP specified option for deploying SA) that is also known as NE-SA. This connects the 5G and the 4G radios to the same 5G core. This being telecoms the N stands for New Radio and the E stands for E-UTRAN which of course means LTE which as you know means 4G. Well don’t blame us.

Look what it means is that an operator could connect its 4G and 5G radios simultaneously to the 5G core meaning a user can get LTE and 5G connectivity at the same time. It’s a bit like EN-DC which is the means by which operators with NSA networks give users dual connectivity (DC) to LTE (E) and 5G (N) networks. But instead of the LTE node acting as the “master” the operator uses the 5G radio and core as the boss. Why? Well it means that it can then invoke 4G capacity say at lower frequency bands for a 5G service or in time a 5G slice.

6. Ethernity – still like that name

Pleasingly named Ethernity said that it will have a new Disaggregated Cell Site Gateway product available in July. DSCG’s are products developed in line with TIP’s requirements giving operators an open programmable backhaul and cell site router option with which to link radio units with the core network.

The new product – UEP2025 – will have multiple 10/25 GbE ports and is powered by a single FPGA SoC implementing both the CSR data plane and the link bonding (wired and wireless connections).

Ethernity CEO David Levi said “UEP2025 is the ultimate tool in enabling a truly disaggregated Radio Access Network. While other vendors have L1 bonding features they lock the service providers into using their proprietary radio. Ethernity offers service providers more flexibility and choice in which wired or wireless radios they use in planning their network infrastructure.”

7. A plan coming together?

Bridge Alliance MobiledgeX Singtel and Telefonica have interconnected two MEC platforms as part of a GSMA Foundry Telco Edge Cloud trial.

Singtel’s MEC and Telefonica’s MEC are connected by Bridge Alliance’s Federated Edge Hub and MobiledgeX Edge-Cloud platform respectively. With the interconnection Singtel’s customers will be able to deploy edge applications on Telefonica’s MEC and vice versa

The GSMA Foundry Telco Edge Cloud (TEC) project brings the industry together to collaborate around a number of pre-commercial trials of Telco Edge Cloud capabilities with app developers and service providers.

The Bridge Alliance FEH is a platform that interconnects the MEC of its member operators. MobiledgeX’s federation capabilities enable mobile operators using its Edge-Cloud platform to interact with other operator platform instances.

GSMA kicked off activities over two years ago to try and federate mobile operator edge networks and get a consistency of development platform a couple of years back. Notable that it has some projects to talk about this week as the public cloud players make further incursions into the sector. MobiledgeX whose CEO Jason Hoffman heads up the technical bit of this programme has talked before about the potential operators to use the edge as part of a unified cloud strategy. That means building a cloud that is native to edge and not an edge that is native to cloud! And here’s Hoffman outlining that to TMN here.

8. STL ought to run deep

Indian company STL has announced a strong new roster of 5G and Open RAN products which will form part of its 5G showcase exhibited at #MWC22.These include new small cells (announced November 2021) new O-RUs a RIC offering and programmable FTTx.

Really interesting range of products:

Garuda: New open and virtualized indoor 5G solution for enterprises

Firebird: New multi-band macro O-RAN compliant radio units (O-RUs) for wide area 5G coverage

RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC): A cloud-native component for near real-time monitoring and optimisation of RAN

Programmable FTTx: Cloud virtualized wireless access solution for fibre networks

9. Nokia UBT radio

Nokia has a new backhaul radio the UBT-T XP Dual Band radio. The dual bands are at 6 GHz and 11 GHz with a 2.5Gbps capacity.

10. Pharrowtech ploughs mmWave field

mmWave chip designer Pharrowtech launched the PTR1060 which it says is “the world’s first IEEE 802.11ay-compliant CMOS RF chip for indoor and outdoor wireless use cases that supports the full 57 to 71 GHz bandwidth”.

You’re looking at applications such as Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) deployments 5G and WiFi infrastructure backhauling and IoT devices requiring high-speed links.

Pharrowtech is also launching its new PTM1060 (RFM) phased array antenna module which includes the PTR1060. When combined with Renesas’ RWM6050 baseband it offers ODM/OEMs a ready-to-use 60GHz solution.

11. OpenBeam opens up Open RU choice

Mavenir packaged up the O-RAN compliant Radio Units (RUs) that it inter-operates with into an RU portfolio called OpenBeam. The idea is clearly to showcase the width of choice that operators have to match Mavenir O-DU/ O-CU software with radio units.

“We have engaged with customers globally to curate a comprehensive O-RAN portfolio that addresses the needs of both private enterprises as well as traditional communication providers” says Rajesh Srinivasa Senior Vice President of Radio Business Unit at Mavenir.

“OpenBeam portfolio covers a wide range of deployment scenarios starting from micro-RUs to 64TR Massive MIMO Radios. OpenBeam radios deliver industry-leading performance and energy efficiency packed in a small footprint.”

12. DT and Ericsson slicing

Ericsson and DT have demonstrated slice management end to end across borders. Using Ericsson core software a user plane function was placed in Poland and managed by an Ericsson orchestrator in Deutsche Telekom’s network in Germany. An SD-WAN was used to control access in the international set-up giving the carrier the ability to offer multi-national coordinated slice control.

DT seems to be one of the operators most committed to proving out slicing capabilities and here used APIs from TM Forum to interface with the network functions.

13. Starting up Liquid Crystal

Smart antenna start-up ALCAN Systems has said that Liquid Crystal-based technology can be integrated into a range of telecom antenna solutions to help deliver mmWave deployments.

ALCAN came out of Darmstadt University with 14 year’s research behind it. I was established to develop Liquid Crystal (LC) based phased array smart antennas. ALCAN says this offers electronically reconfigurable beam-steering technology at a lower cost compared with typical silicon-based options. The antennas can be integrated into CPE repeater and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Based antennas (RIS) along with land mobile solutions.

The technology has previously been used to serve the satellite market but with Liquid Crystal allowing for a naturally low-profile form factor at a relatively low cost ALCAN thinks it might enable more economical mmWave 5G equipment.

Onur Hamza Karabey CEO said “To deliver mmWave 5G at scale still remains a huge challenge. At ALCAN we’ve recognized the pain points of mmWave 5G delivery and developed smart antennas to address them.”

14. Mo’ money mo’ spectrum

Cohere Technologies announced new money and new product this week. The money – $46 million – came from a range of backers including Koch Investments Group which has an existing stake now in Mavenir. Other investors included VMware and Juniper Networks who have both engaged with Cohere on trials of their RIC platform and Intel Capital.

The product came in the form of a new capability to apply its technology across FDD 4G and 5G TDD radio. Cohere says it can double spectral efficiency by using its delay doppler-based channel predictions. It makes this available as a Spectrum Multiplier xApp or as technology that can be integrated by radio vendors.

15. TIP gets busy

The Telecom Infra Project (TIP) OpenRAN Project Group has just published its Release 2 Roadmap Document.

Last June TIP published the ‘Open RAN Technical Priorities Document’ – a list of technical requirements that the signatories of the Open RAN MoU Group (Deutsche Telekom Orange Telefónica TIM and Vodafone) considered priorities for Open RAN architecture. Building on that work the OpenRAN Project Group invited community participants to provide feedback resulting in over 40 ecosystem responses.

The publication of the OpenRAN Release 2 Roadmap harmonises the prioritised operator requirements with vendors’ product readiness. The idea is to enable Project Group activities to proceed more efficiently while also providing a path to commercialiszation via TIP’s Test and Validation framework.

TIP is also releasing Release 2 roadmaps and Technical Requirements Documents 2.0 for the RU DU/CU RIA and ROMA OpenRAN PG subgroups.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s the first foray into the reusable period and incontinence underwear category for the company which is behind Kleenex tissues Huggies diapers and Kotex feminine products. Kimberly-Clark first took a minority share in Thinx back in 2019.

Sanitary underwear has picked up steam in the last few years. The global period panties market is projected to reach $79.3 million by the end of 2026 up from $67.2 million in 2017 according to Transparency Market Research. Some of the world’s biggest brands have also gotten into the category. Last year Uniqlo and Aerie owned by American Eagle Outfitters launched their own collections of sanitary underwear too.

More people have started using menstrual product alternatives during the pandemic. Extra time at home has allowed people to try out other methods without the fear of accidental leaks.

“With the continued advancement of hybrid environments more consumers are staying and working from home and they are demonstrating increased awareness and consideration for the category” the company said announcing the deal. “Market trends also confirm consumers are seeking these additional solutions for their period and bladder leak needs.”

That said period panties are only a tiny sliver of the overall global feminine hygiene market which was valued at $19.24 billion in 2020. Pads and tampons remain the top choices for most women around the world.

Makers of sanitary underwear however say their products offer a range of benefits including greater comfort and absorbing capacity than pads while avoiding toxic shock syndrome an uncommon but potentially fatal side effect of tampon use.

Sustainability is also a major selling point. A woman is expected to use over 11000 menstrual products in their lifetime (pdf) which creates a lot of waste particularly plastic. Reusable products like period underwear and menstrual cups could also help make feminine care products more affordable. Many women and girls in developing nations struggle to afford pads and tampons a trend that’s been exacerbated by recent supply chain issues.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vYmdyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9vbmUtb2YtY29zdGNvcy1iaWdnZXN0LXNlY3JldHMtd2FzLWp1c3QtcmV2ZWFsZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,One of Costco's biggest secrets was just revealed,"It’s only recently that I’ve discovered just how passionate Costco’s loyal fan base is for the membership-only retail chain. There are blogs and websites for example dedicated solely to the chain and the comings and goings within its product assortment. Social media accounts also promote changes in that product availability in addition to touting the myriad deals that shoppers quickly pounce on. And then there’s the Costco Kirkland Signature brand.

This in-house Costco product line is so huge that just a few years ago? The Wall Street Journal was reporting around 25 percent of Costco’s $118.7 billion in annual sales came from Kirkland Signature products. Basically the line offers generic versions of established products people can buy on the cheap. Moreover here’s the secret that casual Costco shoppers might not be aware of. Many Kirkland Signature products are actually generic versions made by the same companies behind the original.

Costco’s Kirkland Signature products

Here’s how the chain describes its exclusive private label house brand. “In 1995” a summary from the chain reads “Costco began the Kirkland Signature line after recognizing a need for better quality goods at a greater value. Our mission was simple: Create an item of the same — or better — quality than the leading brand at a lower price and do so by controlling every element of the item’s creation including packaging and transportation.

Tech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. Email: SIGN UP By signing up I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.

“The end result: Kirkland Signature products are incredible quality goods at simply excellent prices.”

Along these lines here’s an example of the secret we alluded to above. Costco CEO Craig Jelinek confirmed that Duracell actually makes the Kirkland Signature alkaline batteries available to Costco shoppers. Likewise Huggies maker Kimberly-Clark also makes Kirkland Signature-branded diapers while Kirkland Signature jelly beans are a product of — who else? — the popular Jelly Belly brand.

Other Costco products

On the beverage front big names like Starbucks and Ocean Spray are also involved with the Costco Kirkland Signature line. Say you pick up one of the many Kirkland Signature coffee bags available to buy for example. It will likely declare right there on the package that Starbucks is the source. Likewise Ocean Spray makes the Kirkland Signature cranberry juice available at Costco.

If other Kirkland Signature products also look familiar here’s why. Per The Journal before Costco goes down this road and develops a generic version of a product through its private label? The chain will often turn to a brand name first. They’re given an opportunity to produce the Kirkland Signature version presumably to keep their hand in the quality even of this ancillary product.

Some companies agree some decline. Something to consider next time you’re walking down the aisle and one of these items catches your eye.

Vice President Yemi Osinbajo yesterday inaugurated Kimberly Clark’s new Huggies Diaper Manufacturing Plant in Ikorodu Lagos State.

The company has invested over $100m in building a state-of-the-art Huggies diaper manufacturing facility in Odogunyan Ikorodu Lagos with the capacity to create over 1000 direct and indirect jobs that can grow to 5000 within 3-5 years of operation.

The factory would avail the youths in Ikorodu Federal Constituency and indeed Lagos-Nigeria at large ample opportunities within the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry.

Speaking as a special guest at the event Vice President Osinbajo said “This plant I am told would serve Nigerian consumers with affordable high-quality diapers and I am told it will produce something in the order of about 600 million diapers every year.

“I am also told that with our seven million babies born every year we are just two million behind the Chinese so we are really the largest possible market for diapers in the world coming second only to the Chinese.

“So I think Kimberly – Clark has chosen a very good place. We are told also that this will provide thousands of jobs and I believe that the first thousand are already in place and we expect a further couple of thousands in the next three years.”

The Vice President noted that for the federal government “every new manufacturing plant is an important step toward our belief that it is private investment but local and foreign that must be the pathway to rapid economic growth with jobs and prosperity.”

Osinbajo expressed the success of the plant depends greatly on the conscious reliance on the private enterprise and initiative adding it only makes sense that the private sector is given every encouragement to play that role.

“And this commitment of the federal government is expressed in the strategic objectives of the plan which include establishing a strong foundation for a diversified economy investing in critical infrastructure – roads rails power and broadband; enabling human capital development and improving governance and strengthening security.”

He said further that the implementation of the plan is expected to be supported by a range of fiscal monitoring and trade measures including more intentionally promoting productivity and value addition.

“The central thought behind the plan is that we must improve productivity and value addition” Osinbajo added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3RyaWJ1bmVvbmxpbmVuZy5jb20vbmV3LTEwMG0taWtvcm9kdS1wbGFudC13aWxsLW1ha2UtbmlnZXJpYS1leHBvcnQtaHViLWZvci1hZnJpY2Etc29vbi0lRTIlODAlOTUta2ltYmVybHktY2xhcmstbmlnZXJpYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New $100m Ikorodu plant will make Nigeria export hub for Africa soon ― Kimberly-Clark Nigeria,"Besides reiterating the company’s confidence in the nation’s business environment the management of Kimberly-Clark Nigeria has said its newly-commissioned diaper and sanitary pad brands plant in Ikorodu Lagos would also enable Nigeria to serve as an export hub for Africa in the near future.

The General Manager Kimberly-Clark Nigeria Vani Malik made this assertion at the commissioning of the state-of-the-art $100m plant over the weekend.

While reiterating the company’s commitment to investing in the country’s socio-economic development and growth Malik argued that it had been the company’s long-term objective to strengthen its presence and investments in Nigeria.

She expressed the belief that with the commissioning of the new facility ten years after opening its door for business in the country the company had demonstrated its commitment to the implementation of the nation’s roadmap for industrialization to create jobs substitute imports and boost exports.

“This is a symbol of our commitment to our global vision of providing Better Care for a Better World. In Nigeria we fulfil that vision by supporting babies women mothers and young girls” she added.

IN CASE YOU MISSED THESE FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE

Acting Vice President Chief Financial Officer Kimberly-Clark Middle East and Africa Fernando Baticon attributed the decision of the company to site the facility spanning an impressive 14800m² area of a total land plot of 86000m in Nigeria to the importance of the Nigerian market to Kimberly-Clark.

“Nigeria is one of our top priority markets. This is one of our most substantial investments on the continent to increase and strengthen our presence here. Our new state-of-the-art mill is a symbol of our commitment to this country and the opportunity for growth that exists” he added.

Baticon further stated that the company which began its operations in Nigeria in 2012 with the introduction of Huggies diapers in 2015 and Kotex sanitary pads in 2019 had continued to create impact not only through high quality and affordable products but also through associated initiatives geared towards improving the lives of young girls and expectant mothers.

Ahead of the expiration of their union contract 60000 grocery workers at subsidiaries of Kroger and Albertsons in California are holding actions outside stores demanding at least a $5 wage increase over three years improved safety and security for workers improved staffing and eliminating the two-tier system of workers.

James Peete has worked as a food clerk at Ralphs a subsidiary of Kroger in Glendale California for nine years. During the pandemic Peete claimed his department and store has been understaffed to a skeleton crew.

“When we had a lot of people out with Covid I was working 12 to 15 hours six days a week and so were many of my co-workers” said Peete.

Peete said that with every new contract Ralphs tries to expand the classification of workers under general merchandise which pays less at $16 an hour forcing many workers to work multiple jobs to make ends meet.

When the City of Los Angeles enacted a $5 an hour hazard pay for grocery workers for four months in early 2021 Kroger shut down three local stores and Peete argued management pressured workers to ramp up production during those periods.

“In their most profitable years ever closing stores down to punish us for getting hazard pay definitely ruined morale. Like many of my coworkers when we got that $5 an hour pay increase temporarily we were pushed incredibly hard” Peete said.

Grocery workers around the US have expressed similar grievances throughout the pandemic as pay has lagged behind while these workers were expected to continue working throughout the pandemic with thousands of workers contracting the virus and workers frequently facing abuse and assaults from customers over enforcing safety protocols.

John Grant the president of UFCW Local 770 union argued the Covid-19 pandemic revealed how indispensable grocery workers are to the communities they serve and their employers while putting themselves at risk for wages that aren’t enough to make ends meet.

“This is the opportunity to rebalance the work in the grocery industry” said Grant. “These used to be career jobs where people could sustain their family live the American dream of being able to support themselves and send their kids to college and it’s just been ripped apart and gutted. Companies can’t claim any longer an inability to pay or hide behind some economically thin margins. Their profits are obscene.”

Kroger reported profits of $2.8bn in 2020. In 2021 Kroger reported even higher profits in its first three quarters of the year with its fourth quarter results expected to be released in early March. The company authorized a $1bn stock buyback program in 2021.

Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen received $22.4m in compensation in 2020 904 times the median worker pay.

Albertsons also reported record profits in 2020 of $850.2m after its stock first went public in June 2020 and has seen its stock price nearly double since then.

“We’re asking for at least $5 over three years. We’re simply trying to just make ends meet especially here in California being so expensive” said Christie Sasaki a cashier at Pavilions an Albertsons subsidiary in Beverly Hills California for more than 20 years. “We all work terribly hard in the grocery industry. It’s been a tough two years with the unknowns and Covid changing constantly. I go to work often in fear and hope that I don’t become ill or die.”

More than 8000 grocery workers represented by UFCW in Colorado went on strike at Kroger-owned subsidiaries in January 2022 while other UFCW local unions representing thousands of grocery workers are in the midst of new contract negotiations with Kroger and other grocery corporations.

Tina Sanchez who has worked as a service deli manager at Vons a subsidiary of Albertsons in Oxnard California for 22 years said the pandemic has been crazy for grocery workers as customers were hoarding food products and she was working 10- to 14-hour days to keep up with the surge in demand.

“A lot of us feel that it’s been profit over people. They got that money so quickly that they had never seen before and they just wanted more. They didn’t care that people were tired that I was working six seven 18 days in a row. It didn’t matter” said Sanchez.

Sanchez claimed her department is understaffed operating with three workers with limited hours when she used to run a crew of nine. She also explained the common cut injuries and dangers associated with working in the deli the risks she and other workers have taken while working through the pandemic as higher management workers in offices were able to work from home.

“We’ve had people that come into the store from higher management telling us ‘if you get that $5 an hour increase you are going to get less hours. Why is it a punishment to ask for something that we deserve?” she asked.

A spokesperson for Kroger said in an email the company is still negotiating with the unions and committed to reaching a new agreement for Ralphs associates claiming the average associate wage is nearly $19 an hour. But the firm did not add specifics on company proposals or comment on workers’ claims of understaffing and increased workloads.

“It’s important to note that more than 50% of our 17000 bargaining unit associates have been with the company for 10 or more years reflecting good stable jobs in southern California.

Customers have had to adjust to price inflation pandemic policies and product shortages; so it stands to reason why many stores haven't looked the same since the pre-pandemic era.

Several modifications are underway at many popular retailers. From new store locations to increase sustainability efforts these store enhancements could possibly be coming to a store near you. If names like Walmart Dollar General or Hy-Vee ring a bell stay tuned to discover exactly what changes are in store this year.

Late last year the company revealed that Idaho will be getting its first-ever Dollar General store making the Gem State the 47th state to have one. For now it seems that Montana Alaska and Hawaii are the only states without The low-cost chain.

Store locations aren't the only thing expanding however. Dollar General also wants to be known as a ""health destination"" for shoppers by increasing access to cough and cold medical and feminine hygiene products along with adding fresh produce at 10000 stores.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

William Henry Heller ""Bill"" passed away on February 20 2022 in Broomfield Colorado. He was 84 years old. Bill was born and raised in Idaho Springs Colorado the second son of Eva (Woodward) and Albert ""Bus"" Heller along with his brother Robert ""Bob"" Heller. After graduating from Clear Creek High School Bill attended the University of Colorado where he earned his Bachelors of Science degree in Business Administration and met his future wife Patricia (Banyai) Heller. Pat and Bill married in the fall of 1961 after graduation and immediately settled in Broomfield where they lived throughout 60 years of marriage and raised their three children Bill Tricia and John.

Bill spent the better part of his professional life in sales including owning his own business W.H. Sales Inc. In the early 70's he was instrumental in bringing snowmaking to the Colorado ski industry selling the snowmaking water pumps to several local mountain resorts as well as Sun Valley. He also worked at Kroger's for many years as well as holding a ""semi-retired"" position at Frontier Airlines. He held a number of different volunteer and board positions throughout his professional career and as someone with a rare blood type he was a regular and devoted blood donor. Bill was also quite the handyman putting skills and lessons learned at an early age while working in his father's Idaho Springs hardware store to practical use - from his uncanny zipper-repair ability to building a family cabin in Summit County.

The most notable things however about Bill Heller were his soft smile warm eyes strong stature sweet spirit and his willingness to lend a helping hand. He would greet you with an irresistible idiom and always bid you goodbye with the words ""God bless."" Bill was supportive and proud of his wife and kids' accomplishments and he always recounted a story with warmth and flare. He was an avid fan of his beloved Buffs and Broncos a proud 3rd generation native of Colorado a loyal and trusted friend a father figure to many an amazing athlete and a patient instructor and coach. But top of the list always was Bill's immense love of family.

Bill is survived by his wife Pat Heller; son Bill Heller (Niki Esmay Heller); daughter Tricia Heller (Regina Brown M.D.); son John Heller (Tara Grote Heller); brother Robert Heller; grandsons Rhody Griffin Connor and Blake; and many nieces nephews cousins and godchildren. All will miss his warmth and kindness but will forever feel his loving embrace.

Funeral services will be held Monday February 28 at 10:00am at Saint Louis Catholic Church in Louisville Colorado (preceded by Rosary at 9:30am) with a reception following at Gate-N-Green Clubhouse at 13405 Main Street in Broomfield. Private burial to follow at a later date at Broomfield County Commons Cemetery. In lieu of flowers the family requests donations IN MEMORY OF WILLIAM HELLER for either the Marshall Fire Assistance Fund at https://www.commfound.org/wildfirefund or The University of Colorado Cancer Foundation at https://giving.cu.edu/fund/lam-md-gu-research-fund.

Apollo Global Management and Las Vegas Sands Corp. said in separate statements that gamblers conventioneers and hotel guests should see few changes at the luxury hotel complex including the renamed Venetian Expo.

The names will remain the same and George Markantonis CEO of The Venetian Resort said the management team will stay in place.

""We have an exciting opportunity to build on our past successes while capturing future opportunities"" Markantonis said citing hospitality meetings and events gambling and entertainment.

New York-based VICI Properties acquired assets associated with the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the expo for $4 billion. Apollo Global Management bought Venetian operations for $2.25 billion.

Apollo executives told Nevada casino regulators earlier this month the company will step into an ongoing partnership with Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp. to continue with the development of the $1.9 billion 17500-seat MSG Sphere being built just east of The Venetian Expo the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.

Sands the company led by Sheldon Adelson until his death last year will effectively cease U.S. operations to focus on operations in Asia.

Patrick Dumont Sands president and chief operating officer pointed to a recently announced $1 billion reinvestment at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore and a $2.2 billion renovation of The Londoner Macao.

""The foundation of this company was built in Las Vegas and even though the overall size of the organization here will be smaller it is important to each of us that we continue to strongly support our community"" Dumont said.

Adelson bought the Sands hotel once a hangout for Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack in 1989 razed it and built a towering Italian-inspired complex featuring gondolas gliding on a stylized canal through an indoor plaza with stores restaurants and entertainment and outside near Las Vegas Boulevard pedestrians.

Today the Venetian and Palazzo have more than 7000 guest rooms sprawling casino and convention spaces and more than 8000 employees.

Adelson became a billionaire and Republican mega-donor. His family bought Nevada's largest newspaper the Las Vegas Review-Journal. He died in January 2021 at age 87 from complications related to treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. His wife Dr. Miriam Adelson remains the majority shareholder of Las Vegas Sands Corp.

""The opening of The Venetian more than 20 years ago represents the beginning of the company's success"" Las Vegas Sands Chairman and CEO Robert Goldstein said. ""The property and most importantly the people who represent it every day will always remain indelible parts of our history.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vc21jb3JyaWRvcm5ld3MuY29tL2xhcy12ZWdhcy1zYW5kcy1sYXVuY2hlcy0yLW1pbGxpb24tcGFjLXRvLWNvbnRpbnVlLWl0cy1wdXNoLXRvLWxlZ2FsaXplLWNhc2lub3MtaW4tdGV4YXMv0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly9zbWNvcnJpZG9ybmV3cy5jb20vbGFzLXZlZ2FzLXNhbmRzLWxhdW5jaGVzLTItbWlsbGlvbi1wYWMtdG8tY29udGludWUtaXRzLXB1c2gtdG8tbGVnYWxpemUtY2FzaW5vcy1pbi10ZXhhcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las Vegas Sands launches $2 million PAC to continue its push to legalize casinos in Texas,Las Vegas Sands launches $2 million PAC to continue its push to legalize casinos in Texas,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vY3VsdHVyZXNzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAyLzI3L3doZWVsLW9mLWZvcnR1bmUtY29udGVzdGFudC1hbnN3ZXItd3Jvbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wheel of Fortune contestant makes a dinosaur-sized mistake,Next.

Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash had a lot in common as contemporary rock and rollers based in Tennessee. The King and The Man in Black were famously part of the Million Dollar Quartet recordings along with Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins at Sun Record Studios back in 1956. The country singer’s son John Carter Cash exclusively told Express.co.uk how the pair were friendly but not so close during Elvis’ final years in the mid-late 1970s.

Cash’s son said: “They were contemporaries and were part of the driving force that created rock and roll. My dad and Elvis were friends; they worked side by side when Elvis was there at Sun records. [Of course] Elvis went on to make his films and some more music later on and they never worked again together after the 1950s. They each had their own individual unique traits as artists. Dad’s reached in different directions than Elvis’ did enduring a legacy as a long-standing artist having resurgences and renaissances throughout his life. Dad carried on and he made music up until the very end. In some way his legacy’s quite a bit different but he always appreciated and loved Elvis.”

READ MORE Elvis and June Carter: Her son suspected they had an affair In his 1997 biography Cash – who would have been 90 today had he not died in 2003 – shared fond memories of Elvis. The Man In Back wrote: “He and I liked each other but we weren't that tight - I was older than he was for one thing and married for another - and we weren't close at all in his later years. I took the hint when he closed his world around him; I didn't try to invade his privacy. I'm so glad I didn't either because so many of his old friends were embarrassed so badly when they were turned away at Graceland. In the '60s and '70s he and I chatted on the phone a couple of times and swapped notes now and again. If he were closing at the Las Vegas Hilton as I was getting ready to open he'd wish me luck that kind of thing - but that was about the extent of it.”

Elvis died in 1977 Johnny Cash in 2003

Cash continued: “I've heard it said that here at the end of the century we all have our own Elvis and I can appreciate that idea even though my Elvis was my friend flesh and blood in real life. Certainly though my Elvis was the Elvis of the '50s. He was a kid when I worked with him. He was nineteen years old and he loved cheeseburgers girls and his mother not necessarily in that order (it was more like his mother then girls then cheeseburgers). Personally I liked cheeseburgers and I had nothing against his mother but the girls were the thing. He had so many girls after him that whenever he was working with us there were always plenty left over. We had a lot of fun. We had a lot of fun in general not just with the girls. It was nice that we could make a living at it but every one of us would have done it for free. And you know Elvis was so good. Every show I did with him I never missed the chance to stand in the wings and watch. We all did. He was that charismatic.” DON'T MISS

Just as you’d expect from a large and international entity the truth can be found in the numbers. In the case of F1 though be certain of this: Short of a new pandemic motorsports’ most glamorous circuit should be operating in the black for years to come.

Formula 1 is an odd league by American standards. For all practical purposes the NFL NBA and Major League Baseball are owned by the teams. F1 has teams too but Liberty Media a U.S.-based corporation owns the series.

Among other properties Liberty Media owns the Atlanta Braves a majority stake in Sirius XM and a substantial piece of Live Nation Entertainment. In short they’re not in business to make money for other people without squireling away a few bucks of their own in the deal.

That’s what happened last season. In its most recent financial filing Liberty Media reported a profit of $92 million on revenue of $2.13 billion. That came on the heels of losing $386 million on revenue of $1.145 billion in 2020 according to AutoSport.com.

The difference was the pandemic. Formula 1 conducted 22 races around the world last year compared to 17 in 2020 when COVID-19 caused multiple cancellations. Each race that F1 had to scrap meant losses on multiple fronts: hosting fees paid by tracks broadcast revenue merchandising and sponsor payments.

Roughly half of F1’s money comes from hosting fees paid by the tracks and that line in the spreadsheet figures to grow quickly in the coming years.

Why did Formula 1 make so little money in such a big year?

Michael Andretti made news last week with the revelation that he is seeking to enter Formula 1 as an owner in 2024. A look at the money involved helps to explain why.

There are only 10 Formula 1 teams. Last year Liberty Media distributed an average of $106.8 million to each of them. That was half the money the organization took in and up sharply from the average of $71.1 million in 2020.

Finishing with a $92 million profit for the year essentially means that Formula 1 owner Liberty Media treated itself as an equal partner to the 10 teams that are led by juggernauts Mercedes Red Bull and Ferrari. And they didn’t have to dish out massive salaries to Lewis Hamilton Max Verstappen and Fernando Alonso.

There’s more money on the horizon

The financial report from Liberty Media cited revenue boosts from broadcast rights including a subscription television channel as one reason for the improved P&L picture last year. Sponsorship deals also helped as major corporations loosened the purse strings while returning to something closer to normal business operations.

The picture will continue to improve in coming years and the people calling the shots in F1 have last season’s memorable battle between Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton to thank. That’s because Formula 1 negotiates contracts of between five and 10 years with most of the tracks hosting races.

In any given year three or four tracks are up for renewal and Formula 1 raises the price. With the enormous additional interest that Verstappen’s series title over Hamilton generated in 2021 Liberty Media has been dealing from a position of strength in recent months.

In the United States alone F1 has recently finalized its deal to bring a race to Miami extended its contract with Circuit of the Americas and opened negotiations with organizers in Las Vegas. On top of that renewals with Singapore and Barcelona are complete and extensions for Monaco and venues in Bahrain Austria and Mexico are forthcoming.

According to RacingNews365.com the tracks in Qatar Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia are currently paying $55 million a year to host. European venues typically have been paying less than half that amount but they’ll need to pony up more.

With 23 races on the schedule this season F1 may be at the point where it can’t add new races without removing existing ones. With China likely to return to the schedule in 2023 or ’24 and Las Vegas eager to get in on the action look for several European venues to pay considerably more than in the past in order to keep their races.

Legendary star says which one was 'wonderful',"Michael Jackson performs ‘Ben’ at the 1973 Oscars

One woman stood by Michael Jackson's side on stage for ten years. You may not know the name but if you have ever seen any of MJ's concerts live or on recordings then you will have seen the statuesque bleached-blonde Amazon in a series of towering headdresses wielding a guitar on those famous riffs from Beat It and Black or White. Jennifer Batten played on all three world tours – Bad (1987–1989) Dangerous (1992) and HIStory (1996–1997) – as well as the 1993 Super Bowl half-time show. In a new interview she opened up about her incredible years with MJ and how being a child star had shaped him.

It's an extraordinary peek into the almost unreal experience of travelling the world with the most famous man on the planet in extravagant times when each week cost half a million dollars just for travelling and transportation costs. Batten described being part of the entourage as like ""moving a small city."" Jackson's entourage included over 100 people and the whole tour would often take over three hotels in each city they visited. But before each show the star would gather all the performers together for a 'group prayer' before they went on. MJ would also ask that each day's rehearsals and shows be recorded so he could review footage at night after each set-up day or concert when everyone else went off to party or rest and pass on notes the next morning. Like every great artist he was a perfectionist but Batten passionately describes what set him apart and used one terrifying moment to explain why.

Speaking to the Appetite for Distortion channel she was asked what she thought more people should know about the real Michael Jackson the man behind the mask. Scroll down to watch the full interview. She said: ""He was extremely respectful. A lot of times you hear stories about huge acts that are just a-holes to their band you know (who say) 'You guys sleep on the bus and I get the five-star hotel.' Or there are certain people that are notorious... They're yelling at people on stage. Or even Prince. When somebody made a mistake he'd pull the James Brown thing. He would find you. You know (saying the) 'You made a mistake on this song so you owe me $500' kind of thing. ""And Michael wasn't like that at all. That was not his upbringing. He was always very respectful to everyone and appreciated us. So it was really wonderful."" DON'T MISS

Fans worldwide are celebrating Johnny Cash's 90th birthday this weekend. His relationship with June remains as iconic as his music and they were both utterly in love with each other. However their only child John Carter Cash recalled how his mother would get a ""mischievous twinkle"" when she spoke of her early days with Elvis. The King and Johnny were friends with huge mutual personal and professional respect for each other but June told her son she sometimes wondered what would have happened if she had married The King. After all they built their music careers side by side in tour buses and local clubs and Elvis would often sleep over at her house in between.

Elvis and June were contemporaries on the Memphis and Southern US music scenes in the mid-1950s and often toured together. Meanwhile The King and Johnny were both signed to Sun Records and June recalled how the young aspiring star would often talk about Johnny and croon his songs innocently promising to introduce her to the man who would become her husband one day – although nobody knew it at the time. Nor could anyone imagine the twelve years of heartache it would take before they were finally married. June Carter had been performing from a young age on the country music circuit with her sisters and mother Maybelle. Elvis also started his career touring the theatres fairs and radio stations of the southern states with his bandmates Scotty Moore and Bill Black.

June later described how it was Elvis who introduced her to Johnny's music on their first tour together. She wrote: ""He was stooped down on one knee and grasping a guitar trying to tune it to somewhere near the correct pitch to make a correct chord ring. (He would sing) 'Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down Ah-ummm Ah-ummm' and he'd strike the guitar again. Plink plunk: 'Ah-ummm ...' ""'What are you trying to do?' I asked. 'I'm trying to tune this guitar honey and I'm trying to sing like Johnny Cash.'"" DON'T MISS

June Carter in 1956

June and Johnny finally met backstage at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville in June 1956. He was about to go onstage to debut what would become one of his most iconic hits I Walk The Line. June said: ""I found myself backstage trying to tune my guitar humming 'Ah-ummm Ah-Ummm' when all of a sudden there he was! The voice was the same. Johnny Cash took me by the hand and said 'I've always wanted to meet you'. ""The strangest feeling came over me. I was afraid to look him in the eyes. It was one of the things I did best. I never stammered and still found myself not able to say much of anything. I think I finally blurted out - 'I feel like I know you already. Elvis plays you on the jukebox all the time and he can't tune his guitar without humming Cry Cry Cry. Now he's got me doing it.'""

He was of course notoriously linked with women he worked with throughout his career as well as fans in every city he visited. In 2008 June's son John Carter Cash released the biography Anchored In Love: An Intimate Portrait of June Carter Cash with his own insight into the stars' relationship. He wrote: ""Throughout my life I would see Mom get a mischievous twinkle in her eye whenever she mentioned Elvis Presley. Her eyes would flash merrily and she would say 'You know son your father was always jealous of Elvis.'

""She even told me once that she sometimes wondered what would have happened if she had fallen in love with Elvis.



""Mom and Elvis occasionally toured together along with other performers sometimes including Mother Maybelle and one or more of June's sisters. The Carter's were friends of Elvis and there are stories about Mother Maybelle sewing buttons on Elvis' shirts when they popped off during his wild onstage gyrations. ""Though Mom always maintained that she never had an affair with Elvis Carl (her first husband) believed differently and perhaps for good reason. After Carl moved out of their Madison home Mom would sometimes let Elvis stay at the house to 'rest' after a tour.""

Although the two companies announced the agreement tonight Lockheed and Microsoft have already collaborated on their first demonstration which took place at Lockheed Martin Space’s 5G test range in Colorado last December.

“We essentially simulated four different air platforms doing ISR missions and close air support to support a simulated special operations force on the ground that was pursuing a high value target” said Dan Rice Lockheed’s vice president for 5G.MIL the term Lockheed uses to describe its 5G efforts.

During the laboratory tests the companies were able to link three hybrid base stations — basically transportable 5G base stations that can also connect to military networks — to Microsoft’s 5G core and to military datalinks such as NATO’s Link 16 and other advanced tactical links.

RELATED: Lockheed developing prototype 5G testbed for Marines

The companies also used Microsoft’s Azure Arc a suite of management tools for cloud environments to move applications from the enterprise level to the tactical level to be used by dismounted troops on the ground Rice said

“The real intent here was to start to expand and show the value of these hybrid connected networks to bridge the gaps that we see today in DoD communication” he said.

Lockheed CEO Jim Taiclet has personally made 5G integration one of the company’s top priorities since taking its reins in 2020.

During a Feb. 10 investors conference Taiclet said 5G.MIL could “[put] Lockheed Martin … in the pole position” for joint all domain operations — the US military concept that calls for linking all of the services’ sensors and shooters together so that they can exchange data across currently stovepiped systems.

Lockheed’s vision for 5G.MIL involves taking commercial 5G technologies figuring out how to integrate them with existing military networks and layering on protections to make them more resilient and secure Rice said.

“Existing and emerging DoD communication systems are going to be around for a long time to come and we can augment and support those existing systems with the capabilities of 5G and next-gen technology” Rice said. “We don’t view this as ending with 5G but starting to integrate the commercial telecommunication capabilities where commercial industry has invested hundreds of billions of dollars to create resilient high performance mobile telecommunications.”

Aside from Microsoft Lockheed has also signed partnership deals with a number of commercial communications companies including a November 2021 agreement with Verizon and a March 2021 partnership with satellite startup Omnispace.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvY2toZWVkbWFydGluLmNvbS9lbi1zYS9uZXdzL2xvY2toZWVkLW1hcnRpbi10by1zaG93Y2FzZS1jYXBhYmlsaXRpZXMtYXQtd2RzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lockheed Martin to showcase capabilities at WDS,"RIYADH Saudi Arabia Feb. 27 2022 – Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) the U.S.-based global technology leader will present its vision for 21st century security capabilities at the inaugural World Defense Show (WDS) in Riyadh.

WDS which will run from March 6 to 9 2022 is a fully integrated and future-focused defense event that is set to showcase cutting-edge developments from around the world. Lockheed Martin as a platinum sponsor of the event will showcase network-centric systems designed to counter evolving security threats across all domains land air sea and space. The company will demonstrate how Multi-Domain Operations or Joint All-Domain Operations (MDO/JADO) can synchronize major systems such as missile defense satellites aircraft ships and ground vehicles to improve situational awareness and accelerate decision-making in the field particularly related to counter-drone and anti-missile measures.

“Our involvement in and support for the World Defense Show underlines Lockheed Martin’s longstanding partnership with Saudi Arabia. We look forward to showcasing how we are driving interoperability for our partners by merging physical technology with digital technologies to increase our defensive and deterrent capabilities” said Joseph Rank Lockheed Martin’s chief executive for Saudi Arabia and Africa. “Lockheed Martin is one of the most trusted and involved defense partners in the region and the World Defense Show will be an excellent platform for us to engage with our stakeholders in Saudi Arabia and around the world.”

In addition to showcasing the world's most advanced defense platforms several senior executives from Lockheed Martin will deliver keynote addresses and participate in panel sessions at WDS. Topics to be addressed range from Saudi Vision 2030 to advancing gender equality in defense developing young engineers and creating technological advantages for the Kingdom through localization.

She was the beloved wife of Gene H. Porter.

She was born Nancy Lee Webster in Nashua in January 1942 the oldest of nine children of the late Victor Webster and Elizabeth (Leach) Webster. She thrived in the Nashua Public School System and kept in touch with many of her classmates throughout her life. Always a diligent and dedicated worker Nancy enjoyed a successful 45-year career at Sanders Associates/Lockheed Martin/BAE Systems retiring in 2010 as the Executive Secretary to the Company President. She subsequently served for eight happy years as a joyful teachers’ aide in Pre-K classrooms at St. Christopher Academy in Nashua where she was well-loved by the children and staff alike.

Nancy often spoke of her great fortune in having two wonderful marriages with loving and supportive husbands. In 1961 Nancy married Gordon Garceau and they lived happily together raising their two children until Gordon’s tragic passing in 1988. Thereafter Nancy found love again marrying Gene Porter in 1993 with whom she enjoyed nearly 30 joyful years until her passing.

Nancy had a remarkable ability to quickly recognize old acquaintances after decades of separation and remained an adept taker of shorthand notes even at age 80. Nancy was a meticulous custodian of her historic home in Nashua’s North End and enjoyed her beach home in Maine gardening travel time with loved ones and combing through what seemed like every craft fair in New England.

Nancy is survived by her devoted husband Gene Porter her two children and their spouses Lynn and Fred vonOldenburg of Austin Texas and Derek and Mary Garceau of Cleveland Heights Ohio; her six grandchildren: Brittany Hannah Olivia and Sarah vonOldenburg and William and Andrew Garceau; her eight siblings and their families and her many close friends.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 166.15 points or about 0.49% but closed well off session lows at 33892.60. The S&P 500 closed down 0.24% at 4373.94 while the Nasdaq rallied late in the session for a gain of 0.41% to 13751.40.

Monday's moves capped off a rough February for stocks with the major averages all posting sharp monthly losses.

The volatile session came amid turmoil over the conflict between Russia and Ukraine where Ukrainian forces have held key cities including the capital of Kyiv. Officials from both countries held a round of negotiations near the Belarus border on Monday.

""War is fundamentally a 'risk off' environment for risky assets as global investors move into sovereign bonds and other 'safe havens' until some kind of conclusion/new normal becomes priced in. ... Everything about this is unprecedented so about the only rational thing to say about equities is to expect volatility to continue pending a resolution"" Raymond James strategist Tavis McCourt said in a note.

Defense stocks like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman rose 6.7% and 7.9% respectively. Cybersecurity stocks also outperformed with Crowdstrike jumping 7.4% helping limit losses for the Nasdaq.

Bank stocks were under pressure with JPMorgan falling 4.2% and Citigroup dropping 4.4%.

Government bond yields were sharply lower across the curve with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note most recently at 1.83% off 15 basis points on the session. A basis point is 0.01%; yields move opposite prices and were lower amid high demand for safe-haven bonds.

The lower bond yields may have helped the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite outperform as growth-oriented stocks tend to perform better when rates are low. Shares of Tesla rose 7.5% on Monday.

Currency markets were a major area of volatility on Monday. The Central Bank of Russia more than doubled its key interest rate to 20% from 9.5% in reaction to a currency move that saw the ruble tumble nearly 22% against the U.S. dollar. The ruble hit a record low against the dollar early Monday.

Over the weekend the U.S. joined allies in Europe and Canada in moving to bar key Russian banks from the interbank messaging system SWIFT. The system connects more than 11000 banks and financial institutions in more than 200 countries and territories.

Additionally the U.S. and European allies have also taken action against Russia's central bank effectively freezing the country's foreign reserves.

The sanctions in financial markets had some investors and traders looking for potential disruptions outside of Russian markets.

""Some Russian banks being removed from SWIFT (energy transactions exempt) and the freezing of the Russian central bank's access to its foreign currency reserves held in the West clearly increases economic tail risk"" said Dennis DeBusschere of 22V Research.

However DeBusschere pointed out that Russia can still sell oil and said there could be ""loop holes"" in Russia's frozen assets which ""might limit the disaster in markets for a few days.""

Meanwhile Russian military vehicles entered Ukraine's second-largest city Kharkiv with reports of fighting taking place and residents being warned to stay in shelters. Russian President Vladimir Putin put his country's nuclear deterrence forces on high alert Sunday amid a growing global backlash against the invasion.

Monday marks the final day of trading for February and even with a strong rally at the end of last week the three major U.S. averages all fell more than 3% for the month. The Dow was the worst performer falling 3.5% for its worst month since November.

Stocks particularly the tech-heavy Nasdaq were already in a downturn before the invasion of Ukraine.

The conflict comes ""on top of our base case which is that we were already potentially headed for a bear market due to valuations rising rates and inflation and the lack of a Fed put"" said Phillip Toews CEO of Toews Asset Management.

""Now is not a great outlook for the markets despite some short-term rallies like we saw last week"" Toews added."

Inter Miami will start their 2022 season today when they host the Chicago Fire at 6 p.m. at the DRV PNK Stadium. Lowe 28 initially started his career in the United States when he was drafted by the Seattle Sounders in 2014. However during his two years in the league he did not make an appearance and was sent on loan during that period. He would leave for United Soccer League Championship team Tampa Bay Rowdies in 2017 the country’s second-tier before moving to Europe that same year.

Lowe signed with Inter Miami in January and has already started to make an impression on the team and the coaching staff. After their pre-season game against Columbus Crew on February 12 where they drew 1-1 assistant coach Jason Kreis praised Lowe’s leadership and hopes he can play a key part in the club’s bid to make the MLS play-offs for the second time in the franchise’s history.

“I think he was fantastic. I’m really impressed with what he has brought to our team on the field but also what he has brought to the team from an off-the-field sort of perspective with his leadership and his communication” Kreis said.

As part of a squad that is mixed with experience and youth Lowe says that he has been impressed with the team’s willingness to improve daily and believes that the foundation is there to have a good season.

“They are young vibrant full of energy with a good mixture of experience and youth. That goes a long way when you have that mixture. I can see the guys willing to learn. The willingness to learn is important when you are on a team. The guys want to work hard” Lowe said. “If everyone can do that collectively I think this season should be fun.”

Inter Miami made the play-offs in their MLS debut in 2020 but failed to qualify last season finishing 11th in the Eastern Conference. Lowe says he feels that he can fit into the playing system of head coach Phil Neville and is looking to continue his evolution as a player now having the chance to play in the league where his professional career started.

“I’m a versatile player. I can adapt to my team and whatever the coach asks of me I try to do it to the best of my ability and that’s what I have to continue to do to improve as a player” Lowe said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxvb3Blci5jb20vNzgxNTU1L3doeS1qZWZmLWxvd2UtZnJvbS1qb2UtdnMtY2Fyb2xlLWxvb2tzLXNvLWZhbWlsaWFyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Jeff Lowe From Joe Vs. Carole Looks So Familiar,"Dean Winters' first major network TV role came in the Dick Wolf procedural ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" which is a spinoff of the original ""Law & Order."" Winters first appeared in the series premiere of the show in 1999 as Detective Brian Cassidy. As the youngest member of the precinct Detective Cassidy is paired with veteran Detective John Munch (Richard Belzer). His earnestness about the job comes through occasionally raising eyebrows.

Winters however was also a regular in the HBO series ""Oz"" at the same time as his initial run in ""Law & Order: SVU"" and while the shooting schedule for ""Oz"" gave him enough time to do both shows per Winters contract disputes prevented him from remaining with the series making Episode 13 of Season 1 his last appearance on the show — or not.

This thankfully didn't turn out to be the end of Winters' time in ""Law & Order: SVU"" as upon learning that he'd never been called back even after the end of ""Oz"" the cast of ""Law & Order: SVU"" rallied to get him back on the show (via The A.V. Club). Winters returned in Season 13 in 2012 with the show establishing that Cassidy has been undercover.

Cassidy and Detective Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) also have a one-night stand during the show's first season and they end up re-kindling their potential relationship when Cassidy returns. Winters ultimately left the show again in Season 15 before returning in Season 19 this time as a district attorney investigator. To date Winters has appeared in a total of 31 episodes across two decades of the show."

Officers booked Jonaven Perkins-Sinapati Saturday afternoon for allegedly firing a gun out of a moving vehicle in Kaneohe.

Officials say no one was hurt.

Police say Perkins-Sinapati is the same man who was driving a sedan being chased by HPD in Makaha in 2021.

That pursuit led to a crash leaving the 38-year-old in a coma for weeks.

A civil lawsuit from Sinapati blamed HPD for the wreck that also injured five others.

In February - Honolulu’s city council approved the settlement.

The criminal trial for the four HPD officers accused in the case is scheduled to start in June.

All have pleaded not guilty and are on restricted duty.

Perkins Sinapati has not yet been charged for the latest gun offenses.

After missing the past two-plus seasons with a knee injury Chicago Bulls guard Lonzo Ball has exercised the $21.4 million option on his contract for the 2024-25 season sources told ESPN on Saturday.

Ball has undergone three surgeries on his left knee the most recent a cartilage transplant in 2023. There remains some guarded hope that he could return next season but there are no assurances that the damaged knee will allow for him to play again.

Ball 26 signed an original four-year $80 million deal as part of a sign-and-trade with New Orleans in the summer of 2021. After a fantastic start that had the Bulls leading the Eastern Conference in 2021-22 Ball averaged 13.0 points 5.4 rebounds 5.1 assists and 1.8 steals before a knee injury 35 games into the season.

His inactivity has caused his contract to become a blight on the Bulls' salary cap.

For one night only this weekend it also had Madonna.

More than a million people thronged Copacabana beach on Saturday night turning its vast stretch of sand into a massive dancefloor for a free concert by the pop star as she completed her world tour.

“Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world” Madonna 65 told the tightly packed crowd. Pointing out the ocean view and the mountains she added: “This place is magic.”

In the run-up to the concert the city had been buzzing with fans lined up outside the stately Copacabana Palace hotel in the hope of catching a glimpse of the star. The city’s airport fielded an estimated 170 extra flights as fans poured in from around the world.

City officials estimated that 1.6 million people turned up for the concert some watching from brightly lit apartments or hotels overlooking the beach while others looked on from motorboats and sailboats anchored nearby.

As drones and helicopters flew overhead the singer offered up a dazzling show playing classics ranging from Like a Virgin to Like a Prayer and cycling through dozens of sets and costume changes.

Flanked by giant screens she began the show with her 1998 hit Nothing Really Matters eliciting a huge cheer from the crowd.

“Oi Rio!” she called out in Portuguese. The response was swift carried by more than a million voices: “Oi Queen Madonna!”

The singer also paid an emotional tribute to “all the bright lights” lost to Aids as she sang Live to Tell against a backdrop of black-and-white photos featuring people who died from the illness.

The Brazilian pop artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar as well as younger musicians from samba schools also took part in the show.

The show which Madonna’s official website described as the biggest ever in her 40-year career marked the final stop on her Celebration tour. Giant screens and 18 sound towers had been spread out along the beach to ensure the crowds could enjoy the event.

Fans many of whom lined up hours or even days before the concert to get a good view hailed Madonna’s performance. “I have never seen such a powerful show” one told the BBC. “It’s unimaginable very much out of the ordinary” she added.

“Madonna is spectacular” said another. “There’s no concert better than Madonna’s.”

City officials on high alert after a young Brazilian fan died at a Taylor Swift concert last year as a result of heat exhaustion ordered firefighters to cool down fans by spraying water before the concert. Free drinking water was also handed out as temperatures hovered at about 27C (81F) during the late-night show.

More than 3000 police officers were deployed around the concert area where the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart have also drawn million-strong crowds.

Across Rio anticipation had been building all week. “Welcome Queen!” read Heineken ads plastered around the city while bars and restaurants served up “Like a Virgin” cocktails. Across the Copacabana neighbourhood the singer’s image was emblazoned on billboards souvenirs and T-shirts.

As hotel bookings in Copacabana climbed to an estimated 98% of capacity Rio state’s security readied plans that included the presence of 3200 military personnel and 1500 civilian police officers on standby while the country’s navy carried out inspections of any vessel looking to follow the concert offshore. City officials estimated that the concert would inject as much as 293m reais (£46m) into the local economy.

Entering Jaffa’s impressive renovated well-maintained building that once housed the School of the Sisterhood of Saint Joseph convent and adjacent 19th-century former French hospital you will be impressed.

An extensive seven-year restoration preservation and renovation created an impressive boutique accommodation – The Jaffa luxury hotel. A partly hidden sign indicates that the hotel is part of a luxury collection. To the puzzled traveler it might be an enigma but for the experienced one it is an indication of the best there is. Yet no sign board or any clue makes the guest aware that the hotel is part of the mighty Marriott hotel brand.

The term “collection” as far as hotels are concerned is creating a global buzz and The Jaffa may be the harbinger that indicates that a rise in international collections is coming.

What are these collection hotels? In most cases these are a collection of independent hotels that join a major brand’s platform while retaining their own names and branding. THE ISROTEL Dead Sea Hotel (credit: ISROTEL)

This trend is called soft-branding or umbrella-branding established by recognized hotel chains to meet the increasing demand of hotel experiences. In recent years the hospitality industry is fostering individuality. They appeal to hotel owners that do not wish to be held to strict standards of a classic brand.

However they eat the cake and have it at the same time. They operate their hotels themselves under a recognized brand. This joint venture is a win-win that allows for the proliferation of soft brands.

At the same time it energizes the individual existing hotel and owners enjoy the strong distribution of a reputed brand network. The bonus is the exposure to millions of loyalty club members who love to receive perks like complimentary breakfast room upgrades and hotel credits.

For the global brands it is like opening a box of candies – a potential for huge growth as they are interested in signing as many hotels as they can to their commercial systems. In no time they assure immediate positive cash flows with no risk at all.

Marriott’s Luxury Collection is defined as “comprised of world-renowned hotels and resorts offering unique authentic experiences that evoke lasting treasured memories.”

“The Jaffa is a unique historic luxury property that Marriott is proud to have in its portfolio and to expose to more than 140 million members of its Bonvoy loyalty program” says General Manager Michael Schmid. “Our standards are similar to our luxury Ritz Carlton brand but we try to be less formal in keeping our individuality.”

Isrotel one of Israel’s dominant hotel chains announced last December a new branding which classifies its hotels into three segments. “Isrotel Collection – the vacation and resort hotels suitable for families. Exclusive – the chain’s luxury hotels and Design – hotels of up to 200 rooms emphasizing design experience” says Nahum Kara Isrotel’s head of sales and marketing.

However those hotels will clearly carry the company name publicly. What is interesting is its Design’s Publica hotel in Herzliya introducing a mysterious sign at the entrance – Autograph Collection.

This collection is a group of independent upscale-to-luxury hotels within the Marriott International portfolio. This brand’s properties are independently owned and operated under the Autograph Collection name.

“The Ella brothers the Publica co-owners successfully initiated that cooperation with Marriott when the hotel was launched” explains Kara.

The Autograph experience itself caters to unique preferences such as culinary historical exploration arts family sports and urban tours – surely aiming for the Millennials which dominate Herzliya Pituah workplaces.

How significant is the collection buzz? It’s the future of the industry as apparently this is what Millennials will demand. Israeli tourism expert Joseph Fischer with 40 years of experience working for leading international hospitality brands is confident.

“If there’s something that the corona pandemic should teach the lodging sector it is that constant change is here to stay. All those big old ‘cookie-cutter’ brands lost their attractiveness in the new world led by Millennials. Nowadays it’s all about creating experiences and memories and not about hard standards – room sizes and executive lounges. The collection is a good solution for big brands that want to stay attractive” he says.

Indications here are starting to pop up. Only recently Hilton announced plans to introduce for the first time two of its collection hotels in Israel. The LXR and Curio properties on Tel Aviv’s waterfront next to Independence Park. They are scheduled to open in 2026.

Will other international or Israeli brands follow with their own collection portfolio?

Stay tuned. For us the customers this is great news. We are exposed to endless new hospitality opportunities and surprises with competitive prices and pampering rewards for memorable experiences while the collection variant is buzzing.

View the current offers here.

The UBS Visa Infinite Credit Card provides many benefits including popular perks such as unlimited Priority Pass lounge guests and price protection that most other cards have discontinued. However earning rates are modest and some cardholders may struggle to maximize redemptions. Card Rating*: ⭐⭐⭐

*Card Rating is based on the opinion of TPG's editors and is not influenced by the card issuer.

The information for the UBS Visa Infinite Card has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.

Before researching the card to write this review I hadn't seen or heard much about the UBS Visa Infinite Credit Card. I expected that the card wouldn't have much going for it but I was wrong. Aspects such as price protection and a Priority Pass membership with unlimited guest privileges make it stand out from the crowd.

This card certainly isn't a good fit for everyone though.

Let's take a closer look at the UBS Visa Infinite Credit Card so you can determine whether it is a good addition to your wallet.

Who is this card for?

(Photo by Isabelle Raphael/The Points Guy)

The UBS Visa Infinite charges a $495 annual fee. But the card can be a good option for travelers who can get value from high-end service-oriented benefits. After all the UBS concierge can be a great resource. And when you book through the UBS concierge you can get elite-like perks at select hotel brands. The card also offers some of the most comprehensive travel and shopping benefits that you'll find on a currently-available travel rewards card.

However the UBS Visa Infinite's earning rates aren't particularly compelling and the redemption process may be difficult to maximize. So you'll likely want to pass on this card if you won't get significant value from its perks if you're looking for a card with lucrative earning rates or want a card that earns transferable points.

Welcome bonus

(Photo by The Points Guy)

The UBS Visa Infinite Credit Card currently offers a welcome bonus of 25000 points when you make $3000 in eligible purchases during the first three months from card account approval. You must call UBS or contact your UBS Financial Advisor to apply for the card. Elevated welcome bonuses are sometimes available to UBS clients when they speak with their UBS financial adviser.

There are many ways to redeem your points as we'll discuss below. Although you could redeem these 25000 points for a $250 statement credit or one flight costing up to $350 you'll get the most value when you redeem 50000 points for one flight costing up to $900. You can expect to redeem your rewards for between 1 cent and 1.8 cents per point making the welcome bonus worth between $250 and $450.

If you're looking for a premium travel rewards card that's currently offering a higher welcome bonus consider applying for a card like The Platinum Card® from American Express Chase Sapphire Reserve or Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card.

Main benefits and perks

UBS loaded its UBS Visa Infinite card with benefits and perks including some benefits that most other issuers have slashed from their cards. For example the UBS Visa Infinite still offers unlimited complimentary access to Priority Pass Select lounges for cardholders and an unlimited number of guests after you enroll.

Plus the UBS Visa Infinite offers excellent shopping protections — including increasingly rare price protection and almost unheard of event ticket protection — when you make purchases with your card:

Purchase security of up to $10000 per claim and $50000 per year.

Price protection of up to $500 per claim and $1500 per year.

Return protection of up to $300 per claim and $1000 per year.

Extended warranty service extends warranties of three years or less by up to one year (for up to $10000 per claim and $50000 per year).

Event ticket protection of up to $500 per event ticket $2000 per event and $5000 per year.

The card comes with a $250 airline fee credit which works similarly to the airline fee credit offered by select Amex cards. The UBS Visa Infinite's airline fee credit is for ancillary airline fees on one qualifying U.S. domestic airline that you've selected. Examples of eligible airline fees include ""preferred seating upgrades ticket change/cancellation fees checked baggage fees in-flight entertainment onboard food and beverage charges airport lounge fees and other airline travel fees."" Enrollment is required for select benefits.

Cardholders also get access to various travel benefits and perks including:

Finally cardholders also get access to these other perks:

UBS Concierge to assist with coordinating travel planning dining entertainment event ticket access and more.

No additional fee for up to 24 authorized users.

Use your card at any ATM and pay no cash advance or finance charges (if funds are available in a linked UBS resource management account) plus get unlimited ATM fee rebates on cash withdrawals in the U.S. (up to $10 per transaction).

Access to the UBS Dining program.

No foreign transaction fees.

How to earn points

The UBS Visa Infinite earns 3 points per dollar spent on commercial air travel 2 points per dollar spent on gas and groceries and 1 point per dollar spent on all other eligible purchases. Since points are generally redeemable for 1 to 1.8 cents each you'll get an effective return of 3 to 5.4% on commercial air travel 2 to 3.6% on gas and groceries and 1 to 1.8% on all other purchases.

There's no cap to the points you can earn. And points don't expire as long as your card is open.

How to redeem points

Maximize your redemption by finding an airfare costing just under $900. (Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

There are many options for redeeming your points. However you'll get the most value when you redeem 50000 points for one flight costing up to $900 through UBS. You can redeem online through UBS Online Services or over the phone with the UBS Rewards Desk but you'll want to redeem for a flight costing as close to $900 as possible without going over.

Although you can redeem for a ticket costing more than $900 you must pay the price difference using additional points at a rate of 5000 points per $50. You can only make additional payments with points and you must do so in increments of 5000 points. But redeeming for a ticket well under $900 leaves potential value on the table.

Assuming you can find a flight bookable through UBS for just under $900 this means you can get up to 1.8 cents per point. Alternatively you could redeem 25000 points through the UBS Rewards Service Center for one flight costing up to $350 — but this would only give you up to 1.4 cents per point.

If you have trouble finding a flight just under $900 or just under $350 there are other redemption options. For example you can pay with points for travel gift cards and merchandise. But these other options generally provide no more than one cent of value per point.

How does the UBS Visa Infinite compare?

If you're considering the UBS Visa Infinite you're likely comparing it against other premium travel cards such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve and The Platinum Card® from American Express. Here's a table comparing these cards.

Granted the UBS Visa Infinite and Chase Sapphire Reserve are Visa Infinite cards. But Visa Infinite perks tend to vary across cards. Each of these cards will be the best fit for some cardholders so you'll need to determine which card is best for you.

Bottom line

Despite lackluster earning rates the UBS Visa Infinite Credit Card provides valuable benefits that may justify its $495 annual fee. From comprehensive travel protections and premium travel benefits to price protection many of the card's benefits can effectively offset the card's annual fee for certain cardholders.

You're most likely to get significant value from the card if you use the premium travel perks such as private aviation benefits elite-like amenities at select hotel brands and a knowledgeable concierge.

Taking a hard look at how much you'd use the card's benefits should tell you whether it's worthwhile to add the UBS Visa Infinite Credit Card to your wallet.

Last year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a damning report noting that unless there are “immediate rapid and large-scale reductions” [1] in emissions the targets set by the 2015 Paris Agreement will be out of reach.

It’s not just a problem for the future we’re already feeling the effects and costs of a changing climate. 2021 ranked as the fourth-warmest year on record in the US which experienced 20 weather- and climate-related disasters such as wildfires and hurricanes that cost $1bn or more—totalling a staggering US$145bn. [2]

It’s no surprise then that climate-change related risks are among the top concerns of business leaders both now and in the long term. [3]

To prepare companies should invest in climate resilience—their capacity to adapt and succeed in the face of the impacts of climate change as well as maximise the strategic opportunities emerging from the shift to a low-carbon economy. [4]

All sectors many risks

There are a number of risks associated with a changing climate and nearly every industry and sector is threatened by the direct or indirect impacts of climate change. [5]

Physical risks include the direct risks to existing facilities supply chains transport infrastructure energy and water supplies as well as employees customers and the communities in which they live from more frequent extreme and unpredictable weather events. Failure to act also raises liability risks and potential litigation. [6]",,,,,,,,,,,,

Mastercard awarded Commercial Bank the two trophies for being the 1st in Middle East and Africa and 3rd in the World in Mastercard World Elite Awards for the year 2021 at a ceremony held at the Commercial Bank Plaza.

The awarding ceremony was attended by Amit Sah executive general manager and head (Retail Banking) and Roya Khajeh assistant general manager and head (Cards and Payments). Mastercard was represented by Gaurang Shah head (Product MEA); Nadia Ghissassi Qatar Kuwait Iraq and Oman Cluster head and Omar Ahmad manager Account Management.

“The Mastercard World Elite awards are a testament that our exclusive offerings appeal to our Limited-Edition customers and indubitably enhance their banking experience thanks to its state-of-the-art look and feel and worldwide luxurious privileges”.

Khajeh stated “Commercial Bank takes pride in its best-in-class cards particularly in the Limited-Edition Black Card Programme that has been recognised as the region’s Best in-class Programme for high net-worth individuals with a loyalty programme on par with the best in the world.

“The Limited-Edition Black card is a status symbol with bespoke benefits and exceptional privileges desired by many but accessible to a few”.

Look I get it: when compared with some of Canada’s finest rewards and cash-back credit cards the Canadian Tire Triangle Mastercard leaves one wanting more. The base rate is about as low as you can get (0.8% on non-Canadian Tire purchases). And though this rewards card earns 4% back on Canadian Tire purchases you earn 4% back pre-tax meaning you’ll never earn rewards on HST.

But hear me out. The Canadian Tire Mastercard is still one of Canada’s finest retail cards. Putting aside our differences here are five reasons we should all stop hating on this Canadian favourite.

1. No annual fee

First off the Canadian Tire Mastercard charges no annual fee. I mean come on: for a card that earns 4% CT money (plus 1.5% on groceries and five cents per litre on gas) you can’t really complain. While true other no-fee credit cards have higher earn rates for frequent Canadian Tire shoppers perhaps no card will earn you more rewards than this one.

2. 24/7 medical assistance

The Canadian Tire Triangle Mastercard has a slew of “concierge services” built into it which can help you make arrangements for shopping travel entertainment and even business. While these services can come in handy there’s one that’s frequently overlooked: medical assistance.

Through your card’s concierge you can you make appointments plan prescription refills and book visitations through certain medical providers. You can also call to make arrangements for emergency medical transportation which can come in handy if you’re traveling abroad and you don’t know the country’s emergency number.

Again this is a free service for Canadian Tire Triangle Mastercard holders. That’s not bad for a card that doesn’t charge an annual fee.

3. Bonus days and stacking

Canadian Tire will often schedule “bonus days” during which you can earn a significant amount of CT money.

For instance this month Canadian Tire will have three bonus days. The first is March 7. You can earn 40 times back when you use your Mastercard in-store or online. The next bonus days are a a pair: March 16 and March 17. On these days you’ll earn 30 times the Canadian Tire money when you buy select items online only.

Bonus days could be a great opportunity to practice another benefit of the CT rewards program: stacking. Unlike other retail stores Canadian Tire will let you use multiple offers on a single purchase which can help you earn some serious CT money. If you stack offers and use your Canadian Tire Mastercard you’ll also earn 4% back.

4. Roadside-assistance gold plan

Canadian Tire’s roadside-assistance gold plan is a must-have for Canadians who travel long distances or commute frequently. Under this plan you’ll get five free service calls per year one towing service to a destination of your choice unlimited tows to Canadian Tire Auto Service Centres across the country a battery boost fuel delivery and free extrication and winching services.

Without a Canadian Tire Triangle Mastercard you’d be stuck paying $99.99 per year for the gold plan. With the card however you pay nothing. You just have to activate your membership online and you’ll enjoy free roadside assistance.

5. No-receipt returns at Canadian Tire stores

Normally Canadian Tire won’t accept returns without a receipt. But if you made the purchase with your Canadian Tire Triangle Mastercard you have nothing to worry about. Canadian Tire will look up your purchase on your card. That means no more digging through the trash to find that scrunched-up receipt paper.

Should you get the Canadian Tire Mastercard?

The Canadian Tire Triangle Mastercard is ideal for Canadians who shop frequently at Canadian Tire and buy gas at Husky or Gas+ stations. Because your earnings will come to you in the form of Canadian Tire Money you’ll benefit the most from this card if you buy most of your products there.

If you don’t shop at Canadian Tire don’t sweat it: take a look at some of Canada’s best rewards cards or cash-back cards. Choose a card that will reward you more points or cash back for your spending and you could amass some serious rewards.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ndWxmLXRpbWVzLmNvbS9zdG9yeS83MTA3MTkvbWFzdGVyY2FyZC1yZWNvZ25pc2VzLWNvbW1lcmNpYWwtYmFua3Mtb3V0c3RhbmRpbmctcGVyZm9ybWFuY2UtZm9yLWl0cy11bHRyYS1oaWdoLW5ldC13b3J0aC1jdXN0b21lcnPSAZEBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ3VsZi10aW1lcy5jb20vc3RvcnkvNzEwNzE5L21hc3RlcmNhcmQtcmVjb2duaXNlcy1jb21tZXJjaWFsLWJhbmtzLW91dHN0YW5kaW5nLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLWZvci1pdHMtdWx0cmEtaGlnaC1uZXQtd29ydGgtY3VzdG9tZXJzL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mastercard recognises Commercial Bank’s outstanding performance for its ultra high net worth customers| Gulf Times,Commercial Bank has been awarded by Mastercard in recognition of the Bank’s outstanding performance of its Limited-Edition Black World Elite Credit Card the best-in-class program in the region designed to address the needs of its ultra-high net worth customers.Mastercard awarded Commercial Bank the two trophies for being the 1st in Middle East and Africa and 3rd in the World in MasterCard World Elite Awards for the year 2021 at a ceremony held at the Commercial Bank Plaza.

Full Explainer,"For the first time since its inception in 2008 the Indian Premier League's (IPL) league phase will see the teams divided into two virtual groups. The IPL Governing Council on Friday announced that IPL 2022 will begin from March 26 with the final slated on May 29. The 70 matches in the league phase will be hosted across four venues in Mumbai and Pune. Over the years IPL's league stage has always been played in a home-away format where each team plays the same opposition twice but in the 15th edition there will be a change. The number of teams in IPL 2022 has been increased to 10 with the addition of two new franchises - Gujarat Titans and Lucknow Super Giants - but the number of matches per team remains 14.

The 10 teams will play a total of 14 league matches (7 home matches and 7 away matches) totalling to 70 league matches followed by the 4 playoff matches. Each team will play 5 teams twice and the remaining 4 teams only once (2 only home and 2 only away).

To decide on the above teams have been assigned in two virtual groups based on the number of IPL Championships won followed by the number of Final matches played by the respective teams.

Group A comprises Mumbai Indians KKR Rajasthan Royals Delhi Capitals and Lucknow Super Giants.

IPL 2022 Virtual Groups Explained

The group B will have Chennai Super Kings Sunrisers Hyderabad Royal Challengers Bengaluru Punjab Kings and Gujarat Titans.

In group A MI (Team 1) with five titles has been placed as first team. Correspondingly in group B the first team is CSK (Team 2) which has four titles.

Team 3 is again placed in group A and that is KKR with two titles and the corresponding Team 4 placed in group B is SRH with a sole title.

Team 5 again in group A is Rajasthan Royals (1 title) and its corresponding Team 6 in group B is RCB which has played three finals.

Team 7 in group A is DC which has one final appearance and two play-offs while corresponding Team 8 in group B is Punjab Kings with one final appearance.

Newcomers Lucknow Super Giants is Team 9 in group A and Gujarat Titans is corresponding team 10 in group B.

IPL 2022 Playing Pattern - Which Team Will Face Whom?

Each team will play twice with the teams in their group and with the team in the same row in the second group. With the rest of the teams in the second group they will play only once during the season.

Verreynne ton flattens New Zealand

Kyle Verreynne's enterprising unbeaten innings of 136* and his crucial partnerships with Wiaan Mulder and Kagiso Rabada extended South Africa's dominance over New Zealand in the second Test. The visitors declared their second essay at 354 for 9 at Tea on Day 4 leaving New Zealand to chase down a massive target of 426.

The aim of Verreynne and Rabada would have been to up the ante and look for quick runs in the afternoon session and the pair executed the plan to near-perfection by crunching a slew of big shots. In the 84th over Rabada lofted and slogged Tim Southee for a boundary and a six to make his intentions clear. The lower order batter continued to flay New Zealand's attack to all corners of the ground by collecting a boundary and a six in the next over.

Southee's day didn't get any better with Rabada thumping him over long-on and deep midwicket stands a couple more times. Verreynne too joined in the act by picking up boundaries off Kyle Jamieson and Henry. Eventually Rabada holed out to the fielder stationed at long-on off Henry. After Rabada was dismissed Verreynne completed his maiden Test hundred with a flick shot off Henry. The chuffed 'keeper-batter celebrated the milestone with a roar.

He soon pressed the accelerator pedal and hit top gear by clubbing Jameson for three boundaries and a six. On the other hand New Zealand were left frustrated as Jamieson dropped the last man Lutho Sipamla off the bowling of Southee. New Zealand then decided to bowl a barrage of bumpers at Sipamla with Southee clonking his helmet grille a couple of times. With Wagner also sticking to the same plan against the number 11 batter Dean Elgar decided South Africa had enough runs on the board as he opted to declare.

The foundation stone for South Africa finding themselves in pole position was set by the pair of Verreynne and Mulder in the morning session. With the old Kookaburra at their disposal New Zealand's pace bowlers - Southee Henry Kyle Jamieson and Neil Wagner - were intent on banging it short. However with the conditions turning out to be decent for batting Verreynne and Mulder employed the pull shot to good effect.

After losing his batting partner Mulder Verreynne constructed another useful alliance of 27 with Marco Jansen. Jansen was more intent on defence as he looked to give Verreynne company. On the other hand the 'keeper-batter brought out the cut to negate the threat of Wagner's shorter length deliveries. At the stroke of Lunch break Will Young took a one-handed blinder at midwicket to send Jansen back to the hut as the visitors lost their seventh wicket.

Brief Scores: South Africa 364 (Sarel Erwee 108 Aiden Markram 42; Neil Wagner 4-104 Matt Henry 3-90) & 354/9 decl. (Kyle Verreynne 136) lead New Zealand 293 (Colin de Grandhomme 120 Daryl Mitchell 60; Kagiso Rabada 5-60 Marco Jansen 4-98) by 425 runs

Graeme McCormick who stood to become SNP president in 2023 earlier claimed he could gather the 100 signatures needed from 20 different party branches to mount a challenge for the leadership.

However McCormick’s decision not to pursue a leadership bid leaves Swinney the former deputy first minister of Scotland as the only official candidate after Humza Yousaf announced he is stepping down. The deadline for nominations is noon on Monday.

McCormick said he reached the nomination threshold of 100 signatures but chose to back Swinney after a “lengthy and fruitful conversation” and said this could be a “fresh start”.

In a statement on Sunday night he said: “John and I agreed the challenges which the SNP our government and our people face and explored new thinking on a range of issues which I am confident as they are advanced will inspire activists both within the SNP and wider independence movement in the following weeks and months.

“This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians and I’m sure that John’s determination to deliver independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.

“I have therefore concluded that I shall not proceed with my nomination for party leader but instead support John Swinney’s nomination for party leader and first minister of Scotland.”

McCormick’s supporters had argued it would have been undemocratic for the party’s leader to win an unopposed coronation and insist that Swinney ought to face a contest. He won applause from hardliners when he denounced the SNP’s caution over mounting a second independence referendum without Westminster’s approval as “flatulence in a trance” during last year’s party conference.

One of McCormick’s backers Iain Lawson earlier attacked Swinney for criticising the planned challenge and in another post accused Swinney of being entitled and “raging” that an ordinary member was going up against him.

Swinney who described himself as the candidate to unite the party after a “difficult” few years said an election contest would delay the SNP’s essential rebuild. But he signalled he would win any potential contest telling Sky News that party members “probably know the outcome” between the two potential candidates.

His call for SNP members to realise the urgency of the need to restore public confidence in the party was underlined by a poll by Norstat for Sunday Times Scotland which said support for the party in a Westminster election had slumped to 29%.

The poll the first to be carried out since Yousaf suddenly quit last week put Labour on 34% and the Scottish Conservatives on 16%. Those figures suggest the SNP could lose 28 Westminster seats a fall from 43 MPs at present to 15. Labour which has only two Scottish seats would win 28.

Once Swinney is named the next SNP leader he will have to win a subsequent vote in Holyrood later in the week to become Scotland’s first minister.

The SNP said it does not comment on such matters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vc3RlZWxlcnNkZXBvdC5jb20vMjAyNC8wNS9oZXMtYW4tdWx0cmEtZXhwZXJpZW5jZWQtZnJlYWstYnJldHQta29sbG1hbm4tbmFtZXMtbWFzb24tbWNjb3JtaWNrLWJlc3Qtc3RlZWxlcnMtdmFsdWUtcGljay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'He's An Ultra-Experienced Freak': Brett Kollmann Names Mason McCormick Best Steelers' Value Pick,"Adblocker is on ×

It means the party will avoid a three-week leadership contest which would have been triggered had Mr McCormick not stepped aside and received the required 100 nominations.

Assuming there are no last-minute challengers the leadership bid will not have to be put to SNP members and Mr Swinney is likely to become Scotland's next first minister as early as Tuesday.

Barring a bombshell - Swinney will become leader today Connor Gillies Scotland correspondent @ConnorGillies The SNP establishment is quietly breathing a sigh of relief after a wildcard challenger pulled the plug. Grassroots member Graeme McCormick has been a thorn in the side of the party hierarchy for a long time but the truth is he never stood a chance of becoming leader. Apparently he was gathering the required 100 signatures from party members on his clipboard at an independence rally in Glasgow on Saturday. It doesn't get more grassroots than that. His move to trigger a contest would have delayed the inevitable Swinney win but it would have forced the party to spend three weeks having another internal debate. It would have been difficult (and embarrassing) for Mr Swinney and co as they try and pull a divided party back together. Mr McCormick told Sky News he had a discussion with Mr Swinney on Sunday and it seems the pair came to some sort of agreement. Many will see this as a small diplomatic win for the incoming first minister as he uses soft power to spare the SNP’s blushes. Barring a bombshell Mr Swinney will become leader tomorrow and first minister of Scotland on Tuesday as Humza Yousaf packs his bags and heads for the same door he kicked the Greens out of a few weeks ago.

""I think that is necessary as the SNP is not as cohesive today as the party needs to be and my campaign has attracted very wide support.

Along with last year’s first-round selection of tackle Broderick Jones and recent free-agent signings of starters James Daniels in 2022 and Isaac Seumalo in 2023 it seemed as though the job was complete. So when the Steelers were getting ready to make their fourth-round pick few were expecting it to be used on another offensive lineman.

Mason McCormick of South Dakota State would hear his name called with pick No. 119 and become the newest Steeler. Was this pick just meant to add depth or did the Steelers look past other obvious needs thinking they may have found a potential starter in McCormick? As a prospect McCormick was considered a versatile offensive lineman with the ability to play all five positions even though the 57 starts of his college career were spent exclusively at left guard. With the highest possible picks being used to select both tackles and a center over the past two drafts it would appear that McCormick’s fastest (only?) path to playing time is at guard. McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Who might that be?

The Steelers rebuild their offensive line

In May of 2022 Omar Khan was named general manager of the Steelers and Andy Weidl was hired for the assistant GM job. Weidl has largely been credited with the push to rebuild the offensive line. Since their hiring Khan and Weidl have replaced every offensive lineman they inherited except left tackle Dan Moore and Daniels. Using back-to-back first-round picks on college left tackles demonstrates their desire to upgrade from Moore. In their first go-around at free agency they spent money on guards Seumalo and Nate Herbig. Both started their careers with the Eagles when Weidl was in the player personnel department in Philadelphia. Things looked solid with Daniels Seumalo and Herbig giving the Steelers three veteran players to man the two guard spots.

Just a month after spending that money the Steelers would use 4 of their 30 allowed pre-draft visits to meet with more guards. At the 2022 draft they would use a seventh-round pick on Spencer Anderson. Anderson like McCormick was touted to have the versatility to potentially play all five positions. He would make the final 53-man roster as a depth player on the interior as the Steelers had four players (Moore Jones Chuks Okorafor and Dylan Cook) make it specifically as tackles.

It doesn’t make enough sense to use a fourth-round pick on McCormick simply for more interior depth with Seumalo Daniels Herbig and Anderson already on the roster. It’s highly unlikely that the Steelers would keep all five. At tackle Moore is the only one with a season’s worth of experience. Jones and Fautanu are locks to make the final 53. Cook lacks experience and versatility but would the Steelers use a fourth-round pick just to replace the fourth tackle when Anderson already supplies that same ability?

Related Pittsburgh Steelers select Washington OT Troy Fautanu with 20th overall pick in 2024 NFL Draft

McCormick is most likely pushing someone off of the roster. Cook Herbig and Daniels are in the final years of their contracts but Daniels is the only one who wasn’t hand-picked by Khan and Weidl. Moving Daniels would create an additional $8.25 million in 2024 cap space. If the Steelers are happy with their alternatives it would make sense to include Daniels in a trade before the start of the season and it would make more sense out of drafting McCormick instead of addressing other needs.

By the end of training camp don’t be surprised if Daniels has a new home elsewhere. Even though it was against FCS competition don’t be shocked if McCormick’s 57 starts at guard are the reason why.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Casey leads GOP rival in Pennsylvania Senate race: Poll,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4630466-pennsylvania-senate-bob-casey-david-mccormick/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDYzMDQ2Ni1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtc2VuYXRlLWJvYi1jYXNleS1kYXZpZC1tY2Nvcm1pY2sv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80NjMwNDY2LXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS1zZW5hdGUtYm9iLWNhc2V5LWRhdmlkLW1jY29ybWljay9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Screenshot by ZDNet

There's always something new at McDonald's. Not so much on the menu but more in the sphere of how to please more customers with fewer employees and a more judicious use of technology.

Recently it emerged that McDonald's has decided that delivery apps such as Uber Eats and DoorDash were charging too much for their services. So the burger chain renegotiated its contract and declared its franchisees would now be able to make more money.

More details however have emerged about another aspect of the new McDonald's-DoorDash relationship. The Wall Street Journal reports it isn't all one-way traffic.

It seems that if a particular McDonald's restaurant is slow to prepare a customer's delivery order DoorDash will impose penalties. And if a McDonald's restaurant messes up an order then it will have to accept the costs of that mistake. All of it.

At first bite this all seems good for the customer. Orders should be accurate and they'll be more likely to arrive on time.

Naturally I have fears.

If there's one thing McDonald's and DoorDash have in common it's that both are currently finding it very challenging to hire humans. Many people believe these companies don't pay enough and the work isn't attractive enough. Full employment can do that to human judgment.

In some areas therefore might delivery times be lengthened because the restaurant and DoorDash both know they can't deliver quickly? And why would a McDonald's restaurant agree to this timing knowing it will incur penalties?

Won't it be like airlines who pad their schedules in order to improve their on-time statistics?

This leads me to a beacon of odd hope for those who prefer to venture to a McDonald's drive-thru or even -- should they remember how -- to actually sit in a McDonald's restaurant. This even applies to those who stick to delivery.

In a recent announcement McDonald's also declared that it's going to open restaurants in new locations.

You might think there's nothing new about this. Yet McDonald's currently has the fewest locations it's had in 20 years. It closed 239 restaurants in 2021. As for opening new ones it hasn't done that for eight years.

If there are more McDonald's in more places you might think swifter deliveries remain possible. You might think DoorDash might hire more people precisely because there's a new McDonald's nearby.

It's all a wondrous business balancing act.

If -- no when -- the pandemic has finally slipped away will human habits change again? Will humans crave eating out rather than dining at home?

Can technology create more efficiencies to keep everyone happy -- and to encourage humans to work at McDonald's again?

In essence technology's job is speed and ease. If robot ordering works for a drive-thru robots may also be taking your orders everywhere and making your burgers. The future of fast-food is to be a robotic vending machine. A really nice big one.

Of course robots will soon deliver your food too.

When that glorious day arrives DoorDash will never have to penalize a McDonald's restaurant ever again.

It's been stuck in my head all morning on a loop so I had to listen to it just now.

""McDonald's hamburgers are the worst

Willis is considered an outsider musician. His songs include absurdist funny and sometimes obscene lyrics which are sung over the auto accompaniment feature on his Technics KN keyboard.

While he appreciated these awards he most valued the camaraderie and fun he had with his colleagues and friends. 'FutureCare' a business he founded in the late 1980's with friends from Medtronic laid the groundwork for today's telemedicine and remote care. FutureCare was unfortunately ahead of its time but Tom lived long enough to see his vision of improving health care access especially in rural areas fulfilled. Tom pursued many other interests throughout his life most notably photography. He went on several photographic trips took classes from artist Wing Huie and filled books and slide carousels with photos of family friends and complete strangers. He also showed cattle in 4H tinkered with robots wrote haiku and poetry studied graphic design was an avid reader especially of Sufi mystic poet Rumi and loved listening to music especially jazz. More than anything Tom loved spending time with his family. We fondly remember camping trips fishing posing for photos 'take your children to work' days visits to Grandma Jirak's store in Jackson Junction Iowa that canoe adventure with the grandchildren and sharing music good food and drinks.

The need-to-know this morning

Pfizer appointed Andrew Baum as its new chief strategy and innovation officer. Baum joins Pfizer from the investment bank Citi where he served as head of global healthcare research. He is joining Pfizer’s executive committee and will report to Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.

In a mid-stage study EyePoint Pharmaceuticals said its eye drug Duravyu failed to improve disease control compared to a sham injection in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

A deep dive into Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide

There so much buzz around Amgen’s experimental obesity drug MariTide. The company simply saying it was “very encouraged” about interim Phase 2 data led to a 12% spike in Amgen’s stock — even though no new data were shared. STAT’s Elaine Chen answers some hot questions about the closely watched injectable.

Early data show MariTide a monoclonal antibody drug could potentially offer more profound weight loss than other treatments on the market. But it’s already difficult to manufacture peptide drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — and antibodies are more complex molecules.

Although Novo and Lilly’s stocked dropped a little on Friday the companies are dominating the space and it’d be hard for competitors to catch up. The two companies are also developing next-generation candidates that are further ahead than MariTide. So even if other companies have strong contenders in the obesity space they’d be years away from an FDA approval and “so far behind [Novo and Lilly] that it’s still going to probably be hard to see how they catch up” one analyst said.

Studying stem cells and cancer in low Earth orbit

Turns out the microgravity of low Earth orbit allows scientists to study cancer growth at an accelerated clip. Catriona Jamieson of UCSD’s Sanford Stem Cell Institute is working with NASA to send tumors and stem cells into space — ferried aboard SpaceX and Axiom-3 flights to the International Space Station. STAT’s Nicholas St. Fleur chatted with Jamieson about why aging and oncology could potentially be better understood so far away from our planet.

She was inspired by a 2019 NASA study that showed that after 340 days in space astronaut Scott Kelly came back 2 inches taller than his earthbound twin.

“But then I noticed he had inversions and translocations in his chromosomes. His chromosomes were kind of mixed up in the immune cells which can happen if you have preleukemic conditions developing in your blood so that doesn’t look good” she said. “I thought maybe space is a way to understand stem cell aging when it starts to be premalignant and fully malignant but in an abbreviated time frame.”

Former Spark CTO suing for alleged discrimination

The former chief technical officer of Spark Therapeutics alleges she experienced discrimination and sexism while working there the Philadelphia Business Journal writes. Cynthia Pussinen led nearly 400 employees in Spark’s technical development and operations unit from February 2021 to December 2022.

Pussinen said she faced “repeated and ongoing acts and practices of sex discrimination by some of her male peers and colleagues most notably by Federico Mingozzi” who was the company’s chief scientific officer before leaving this past November. The lawsuit said that CEO Ron Philip allegedly told Pussinen in March 2022 that he was aware of Mingozzi’s “mistreatment” of women. But instead of sanctioning him she alleges Philip told her to “make it work” because everyone but Mingozzi is “expendable” and that “we need him more than he needs us.”

Pussinen who is now CEO of a small regenerative medicine company called Sernova is seeking unspecified economic damages along with compensatory damages for pain and suffering and emotional distress.

Merck may have a competition for ever-scarce BCG

There’s long been a global shortage of the BCG vaccine which has long been used to treat bladder cancer. This may change as FiercePharma points out. A couple of weeks back ImmunityBio won FDA approval for Anktiva an immunotherapy that’s meant to be used along with the BCG vaccine to treat patients with bladder cancer. Now ImmunityBio has partnered with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture BCG globally.

ImmunityBio framed it in a press release as “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and intends to produce the treatment “at large scale” so it can be used in combination with Anktiva. Merck has been the only U.S. purveyor of BCG since 2012 after Sanofi and another competitor bowed out due to manufacturing issues. In 2020 Merck laid out plans to boost BCG production but that will likely not come to fruition until at least next year. It’s been rationing BCG since 2019.

Notably an oncolytic virus-based therapeutic made by CG Oncology showed a complete response in about 75% of patients with late-stage bladder cancer new Phase 3 data show. If approved the drug could be used without the aid of BCG.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

""We have confidence in a successful launch of Winrevair consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress"" Litchfield said.

Merck is also cutting costs under a new restructuring program it announced in February. Those efforts aim to improve the manufacturing network of both its pharmaceutical division and animal health business.

The company recorded charges of $246 million related to restructuring in the first quarter which are excluded from its adjusted results.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck raises 2024 profit forecast on surging sales of cancer drug Keytruda,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-raises-2024-profit-forecast-strong-cancer-hpv-drugs-sales-2024-04-25/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGhjYXJlLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2Fscy9tZXJjay1yYWlzZXMtMjAyNC1wcm9maXQtZm9yZWNhc3Qtc3Ryb25nLWNhbmNlci1ocHYtZHJ1Z3Mtc2FsZXMtMjAyNC0wNC0yNS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTgvaGVhbHRoL2hwdi12YWNjaW5lLWFmcmljYS1tZXJjay5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Millions of Girls in Africa Will Miss HPV Shots After Merck Production Problem,"Nearly 1.5 million teenage girls in some of the world’s poorest countries will miss the chance to be protected from cervical cancer because the drugmaker Merck has said it will not be able to deliver millions of promised doses of the HPV vaccine this year.

Merck has notified Gavi the international organization that helps low- and middle-income countries deliver lifesaving immunizations and UNICEF which procures the vaccines that it will deliver only 18.8 million of the 29.6 million doses it was contracted to deliver in 2024 Gavi said.

That means that more than 10 million girls will not receive their expected HPV shots this year — and 1.5 million of them most likely will never get them because they will be too old to qualify for the vaccine in subsequent years.

Patrick Ryan a spokesman for Merck said the company “experienced a manufacturing disruption” that required it to hold and reinspect many doses by hand. He declined to give further details about the cause of the delay."

YouTube said Saturday that it will temporarily halt the ability of a number of Russian channels including state-sponsored RT to monetize their content on the platform.

It will also be “significantly limiting” recommendations to those channels YouTube said in a statement.

The company said the channels are affiliated with recent sanctions and that it has restricted access to RT and other channels in Ukraine in response to a request from that country’s government.

Earlier Saturday Ukraine Digital Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said on Twitter he contacted YouTube asking the platform to block “the propagandist Russian channels” and specifically mentioned Russia 24 TASS and RIA Novosti.

In 2017 the US Justice Department forced RT’s American arm to “register as a foreign agent.” Intelligence researchers have said RT “conducts strategic messaging for [the] Russian government.”

As the crisis in Ukraine intensifies social media companies have been scrambling to rein in misinformation and Russian state propaganda. A YouTube spokesperson said the company has removed hundreds of channels and thousands of videos over the past few days including channels for coordinated deceptive practices.

The move by YouTube follows the ban announced Friday by Meta on Russian state media’s ability to run ads and monetize them on Meta’s platform. Meta’s head of security policy Nathaniel Gleicher said on Twitter Saturday that the company will continue putting labels on additional Russian state media posts.

“These changes have already begun rolling out and will continue into the weekend” Gleicher tweeted Friday. “We are closely monitoring the situation in Ukraine and will keep sharing steps we’re taking to protect people on our platform.”

Also on Friday the Russian government moved to “partially restrict” Facebook (FB) access in the country after accusing the platform of unlawful censorship. Russia’s Ministry of Communications claimed Facebook (FB) “violated the rights and freedoms of Russian citizens” alleging that the social network had clamped down on several Russian media outlets Thursday.

Meta global affairs president Nick Clegg said Russia ordered the company to “stop the independent fact-checking and labelling” of four Russian outlets.

“We refused” Clegg said in a statement. “Ordinary Russians are using our apps to express themselves and organize for action. We want them to continue to make their voices heard share what’s happening and organize.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAyLzI2L3lvdXR1YmUtbWV0YS10d2l0dGVyLXJlc3RyaWN0LXJ1c3NpYW4tc3RhdGUtbWVkaWHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google joins YouTube Meta Twitter in restricting Russian state media ads,"Google announced late Saturday it is blocking Russian state media channels from selling ads due to the invasion of Ukraine. Why it matters: The move came hours after YouTube which is owned by Google said it was blocking Russian state media channels including RT from selling ads on YouTube globally or being accessible in Ukraine.

Twitter and Facebook have announced similar efforts to restrict Russian state accounts from being able to spread disinformation via advertising.

Details: A Google spokesperson told Axios the company was ""pausing Google monetization of Russian state-funded media across our platforms"" in ""response to the war in Ukraine.""

""We're actively monitoring new developments and will take further steps if necessary"" the spokesperson added.

A YouTube spokesperson told Axios earlier Saturday that the platform was ""pausing a number of channels’ ability to monetize on YouTube including several Russian channels affiliated with recent sanctions"" due to ""extraordinary circumstances in Ukraine.""

They added that YouTube will be “significantly limiting recommendations to these channels.""

""And in response to a government request we’ve restricted access to RT and a number of other channels in Ukraine. We will continue to monitor new developments and may take further actions.""

Background: On Friday Facebook parent Meta said it would prohibit Russian state media ""from running ads or monetizing on our platform anywhere in the world"" per a tweet from Facebook's head of security policy Nathaniel Gleicher.

Twitter on Friday also said it would temporarily pause advertisements in Ukraine and Russia ""to ensure critical public safety information is elevated and ads don’t detract from it.""

State of play: Facebook and Twitter as well as other social networking companies have for many months labeled accounts for outlets such as RT and Sputnik as Russian state media accounts.

But Russia is beginning to push back against efforts to fact-check content from those accounts partially restricting Twitter and Facebook.

The big picture: Tech platforms have in the past restricted ads during times of uncertainty around breaking news to stop disinformation from spreading. Google and Facebook most notably paused political ads around the 2020 election.

If you're an investor in growth companies it is likely that only a few stocks will drive your returns over the long haul. These are companies like Netflix Amazon and Apple stocks that appreciate many times in value over a decade or longer more than compensating for any losers in your portfolio. Given the recent growth of Upstart Holdings (UPST 6.62%) it looks like the disruptive lending platform has a chance to become one of these long-term compounders for growth investors. If that is the case I thought it would be interesting to compare the company to one of the mega-cap technology giants and see whether it had the potential to match their size a decade from now.

Upstart is a company that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to rate consumer creditworthiness angling to upend the financial industry's reliance on the traditional FICO score -- a measure that doesn't always give an accurate read on a borrower's credit risk. Will it be worth more than technology giant Meta Platforms (META 3.04%)  formerly Facebook by 2030? Let's find out.

2021 growth was insanely strong

Upstart had a phenomenal 2021 as it saw continued adoption among its banking partners and expanded heavily into automotive lending. Total revenue in 2021 was $849 million up 264% from 2020. Loan volume hit $11.8 billion up 338% year over year. Loan volume is an important metric to track because Upstart takes a fee on every loan so the more loan volume that its bank partners originate (Upstart is typically not make loans itself) the more in fee revenue it will earn.

Even though it is growing rapidly Upstart is highly profitable. In 2021 Upstart had $135 million in net income giving the company a 16% net margin. As the company matures over the next five to 10 years and stops investing so heavily for growth investors should expect its net income margin to expand.

Along with its 2021 earnings report Upstart management put out guidance for this year. In 2022 it expects revenue to hit $1.4 billion which would be 65% year-over-year growth. While not as strong as the 264% growth in 2021 if Upstart can consistently put up strong double-digit growth each year this business will be much bigger a decade from now.

Market opportunity is large but there's a catch

Upstart's management believes there is a $6 trillion annual loan origination opportunity for the company to go after. The majority of this total addressable market -- or TAM -- is in mortgage lending which has an estimated $4.6 trillion in annual loan volume. Automotive and personal lending the two categories Upstart currently operates in have combined annual loan volumes of $823 billion.

Upstart handled only $11.8 billion in loan originations in 2021 so there's still plenty of room to grow just within personal and auto loans. However if the company is to become the dominant lending platform around the world it is going to have to crack the mortgage market at some point. It also should be noted that even though $6 trillion seems like a gigantic market (and it is) Upstart only sees a small portion of each loan it originates as revenue. For example off of the $11.8 billion in loan volume in 2021 Upstart earned $801 million in fee revenue or 6.8% of loan volumes. Investors should remember this when looking at the $6 trillion loan market Upstart is going after.

Becoming larger than Meta Platforms seems unlikely

As of this writing Upstart has a market cap of about $11 billion. Meta Platforms even after its huge sell-off over the last few months has a market cap of about $570 billion. If Upstart is to reach a market cap of $570 billion by 2030 its stock price will need to compound at 55% per year from now until then. This is much higher than the historical annual return for the stock market of 10%.

Let's take a look at it from a different perspective by comparing Meta's net income to Upstart's. In 2021 Meta generated $39.4 billion in net income. Upstart as mentioned above generated $135 million. To match Meta's 2021 net income through the end of 2030 Upstart will need to increase its bottom line by 88% a year for nine straight years. While certainly not impossible it is improbable that Upstart -- or any company really -- can grow that quickly for that long. In all likelihood unless Meta's market value goes down considerably from now until 2030 Upstart stock will not be worth more than the social media giant by then.

Upstart might not be a future technology giant but that doesn't mean it will be a bad investment. If the company continues increasing its loan volume and eventually moves into mortgages Upstart's stock will likely be much higher in 2030 than today. This makes the stock an attractive opportunity for growth investors with a long-term time horizon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3ZpZGVvLzYyOTg5NTAwMjYwMDHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meta bans Russian state media advertisements on its social media platforms,Log in to comment on videos and join in on the fun.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLzIvMjYvZmFjZWJvb2stYmFucy1ydXNzaWEtc3RhdGUtbWVkaWEtZnJvbS1ydW5uaW5nLWFkdmVydHMtbW9uZXRpc2luZ9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvMjAyMi8yLzI2L2ZhY2Vib29rLWJhbnMtcnVzc2lhLXN0YXRlLW1lZGlhLWZyb20tcnVubmluZy1hZHZlcnRzLW1vbmV0aXNpbmc?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Facebook bans Russia state media from running adverts monetising,"Move comes hours after Moscow said it was limiting access to Facebook amid fact-checking dispute and invasion of Ukraine.

Facebook says it has restricted Russian state media’s ability to earn money on the social media platform as Moscow’s invasion of neighbouring Ukraine reached the streets of Kyiv.

“We are now prohibiting Russian state media from running ads or monetising on our platform anywhere in the world” Nathaniel Gleicher the social media giant’s security policy head said on Twitter on Friday.

He added that Facebook would “continue to apply labels to additional Russian state media”.

Facebook’s parent company Meta said earlier on Friday that Russia would hit its services with restrictions after it refused authorities’ order to stop using fact checkers and content warning labels on its platforms.

Social media networks have become one of the fronts in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine home to sometimes misleading information but also real-time monitoring of a quickly developing conflict that marks Europe’s biggest geopolitical crisis in decades.

“Yesterday Russian authorities ordered us to stop the independent fact-checking and labelling of content posted on Facebook by four Russian state-owned media organisations” Meta’s Nick Clegg said in a statement. “We refused.”

His statement came hours after Russia’s media regulator said it was limiting access to Facebook accusing the American tech giant of censorship and violating the rights of Russian citizens.

On Wednesday Facebook also released a feature in Ukraine that allows people to lock their profiles for increased security using a tool the company also deployed after Afghanistan fell to the Taliban last year.

Gleicher said Facebook had set up a special operations centre to monitor the situation in Ukraine “in response to the unfolding military conflict”."

The Massachusetts Gaming Commission recently announced that it had collected more than $3.7 million in 2021 as part of the state’s “jackpot intercept” program.

Under the program created by state legislation Massachusetts’ three gaming licensees partnering with the commission’s Investigations and Enforcement Bureau check a database to determine if a jackpot winner owes back taxes to the state or child support to a former spouse.

Whenever someone wins a jackpot of more than $1200 in slots or a table jackpot of $5000 or that pays out at 300-to-1 odds that person’s name and Social Security number has to be run through the Department of Revenue to see if they owe any back taxes or back child support.

Nineteen other states have similar programs. Nevada isn’t one of them.

No Nevada law just yet

Nevada hasn’t approved such a law yet but it’s not for lack of trying. State lawmakers tried to develop one with legislation debated in March 2021.

Proponents of Assembly Bill 406 passed a section of the bill supporting the concept of intercepting jackpots to pay delinquent child support but the details of how that would be done were left for consideration in the next legislative session in 2023.

Last year’s bill testimony indicated the technology of the system could be ready this year and that details of implementation could be debated when the Legislature convenes next January.

“The Nevada Child Support Enforcement Program has over 83500 open child support cases” said Cathy Kaplan chief of the Child Support Enforcement Program for the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services Department of Health and Human Services.

“Of those cases there are over 68000 obligors who are in arrears with their child support obligations” she said. “Existing statute allows past-due support to be withheld when an obligor wins a prize or lottery. However there are no current processes for licensed gaming establishments to identify delinquent obligors and withhold from their gambling winnings.”

Karen Cliffe chief deputy district attorney of the Family Support Division of the Clark County district attorney’s office cited Colorado casinos’ experience as a positive outcome of the institution of such legislation.

“For five years Colorado casinos fought off the legislation” Cliffe said.“They made their first collection the day it was implemented. That same year they collected $500000. To date well over $4 million has been collected.”

She noted that the executive director of the Colorado Gaming Association initially opposed legislation for fear that the child support review conducted before payout would be troublesome. “However their experience has been the opposite” she said. “It has been a very smooth transition.”

Cliffe said the Nevada bill reviewed by the Assembly Judiciary Committee last year had two sections: one requiring the state’s Department of Health and Human Services to establish and maintain a secure registry for the purpose of withholding gaming winnings and the other amending Nevada Revised Statutes to include gaming winnings as funds that may be withheld for the support of a child.

Under the bill “gaming winnings” are defined as winnings at a licensed gaming establishment that are required to be reported to the IRS on form W-2G.

‘Significant undertaking’

But others say the size and complexity of Nevada’s gaming industry makes such a law more difficult to implement.

The Nevada Resort Association representing 77 casino companies statewide recognized the benefit of a child support jackpot intercept system but disagreed with the execution of the bill.

“Our concerns with AB406 as initially drafted were centered on details and logistics rather than the concept” NRA President and CEO Virginia Valentine said. “Due to the size and complexity of Nevada’s gaming industry as compared to states with far fewer licensees a reasonable first step would be for the state to develop a reliable and secure IT system or database and ensure it works as intended with adequate data privacy protections before mandating an untested system.”

Valentine said that after the system becomes operational she recommends a pilot program to address any issues such as appropriate controls and employee training including who has access to the sensitive information and the impacts to licensees in terms of staffing and operations.

“This is a significant undertaking that must be done properly from the beginning” she said.

Former Nevada Gaming Control Board Chairwoman Becky Harris now a distinguished fellow in gaming and leadership at UNLV’s International Gaming Institute said she is neither for nor against the Nevada legislation but she pointed out some of the issues that lawmakers will face.

“We haven’t done a study to see who’s actually winning our jackpots” said Harris who also served two legislative sessions as a state senator. “We are an international destination. That’s not to say that in Massachusetts they don’t have international visitation but you can’t even compare Massachusetts to Nevada because they have three licensees and when you look across restricted and non-restricted (licenses in Nevada) we’re at almost 3000.”

Harris also questioned whether casino properties would have to track child-support obligors from other states and which casinos would have to withhold jackpots in the case of progressive slot wins.

“It’s a whole different conversation when the question becomes who is going to be subject to this because we have progressive jackpots that go across properties” she said. “Who is going to be responsible for making sure there’s compliance? Is it the property where the jackpot hit or is it the responsibility of all the properties that contributed to the jackpot? I’m sure they can figure it out but it seems to me that any legislation that deals with this is going to have to exempt international travelers and we’re probably going to have to exempt people from out of state because I don’t know how you require Nevada licensees to comply with knowing what all the child-support laws guidelines and arrears are in 50 states let alone all over the world.”

Another question: If jackpot intercepts are in place could that produce a chilling effect on the local population’s willingness to play?

“I think it becomes a challenge because we do have a responsibility to make sure that the games are fair and part of the fairness of those games is that when you win you get paid” Harris said.

Intercepting jackpots

Last year Encore Boston Harbor operated by Las Vegas-based Wynn Resorts Ltd. intercepted $2.2 million Penn National Gaming's Plainridge Park Casino captured $921595 and MGM Resorts International's MGM Springfield diverted $633937 as part of Massachusetts' jackpot interception program.

Bruce Band deputy director of the Investigations and Enforcement Bureau said 2021 was a record year for intercepting back tax and child support funds.

Are gamblers surprised when they find out they're not going to collect the amount they thought they'd won?

""I think some of them are some to the extent that they try to switch the jackpot to somebody else"" Band said.

LAS VEGAS — Three men sat in separate chairs getting their hair cut Thursday at The Barbershop establishment inside The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.

If you wanted any kind of fade pompadour or wet shave then barbers like Rockstar Elizabeth or Gucci can get you looking and feeling fresh.

The receptionist asked for my name but I wasn't looking for a trim. Not today at least. I said I was media and so she led me through the store to what looked like the restroom.

Loud voices beckoned through the door as a speakeasy joint unveiled itself a gem hidden from beyond those prepping themselves for a night at the blackjack tables.

Camera crews stood with their gear on a stage and filmed six fighters who throw hands in three separate matches Saturday talk-up their chances during a pre-fight press conference.

Chris Colbert fights Hector Garcia in the weekend's Premier Boxing Champions headliner broadcast by Showtime Sports which takes place at the avant-garde The Chelsea venue inside The Cosmo.

The New Yorker with his dyed blue hair stole the show. He grabbed the mic interrogated his opponent and generated a raucous energy from his excitable teammates in the audience.

Ukrainian former world champion boxer Viktor Postol who fights fast-rising fighter Gary Antuanne Russell spoke about competing while his family remain in a country defending itself from a Russian invasion.

Showtime Sports boss Stephen Espinoza watched things unfold from the back of this secret room — one of many The Cosmopolitan can brag alongside other incognitio bars and restaurants tucked away inside this casino.

Playing on the theme of things hiding in plain sight I asked Espinoza who Showtime's best-kept secret is in boxing.

Showtime insiders are also high on Russell who takes on the toughest test of his career to date against the long Postol a jab-happy fighter accustomed to the big stage.

But Espinoza told Insider this week that because of ""the way the boxing audience has connected with them they're no longer secrets.

""I'm really optimistic about the future. When you look at Colbert Gary Antuanne Russell Brandun Lee — all of whom are young guys and not even close to reaching their peak"" he said. ""And we've got plenty of others.""

Bringing fights to Las Vegas is no secret — it is 'instrumental to the health of the sport'

And so it took me slightly by surprise that in three weekends of working events in this city as a resident I've been at the Mandalay Bay the UFC Apex and now The Cosmopolitan.

For Espinoza it's no great secret. ""One of the strengths of Vegas is the city support for all sizes of events"" he told Insider.

""We know about the bright lights and the casino support for the big mega events. But to have the level of support both from the community in the casino and the business environment for fights of this level is a really important step in developing fighters to have them in a first-class venue in a first-class casino and get all the support that comes to it.

""It's one of the reasons why Vegas is so instrumental to the health of the sport of boxing.""

But is it all just a pipe dream? IAG takes a closer look at what the future may hold.

Aside from the muslim majority nations of Indonesia and Brunei Thailand is the only ASEAN nation without a legal casino and yet it maintains strong connections to gambling. With a population of almost 70 million it has been estimated that as much as half of its adult population gambles via illegal means such as sports betting – more than THB160 billion (US$5 billion) is bet on football alone each year – or the many underground casinos that permeate major metropolitan centers.

Thailand has long been viewed as an attractive candidate to one day establish a legal casino industry.

“There is certainly demand” explains Vitaly Umansky Managing Director & Senior Analyst – Global Gaming for asset management firm AB Bernstein.

“There are obviously a bunch of gaming customers from Thailand that gamble all over the place. Poipet in Cambodia is a clear example of this which is almost entirely Thai customers.”

But Umansky asks is it all hopes and dreams?

This is the question currently facing the Thai parliament which in early December voted to set up an extraordinary committee to examine a proposal to open an integrated resort with a casino with the goal of attracting more foreign visitation and boosting the local economy.

The extraordinary committee is said to comprise 60 members of which 15 are cabinet representatives with the other 45 from various political parties. According to The Bangkok Post the committee will examine the legal amendments required to legalize casino gaming as well as the social and economic impact of IRs in other jurisdictions. A report could be complete as early as this month.

Sources Inside Asian Gaming spoke to however questioned the motives both behind the establishment of such a committee right now and of those involved. For example one senator closely linked to the committee is widely alleged to be the “godfather” of illegal gambling in Bangkok suggesting a clear conflict of interest.

If local media reports are to be believed this latest push for legalized casino gambling in Thailand is at least in part a result of the COVID-19 pandemic with Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said to be concerned that illegal gambling dens had become super spreader venues. As a result Prayut is apparently open to holding public discussions on the pros and cons of legalizing gambling despite being opposed to the idea himself.

Deputy Prime Minister Gen. Prawit Wongsuwan also noted in January that the absence of casinos in Thailand was no deterrent to its citizens gambling.

“Look at the countries around us” he said. “Our people visit those casinos too.”

Despite Prime Minister Prayut launching a crackdown on underground casinos – shortly after claiming the leadership by way of a military coup in 2014 – which sources say eliminated up to 80% of those in operation at the time a government panel established in February 2021 found there were still around 200 illegal gambling dens operating nationwide including 47 in the Bangkok metropolitan area.

Yet talk of legalizing casinos in Thailand is nothing new.

It was even somewhat close to becoming a reality back in 2003 when then-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra went as far as meeting with representatives of US casino giant MGM Resorts or MGM Mirage as it was known at the time. Rather than navigate the difficult path of passing a specific casino law Thaksin had recognized that simply amending the current Gambling Act of 1935 – which allows for betting on a small number of select activities such as horse racing cockfighting combat sports and the lottery – to include casinos was a more realistic path forward. He was likely correct but more pressing matters would ultimately consume Thaksin’s time before he fell victim to an earlier military coup in 2006.

In 2008 newly appointed Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej promised to open casinos in five major tourist centers – Pattaya Phuket Khon Kaen Chiang Mai and Hat Yai – if he served out his full four-year term.

“We have to seriously study the idea of how to open legal casinos” he said. “This way the illegal dens and private casinos will close down. If people want to gamble they can come here so the police won’t have to crack down on [the illegal dens].”

In the end Samak didn’t last four months let alone four years being sentenced to two years in jail on an old libel charge and fleeing to the United States.

What separates Thailand’s latest attempt to legalize casino gaming from those previous efforts – and gives some hope to proponents – is the monarchy. King Bhumibol Adulyadej who held the throne for almost 70 years until his death at the age of 88 in October 2016 was famously anti-gambling while his son and successor King Maha Vajiralongkorn is said to be intrigued by the idea of bringing to Thailand the type of multi-billion dollar integrated resorts seen in Macau and Singapore.

Certainly there is some merit to the notion.

A feasibility study conducted by an internationally renowned consultancy pre-COVID-19 recommended the development of “two or three” casinos in Thailand comprising a large-scale integrated resort in Bangkok and two smaller satellite casinos in tourist destinations.

Assuming investment levels of up to US$4 billion for the Bangkok IR – smaller for the satellite locations – the study estimated annual gross gaming revenues of between US$4 billion and US$4.7 billion for the three properties combined. That would rank right alongside Singapore whose two hugely successful integrated resorts Marina Bay Sands (MBS) and Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) generated combined GGR of US$4.51 billion in 2019.

Umansky however is wary of such comparisons.

“Singapore when they legalized casinos had a very clear objective of what they wanted to achieve” he says. “It was crystal clear what they wanted they ran a very good process they had outlined parameters it was highly legalistic the industry is well regulated – they had an objective. “The Singapore model was to build a giant family amusement leisure destination for long-term visitation (RWS) and a massive convention-based city-oriented property to bring in international business travelers (MBS) and in both cases gaming supports the development of all that.

“But in Thailand the question is ‘Why you would want to do this?’ Thailand is already a massive tourist destination so what are you trying to achieve? Giving locals somewhere to gamble so they don’t do it overseas? If that’s the objective you put [the IR] in Bangkok. If that’s not the goal you put it in Phuket or Pattaya but those beachfront casino resorts rarely work because the people that attend those locations don’t want to do a whole heap of gambling. The people that want to spend six hours on the beach are not the same people that want to spend six hours in a casino like in Macau.

“So we need to know what the government would want to achieve before we start considering where it makes sense to [put legalized casinos] because where it makes sense to have one is based on what it is you’re trying to achieve.”

Umansky is also highly dubious of aligning the desires of Thai authorities with those of operators particularly if banning locals were to become part of the agenda.

“Foreigner-only doesn’t work” he says pointing to the troubles COVID has created for Korea’s foreigner-only casino industry.

“I mean sure you can do a US$200 million property in Phuket and that will make a lot of money but that’s not what the government is going to allow. They’re going to want you to build a US$5 billion property catering only to foreigners and with an absurd tax rate – and none of it will ever pan out.”

Others aren’t so sure. According to sources who spoke to IAG on condition of anonymity Thailand is more likely to follow the lead of Singapore and Japan by introducing an entry fee in the realm of THB500 to THB1000 baht (US$15 to US$30) in an effort to exclude those who can’t afford to gamble.

“The market could be quite big” one source said. “Thailand had 13 million Chinese visitors in 2019 and that was on an upward trajectory. Chinese people love coming to Thailand so that’s huge. You’ve also got a lot of Thai people who go to Singapore Macau Europe America and Australia to gamble. So there is a market there for sure supplemented by a huge Chinese market.”

Based on the feasibility study referenced previously legalized casinos if open to all would attract an estimated 55/45 split of international visitors versus locals.

Outside of Bangkok and Phuket Pattaya is also mentioned as an obvious location. It was here that authorities had proposed opening an IR back in 2002 on the site of the Imperial Pattaya Hotel in Chon Buri.

“It makes even more sense today because it’s only an hour from the international airport it’s got all the tourist and visitor infrastructure and they are building a high-speed train to Bangkok so it actually meets many criteria” the source said.

On the downside a Pattaya integrated resort would almost certainly kill off the casino industry in Poipet which would undoubtedly stir up rapid opposition from powerful people in the Cambodian border town.

Similar issues would likely face any such development in Bangkok where the underground casinos are controlled some say “at a very very high level.”

Although far removed from the glitzy casino floors of Asia’s integrated resorts these often elaborate setups have been estimated to generate more than US$5.5 billion in revenue annually and are alleged to operate under the protection of authorities who are paid substantial monthly protection fees to provide tip-offs whenever a raid is imminent.

While any moves to create a regulated casino industry may meet with substantial resistance from those who profit from the current status quo the obstacles are not insurmountable.

“Thailand is a very ‘top down’ country so if the King says ‘This is going to happen and everyone must fall in line’ then it can happen although clearly there would be a lot of people opposed to having a legal casino” one source explains.

“At the same time the people running the underground casinos are almost a different market. If there was an entry fee [at the IRs] to keep out locals who shouldn’t be gambling that’s the market for underground casinos right there because they don’t care.

“As long as [the IR is] not in Bangkok then they could still profit from their illegal businesses.”

Proponents of legalizing casino gambling in Thailand present some strong arguments. In part due to COVID-19 decimating the tourism sector – which the Office of the National Economic and Social Development Council said contributed around 20% of Thailand’s GDP in 2020 – the Thai government has borrowed around THB1.5 trillion (US$46.4 billion) since the start of the pandemic pushing total public debt to its highest level in 21 years at over THB9.6 trillion (US$297 billion) equal to 58.3% of GDP.

At the same time the quality of tourists visiting Thailand measured by average tourist spend has been falling compared with some of its regional neighbors.

“They have needed something for some time to make Thailand more competitive” a source said.

Opposition to casinos apart from that voiced by the powerful Buddhist religion is also less vocal in Thailand than in places like Indonesia and Japan. Despite polls showing more people oppose than support casino development a 2019 study by the Center for Gambling Studies found that 57% of the population had gambled at least once in the previous 12 months.

Yet for all of this those IAG heard from – most speaking on condition of anonymity – universally said regulated casino gaming in Thailand remains long odds to become reality.

“I’m fairly cynical” said one highly experienced commentator.

“I just can’t see them achieving what they need to achieve. Too many snouts in the trough too many vested interests. I don’t see a clean properly regulated gaming industry in Thailand.

“I think there is a great opportunity there but I suspect the Thais will miss that opportunity just like the Japanese have. There would be too many people wanting a piece of the action. If they went about it the right way they could have a fantastically successful industry here but I’m cynical about them getting it right.”

Umansky is even more forthright.

“There is really no reason to look at Thailand – it’s a giant waste of time” he said.

“Could it be a good casino market? Yeah depending on how it’s structured. As with all things gaming it depends upon the regulatory environment and the tax structure and what you can and can’t do what you need to invest and that will determine whether it makes any sense.

“We’ve gone to numerous jurisdictions where they have had delusions of creating a Macau when it’s not feasible to do so because they are not Macau so they have either hoodwinked a bunch of investors or created a bunch of noise and nothing has come out of it.

“Thailand isn’t that severe because I don’t think they have ever given anyone the impression that anyone should do any real work in Thailand but if the government decided to do something it would take a very very long time and I’m skeptical over their ability to get the law and industry structure right from the perspective of it making any sense even if they proceed.”

“I don’t think so” replied another industry veteran when asked his thoughts on legal casino gaming in Thailand.

“At the end of the day I just don’t see good reason to do so. Here’s a country that already attracts 40 million tourists per year and has everything you could want in the way of tourism except for casino gaming.

The paper published by the Institute of International and Strategic Studies ( IISS ) at Peking University found that China is likely to be the bigger loser from the technological and economic decoupling under way between the two world powers. China lacks control over core computing systems the paper stated and is far behind America in a number of important areas such as semiconductors operating systems and aerospace. Within a week of its posting the document vanished.

The circumstances around its removal are unclear. Communist Party bosses may have decided it signals weakness at a time when Xi Jinping wants to project strength—his country’s the Communist Party’s and as he prepares to be anointed president for life later this year his own. The report’s conclusions are indeed inconvenient for Mr Xi. He has been talking up “self-strengthening” against what his government calls “chokeholds” that the West exerts over access to critical technologies from seeds to semiconductors. The power of the West to hobble its adversaries with sanctions is about to be tested in Russia which on February 24th attacked Ukraine (see Briefing).

In an interview with PC Gamer Newell says Valve has no plans for an Xbox Game Pass competitor but that it would be happy to work with Microsoft to bring PC Game Pass to Steam.

“I don’t think it’s something that we think we need to do ourselves building a subscription service at this time” Newell said. “But for their customers it’s clearly a popular option and we’d be more than happy to work with them to get that on Steam.”

Microsoft and Valve have held discussions about bringing PC Game Pass to Steam but it’s clearly early days and may never happen. “We’ve talked to people there quite a bit about that topic” says Newell. “If your customers want it then you should figure out how to make it happen. That’s where we’re at.”

A sticking point could be Valve’s 30 percent cut on software sales through Steam. Valve relaxes this to 20 percent for sales after $50 million but it’s not clear how it treats subscription services like PC Game Pass. EA Play launched on Steam in 2020 but only the basic subscription is available and EA Play Pro is still exclusive to EA’s Origin launcher.

Microsoft has so far shown no signs that it’s willing to bring PC Game Pass to Steam though. The software maker started distributing more of its Xbox Game Studios titles through Steam in 2019 but PC Game Pass remains exclusive to the Microsoft Store and Windows 10 or Windows 11 PCs. That means if you purchase a new Steam Deck you can’t access PC Game Pass on the Linux OS that’s preinstalled.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vd2luZG93cy0xMC1taWNyb3NvZnQtdGVhbXMtZml4LXZpZGVvLWxhZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Fix Video Lag in Microsoft Teams on Windows,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vd2luZG93cy0xMC1taWNyb3NvZnQtdGVhbXMtZml4LXZpZGVvLWxhZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzIvdmFsdmUtc3RlYW0tbWljcm9zb2Z0LXBjLWdhbWUtcGFzcy1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC1jb21tZW50c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Valve Is Open to Helping Microsoft Bring PC Game Pass to Steam,"With the massive popularity of PC Game Pass Valve says it’s open to helping Microsoft bring the feature over onto Steam.

Speaking about the company’s own video game storefront with PC Gamer Valve CEO Gabe Newell revealed that the digital distributor has no plans to create a subscription service for now but that it would be happy to work with Microsoft to incorporate its PC Game Pass. “I don’t think it’s something that we think we need to do ourselves building a subscription service at this time” Newell explained. “But for their customers it’s clearly a popular option and we’d be more than happy to work with them to get that on Steam.”

In fact there have already been talks between the two gaming giants but Newell shared no concrete plans to secure the partnership just yet. “We’ve talked to people there quite a bit about that topic” he added. “If your customers want it then you should figure out how to make it happen. That’s where we’re at.”

Unfortunately even if PC Game Pass does join Steam Steam Deck owners will still not be able to run those games in the beginning with the device operating only on Linux. The good news is that Valve and AMD are currently working on driver compatibility for Windows so those who install the second operating system might be able to tap in PC Game Pass after all.

Users may save files manually restore them using AutoRecover or use the AutoSave feature to save them to the Microsoft Cloud.

ADVERTISEMENT

AutoSave is displayed prominently in Word applications that support it. Starting in Office 2019 it is displayed in the top left corner of the interface. The traditional save button is displayed next to it in the interface.

The tooltip ""Save to OneDrive or SharePoint Online if you want to use AutoSave"" is displayed when you hover over the element in the Office interface.

AutoSave according to Microsoft is a cloud-based storage solution only. Office users need to have access to a personal or work OneDrive or SharePoint account to use the functionality.

Home users who use Office 2019 or 2021 may use their OneDrive account to save their documents to the cloud automatically using the feature. There is no option to use the feature with other cloud providers or locally.

Office users who want to save documents locally only can avoid AutoSave and rely on saving documents manually and the AutoRecover feature.

AutoRecover saves a document regularly by default in 10 minute intervals to a cache in the local system. It can be used to recover a document if an Office app crashes or something else happens that results in differences between the locally saved copy of the document and the AutoRecover version of it.

Microsoft Office users have a couple of options to customize the saving experience on their devices. Select File > Settings > Save to display preferences.

There you may change the following options:

Disable ""AutoSave OneDrive and SharePoint Online files by default"" -- This affects files that you open from online storages only.

Change the AutoRecover interval by modifying the ""Save AutoRecover information every .. minutes"" preference. LibreOffice supports the same functionality but it is turned off by default.

Change the AutoRecover cache location. Default is C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\[OFFICEAPPFOLDER]

Enable ""Save to computer by default"".

Change the default save location for local files and personal templates.

There is no option in Office 2019 or 2021 to use AutoSave locally according to Microsoft:

AutoSave is not available when working with local files. The old AutoRecovery behavior is still available to periodically save copies of changed files to help minimize data loss in the case of an unexpected scenario such as a crash.

AutoSave may have a number of implications on workflows especially in work environments. Microsoft published a huge list in a support article here are the highlights:

Editing existing files and saving them under new names e.g. when doing quarterly reports no longer works as the existing file is changed automatically as well.

Any change made to existing files with AutoSave enabled will be saved even if the user exists without hitting the save button e.g. when running what-if changes.

AutoSave can be disabled in the Group Policy. The latest Administrative Templates for Microsoft 365 Apps needs to be imported to make the change. Note that this applies to Office 2021 as well even though it is not mentioned.

Closing Words

AutoSave may be useful in work environments and also for home users who don't mind publishing their documents to the Microsoft cloud. Microsoft could have added an option to save documents locally when using AutoSave but it has not.

The feature has caused some confusion since its release with users wanting to find ways to save their documents locally when using it or removing the AutoSave element entirely from their documents instead. Günter Born mentioned it this week in a blog post on his site as well.

Now You: do you use Office? What is your take on the AutoSave restriction?

That’s right the company has decided to ditch Windows phones completely so the Lumia brand has already been abandoned while Windows 10 Mobile is a platform that no longer receives support.Microsoft on the other hand has decided to go the easy route so its mobile push now focuses on Android. The company has already released two Android devices called Surface Duo and Surface Duo 2 and both come with a dual-screen form factor allowing for a rather innovative approach.Needless to say given they are both Android devices they also support Android Auto  and just like any other phone out there they also struggle with various problems behind the wheel.Microsoft has tried to resolve some of them in the latest software update for the Surface Duo though on the other hand the company hasn’t provided any specifics on this work. The update to firmware version 2022.111.64 which is available right now on the original Surface Duo indicates users are provided with “improved reliability in the Android Auto experience.”The update is currently rolling out to users so if you haven’t received it just yet make sure you check for updates once again at a later time.Other than that the Surface Duo has one big advantage: given it comes with a dual-screen form factor it can very well be used as a full display to run apps like Google Maps and Waze. In other words if Android Auto isn’t working properly just launch your favorite navigation app switch to the tablet mode to get the full-screen estate and that’s pretty much it.The only thing you need is a solid phone holder but there are plenty of them out there anyway so the Surface Duo can always become a much more advanced Android Auto replacement in a matter of seconds."

With more scientists predicting COVID-19 boosters will be needed each year some are now working on combining those with the annual flu vaccine. The idea experts say is a single injection given each fall that protects against seasonal flu and COVID-19.

Pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Novavax have already announced plans to work on a combo shot but don't expect them to be available this upcoming flu season. Instead Moderna's CEO saying a combo shot could be ready by 2023.

Although studies indicate​ COVID-19 vaccine efficacy fades over time experts say it's not a foregone conclusion that every American will need an annual COVID-19 booster. Dr. Anthony Fauci the nation's top infectious disease expert said this week that as of right now most Americans don't need a fourth dose (beyond the existing booster shot) but scientists are constantly evaluating the situation.

“I think we first have to assess the long-term need for annual COVID vaccines” says Dr. Anna Durbin director of Center for Immunization Research at Johns Hopkins University.

However ""if there is a continued need for COVID vaccines then combining that with influenza would make sense"" Durbin said.

There are a few technical challenges to creating a combination vaccine. One is that different scientific approaches have been used for the two types of vaccines.

“Right now the influenza vaccine is a different platform"" said Durbin. The most widely used flu vaccines in the US contain ‘inactivated’ (killed) or attenuated (weakened) virus to trigger an immune response in the body. This differs from mRNA (or messenger RNA) vaccines which teach the body's cells how to make proteins that trigger immune responses. The result is that they currently have to be given in separate shots.

While two of the three authorized COVID vaccines are based on mRNA technology previous influenza vaccines have not utilized this technology. But now Moderna and Pfizer are working on an mRNA flu vaccine.

In addition to differences in technology an extra challenge is that the most common influenza vaccine in the U.S. is quadrivalent meaning it is designed to protect against four different flu viruses.

“This means the combined influenza/COVID vaccine would also likely need to be quadrivalent or at least trivalent. That makes the vaccine more complicated"" says Durbin.

Similarly the rise of new COVID variants may introduce challenges to vaccine development.

This past September Novavax enrolled people in a Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety tolerability and immune response of a combination vaccine using Novavax' seasonal influenza and COVID-19 vaccines. Unlike Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines which use mRNA these vaccines use protein subunit technology which introduces a fragment of the virus into the body that is recognized by the immune system and triggers a response. These have each previously demonstrated strong results as standalone vaccines in Phase 3 clinical trials.

Moderna has also announced that it is developing a single dose vaccine that combines a booster against COVID-19 and a booster against flu called mRNA-1073. In preclinical studies Moderna has observed that its seasonal flu and COVID-19 booster vaccines can be combined into one dose that produces an immune response to ​both viruses.

Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel predicted this combo shot could be available in 2023 -- not in time for this upcoming flu season but potentially the following year.

""I think it makes a lot of sense to try to develop these vaccines but it may take a bit of time"" Durbin said.

A team of international researchers including from India have found that the COVID-19 virus' contains a tiny chunk of DNA that matched the sequence patented by Moderna three years before the onset of the pandemic.

The findings published in Frontiers in Virology has raised new suspicion that the COVID-19 virus may have been tinkered within a lab Daily Mail reported.

The scientists' team including Akhil Varshney from Dr Shroff Charity Eye Hospital in New Delhi showed a tiny snippet of a genetic material owned by Moderna in the virus's spike protein.

But records show that Moderna had filed the patent in February 2016 as part of its cancer research division the report said.

In the study the team compared COVID-19's makeup to millions of sequenced proteins on an online database.

The virus is made up of 30000 letters of genetic code that carry the information it needs to spread known as nucleotides.

It is the only coronavirus of its type to carry 12 unique letters that allow its spike protein to be activated by a common enzyme called furin allowing it to spread between human cells with ease.

Analysis of the original COVID-19 genome found the virus shares a sequence of 19 specific letters with a genetic section owned by Moderna which has a total of 3300 nucleotides the report said.

The patented sequence is part of a gene called MSH3 that affects how damaged cells repair themselves in the body.

Scientists have highlighted this pathway as a potential target for new cancer treatments.

Twelve of the shared letters make up the structure of COVID-19's furin cleavage site with the rest being a match with nucleotides on a nearby part of the genome.

Advertisement The researchers suggest the virus may have mutated to have a furin cleavage site during experiments on human cells in a lab.

""The matching code may have originally been introduced to the COVID-19 genome through infected human cells expressing the MSH3 gene"" wrote Dr Balamurali Ambati from the University of Oregon in the study.

At the same time the team also claimed that there is a one-in-three-trillion chance Moderna's sequence randomly appeared through natural evolution.

""We're talking about a very very very small piece made up of 19 nucleotides"" Professor Lawrence Young a virologist at Warwick University was quoted as saying to Daily Mail.

""So it doesn't mean very much to be frank if you do these types of searches you can always find matches.

""Sometimes these things happen fortuitously sometimes it's the result of convergent evolution (when organisms evolve independently to have similar traits to adapt to their environment).

""It's a quirky observation but I wouldn't call it a smoking gun because it's too small.

""It doesn't get us any further with the debate about whether COVID-19 was engineered"" Young said.

A statement from the US drug maker Moderna is awaited the report said.

The vaccine dubbed Nuvaxovid is protein based — the first of its kind to be approved in Canada.

How does Novavax work compared to Pfizer or Moderna?

Compared to Pfizer and Moderna’s mRNA vaccines that use newer technology Nuvaxovid relies on a more traditional method of eliciting an immune response from the body.

Infection control and infectious disease physician Dr. Alon Vaisman explains that most vaccines are made out of some component of the virus or bacteria itself.

“For example if you were to get a meningococcal vaccine you’re getting a little piece of the cell wall of the bacteria. In this case we’re getting a little piece of the protein that the virus produces” he said.

In comparison the mRNA vaccines contain the genetic code for that protein. The body then makes the protein which in turn triggers the immune system to attack it as an unknown entity.

“[Nuvaxovid] goes one step beyond what the mRNA vaccine would do. Instead of using our own body’s machinery to create that protein this vaccine just gives it to us and shows our immune system the foreign antigen which is what we use to create our antibodies. So it says ‘here’s what it looks like produce the antibodies to this. Next time you see something like this … you should attack it” explains Vaisman.

Is Novavax better than Pfizer of Moderna?

Dr. Vaisman says it is a common misconception that the vaccine that took longer to develop and uses an older method may be more reliable.

“There isn’t a lot of validity to say that Novavax is a ‘traditional one’ so to speak and therefore we can rely on it more” he said.

He adds that many may have felt that the newer mRNA vaccines weren’t tested thoroughly enough or were somehow unsafe but that is not the case. They were first out the gate simply because the genetic sequence of the virus was determined very early on in the pandemic making it possible to develop a vaccine based on that information.

“All vaccines that are approved now in Canada have gone through rigorous testing and are all safe” Vaisman reiterated.

“If anything mRNA vaccines have a lot more experience than any vaccine we’ve ever dealt with. Hundreds of millions of people [have gotten] mRNA vaccines by now — that’s far more data we’ve had in such a short time than probably any vaccine we’ve ever had. The vaccines we’ve had for the last 50-60 years — lots of people have gotten those but it’s over a very long period of time. Here we have so much data piling up very quickly” he added.

Vaisman says the mechanism by which the vaccine works is also not an indicator of efficacy.

“There isn’t any specific reason why you might choose one for another except if you have some kind of personal preference. But in terms of how it works not necessarily” he said. “I think the overall question about which vaccine is right for people is not going to be based on preference. It is going be based on hard data.”

Vaisman cites the flu vaccine as an example saying that there are usually a variety of formulations of it. The one you get isn’t based on your preference but what the data shows about how well it works in various age groups.

“So we give a certain formulation to children to middle aged people and then to seniors because we know that certain formulations work better [for them]” he explained.

Clinical studies show that Nuvaxovid is 90 per cent effective against severe disease and 100 per cent effective against death from COVID-19.

“This vaccine looks really good. How it works in the real world will depend on how it works on the variants and when we see it rolled out in large numbers” he said.

Will Novavax be effective against COVID-19 variants?

Dr. Vaisman says it is too early to know whether Nuvaxovid will be as effective against new virus variants.

“We saw that with mRNA vaccines … as new variants developed its protection against symptomatic disease was reduced but it maintained a very high level protection against severe outcomes like death” he said.

With the current mRNA vaccines if the protein in the virus has not mutated drastically in a new variant additional doses of the same formulation afford additional protection.

It is unclear if new formulations of Nuvaxovid will be required to combat new variants.

“It will probably depend more on what we see in real world data” said Vaisman.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpaml0aW1lcy5jb20uZmovZW1hLWJhY2tzLXBmaXplci1jb3ZpZC1ib29zdGVyLWZvci10ZWVucy1tb2Rlcm5hLXNob3QtZm9yLWFnZXMtNi0xMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,EMA backs Pfizer COVID booster for teens Moderna shot for ages 6-11,"Feb 24 (Reuters) – The European Union’s health regulator on Thursday backed giving a booster shot of Pfizer (PFE.N) and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine to adolescents aged 12 and over as well as the expanded use of Moderna’s (MRNA.O) shot in children ages six to 11.

The recommendations by the European Medicine Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use will be followed by final decisions by the European Commission.

The moves come after several EU countries already started to offer booster doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to teens.

Germany’s vaccine committee in January recommended all children between the ages of 12 and 17 receive a booster following the initial two-shot course. Other nations in the region followed suit.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said in a report this month that 10 countries in the European Economic Area which comprises the 27 EU member states plus Liechtenstein Iceland and Norway had already recommended a booster dose for those under 18 years of age.

Member States’ decision on whether and when to offer boosters in this age group will need to take into account factors such as the spread and likely severity of the disease in younger persons and the known risk of side effects like the rare heart complication myocarditis the EMA said.

The agency on Thursday also recommended approval of Moderna’s COVID vaccine for use in children aged 6 to 11.

Moderna’s Spikevax COVID shot is already approved for use in adults and children aged 12 and over in Europe.

In the United States the Moderna vaccine is authorized as a primary two-dose regimen and booster dose for adults 18 years and older. The company has yet to win clearance for use in younger age groups. read more

The company will focus on growing its market share both organically and inorganically in the biscuits category where companies such as Parle and Britannia dominate. It will also expand the per capita consumption of its chocolates and bakery products driving sales across premium and low unit price segments.

India will play a “phenomenal"" role in Mondelez’s growth plans till 2030 the company’s top management said in a virtual roundtable with the media. “The India business has a strong plan to deliver sustained low double-digit growth till 2030 in this country"" Dirk Van de Put chairman and chief executive officer at the company said. “India is a business that is big and that is growing quite nicely for us"" he said.

In 2021 India contributed 19% to the company’s global revenues. The year also saw the company’s revenue here jump 21% to reach $ 1.2 billion. Its chocolates health foods and drinks and cookies reach over 3 million outlets in the country.

Van de Put outlined key areas of growth including expanding distribution extending the pipeline of premium and lower-priced products developing rural markets and bolstering the biscuits category.

“We believe that we can grow the chocolate category as well as our biscuit business. I think I’ve already alluded to a few ways that we would grow"" he said referring to distribution expansion reaching more stores and growing rural markets. “There’s also a number of areas such as gifting which we believe has a huge opportunity and where chocolate obviously can play a big role. The premium segment we think in chocolate will continue to evolve and we want to be big players in that"" Van de Put elaborated.

“In biscuits we have 2% market share which is small. So we’ve got a hell of a runway ahead of us"" Van de Put said.

The biscuits category with brands such as Cadbury Oreo and Bournvita contribute 12% to its business which is lower than the average of the AMEA region. Mondelez will continue to invest in and grow its Oreo Bournvita and Cadbury brands to expand its share in the biscuits category.

“Oreo is leading the way. It’s only 10 years in the market but it’s already $100 million in sales and growing very fast. Then of course we are using the Cadbury brand to also enter the biscuit segment through what we call choco-bakery products and cakes. We also are using Bournvita in some of the biscuit segments. So I think biscuits will become bigger and bigger for us"" he said.

Van de Put said the company wants to invest in infrastructure in India while also hinting at a possibility of an acquisition in the Indian market.

“It’s a market where we want to invest in infrastructure and also in acquisitions. We will certainly try to grow in the categories we represent; chocolates we are already doing very well. You can imagine that in biscuits or bakery products there could be a certain interest for us trying to increase our presence in India. D2C (direct-to-consumer) would need to grow a little bit more before we feel that it offers us enough critical mass"" he said.

The company draws a massive 72% of its India business from chocolate brands such as Cadbury Dairy Milk Cadbury 5Star and Perk while 14% of revenues come from powdered beverages such as Tang and Bournvita.

The operations in India known as Mondelez India Foods made Rs 8038 crore ($1.07 billion) or a modest 3.69 per cent of the total revenue. But make no mistake this market is hugely strategic for the company.

In a virtual media roundtable Mondelez International Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dirk Van de Put outlined the broad plan for India. ""The business has a strong plan to deliver sustained low double-digit growth till 2030"" he said. Here the company is synonymous with brands such as Cadbury Dairy Milk the biggest brand in the Mondelez portfolio; Bournvita the second largest in the overall malt-based drinks business; and has presence in biscuits through Oreo.

According to him India has a mix of brands from its global portfolio (Cadbury and Oreo) and also an extension of them into other categories -- cookies and chocobakes choc-layered cakes being some examples. ""We have brands uniquely local like Perk Bournvita 5 star and Gems"" he pointed out.

The Indian landscape is different from a retail point of view where it is overwhelmingly dominated by the traditional mom-and-pop stores or kirana as they are more popularly known. For Mondelez he said 80 per cent of its sales is done through this while 17 per cent from modern trade and a much smaller 3 per cent through digital. There are 3 million traditional stores that Mondelez reaches out and Van de Put said the company wants to double that number.

On digital he explained that globally it brings in 6 per cent of the business. ""In that context 3 per cent in India is not too bad"" he said.

By way of a background Cadbury globally sold the company to Kraft in early 2010. In October 2012 Kraft spun off the snack business to form Mondelez.

Van de Put who came aboard in late 2017 from McCain Foods replaced Irene Rosenfeld. While chocolates are the cash cow for the company in India he made it clear that biscuits are huge opportunity. ""We have a two per cent market share and our presence is now getting stronger with chocobakes choc-layered cakes"" he said. While Oreo is the big one the Bournvita franchise too has moved into biscuits. The dominant players in India's biscuit industry are Parle Britannia and ITC.

Responding to a query from Business Today on innovation Van de Put emphasised that it was a critical component of the company's story globally. ""For us we look at what proportion of product sales comes from new products over the last three years. That is around 10 per cent which is in line with or slightly above competition"" he said.

During the pandemic Mondelez International realised having too many SKUs (stock keeping units or a number assigned to a product for inventory management) was not a good idea. ""We then reduced that number with the objective of having a bigger impact on sales"" he elaborated. According to him innovation is not just about product formulation but also other areas such as ingredients packaging changes in the supply chain and in the business model too.

In India Van de Put said Mondelez launches about ten new products each year. ""It is a different market where limited number of SKUs are driven by big innovation"" he explained.

The innovation story in any market is broken up into what is done with the core brands and the other part being new forays.

Deepak Iyer President India Mondelez International opened up on innovation in Bournville where it was rich dark chocolate and Silk Mousse in the case of Cadbury Dairy Milk from the core part of it. ""Chocobakes choc layered Fuse Fit and Trisbix a savoury biscuit are examples of going into newer areas"" he added.

Here's Why,"Danny DeVito Is Calling For A Nabisco Boycott. Here's Why

Danny DeVito has weighed in on the Nabisco strike. ""Support Nabisco workers striking for humane working hours fair pay outsourcing jobs"" he wrote on Twitter. ""NO CONTRACTS. NO SNACKS.""

Nabisco is a subsidiary of Mondelez International which produces familiar snacks like Oreos Fig Newtons and Chips Ahoy! As Eater reports 200-plus workers at Nabisco's Portland-based bakery went on strike on August 10 over proposed contract changes that would eliminate the overtime accrued for weekend work or shifts longer than eight hours. Vice adds that health plan benefits were also slated to be reduced.

On Twitter support seems strong for the worker's strike and brand boycott. As of publication DeVito's Tweet has received 148000 likes and 35000 retweets. And DeVito's vocal support of Nabisco workers should come as no surprise. In 2016 The Guardian featured a picture of DeVito endorsing former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. In the 2020 Presidential Election cycle The Hill reported that DeVito's devotion for the liberal democratic politics of Sanders held firm.

However as Mondelez owns Nabisco the boycott might have to scale up to meet the level of the mega corporation. In an organizational chart shared by Jason Barnes on Twitter Mondelez is shown to also own the likes of Philadelphia Cream Cheese Toblerone and Tang.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZW56aW5nYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMi8wMi8yMjM1OTQ4OC93aGF0LWlzLW1jZG9uYWxkcy1jZW8tY2hyaXMta2VtcGN6aW5za2ktbmV0LXdvcnRoLWNlby1pbnRlcnZpZXctYnJlYWtzLWRvd24tY29tcGV0aXRpdmUtYWR2YW50YWdlc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Is McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski Net Worth?

Both countries' financial markets have unsurprisingly been thrown into turmoil by this week's events which rank as the biggest military attack in Europe since World War Two bringing stiff Western sanctions on Moscow.

S&P lowered Russia's long-term foreign currency credit rating to 'BB+' from 'BBB-' and warned it could lower ratings further after getting more clarity on the macroeconomic repercussions of the sanctions.

""In our view the sanctions announced to date could carry significant negative implications for the Russian banking sector's ability to act as a financial intermediary for international trade S&P said.

It also cut Ukraine's rating to 'B-' from 'B'.

Russia now has an ""investment grade"" rating of Baa3 from Moody's and an equivalent BBB- from Fitch due to one of the lowest debt levels in the world at just 20% of GDP and nearly $650 billion of currency reserves.

RUSSIA INVADES UKRAINE: LIVE UPDATES

A downgrade however would lower that rating to the riskier ""junk"" or sub-investment grade category.

""The decision to place the ratings on review for downgrade reflects the negative credit implications for Russia's credit profile from the additional and more severe sanctions being imposed"" Moody's said in a statement.

Sovereign rating reviews can take months but this time are likely to be quicker.

Moody's said its decision would factor in the scale of the conflict and the severity of additional Western sanctions which have already hit some of Russia's top banks military exports and members of President Vladimir Putin's inner circle.

It added it would also weigh the degree to which Russia's substantial currency reserves are able to mitigate the disruption stemming from the new sanctions and lengthy conflict.

""Moody's will look to conclude the review when these credit implications become more clear particularly when the impact of further sanctions takes shape in the coming days or weeks"" it said.

Moody's also put Ukraine's already-junk ""B3"" rating on review for a downgrade.

Fitch did not wait however and moved immediately to slash its Ukraine rating by a whole three notches to ""CCC"" from ""B.""

It explained ""There is a high likelihood of an extended period of political instability with regime change a likely objective of President Putin creating heightened policy uncertainty and potentially also undermining the willingness of Ukraine to repay debt.""

Moody's had also warned a heavy conflict could leave Kyiv struggling to make debt payments.

RUSSIA'S INVASION AFFECTS BILLIONS IN UKRAINE-CHINA TRADE

Scope a smaller European rating agency has estimated Ukrainian government debt could jump above 90% of GDP by 2024 from about 50% now while S&P Global also warned on Friday of a spate of downgrades as a result of the war.

The International Monetary Fund is exploring all options to aid Ukraine with further financial support said its head Kristalina Georgieva.

Russia's central bank has beefed up its banking sector with billions in additional foreign exchange and rouble liquidity while the government has separately pledged full-scale support to sanctions-hit companies.

It is not the first time Russia is being cut to junk. Moody’s and S&P both took similar steps in early 2015 after the annexation of Crimea and plunging oil prices caused a rouble currency crisis.

(Reporting by Marc Jones in London Mehr Bedi and Bhargav Acharya in Bengaluru; Editing by Sam Holmes and Clarence Fernandez)",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL2hlYXJ0bGFuZC5vcmcvcHVibGljYXRpb25zL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC1pbnN0aXR1dGlvbnMtYXJlLWV4cGFuZGluZy1lc2ctc29jaWFsLWNyZWRpdC1zY29yZXMtdG8tdGFyZ2V0LWluZGl2aWR1YWxzLXNtYWxsLWJ1c2luZXNzZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are Financial Institutions Using ESG Social Credit Scores to Coerce Individuals Small Businesses? – The Heartland ...,"Environmental social and governance (ESG) metrics are a kind of social credit system designed to coerce businesses—and by extension individuals and all of society—to transform their practices.

Through a carrot-and-stick approach investors and banks (and soon governments) use ESG to push businesses to change how they function regardless of what the employees and customers of those businesses want. In many cases however corporate executives are all too willing to go along because they want access to the cheap capital offered by investors and financial institutions.

The widespread adoption of ESG metrics which is also commonly called “stakeholder capitalism”—is meant to radically alter how businesses are evaluated expanding considerations beyond traditional economic metrics like profit revenue debt customer satisfaction and product development.

Instead of looking at economic and financial considerations ESG social credit metrics measure things like “Percentage of active workforce covered under collective bargaining agreements” (union labor) and “Percentage of employees per employee category by age group gender and other indicators of diversity (e.g. ethnicity).”

(To learn more about the basics of ESG read my ESG primer here or watch my recorded presentation for The Heartland Institute here.)

Unlike many corporations which spend substantial time and resources self-reporting ESG individual investors and most small businesses typically do not produce their own ESG reports. Instead large financial services companies and banks have produced them for these groups often without individuals or businesses asking for the reports.

For instance Merrill Lynch a division of Bank of America produces ESG scores for all or nearly all of its individual investment accounts even for those whose value is $1000 or less.

Moody’s has created an “ESG Score Predictor” that offers users with ESG reports for 100000 businesses many of which have never produced their own ESG metrics. Moody’s algorithm predicts scores by using “company size location and industry as inputs.”

When individuals and small businesses have raised concerns about the use of ESG and how it could be used against them—as opposed to merely being applied to corporations for the benefit of investors—banks investment groups and their lobbyists have claimed that concerns over ESG are nothing but “conspiracy theories.”

However the evidence shows that there are very good reasons to believe that financial institutions and banks plan to dramatically expand the use of ESG soon for individuals families and small businesses a move that would dramatically change the U.S. economy and society. Below are the five most important reasons for all Americans to be concerned.

1. There Are Already Many Examples of Individuals and Businesses Being Denied Access to Financial Services or Capital Based on Subjective Criteria

It’s impossible to know to what extent individuals organizations and businesses are now being denied access to financial services including loans based on subjective criteria because there are no databases nor reporting agencies tasked with compiling denials based on non-financial reasons. However news outlets have reported many examples of such actions and some industry reports openly admit that discrimination is common.

For example Deutsche Bank AG and Signature Bank announced in early 2021 that would no longer provide services to former President Donald Trump or his business the Trump Organization purely for ideological reasons.

In November 2021 WePay a J.P. Morgan Chase-owned payment processor informed the Missouri-based Defense of Liberty political action committee that it would stop offering its services to the organization after it planned an event featuring Donald Trump Jr. (Chase later reversed the decision but only after “Missouri treasurer Scott Fitzpatrick threatened to have the state stop doing business with the bank.”)

According to former North Dakota lawmaker Bette Grande “During the 2021 legislative session in North Dakota representatives of the lignite industry testified that coal operations are seeing increasing insurance premiums and a drop in the number of insurance companies willing to write insurance for any price. This is the ESG movement in action and it will not stop with oil and coal.”

Also in 2021 Sustainalytics an ESG business owned by Morningstar published a report titled How Sustainable Finance is Shaping Change in Banking. In the publication Sustainalytics notes:

Most major banks screen their lending portfolios against specific ESG risks as per the OECD Due Diligence guidance and many embrace negative or positive screening for potential corporate lending transactions or project finance transactions. Screening strategies filter potential transactions using predetermined ESG criteria to rule companies in or out of contention for financing. Negative screening and norm-based screening involve the exclusion or avoidance of transactions not aligned with environmental social and ethical standards. Exclusion criteria often include issues like weapon manufacturing tobacco sales or production of fossil fuels. While negative and norm-based screening are the most popular techniques used for ESG asset management these practices have been losing traction since 2015.

Positive screening on the other hand selects corporate borrowers that score highly on ESG factors relative to their peers. This can include best-in-class screening or the inclusion of investments in companies and sectors with higher ESG scores as compared to their peers or companies that are actively improving their ESG performance. This screening method does not necessarily exclude ESG laggards but rather focuses on those performing best with regards to ESG in relation to comparable companies or industries. In comparison to corporate lending transactions the intensity of screening is often higher for project finance transactions given due diligence requirements under the Equator Principles.

In 2020 Wells Fargo suspiciously closed a bank account belonging to Lauren Witzke a 2020 Republican candidate for the Delaware Senate.

The Heritage Foundation noted in a 2021 report that “PayPal has admitted to closing accounts flagged by the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2019 now PayPal has announced a partnership with the left-leaning Anti-Defamation League to focus on ‘further uncovering and disrupting the financial pipelines that support extremist and hate movements.'”

In 2019 the New York Post reported that J.P. Morgan Chase closed bank accounts associated with several political activists and commentators including Enrique Tarrio Joe Biggs Laura Loomer and Martina Markota—all within weeks of each other. According to the Post the activists said they were not given clear explanations for the cancellations.

In 2018 some large U.S. banks including Citibank rolled out restrictions for gun manufacturers and retailers. According to a report by the New York Times “They are restricting their credit card and banking services to gun retailers and halting lending to gun makers that do not comply with age limits and background check rules determined by the banks. They are also freezing out businesses that sell high-capacity magazines and ‘bump stocks’ attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire faster even though such products are legal under federal law.”

2. Credit Agencies Have Started to Alter Businesses’ Credit Ratings Based on ESG Scores

As noted in a 2021 sweeping report by Fitch Ratings—one of the “big three credit rating agencies” (along with Moody’s and S&P)—corporate credit rating agents already take ESG scores into account. And according to Fitch and others the use of ESG to alter credit ratings will almost certainly expand in the months and years to come.

If the largest agencies are willing to use ESG to alter corporate credit scores why wouldn’t credit agencies and banks do the same for individuals and small businesses?

3. Analysts Predict Individual Credit Scores Could Soon Have an ESG Component

Perhaps the most widely used service to check the creditworthiness of individuals and small business is FICO. When banks and credit unions examine applications for loans FICO is often the first place they turn. In an article published in December 2021 on FICO’s website titled “Lending Predictions 2022: From BNPL to ESG (and More)” a FICO senior principal consultant wrote that he believes in 2022 “The ESG Agenda Will Drive the Search for Cleaner Decisions.”

“In financial institutions much of the ESG agenda is delivered at the corporate level” the analyst wrote “but in 2022 we expect to see an increased focus on bringing ESG data into more granular lending and investment decisions. This will require increased innovation in the use of alternative data across all kinds of lending. One example would be the inclusion of property energy ratings data in mortgage valuation and decisioning and CO2 emission data for small businesses.”

He also noted “Over the longer term we expect that ESG and climate risk evaluations will become an integral element of credit risk and affordability assessments.”

This is a clear admission that ESG will likely soon be applied to individual and small business credit scores and/or other considerations such as mortgage applications.

4. Large Investment Management Firms and Banks Are Using ESG to Coerce Corporations

The primary stated purpose of ESG is to change corporations especially the largest and most powerful ones in order to produce more extensive societal impacts. This point is not in dispute. Everyone who understands ESG regardless of whether they support it or not agrees that it’s being used to alter corporate activities.

If you’re looking for specific examples of this however a good place to start is Larry Fink’s 2022 “Letter to CEOs” in which Fink sings the praises of “stakeholder capitalism” and promises to use ESG scores as a way to alter society. Fink is the head of Blackrock the world’s largest asset management company and is widely considered one of the most powerful people on Wall Street if not the most powerful person.

Of course Fink attempts to put a happy face on ESG and stakeholder capitalism throughout his letter but even he can’t help himself when discussing climate change making it clear that companies must choose between being leaders or being dragged into a net-zero economy against their will.

“Every company and every industry will be transformed by the transition to a net zero world” Fink wrote. “The question is will you lead or will you be led?”

The threats from Fink and others have largely worked. Accounting firm KPMG reports thousands of companies in dozens of countries have ESG systems in place including 82 percent of large companies in the United States. (And this data is now a couple of years old.)

If investors and banks are willing to utilize ESG to control corporations why wouldn’t they use ESG to manipulate individual and small business behavior as well?

5. Banks Have Promised to Use ESG to Fight Climate Change Throughout All of Their Portfolios and Business Activities

The largest and most influential banks and financial institutions in the United States much of Europe and Canada have openly said that they will use their tremendous amount of wealth to force the global economy to move to net-zero by at least 2050 and to halve CO2 emissions by 2030. This will be done in a variety of ways including by “accelerating decarbonization in the real economy by describing financial sector expectations of transition plans from the companies the sector engages with and finances.”

One of the largest groups of banks and financial institutions promising to make such an extreme acceleration is the Glasgow Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ). There are already “over 450 financial firms across 45 countries responsible for assets of over $130 trillion” in GFANZ including numerous large U.S. banks such as Bank of America J.P. Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo & Company.

There simply is no way for banks to keep their promises related to a transition to net-zero without imposing ESG metrics or other similar criteria on individuals and small businesses.

Vadim Zamirovsky/AP

Morgan Stanley Wealth Management CIO Lisa Shalett said the Russia-Ukraine conflict will keep markets in risk-off mode for weeks.

She said a rapidly-changing situation often results in a flight out of risk assets but this isn't a good strategy in the longer run.

Russia invaded Ukraine on Thursday in the region's largest military operation since World War 2.

Financial markets have been roiled this week after Russia invaded Ukraine following weeks of escalating tensions. Volatility has soared and investors are wondering what this means for their portfolios.

Russia assembled vast numbers of troops around Ukraine — as many as 190000 per US estimates — in the largest military operation in the region since World War II.

On Thursday Putin authorized a full-scale attack on Ukraine. In the hours that followed explosions pounded cities around Ukraine many hundreds of miles from the previous conflict zone. Ukrainian officials reported fighting on its borders with Russia and dozens of casualties.

Stock markets plunged then rallied then came under renewed pressure while oil hit $100 a barrel for the first time since late 2014 on the back of concern about the impact to global supply should major crude producer Russia be unable to move exports.

Morgan Stanley Wealth Management's chief investment officer Lisa Shalett believes that however the situation develops on the ground in Ukraine it won't be a matter of markets rapidly returning to business as usual following the initial shock.

""I think it's a big deal. And I think it's a risk off factor in the next few weeks"" she told Insider in an interview earlier in the week.

She said Morgan Stanley continues to be cautious towards markets.

""When there are exogenous crises around the world whether it's a war whether it's 911 whether it's a trade war or whether it's a political scandal whatever it is these things tend to make people want to reduce their exposure to the most risky assets"" Shalett said.

Since Putin said early on Thursday he had authorized military action investors have ditched riskier assets like stocks and crypto and flocked to the safety of gold government bonds and the dollar.

She said this is the typical playbook that gets deployed in this environment is investors selling high beta high growth stocks such as technology shares and buy defensive assets like gold and bonds. But simply responding to a rapidly-changing set of catalysts isn't a good long-term strategy.

""The situation in Russia-Ukraine is completely fast moving and fluid"" she said. ""People are de-risking portfolios. But that's not something that you can base a portfolio asset allocation or portfolio construction decision around.""

As the realities of a war in Ukraine sink in luxury brands and national apparel organisations are grappling with the likely impact of sanctions on the fashion industry.



As Italian fashion collections played out in Milan on Friday Carlo Capasa head of the Italian fashion federation Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana pointed out that Italian luxury goods exports to Russia amount to roughly €1.2 billion annually.



Unconfirmed rumours citing diplomatic sources suggested on Thursday that Italy’s Prime Minister Mario Draghi was pressuring the European Union to exclude Italian luxury goods from retaliative sanctions that will bar exports and certain financial transactions with Russia. A spokesman for Mario Draghi told Vogue Business on Saturday that Italy has made no requests for carve-outs on sanctions. The office tweeted: “Italy’s position is fully aligned with the rest of the EU. #Ukraine.”

Capasa said in a brief interview before the Jil Sander show on Saturday afternoon that the Camera was not pressuring leaders to exclude luxury goods from sanctions packages. “We trust completely our government and what they are doing with Macron in France. Whatever they decide we are with them.”

Read More Ukrainian designer Ruslan Baginskiy: “You need to act. Immediately” World-renowned milliner Ruslan Baginskiy employs over 80 people in Kyiv. He asks the fashion community to focus on Ukraine instead of fashion week.

The EU Commission is still formalising the next round of sanctions against the world’s 11th-largest economy which are rumoured to include SWIFT international payment systems something that would also hit luxury’s ability to sell and trade with Russia. The EU commission did not respond to requests for comment. France’s economy and finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Comité Colbert the French luxury goods trade association declined to comment.



On Thursday Richemont decided to temporarily close all its stores in Russia but reopened them on Saturday according to sources inside Richemont. The French luxury conglomerate declined to comment. In Ukraine Richemont has one Cartier store and two stores with franchises (Van Cleef & Arpels and Montblanc) which are closed.



Sentiments to exclude luxury in sanctions on Russia were not vocally supported in Italy’s fashion industry nor by some other nations and national apparel groups.



“We are NOT lobbying to exclude” said Alexander Gibson spokesman for the American Apparel and Footwear Association in Washington DC by email. “Sanctions include all products including apparel and footwear … Our focus has been on supporting the Biden Administration’s efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution of this crisis as quickly as possible.”



Earlier the organisation issued a statement on Ukraine stating “It is a terrible week for the citizens of Europe and indeed the globe. The political instability and strife we are seeing boil over is incredibly upsetting. We are praying for peace and the people of Ukraine.”



There will be an impact on operations in Europe and the region the statement said. “We are working closely with our members to track the evolving situation including effects this will have on supply chains other global economic factors and the imposition of sanctions. Our industry goes to great lengths to support workers and supply chain partners in the face of such disruption and to ensure that their operations remain fully compliant with all existing and any new sanctions and requirements.”



Hours after Missoni’s Fall 2022 collection hit the runway Angela Missoni the company’s president and former creative director noted that the industry – and all Italian industries – will be hit hard by rising natural gas prices because much of the country’s supplies come from Ukraine and are used to generate the electricity on which apparel and accessory factories run.



Despite those costs and the potential loss of sales to Russia she said “I think you have to take a stand. …I would never be on the side of a war. I will always be on the side of the people of the land who are being attacked.”



“We have to give a sign that we are against the politics” Missoni continued “Even if it’s a sacrifice for Italy.”



After the Gucci show on Friday afternoon creative director Alessandro Michele confided that he was unable to eat dinner the night before after seeing news of Russia’s invasion.



“I felt so bad. I think we have to love more against the people who hate life” said Michele — who is known for his gentle poetic outlook on design — in non-native English. “I want to scream to everybody — we need life!”



Morgan Stanley estimates that Russia nationals account for less than 2 per cent of Kering and Richemont worldwide sales including Russian spending abroad. “The importance of Russia and Russian nationals for the luxury goods sector has gone down over the years and is now relatively immaterial” Morgan Stanley analyst Édouard Aubin says. “Counterintuitively the less homogeneous a society is (as measured by ratio such as the Gini index) the lower total luxury spend will be and vice versa.” The analyst notes that South Korea is a very homogeneous society and spend per capita is far greater than in Russia accounting for 5 to 6 per cent of total personal luxury goods spending worldwide for example. “Worldwide the growth of the luxury goods industry is now driven by the middle to upper middle class.”



Inter Parfums CEO Philippe Benacin told Vogue Business that Russia represents 5 per cent of the turnover of the company. He assumes that being an American company US sanctions would apply. It’s also unclear that if Russia is cut off from the SWIFT system any payment could be made he says.

Bitcoin has created a new form of wealth particularly for those who purchased bitcoin at its lowest value. Bitcoin is being used in over 270000 transactions daily and its usage is only increasing.

So why not use your Bitcoin to make your real estate transactions? This guide will explain everything you need to know about property transactions involving bitcoin.

How To Make Your Real Estate Transactions Using Bitcoin

Finding Real Estate Agents That Use Bitcoin

When using bitcoin to make your real estate transactions you must be aware of real estate agents and companies that have experience of using bitcoin in the sale or purchase of a home.

Some real estate agents that have experience using bitcoin include:

Magnum Real Estate Group - This is a New York-based real estate company adapted to the younger generation’s desire to make business transactions using bitcoin possible.

Kuper Sotheby’s International Realty - This Texas-based real estate company was the first in Texas to make a real estate transaction using Bitcoin.

Sand Key Realty - This real estate company is Florida-based and has a history of listing properties for sale with the seller accepting bitcoin as the form of payment.

Open Listings - sites like Open Listings are making it easier to purchase homes using bitcoin with options to limit search results to houses being sold for bitcoin.

The future of real estate is changing to accommodate the use of bitcoin in property transactions and more real estate companies are facilitating bitcoin transactions. In fact bitcoin is becoming as popular an investment as real estate.

Using Bitcoin To Purchase A Property

If you plan to use bitcoin to purchase a property you must first inquire whether the seller is accepting bitcoin. If the seller does not accept bitcoin you must convert your cryptocurrency into traditional currency using a third-party website.

If the seller accepts bitcoin you must negotiate the sale price in bitcoin.

You may only use bitcoin to purchase a property if you do not need to obtain a mortgage for the property like a cash buyer. This is because banks are hesitant to accept bitcoin partly because of its associations with money laundering and it is an unstable currency.

Once the sale has been negotiated you must also figure out the method of payment if your real estate agent fees can’t be paid using the currency.

Using Bitcoin To Sell A Property

If you wish to sell your property in exchange for bitcoin you must first find a real estate company that has experience using bitcoin to make real estate transactions (see the list above for guidance).

When listing your property you must determine whether you are listing it only for bitcoin buyers or if you are willing to accept other cryptocurrencies or traditional currency. Once it is listed buyers will make offers in your preferred currency and you can accept the offer and sell your home for Bitcoin.

Buying A Home With Bitcoin: The Benefits And Disadvantages

There are many advantages to purchasing a home using bitcoin including:

If you have made a profit from investing in bitcoin buying property using the currency is a great way to consolidate your profits.

Investing in property gives you a chance to diversify your assets.

Real estate transactions favor cash buyers and using bitcoin is like being a cash buyer which can give you more negotiating power

However there are also some disadvantages to buying a home with bitcoin including:

One of the drawbacks of purchasing a property using bitcoin is the lack of sellers. There is limited availability of properties being sold for bitcoin and you may have a hard time finding properties in your desired location.

If you decide to invest in property you may miss out on future appreciation and returns on your bitcoin.

You will need to enlist the help of a tax expert as making real estate transactions can be pretty complex in terms of taxes.

Selling A Home With Bitcoin: The Benefits And Disadvantages

Some of the advantages of selling a home using bitcoin include:

The chance of appreciation offered by owning bitcoin.

If you open up the sale of your home to bitcoin buyers you will widen your audience and attract more cash buyers.

Some of the disadvantages of selling a home using bitcoin include:

The chances of appreciation are equally weighed with the possibilities of bitcoin’s value depreciating resulting in losses.

The complexity of taxes involved in bitcoin real estate transactions applies to both the seller and the buyer.

You will also need to establish a secure virtual wallet for your new bitcoin which may involve enlisting help depending on how well-versed you are in cryptocurrency storage.

Summary

Like many other transactions real estate transactions are starting to accommodate the use of bitcoin to buy and sell houses. Since bitcoin is an emerging currency there are limits to the sellers buyers and real estate companies willing to deal in bitcoin.

However selling with bitcoin is indeed possible and grants sellers the opportunity for gains with bitcoin. Buying with bitcoin also offers buyers the chance to consolidate their profits and diversify their investment portfolio.

The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq Inc.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvZ3Jvd3RoLWludmVzdG9ycy1pbmR1c3RyeS1hbmFseXN0cy1qdXN0LTExMTQyNzM5My5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Growth Investors: Industry Analysts Just Upgraded Their Codexis Inc. (NASDAQ:CDXS) Revenue Forecasts By 16%,"Codexis Inc. (NASDAQ:CDXS) shareholders will have a reason to smile today with the analysts making substantial upgrades to this year's forecasts. The analysts have sharply increased their revenue numbers with a view that Codexis will make substantially more sales than they'd previously expected. Investor sentiment seems to be improving too with the share price up 9.0% to US$20.05 over the past 7 days. Could this big upgrade push the stock even higher?

After this upgrade Codexis' seven analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$142m in 2022. This would be a sizeable 36% improvement in sales compared to the last 12 months. Losses are supposed to balloon 46% to US$0.48 per share. Yet before this consensus update the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$123m and losses of US$0.52 per share in 2022. So there's been quite a change-up of views after the recent consensus updates with the analysts making a sizeable increase to their revenue forecasts while also reducing the estimated loss as the business grows towards breakeven.

See our latest analysis for Codexis

Taking a look at the bigger picture now one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. The analysts are definitely expecting Codexis' growth to accelerate with the forecast 36% annualised growth to the end of 2022 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 15% per annum over the past five years. By contrast our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to grow their revenue at 7.9% per year. It seems obvious that while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past the analysts also expect Codexis to grow faster than the wider industry.

The Bottom Line

The most important thing here is that analysts reduced their loss per share estimates for this year reflecting increased optimism around Codexis' prospects. They also upgraded their revenue estimates for this year and sales are expected to grow faster than the wider market. Given that analysts appear to be expecting substantial improvement in the sales pipeline now could be the right time to take another look at Codexis.

Even so the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for the value creation of shareholders. We have estimates - from multiple Codexis analysts - going out to 2024 and you can see them free on our platform here.

Another way to search for interesting companies that could be reaching an inflection point is to track whether management are buying or selling with our free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.

(NASDAQ:CARG) Revenue Forecasts,"CarGurus Inc. (NASDAQ:CARG) shareholders will have a reason to smile today with the analysts making substantial upgrades to this year's forecasts. The consensus estimated revenue numbers rose with their view now clearly much more bullish on the company's business prospects. CarGurus has also found favour with investors with the stock up an incredible 35% to US$46.44 over the past week. Could this upgrade be enough to drive the stock even higher?

After the upgrade the 13 analysts covering CarGurus are now predicting revenues of US$1.6b in 2022. If met this would reflect a sizeable 64% improvement in sales compared to the last 12 months. Losses are expected to turn into profits real soon with the analysts forecasting US$0.95 in per-share earnings. Before this latest update the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$1.3b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.89 in 2022. The forecasts seem more optimistic now with a nice gain to revenue and a modest lift to earnings per share estimates.

Check out our latest analysis for CarGurus

Despite these upgrades the analysts have not made any major changes to their price target of US$44.62 suggesting that the higher estimates are not likely to have a long term impact on what the stock is worth. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. The most optimistic CarGurus analyst has a price target of US$63.00 per share while the most pessimistic values it at US$35.00. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business.

Looking at the bigger picture now one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. The analysts are definitely expecting CarGurus' growth to accelerate with the forecast 64% annualised growth to the end of 2022 ranking favourably alongside historical growth of 23% per annum over the past five years. Compare this with other companies in the same industry which are forecast to grow their revenue 13% annually. It seems obvious that while the growth outlook is brighter than the recent past the analysts also expect CarGurus to grow faster than the wider industry.

Story continues

The Bottom Line

The biggest takeaway for us from these new estimates is that analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates with improved earnings power expected for this year. Fortunately analysts also upgraded their revenue estimates and our data indicates sales are expected to perform better than the wider market. Given that analysts appear to be expecting substantial improvement in the sales pipeline now could be the right time to take another look at CarGurus.

With that said the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have estimates - from multiple CarGurus analysts - going out to 2024 and you can see them free on our platform here.

The miniseries created by Shonda Rhimes told the story of Anna Sorokin — who went by the name Anna Delvey — who allegedly lied her way onto the New York social scene and scammed banks hotels and friends in the process. Netflix reportedly paid Sorokin $320000 for the rights to adapt her story which premiered this month  so how did the socialite spend the money?

Inventing Anna shows the ritzy life of Anna Sorokin through her 2017 arrest and trial. Julia Garner (of Ozark fame) plays the fake German heiress who was sentenced to four to twelve years in prison after being found guilty on six of eight charges of larceny and other crimes. While netting $320000 from Netflix she apparently used the money to pay off her debts according to Insider .

Anna Sorokin used $199000 to pay restitution to the banks $24000 to settle New York state fines and more than $75000 in attorney fees Insider reports leaving not very much of that Netflix money at all. The state of New York had frozen her funds in May 2019 under the “Son of Sam” law that prevents criminals from profiting from their crimes. However a judge ordered her accounts unfrozen ahead of her February 2021 release from prison so that she could pay off her victims.

While Anna Sorokin maintained that she didn’t steal from anyone her appeals attorney Audrey A. Thomas said Sorokin still believed she owed the money. According to Thomas:

She said 'You know I want them to be paid. I didn't steal the money but I do owe money so I'm not going to fight it. That's not who I am.'

Anna Sorokin was released from prison in February 2021 but arrested again just six weeks later for overstaying her visa. She remains in ICE custody as she waits to learn if she'll be deported to Germany.

The Netflix series was inspired by a New York Magazine article “How Anna Delvey Tricked New York’s Party People” written by Jessica Pressler and published in 2018. In Inventing Anna Anna Chlumsky plays Vivian Kent a journalist based on Pressler who becomes involved (probably too involved) with Julia Garner’s fake heiress.

Along with Anna Chlumsky and two-time Emmy Award winner Julia Garner the true crime series stars Laverne Cox Katie Lowes and Alexis Floyd as Anna Delvey’s friend group based on her real-life friends Kacy Rachel and Neff respectively. Lowes (Scandal) was one of several frequent Shonda Rhimes players to appear in the Netflix series which also featured Jeff Perry (Grey’s Anatomy Scandal) Kate Burton (Grey’s Anatomy Scandal) and Joshua Malina (Scandal).

This follows Australian public broadcaster SBS’s decision last week to suspend NTV Moscow and RT from airing their bulletins on its channels.

RT will no longer be accessible on YouTube in Ukraine either following a governmental request to suspend broadcasting of RT and several other channels in the beleaguered nation. Deadline previously reported YouTube’s confirmation it is cutting add ad revenue in all regions for RT and “several other channels affiliated with recent sanctions.”

RT continues to air in the UK although the media regulator Ofcom is monitoring the channel for any breaches of the broadcasting code. The UK’s opposition Labour Party has called for a complete ban on the channel which it accuses of being a “Russian propaganda tool.”

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ordered a review of the channel’s UK license although he stressed in Parliament this week that it should be up to the regulator and not politicians to make the decision on whether or not RT should be allowed to continue to air.

Story by Sgt 1st. Class. Angela Holtby III Corps Public Affairs



FORT HOOD Texas – After more than 33 years in service former III Armored Corps Command Sergeant Major Michael A. Crosby retired in a ceremony here in front of friends family and leaders February 25 at the corps headquarters.



Crosby spent a number of years in the III Armored Corps as a command sergeant major serving as such for the 4th Infantry Division and Fort Carson. He was also the command sergeant major of the 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team 1st Cavalry Division.



In 2018 he relinquished responsibility from the III Armored Corps to help stand up Army Futures Command in Austin TX as the first command sergeant major.



“I never asked the Army for any specific job or location I took what was given and I moved out and I executed” said Crosby “I would not change anything because I liked the opportunities that I had.""



Presiding over the ceremony and giving remarks was retired Gen. Mike Murray who was the commander of Army Futures Command and served alongside Crosby.



“AFC would not be where it is today without Command Sgt. Maj. Crosby” Murray said. “I am honored to have the opportunity to meet and get to know one of the very best Soldiers that I have had the honor of serving with in over my 35 years of service.”



Crosby from Alabama regaled the crowd with many stories of his time in service while noting that it was the first time in 33 years 5 months and 21 days of his military career to have all his family in one location to share this event. His wife Jill Crosby is a sergeant major and they have two daughters serving in the Army.



“The legacy I leave behind” Crosby said “is simply about the people and nothing but the people. I strived to instill a sense of dignity and respect and that is where I spent the majority of my time.”



Murray presented Crosby with the Army Distinguished Service Medal a certificate of retirement certificate of appreciation from the president of the U.S. and the U.S. flag. The event concluded as the 1st Cavalry Division Band played the Army Song.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9iYXlhcmVhL2FydGljbGUvSG93LW9uZS1TaWxpY29uLVZhbGxleS1zdGFydHVwLXJ1bnMtb24tdGhlLWxhYm9yLTE2OTQ1NTE2LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,They weren't paid.

The journalist and broadcaster was speaking to Sky News Australia on a visit to the country to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the channel attending a party at the Sydney Opera House.

And he told News Corp publications “I’ll be calling out extremists from all sides not just in Australia but anywhere – and especially those who think cancel culture’s a great idea and want to compel us all to lead their own dreary joyless lifestyles.”

Morgan’s new daily talkshow will be aired on Sky News Australia as well as on the UK’s brand new TalkTV station and on Fox Nation in the US.

This international TV coverage recognises Morgan’s pulling power since his return from the US in 2014 following his firing from CNN. It is one arm of an extraordinary deal he has signed with his former boss Rupert Murdoch said to be worth £50million ($67m) which includes regular columns in the UK tabloid newspaper The Sun the New York Post in the US and a book with Murdoch’s publishing house Harper Collins.

At the time the deal was announced Morgan said in statement that he wants his show to be “a fearless forum for lively debate and agenda-setting interviews and a place that celebrates the right for everyone to have an opinion.”

And Murdoch called Morgan “the broadcaster every channel wants but is too afraid to hire.”

Despite the high price he’s paid for Morgan’s services Murdoch clearly thinks he’s lucked out on the deal following the TV host’s success at ITV’s breakfast show Good Morning Britain. Initially hired on a part-time basis by the UK’s biggest rival to the BBC Morgan’s firebrand presence saw ratings go up and he was praised for his efforts in holding government leaders to account during the COVID-19 epidemic.

However his success there came to an abrupt end in March 2021 following the airing of Oprah Winfrey’s interview with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. The former newspaper editor stormed off the set and later quit the show after facing criticism for comments he made about the Duchess.

His remarks that he didn’t believe her statements about her suicidal thoughts led to 58000 viewers a record number complaining to the UK’s TV governing body OFCOM. While the broadcaster ITV was cleared of breaching broadcasting regulations OFCOM criticised Morgan deeming his comments to be harmful and offensive but robustly challenged by his co-presenters.

After appearing on Channel Nine’s breakfast show in Australia Morgan obliquely referenced his GMB departure tweeting “Great to be back on breakfast TV again.. even if I did have to fly 10000 miles to find a morning show that would let me express my opinions!”

Morgan’s slot on Sky News Australia will see him inherit the seat of shock jock Alan Jones who was dumped from the channel last year after a dip in audience figures.

TalkTV in the UK will broadcast every weekday evening with debate shows and news bulletins planned alongside Morgan’s big-ticket show. It will be streamed live in the UK and made widely available on all platforms including linear TV and OTT.",https://news.google.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_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Creepy crawlies’: shock new diet for your pet,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/home/pets/pet-care-tips-cockroaches-fly-larvae-and-crickets-pet-food-goes-vegan-via-insect-protein-food-and-treats/news-story/b5b6823b838ccd5244d2283b9a488d14 on URL https://news.google.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_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The journalist and broadcaster was speaking to Sky News Australia on a visit to the country to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the channel attending a party at the Sydney Opera House.

And he told News Corp publications “I’ll be calling out extremists from all sides not just in Australia but anywhere – and especially those who think cancel culture’s a great idea and want to compel us all to lead their own dreary joyless lifestyles.”

Morgan’s new daily talkshow will be aired on Sky News Australia as well as on the UK’s brand new TalkTV station and on Fox Nation in the US.

This international TV coverage recognises Morgan’s pulling power since his return from the US in 2014 following his firing from CNN. It is one arm of an extraordinary deal he has signed with his former boss Rupert Murdoch said to be worth £50million ($67m) which includes regular columns in the UK tabloid newspaper The Sun the New York Post in the US and a book with Murdoch’s publishing house Harper Collins.

At the time the deal was announced Morgan said in statement that he wants his show to be “a fearless forum for lively debate and agenda-setting interviews and a place that celebrates the right for everyone to have an opinion.”

And Murdoch called Morgan “the broadcaster every channel wants but is too afraid to hire.”

Despite the high price he’s paid for Morgan’s services Murdoch clearly thinks he’s lucked out on the deal following the TV host’s success at ITV’s breakfast show Good Morning Britain. Initially hired on a part-time basis by the UK’s biggest rival to the BBC Morgan’s firebrand presence saw ratings go up and he was praised for his efforts in holding government leaders to account during the COVID-19 epidemic.

However his success there came to an abrupt end in March 2021 following the airing of Oprah Winfrey’s interview with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. The former newspaper editor stormed off the set and later quit the show after facing criticism for comments he made about the Duchess.

His remarks that he didn’t believe her statements about her suicidal thoughts led to 58000 viewers a record number complaining to the UK’s TV governing body OFCOM. While the broadcaster ITV was cleared of breaching broadcasting regulations OFCOM criticised Morgan deeming his comments to be harmful and offensive but robustly challenged by his co-presenters.

After appearing on Channel Nine’s breakfast show in Australia Morgan obliquely referenced his GMB departure tweeting “Great to be back on breakfast TV again.. even if I did have to fly 10000 miles to find a morning show that would let me express my opinions!”

Morgan’s slot on Sky News Australia will see him inherit the seat of shock jock Alan Jones who was dumped from the channel last year after a dip in audience figures.

TalkTV in the UK will broadcast every weekday evening with debate shows and news bulletins planned alongside Morgan’s big-ticket show. It will be streamed live in the UK and made widely available on all platforms including linear TV and OTT.",https://news.google.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_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Creepy crawlies’: shock new diet for your pet,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/lifestyle/home/pets/pet-care-tips-cockroaches-fly-larvae-and-crickets-pet-food-goes-vegan-via-insect-protein-food-and-treats/news-story/b5b6823b838ccd5244d2283b9a488d14 on URL https://news.google.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_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Stock market corrections can be challenging for investors. The uncertainty makes it tough to know if your stocks will make it through. That's why it's a good idea to make sure you own companies built to endure tough times.

We asked some of our contributors for their favorite stocks to own when times gets tough. Here's why they believe Dominion Energy (D 0.02%) Nucor (NUE -1.67%) and NextEra Energy (NEE 1.58%) are great to hold and even add to when the stock market gets turbulent.

Boring on purpose

Reuben Gregg Brewer (Dominion Energy): Once many years ago Dominion Energy was a widely diversified energy company with oil drilling assets a midstream business and a utility all under one roof. In an effort to simplify its business and minimize risk it has pared its portfolio down to just utilities. This is a regulated business in which Dominion has to justify its rates to regulators and in exchange is granted a monopoly in the areas where it operates.

That makes Dominion a very reliable business given that electricity is basically one of the most important things supporting modern life. Sure demand tends to fall in times of economic weakness but not that much. It is a boring safe stock now that its multiyear transformation has been completed.

But what do investors get now? For starters a fairly generous dividend yield of 3.3% or so. Although the dividend was cut in 2020 that was because of the sale of its midstream business to Berkshire Hathaway.

That sale allowed Dominion to solidify its balance sheet and set it up for more-reliable and robust dividend growth. The goal is to increase the dividend at an annual rate of 6% through 2025 backed by capital investment totaling around $32 billion. Because of the importance of electricity and the regulated nature of the utility sector that spending or at least most of it will take place even if there's a bear market or a recession.

So you can focus on the dividends you are collecting instead of the market turbulence. And if Dominion's shares take a hit too you might even consider bulking up your position so you can collect even more of the growing dividend from what is now a utility-focused business.

Any drop in this stock's price is an opportunity

Neha Chamaria (Nucor): Nucor is the kind of stock that could take a big hit during a market downturn but it's also one stock you'd not only want to hold throughout but even buy while it's still cheap.

I'll give you two reasons: Nucor is one of the most well run and established players in an industry vital to the economy so its stock price is also likely to bottom out quickly once the market bounces back. And in between Nucor should help you earn passive income in the form of a regular dividend which now yields about 1.7%.

In fact Nucor doesn't just pay a regular dividend but is a Dividend Aristocrat that has increased its dividend every year for the last 49 years (leaving it one year away from Dividend King status). Last December Nucor increased its dividend by a solid 23% as the company's profits and cash flows expanded -- 2021 was a record year for Nucor.

With spending on infrastructure on the rise under the Biden administration demand for Nucor's steel products should remain strong. The company is already looking forward to a strong year and there's no reason it won't be able to increase its dividend yet again this year. Given the backdrop you'd want to consider any drop in Nucor's stock price in a market downturn as an opportunity to own a rock-solid infrastructure stock.

A safe haven when the market gets shaky

Matt DiLallo (NextEra Energy): NextEra Energy has one of the lowest-risk business models around. Its Florida-based electric utility generates relatively stable earnings by distributing energy to end-users under government-regulated rates. Meanwhile its clean-energy infrastructure business produces steady cash flow by selling power to other utilities and large electricity consumers secured by long-term fixed-rate contracts.

Adding to NextEra Energy's overall stability is its financial profile. It has a conservative dividend payout ratio for a utility and has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector. That gives it the financial flexibility to continue expanding its operations in Florida and its renewable energy business.

The company already has enough expansion-related investments to grow its earnings per share by 10% this year. Meanwhile it sees earnings growth coming in at or near the upper end of its long-term target range of 6% to 8% annually through 2025. Powering that growth is the company's rising backlog of renewable energy development projects and investments to enhance its utility in Florida. This forecast supports the company's belief that it can increase its dividend by around a 10% annual rate through 2024.

Given the company's steady growth NextEra is a great stock to hold when the market starts to nose-dive. While its share price might take a hit (which would be a good time to add shares) its earnings should continue heading higher even if the economy goes into recession. Add in its rock-solid 2%-plus dividend yield and it's a safe haven amid the market's storm.",,,,,,,,,

The 2022 Doernbecher Freestyle collection will become available to the general public later this spring and will feature an array of classic and contemporary Nike shoes and apparel designed by the youngsters with inspiration from their medical conditions such as Von Hippel-Lindau disease spina bifida sickle cell anemia and other hurdles these kids have been forced to tackle with bravery at such a young age according to an OHSU press release.

In the photos provided below get a look at each patient-designer’s signature shoe from this year’s Doernbecher Freestyle unveiling and how their health journeys helped inspire their designs.

Ayman Wamala | Age: 13 | Hometown: Salem Oregon

Nike Blazer Mid ‘77

Born in Kenya Ayman was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia at an early age and began treatment at OHSU Doernbecher Children’s Hospital four years ago after his family moved to Portland. An avid soccer player who also plans to pursue a career in acting Ayman also enjoys cooking and spending time learning about the woods and honing his own outdoor survival skills.

As part of this year’s collection Ayman is put his own personal touch on a classic Nike silhouette the Blazer Mid ‘77. The design incorporates Ayman’s self-described mysterious alter-ego a mind-reading character featured on the tongue of the shoe. Subtle tiger stripes on the midsole also hold a secret: they glow bright blue in UV light.

The words “Hope” “Strength” and “Perseverance” that surround Ayman’s logo on the shoe help to inspire those who wear them.

Catalina Vazquez | Age: 16 | Hometown: Kelso Washington

Nike SB Zoom Stefan Janoski

Catalina’s decision to use this wild turquoise green color for her 2022 Nike Zoom Stefan Janoski shoes was inspired by her fondness for the Galapagos Islands a place rich in discovery. The midsole features her own hand-drawn flowers that reflect her love of nature and the butterfly graphic on top embodies the changes Catalina has experienced in her life especially after being diagnosed with Von Hippel-Lindau disease.

Von Hippel-Lindau is a very rare hereditary condition that causes tumors to grow in multiple organs throughout the body. In Catalina’s case they have affected her eyes spinal cord and brain requiring five surgeries to remove them.

Catalina is determined to let each operation serve as an opportunity to emerge stronger than before. That also helps motivate her to bring awareness to her disease as she forges a path ahead.

Cidni O’Brien | Age: 16 | Hometown: Lebanon Oregon

Nike Air Force 1 Fontanka

Cidni was diagnosed with anomalous aortic origin of the left coronary artery in 2018. This means that a crucial artery that directs blood to her heart isn’t getting the job done. While the issue was thankfully identified it also meant that Cidni faced the prospect of a major heart surgery at just 16.

But just six months after her operation Cidni was back on the pitch with the Lebanon High School soccer team. Now Cidni gets to debut her inspiring story told through these Air Force 1 Fontanka shoes which pay tribute to her supportive teammates and family and the animals in her life that have kept her outlook positive.

On these shoes you will find tributes to Cidni’s horse Tank her mother Nikki and one of her favorite foods adorning the outsole: shrimp pasta. But that’s just a few of the many secret tributes you’ll find woven into her fresh pair of kicks. You’ll have to hunt for the others.

Maylee Phelps | Age: 15 | Hometown: Portland Oregon

Nike Court Zoom Vapor Cage 4

Maylee Phelps was born with spina bifida a condition where the spine and spinal cord fails to develop properly. Despite being confined to a wheelchair it hasn’t slowed her athletic aspirations. Maylee currently sits at No. 11 in the junior wheelchair tennis player rankings and aspires to represent the United States at the Los Angeles Paralympics in 2028. To get here Maylee has had to endure several surgeries at OHSU Doernbecher over the years to improve her mobility but that hasn’t stopped her training nor has it quelled her drive to improve.

Maylee’s shoe the Nike Air Zoom Vapor Cage 4 features a slew of personal touches including hand-drawn stars and a bright multicolor marbled outsole that incorporates all of her favorite colors. The tongue of the shoe features a spine graphic and a blue spina bifida awareness ribbon adorns the heel.

Michael Wilson | Age: 11 | Hometown: Dayton Oregon

Air Jordan 5 Retro Low

Michael didn’t even have two months in this world before facing his first major obstacle in life when he was diagnosed with Krabbe disease a rare genetic condition that destroys the protective coating of nerve cells in the brain and nervous system. While this disease is often fatal Michael and his family were able to get a diagnosis early enough that it qualified him for a life-saving stem-cell cord blood transplant performed at OHSU Doernbecher. It was a resounding success.

Now a decade removed from the procedure Michael is enjoying life as an 11-year-old who loves - among other things - airplanes sharks and mac and cheese all of which are factored into the design of his Air Jordan 5 Retro Low.

One of the most attractive features of the shoe will surely be the collection of unique patches that can be swapped on or off the tongue of the shoe to let you customize it according to your own style.

Sam David Phelps | Age: 14 | Hometown: Portland Oregon

LeBron XIX (19)

Much like his sister profiled above Sam David Phelps doesn’t let his condition get in the way of his athletic achievements especially where he stars: on the basketball court. Also like his sister Sam was born with spina bifida. While his goal in the future is to play for the USA men’s wheelchair basketball national team he’s currently honing his craft at home where he plays for the the Portland WheelBlazers.

It’s fitting that Sam gets to design his own version of LeBron James’ signature shoe the Lebron 19 for this year’s Freestyle collection being that James is his favorite athlete. Sam took an opulent approach to the design of this shoe some might even say it’s a design fit for “king” with metallic gold panels lightning bolts and an homage to his condition with a sporty wheelchair logo.

Zoe Taaffe | Age: 17 | Hometown: Tualatin Oregon

Nike Dunk Low

It’s no doubt that Zoe Taaffe is a Ducks fan.

Zoe’s love for the University of Oregon is quite apparent in the design of her shoe the Nike Dunk low. That isn’t the only part of her personality featured on the shoe however. Upon a closer look at the shoe you can find Zoe’s name hidden among zebra-like print on the midsole. The outsole is made of glow-in-the-dark material and an Oregon Duck-inspired nursing logo on the liner pays tribute to her dreams of one day becoming a nurse.

Much like her shoe Zoe’s disease is rare. So rare in fact that when she was diagnosed with Granulomatosis with polyangiitis during her sophomore year in high school she became one out of only 1.2 million pediatric patients to have it. This autoimmune disease causes severe inflammation of the blood vessels and her care at OHSU Doernbecher required multiple blood and plasma transfusions coupled with steroids and chemotherapy.

He spent decades rising up the ranks at companies like Campbell Soup Kraft Foods and the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers.

The whole time he kept a dark secret: In 1965 at age 16 Miller pleaded guilty to the second-degree murder of another teenager in Philadelphia serving four and a half years in prison. Shortly after he served another five for a series of armed robberies.

Miller was publicly identified in the Philadelphia Daily News after pleading guilty to the murder charge according to research conducted by Sports Illustrated but nobody seemed to notice as he entered and progressed through the corporate world. It stayed that way until October when he and his daughter Laila Lacy announced they were co-writing and publishing a tell-all memoir ""Jump: My Secret Journey From the Streets to the Boardroom.""

The memoir published last month — and writing it was freeing Miller told Sports Illustrated in October. More importantly he said: He hoped it could prove that formerly incarcerated people are capable of rehabilitation and success.

""It's really about making sure that people understand that formerly incarcerated people can make a contribution"" Miller said. ""And that person's mistake or the worst mistake that they make in their life shouldn't control what happens with the rest of [their] life.""

Miller now in his 70s added that ""some of the most creative intelligent smart people"" he has met were in prison. All of their talents and abilities were ""being wasted inside the jails"" he said.

While incarcerated Miller pursued an education using Pell grants available to inmates. Then he attended college through a day-release program. On Sunday he told CNN that the experience ""made me start to believe that I could actually change my life.""

Around the same time as his release he graduated from Temple University at age 30. He was an interview away from landing a position at a major accounting firm when he decided to disclose his criminal background. He didn't get the job and spent the rest of his career hiding his previous incarceration.

Miller told Sports Illustrated he never lied on an application but could usually find loopholes. Most applications only asked if he'd been convicted in the prior five years he said. But as he became more successful he started suffering migraine headaches and nightmares.

""There was always this tension and this fear that somehow this is going to come out and it's going to ruin everything I've built up to this point"" he told CNN.

Lacy told Sports Illustrated that she spent years encouraging Miller to break that tension by writing the book. And Miller said he consulted with a close circle of friends and colleagues including NBA legend Michael Jordan and Nike co-founder Phil Knight before deciding to do it.

Ahead of the book's release some controversy did erupt: The family of the teenager Miller killed in 1965 felt blindsided especially when the Sports Illustrated article publicly named the victim then-18-year-old Edward White.

In December Miller met with White's sister Barbara Mack and his two children Hasan Adams and Azizah Arline. Mack and Adams told the New York Times they could forgive Miller. Arline said she needed more time.

According to the Times Miller in is discussions with the family to establish a scholarship foundation funded in perpetuity to help White's descendants — and potentially others too — attend college or trade school.

""If nothing else comes out of this book … the most important thing for me is to be able to know that in spite of the pain and hurt I caused their family that they're willing to forgive me"" Miller told CNBC's ""The News with Shepard Smith"" last month.

On March 26th 1987. Tinker Hatfield revolutionized the sneaker industry with the design of the Nike Air Max 1. Decades later the silhouette has inspired dozens of models across the NIKE Inc. roster. And as it celebrates its 35th anniversary the trend continues.

Recently a similar-looking pair emerged with some notable modifications. Touted as the Nike Air Max Motif the newly-surfaced silhouette maintains a number of heritage-derived details including curved reinforcement panels across the upper a visible Air unit towards the heel and a waffle-patterned outsole. “Grey Fog” and “Light Smoke Grey” tones come together to allow the titular “Photon Dust” that appears around the forefoot and upper eyelets to revel in the spotlight (Hatfield’s original sketch of the AM 1 is believed to have featured similar yellow flair). Underfoot the semi-translucent midsole also reveals foam donning the same color for an ensemble that’s equal parts heritage and modern.

Enjoy official images of the pair here below and anticipate a Nike.com launch soon.

JB Pritzker purchased stock in large Medicaid contractor BGA says

SPRINGFIELD Ill. (WLS) -- A Better Government Association investigation claimed a blind trust connected to Governor JB Pritzker bought stock in one of the state's biggest Medicaid contractors.

The purchase of stock in health insurance giant Centene Corp. was made on behalf of the billionaire governor by trustees at Northern Trust appointed by Pritzker to independently manage his portfolio to separate those investment decisions from his role as the state's most powerful elected official.

The investment in Centene which collected more than $2.6 billion from state Medicaid contracts in the first half of 2021 demonstrated the pitfalls of a blind-trust arrangement that still leaves the nation's richest governor open to potential conflicts of interest according to the Better Government Association investigation.

The communications director for Pritzker's campaign said the governor has no involvement in investment decisions. In a statement to ABC7 Natalie Edelstein said ""Governor Pritzker did divest his personal portfolio of companies holding state contracts and then removed himself from all investment decisions."" Edelstein added that ""to suggest he broke his campaign pledge is false"" and ""the trustees provide Governor Pritzker only with an annual report of his assets which contains no values in order to sign his Statement of Economic Interests pursuant to the Illinois Governmental Ethics Act.""

The issue of stock purchases by elected officials has been debated in Congress which is considering an array of strengthened stock disclosure laws aimed at stopping lawmakers from profiting from their access to insider information.

""This effort is being undertaken because members of Congress are personally engaged in trading stock which Governor Pritzker is not. Governor Pritzker does not personally make any investments nor has he been involved in any discussions at any time regarding any investments since taking office"" Pritzker's campaign said.

Experts interviewed by the Better Government Association said the governor could have avoided potential conflict by instructing his trust managers to refrain from investing in state contractors. Pritzker's spokespeople declined to say whether he ever considered doing so.

""I don't see why a trustee couldn't operate within those bounds especially given that he seems to have acknowledged the potential of a conflict with his pledge to divest of companies that hold state contracts"" said Eleanor Eagan of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.

Neither Pritzker representatives nor the managers of his trust would say how much the investment in Centene is worth to Pritzker's bottom line. They also declined to say specifically when the stock purchase was made the BGA said.

When asked whether the governor after learning he became invested in one of the state's largest contractors sometime during 2020 took steps to recuse himself from decisions that directly affected the company's finances his spokeswoman told the BGA he has not.

""The governor is not involved in the contracting process related to Centene"" said Jordan Abudayyeh Pritzker's communication director. ""There is nothing he would have to recuse himself from.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaXR5Yml6LmNvL2FydGljbGUvMjIzMDc2L2hhcnJ5LWNvbm5pY2stanItbGlnaHRzLXVwLXRoZS1icm93YXJkLWNlbnRlci1zdGFnZS1mb3ItdGhlLWJyb3dhcmQtcGVyZm9ybWluZy1hcnRzLWZvdW5kYXRpb24tYW5udWFsLWNlbGVicmF0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Harry Connick Jr. Lights Up the Broward Center Stage for the Broward Performing Arts Foundation Annual Celebration,"Funds raised benefit education and enrichment programs of the Center

It was an evening of highlights and the brightest of all was Harry Connick Jr. who lit up the stage at the Broward Performing Arts Foundation’s Annual Celebration. The event presented by Dr. Lee and Brigitte Mandel and the South Florida Sinus and Allergy Center raised $678000 for the education and enrichment programs of the Broward Center for the Performing Arts.

There were enough special moments to keep guests entertained all evening long. They started with a pre-show cocktail reception on the Wendt Terraces at the Huizenga Pavilion before moving into the Au-Rene Theater for Connick’s spectacular performance. Once in the theater it was like old times with a full house and an audience eager to celebrate the return of live performances. It had been two long years and people were ready to party.

After the performance as the stage was being transformed into an elegant supper club guests were served champagne at their seats and Broward Performing Arts Foundation chair Richard Welch Foundation president Lisa Kitei and Broward Center president & CEO Kelley Shanley spoke to them from the stage. Welch proposed a toast to the return of live theater and the resiliency of the Broward Center staff. “Congratulations to everyone who made this possible” he said. “Let’s have some fun tonight.”

Kitei and Shanley both recognized the supporters of the Center. Kitei thanked the Celebration sponsors underwriters and guests. “The people in this room are the people who kept us going every night not just tonight and for that we are very grateful” she said. Shanley too spoke of the important role played by the Center’s supporters and staff in getting through the pandemic. “We got here with the help of our friends” he said. “We are able to enjoy this evening together because of all the people who believed in us and did what they needed to do in order to bring us to the other side.”

At the conclusion of his remarks Shanley announced dinner by saying “We are coming down to pick you up and take you on stage with us.” And to the cheers of more than 350 guests the thrust of the stage was lowered the curtain was raised and everyone stepped onstage to enjoy dinner and dancing for the rest of the evening.

As revealed by this newspaper last year the country’s largest private health operator is planning a new 150-bed unit medical facility at the Ballysimon​ Road in the shadow of the Northern Trust building.

The new hospital is set to triple existing capacity from its current location at Barrington’s Hospital in George’s Quay – which will remain.

But the new state-of-the-art centre will be located on a seven-acre site to the east of the city.

The complex which has been designed by an international award-winning team of architects will comprise a new 19405 square metre four storey hospital with roof-top garden and energy centre along with associated site development works.

It will provide both inpatient and outpatient facilities for medical and surgical patients with treatment rooms operating theatres endoscopy unit and supporting staff and patient facilities.

It’s been designed by Reddy Architecture and Urbanism in partnership with HOK International.

Should planning permission be forthcoming on this project the hospital group says works could commence by the end of this year.

The facility could become operational as early as 2025.

Bon Secours chief executive Jason Kenny said: “We are delighted to be at this stage of the process with the submission of our planning application for a private hospital to cater for the needs of our patients in Limerick and the Mid-West.”

Denis O'Sullivan the group director of capital projects at Bon Secours Health System Ireland added: “When we embarked on this project our objective was to design a facility that would be in keeping with the delivery of world-class compassionate medical care to patients that the Bon Secours Health System is synonymous with. It’s fair to say that the plans developed by our team fulfil all we would have hoped for.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vcnRoZXJuaXJlbGFuZHdvcmxkLmNvbS9oZWFsdGgvcm95YWwtY29sbGVnZS1vZi1zdXJnZW9ucy12aXNpdHMtbHZoLTM1ODU3ODnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal College of Surgeons visits LVH,"Mr Mark Taylor (NI Director Royal College of Surgeons England/Consultant Surgeon) Miss Sue Hill (Council Member RCS England/Consultant Vascular Surgeon) Professor Neil Mortensen (President RCS England/Consultant Surgeon) Roisin Coulter (Chief Executive South Eastern HSC Trust) & Mr Charlie Martyn (Medical Director South Eastern HSC Trust)

Before the pandemic Lagan Valley had been identified as a potential site for a Regional Day Procedure Centre for patients who had been waiting a long time for day surgical procedures.

The types of procedures to be undertaken had been agreed pilots had been undertaken and the hospital was ready to commence as a Regional facility.

However the pandemic hit and the Trust realised that throughout Northern Ireland many urgent and suspect cancer procedures were being cancelled due to staffing issues and the need to increase ICU capacity across the region.

Staff chat with Miss Sue Hill and Professor Mortensen

This prompted the Trust to reconsider the current activity being undertaken in the Day Procedure Centre and it was agreed that all lists would be converted to priority lists that would be available to the Region for urgent and suspect cancer cases that were appropriate for the facility.

The South Eastern Trust planned to ensure Lagan Valley was a green pathway to minimise the patient’s risk of being exposed to the virus. A separate entrance was provided to the Day Procedure Centre ensuring that testing protocols were adhered to by patients.

The Assistant Director for Elective Services Chris Allam said there were a number of hurdles to overcome: “We had to gain the confidence of patients to attend for their procedure during the pandemic. Demand for lists exceeded capacity so we had to ensure there was equity of access for all Trusts across the Region.

“Staff had to be trained to carry out procedures they had never been involved with previously and as the pandemic continued the issue of patients not attending for their COVID-19 swab appointment become a real issue and resulted in lost capacity.”

Staff from Lagan Valley Hospital chat with Professor Mortensen

Chris Allam detailed how since the start of the pandemic the DPC has provided over 2000 priority treatments. “These have been in a number of areas including general surgery urology gynaecology ophthalmology and renal. These are procedures that would have otherwise been delayed. As this is a regional initiative all Trusts have been able to avail of this opportunity and all have participated fully.”

Clinical co-chair of the Regional Day Proedure Network & Consultant Anaesthetist with the Belfast Trust Dr Rosie Hogg stressed “The dedication and enthusiasm of all of the staff at the Lagan Valley DPC during the last 18 months to deliver timely and high quality care to patients from across Northern Ireland has been remarkable. Regional day procedure centres are an integral part of the transformation of elective surgical care in Northern Ireland to achieve increased efficiency and equality of access to patients from across the region”.

The Day Procedure Centre will eventually revert back to its original purpose which is to provide a regional facility for those patients who have waited an unacceptable length of time for their routine procedure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHl0cnVzdC5jb20vaW4tbm9ydGhlcm4tbmlnZXJpYXMtaXNsYW1peXlhLXNjaG9vbHMtcGFlZG9waGlsZXMtbHVyay1hcm91bmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,INVESTIGATION: Inside northern Nigeria’s Islamiyya schools where paedophiles lurk around,"Violence in any school hampers the participation of the girl-child in education and other development programmes.

Violence in any school hampers the participation of the girl-child in education and other development programmes. Sexual violence in places considered ‘safe’ for children such as Islamiyya schools have a lasting physical and mental challenge on survivors. Daily Trust on Sunday looks at how the culture of silence stigma and shame are creating an enabling environment for paedophiles lurking around northern Nigeria’s Islamiyya schools.

At 12 Halima (real name withheld) is eight months pregnant. She used to hawk chin-chin a popular Nigerian snack around her village of Unguwan Fantaro in Kachia Local Government Area of Kaduna State. Sometime in June 2021 Halima who lived with her widowed mother was lured by a respectable allo teacher (an elementary Islamic teacher) called Salihu on the guise of buying chin-chin worth N200. Inside his room adjacent a tsangaya school (traditional Qur’anic school) where he tutors young boys to memorise the Qur’an Salihu covered Halima’s mouth and forced himself on her. Almost three months later a neighbour suspected that Halima was pregnant and collected her urine sample for test. It returned positive and Halima was forced to speak.

“He threatened to kill me if I told anyone” she told Daily Trust eight months later in Kaduna metropolis where she is awaiting a caesarean section to deliver the baby.

“He raped me multiple times and I didn’t know I was pregnant until the test result came back and my mother’s sister demanded I tell her the truth” Halima whispered in Hausa language.

After Salihu was accosted he initially denied the crime until the police arrested him and charged him to court.

Six months apart and about 130 kilometers away from Unguwan Fantoro a six-year-old returned home from her Islamic school bleeding from her private part.

Aisha (real name withheld) a student of Madrasatul Ulumul Deeniya wa Tahfizul Qur’an lives with her mother and grandmother in Rigasa a densely populated Muslim community in Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State.

Her grandmother Hajiya Batul Gambo struggled through emotions as she narrated how her granddaughter bled profusely after she was raped in an Islamic school. When she demanded justice Hajiya Batul said the school teachers had assaulted her.

“The police didn’t help me either. Initially they directed us to a hospital and when I noticed they were not being sincere I sought help from a Foundation which immediately took my granddaughter to a government-owned hospital for examination” she said.

At the Yusuf Dantsoho Memorial Hospital which houses one of the Kaduna State’s Sexual Assault Referral Centres (SARC) it was confirmed that Aisha had been raped and a medical report stated that on examination there was “bleeding of the vagina bruising of the labia minora bilaterally periurethral bruising haematoma of the clitoris and laceration of the hymen.”

In Nigeria six out of every 10 children have suffered one or more forms of physical sexual or emotional violence before they reached 18 years. According to a 2014 survey by the National Population Commission (NPF) with support from the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the United States (US) Centre for Disease Control and Prevention one in four girls experience sexual violence and one in six girls experience emotional violence. The report revealed that most of the perpetrators are known to the child and the violence often takes place where the child should ordinarily be safe.

Safe spaces for children such as Islamiyya schools conventional schools places of worship and even homes no longer appear safe as both Halima and Aisha were either assaulted within the school environment or by a ‘revered’ member of the community.

Kaduna State where the two incidents occurred has four sexual assault referral centres established at the Yusuf Dantshoho Memorial Hospital Tudun wada; Gwamna Awan Hospital Nasarawa; Gambo Sawaba Hospital Zaria and Sir Patrick Yakowa Memorial Hospital Kafanchan. The centres in 2021 recorded 1668 cases of sexual violence although in Nigeria true figures of sexual violence remain elusive due to the tendency by most families not to report abuses and instead cover them up. The state’s Commissioner for Human Services and Social Development Hajiya Hafsat Baba whose ministry oversees the centres said out of the 1668 cases reported in 2021 records show that 1325 were female victims while the remaining 343 were males.

Growing cases of sexual abuse by ‘Islamic teachers’

The Kaduna State Government in December 2021 shutdown Madrasatul Ulumul Deeniya wa Tahfizul Qur’an the school where a six-year-old Aisha was raped. It also shut down another Islamic school in Kachia Local Government Area where Malam Salihu the alleged rapist of the 12-year-old Halima used to tutor.

The overseer of the Kaduna State School’s Quality Assurance Authority Idris Aliyu told Daily Trust on Sunday that the two schools were not registered with the state government. He said all the schools that claim to run a combination of Islamic and conventional education must register with the School’s Quality Assurance Authority while those that offer Islamic education exclusively are expected to register with the state’s Bureau of Interfaith. He however said that in the case of the two schools available records showed they were not registered.

“And if they are not registered they are not even eligible to run the place as a school” he said.

Northern Nigeria is home to thousands of non-state schools mostly neighbourhood Islamic schools that comprise of makarantar allo tsangaya and Islamiyya many of which are privately owned largely unregistered and unregulated.

Available data on the number of these Islamic schools is almost no-existent but a 2018 study on non-state schools in Kaduna State prepared for USAID showed that due to a lack of robust data government officials estimate an additional 2000 unregistered non-state schools deeply rooted in local communities of Kaduna that operate in isolation of government. Due of the density of population and high levels of poverty most law income households prefer to send their children to such schools where majority have no formal system of fee payment.

It was in such Islamiyya that in 2020 Hassan Bilyaminu and Abdullahi Bilyaminu two Islamic teachers defiled four under-aged girls and were later sentenced by a Minna Chief Magistrate’s Court II in Niger State to a combined 22 years imprisonment. The convicts who pleaded guilty were convicted on two-count charges which bothered on the act of gross indecency and sexual abuse.

In 2019 a High Court sitting in Maiduguri sentenced a 19-year-old Islamic teacher Sulaiman Abubakar of Ngomari Costine area of Maiduguri to 10 years imprisonment for defiling a six-year-old. The convict a teacher in the school was said to have lured the victim to a staff room after school hours and raped her. Prior to that the police in Gombe State had in 2018 arrested a 26-year-old Quranic teacher Bilyaminu Halilu for allegedly raping his five-year-old student while in the same year the Kano State police command arrested a 41-year-old Islamic teacher Alhaji Aminu Musa for allegedly raping an eight-year-old female student.

Sexual assault on minors is not limited to Islamic schools alone as according to the United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) the prevalence of sexual abuse on young girls and in some cases boys in and around settings intended as a place of safety and learning for children can act as a deterrent for parents to send girls to school. This is particularly worrisome in Nigeria where over 10.5 million children are out of school; the highest rate in the world with over 69 per cent of the figure from northern Nigeria. Of these children four in five are said to receive some kind of Islamic religious education.

The national president of the Muslim Lawyers Association of Nigeria (MULAN) Prof Ibrahim Abdulkadir explained that accusations of sexual abuse in Islamiyya schools had existed for years but rarely reported.

“In those days people didn’t ask questions about what happened in those schools although from time in memorial you always find that in most cases male children live with the Malams while the female go and come back to the school.

“We cannot deny that even before now such accusations existed but in most cases they were not reported and when a child reported they would just withdraw her from the school and that ended it” he said.

Abdulkadir said that because Islamic schools sustained the knowledge of religion and translation of its teachings to the current generation all efforts must be put in place to stop such acts by those who intend to “abuse the sacredness of the institution.” He said unless actions were taken such assaults could stop young girls from seeking Islamic knowledge and stressed the need for the girl-child to be as knowledgeable in religion as her male counterpart.

Silenced by fear stigma shame

There are shocking revelations of physical and sexual abuse that goes unnoticed in northern Nigeria’s largely unregulated traditional Islamic schools although emphasis had in the past centred around physical abuse on male children popularly referred to as almajirai who attend Qur’anic schools outside their communities.

The culture of silence stigma and shame is however creating an enabling environment for paedophiles to molest female minors and get away with it.

The Kaduna State police command confirmed that a lot of cases of sexual abuse against girls emanated from densely populated communities where abusers are often revered.

“Silenced by fear shame and stigma young girls and their families are forced to settle sexual assaults at the family or community levels instead of reporting the matter to the police and pursuing justice in court” the police public relations officer Kaduna command ASP Mohammed Jalige said.

“Because of tradition and culture people don’t tend to talk no matter how painful. They truly don’t go further to seek justices” said Hajiya Hafsat Baba the Kaduna State Commissioner for Human Services and Social Development.

Hajiya Hafsat who has a background in the civil society before her appointment as commissioner to oversee Kaduna’s human services and social development said “Sometimes the parents don’t support you if you want to get justice for the child. Some of the parents are part of those who will come to beg you and tell you that they have forgiven.

“We also have issues where people complain about the slow process of justice so you find out that people just give up. But we encourage them never to give up because at the end of the day justice will be served.

“Sometimes you have a family setting where a woman doesn’t have a voice. A woman may want to get justice for her child but the husband is saying no he has already forgiven. That is a serious challenge to her and to us because she cannot speak out no matter how you try to sensitise her.

“Then you also have a situation where people would want to settle at home instead of accessing justice.”

For community organisations helping to address issues of sexual violation at the local level it is frustrating to watch sexual predators walk free because of the culture of silence.

Speaking on the development Hajiya Maryam Yahaya Sani the director of Ummulkhairi Foundation and Khalifa Mahmud Community Development Initiative a local initiative aiding to address human right violations among the downtrodden said that most times families only speak out when the victim becomes pregnant. And even then she said the matter was settled if the perpetrator agreed to marry the victim.

“Time and time again we see these young girls some have delivered babies some are pregnant and some raped and emotionally bruised. Most times they are under 15 years and in some cases the perpetrators agree to marry them and that settles the matter” she told our correspondent.

Hajiya Maryam who is now fostering the 12-year-old Halima until her caesarean section narrated how an HIV positive rapist defiled a 10-year-old girl some 15 years ago but the parents settled the matter at the family level.

“It was 15 years later when the victim was about to get married that it was discovered that she had contracted HIV from the rape” she said.

Facing community backlash

Feeling perplexed Hajiya Batul Gambo whose granddaughter Aisha was raped said she didn’t understand why her neighbours and the rest of the neighbourhood in Rigasa Kaduna’s Igabi Local Government Area now appear hostile towards her. The 70-year-old said that instead of support she is often met with glares and sometimes condemnation from a highly conservative community that blames her for the shutdown of an Islamic school.

“Someone even approached me and said there was no justification for closing down a school because of what happened to an individual. Some see me as fighting Islam” she said.

It is a similar backlash for Hajiya Maryam Yahaya Sani whose foundation rushed Aisha to the hospital. She said she had been nick-named Ummulsharri (woman of ill-will). “People think because such a thing happened in an Islamic school I being a Muslim shouldn’t be seen in the forefront of exposing it. They now accuse us of cooking up the story of rape to smear the Islamiyya school” she told Daily Trust on Sunday.

According to the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) the security agency investigating the rape case in Kaduna it has been unable to carry out identification parade on suspects because the school has been shutdown. The Gender Desk Officer of the NSCDC in Kaduna ASC Shehu Maiyaki however said statements had been obtained from the school teachers and nannies with investigations ongoing.

Shortly after the incident the school had gone on holidays and the state government shut it down.

“The victim said she could identify the culprit although she doesn’t know him by name. So we plan to do an identification parade as soon as the school opens and take it up from there” Maiyaki said.

But as investigations continue to drag Hafsat Baba said some members of the community had made efforts to reach out to her ministry to let the matter rest.

“I don’t even understand it” she said sounding confused. “They are supposed to frown at it what does the Qur’an say about people who violate others? There is punishment for that so why are people even coming to beg?”

She said backlashes in form of insults and even threats were expected and even normal but emphasised that the right thing must be done to ensure justice.

“The backlash has strengthened me because it is a religious school. There is no justification for a child to be molested. We need answers; and it doesn’t matter whether it is a school that offers western education Christian Islamic or Hindu there is absolutely no religion that will tolerate a child being molested in school including as Islamiyya” she said.

Laws that protect children

In Nigeria violence against children often goes unpunished although the federal government has enacted the Child Rights Act (2003) a law yet to be domesticated by at least nine states all in the northern part of the country. Many states in the country’s densely populated northern region where numerous Islamiyya schools are springing up are faced with poverty population explosion and a high number of street children making it an easy target for paedophiles and other sexual predators.

Kaduna State in North-West Nigeria where Halima and Aisha were raped has signed the Violence Against Persons Prohibition Law 2018 and the Child’s Welfare and Protection Law 2018. The state government in 2020 also signed the amended penal code law which amended section 258 number 5 of 2017 and provides for stiff penalties for rape of a child which includes death surgical castration for male convicts and bilateral salpingectomy for female rapists. The state is yet to test this law.

However Section 32(1) of the Child’s Welfare and Protection Law 2018 states that a person who sexually abuses a child in any manner commits an offence while subsection (2) of the law further states that a person who commits an offence under subsection (1) of this section is liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term of 14 years.

These laws however have not protected children as sexual violence still occurs in settings assumed to be ‘safe’ for children including schools and faith-based organisations where perpetrators are sometimes teachers or peers.

The Kaduna State police command’s spokesman ASP Mohammed Jalige described lack of cooperation from victim’s parents tampering with evidence and late report of sexual assaults as the major setback in effective prosecution perpetrators.

The International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA) said it had continued to follow cases of abuse of girls and is equally worried about the slow pace of justice which sometimes leads to loss of interests by victims and their families.

“If we can have special courts to try these cases we will be happy. These are criminal cases and we don’t know whether the judges will want to have special courts for criminal cases. But if we can have special courts to fast track these crimes it will be fine” said Kaduna State FIDA chairperson Hajiya Aisha Abdu.

Giving voice shelter to survivors

Local foundations are networking to not only give victims a voice but ensure that information travels fast and victims of sexual violence are given immediate medical and psychological attention. It was through this system that Hajiya Batul Gambo said her granddaughter was able to get medical attention and a government action led to the closure of the school where her daughter was raped.

Working with civil society organisations and committees such as the Child Protection Gender Violence Response Team technical working groups trained security agents as well as religious and traditional leaders Hajiya Hafsat said information was provided to government agencies to quickly take action and provide support for victims.

A UNICEF (2020) action to end child sexual abuse and exploitation provides three effective responses through implementation and enforcement of laws and policies regulating demand and prevention as well as creating safe environments and institutions for victims.

“Those who abuse young girls whether Islamic teachers or not should be jailed” Hajiya Maryam Sani Yahaya said adding that Nigeria has the laws and policies but enforcement remains a challenge.

“All Islamiyya schools should be registered monitored and regulated by government” she said.

Safe houses not only provide a lifeline for women and girls but succour and counselling for victims of abuse in communities according to the Kaduna State Commissioner for Human Services and Social Development who commissioned the women’s transit shelter to ensure that victims have a safe shelter to stay.

Hajiya Hafsat said the shelter with a team of health experts provided care psychosocial support and counselling to enable survivors get out of their trauma.

To check acts of sexual assaults in Islamiyya schools MULAN president Prof Abdulkadir calls for more Islamic-oriented non-governmental organisations in the North adding that secular non-governmental organisations may have limitations.

“If secular non-governmental organisations try to speak about these issues in Islamic schools some people may think they are meddling as it is not within their religious purview” he said calling on governments in northern Nigeria to promote religious-oriented organisations to increase sensitisation on sex education and human rights which he said were rarely discussed in the conservative northern region.

NASA said in a statement it hopes the small orbiting instrument could help predict a volcanic eruption before an explosion happens.

The device recently launched aboard a Northrop Grumman Cygnus spacecraft. Cygnus arrived at the International Space Station on February 21 carrying a large load of supplies and scientific experiments.

NASA calls the instrument NACHOS which stands for Nanosat Atmospheric Chemistry Hyperspectral Observation System. It contains imaging sensors designed to identify gases like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. The presence of those gases can signal possible volcanic activity.

NACHOS was built to observe trace gases in areas as small as 0.4 square kilometers. The six-kilogram instrument is set to be deployed in May. It will operate attached to a CubeSat a small satellite weighing less than 10 kilograms. NASA says NACHOS will observe from about 480 kilometers above Earth’s surface.

NASA considers the instrument a “prototype” meaning its operations and observations will be studied during its orbit which is expected to last one year. The agency says NACHOS will be “the smallest highest resolution space-based instrument” ever sent to observe atmospheric gases.

Steve Love is a scientist with the Department of Energy’s Los Alamos National Laboratory which is cooperating with NASA on NACHOS. He said in a statement that “a dormant volcano just waking” may give off sulfur dioxide before there is any observable volcanic activity.

“That gives us a chance to identify a potentially erupting volcano before it actually blows” Love said.

Such a device could help emergency officials take early measures to protect citizens and property from volcanic eruptions. But NASA says NACHOS can help scientists on Earth in other ways too.

The instrument can also be used to observe gas levels from natural and human-made sources that can be harmful to humans. One gas that NACHOS will search for is nitrogen dioxide which often comes from burning fossil fuels. Identifying the gas could help scientists find areas with high levels of harmful pollution.

“When we recognize that these gases are present and can localize their sources … we have the opportunity to take action and minimize negative health outcomes” Love said.

In the past NASA has created satellites to observe these kinds of gases. But Love said those traditionally required high-resolution images and sensitive instruments that were costly to produce and operate.

Smaller devices like NACHOS could enable a wider use of the technology at a much lower cost. If it proves successful the technology could also be used in Earth-based systems NASA says.

“More power and less weight set NACHOS apart and make it an excellent candidate for future atmospheric trace gas missions” Love said.

NASA says after NACHOS is deployed Love and his team will spend three months testing its systems and getting the instrument fully operational.

During its yearlong mission the team will study the instrument’s performance to learn whether the technology should be further developed.

A second NACHOS instrument NASA said will be deployed to low-Earth orbit in the winter of 2022 as part of a U.S. Department of Defense program.

They want them to learn something.

The bakery which has two locations in the city celebrates Black History Month by creating a cake to honor a different prominent Black activist entertainer athlete scientist or historical figure every day in February.

The chocolate cakes with powdered sugar silhouettes have honored dozens of prominent Black Americans ranging from performers like rapper Megan Thee Stallion to Evelyn Nicol an immunologist instrumental to creating the polio vaccine.

“I feel like often Black History Month comes along and people think about certain athletes and entertainers and Martin Luther King Jr. Not to diminish the contributions or power of that but what I wanted to do was to just show more of the breadth of contributions that African Americans have made to American society and culture” said Jason Becton co-owner of MarieBette.

Becton and his husband and bakery co-owner Patrick Evans started making breads to honor prominent Civil Rights activists during their first year in business. Evans enjoys creating stencil art on breads and cakes and had the idea to use this talent to promote Black History Month.

The breads received such a positive response that Becton and Evans decided this should become a bigger project. This year they created a cake for each day of Black History Month. Evans creates the stencil art while Becton researches which figures should be honored.

The cakes are on display in the bakery’s two locations and are available for purchase. The confectionary creations are also posted on Instagram and Facebook where even those far from Charlottesville can learn the history.

Becton said they’ve gotten a pretty big response to the cakes on social media. Some honorees have even seen the cakes on social media and Becton said it’s been exciting to see their reactions.

“Poet Amanda Gorman was the first person we featured and she saw the post and commented on it. Lester Holt the NBC News anchor also saw the posts and commented on and thanked us. We’ve had a lot of that this year” Becton said. “So it’s nice to also see how it gets back to the people we’re featuring. It’s just a very small way that we’re honoring them but it’s appreciated.”

Evans still creates the stencils himself but his process has changed as the project has gotten bigger. While he used to trace portraits of the individuals and then tediously cut the stencils by hand he now has machine assistance.

Meanwhile Becton has dug deeper into his research becoming passionate about discovering and honoring Black Americans who have made major contributions to society but aren’t household names in addition to more well-known entertainers and athletes.

“For example Robert Smalls should be much more well known. He’s a Civil War hero who was enslaved and then he escaped his enslavement and took a bunch of people with him commandeered a Confederate ship managed to get it to Union Territory and then joined the army and after the war became a U.S. representative” Becton said. “So it’s been a really cool way for us to almost have community education through Facebook and Instagram and also for ourselves because I feel like a lot of these people should be well known and they’re not.”

Becton has also shifted some focus to recognizing Black Americans native to Charlottesville.

“I have a friend who works at the McIntire School and he had his class do a marketing project on what we’re doing for Black History Month. The class gave a presentation and said we should have some more local people. So we started trying to find some local African Americans who contributed to either nationally or globally or even more specifically for this town” he said.

This year MarieBette honored Gregory Swanson the first African American to attend the University of Virginia. In 2021 MarieBette honored Eugene Williams a former local NAACP president and affordable housing activist in Charlottesville. Becton said he was able to meet Williams and his family when MarieBette honored him with a cake.

“[Williams] is a force in town and he’s done a lot but not a lot of people know about him or that he exists and it felt good to give him his moment” Becton said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2Vmb2N1cy5jb20vc3BhY2UvbmFzYS1sdW5hci1nYXRld2F50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NASA's Lunar Gateway: The plans for a permanent space station that will orbit the Moon,"If all goes to plan sometime in 2022 NASA’s Space Launch System rocket (SLS) will blast off from Cape Canaveral Florida for its maiden flight. The giant SLS rocket fully 111.25m tall is set to launch no earlier than February but probably not until the summer and will send an uncrewed capsule on a test mission around the far side of the Moon and back again. Known as Artemis 1 it will truly mark the beginning of humanity’s return to the Moon.

The Artemis 2 mission currently scheduled for May 2024 will repeat Artemis 1 but this time with a crew of astronauts. In their looping journey around the Moon they’ll go further into space than any previous astronaut. Then comes the big one: Artemis 3 which will carry the next astronauts to land on the Moon.

In between these tent-pole missions will be a sequence of other launches to ensure the astronauts have everything they need to complete their missions when they reach lunar orbit. Absolutely critical to the long-term success of the Artemis programme is the Gateway lunar space station.

Gateway will be a multi-module space station in orbit around the Moon. It will act as a staging post for visits to the lunar surface provide an orbital platform from which to conduct remote observations of the Moon and provide laboratories to analyse Moon rocks and conduct other scientific studies. It’s an international effort between the US 10 European countries Canada and Japan.

It may sound like science fiction but it’s very real. And very very cool…

The science

Gateway will act as a temporary home and workspace for astronauts visiting the Moon much like the International Space Station does for astronauts visiting low Earth orbit. During the initial exploration of the Moon astronauts will live on Gateway for up to three months occasionally travelling down to the lunar surface to conduct science or test devices that will allow them to set up a permanent base on the surface.

Two experiments that have already been commissioned for Gateway are a radiation monitor supplied by the European Space Agency (ESA) and a space weather instrument suite. The radiation monitor will help decide how to keep astronauts safe from unhealthy levels of radiation that can be encountered in space. The space weather instrument suite is related to this because it will measure the intensity of particles released by the Sun during outbursts called coronal mass ejections.

A big focus will be on developing the technique of in-situ resource utilisation. This means using resources found on the Moon to manufacture things that the astronauts will need for example water oxygen rocket fuel and building materials can all be extracted or manufactured from materials found on or just below the lunar surface.

The modules

Although smaller than the International Space Station (ISS) Gateway is too large to be launched on a single rocket. Instead it will consist of a number of modules that will be placed around the Moon in a series of launches.

At its heart is the Power and Propulsion Element being developed by Maxar Technologies in the US. This module uses solar panels to generate power. It can also convert that power into propulsion using a ‘solar electric propulsion’ unit (or ion engine) to move the station into different orbits.

The Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO) module is being supplied by Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems. This will be the first module in which astronauts can live. It will include docking ports for the Orion spacecraft carrying the astronauts.

Together these two modules form a workable initial station. Although they were initially planned to be launched separately and then docked in space NASA will now fix the two modules together and fly them on a single launch scheduled for November 2024 on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket.

This will be the configuration of the Gateway for the Artemis 3 Moon landing mission but it will soon be joined by modules supplied by ESA. Europe is a major contributor to Gateway and the Artemis missions. Italy in particular is a significant partner with a distinguished heritage in space station design and manufacture. Around half the pressurised modules on the ISS were supplied by Thales Alenia Space in Turin.

“That is a great legacy” says Luigi Pasquali space activities coordinator of Leonardo the Italian company that jointly owns Thales Alenia Space. It has allowed the company to win the contracts to provide a number of modules for Gateway.

First will be the European System Providing Refueling Infrastructure and Telecommunications (ESPRIT). This will consist of two parts the first will be the station’s lunar communications system. As this is an essential component from day one it’s being manufactured in advance and will be attached to the HALO module for launch in 2024. The second part of ESPRIT will contain additional fuel tanks a windowed habitation corridor and docking ports. Currently it’s scheduled for launch in 2027.

In addition Thales will also contribute the International Habitation Module (I-HAB) which will contain a life support system supplied by Japan. Finally Canada is producing an 8.5m-long robotic arm similar to the one the country contributed to the ISS and Space Shuttle programmes.

Of course having a space station orbiting the Moon is useless if you have no way of getting astronauts to it. That’s where the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle comes in. The crew module is being supplied by NASA via Lockheed Martin in the US and can house up to six astronauts but the heart of the spacecraft is the European Service Module (ESM) that sits behind the crew capsule.

It’s being provided by Europe’s Airbus company. “ESM provides everything that the astronauts need to live” says Siân Cleaver who is the Airbus industrial manager for the ESM.

The ESM is based on the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) also manufactured by Airbus. ATV was one of the European Space Agency’s contributions to the International Space Station. It carried cargo to and from the facility in low-Earth orbit. To transform it into the ESM and get it to the Moon however requires one very obvious difference.

“It’s got a massive main engine on the bottom” says Cleaver.

The first ESM is already on top of the Space Launch System rocket in preparation for the Artemis 1 mission in 2022. The second has been shipped to Florida for mating to the crew capsule. This will be the first Orion to carry astronauts on the Artemis 2 mission. Cleaver and colleagues are working on ESM 3 the one that will take the astronauts to the Gateway station before their descent to the lunar surface.

“It’s definitely mind-blowing. I feel very lucky. It was always my dream to work in human spaceflight” Cleaver says.

The astronauts of Artemis 3 will shuttle to the lunar surface inside a SpaceX Starship craft. After that NASA is beginning to develop a smaller lunar lander for more routine missions to and from the surface.

The spacesuits

To walk on the Moon obviously requires a spacesuit – and these are not simple items of clothing. Spacesuits have constantly evolved to give astronauts the protection and the usability they need. For the Artemis Moon landings those will have to be taken to a whole new level.

If you think of a spacesuit not as a garment but as a flexible spacecraft that you wear then you get closer to the complexity involved in making one. On top of that it should hinder the astronaut’s movements as little as possible.

NASA is designing the eXploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit or xEMU. A big issue for mobility in a spacesuit is the pressure of the air inside. When an astronaut bends a limb it compresses the material and reduces the volume inside the suit leading to an increase in air pressure that resists the motion of the astronaut.

Using bearings at the joints rather than compressible fabric helps address this issue. Whereas the Apollo spacesuits worn by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on their trip to the Moon in 1969 used bearings only in the arms the xEMU will use them in the arms waist hips thighs and ankle joints. The suits will also let the astronauts vary the air pressure allowing them to reduce it in order to kneel down.

All in all the new innovations should provide far more flexibility for the astronauts and a much more comfortable environment in which to work. It should even allow them to walk more normally than the Apollo astronauts who developed a kind of loping gait because of the low lunar gravity combined with the inflexibility of the spacesuit.

The location

Gateway will orbit the Moon on a large elliptical path that will take it over both the lunar north and south poles. It will require almost seven days to complete an orbit. At its furthest it will be 70000km away from the Moon before closing to within 3000km.

The orbit offers easier access to land in the lunar polar regions especially the south pole which is thought to be rich in ice deposits. It also offers excellent communications possibilities with Earth because it means Gateway spends very little time being eclipsed from Earth’s line of sight.

The future

The first thing that Gateway will do is make it easier to establish a permanent base on the Moon. “Gateway has a strategic role in really being able to develop a large presence on the lunar surface” says Pasquali.

This is because it will provide a stable safe base of operation from which to gradually develop the equipment and infrastructure that will bring a lunar base to life.

“I know it’s really cheesy but whenever I look at the Moon I always think about the fact that we’re going there soon. And then I look at the spacecraft in the clean room the next day and I think ‘Okay what I’m doing has a real purpose’” says Cleaver.

And unlike the curtailed exploration of the Moon in the 1970s this time it’s being undertaken with a long-term purpose in mind. In November 2021 NASA confirmed that beyond the Artemis 3 lunar landing the agency is developing a sustainable programme that envisages at least 10 further visits to the Moon’s surface.

And beyond that Mars beckons. This is one reason why the Orion spacecraft is called the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle to indicate that it has uses other than ‘just’ travel to and from the Moon.

And being well outside of the protection of Earth’s magnetic field the Gateway also allows the effects of deep-space radiation on the health of astronauts to be fully assessed. Knowledge of this is critical for a journey to Mars where the cruise time in deep space will be at least nine months.

In short Gateway is essential to all future exploration. Rather than just getting us back to the Moon history may look back at it as the gateway to the human exploration of the entire Solar System.

The cruise company which owns nine cruise operators will announce further details through its brands once the adjusted itineraries are confirmed.

Carnival Removing Calls Due to Situation in Ukraine

Cruise lines are responding to the developing situation in Ukraine and it has already resulted in the cancellation of calls to Russia for some lines. Carnival Corporation which is the largest cruise company in the world and owns nine cruise brands confirmed on Saturday that it will be adjusting itineraries.

Carnival Corp tweeted “In light of the recent attacks by Russia in Ukraine Carnival Corporation brands will be modifying our itineraries in the coming week once alternative ports can be confirmed. We stand for peace.”

The cruise company owns major lines such as Carnival Cruise Line Princess Cruises Holland America Line Costa Cruises and more. Guests booked on upcoming sailings that include a call to Russia can expect to be contacted soon by a specific cruise line or travel agent.

Carnival Corp Chairman Micky Arison also tweeted and confirmed that the company was in the process of securing alternative itineraries “We are in the process of securing alternate itineraries for our cruise ships before announcing our future plans. We will be advising our guests and travel partners shortly as plans become finalized.”

This news comes after many had asked why the company had not yet announced the removal of calls to Russia. One of its brands Princess Cruises stated two days ago “In light of the current situation evolving in Ukraine we understand that it may raise some questions about upcoming voyages. We are monitoring the situation closely and will amend itineraries as necessary as the safety and well-being of guests and crew is our highest priority.”

Holland America Line already released a similar statement but did not go as far as announcing Russia cancellations at the time. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings became the first to announce that it would be canceling all calls to Russia for 2022. There have also been announcements from other smaller lines including Viking Cruises and Windstar Cruises.

Many are calling for cruise lines to swiftly remove calls to Russia including the popular port of call of St. Petersburg. Many countries including the United States the United Kingdom and those across the EU have already announced harsh sanctions. Some of these sanctions include travel such as banning Russian flights.

Real quick Saturday PSA for you: Kendall Jenner is done having her image/life/privacy controlled by others.

In i-D Magazine's new The Out Of Body Issue Kendall stripped down—literally (the pic is 👀🔥👀🔥) but also figuratively in a very candid interview in which she discusses everything from her old school pen-and-paper lock-and-key diary to yelling at paparazzi to taking back control of her image after years of it being her literal job to let people portray her however they wanted.

Here are just a few highlights from the highly-readable profile (srsly go read the whole thing).



She keeps an actual physical diary—but no one is ever ever going to read it.

""It's like an old-fashioned diary. It has a lock on it and I hide it I lock it away: mine is so so secretive. I’m like 'No one can ever get this.'""

Why? Because:

""It’s important to have a space that’s just for you where you can let out your happiness your anger frustrations and stress the things that are freaking you out the things that are making you happy and even just ideas.""

She's past her publicly-yelling-at-paparazzi days tyvm.

""I used to be really angry. I mean you can literally find old videos of me screaming at the paparazzi for no reason but also for a very obvious reason. I’m just a lot more at peace with things now. It’s hard to explain… it’s just something that you learn to live with I guess.""

She's a control freak and she's finally owning it.

""I’m a control freak at heart. At a young age I had to give up that control and let someone else portray me in the way that they wanted to for an editorial or a campaign or commercial–whatever it was. That was my job. Now being on the other side is taking that control back in a way building my own brand and feeling empowered—and it has been really amazing. As a woman and as someone who comes from a really female-driven family it was really cool to put all my tools to work.""

Supervisor Joseph H. Emminger announced Tonawanda's intention to restart the eminent domain process at his annual State of the Town address on Thursday two months after The Buffalo News reported this was a likely next step.

The plant once the town's largest taxpayer closed in 2016 and went up for sale in 2018.

Tonawanda had launched the eminent domain process once before three years ago but scrapped it at the urging of NRG executives who argued the legal fight made it harder to market the property.

Tonawanda presses NRG over failure to sell Huntley site The town vows to revive its efforts to take over the site through eminent domain and to build its own water intake station along the Niagara River

The company continues to argue against the eminent domain proceeding and defended its efforts to sell the Huntley site but town officials are losing patience.

""I trusted them. What's the old saying 'Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me'? I'm not going to be made a fool of again. The town isn't going to be made a fool of again"" Emminger said in an interview.

The electric-generating coal plant on River Road opened in 1916 and closed 100 years later. At the time the station produced $6 million in local property tax revenue and had nearly 80 employees but it also ranked as one of Erie County's worst polluters.

The main Huntley site covers 84 acres with two off-site parcels adding another 124 acres near the Niagara Thruway railroad lines and a water treatment plant.

NRG didn't list the plant for sale until 2018. Later that year concerned at the sluggish sale process town officials launched an effort to take over nearly all of the Huntley site through eminent domain.

That process gives the government the right to acquire private property for a public use as long as it pays fair compensation to the former owner. But it can lead to a lengthy court battle.

NRG successfully persuaded the town that a drawn-out legal process would delay a planned sale to a buyer later identified as an investment team including Michael Ullian. The town ended its eminent domain campaign in September 2019 after spending $24200 on legal fees.

Then in June 2020 NRG without explanation announced the sale agreement was off. Ullian has insisted to The News he was ready and able to proceed with a purchase of the property.

NRG later hired a national consulting firm Vita Nuova to help guide the restarted Huntley sale process. NRG wanted to receive responses or expressions of interest from prospective buyers by May 2021.

NRG has not said how many responses it received. The company previously said its review of those submissions would continue into this year but did not offer specifics.

Local officials frustrated at NRG's process to sell 'eyesore' Huntley site Town officials say they've heard of companies that want to talk to NRG about the property but have not received any follow-up from Huntley's owner or more recently Vita Nuova its consultant.

Emminger said he has not received any recent substantial updates from the company beyond an email last month saying NRG had not selected a buyer yet.

Emminger Ullian and others are convinced NRG isn't in a rush to sell off the Huntley property because it generates revenue from the site.

The plant was a money-loser in its later years but NRG now makes a profit by selling raw water pumped from the Niagara River to neighboring industrial customers the officials said. NRG denies it has a financial motivation to keep the property.

Still the town is moving forward on two fronts to pressure NRG: By constructing a water-pumping station and investing in the infrastructure needed to sell untreated water directly to those manufacturers and by restarting eminent domain.

""I don't know what they've done in two years except delay delay delay — and collect money"" Emminger said.

The Town Board will have to formally vote to begin eminent domain proceedings following at least one public hearing. Emminger said he believes the town could take control of the property within a year although legal wrangling could continue over the value of the site.

One reason the town feels the need to press NRG is because a state fund that offsets some of the lost property tax revenue could expire as soon as 2023.

NRG insists it remains interested in finding a buyer for the property but that an eminent domain proceeding would prove ""disruptive"" to a sale.

""It is important that the town productively engage with NRG so as not to jeopardize that outcome"" spokesman Dave Schrader said in an email.

The brownfield site requires an extensive cleanup and Schrader said NRG has worked with the state Department of Environmental Conservation to determine the extent of that work though Emminger said the company has done the bare minimum required.

At the State of the Town presentation Emminger shared a video rendering of what the Huntley site could look like following a cleanup and redevelopment. Images showed apartment condominium office and commercial structures with ample waterfront access.

""We're going to accelerate the process"" Emminger said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndvb2RsYW5kc29ubGluZS5jb20vbnBwcy9zdG9yeS5jZm0_bnBwYWdlPTcyNDE50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rodeo's 2022 World's Championship Bar-B-Que Contest Winners Announced,"HOUSTON TX -- More than 250 barbecue teams competed at the 2022 Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo World’s Championship Bar-B-Que Contest presented by Cotton Holdings Feb. 24 – 26 2022.

NUE,Nucor,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzAyLzI2LzMtc3RvY2tzLXRvLWhvbGQtcmlnaHQtdGhyb3VnaC10aGUtbmV4dC1tYXJrZXQtZG93L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Stocks to Hold Right Through the Next Market Downturn (and Maybe Even Add to),"These stocks should help you sleep soundly during the next stock market storm.

Stock market corrections can be challenging for investors. The uncertainty makes it tough to know if your stocks will make it through. That's why it's a good idea to make sure you own companies built to endure tough times.

We asked some of our contributors for their favorite stocks to own when times gets tough. Here's why they believe Dominion Energy (D 0.02%) Nucor (NUE -1.67%) and NextEra Energy (NEE 1.58%) are great to hold and even add to when the stock market gets turbulent.

Boring on purpose

Reuben Gregg Brewer (Dominion Energy): Once many years ago Dominion Energy was a widely diversified energy company with oil drilling assets a midstream business and a utility all under one roof. In an effort to simplify its business and minimize risk it has pared its portfolio down to just utilities. This is a regulated business in which Dominion has to justify its rates to regulators and in exchange is granted a monopoly in the areas where it operates.

That makes Dominion a very reliable business given that electricity is basically one of the most important things supporting modern life. Sure demand tends to fall in times of economic weakness but not that much. It is a boring safe stock now that its multiyear transformation has been completed.

But what do investors get now? For starters a fairly generous dividend yield of 3.3% or so. Although the dividend was cut in 2020 that was because of the sale of its midstream business to Berkshire Hathaway.

That sale allowed Dominion to solidify its balance sheet and set it up for more-reliable and robust dividend growth. The goal is to increase the dividend at an annual rate of 6% through 2025 backed by capital investment totaling around $32 billion. Because of the importance of electricity and the regulated nature of the utility sector that spending or at least most of it will take place even if there's a bear market or a recession.

So you can focus on the dividends you are collecting instead of the market turbulence. And if Dominion's shares take a hit too you might even consider bulking up your position so you can collect even more of the growing dividend from what is now a utility-focused business.

Any drop in this stock's price is an opportunity

Neha Chamaria (Nucor): Nucor is the kind of stock that could take a big hit during a market downturn but it's also one stock you'd not only want to hold throughout but even buy while it's still cheap.

I'll give you two reasons: Nucor is one of the most well run and established players in an industry vital to the economy so its stock price is also likely to bottom out quickly once the market bounces back. And in between Nucor should help you earn passive income in the form of a regular dividend which now yields about 1.7%.

In fact Nucor doesn't just pay a regular dividend but is a Dividend Aristocrat that has increased its dividend every year for the last 49 years (leaving it one year away from Dividend King status). Last December Nucor increased its dividend by a solid 23% as the company's profits and cash flows expanded -- 2021 was a record year for Nucor.

With spending on infrastructure on the rise under the Biden administration demand for Nucor's steel products should remain strong. The company is already looking forward to a strong year and there's no reason it won't be able to increase its dividend yet again this year. Given the backdrop you'd want to consider any drop in Nucor's stock price in a market downturn as an opportunity to own a rock-solid infrastructure stock.

A safe haven when the market gets shaky

Matt DiLallo (NextEra Energy): NextEra Energy has one of the lowest-risk business models around. Its Florida-based electric utility generates relatively stable earnings by distributing energy to end-users under government-regulated rates. Meanwhile its clean-energy infrastructure business produces steady cash flow by selling power to other utilities and large electricity consumers secured by long-term fixed-rate contracts.

Adding to NextEra Energy's overall stability is its financial profile. It has a conservative dividend payout ratio for a utility and has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector. That gives it the financial flexibility to continue expanding its operations in Florida and its renewable energy business.

The company already has enough expansion-related investments to grow its earnings per share by 10% this year. Meanwhile it sees earnings growth coming in at or near the upper end of its long-term target range of 6% to 8% annually through 2025. Powering that growth is the company's rising backlog of renewable energy development projects and investments to enhance its utility in Florida. This forecast supports the company's belief that it can increase its dividend by around a 10% annual rate through 2024.

Given the company's steady growth NextEra is a great stock to hold when the market starts to nose-dive. While its share price might take a hit (which would be a good time to add shares) its earnings should continue heading higher even if the economy goes into recession. Add in its rock-solid 2%-plus dividend yield and it's a safe haven amid the market's storm.",,,,,,,,,,,,

‘EVERYONE!!! NVIDIA ARE CRIMINALS!!!!!!!!! ... TODAY WOKE UP AND FOUND NVIDIA SCUM HAD ATTACKED **THE** MACHINE WITH RANSOMWARE…….’ the ransomware group Lapsus$ wrote on Telegram after threatening to leak Nvidia data.

Nvidia in recent days launched a retaliatory strike against the Lapsus$ ransomware gang to prevent the release of the chipmaker’s stolen data the ransomware group claimed.

“EVERYONE!!! NVIDIA ARE CRIMINALS!!!!!!!!! SOME DAYS AGO A ATTACK AGAINST NVIDIA AND STOLE 1TB OF CONFIDENTIAL DATA!!!!!! (sic)” the Lapsus$ operator posted to their public Telegram channel. “TODAY WOKE UP AND FOUND NVIDIA SCUM HAD ATTACKED **THE** MACHINE WITH RANSOMWARE…….”

Screenshots from the publicly accessible Lapsus$ Telegram channel were shared on Twitter by multiple security researchers including Emsisoft threat analyst Brett Callow and cybersecurity enthusiast Soufiane Tahiri. It is unclear when exactly these messages were posted and Lapsus$’s Telegram channel was inaccessible Saturday afternoon due to the alleged posting of pornographic content Callow told CRN.

[Related: Nvidia Hack ‘Completely Compromised’ Internal Systems: Report]

Nvidia did not immediately respond to a CRN request for comment Saturday but said Friday “We are investigating an incident. Our business and commercial activities continue uninterrupted. We are still working to evaluate the nature and scope of the event.”

Lapsus$ said on Telegram that accessing the VPN of Nvidia employees requires a PC to be enrolled in mobile device management (MDM) according to screenshots posted to Twitter. For this reason Nvidia was able to connect to a virtual machine that Lapsus$ uses according to the ransomware operator.

Nvidia was able to successfully encrypt Lapsus$’s data but the ransomware group said it had a backup meaning that its data was “safe from scum!!!” Lapsus$ asserted that it wasn’t hacked by a competing ransomware group.

“LUCKILY IT HAD A BACKUP BUT WHY THE F*** THEY THINK THEY CAN CONNECT TO THE PRIVATE MACHINE AND INSTALL RANSOMWARE!!!!!!!!!!!” Lapsus$ posted on Telegram.

Hacking back is not common but has certainly happened before Callow told CRN. Dropping ransomware on an attacker’s network can prevent the ransomware group from leaking whatever victim data they exfiltrated according to Callow.

Prior to being hacked themselves the Lapsus$ ransomware group leaked the credentials of Nvidia employees and said they would soon release one terabyte of stolen data according to screenshots shared on Twitter by cybersecurity monitoring group DarkTracer. Lapsus$ claimed to have shared the password hashes from all Nvidia employees and said it would soon leak data about the RTX GPUS.

“We are not sure how we will leak the data yet” Lapsus$ wrote on Telegram according to screenshots shared early Saturday morning by DarkTracer. “We think it will be in 5 different releases its very large [sic].”

Lapsus$ said it would ensure Nvidia’s data isn’t leaked if the company contacted the ransomware group by email and paid an unspecified fee. Lapsus$ said it was expecting initial contact from Nvidia on or before Friday according to screenshots shared by DarkTracer.

The Lapsus$ ransomware gang is relatively new but just last month knocked the websites of one of Portugal’s biggest newspapers and of a major broadcaster offline according to The National. Both the newspaper and the website are owned by Portugal’s largest media conglomerate Impresa according to The National.

In December 2021 Lapsus$ allegedly hacked Brazil’s health ministry website and took several systems down including one with information about the national immunization program and another used to issue digital vaccination certificates according to The National.

It’s unclear where Lapsus$ is based or if they have links to other ransomware gangs Callow told CRN adding that there isn’t anything particularly unusual about the group.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzIvMjUvMjI5NTEzNzYvbnZpZGlhLWluY2lkZW50LWFsbGVnZWQtY3liZXJhdHRhY2stZmVicnVhcnktMjAyMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia confirms it's investigating an “incident” reportedly a huge cyberattack,"Nvidia is confirming to The Verge Bloomberg Reuters and others that it’s investigating an “incident” — hours after The Telegraph reported that the graphics chipmaking giant had experienced a devastating cyberattack that “completely compromised” the company’s internal systems over the past two days.

“We are investigating an incident. Our business and commercial activities continue uninterrupted. We are still working to evaluate the nature and scope of the event and don’t have any additional information to share at this time” reads a statement via Nvidia spokesman Hector Marinez.

Even The Telegraph’s sources aren’t suggesting that Nvidia has necessarily had any data stolen or deleted and there’s no current suggestion that the “incident” might be linked to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine though cyberattacks have been part of the offensive and internet infrastructure has also been a target there.

Bloomberg is now reporting it was a minor ransomware attack citing a “person familiar with the incident.”

Early Saturday morning the dark web intelligence firm DarkTracer tweeted that Lapsus$ a ransomware gang recently linked to an attack on Portugal’s largest TV channel has claimed responsibility leaking what it says are the password hashes for Nvidia employees and indicating it has other data including source code and information related to RTX GPUs. Soufiane Tahiri posted a later message from the group to Twitter where they claimed the company tried to delete their data in a virtual machine via the VPN and device management platform it uses. They apparently claim to still have a backup of the data that they are threatening to leak. There’s still no indication publicly that this is incident is tied to Russia’s invasion.

If a US-based company like Nvidia had been targeted though it could provoke retaliation from the United States. “If Russia pursues cyberattacks against our companies our critical infrastructure we’re prepared to respond” President Biden said during his Thursday address.

While the alleged attack reportedly knocked out Nvidia’s email we did receive Nvidia’s statement today from an Nvidia email address.

Nvidia also mysteriously asked press late Wednesday evening to push back a minor announcement that would have arrived on Thursday without providing an explanation. That timing lines up with when The Telegraph reports that Nvidia’s systems were compromised.

Update 5:47PM ET: Added that Bloomberg is now citing a source that the “incident” was a ransomware attack.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9udmlkaWEtYWxsZWdlZGx5LWhhY2tzLWhhY2tlcnMtd2hvLXN0b2xlLWNvbXBhbnlzLWRhdGHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia Allegedly Hacks Hackers Who Stole Company's Data,"Nvidia yesterday launched an investigation into a hacker group that stole over 1TB of the chipmaker's data. Underground group Vx-underground has shared on its Twitter account that Nvidia has reportedly retaliated by sneaking back into the hacker's system and encrypting the stolen data.

LAPSU$ an extortion group in South America had illegally tapped into Nvidia's mailing server and installed malware on the software distribution server. As a result the hacker group purportedly extracted over 1TB of Nvidia's data. However it's unknown what kind of data the hackers had stolen whether Nvidia's or its clients' data. Nvidia's spokesman didn't share any details other than the company was looking into the breach.

It would seem that Nvidia has identified the attackers. According to the Vx-underground's Twitter post and backed by screenshots the chipmaker has infected the perpetrators' system with ransomware and encrypted the stolen data in response to the attack. The group claimed that it had a backup of the data though.

It's not Nvidia's first time to the rodeo either. The chipmaker along with a list of big-name corporations including Intel was victim to the SolarWinds hack back in 2020.

Nonetheless it's not every day that you see companies take matters into their own hands as the majority of the victims hand the case over to the authorities. On the other hand Nvidia was allegedly more proactive and launched a cyberattack on hackers. Unfortunately if the group's claim to having a backup is valid Nvidia's effort may have been in vain.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAyLzI2L252aWRpYV9zZWN1cml0eV9icmVhY2gv0gFCaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tL0FNUC8yMDIyLzAyLzI2L252aWRpYV9zZWN1cml0eV9icmVhY2gv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Data stolen from Nvidia blueprints leak threatened,"In brief Nvidia is probing a cyberattack that caused outages within its internal network.

It's said that email and developer systems were knocked over during the intrusion which was discovered three days ago. The GPU giant continues to investigate.

In a statement an Nvidia spokesperson told The Register on Friday: ""Our business and commercial activities continue uninterrupted. We are still working to evaluate the nature and scope of the event and don't have any additional information to share at this time.""

A source speaking to Bloomberg described the security breach as relatively minor and said it was not connected to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

In an updated statement on February 28 Nvidia told us it does not believe ransomware was involved but that data was stolen from its network and leaked online: On February 23 2022 NVIDIA became aware of a cybersecurity incident which impacted IT resources. Shortly after discovering the incident we further hardened our network engaged cybersecurity incident response experts and notified law enforcement. We have no evidence of ransomware being deployed on the NVIDIA environment or that this is related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However we are aware that the threat actor took employee credentials and some NVIDIA proprietary information from our systems and has begun leaking it online. Our team is working to analyze that information. We do not anticipate any disruption to our business or our ability to serve our customers as a result of the incident. The LAPSUS$ cyber-extortion gang took credit for the intrusion and alleged it stole 1TB of schematics driver and firmware code documentation SDKs and more. The crew claimed it leaked a 19GB archive of those files online which includes what may be the source code to Nv's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) and other components. The crooks said unless Nvidia releases a software update that removes its recent crypto-coin mining limiter they will leak what sounds like internal hardware documents – a hw folder specifically. Curiously the gang is also selling what it claims to be a tool that removes the mining limiter.

Separately this week a Windows application called Nvidia RTX LHR v2 Unlocker was released that claimed to eliminate the mechanisms Nvidia put in place to hamper the mining of cryptocurrencies on graphics cards aimed at gamers.

Now the Red Panda Mining forum has issued an alert saying not only does the program not actually bypass Nvidia's mining limiter but on installation it infects the system with malware including a remote-control backdoor and code that extracts digital money stored on the machine.

Bottom line is don't install this application.

Anonymous says it's at war with Russia Conti threatens retaliation

As the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues two notorious internet bodies are picking sides.

On Thursday a Twitter account associated with the Anonymous collective declared it was urging members to attack Russian government and commercial websites in light of the occupation. It apologized to Russians caught up in the cyber-assaults and said President Putin's unprovoked military action could not be allowed to go unchecked.

""We as a collective want only peace in the world"" the Anons said. ""We want a future for all of humanity. So while people around the globe smash your internet providers to bits understand that it's entirely directed at the actions of the Russian government and Putin.""

Shortly afterwards the websites of Russian state-controlled channel RT and the state-owned Gazprom power company as well as some government sites disappeared offline. Anonymous claimed its people were behind the outages.

Then on Friday the Conti cyber-criminal gang which is based in Russia warned it too was stepping into the fray. Conti which was responsible for last year's crippling of the Irish Health Service via a ransomware attack said it did not support the war nor was it acting at the behest of the Russian government but would retaliate against any cyberwarfare by the West.

""As a response to Western warmongering and American threats to use cyber warfare against the citizens of Russian Federation the Conti Team is officially announcing that we will use our full capacity to deliver retaliatory measures in case the Western warmongers attempt to target critical infrastructure in Russia or any Russian-speaking region of the world"" it warned in a statement seen by El Reg.

The FCC America's communications watchdog is reportedly attempting to identify telecoms providers and other companies it oversees that have close ties to Russia in case a further crackdown on Moscow is needed following the invasion of Ukraine.

Ransomware attacks almost double and recovery rates are dropping

More bad news on the ransomware front this week with a couple of reports claiming global infection rates went up 92.7 per cent last year and that recovering from an attack – even if you pay up – is getting harder.

NCC Group released figures indicating a huge jump in the use of ransomware with America the top target at 53 per cent of monitored infections and Europe at 30 per cent. The top targets remain government organizations and the industrial sector which account for around 20 per cent each of the total.

""Many of the dangers which we first identified at the start of the pandemic have snowballed in 2021 revealing a developing threat landscape with ransomware attacks on the rise' said Matt Hull NCC's global lead for strategic threat intelligence.

And the news isn't good for those afflicted either. ID management house Venafi this week reported that 35 per cent of those that actually paid the ransom still couldn't get heir data back. In cases of double attacks when the public exposure of stolen data is threatened 18 per cent of those who paid still had their information leaked compared to 16 per cent who suffered a similar fate after refusing to pay the ransom.

Interestingly the report noted that 32 per cent of attacks were employing so-called triple attacks where the attackers use the purloined data to threaten suppliers and customers. Nearly two thirds of those surveyed said they would more likely pay up as a result of these extra threats.

America's number one... in value to criminals at least

An interesting analysis of adverts placed by access brokers who sell access to compromised systems has found Americans are still the top target although the UK is only just second in terms of monetary value.

After going through two years of cyber-crime forum postings the team at Crowdstrike noted that 55 per cent of ads were for US companies and individuals and they topped the cost chart with an average value of $3985 per system. The second most valuable nation was the UK at $3925 although it only accounted for 7 per cent of adverts.

Government institution access is the most expensive sector covered in the report with an average cost of $6151 closely followed by the finance industry. In some cases access brokers were charging five-figure sums for vital accounts.

""The academic sector has historically been a popular focus of ransomware operations with intrusions timed to coincide with the start of a new school term to cause the greatest disruption and in turn encourage a quick ransom payment"" the report states.

""Almost 40 per cent of the academic sector advertisements were for access to US-based institutions with a spike in activity noted in August 2021 that coincides with the start of the new semester.""

Low-tech cyber-fraudster admits crimes

A Nigerian credential-stuffer who managed to bilk HR departments out of around $800000 pleaded guilty this week to one count of computer fraud in the Southern District of New York.

Charles Onus 34 was arrested in 2021 in San Francisco on his way to Las Vegas after being accused of taking part in an organized campaign to target human resources and payroll staff to divert funds into other accounts. Rather than using high-level computer skills Onus and his pals took existing credentials leaked in past attacks and banked on staff reusing passwords and login data.

As any security professional will not be surprised to learn it was very successful. Onus admitted diverting around $800000 in purloined funds using the cracked work accounts at US companies from July 2017 to 2018.

""Charles Onus admitted to participating in a scheme to steal hundreds of thousands of hard-earned dollars from workers across the United States by hacking into a payroll company's system and diverting payroll deposits to prepaid debit cards he controlled"" said Damian Williams US Attorney for the Southern District of New York.

""Our office will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to zealously arrest and prosecute those who seek to commit cybercrimes targeting Americans from behind a keyboard abroad."" ®",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vaG90aGFyZHdhcmUuY29tL25ld3MvbGFwc3VzLWNsYWltcy1udmlkaWEtaGFja2VkLWJhY2stYWZ0ZXItaXRzLWF0dGFja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ransomware Group Lapsus Claims NVIDIA Hacked Back After Its Attack On The GPU Giant,"



Just yesterday we reported on The Telegraph's report claiming that NVIDIA had suffered a cyber-attack. NVIDIA didn't provide any details but the company's statement that it was ""investigating an incident"" was admission enough. As it stood last night it seemed clear something had happened but we didn't know whodunnit—or why.









Well now we do. Multiple sources on Twitter including cybersecurity monitoring group DarkTracer  are reporting that the relatively new Lapsus ransomware gang has taken responsibility for the hack. The group claims to have some 1TB of NVIDIA files and says that it will leak them to the web possibly in 5 separate releases if NVIDIA doesn't pay an unspecified sum ""on or before Friday.""





See groups like Lapsus make money by breaking into business networks and then extorting them for cash. Sometimes they steal data and hold it hostage as in this case and other times they drop ransomware and demand payment for the decryption key. It's very frustrating when you've been hacked not only because of the time and money lost but also because of the loss of face.









To prove the veracity of the data breach Lapsus has shown redacted screenshots of directory listings as well as hashed passwords and most convincingly a censored bit of proprietary source code shown above. And so it does appear on the surface that the hack is legit and it does appear that Lapsus is likely responsible. That's not the funny and ironic part of this story though.That's something Lapsus knows all about apparently now that the group claims they've been the target of a cyber-attack themselves. The image above shared on Twitter by cybersecurity enthusiast Soufiane Tahiri  has Lapsus complaining of a ransomware attack on their own systems—and they lay the blame directly at NVIDIA's feet.It's difficult to imagine a giant corporation like NVIDIA performing a ransomware attack on anyone but it's not hard to imagine a vindictive network admin striking back against the group that has been causing him so much stress over the last couple of days. Hilariously Lapsus says ""why [do] they think they can connect to our private machine and install ransomware!!!!"" Why indeed Lapsus."

For something that the entire world relies on the semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem is surprisingly constrained with only a few countries capable of designing or manufacturing them across the world.

To achieve economic efficiency companies across the semiconductor value chain use a variety of processes and technologies such as design fabrication and assembly. However most companies have not been able to gain 100% autonomy in having an end-to-end setup in the same geography which has led to shortage concerns during the recent lockdowns due to the pandemic. Scarcity of chips can cause production to suffer in almost every industry underlining the necessity to diversify chip supply. As the demand for chips grows semiconductor manufacturers have decided to expand their production facilities. Furthermore governments all around the world have been working on strategies to develop domestic chip production capability.

Asia Pacific is known as the world’s biggest market for semiconductors with China Japan South Korea and Taiwan spearheading the global market. However each country has different strengths and still rely on each other since the semiconductor value chain is long and involves many specialized fields: IP Design IC Design SoC development system design Equipment Electronic Design Automation software (EDA) Intellectual Property core (IP) Integrated Device Manufacturer (IDM and fabless) foundry and Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly & Test (OSAT).

Lessons that India could learn from other countries chipping in

China

The biggest strength of China is that it can scale any technology at a speed that no other economy can match up to. China also has a large share of the global market in OSAT and is now expanding on integrated circuit (IC) design. This is majorly due to the low labour and manufacturing costs and the progressive initiatives by the government. Indian government is very much on the same path and has recently launched similar initiatives to boost the semiconductor industry. However Chinese enterprises have become accustomed to investing in areas of technology that do not need extensive R&D and can potentially earn short-term returns and this has possibly hindered the growth of the semiconductor industry in China. Semiconductor devices with longer investment durations with ample time and money spent on R&D and design have a smaller market share in China and India could learn from this misstep to become an R&D-driven technology leader in years to come.

Taiwan

Taiwan has developed an atmosphere in which the semiconductor industry could thrive and earn an international reputation thanks to public policies such as subsidies tax breaks and public infrastructures such as the creation of major research and industrial parks. Over the years Taiwan has become very competitive in chip manufacturing and IC design and has the world’s biggest foundry and most advanced semiconductor manufacturing process technology. While the country’s semiconductor industry can still suppress continue to grow India can suppress Taiwan by creating a similar cluster of the right policies subsidies and infrastructure that they have created in a small geographical area for the growth of the semiconductor industry.

South Korea

South Korea has become the second largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world after US. The key competitive advantage of the South Korean semiconductor industry is in the production of memory semiconductors which it achieves by utilizing its low-cost workforce in the labor-intensive process of semiconductor manufacturing. Just like South Korea India too can create a massive industrial chain with every semiconductor factory being surrounded by a variety of supporting enterprises of layers of outsourcing and subcontracting.

Japan

Today most of the devices are produced in China Taiwan and South Korea putting Japan in the fourth spot. Japan’s strengths in semiconductors have always been in raw materials that have high requirements for purity equipment and small active-passive components. While Japan has been lagging they have recently announced the revival of the Japanese semiconductor sector as a national priority. Their existing semiconductor foundries will be upgraded to support the production of cutting-edge equipment such as processors and 5G networks. India too has similar favourable conditions for the raw materials required and with the recent government push the semiconductor industry in India can achieve similar heights.

How is India stepping up the ladder?

India like other countries across the world imports 100% of its chips from Taiwan Singapore Hong Kong Thailand and Vietnam. The Indian Government has started to make efforts to attract foreign companies to set up semiconductor manufacturing units in India. As part of the ‘Make in India’ initiative India is also finalizing plans to mass-produce semiconductor chips. Recently the government unveiled a Rs 76000-crore package for the development of India’s semiconductor and display manufacturing ecosystem including Rs 2.3 lakh crore in incentives to position India as a global hub for electronics manufacturing with semiconductors serving as the foundational building block.

Developing domestic semiconductor manufacturing capabilities will have a multiplier effect across different sectors of the economy and will contribute significantly to achieving a USD 1 trillion digital economy and a USD 5 trillion GDP by 2025. The initiative will not only boost semiconductor manufacturing but will also help India achieve self-sufficiency improve data security and gain digital independence.

The bottom line is that it is evident that India has the ability to design & manufacture its own semiconductors and establish an end-to-end supply chain within the country itself. India already has the right atmosphere which followed by strategic implementation of resources and government support might be a game changer for the country.

There were hundreds of custom cars classics hot rods trucks motorcycles and race cars on display a fantastic showing of true automotive art.

""It really is about a celebration of the American automotive history"" said Doc Riley. ""There's no stock vehicle here. It’s either been repainted or re-chromed or re-body modified that type of situation. You're going to see everything from a 1923 racing vehicle all the way up to an import car that does drifting to drag racing.""

For car builders like Quint Walberts shows like this allow him to show off years of hard work.

""It's rewarding when you can say you did even 90% by yourself or even 50% by yourself. Just to do anything yourself at all and then coming to an event like this and potentially winning something that’s really rewarding"" Walberts said.

He’s been working on cars since he was a teenager—a consistent theme for many of the car builders.

The California Council on Science and Technology had just revealed that the testing and treatment of hazardous chemicals in oil field wastewater used for irrigation was inadequate and legislators were demanding increased oversight. They feared that oil companies’ wastewater was threatening groundwater needed for drinking water and growing crops.

Faced with heightened scrutiny the California’s Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board raced to secure a consultant to study the controversial practice and soon settled on GSI Environmental as both qualified and unbiased.

Last fall armed with GSI’s completed studies the board tried to put concerns about the practice to rest assuring the public that the firm had found “no identifiable increased health risks” from irrigating crops with water recycled from oil wells.

But the board should never have chosen GSI scientists public interest activists and former regulators said in interviews citing the firm’s close ties to the oil industry—ties so close that GSI once listed on its website Chevron ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum as clients “we answer to.”

Chevron is the largest producer of oil field wastewater for irrigation in California. The company saves millions of dollars in disposal costs by selling the “produced water” to a local water district which in turn sells it to farmers in Kern County to irrigate their water-intensive almonds pistachios and citrus.

When the water board retained GSI the firm had already earned millions of dollars helping Chevron defend its interests in a single court case.

In addition to Chevron GSI had also helped other corporate polluters defend themselves against claims of environmental and health harms by providing litigation support and expert witness testimony documents filed in state and federal courts show.

Beyond its legal defense services GSI regularly takes research funds from the chemical and fossil fuel industries and collaborates on research with scientists who work for these industries a review of the scientific literature shows.

And it has published commentaries that cast doubt on evidence that oil and gas extraction or chemical industry products cause harm without disclosing its litigation support for these industries or its industry funding as a conflict of interest.

Robert Scofield who led the work for GSI said in a statement via email to Inside Climate News that his firm performed the studies in “the most technically sound manner.”

Despite the water board’s public assurances about food safety experts say GSI’s studies do not provide sufficient evidence to support those claims. And the board’s own Food Safety Expert Panel concluded that the studies could not answer fundamental safety questions about irrigating crops with water recycled from oil wells.

Defending Chevron in Court

GSI Environmental a Houston-based firm with California offices has a long history of working for oil companies and the law firms that defend them.

In 2010 John Connor president of GSI took the stand in a Mississippi circuit court on behalf of Chevron. He had come to defend the oil giant against five women from Fayette—a town whose residents are predominantly poor and Black—who blamed Chevron for their children’s health and intellectual disabilities.

The women had worked in a building converted from a gas station that their lawyers tied to Texaco bought by Chevron in 2001. They believed leaded gas fumes from storage tanks left underground had seeped into the building while they were pregnant and caused their children’s disabilities.

Connor testified that a gas station across the street was to blame. But the women’s lawyers offered proof that there had never been a gas station across the street. Three days after Connor’s testimony a jury awarded the women $19 million.

During the trial Connor acknowledged that between 2000 and 2010 Chevron paid his firm nearly $8 million documents filed with the Circuit Court of Jefferson County show. Between 2004 and 2008 GSI received roughly $5 million for what Connor testified was “a major undertaking” for Chevron’s defense against Indigenous Ecuadoreans seeking damages from Texaco for allegedly dumping billions of gallons of produced water in the rainforest.

Connor had been tapped as a lead expert witness for Chevron by the international law firm King & Spalding which also defends the tobacco industry.

“There’s a sense that if someone has done work for one party that they’re somehow beholden to that party but it’s not really the case” Connor said. “In our case we work for all kinds of different companies. And we don’t take on the mantle of any of those companies.”

Connor estimated that litigation support accounts for about 30 percent of GSI’s business. “Some of it’s been for government” he said. “A lot of it’s for industry on their problems.”

The water board had determined that GSI did not appear to have a bias “that would be unacceptable.” A simple Google search reveals Connor’s public testimony about GSI’s work for Chevron in Ecuador.

The water board had required proposed consultants to “execute” a disclosure statement in an agreement between the board and the oil companies and water districts it regulates. But neither the board nor GSI could find a copy of a completed statement. Connor said the board never sent it.

Clay Rodgers the official in charge of the water control board’s food safety review said he had no proof of sending it but if he didn’t it was likely a simple oversight. “We reviewed GSI’s background extensively” Rodgers said “noting that they had done some work for oil companies in the past.”

Rodgers said he was not aware of GSI’s expert witness and litigation support for the oil industry.

Scofield GSI’s lead on the project told a water board official that he could not find a disclosure statement in the firm’s files in an email obtained by Inside Climate News. Scofield also told the water board official that GSI met the board’s criteria. “Specifically we ‘possess the experience expertise and impartiality necessary to ensure the quality of the Study’” Scofield wrote paraphrasing the board’s requirements for a consultant. Chevron representative Jonathan Harshman said the water board chose a consultant based on the firm’s qualifications and integrity. The water board staff found GSI Environmental “to be well qualified and unbiased in their approach” said Harshman communications advisor for Chevron’s San Joaquin Valley Business Unit.

Successful highly qualified consulting firms work for a multitude of companies said Rodgers who worked nearly two decades in private consulting himself. The board took steps to limit contact between GSI and the oil districts and water districts that paid their fees he said adding that it would have been “almost impossible” to find a consultant that did no work for oil companies but had the expertise needed for this type of project.

“You’re going to disqualify perhaps most of the highly qualified folks if you say you can never have done any work for an oil company” he said.

“That’s the problem in a nutshell” said Benjamin Franta a doctoral candidate at Stanford University where he studies the behavior of the fossil fuel industry. “When conflicts of interest become so pervasive that they become normalized and there’s no alternative that’s a problem.”

Industry Influence on the Panel

The Central Valley water board convened its expert panel in 2015 to make sure it wasn’t missing potential health harms from growing crops with produced water. Two experts on the nine-member panel had ties to the oil industry. One expert had worked for the consulting firm ERM whose clients included a California spinoff of Occidental Petroleum California Resources Corporation or CRC.

Another was nominated by Chevron which initially paid for her participation. Mark Bradford who joined the seven-member water board three years after the panel was formed had long worked for ERM when he was appointed to the board by former Gov. Jerry Brown. Bradford now chairs the water board.

At the Food Safety Panel’s first public meeting in 2016 Mark Jones a panel member then working for the consulting firm ERM presented a study sponsored by Occidental spinoff CRC a provider of produced water.

Jones who based his study on CRC data from its Kern Front oil field assured the panel that produced water from the company’s oil field fell below levels of concern for every chemical analyzed in every crop tested.

But Jones had looked for just a fraction of the chemicals that might be in the crops. When a public health scientist on the panel Seth Shonkoff asked Jones if he thought his data accurately reflected what was in the wastewater water coming from the oil fields Jones acknowledged he didn’t know.

Soon after it became clear that Jones worked as a paid consultant for the oil industry a coalition of public interest organizations urged the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board to require panel members to disclose conflict of interests on forms made public.

The board declined explaining in a letter that it was unnecessary because panel members had been asked to “base their scientific conclusions on an objective assessment of all relevant evidence” rather than voice the views of their affiliated organizations. In any event the board wrote Jones is no longer employed by ERM.

The groups made another appeal for disclosure in June 2017 after learning that a second panel member Barbara Petersen had been nominated by Chevron. Petersen works for Exponent which also consults for oil and gas companies.

Chevron funded her participation through much of the first year then her position was funded by CalFLOWS through at least May 2017. CalFLOWS is a tax-exempt coalition of business farming and energy interests concerned about the state’s water future. Its board of directors includes representatives of Chevron CRC and another supplier of produced water Aera Energy.

Petersen did not respond to several requests for comment. Jones who now works for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said through an agency spokeswoman that he did not feel comfortable talking about his role with the panel because he no longer works on the project.

Months after public interest groups again raised their concerns about the expert panel’s makeup they still had seen no response from the board Bill Allayaud California government affairs director for the Environmental Working Group a nonprofit environmental advocacy organization said at a public meeting. “Is there a response to that yet?” he asked Rodgers.

We’re hiring! Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. See jobs

“We did look at what we considered viable potential conflicts of panel members” Rodgers replied explaining that the board wanted a group that represented all the stakeholders.

“I had a lot of complaints about Dr. Shonkoff being part of the panel that he was biased in his approach” Rodgers added at the meeting referring to Seth Shonkoff executive director of Physicians Scientists and Engineers (PSE) for Healthy Energy a nonprofit research institute. “My comment was ‘I need a panel that represents everybody. I want Dr. Shonkoff on the panel because he represents a different view.’”

Asked later in an interview who had complained about Shonkoff Rodgers declined to tell Inside Climate News.

Western States Petroleum Association or WSPA which lobbies on behalf of Chevron Exxon and other oil giants paid Exponent and ERM $169000 between 2016 and 2020 for consulting and other unspecified services campaign finance disclosures show.

Shonkoff said he told the board early on that it was of the “utmost importance” that advisory boards fill out conflict of interest forms. There should be a transparent process that reveals who has a stake in the project’s outcome he said. “We did not go through that process.”

Shonkoff himself was approached by the Environmental Defense Fund which wanted to pay for his time on the panel. He felt being funded by an environmental advocacy group would be inappropriate and turned down the offer.

“Scientific knowledge generation should not be conducted by a stakeholder group” said Shonkoff the only panel member who had published several peer-reviewed studies on the public health effects of oil and gas operations. “It needs to be independent.”

Turning Waste into a Resource

Produced water is the oil and gas industry’s largest waste stream across the country.

Regulators don’t track what California oil companies pay to dispose of it. But Eric Hoek a professor of engineering at the University of California Los Angeles said costs range from about 10 cents a barrel for on-site disposal to as much as $15 a barrel to truck it to a permitted disposal well.

For an industry that disposes of more than 700 million barrels of wastewater each year—about 29.4 billion gallons—disposal is a costly proposition. Chevron can save more than half a million dollars a year by selling its wastewater to a local water district.

That’s why Chevron forged a deal with the Cawelo Water District north of its Kern River Oil Field in the mid-1990s. Chevron saw an opportunity to reduce disposal costs and Cawelo welcomed an alternative water source for farmers in one of the state’s driest agricultural regions.

Farmers in Kern County the center of California’s oil industry use about 36000 acre-feet of produced water a year to grow mostly water-intensive almonds pistachios and citrus. That’s nearly 12 billion gallons or enough to cover about 36000 football fields with a foot of water. Chevron supplies nearly two-thirds of farmers’ produced water in California.

At the first public meeting Cawlelo’s general manager David Ansolabehere said the district pays as much as $170 an acre-foot to pump groundwater and up to $200 an acre-foot for surface water—that is when it’s available. In contrast the district pays just $30 an acre-foot for produced water providing an incentive to expand the practice.

To ensure continued access to a cheap reliable water source the district hired its own consultant Enviro-Tox to analyze crops just as the Food Safety Project got underway. The district also hired a PR firm to help field media inquiries from around the world said Ansolabehere.

The firm Fiona Hutton & Associates also handles public relations for WSPA the oil industry trade group.

WSPA spent nearly $9 million to lobby state politicians and regulators in 2014 when California tightened rules on produced water and more than $2 million in the last quarter of 2016 when WSPA lobbyists approached the Central Valley Water Board and other regulators about “food safety for produced water for agriculture.”

The Central Valley water board took over Cawelo’s testing program Ansolabehere noted in a 2019 memo to “eliminate a potential perceived conflict of interest with Cawelo managing the food safety analysis process.”

The board also turned down Cawelo’s suggestion to use its consultant for the Food Safety Project studies concerned that Enviro-Tox’s previous work for oil companies presented a conflict said Jessica Jahr counsel for the State Water Resources Control Board.

Instead Cawelo proposed GSI Environmental.

“We Answer to Them”

Ansolabehere said he recommended GSI because they’d done similar work in the past and could “perform the work in the time allotted.”

GSI’s Scofield asked if he had disclosed his firm’s work for the oil industry including providing expert testimony in court replied by email: “The organizations to whom we have provided our scientific consulting services are identified on our web page and are available to all parties.”

Told there is no list of clients on GSI’s website he acknowledged that the current site does not identify clients and that there appear to be no live links to past web pages that did.

The Internet Archive does provide those links. On a 2010 page promoting its services under the heading WE ANSWER TO THEM Chevron tops the list of industrial clients followed by ExxonMobil Monsanto Halliburton Schlumberger Occidental Petroleum and BASF.

“Oil companies are companies that have environmental problems” said GSI’s Connor. “That’s what we work on so we work for them.”

A lot of people in the scientific community work for different parties Connor said. “It’s not expected that you’re going to say ‘Hey I worked for this one company so my opinion is colored by that.’”

Connor said he’s aware of concerns of bias around consulting for pharmaceutical companies. “But that’s not a consideration in our business” he said. “Everybody that does what we do works for a lot of different companies.”

There’s abundant evidence that industry involvement in research tends to produce findings that favor the sponsor’s product said Lisa Bero professor of medicine and public health and chief scientist at the University of Colorado’s Center for Bioethics and Humanities. This so-called funding effect has been documented in the tobacco chemical drug food and fossil fuel industries among others.

“I think most people are not even aware there are consulting firms that are hired by big companies to basically do science for hire” said Stanford’s Franta.

If a firm has a history of working with an industry with a vested interest in the outcome of an enterprise or has any current or prospective future financial interest in that industry—such as revenues from consulting work—that’s a conflict of interest he said.

“If you worked for them in the past it stands to reason that you might work for them again and that’s an ongoing interest” he said. “That’s why even past work should be disclosed.”

The business model of these types of “product defense” consulting firms is to produce reports that polluting corporations can use to slow regulation or win court cases said David Michaels a George Washington University professor of environmental and occupational health and former head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

“These firms only write reports that are in the interests of their corporate clients” said Michaels whose book “Triumph of Doubt” details how regulated industries manufacture scientific uncertainty to protect their bottom line. If their reports found their client’s product was dangerous he added “they’d lose business.”

“Bent” Science

Several years ago Wayne Landis an expert in ecological risk assessment at Western Washington University set out to evaluate the sustainability of hydraulic fracturing with his student MariAnna Lane.

When they dug into the technical literature they didn’t find much research. And much of what they did find was “severely bent” said Landis referring to a strategy described in the book “Bending Science: How Special Interests Corrupt Public Health Research.”

Science is “bent” when it is “willfully manipulated to serve a predetermined policy goal” Landis and Lane explained in their chapter for the 2016 book Environmental and Health Issues in Unconventional Oil and Gas. Industries often deploy the strategy to deflect blame and liability though Landis and Lane found examples in government academia and nongovernmental organizations as well.

The pair encountered different degrees of bending science Landis said in an interview but one group stood out as an “excellent example”: GSI Environmental.

GSI’s Connor and his colleagues published papers on the source of methane contamination of groundwater in a poor rural region of northeastern Pennsylvania where dozens of families had sued Cabot Oil & Gas claiming its drilling polluted their wells. GSI coauthored the papers with Cabot Oil & Gas scientists and thanked the company one of the biggest drillers in the Marcellus Shale for permission to publish their data.

The studies concluded that methane contamination was a natural feature of the region’s geology unrelated to fracking.

That GSI absolved fracking of responsibility for contaminating groundwater might not have seemed suspect Landis and Lane wrote in their chapter if it hadn’t also attacked contrary research that did implicate fracking using inflammatory language not typically found in scientific discourse.

It’s common for scientists to critique papers using precise terms that dissect the methods and data analysis. They don’t use loaded language he said in the interview like calling harmful findings “allegations” as GSI did on its web site.

“Mr. Landis incorrectly criticized peer-reviewed publications by two GSI staff members” Connor wrote in an email. “Mr. Landis is not an expert in the scientific topics of these publications and it does not appear that he reviewed the technical content of the papers.”

That reply is actually bending science Landis said. “We had very specific criteria” he said which laid out the kinds of terminology used when someone intentionally bends science.

Landis said the fact that Connor attacked his technical expertise but not his evaluation of the language as evidence of bending science is telling. His response Landis said “was bolstering this case that it was bending science.”

In an interview Connor said that researchers who had linked fracking to groundwater contamination wouldn’t release their data. In fact the scientists had an agreement with homeowners to protect the address of their wells and released the data in a way that retained their privacy.

Last July Physicians for Social Responsibility or PSR reported that Chevron ExxonMobil and other major oil and gas companies had used toxic chemicals called PFAS in more than 1200 wells in six states. Scientists have linked the perfluorinated compounds dubbed “forever chemicals” because they don’t break down to developmental delays thyroid disease impaired immune function cancer and other serious health problems.

After a flurry of national stories about the report GSI Environmental scientists led by Connor posted a critique on the firm’s web site.

“We find that this article presents an inaccurate and exaggerated picture of the use of PFAS in hydraulic fracturing and the risks posed to public health and the environment” Connor and his GSI colleagues wrote.

They listed eight reasons why readers should not believe PSR’s report and noted in a news release that GSI received “no third-party funding” for the critique.

The same year GSI did acknowledge funding from the FluoroCouncil PFAS-manufacturers’ trade group to publish a framework to assess the chemicals’ toxicity. The FluoroCouncil promotes the claim contrary to independent research that new “short chain” compounds are safer than their “long chain” counterparts PFOA and PFOS which have been phased out due to concerns about their human health and environmental risks.

Connor said he had nothing to do with the FluoroCouncil project so it wouldn’t have been on his mind. And when a firm works for a lot of different companies it’s not expected to disclose funding for just doing a “project” he said. “That’s not how it’s done. It doesn’t represent any type of failure to disclose.”

Furthermore he added the GSI paper had nothing to do with whether PFAS was dangerous or safe which is a FluoroCouncil issue but whether it was in fracking fluid. “I wouldn’t say that was a failure to disclose” Connor said “because it’s about the use of that material in the oil industry.”

Yet Linda Birnbaum former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and an expert on the substances read the GSI critique as a dismissal of public health concerns around most PFAS. She said the firm claimed the public health concerns PSR described apply only to the most well-known compounds PFOA and PFOS not to other fluorinated compounds.

“That’s just not true” Birnbaum said.

Meanwhile the water board entrusted a consulting firm that has defended the oil industry against high-stakes claims of environmental and health harms to conduct unbiased studies in the public interest. Had the board asked about the firm’s work for oil companies—the ones it once listed on its web site—it may have considered alternatives.

There are many many other kinds of organizations that could be neutral parties that really are neutral and do the type of research that informs policy Landis said.

That’s a role universities and especially the state universities and land grant universities that are used to doing applied work can play he said. “There was no need to go to an industry stalwart.”

MIAMI – The Old Dominion women's basketball team used a hot start from the field to down FIU 81-69 on Saturday. The Monarchs (22-6 12-4 C-USA) shot over 50 percent in the first half and led by 17 at the break.



""We had our sights set on setting the tone"" head coach DeLisha Milton-Jones said. ""We were able to get to some things early based on how aggressive they were defensively and we shot well. We had some lulls here and there and their bench came in and produced in a major way. But we were able to weather the storm and still come away with a solid win.""



Iggy Allen scored 23 points on 7-of-12 shooting with four rebounds and a season-high four steals. The native of Pompano Beach Florida made a pair of 3-pointers and went 7-of-8 from the foul line. Allen was joined in double figures by Ajah Wayne (19) Amari Young (12) and Mariah Adams (10) and both Young and Wayne fell one rebound short of a double-double.



ODU made eight of 18 shot attempts in the first quarter and led 17-13 after 10 minutes. Young scored the first six points of the game for the Monarchs before passing the baton over the Allen who laid it in then sank a 3-pointer to give ODU an 11-3 lead. Another Allen basket made it a 17-10 game with 3:56 left in the quarter but Old Dominion failed to score another point in the frame.



The Monarchs found another gear in the second quarter shooting 12-of-19 (.632) and making three of five attempts from downtown. Allen scored nine points in the second and Wayne chipped in seven. That tandem scored the first 12 points of the second for ODU. An Allen jumper gave the Monarchs their first double-digit edge at 27-16 with 7:17 left in the half. After an Emerald Ekpiteta layup made it a nine-point margin Wayne scored a layup to push the lead to double figures again where it would stay until late in the fourth. Kaylen Nelson gave the Monarchs their largest lead of the game at 44-25 with a 3-pointer with 80 seconds left in the half. Nelson scored again with 18 seconds to play to send Old Dominion into the break at 46-29.



FIU (12-15 4-12) shaved a point off the deficit in the third as ODU went into the final period up 63-48. The Panthers made a greater push in the fourth getting to within seven at 71-64 with 1:43 to play but the Monarchs kept their composure and made eight free throws in a row over the last 1:13 to keep FIU at bay.



ODU led 67-48 less than a minute into the fourth following a layup and two free throws from Young but the Panthers responded with a 16-4 run. Ekpiteta capped the run with a layup that made the score 71-64. Allen broke the run with a layup then scored six straight from the foul line to restore ODU's double-digit lead.



For the game the Monarchs went to the foul line 17 times and made 15. The 88.2 percent mark from the foul line is ODU's best this season. Adams was 4-for-4 from the line and both Young and Wayne made two foul shots without a miss.



Adams recorded six assists on Saturday and turned the ball over just once. She now has 15 assists and one turnover in her last two games.



The Monarchs return to Chartway Arena for their final home game this Wednesday against LA Tech. Game time is set for 6:30 p.m. ODU then wraps up the regular season at Middle Tennessee on Saturday.

Herndon Caboose Park a popular railroad site along the Washington and Old Dominion Trail has unveiled an historical placard Saturday that describes Virginia’s segregated past on the railroad.

NOVA Parks unveiled the new sign in front of the historic site in Herndon which is visited by more than two million people every year. The new marker remembers Virginia’s segregation laws that discriminated against thousands of Blacks traveling on the railroad.

“Just coming down this trail you see this and you get a nostalgic romantic view. You know ‘riding the rails’” said Fairfax County NAACP President Karen Campblin of the large red caboose. “And you don’t understand the harsh treatment and environment others were put in while this romantic era was going on.”

The sign tells the story of how Virginia’s legislature enacted strict segregation codes for the railroads in 1900.

The restrictions a part of that era’s Jim Crow laws were designed to give white riders preferential treatment by seating Blacks and Native American passengers in other cars mainly in the rear of the train. The laws also required that Blacks wait for their trains in smaller segregated rooms at the station.

Despite many lawsuits against Jim Crow codes many of them stayed intact across Virginia until the late 1960s the plaque notes.

Campblin said the sign is meant to preserve African-American history and provoke a desire in visitors to learn more.

“It gives just enough information to give a person a spark to do more research” she said.

The Herndon Caboose sign is one of three unveiled in Northern Virginia this month. The authority has unveiled two similar signs in Loudoun and Arlington Counties.

NOVA Parks owns and manages the W&OD Trail which runs 45 miles between Shirlington and Purcellville on the rail’s old roadbed.

The W&OD railroad stopped operating in 1968. Some visitors at this weekend’s event hope the signs will have a significant impact on younger generations.

“When they stop and read the signs they will be surprised by this history” said Russell Baskett a former teacher who attended the event. “The more of this we can do the better.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vb2R1c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDIvMjYvbm8tNDUtbWVucy10ZW5uaXMtc3dlZXBzLWZ1cm1hbi10by1zdGFydC13ZWVrZW5k0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,No. 45 Men's Tennis Sweeps Furman To Start Weekend,"NORFOLK Va. – In a battle of nationally-ranked men's tennis teams on Saturday the 45th ranked Old Dominion Monarchs pulled a 4-0 win over 60th ranked Furman at the Folkes-Stevens Tennis Center.

For something that the entire world relies on the semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem is surprisingly constrained with only a few countries capable of designing or manufacturing them across the world.

To achieve economic efficiency companies across the semiconductor value chain use a variety of processes and technologies such as design fabrication and assembly. However most companies have not been able to gain 100% autonomy in having an end-to-end setup in the same geography which has led to shortage concerns during the recent lockdowns due to the pandemic. Scarcity of chips can cause production to suffer in almost every industry underlining the necessity to diversify chip supply. As the demand for chips grows semiconductor manufacturers have decided to expand their production facilities. Furthermore governments all around the world have been working on strategies to develop domestic chip production capability.

Asia Pacific is known as the world’s biggest market for semiconductors with China Japan South Korea and Taiwan spearheading the global market. However each country has different strengths and still rely on each other since the semiconductor value chain is long and involves many specialized fields: IP Design IC Design SoC development system design Equipment Electronic Design Automation software (EDA) Intellectual Property core (IP) Integrated Device Manufacturer (IDM and fabless) foundry and Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly & Test (OSAT).

Lessons that India could learn from other countries chipping in

China

The biggest strength of China is that it can scale any technology at a speed that no other economy can match up to. China also has a large share of the global market in OSAT and is now expanding on integrated circuit (IC) design. This is majorly due to the low labour and manufacturing costs and the progressive initiatives by the government. Indian government is very much on the same path and has recently launched similar initiatives to boost the semiconductor industry. However Chinese enterprises have become accustomed to investing in areas of technology that do not need extensive R&D and can potentially earn short-term returns and this has possibly hindered the growth of the semiconductor industry in China. Semiconductor devices with longer investment durations with ample time and money spent on R&D and design have a smaller market share in China and India could learn from this misstep to become an R&D-driven technology leader in years to come.

Taiwan

Taiwan has developed an atmosphere in which the semiconductor industry could thrive and earn an international reputation thanks to public policies such as subsidies tax breaks and public infrastructures such as the creation of major research and industrial parks. Over the years Taiwan has become very competitive in chip manufacturing and IC design and has the world’s biggest foundry and most advanced semiconductor manufacturing process technology. While the country’s semiconductor industry can still suppress continue to grow India can suppress Taiwan by creating a similar cluster of the right policies subsidies and infrastructure that they have created in a small geographical area for the growth of the semiconductor industry.

South Korea

South Korea has become the second largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world after US. The key competitive advantage of the South Korean semiconductor industry is in the production of memory semiconductors which it achieves by utilizing its low-cost workforce in the labor-intensive process of semiconductor manufacturing. Just like South Korea India too can create a massive industrial chain with every semiconductor factory being surrounded by a variety of supporting enterprises of layers of outsourcing and subcontracting.

Japan

Today most of the devices are produced in China Taiwan and South Korea putting Japan in the fourth spot. Japan’s strengths in semiconductors have always been in raw materials that have high requirements for purity equipment and small active-passive components. While Japan has been lagging they have recently announced the revival of the Japanese semiconductor sector as a national priority. Their existing semiconductor foundries will be upgraded to support the production of cutting-edge equipment such as processors and 5G networks. India too has similar favourable conditions for the raw materials required and with the recent government push the semiconductor industry in India can achieve similar heights.

How is India stepping up the ladder?

India like other countries across the world imports 100% of its chips from Taiwan Singapore Hong Kong Thailand and Vietnam. The Indian Government has started to make efforts to attract foreign companies to set up semiconductor manufacturing units in India. As part of the ‘Make in India’ initiative India is also finalizing plans to mass-produce semiconductor chips. Recently the government unveiled a Rs 76000-crore package for the development of India’s semiconductor and display manufacturing ecosystem including Rs 2.3 lakh crore in incentives to position India as a global hub for electronics manufacturing with semiconductors serving as the foundational building block.

Developing domestic semiconductor manufacturing capabilities will have a multiplier effect across different sectors of the economy and will contribute significantly to achieving a USD 1 trillion digital economy and a USD 5 trillion GDP by 2025. The initiative will not only boost semiconductor manufacturing but will also help India achieve self-sufficiency improve data security and gain digital independence.

The bottom line is that it is evident that India has the ability to design & manufacture its own semiconductors and establish an end-to-end supply chain within the country itself. India already has the right atmosphere which followed by strategic implementation of resources and government support might be a game changer for the country.

The Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST President Seok Jin Yoon) announced that the research team led by Dr. Sung Jong Yoo of the Hydrogen Fuel Cell Research Center has succeeded in synthesizing nanoparticles by a physical method rather than the existing chemical reactions by using the sputtering technology which is a thin metal film deposition technology used in semiconductor manufacturing.

Metal nanoparticles have been studied in various fields over the past few decades. Recently metal nanoparticles have been attracting attention as a critical catalyst for hydrogen fuel cells and water electrolysis systems to produce hydrogen. Metal nanoparticles are mainly prepared through complex chemical reactions. In addition they are prepared using organic substances harmful to the environment and humans. Therefore additional costs are inevitably incurred for their treatment and the synthesis conditions are challenging. Therefore a new nanoparticle synthesis method that can overcome the shortcomings of the existing chemical synthesis is required to establish the hydrogen energy regime.

The sputtering process applied by the KIST research team is a technology that coats a thin metal film during the semiconductor manufacturing process. In this process plasma is used to cut large metals into nanoparticles which are then deposited on a substrate to form a thin film. The research team prepared nanoparticles using 'glucose' a special substrate that prevented the transformation of the metal nanoparticles to a thin film by using plasma during the process. The synthesis method used the principle of physical vapor deposition using plasma rather than chemical reactions. Therefore metal nanoparticles could be synthesized using this simple method overcoming the limitations of the existing chemical synthesis methods.

The development of new catalysts has been hindered because the existing chemical synthesis methods limited the types of metals that could be used as nanoparticles. In addition the synthesis conditions must be changed depending on the type of metal. However it has become possible to synthesize nanoparticles of more diverse metals through the developed synthesis method. In addition if this technology is simultaneously applied to two or more metals alloy nanoparticles of various compositions can be synthesized. This would lead to the development of high-performance nanoparticle catalysts based on alloys of various compositions.

The KIST research team synthesized a platinum-cobalt-vanadium alloy nanoparticle catalyst using this technology and applied for the oxygen reduction reaction in hydrogen fuel cell electrodes. As a result the catalyst activity was 7 and 3 times higher than those of platinum and platinum-cobalt alloy catalysts that are commercially used as catalysts for hydrogen fuel cells respectively. Furthermore the researchers investigated the effect of the newly added vanadium on other metals in the nanoparticles. They found that vanadium improved the catalyst performance by optimizing the platinum–oxygen bonding energy through computer simulation.

Dr. Sung Jong Yoo of KIST commented “Through this research we have developed a synthesis method based on a novel concept which can be applied to research focused on metal nanoparticles toward the development of water electrolysis systems solar cells petrochemicals.”. He added “We will strive to establish a complete hydrogen economy and develop carbon-neutral technology by applying alloy nanoparticles with new structures which has been difficult to implement to development eco-friendly energy technologies including hydrogen fuel cells.”

Korea Institute of Science and Technology(KIST)  founded as the first multidisciplinary government-funded research institute in Korea established a national development strategy based on science and technology and disseminated various essential industrial technologies. Now half a century later KIST is elevating Korea's status in the field of science and technology through world-leading fundamental technology R&D. Looking to the future KIST will continue to strive to be a premier research institute pursuing a brighter future of human.

This research was carried out as a major project of KIST a technology development program to solve climate change and a nanomaterial technology development program of the National Research Foundation of Korea with the support of the Ministry of Science and ICT (Minister Hyesook Lim). The study results were published in the latest issue of 'Nano Today' (IF: 20.722 top 4.25% in JCR) an international scientific journal in the field of nanoparticles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9uZXdzLzkzNTcwLWludGVsLWFtZC1zdG9wLWluZHVzdHJpYWwtY2hpcC1zYWxlcy1ydXNzaWEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel and AMD stop industrial chip sales to Russia,"What just happened? In compliance with recent trade restrictions that block the supply of high-tech processors to Ukraine Intel and AMD have reportedly suspended deliveries of their chips to Russia. These restrictions are part of the ongoing trade sanctions implemented by the US government following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

A report from RBC claims that Intel and AMD two of the largest US semiconductor manufacturers have informed their Russian partners that they would be stopping industrial chip deliveries to the country. However these restrictions will not affect the supply chain for consumer-targeted products such as laptop and desktop processors.

""The company is closely monitoring the situation and is enforcing applicable sanctions and export control rules including new sanctions imposed by OFAC and rules issued by BIS"" said an Intel spokesperson in Russia.

The ban on semiconductor exports doesn't start until March 3. However RBC's sources state that Intel and AMD have already verbally informed Russian buyers that they have already canceled all processor shipments. The sanctions may lead to an immediate shortage of the necessary equipment for running servers and high-tech equipment used across industries including aviation banking and space exploration.

This ban could result in losses to Russian corporations and government institutions many of whom rely on foreign semiconductor designs to run essential systems. While Russia has announced its intention to substitute foreign-made hardware for its own these efforts have not panned out. The Elbrus-8C a Russian-designed CPU failed to pass recent industrial stress tests.

In addition to the economic ramifications these trade restrictions may weaken Russia's cyberwarfare capabilities. In addition to recent action against Ukraine Russian hackers have been tied to cyberattacks committed on the United States France Poland Germany and South Korea including a major attack on the 2018 Winter Olympics.

There is growing pressure for US companies to restrict their products and services in Russia. Meta Google and Twitter recently announced restrictions on Russian state media that prohibit them from creating ads or monetizing content.

Ukraine's Vice Prime Minister tweeted at Apple CEO Tim Cook on Friday urging him to block the Apple App Store for citizens of the Russian Federation. Apple has not publicly commented on the request.

Even Taiwan-based TSMC one of the largest manufacturers of semiconductors globally stated that they would comply with export control rules on Russia. Once the ban is in full swing Russia will have to look for other sources for its semiconductor supply chain such as China.

It seems that a significant percentage of the world’s neon gas is produced in Ukrainian factories and there is concern among pundits and electronics manufacturers that a disruption of this supply could be a further problem for an industry already reeling from the COVID-related chip shortage. It’s thus worth taking a quick look at the neon business from an engineering perspective to perhaps make sense of some of those concerns.

As most readers will know from their high school chemistry lessons neon is one of the so-called inert gasses sitting in the column at the extreme right of the Periodic table. It occurs in nature as a small percentage of the air we breathe and is extracted from the air by fractional distillation of the liquid phase. The important point from the above sentences is that the same neon is all around us in the air as there is in Ukraine in other words there is no strategic neon mine in the Ukrainian countryside about to be overrun by the Russian invaders.

So why do we source so much neon from Ukraine if we’re constantly breathing the stuff in and out everywhere else in the world? Since the air separation industry is alive and well worldwide for the production of liquid nitrogen and oxygen as well as the slightly more numerous inert gasses we’re guessing that the answer lies in economics. It’s a bit harder to extract neon from air than it is argon because there is less of it in the air. Since it can be brought for a reasonable cost from the Ukrainians who have made it their business to extract it there is little benefit in American or Western European companies trying to compete. Our take is that if the supply of Ukrainian neon is interrupted there may be a short period of neon scarcity. After that air extraction companies will quite speedily install whatever extra plant they need in order to service the demand. If that’s your area of expertise we’d love to hear from you in the comments.

Here at Hackaday we are saddened beyond words at what has happened in Ukraine and we hope our Ukrainian readers and those Ukrainian hackers whose work we’ve featured make it through safely. We sincerely hope that this madness can be ended and that we can mention the country in the context of cool hacks again rather than war.

If you are interested in the strategic value of inert gasses have a read about the global helium supply.

Products: Compete HR

Raised: $2.5 million in Seed round (Q1 2021)

Founded: May 2020

Founders: Amit Rapaport (CEO) Yoni Wasserman (CTO)

Founded: May 2020

Amit Rapaport is not your typical CEO and her company isn’t just another HR-tech startup either. Rapaport founded the company after working in human resources departments for years - at both SentinelOne and Palo Alto Networks - where she met her husband and co-founder Jonathan (Yoni) Wasserman. Together they manage running a company and taking care of their three boys. But Rapaport doesn’t believe in the work-life-balance motto. “When I’m at work I'm not with my kids but when I'm at home I'm not ‘at work.’ It’s tough but we make it work” she says. “My life is 24/7” she laughs.

She heads Compete an HR-tech platform that provides companies with real-time insights to stay competitive in the job market. “One day while eating dinner the idea struck that I really wanted to do this my husband agreed and then it was all hands on deck” she told CTech in an interview. She founded the company along with her husband who serves as the CTO as both felt that managing human resources at tech companies is much harder said than done.

Companies want to know how much their competitors are paying potential employees and whether they’re overspending or underpaying their staff. These are just some of the questions Compete plans on answering with its data-rich insight-laden platform. “Current solutions aren’t tailored for tech so the level of data and insights that is needed is great” she shared. “I realized that I needed to leave my comfort zone and create my own ‘sense’ of comfort. I led recruitment at big tech companies and knew firsthand how complicated the recruitment process is.”

Staying competitive

Compete provides a Software-as-a-Service platform that provides insights that detail real-time compensation and benefits benchmarks at tech companies. CFOs and other executives can then get an idea of what they should be “paying” employees - whether through salaries equity bonuses commissions and even maternity leave. Compete enables them to anonymously view what their competitors are paying their employees and by analyzing compensation trends can help them recruit better and have higher employee retention and satisfaction. Some of Compete’s customers include Israeli unicorns such as monday.com ironSource AppsFlyer Gong.io Lemonade and others.

Rapaport believes the HR-tech industry is only heading forward. “I think it’s going to conquer the world. At the end of the day it’s all about the people: people either make or break a company. As leaders we need to understand how to be more transparent and use that data.” The insights can all be accessed with a click. In wake of the mass resignation and layoffs during the Covid-19 pandemic those insights have become priceless to companies both trying to recruit and retain talent while remaining competitive.

Initially the company was bootstrapped before closing a $2.5 million Seed round led by Aleph during the first quarter of 2021. Compete is based in Ramat Gan and currently employs 35 people. While some of its employees work remotely in the U.S. it doesn’t have plans to expand overseas just yet. As for going public she believes it will help the company move forward but considered it too early to answer.

Forward-thinking female-led

Perhaps one of the main reasons the platform’s use is so important in 2022 is in trying to close the gender pay gap. “Tech companies want to be competitive but also make sure that they’re paying their employees equally. Now they can be mindful of actually conquering the gender gap by looking at real-time data” Rapaport said.

As a female CEO she makes a point to hire talent regardless of gender. However 50% of the company’s employees are female while four out of six C-level employees (some 60%) are also female. And that forward-thinking female-led management is making big waves. “I think that for women it’s more appealing to see a strong female CEO lead the company. They trust me more know I’ll be on their side and give them equal opportunities” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vaW52ZXN0b3JwbGFjZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi9hcmUtd2Utc3RhcnRpbmctYS1tYWpvci1yYWxseS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are We Starting a Major Rally?,On May 8 a 25-year trading veteran reveals the “market maker” strategy that’s pinpointing gains as high as 197% 317% even 1147% in 30 days or less.,,,,,,,,,

Licht could not be reached for immediate comment and a CNN spokesperson referred an inquiry to Discovery. A Discovery executive declined to comment. Executives at CBS where Licht currently oversees “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” and is an executive vice president involved with programming strategies were not able to offer immediate comment. Puck previously reported the new deal which is said to have been cemented by Discovery CEO David Zaslav who lured Licht away from a growing development deal that Colbert and his senior team have put together with Paramount Global CBS’ parent company.

A formal announcement could come as soon as next week according to one of the people familiar with the situation. Licht is not likely to start in the new role for several weeks as he finishes the terms of his contract at CBS and its parent. A meeting was slated to take placed Saturday afternoon among staffers of CBS “Late Show” according to a person familiar with the program. A “Late Show” spokesperson could not be reached for immediate comment.

Popular on Variety

In hiring Licht Zaslav has lured an executive with qualities similar to Jeff Zucker the former CNN chief whose facility with talent and news production lent CNN new relevance in recent years. Licht has worked closely with everyone from Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski to Norah O’Donnell and Gayle King and has developed a sort of middle-lane format that mixes serious reportage with the lighter fare one needs to succeed in both morning TV and the medium’s late-night wars. Under his aegis as showrunner CBS has usurped NBC as the backer of the nation’s most-watched late-night program with a formula that often has Colbert speaking with top newsmakers as much as he does movie actors and rock stars. Licht will not take over WarnerMedia’s sports operations which had also previously reported to Zucker according to the two people.

The new chief will face heady challenges as well. His predecessor Zucker was ousted earlier this month after failing to disclose a personal relationship with Allison Gollust CNN’s former chief marketing officer. News staffers who developed strong ties that executive over the past decade as CNN became a regular target of the Trump administration have been demoralized by his ouster as well as the firing of former primetime anchor Chris Cuomo. CNN is poised to launch a new streaming-video service CNN Plus but there are questions about whether Discovery which has strong roots in unscripted and documentary-style programming sees the need for such a stand-alone service. “We will in the next in the near-term sit down and get a have a real business plan. discussion with the people that CNN and CNN Plus” Zaslav said in a call with investors earlier this week. “We haven’t had that yet.”

Indeed while Licht has run sizable TV operations he has never commanded a structure as big as CNN a WarnerMedia unit that has in recent years generated over $1 billion in profit and has become as key to the financials of WarnerMedia as Fox News has to its own parent Fox Corporation. CNN isn’t only a series of U.S. news programs. It also has a significant international operation and a large affiliate business that puts its news footage on local stations. CNN also includes HLN the cable network that has struggled to find an identity in recent years.

Under Zucker CNN took on more voice growing beyond its long identity as a vanilla dispenser of down-the-middle news reportage. Anchors have been encouraged to offer analysis and opinion and even get passionate about the top stories of the day. Discovery is expected to make changes potentially placing renewed emphasis on boots-on-the-ground reportage. “There’s no organization news organization in the world that looks like CNN that can do what CNN does. I think it becomes very clear as you go around the world and you look at other news channels that are where people are sitting behind desks and giving their opinion about what’s going on” Zaslav said during the recent investor call talking about CNN’s coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “There’s a news network that’s on the ground with journalists in bulletproof vests and helmets that are doing what journalists do best which is fight to tell the truth in dangerous places so that we all can be safe and we can assess what’s going on and what’s dangerous in the world.”

CNN and its rivals have long thrived as sources of go-to information and increasingly hot-talk opinion about the trending news of the day. But in the world of streaming video their dominance faces new challenges. The networks have seen viewership decline in the wake of the end of the runup to the 2020 election and the aftermath of the January 6 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. CNN’s primetime viewership among people between 25 and 54 — the demographic most favored by advertisers — was off 46% in 2021 according to Nielsen. MSNBC’s was down by 38% and Fox News Channel’s declined by 41%.

Is 1883 the Paramount+ drama’s title or how many tears each viewer shed during Sunday’s finale?

The Yellowstone prequel delivered a rather shockingly emotional and downright bleak ending to its first season finale (well it’s not the finale technically and we’ll get to why in a moment).

Elsa Dutton (Isabel May) — arguably the show’s main character — perished in her father James’ (Tim McGraw) arms after succumbing to her arrow wound. Meanwhile fan-favorite Shea Brennan (Sam Elliott) made good on his promise to see the Pacific Ocean so his late wife could “use [his] eyes to see the world” — then promptly shot himself. The result was an episode that felt firmly like the conclusion of a story not the end of a season and as noted it’s not even that since Paramount+ announced last week the order of “additional episodes” of 1883 while declining to call it a “season two.”

Below 1883 executive producer David Glasser tackled some of the burning questions left by the episode aptly titled “This Is Not Your Heaven” which was written by the Dutton-verse’s prolific showrunner Taylor Sheridan.

I have to admit: I didn’t think Elsa was going to die until about two minutes before she did. I kept thinking she was probably essential to the Dutton family tree and there was no way you guys were going to kill off your narrator and arguably your main character.

Taylor sort of teased you with it in the beginning and what you really understand at the end of the day is that the entire journey comes together at the end. For every single character even down to our young boy John Dutton Jr. you can see where this goes forward in this journey. For James and Margaret [Faith Hill] they lost a daughter but found a place to build a better life. Shea [Sam Elliott] wanted to see the coast one more time — that’s what he wanted out of this journey after losing his family. Thomas [LaMonica Garrett] who had closed everything off in his life found what he wanted: a woman. It’s just one of the things Taylor always promised in the beginning “I’m going to button this up” and just brings everything full circle. You understand the pain of this journey they invested in. Everything that happened sort of has a full-circle wrap to it. He closed every little piece up.

With Elsa though it makes showing her getting shot in the season’s opening flash-forward scene sort of brilliant. We’ve known this was coming for so long that we’ve just assumed she wasn’t going to die even though surviving such a wound would have been highly unrealistic. Then you had James telling us point-blank last week she’s doomed and a savvy viewer thinks “Since we’re being told that something must intervene.” You hid your ending in plain sight.

Exactly and that’s what Taylor does. Everybody thinks it’s gonna be the music and they go off over the hill. I’ve been with him seven years now producing his stuff. It’s never what you think and [the other shows] we have coming up this year there’s never anything that’s on the nose. Taylor believes in dropping you right into a world and you’re going to be immersed in that world and whatever you think is going to happen is not going to happen. I had people telling me on Saturday “Oh we know she’s going to live so why don’t you just tell me?”

And then there’s Shea’s fate. This was also foreshadowed pretty bluntly when he talked about his wife and his promise to take a bit of her soul with him to the shore. Still it was a gut kick being tacked onto the previous scene. Also there’s something about killing off Sam Elliott that as a fan makes me go “How dare you Sir.”

Shea has gone on this journey helping unselfishly all these people and doing something incredible. And I love all our characters but Sam really committed this journey as an individual. Everybody went the distance on this show. We started in July in 105-degree weather in Texas and ended in blistering cold winds of negative 5 10 degrees in the hills of Montana. And the joke went that Taylor wrote a character — Elsa — who’s wearing basically wearing a tank top. But nobody said a word. Tim and Faith they’re husband and wife — they were like their characters and just crushed it. I’ve been very lucky to make a lot of great movies in my life but this was spectacular. This cast and crew just really gave it their all. Everything you see in the show is a bit of what we lived through. There were no covered sets. There were no locations to go to when there was a snowstorm or a rainstorm or a windstorm or a dust storm or extreme heat. We shot through all that and COVID too.

Did any of the fates change for any of the characters along the way — through the writing and production process?

Nope. Taylor is a first-draft writer and what he puts out is what we shoot. When he turns a script in that’s it — there are no pink blue green yellow [revision] pages along the way. There’s none of that. You’re not getting pages on Saturday night on a Taylor show. What you see is what he wrote back in May of last year.

So 1883 was billed as the story of the Dutton clan traveling to Montana and settling there. I’m assuming from this ending that you guys were not originally intending on another season which is why Paramount+ is billing last week’s news as “additional episodes” rather than season two? This seems like it was supposed to be the end of this story.

You’ll see. I don’t want to give away too much but [the announced upcoming Dutton-verse series 1932] was always intended to be the second season. Now the network is excited to bring you something really additional to 1883 which is super exciting. There was one way set with it — there was one version — and now there’s going to be two versions.

Everything is well-thought-out with Taylor. So when you see what’s coming you’ll see it’s pretty exciting. I think 1883 was an incredible journey. We’re excited the way fans embraced it and I’m excited for people to see all the other great stuff that we’re doing around it now.

Can you give a sense of when you’re going to shoot more 1883? And I assume you have the surviving leads back on board?

I can’t give too much away but we’re excited for the year ahead.

We haven’t heard anything about the 6666 spinoff in a while. What’s the latest there? Jimmy and Walker part of the cast?

That’s coming for next year.

And Yellowstone season five is prepping to shoot this fall? Have there been any talks about how many seasons Yellowstone’s story will ultimately have?

We’ll have to wait and see. We just got to see what Taylor has in the tank.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbG9uZ3RpbWUtY2hlbHNlYS1vd25lci1hYnJhbW92aWNoLWhhbmRzLW92ZXItc3Rld2FyZHNoaXAtb2YtZm9vdGJhbGwtY2x1Yi1hbWlkLXJ1c3NpYS11a3JhaW5lLWNvbmZsaWN0LTAxNjQ1OTAzNTE30gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9hbXAvc3RvcnkvbG9uZ3RpbWUtY2hlbHNlYS1vd25lci1hYnJhbW92aWNoLWhhbmRzLW92ZXItc3Rld2FyZHNoaXAtb2YtZm9vdGJhbGwtY2x1Yi1hbWlkLXJ1c3NpYS11a3JhaW5lLWNvbmZsaWN0LTAxNjQ1OTAzNTE3?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Longtime Chelsea owner Abramovich hands over 'stewardship' of football club amid Russia-Ukraine conflict,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/longtime-chelsea-owner-abramovich-hands-over-stewardship-of-football-club-amid-russia-ukraine-conflict-01645903517 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJrZXR3YXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbG9uZ3RpbWUtY2hlbHNlYS1vd25lci1hYnJhbW92aWNoLWhhbmRzLW92ZXItc3Rld2FyZHNoaXAtb2YtZm9vdGJhbGwtY2x1Yi1hbWlkLXJ1c3NpYS11a3JhaW5lLWNvbmZsaWN0LTAxNjQ1OTAzNTE30gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9hbXAvc3RvcnkvbG9uZ3RpbWUtY2hlbHNlYS1vd25lci1hYnJhbW92aWNoLWhhbmRzLW92ZXItc3Rld2FyZHNoaXAtb2YtZm9vdGJhbGwtY2x1Yi1hbWlkLXJ1c3NpYS11a3JhaW5lLWNvbmZsaWN0LTAxNjQ1OTAzNTE3?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseXN0YXJ0cmVrbmV3cy5jb20vcmVhZC9zdGFyLXRyZWstbG93ZXItZGVja3MtZ29lcy1tb2JpbGUtd2l0aC10aGUtYmFkZ2V5LWRpcmVjdGl2ZS1hLW5ldy1nYW1lLWNvbWluZy1zb29uLWZyb20tZWFzdC1zaWRlLWdhbWVz0gGZAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5c3RhcnRyZWtuZXdzLmNvbS9yZWFkL3N0YXItdHJlay1sb3dlci1kZWNrcy1nb2VzLW1vYmlsZS13aXRoLXRoZS1iYWRnZXktZGlyZWN0aXZlLWEtbmV3LWdhbWUtY29taW5nLXNvb24tZnJvbS1lYXN0LXNpZGUtZ2FtZXM_Zm9ybWF0PWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Star Trek: Lower Decks goes mobile with The Badgey Directive a new game coming soon from East Side Games,"The full game description on the Google Play Store reads:

Boot Café Paris

Possibly Paris’s smallest café and certainly the most charming Boot occupies – you guessed it – an old cobbler’s on a sleepy stretch of Le Marais and its cornflower-blue façade original “Cordonnerie” sign and highlighter-bright stools are hard to miss. It takes its coffee very seriously with a single barista serving espressos and Chemex pour-over brews using beans sourced from acclaimed local roastery Belleville Brûlerie. Given that this nook can only fit a handful of seats most customers grab takeaways and mill about outside. It’s my favourite spot for a quick breather.

Bonanza Coffee Roasters Berlin

It used to be that Berliners would be hard-pressed to find a world-class cup of coffee in the capital. Over the past few years however an influx of coffee fanatics has transformed the city into a third-wave roastery haven. Leading the way is Bonanza an “unnecessarily good” roastery sourcing beans from small farms across Africa Indonesia and Latin America. Visitors to the Kreuzberg outpost should note the huge 1950s Probat G45 drum roaster. Some say it’s the source of the best flat whites in Berlin. bonanzacoffee.de Rosanna Dodds

The coffee world’s Savile Row the strip of Sunset Boulevard that runs through Silver Lake seems to have a vendor every 10 paces. If you can bear the dog theme Muddy Paw offers a rear courtyard a front ledge on which to sip come un italiano and a break from the ultra-bitter style of espresso that rules much of bohemian LA. Later-than-average opening hours draw a post-dinner crowd as well as the usual MacBook-wielders and pleasing clutter distinguishes the place from its modishly spartan competitors nearby. muddypawla.com Janan Ganesh

Cuervo Café (Chacarita) Buenos Aires

Childhood friends and musicians Pablo Tokatlian and Agustín Caro always dreamed of owning a coffee shop. So after selling their music equipment in 2017 they finally opened their first café followed more recently by a speciality roaster in an old workshop in Buenos Aires’s Chacarita district. Here they carefully source and roast blends such as Cuervo’s Cumbia line naturally fermented with a good amount of acidity and a light body: ideal for both hot- and cold-filtered preparations. cuervocafe.com Allie Lazar

Ideal Caffe Stagnitta Palermo

There’s a great deal beyond the actual coffee to recommend this historic roastery. The mint location on the Discesa dei Giudici for instance just off the Piazza Bellini (home to three of the prettiest churches in all of Sicily); or the burnished-wood shelves still lined with old-world chocolates and sweets the jars of single-origin beans arrayed in neat rows on the marble counters the 19th-century brewing accoutrements arranged in glass vitrines. But the coffee itself won’t disappoint either: take a seat at one of the tables on the cobblestones and enjoy a ristretto or a macchiato from blends the Stagnitta family has been perfecting since 1928. Then take some home; they even make capsules now. idealcaffe.it Maria Shollenbarger

Don’t miss the chocolate-covered coffee beans and pre-poured bottles of cold brew – the latter won’t go amiss in a makeshift espresso martini. cafeintegral.com RD

Sitting outside at Onibus Coffee

Onibus Coffee (Nakameguro) Tokyo

Japan is a haven for things made with care and precision. Coffee is no exception and even the drinks dispensed in Starbucks are a cut above what you will get in many countries. Of the countless outlets intensely dedicated to their craft I pick Onibus Coffee in a shack by the metro station in Nakameguro. The coffee is superb and you can sit by the serving counter to drink it climb the narrow stairs to a room overlooking the railway tracks or sit on a bench in a neighbouring playground. It all adds to the taste. onibuscoffee.com John Gapper

Forty Hands Singapore

These days Forty Hands has a second location on the residential east coast and a whole plethora of bottled and packaged takeaway potables from cold brews to honey oat lattes but the original opened in 2010 on Yong Siak Street in the low-rise heritage Tiong Bahru neighbourhood remains the standard for artisanal coffee brewers. (None of which is to say you can’t get a bubble coffee if you really crave one; you’re in Singapore after all.) The Dirty Chai – a traditional chai latte with an espresso shot thrown in – was what I lived on for four years in the Lion City. All the beans come from Singapore-based Common Man Coffee Roasters but the artistry – crema dosage froth and all – is signature Forty Hands. There’s a nice Aussie-style brunch menu most days and plenty of beans to go. 40handscoffee.com MS

Tandem Coffee + Bakery Portland

The first thing you’ll notice about Tandem Coffee + Bakery is its unusual home: the café is housed in a former 1960s gas-station-turned-laundromat complete with a sign that reads “Brakes & Shocks – our specialty”. In contrast to its exterior however Tandem is a thoroughly modern third-wave coffee shop and aside from the vinyl it sells alongside its house-roasted coffee its only retro quality is that it’s a WiFi-free zone. Not that the lack of internet deters customers: Tandem regularly draws long queues and popular baked goods sell out early (an unsurprising feat given its James Beard-nominated head baker). tandemcoffee.com CR

Tim Wendelboe Oslo

It’s no coincidence that Tim Wendelboe has been dubbed the René Redzepi of coffee: over the past 20 years the Norwegian roaster and former World Barista champion has brought a haute-cuisine-like meticulousness to his craft championing farm-to-cup supply chains and pioneering the lighter slightly acidic style of Scandinavian roasts. For the full experience head to his flagship espresso bar a slick sliver of raw bricks and chocolate-panelled wood tucked into a quiet pocket of Oslo’s Grünerlokka neighbourhood. Order the “coffee tasting for two” a smorgasbord of four Aeropress-style filter brews highlighting different beans. Or if the weather’s warm try their signature Cappuccino Al Freddo a frothy iced number whipped up in a milkshake maker. A three-Michelin-starred café if ever there was one. timwendelboe.no JW

Sightglass Coffee (SoMa District) San Francisco

It was the viewing window on a vintage Probat coffee roaster that inspired the name of brothers Jerad and Justin Morrison’s California-based coffee company. Just as that window gave them a clear line of sight into their machine’s roasting process the Morrisons have built a business based on trust and transparency – from the seasonal beans directly sourced from origin in freshly harvested lots to its small-batch production methods. Along with a coffee bar Sightglass’s SoMa branch is home to a roastery training lab and headquarters; adventurous guests should try the iced coffee cascara shrub a drink made from the cherry-like fruit surrounding the coffee bean and sparkling water. sightglasscoffee.com RD

Paramount Coffee Project Sydney

The inner-city district of Surry Hills has an embarrassment of great cafés but there’s no better spot for whiling away the day than Paramount. Occupying the foyer of a heritage-listed building formerly home to Paramount Pictures (there’s a working cinema downstairs) this high-ceilinged space has a variety of seating options: morning commuters sip espressos at a communal subway-tiled bar; brunchers munch at low tables; and I’ve lost many a morning sat at one of the light-flooded windows. The coffee made with an ever-changing roster of beans from around the world is excellent and its food menu is also a standout: think twists on Aussie breakfast classics like smashed avo topped with an “everything bagel” crumb and granola spiked with pistachios kiwi and puffed rice. paramountcoffeeproject.com.au JW

FT staff favourite Rosslyn café

Rosslyn (Queen Victoria St) London

James Hennebry and Mat Russell founded Rosslyn in 2018 in a corner of London’s financial district. Inspired by the legendary standards of Australia’s coffee scene the shop aims to spotlight the world’s best producers – all with the warmth of a local Irish pub. As such a trip to Rosslyn is as much about the coffee as it is the friendly service although the thoughtful house blends rotating guest roasters and (not so) secret list of off-menu drinks are enough to satisfy any coffee snob. A new outpost is scheduled for this spring – the third after a second Moorgate location – but Rosslyn’s original branch remains the fan favourite (possibly owing to its proximity to the FT’s London offices). rosslyncoffee.com RD

Ama Cafe Delhi

Nestled in the alleys of Delhi’s Little Tibet – so named for its Buddhist temples Himalayan restaurants and population of Tibetan refugees – Ama Cafe makes for a delightful surprise. While the menu gives a few nods to the neighbourhood’s heritage with a handful of Tibetan dishes it mostly focuses on brunch classics. The chic aesthetic makes it a favourite with Instagrammers who diligently document their cappuccinos and squat sugar-dusted pancakes. Ama is a rare and welcome find in India’s capital. +9192891-08826 Benjamin Parkin

Fans have flocked to Bowen Holden and Pip Heath’s coffee shop for more than a decade lured in by its ethical beans house-made blends and no-nonsense “standing room”. In a city that takes coffee more seriously than most Patricia’s success is based on simplicity.

Beans are divided into three categories – Diversos (regionally diverse coffee varieties) Ancestros (traditional varieties that have been harvested for centuries) and Contemporaneos (beans with unconventional cultivation and fermentation processes) – each aiming to showcase Colombia’s best beans and support local growers. A portion of sales from its coffee bags and cold brew is donated to World Bicycle Relief which provides bikes to citizens of rural developing countries. us.colo.coffee SS

Dizengoff Auckland

Kiwis are above all no-nonsense types. The success of Dizengoff likely results from the same fundamental quality: it’s been around on the Ponsonby Road – the undisputed brunch capital of New Zealand – for decades and has never been divested of its primacy though trends and more fashionable places have come and gone. It’s named for the famous Tel Aviv avenue and the food is Israeli-inflected and delicious – if you’re not getting your long black to go order yourself the pork-free eggs benedict with parsley pesto. What you come for though is the faultless coffee still made in the old-school La Marzocco machine that’s been there for yonks and still bracingly strong. facebook.com/dizengoff.ponsonby MS

Kalei Coffee Co (Hamra) Beirut

For Dalia Jaffal and André Fadel “coffee is more than a caffeinated drink it’s an identity” and the mere smell of roasted beans conjures memories of blissful mornings spent on their grandmothers’ balconies. It’s this nostalgia – alongside the fact that aside from traditional Lebanese coffee the duo had failed to find a perfect cup in Beirut – that led to the launch of Kalei Coffee in 2016 followed by a second branch three years later. The latter serves their fairtrade green coffee in a 19th-century heritage Lebanese house just five minutes’ walk from the Corniche. kaleicoffee.com Gilles Khoury

Occam Deli located right in the park’s neighbouring Schwabing district is a near-perfect spot for a coffee.

Partisan Café Artisanal Paris

Just as Parisians were starting to complain about the quality of their daily coffee brothers Georges and Anthony Karam opened Partisan Café Artisanal in the historical Arts et Métiers district. Having grown up with Lebanon’s renowned coffee culture the brothers wanted to create a space where coffees could be savoured as if they were wines (Anthony has 15 years’ experience in the drinks industry). The resulting café and roasting atelier serves coffee under two major styles: the new wave approach which calls for lightly roasting arabica beans to enhance sweetness fruitiness and vivacity; and the Italian approach a darker roast coffee best suited for espresso. The banana bread is also worth a visit. parispartisancafe.com GK

Ditta Artigianale in Florence

Ditta Artigianale (Via dei Neri) Florence

You wouldn’t have ever said you couldn’t get a good coffee in Florence (heaven forbid; it’s Italy after all). But when Francesco Sanapo opened Ditta Artigianale in the Via dei Neri in 2013 the proposition was a new one – an Italian coffee roaster with an international vision – and the game was subtly changed. What did it mean? Telling the coffee story in a new way one that included free trade single-origin beans and micro-lots community stories and international brewing styles. Translation: while the cappuccino is unassailable so is the flat white. Likewise the cornetto and the avocado toast. Pro tip: the second Via dello Sprone location moonlights as an excellent cocktail venue when evening descends. dittaartigianale.com MS

If you're yet to set up a PayPal account  this may well be the first question you ask. But even if you're one of the company's 392 million active users you could still be wondering if your financial data is being kept secure and whether you're at risk of fraud and identity theft.

PayPal was founded in 1998 and it certainly created a well-tested and highly-trusted online payments system during that time. Lots of major brands use PayPal for their online payments and it's regularly used to transfer money between friends and family. Most people have also come across it when buying items on eBay. But is it really one of the safest ways to conduct a transaction?

How does PayPal secure transactions?

(Image credit: PayPal)

When you enter the details of your bank account credit card or debit card (depending on what you want on file) the data is encrypted and stored in PayPal's secure database. Since this is a single online vault your financial data is only kept in one place rather than across multiple locations. It is regarded as a safer way of retaining your information.

Any transaction you make is also secure. When paying for an item your financial details are never shared. A seller or someone you're transferring money to will never ever see the numbers of your bank or card accounts. That's one of the main points of PayPal — the fact you don't share actual financial information with sellers or people you transfer money to.

What's more all transactions are encrypted at both ends using secure sockets layer (SSL) protocol technology with 128-bit encryption. And as a back-up every transaction is monitored for anything suspicious day and night. If anything is flagged as odd a member of PayPal's team is alerted and this helps to protect against email phishing identify theft and fraud.

Are users protected if something goes wrong?

(Image credit: Future)

It's all very well having a secure financial system but that in itself doesn't protect you if the person you're sending money to turns out to be dodgy. You could legitimately use PayPal to buy an item through an encrypted transaction only to discover the recipient doesn't intend to send the goods or ends up shipping something of poor quality.

In such a situation PayPal should have your back thanks to Buyer Protection. We say “should” because not all transactions qualify (you're not covered if you buy a vehicle real estate industrial machinery or pre-paid cards for instance nor items that violate PayPal's policies). You also need to open a dispute in the PayPal Resolution Center within 180 days of the purchase or payment but it's a nice safeguard nonetheless. If PayPal finds in your favor you will be refunded.

Am I protected if I send money to friends and family?

(Image credit: Future)

PayPal can be used to transfer money to people you know using the PayPal Friends and Family option. The transactions are just as safe as if you're making a purchase online and they don't attract any fees (unless you're sending international personal transactions).

You may however encounter sellers asking you to pay for items and services using the Friends and Family option. Don't! Sellers will be trying to avoid paying PayPal's business transaction fees and while they may tempt you by offering a small discount be aware that you won't have Buyer Protection. Those transactions should instead always be conducted via the PayPal Goods and Services option.

What if I am selling something?

Again the transaction will be safe and secure — you won't see the buyer's financial details and they certainly won't see your's. PayPal will protect you if payment has been sent without authorization from a hacked account for instance or if a buyer claims they did not receive the item you sent. So long as you have proof that you sent an item and that it was received you're eligible for Seller Protection.

Should I use a credit card with PayPal?

(Image credit: Pixabay)

If you can yes. Although credit card protections don't apply if you're using them via online payment systems such as PayPal if anything does go wrong you at least have the option of seeing if your credit card company can help.

By using a credit card you are also distancing PayPal from accounts that potentially contain a large amount of cash. You'll likely find it easier to sort unauthorized payments made through a credit card than you would if someone ended up taking money from your bank account. And money swiped out of a bank account could land you in a heap of trouble if it leads to missed mortgage payments and so on.

How can I make using PayPal even safer?

(Image credit: Future)

You should also use a complex password rather than something easily guessable and safeguard your login further by registering your mobile phone to use a PayPal Security Key — otherwise known as two-factor authorization . When you login to your PayPal account a PIN will be sent to your mobile and this adds an extra layer of security.

Regularly check the email address associated with PayPal too. Emails are sent whenever a transaction is made and if anything looks odd you can report it with a view to be refunded.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tb25leS8yMDIyL2ZlYi8yNy9iZXdhcmUtcGhpc2luZy1mcmF1ZC1uZXctaXJzLXJ1bGVzLW9ubGluZS1wYXltZW50LXNlcnZpY2UtcmVjZWlwdHPSAXBodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vbW9uZXkvMjAyMi9mZWIvMjcvYmV3YXJlLXBoaXNpbmctZnJhdWQtbmV3LWlycy1ydWxlcy1vbmxpbmUtcGF5bWVudC1zZXJ2aWNlLXJlY2VpcHRz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beware: new IRS rules will lead to a wave of phishing frauds,"Thanks to new legislation that went into place at the beginning of this year I predict that a lot of unsuspecting small business owners are about to fall victim to a fresh scam.

The scam will relate to legislation around new tax reporting rules that will affect millions of freelancers and small businesses. As I explained in an earlier column beginning for the 2022 tax year if you receive more than $600 in total payments during the course of the year from a payment service like PayPal Venmo (which is owned by PayPal) Square Stripe or online sales of your products made through Amazon Etsy and other marketplaces – regardless of how many customers are paying – that payment service is required to report that amount to the IRS and to you by sending a Form 1099-K – used for reporting payments via these third parties – in early 2023.

You may think this is a headache but it’s nothing compared with the headache now faced by these payment providers. They now have an enormous new tax reporting requirement. Unfortunately these providers probably don’t have all the information they need about all the businesses they serve in order to properly file these forms and if they don’t get that information the rules say that they’re required to withhold 24% of the payment and remit to the IRS. They don’t want to do that and small businesses don’t want this to happen either. So they will soon be reaching out to their customers for more information. Already they’re laying the tracks.

“You may notice that in the coming months we will ask you for your tax information like a Social Security Number or Tax ID if you haven’t provided it to us already in order to continue using your account to accept payments for the sale of goods and services transactions and to ensure there aren’t any issues when these changes take effect in 2022” PayPal said in a statement. “This helps us meet our obligations to the IRS and ensures that you will be able to continue using your account and access PayPal and Venmo features and services.”

Enter the scammers.

Starting mid-year I predict millions of individuals and small businesses will be receiving requests from payment services they used asking to provide or update their personal information – including their social security and tax identification numbers – so that those services can comply with the new 1099 rules. They’ll come by email mostly although some will be by text.

Unfortunately a scammer can also send a fake text or email – or millions of fake texts and emails – to small businesses that look genuine but surreptitiously divert you to a fake website that not only collects your most personal data but also can download malware into your network to be used for future attacks and mischief. These are called “phishing” scams. You’ve heard of this.

Hopefully your payment vendor has received this information from your business already. And if your business is set up to receive remittances from a payment service provider then it’s likely that the payment service provider has a direct portal on its website for you to update your company’s 1099 information. Stripe for example offers detailed guidance for doing this. So do PayPal Apple Square and Cash App.

But some people aren’t going to do this. And although the IRS provides guidance for avoiding scams during tax season and throughout the year the agency isn’t able to help a small business owner if they fall victim to someone who is pretending to be a payment service like PayPal Venmo Stripe Square and all the other companies that – at least as far as I can tell – aren’t doing a whole lot right now to warn their customers of these potential scams.

So please – be careful. Take a few minutes to visit every one of your payment service providers’ websites and update your 1099 information. Train your financial employees that may be receiving email requests to know what to look for. If you’re not sure of a sender then ignore the email. Report any suspicious requests directly to the payment service provider. If you are submitting information make sure you’re doing it directly on the payment provider’s website and avoid clicking on any links in an email. Otherwise you’ll be opening yourself up to serious problems.

By mid-year I predict you’ll be hearing a lot more about this scam. Start paying attention now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vbG93aW5jb21lcmVsaWVmLmNvbS9ob3ctdG8tc3BvdC1hLXBheXBhbC1zY2FtLWVtYWlsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How To Spot A PayPal Scam Email,"This post may contain affiliate links.

Is there a strange message in your inbox that you think might be a PayPal scam email? Wait just a moment before you click on any links or type something in. Here’s a few ways to tell if your latest email from PayPal is real or fake.

The email doesn’t address you by name

An official email from PayPal should always say your name. If there is only a ‘dear customer’ or something similar that does not specifically address you by name then that should be of concern. Additionally if the email refers to you by your email address or an incorrect name that is also a red flag. A real PayPal email will call you by the name associated with your PayPal account.

Suspicious email address

PayPal will only contact you from an official PayPal email address. Look closely at the email address: did the scammer just change their name to something like ‘PayPal services’? Does the email address end in something like @gmail.com or @hotmail.com? Are there strange letters and numbers in the email address? These are all signs that the email you’ve received is a scam.

The email is trying to make you panic

Scammers will often try to trick you into acting without thinking by creating a sense of urgency or alarm. For example a scam email might tell you that someone has tried to hack into your account or that your PayPal has been temporarily restricted. If there ever is an actual issue PayPal will also let you know via the messages in the app and on the website not just in an email. To check if there is a real problem go to the official PayPal website by typing it in yourself not by clicking the link that the scammer provides you. PayPal will never ask for important documents over email.

What are some general tips for avoiding PayPal email scams?

The Internet safety rules we were taught in the past may not apply anymore as scammers begin to catch on and become more tech savvy. Be sure to keep the following tips in mind when reading PayPal scam emails too!

The ‘s’ in ‘https’ that can be found in the website’s URL doesn’t always mean it’s secure. This used to be a good way to judge a site’s safety. Now hackers have begun building encrypted sites that have this ‘s’ in the URL too.

This used to be a good way to judge a site’s safety. Now hackers have begun building encrypted sites that have this ‘s’ in the URL too. The padlock symbol to the left of the URL isn’t always a 100% guarantee either. Like ‘https’ scammers are beginning to include this icon in their fake websites in order to lull you into a false sense of security.

Like ‘https’ scammers are beginning to include this icon in their fake websites in order to lull you into a false sense of security. Always type in the URL yourself. To be absolutely sure you’re visiting the correct website avoid clicking links or copying and pasting the provided URL into your search bar. Again scammers are becoming more and more tech savvy allowing them to better emulate the correct URL when they send you a link.

Frequently Asked Questions about PayPal Scams

We’ve received a lot of questions about PayPal scams so we’re updating this post to include the most frequently asked questions and their answers.

What should I do if my money or account was stolen through a PayPal scam email?

If a scammer has stolen something from you you can figure out how to report them and get your money back here on PayPal’s website.

Is this email from PayPal real?

In order to tell if the email is real please follow these steps:

Confirm the email address is from @paypal.com. It should not include anything else such as @email.paypal.com or @paypal.xyz.com. It should just end in @paypal.com. If it doesn’t end in just @paypal.com it’s probably a scam. Does the email address you by name or is it generic? If it doesn’t address you by name it’s probably a scam. Does the email create a sense of urgency? Scammers don’t like to give you time to think. If they are demanding that you take action right now it’s probably a scam.

If you’re still concerned that this PayPal email is real the best thing you can do is contact PayPal customer service directly for clarification. Don’t respond to the email itself (or click any links in it) until you’re completely sure it’s legitimate.

The authors of the two case reports cited in the video maintain that the COVID-19 vaccine remains effective and that vaccine-induced meningitis bears a negligible risk. Why we fact-checked this: The video with this claim was posted on February 21 2022 and has amassed more than 480000 views 35000 shares and 22000 reactions as of writing.

Complete details

A video posted by Persida V. Rueda-Acosta the chief public attorney at the Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) features an interview with a woman whose child allegedly got meningitis as a complication of getting the Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine.

In the video the head of PAO’s forensic laboratory cited two case reports in which aseptic meningitis was a complication following the administration of the vaccine. He said “’Pag pinag-aralan mo ’yung causation nito ’yung proximate causation nito talagang alam mo na ito’y nanggaling sa itinurok sa kanila.” (If you study the causation the proximate causation you’ll find that this was caused by what was injected into them.)

These claims are false.

The two studies cited in the video were case reports by Kazuyuki Saito and colleagues of Japan and Joon Kee Lee of South Korea. In the case reports both authors report that the vaccine remains to be effective in protecting individuals from the COVID-19 virus. Joon Kee Lee adds that “[in] general vaccination has decreased the prevalence of viral meningitis with negligible risk of vaccine-induced meningitis.”

In both cases the diagnosis of aseptic meningitis was made as no other possible causative agent for meningitis was found. Given the recentness of the COVID-19 vaccines there are currently no studies that have proven a causal link or association between meningitis and any of the COVID-19 vaccines.

In a review of the merits and limitations of the general study design of case reports the authors remark that case reports cannot establish any epidemiologic quantities. That means case reports cannot speak of how often or rare a health outcome is in a given population nor can they offer a generalizable association between variables.

They add that case reports also cannot establish causality between the variables they are reporting. Thus these two case reports must not be construed as having established any causal or associated relationship between the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and aseptic meningitis. – Renzo Arceta/Rappler.com

The vaccine dubbed Nuvaxovid is protein based — the first of its kind to be approved in Canada.

How does Novavax work compared to Pfizer or Moderna?

Compared to Pfizer and Moderna’s mRNA vaccines that use newer technology Nuvaxovid relies on a more traditional method of eliciting an immune response from the body.

Infection control and infectious disease physician Dr. Alon Vaisman explains that most vaccines are made out of some component of the virus or bacteria itself.

“For example if you were to get a meningococcal vaccine you’re getting a little piece of the cell wall of the bacteria. In this case we’re getting a little piece of the protein that the virus produces” he said.

In comparison the mRNA vaccines contain the genetic code for that protein. The body then makes the protein which in turn triggers the immune system to attack it as an unknown entity.

“[Nuvaxovid] goes one step beyond what the mRNA vaccine would do. Instead of using our own body’s machinery to create that protein this vaccine just gives it to us and shows our immune system the foreign antigen which is what we use to create our antibodies. So it says ‘here’s what it looks like produce the antibodies to this. Next time you see something like this … you should attack it” explains Vaisman.

Is Novavax better than Pfizer of Moderna?

Dr. Vaisman says it is a common misconception that the vaccine that took longer to develop and uses an older method may be more reliable.

“There isn’t a lot of validity to say that Novavax is a ‘traditional one’ so to speak and therefore we can rely on it more” he said.

He adds that many may have felt that the newer mRNA vaccines weren’t tested thoroughly enough or were somehow unsafe but that is not the case. They were first out the gate simply because the genetic sequence of the virus was determined very early on in the pandemic making it possible to develop a vaccine based on that information.

“All vaccines that are approved now in Canada have gone through rigorous testing and are all safe” Vaisman reiterated.

“If anything mRNA vaccines have a lot more experience than any vaccine we’ve ever dealt with. Hundreds of millions of people [have gotten] mRNA vaccines by now — that’s far more data we’ve had in such a short time than probably any vaccine we’ve ever had. The vaccines we’ve had for the last 50-60 years — lots of people have gotten those but it’s over a very long period of time. Here we have so much data piling up very quickly” he added.

Vaisman says the mechanism by which the vaccine works is also not an indicator of efficacy.

“There isn’t any specific reason why you might choose one for another except if you have some kind of personal preference. But in terms of how it works not necessarily” he said. “I think the overall question about which vaccine is right for people is not going to be based on preference. It is going be based on hard data.”

Vaisman cites the flu vaccine as an example saying that there are usually a variety of formulations of it. The one you get isn’t based on your preference but what the data shows about how well it works in various age groups.

“So we give a certain formulation to children to middle aged people and then to seniors because we know that certain formulations work better [for them]” he explained.

Clinical studies show that Nuvaxovid is 90 per cent effective against severe disease and 100 per cent effective against death from COVID-19.

“This vaccine looks really good. How it works in the real world will depend on how it works on the variants and when we see it rolled out in large numbers” he said.

Will Novavax be effective against COVID-19 variants?

Dr. Vaisman says it is too early to know whether Nuvaxovid will be as effective against new virus variants.

“We saw that with mRNA vaccines … as new variants developed its protection against symptomatic disease was reduced but it maintained a very high level protection against severe outcomes like death” he said.

With the current mRNA vaccines if the protein in the virus has not mutated drastically in a new variant additional doses of the same formulation afford additional protection.

It is unclear if new formulations of Nuvaxovid will be required to combat new variants.

“It will probably depend more on what we see in real world data” said Vaisman.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL2thdGhtYW5kdXBvc3QuY29tL2hlYWx0aC8yMDIyLzAyLzI3L2hlYWx0aC1taW5pc3RyeS1zaWducy1ub24tZGlzY2xvc3VyZS1hZ3JlZW1lbnQtdG8tcHVyY2hhc2UtcGZpemVyLWJpb250ZWNoLXZhY2NpbmUtZm9yLWNoaWxkcmVuLWJldHdlZW4tZml2ZS1hbmQtMTEteWVhcnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Government signs non-disclosure deal to buy 8.4 million Pfizer doses for 5-11 year olds,"Government signs non-disclosure deal to buy 8.4 million Pfizer doses for 5-11 year olds

“The safety profile of BNT162b2 is currently only available from short-term clinical studies” the team noted in the Introduction. “Less common adverse effects of BNT162b2 have been reported including pericarditis arrhythmia deep-vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism myocardial infarction intracranial hemorrhage and thrombocytopenia.”

“To better understand mechanisms underlying vaccine-related adverse effects clinical investigations as well as cellular and molecular analyses are needed” they added.

Researchers noted that a May of 2021 study by U.S. researchers had shown that SARS-CoV-2 the virus that causes COVID-19 could reverse transcribe into human DNA and questioned whether the same could happen with Pfizer’s vaccine which uses messenger RNA instructions encapsulated in a manmade lipid nanoparticle to instruct human cells to manufacture the virus’s spike protein for the purpose of eliciting an immune response.

“In this study we aim to examine the effect of BNT162b2 on a human liver cell line in vitro and investigate if BNT162b2 can be reverse transcribed into DNA through endogenous mechanisms” they stated.

The scientists conducted in vitro tests on a human liver cell line tagged Huh7 involving 0.5 1 and 2 milligrams of BNT162b2 over a course of 6 24 and 48 hours.

https://twitter.com/P_McCulloughMD/status/1497284602540351491

In the Discussion section they explained their reasoning for the type of cell used and the dosages “A previous study on mRNA vaccines against H10N8 and H7N9 influenza viruses using a similar LNP [lipid nanoparticle] delivery system showed that the mRNA vaccine can distribute rather nonspecifically to several organs such as liver spleen heart kidney lung and brain and the concentration in the liver is roughly 100 times lower than that of the intra-muscular injection site.”

“In the assessment report on BNT162b2 provided to EMA [European Medicines Agency] by Pfizer the pharmacokinetic distribution studies in rats demonstrated that a relatively large proportion (up to 18%) of the total dose distributes to the liver.”

In the Abstract scientists noted “We detected high levels of BNT162b2 in Huh7 cells and changes in gene expression of long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) which is an endogenous reverse transcriptase.”

During the Results portion of the paper it was noted “A previous study has shown that entry of LINE-1 protein into the nucleus is associated with retrotransposition.”

In turn the team sought to probe whether “BNT162b2 is reversely transcribed into DNA when LINE-1 is elevated.”

To do this they purified the DNA in the Huh7 cell line that was exposed to the 0.5 mg dosage of BNT162b2 across all time frames confirming Pfizer’s injection is reverse transcribed into human DNA as early as the 6 hour interval.

“Our study shows that BNT162b2 can be reverse transcribed to DNA in liver cell line Huh7 and this may give rise to the concern if BNT162b2-derived DNA may be integrated into the host genome and affect the integrity of genomic DNA which may potentially mediate genotoxic side effects” warned the researchers.

They continued “At this stage we do not know if DNA reverse transcribed from BNT162b2 is integrated into the cell genome. Further studies are needed to demonstrate the effect of BNT162b2 on genomic integrity including whole genome sequencing of cells exposed to BNT162b2 as well as tissues from human subjects who received BNT162b2 vaccination.”

Notably a study produced by two Chinese scientists working at Sweden’s Umea University in October of 2021 found that both SARS-CoV-2 and the spike protein produced by vaccination was abundant in cellular nuclei and “inhibits DNA damage repair by hindering DNA repair protein recruitment.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0cmF0aC5hYy51ay9hbHVtbmkvY29ubmVjdGFuZG5ldHdvcmsvd2hlcmVhcmV0aGV5bm93L2pvaG55b3VuZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Young,"Tell us about your background?

I was born in rural Dumfriesshire attended a small village Primary School of around 30 pupils and then Secondary School at Lockerbie Academy. I was always drawn to the sciences and was accepted to study Biology at Glasgow University. My father became ill and died during my second year and I missed a lot of time travelling back to Dumfries to visit him in hospital and consequently had to repeat a year. I was fortunate to meet my future wife Anne while studying at Glasgow.

After Graduation I secured a role on a research course in Professor Bill Stimson’s Immunology Lab at Strathclyde. While the year showed me that being a bench scientist was not my future calling I loved the excitement of the still relatively new and developing subject of Immunology and the foundational knowledge I gained in that year proved very helpful to me in in my latter roles at Pfizer working very closely with Dr Mikael Dolsten Pfizer’s head of R&D and Chairing our Research Portfolio Committee deciding which research programs to progress and which to halt.

I joined Pfizer as a Trainee in 1987 straight from my Immunology Lab. In 1991 a year after starting my first management role I decided to do an MBA and applied to study part-time at Strathclyde Business School completing my MBA in 1994 just after the birth of our first child.

A couple of years later we moved from Glasgow first to the south of England as I had opportunities to develop into more senior commercial roles in the Pfizer UK organization (during which time we had two further children…twin daughters) then for three years to Australia where I ran Pfizer’s business in Australia/New Zealand. Following this we returned to the UK where I was Pfizer UK Managing Director and then Regional President for Europe then in 2012 I was asked to move to the US to join Pfizer’s Executive Leadership team leading first our Primary Care business then Pfizer Essential Health which was a predominantly Emerging Market centred business and latterly Pfizer Innovative Health - our research based business which is still the core of Pfizer today.

My last role at Pfizer has been serving as Chief Business Officer responsible for Strategy business development pricing/access/reimbursement and Chairing our BD and Research Portfolio Committees.

In this role I was privileged to have been able to play a role in the development of our Covid-19 vaccine and Anti-viral medicine along with literally thousands of unsung heroes across the organization.

I will retire from Pfizer after almost 35 years of service later in 2022.

Congratulations on your distinguished career at Pfizer. Can you give us an insight in to the challenges of recent years and sense of achievement following the successful development and delivery of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine?

The biggest challenge for any organization – especially one which is 170 years old – is firstly what businesses do you want to be in and secondly how do you “win” in those businesses. On the first question since 2019 Pfizer has refocused to become a more innovative science driven company informed by our purpose; Breakthroughs That Change Patients' Lives. Strategically this means the separation of great businesses including our Consumer Health business to form a JV with GSK and our Upjohn business which combined with Mylan to form Viatris. This shrank the core of the company but made us much more focused on scientific innovation. In my role as Chief Business Officer I helped develop the strategy for the company as well as oversee its execution. Importantly having made these moves we then focused on strengthening the innovative science in each of our core therapeutic areas by accelerating the most promising internal programs and developing new external partnerships in others. This included Pfizer’s partnership with BioNTech to develop an mRNA vaccine for seasonal Flu from which we applied learnings to develop our COVID-19 vaccine COMIRNITY™ in less than 9 months.

In summary my key learnings are: Be ruthlessly honest about where you have world-leading scientific capability and where you don’t and build around the areas where you do. Secondly be bold in seeking out breakthrough science that aligns with your purpose.

You studied your MBA at Strathclyde – how did this support your subsequent career path?

My MBA gave me great experience in Finance and Accounting which was exceptionally valuable in running a big profit & loss and making portfolio valuation decisions. The Marketing modules were incredibly helpful earlier in my career and the HR modules gave me great food for thought about how to help create a culture where people feel genuinely valued and can learn grow and achieve their potential – something that has always been extremely important to me.

What one piece of advice would you give to current students?

Don’t be afraid to step out of your comfort zone. While all my career to date has been spent with one company on many occasions I have had choices to make with my wife and family about taking new roles I maybe didn’t feel ready for or taking an assignment away from the safety and comfort of home in another country. I have always learned and grown in ways I would never have done if I had stayed “comfortable”.

Any final points or words of wisdom?

We all perform best when we do something we are passionate about – in my case seeking to apply innovative science that can make a real difference to human disease. It is never too early to really ask yourself “what I am I genuinely passionate about” and then set about following your passion!"
PCG,PG&E Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9uYmEvamF6ei9uZXdzL2VuZC1zZWFzb24tZ3JhZGVzLWV2YWx1YXRpbmctamF6ei1rZXlvbnRlLWdlb3JnZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,End of Season Grades: Evaluating Jazz PG Keyonte George,"Despite the Utah Jazz going just 31-51 on the year there were plenty of memorable and enjoyable pieces to the season. One of the brightest was Keyonte George the rookie out of Baylor who burst onto the scene from day one and seized the Jazz starting point guard role.

It’s hard to expect any more from the 20-year-old who was taken with the 16th pick in last summer's draft. George averaged 13.0 points 4.4 assists and 2.8 rebounds per game for the Jazz. Those numbers were good for fourth in scoring and second in total assists amongst all rookies this year. The passing in particular was a lot better than advertised after not being asked to do much of that while at Baylor.

George’s scoring remains the most intriguing piece of his game. He recorded three games in which he scored over 30 points and went over 20 points in nine others. When he’s playing confidently he can get buckets from all three levels and has plenty of juice from long-range. On February 15 George etched his name into the record books when he knocked down nine three-pointers which tied him for the rookie record and put him all alone for Jazz rookies.

An underrated storyline from the season was the leadership role the rookie took on as the season progressed. Jazz head coach Will Hardy thrust him into the starting point guard role early on and along with this came added responsibility- a responsibility that George seemed comfortable with. Heading into his first full offseason George will have even more of an opportunity to be a leader for this Jazz team that is looking to improve.

Despite all the positives it wasn’t a perfect season for George. He like the Jazz's other guards struggled with efficiency. There was a point in the middle of March where George seemed to have figured out how to get to his spots and score more efficiently but those numbers dipped as his teammates missed games and his name became more prominent on opposing scouting reports. Judging by his end-of-season comments he’s not worried about the misses. George said getting stronger and in better shape would result in the shots falling at a higher clip.

Defensively George is still a work in progress. Although his length stands out there's still plenty of room to grow. He has enough size to play either backcourt position which he used to showcase some nice individual defensive sequences. His off-ball awareness needs to improve as does his general focus on that end but he certainly has the potential to be a fine defender in this league.

One area where George can improve is in his words emotional intelligence. He’s immensely talented but he needs to keep his head up when he misses a shot or makes a silly turnover. He’s young though and there’s so much good that it’s hard to dwell on the bad.

Overall it was a very promising season for George. He’ll head into a big offseason with a lot to learn but a great foundation of skills & intelligence to build on. In a postgame press conference Hardy said that Keyonte could become the future of the Jazz program. That is high praise from his head coach but it is certainly a quote that should make you feel good as a Jazz fan.

Point guard Deivon Smith is transferring to St. John's from Utah giving Hall of Fame coach Rick Pitino a veteran replacement for Daniss Jenkins next season.

A fifth-year senior Smith ranked sixth in the country with 7.1 assists per game last season. He averaged 13.3 points and 6.3 rebounds for the Utes compiling five triple-doubles -- second most during a single season in NCAA history and the most by any Pac-12 player.

In a St. John's news release Monday Pitino said the 6-foot Smith reminds him of Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier a standout player for Pitino at Louisville.

""Super excited to have Deivon Smith joining the Johnnies"" Pitino said. ""Total dog who rebounds creates and scores.""

Smith from Decatur Georgia played his freshman season at Mississippi State and then spent two years with Georgia Tech. He shot a career-high 46.7% from the field in 28 games during his only season at Utah.

Two of his triple-doubles came during Utah's run to the NIT semifinals and he scored a career-best 28 points against tournament runner-up Indiana State on April 2.

Smith becomes the third notable transfer the Red Storm have landed this offseason joining 7-foot-1 center Vincent Iwuchukwu from USC and 6-foot-7 forward Aaron Scott from North Texas. They both committed last month.

At point guard St. John's also returns sophomore Simeon Wilcher a touted recruit who began to show marked improvement late last season in his limited role as a freshman. Wilcher averaged 2.8 points and 9.1 minutes in 28 games as Jenkins' understudy.

Jenkins followed Pitino from Iona to St. John's for his senior season and propelled the Red Storm to a 20-13 record including 11-9 in conference play for their most Big East wins in 14 years. They reached the Big East tournament semifinals for the first time since 2000 losing 95-90 to eventual NCAA champion UConn.

Jenkins led the team in scoring (14.9 points per game) assists (5.4) steals (1.6) and minutes (30.7) earning second-team All-Big East honors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYXJpem9uYXNwb3J0cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvMzU0NzMwMi9mb3JtZXItYXJpem9uYS1wZy10LWotbWNjb25uZWxsLWNvbnRpbnVlcy1zdXJwcmlzaW5nLWluLW5iYS1mb3ItcGFjZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former Arizona PG T.J. McConnell continues surprising for Pacers,"Former Arizona Wildcats point guard T.J. McConnell is approaching a decade in the NBA an unlikely journey that has even seen McConnell become a playoff X-Factor for his Indiana Pacers. He was a huge part of Indiana nearly pulling off the upset in the first round versus the New York Knicks in a 121-117 Game 1 loss.

McConnell had 18 points three assists and three steals on 9-of-16 shooting in 22 minutes.

McConnell went undrafted in 2015 not thought of as much of a NBA prospect. He was not a shooter at the time and hasn’t developed into one since. He’s generously listed at 6-foot-1 lacks explosive movement and didn’t score too much as a Wildcat either.

What McConnell can do however is read the floor at an expert level and use his quickness from there to shift it mostly to set up his teammates. This got him a shot at making the Philadelphia 76ers roster which he did and he has been a near-constant as a rotation player since.

This season McConnell’s ninth in the league has really seen him break out as a bucket-getter. Yes you read that correctly. From Feb. 6 on McConnell off the bench averaged 13.3 points per game while shooting 58.2% from the field. Again that’s while taking less than one 3-pointer a game and for the season he knocked down 56.8% of his 2s.

McConnell’s quite honestly weird midrange game at Arizona consisting of 12-foot fallaways and other odd touch shots at the rim is now something he’s able to activate more frequently with confidence and a high level of understanding for where the real estate will be. On a spaced-out roster built around floor general Tyrese Haliburton McConnell has the room to scoot around and take his goofy shots.

He’s even got a little bit of shake to his handle despite dribbling like someone from a half-century ago.

T.J. McConnell slices through the defense and gets to the hoop for two 💨 pic.twitter.com/DzNx7AAHj5 — Indiana Pacers (@Pacers) May 7 2024

Defenses just aren’t used to defending someone like him. Looking at guards around his size McConnell was the first to put up at least 10 points a game with under one 3PA/G since Derrick Rose in 2016-17 and Tony Parker in 2015-16 per Stathead. New York was understandably trying to get away with either Jalen Brunson or Miles McBride defending McConnell without using its best perimeter options on him before changing that late.

One of McConnell’s signature attributes is his pace of play which will help the Pacers tremendously against the Knicks. McConnell always wants to get the ball up quickly and is rarely going to waste dribbles looking to at least threaten for the paint whenever possible like one of his all-time favorites Steve Nash. Defensively he will pick guys up fullcourt to do some pest work and moves like a guy who never runs out of energy.

The Knicks play a short rotation and commonly put starters in the low-to-mid 40s for minutes and Indiana was deliberately speeding the game up on both ends to play the long game of wearing New York down. McConnell will be a key part of that effort with his importance in a second-round series still being hard to believe.

Blocker played in 27 games starting five for Arkansas as a true freshman. He averaged just under four points per game.

As a member of the Class of 2023 Blocker was a four-star recruit out of Little Rock (Ark.) Sunrise Christian (Kans.) according to the On3 Industry Ranking a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. He was the No. 2 overall prospect coming out of Kansas the No. 12 point guard in the class and the No. 45 overall prospect in the class.

Blocker shared on social media when he intended enter the transfer portal.

“Prayer hard work and sacrifice opened up the doors for me to have an opportunity to play college basketball” Blocker said. “First and foremost I want to thank God for blessing me with the talent to play this game. I want to thank the University of Arkansas basketball coaching staff for recruiting me. It was an honor to represent the state of Arkansas and the Razorback program. I’m grateful for my teammates that have become brothers that who’ve all supported me on this journey.

“Thank you to all of the fans and the community for your love and support throughout the season. I also want to give a special thanks to the local businesses for your support. After much discussion and consideration I’ve decided to enter the transfer portal.”

To keep up with the latest players on the move check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.

Blocker’s former coach Eric Musselman who left to take the USC gig raved about his former player’s development back in February.

“I thought he played really good tonight” Musselman said. “Obviously his two steals in the 23 minutes that he was in he was able to guard (Wade) Taylor and did a really good job other than the fouls. But we want him to be aggressive defensively. I thought he was phenomenal tonight.”"

The PCMC administration had eased Covid-19 restrictions on February 2 and allowed access to its swimming pool to all citizens. On Sunday many children were denied at the Pimple Gurav pool the only one faility which remained open in the industrial city. The suburbs of Pimple Gurav Sangvi and Kasarwadi each have a swimming pool run by the civic body and are located within 2 km of each other.

While the pools at Kasarwadi and Sangvi had notice boards hanging at the gates announcing the closure of the facility due to repair works the Pimple Gurav pool had its gates shut when a batch of swimming enthusiasts turned up for the 8 am slot.

The staff at the swimming pool had allegedly locked the premises from inside.

Sunil a class 9 student said “I had come from Kasarwadi as the swimming pool there was shut for repairs. Here I arrived for the 8 am batch just five minutes late. They did not allow me inside. The premises remained shut from inside. 15-20 other children were waiting outside. Despite our requests we were not allowed inside. I don’t know whether the swimming pools are for children or PCMC employees.”

The pool at Kasarwadi even put up a board declaring that it would be shut for two months due to repair works. (Express Photo) The pool at Kasarwadi even put up a board declaring that it would be shut for two months due to repair works. (Express Photo)

Another swimmer K Dhanavate a local resident said “As soon I arrived I saw the gates closed. Several children were waiting outside with nobody to take them inside. I don’t understand how PCMC can run a swimming pool like this. Is it meant only as a showpiece or a facility to encourage children to take to sport?”

Sushma Shinde in-charge of PCMC’s swimming pools said “I will inquire as to why children were blocked entry from the Pimple Gurav swimming pool.”

Jayshree Salve supervisor for sports with PCMC said “Some children were left out at the Pimple Gurav pool as we have orders that it should be run only with 50 per cent capacity. As for the timings we allow only 30 minutes for the swimmers. This is again according to the orders of the civic administration.”

Salve said of the 13 swimming pools 12 are shut. “This is because for two years the pools were closed. Now they are undergoing some repair works. We started the Pimple Gurav pool with great difficulty. For starting a pool we need to fill up the tanks with water. It needs at least three weeks. Besides water availability is also a problem as the city receives water every alternate day” she said.

PCMC Additional Municipal Commissioner Vikas Dhakane said “I will convene a meeting of the concerned officials to find out the state of the swimming pools. Also regarding the batch timings I will talk to the officials so that children can be given sufficient time.”

Debunking PCMC’s claim of becoming a sports hub corporator Asha Shendge said “If 12 pools are shut how can Pimpri-Chinchwad become a sports hub? Imagine for two years the swimming pools were out of bounds for sportspersons and other kids. And now they are shut for repairs. I don’t understand what the civic sports department was doing for the last two years. The civic administration should have carried out the repair works when the pools were shut.”

In the budget presented by Additional Municipal Commissioner Vikas Dhakane last week the civic administration declared its intention to revamp the existing sports facilities and set up new sports infrastructure in a bid to make Pimpri-Chinchwad a sports hub.

Shendge said the timings of the swimming pools are big a problem. “PCMC is not taking the sport of swimming seriously. The batches are barely for 20 -30 minutes. In the morning by 8.30 am the pools get shut for boys. 15 minutes are reserved for shower. If the timings are so short when will the children swim? When will they learn and become international stars? PCMC’s approach is not serious to swimming” she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzNWNsZXZlbGFuZC5jb20vbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy9vaGlvLXBvbGl0aWNzL3Byb2N0ZXItYW5kLWdhbWJsZS1oZWlyZXNzLXByb3Bvc2VzLWJpbGwtdG8tc3RvcC10aGUtdHlwZS1vZi1hbmltYWwtdGVzdGluZy1wLWctaGFzLWRvbmXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Procter and Gamble heiress proposes bill to stop type of animal testing,"COLUMBUS Ohio — The heiress of Procter and Gamble a multi-billion dollar consumer goods company is proposing legislation in the Ohio House to stop cosmetics testing on animals. P&G although saying they are mainly cruelty-free now continues experimenting on animals.

Plenty of makeup is tested on animals like rodents — and dogs and cats — something state Rep. Sara Carruthers (R-Hamilton) wants to change.

""Some of this stuff is just inhumane sick and unnecessary"" Carruthers said. ""A lethal dose test involves forcing rats to swallow large amounts of chemicals until the subject dies so that you can determine the dose that causes death.""

She and state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney (D-Cleveland) introduced House Bill 495 which would stop the majority of animal testing for cosmetics sold in Ohio.

Not only would this save animals but it would also help the economy — since consumers want cruelty-free products Carruthers said.

The vegan cosmetic market is growing exponentially in part because of Generation Z's interest in ""ethically sourced products"" according to UNiDAYS a popular student shopping app that conducts market research.

But Carruthers' background is what made her interested in animal rights.

""My great great grandfather did it — they did use animal testing"" she said.

Carruthers is a descendant of Cincinnati-based company Procter and Gamble and she wants companies like hers to stop animal experimentation. Although her family still has some influence they no longer have a vote in the company policies and have no position on the board. She says her family no longer owns any part of the corporate giant but their Procter-side of the family continues to be a fixture in the Cincinnati area.

I reached out to P&G whose spokesperson said in a statement that their PETA cruelty-free brands are not tested on animals. However that is a small percentage. They have 79 brands and only 13 are on the PETA-certified list.

""P&G has invested over $480 million in non-animal test method development over decades and is partnering with groups like PETA and the Humane Society International & US working closely with governments to end animal testing globally"" the company said.

Some countries still mandate testing on animals they added.

A significant portion of their products are made in China according to 2018 testimony given to the U.S. Trade Representative and Chinese regulations require testing on products like toothpaste hair treatments and anything with sunscreen in it like a moisturizer or foundation.

I asked for a multitude of clarifications on their ""cruelty-free"" policy including data backing up their statements of being anti-animal testing. They were not addressed in their short statement.

It isn't just the United States and China that they have plants. They have factories on all continents minus Antarctica. Some locations have rules against animal testing some require it and others have other types of restraints — such as Japan which holds each ""institution responsible for self-regulation"" according to researchers.

""Let's go for made in America right?"" Carruthers said. ""We have modern testing methods like human cell-based tests sophisticated computer models.""

But bioethics expert and law professor at Case Western Reserve University Sharona Hoffman says the change could be a huge blow to medical advancements.

""Computer modeling is not a substitute for all animal studies — and also you have to worry about the expense"" Hoffman said.

Carruthers responded that data has shown that animal alternatives are actually cheaper but Hoffman is doubtful.

""Growing tissue in labs is quite expensive"" the professor said.

The bill language is broad and it could seemingly impact research to help burn victims or patients who want reconstruction surgeries after cancer or trauma.

""If you're talking about lipstick or blush I would probably agree that you don't need to use animals"" Hoffman said acknowledging that makeup isn't the true concern of hers. ""But for other treatments we have to remember 'cosmetic' is very very broad.""

The National Association for Biomedical Research is also concerned stating that the bill may have a negative impact on ""new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual — cosmetic and medical — application.""

NABR's full statement from spokesperson Eva Maciejewski:

""Measuring the safety and efficacy of a new molecule or compound usually involves preclinical testing with animals and adjunct methods and then phased human clinical trials. Scientists and regulators strive to reduce the number of animals used. They also prioritize the development and adoption of refinement methods. However scientists cannot observe the combined effects of a new molecule or compound on the body’s interconnected systems over time by relying exclusively on artificial intelligence organ chips and other non-animal methods. They also need to use animals to determine if the new molecule or compound is safe enough to begin human clinical trials. It is therefore unclear whether the proposed state bill HB 495 could have a negative impact on new compounds and molecules that are being developed for dual - cosmetic and medical - application.""

""Animal studies do not proceed without any oversight"" Hoffman added. ""This isn't just some scientist collecting rats in the garage and then experimenting on them.""

Carruthers argued there are exceptions such as when there is no non-animal method available.

""This is a no-brainer"" the lawmaker said.

This bill will likely be heard in the coming months. She also introduced another bipartisan bill to crack down and try to prevent puppy mills which she said she talked to P&G about.

The visit was emblematic of Mr. Gonzalez’s approach to criminal justice: Alongside dozens of parishioners he and several local officials and police leaders listened to music prayer and a biblical account of healing by faith and touch.

When the service was over Mr. Gonzalez and a top police commander stepped outside and into a crime scene. Just down the street at around 2 a.m. that day an 18-year-old man had been fatally shot in his car — Brooklyn’s 11th homicide of the year.

A few short hours and a few hundred feet apart the two episodes illustrated the narrow path that Mr. Gonzalez must walk. First elected in 2017 he pledged to bring a modern progressive approach — a prosecutor’s healing touch — to a criminal justice system that has long been seen as a source of inequity. But as he begins his second term stubborn increases in shootings gang violence and other crimes have focused the city’s attention on public safety and complicated Mr. Gonzalez’s ability to fulfill that pledge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vcmV2ZWFsbmV3cy5vcmcvcG9kY2FzdC90aGUtYml0dGVyLXdvcmstYmVoaW5kLXN1Z2FyLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Bitter Work Behind Sugar - Reveal,"Al Letson: Hey it’s Al and last fall we brought you Mississippi Goddamn.

Al Letson: From The Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX this is Reveal. I’m Al Letson. This past July in Baltimore amid fireworks and patriotic music workers relit the famous Domino Sugar sign which was under repair. For decades this icon has cast a red glow over the city’s inner harbor. You can see it from miles away. Each year Domino produces millions of pounds of refined sugar for candy makers and supermarkets. But if you look at their packaging it doesn’t say exactly where that processed sugar originates. Some of it comes from cane grown in the US. Brazil and Mexico are also big suppliers.



Al Letson: Then there’s the Dominican Republic where still today on vast plantations sugar cane is cut by men with machetes and hauled away by ox drawn carts. The work is grueling the conditions harsh. Recently hundreds of workers protested in the Dominican capital Santo Domingo. They chanted “Without cane cutters there is no sugar.” These men are from Haiti and are among the thousands of Haitians living across the islands border in the Dominican Republic. They’re demanding simple things like the pensions they were promised and better living conditions for their families.



Al Letson: Last fall we brought you a story about the hardships these workers face in harvesting raw sugar that’s exported to the US. Since then there’ve been some big developments. So we’re revisiting the investigation from reporter Sandy Tolan. When Sandy first visited the Dominican Republic 30 years ago things were even worse for the cane cutters and their families.



Sandy Tolan: Walking down this dirt street and each house is surrounded by standing black water which is just human waste and garbage. Kids playing around this water. It’s a breeding ground from mosquitoes. It’s a really poor place.



Al Letson: In the sugar plantations Sandy met people living in work camps who’d been trafficked into the Dominican Republic and forced to cut cane.



Speaker 4: (singing)



Al Letson: He recorded this cane cutter singing in Haitian Creole asking a spirit to lead him to a better life.



Al Letson: In the Dominican Republic the biggest sugar company and largest exporter to the US is the Central Romana Corporation. Back in the 1980s it was bought by a group of investors led by two Americans Alfonso and Pepe Fanjul. The company supplies millions of pounds of raw sugar for the Fanjul’s empire. In addition to Domino Sugar the Fanjuls also have major interests in C&H and Florida Crystals.



Al Letson: Over the years the Fanjuls and the Dominican sugar industry have come under pressure to improve the situation for Haitian cane cutters from local activists human rights groups the United Nations and the US department of labor and they claim they’ve done just that. So Sandy decided to go back to the Dominican Republic to see for himself. His story was made possible with support from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.



Sandy Tolan: Locomotives roll past undulating waves of sugar cane their green weedy tops blowing in the wind. We’re at the Eastern edge of the Dominican Republic where the train cars are piled high with cane stocks. We’re rolling into an empire a plantation of sugar nearly the size of New York city all the property of the Central Romana Corporation. Scattered across this territory work camps owned by the company. They’re called bateyes.



Euclides Corder…: My name is Euclides and we are in the Carretera.



Sandy Tolan: I’m driving with my reporting partner Euclides Cordero Nuel. He’s a Haitian Dominican journalist who knows a lot about life here. Euclides grew up on a bateye alongside thousands of other workers in their families part of a long history of migration of patients to the Dominican Republic.



Euclides Corder…: Growing up at the bateye is not easy because your parents are working in the sugar camp plantation but the payment is very low. You just have food for very little.



Sandy Tolan: Euclides was just two years old the first time I came to report on life in the bateyes. Since then Central Romana says it’s poured millions of dollars into the bateyes to improve living and working conditions. We’re going to check that out.



Euclides Corder…: We’re heading towards a bateye named Las Kakata.



Sandy Tolan: Kakata is a place Central Romana calls a model bateye. We walk the quiet streets laid out in a grid about a mile long in total. At first we see small houses in tidy rows with dirt yards families relaxing the kinds of uplifting images promoted Central Romana’s website a boy in his front yard singing to Jesus. But as we walk deeper into the bateye we reach a grim looking line of concrete barracks.



Euclides Corder…: Here we go.



Sandy Tolan: And just beyond we find two cane cutters sitting on a pair of broken plastic chairs. Euclides greets them warmly in they’re native Creole and they invite us to join them.



Sandy Tolan: I’m calling the men Julio and Cardenas. They don’t want us to use their real names out of fear of retaliation for talking with outsiders. And that’s the case with most of the workers we meet in the bateyes. Cardenas says on a good day he can cut about a metric ton of cane. That’s 2200 pounds. And that one ton gets them a little over $3 from Central Romana. The company says it pays more than the national minimum wage and younger men can cut more and make five six even eight bucks a day but not Julio and Cardenas.



Euclides Corder…: If it’s good you can cut one ton per day.



Sandy Tolan: A lot of the sugar Julio Cardenas and their fellow workers cut ends up in the US. The men say they’ve been doing this kind of work for the past 40 years. They’re way past retirement age. Cardenas is almost 80. But even though Central Romana deducts government pension funds from their paychecks they say they’ve never seen one peso of it.



Euclides Corder…: It’s not my first time working because I make requests for my pension and I don’t have it. They [crosstalk].



Sandy Tolan: And like so many of the caneros or cane workers we meet they say they could never afford to get regular working papers. And that neither the government nor Central Romana is helping them get legal status or their pensions. And so they’ve been undocumented for decades.



Euclides Corder…: They have to stay in the bateye for their whole life until they die because they cannot have any other job.



Sandy Tolan: So every day they slash and slash under an unrelenting sun sharp stalks cutting into their hands.



Sandy Tolan: Feel like they treat you well the bosses?



Euclides Corder…: For me I’m not good.



Sandy Tolan: Euclides repeats “But do they treat you well here?” Cardenas stabs his machete into the ground. He’s choking back tears.



Euclides Corder…: And you can see how they treat us here as a Haitian. Now if you have to go to the hospital you have to find you own money to spend on your sickness.



Sandy Tolan: So if you get sick what happens?



Euclides Corder…: If you don’t have money you’re going to die.



Sandy Tolan: There’s so much more we want to ask them like what were your dreams when you first came from Haiti decades ago? But we never get that chance because just as we’re about to ask another question two armed men in uniform pull up on a motorcycle. They want to know what authorization do we have to talk to the workers.



Euclides Corder…: You guys you have to understand us. We are protecting interests here.



Sandy Tolan: Okay let’s go.



Sandy Tolan: Protecting interests here is paramount. By one estimate Central Romana generates nearly a billion and a half dollars in revenue every year a lot of it from raw sugar exported to the US.



Sandy Tolan: In this vast landscape of cane and company work camps we’re learning something. Central Romana is a kind of state within a state with a large private security force that doesn’t like outsiders poking around. Still in six separate reporting trips spread out over two years Euclides and I managed to visit about two dozen bateyes where the workers and their families welcomed us.



Euclides Corder…: [foreign language].



Sandy Tolan: This is what we see. Flimsy wooden houses cracked crumbling walls a mattress on the bare floor a few clothes drooping from a piece of rope darkness in an estimated 90% of bateyes no electricity and so many holes in the roof it rains on you when you’re sleeping. Seeing all this it really hits you when realize that fabulous modern luxury is 10 minutes away. We drive past the international airport toward the turquoise Caribbean to another property of Central Romana one the tourists know by a different name.



Euclides Corder…: Hello?



Speaker 6: Hello.



Euclides Corder…: How are you?



Sandy Tolan: Casa de Campo.



Euclides Corder…: Thank you. And which way do I go?



Speaker 7: Good morning from Casa de Campo here in the Dominican Republic. Here’s our view this morning.



Sandy Tolan: When the Fanjuls bought the sugar operation nearly 40 years ago Casa de Campo came with it. The luxury resort bills itself as the best in the Caribbean. Alfonso and Pepe Fanjul when they’re not at their West Palm Beach mansions enjoy a huge house here called Casa Grande. And the resort is a popular destination for A-list celebrities European royalty US presidents. On Casa de Campo’s 7000 acres you can play polo hit the spa rent a villa pilot a yacht shoot life pigeons or skeet.



Sandy Tolan: At the shooting range a young American fires her rifle into the clear blue sky. Her name is Elise Mordos. She’s from New York and won a free trip for two to Casa de Campo. “The resort” she says “Is very nice” but she knows poverty lies just outside the well secured gates.



Elise Mordos: I think it’s pretty bifurcated because you come to the resorts and it’s safe and the minute you step outside is when you really see how people live. When you are trying to appeal to wealthy individuals you have to kind of isolate them somewhat.



Sandy Tolan: At dusk Euclides and I are sitting on a patio at the resort at the edge of the golf course. He can’t stop up thinking about where he grew up a bateye just like the ones a few miles from here.



Euclides Corder…: Really really really not too comfortable. I’m in the university. If I would not have the chance to have education I could be there cutting cane. I could. Why not?



Sandy Tolan: It turns out Euclides didn’t just live in the bateye with his family. When he was 14 he picked up a machete. He was starting high school and needed money for some basics.



Euclides Corder…: I went to work in the sugar cane because I needed shoes to go to school in that time. My mom doesn’t have the money. I use the shoes of my brother.



Sandy Tolan: You guys shared the shoes?



Euclides Corder…: We share it.



Sandy Tolan: That evening in another part of Casa de Campo we visit a replica of a 16th century Mediterranean village thousands of lights festoon in the full Renaissance church.



Sandy Tolan: If you counted every light you’d get into the tens of thousands.



Euclides Corder…: I know. But you go to the bateyes there’s no light no electricity. And the people doesn’t have food to eat doesn’t have money broken housing. And look here it’s the contrast. It’s the contrast.



Sandy Tolan: The contrast here is stark and powerful but it’s something Central Romana executives won’t talk to us about. For months the company’s top PR guy repeatedly denied my requests for interviews though they did provide written responses to some of my questions. But we still wanted a tour so one day you Euclides and I drive to company headquarters to try to talk to someone. No-one came out to meet with us here either. “It’s a private company” we’re told but we’re invited to stay and read a glossy coffee table book about Central Romana.



Sandy Tolan: We read about the company’s 25000 employees. It’s cattle real estate and tourist businesses and how Central Romana treats its workers with “respect” and provides healthcare for all cane cutters and their families.



Sandy Tolan: When it comes to healthcare in the bateyes we get a very different picture. A study by the Dominican Ministry of Health shows child malnutrition rates are sharply higher than the national average. We spoke with dozens of Central Romana workers and with doctors who said many cane cutters and their families have limited access to company health care and almost never see the inside of Central Romana’s state-of-the-art hospital. Guests of Casa de Campo on the other hand get priority attention at the hospital according to the resort’s website. As for the medical vans Central Romana sends into the bateyes workers say they’re hard to access and aren’t nearly enough to treat their many ailments.



Sandy Tolan: In Bateye 80 Euclides and I arrive as an after work baseball game is in full swing in the dirt streets. The workers we meet here say they’ve gotten repeatedly sick from spraying herbicides severe headaches back aches dizziness nausea double vision. More than 30 workers in multiple Central Romana bateyes described a range of these symptoms.



Sandy Tolan: More than half of those cited insufficient protective equipment like ripped aprons loose fitting boots and faulty masks. This man says he sometimes sprays herbicides for a week without a working mask.



Euclides Corder…: And they don’t care about it. And they say “Tomorrow tomorrow we back and bring you new one” and they don’t appear with the new one.



Sandy Tolan: He’s not the only one complaining of lax safety protocols. One fumigator we interviewed showed us how he mixes big vats of chemicals in an open barrel with a stick.



Sandy Tolan: And then we meet another worker who says he fell gravely ill after spraying herbicides. This man’s name is Raul [Jean Erville]. Raul is 49. He migrated from the eroded lands of Haiti’s northern coast about 20 years ago and has worked the cane ever since. For the last two years he says he’s sprayed chemicals for Central Romana. During that time he was diagnosed with HIV. Raul says because of the chemical spraying he also had trouble breathing. After a year of fumigating work Raul tells us he started getting the flu. Fever. Then came the rashes burning skin. His respiratory problems grew worse. In November 2018 Raul tells us he collapsed on the job. His fellow fumigators took him to the hospital the public hospital not Central Romana’s where he was diagnosed not only as HIV positive but with tuberculosis. Raul believes the exposure to herbicides nearly killed him and that his bosses didn’t care.



Euclides Corder…: If you die it’s your problem. They don’t say anything.



Sandy Tolan: Are they compensating you at all for your disability?



Euclides Corder…: Never. They don’t give me anything.



Sandy Tolan: Raul tells us he needs a ride to the medical clinic. We tell him “Sure. We can go on Tuesday.” We return. But before we can get to Raul we’re spotted by another security guard.



Euclides Corder…: He’s a Central Romana police. He have a gun. He showed the gun.



Sandy Tolan: The guard starts following us. He doesn’t want us talking to people. Then he orders us to leave. I walk toward our truck. Euclides goes to find Raul. We meet up at the edge of the bateye. Raul dives into the backseat face down. He’s terrified that Central Romana security will spot him with outsiders.



Sandy Tolan: Okay. So we’ve got Raul. We’re taking Raul to the doctor. So now Raul is lying down in the backseat so he’s not going to be noticed.



Sandy Tolan: We try to get Raul to his doctor but we can’t find her. And by this point Raul’s exhausted. He says he just wants to go back to the bateye. Euclides and I say goodbye. We make plans to meet up on our next visit. Raul walks off. His shoulders slump as he raises a bony arm to flag a scooter.



Sandy Tolan: We soon discovered that the health problems reported by the fumigators seem to go way beyond Raul and the other men we’ve interviewed.



Sandy Tolan: Euclides and I are in the town of [inaudible]. Several dozen men are giving statements to an American attorney and his legal team for a series of lawsuits back in the US.



Robert Vance: I’m Robert Vance. I’m on the one of the plaintiff’s lawyers in the case.



Sandy Tolan: One lawsuit on behalf of the Haitian fumigators cites chronic health problems due to pesticide and herbicide exposure. So far nearly 400 fumigators have given statements to Vance’s team for a lawsuit involving a company that sells the chemicals to Central Romana.



Robert Vance: We ask them a series of questions. Have you had any the following symptoms eye irritation skin irritation vomiting diarrhea nausea stomach headache?



Sandy Tolan: The health problems echo what we’ve been hearing from Raul and the other fumigators.



Sandy Tolan: Robert Vance’s lawsuit targets the chemical manufacturer Drexel. But in another suit he takes on Central Romana and the Fanjul family corporation.



Robert Vance: Fanjul Corporation is directly responsible for the conditions of the bateyes where the caneros and fumigators live to the use of the pesticides. They have never really been required to do what is ethically and morally right by their employees because no-one has forced them to.



Sandy Tolan: The Fanjul Corporation did not comment on the suits. A Central Romana spokesman wrote “We are very surprised to hear the workers’ claims” and that “All workers have the required protective equipment.”



Sandy Tolan: It won’t be easy to hold either company legally responsible in the US for chemical contamination problems in the Dominican Republic. There’s the question of jurisdiction and Central Romana won’t divulge its corporate structure or the size of the Fanjul family’s stake or exactly who’s calling the shots. What’s more according to documents filed in US Federal Court Central Romana is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands a tax haven that helps keep company assets and ownership secret.



Sandy Tolan: Robert Vance’s lawsuits are facing potential setbacks. And even if they’re successful it’ll be too late for some fumigators.



Euclides Corder…: Was this-



Sandy Tolan: This past June Euclides and I returned to Bateye 80 to see Raul but he wasn’t there. Raul Jean Erville had died alone of respiratory failure in his rickety shack. With some friends and neighbors we went to the place where Raul was buried.



Euclides Corder…: We just came here to pay respect.



Sandy Tolan: We walked through a small graveyard just outside the bateye and stopped at a mound of dirt. Here lay Raul’s body.



Sandy Tolan: There’s just a stick in the ground painted white. Doesn’t have a name. Nothing written there.



Euclides Corder…: It’s a shame. A man like Raul who worked many years in sugar cane just buried in the dirt. There is no cross. Make me very sad because this man worked hard and he doesn’t deserve this. He doesn’t deserve this.



Al Letson: For generations workers like Raul Jean Erville have toiled in the Dominican cane fields. Coming up we meet a man who decided to speak out.



Father Christop…: These people live born and die in this same paradise but they live in it as slaves.



Al Letson: That’s next on Reveal.



Al Letson: There’s a new podcast out I think Reveal listeners would like. It’s called The Heist and it comes from our friends at The Center for Public Integrity and Transmitter Media. The new season looks at the racial wealth gap. The reality that the median wealth of a white family is eight times that of a black family and how banks have fueled this disparity. The Heist follows one woman who’s determined to bridge that gap. If Rashonda Young succeeds she could open the first black owned bank in the US in the last two decades. Check out season two of The Heist wherever you listen to podcasts.



Al Letson: From the Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX this is Reveal. I’m Al Letson. Today we’re revisiting our story that follows a supply chain of sugar millions of pounds from the cane fields of the Dominican Republic to our breakfast table. We’re also looking at the toll this is taking on the people who harvest some of that sugar. They’re Haitian migrants living in ramshackle war camps or bateyes.



Al Letson: When Sandy Tolan started reporting on the Dominican sugar industry the situation was a nightmare. He met people forced to work on sugar plantations guarded by men with shotguns like prisoners. He also found a spark for change. Here’s Sandy.



Sandy Tolan: I still carry the memory of him a child standing barefoot under a punishing sun in a place called Bateye Eight all stick limbs and sunken eyes. He was 14. It was 1991. And his name was Lulu Pierre. With my cassette recorder rolling Lulu told us he’d been kidnapped at a market on the Haitian border in broad daylight.



Lulu Pierre: This army officer grabbed me. I started to run but he was armed. They put me in a red Diahutsu truck. They were 25 of us in the truck. I was the youngest. They sold us to this place here. My mother and father and three borders didn’t know where I am now.



Sandy Tolan: This is just terrible.



Sandy Tolan: The men who grabbed Lulu as we reported at the time were part of a massive human trafficking ring aided by the Dominican military that had been going on for decades. Haitian and Dominican officials signed off on the selling of Haitian workers to cut cane in the Dominican sugar industry. The traffickers dumped Lulu in Bateye Eight part of a government owned plantation. The bosses gave them a machete and said “If you want to eat you’ve got to cut the cane.” But Lulu told me he couldn’t do it. When we met him he’d been fishing in the pesticide ditches beside the cane fields to try to get some food to survive.



Lulu Pierre: Today is Sunday. I haven’t had anything to eat since Friday. I can’t do this work. That’s why I resolved not to do it and see what God is going to do with me. I have to go home.



Sandy Tolan: My reporting partner Alan Wiseman and I worked with a Catholic aid worker to try to get Lulu home. For decades I’d think about Lulu Pierre and wonder if he ever got back to his mother. So when I returned to the island three decades later I tried to find him. Working with reporter Euclides Cordero Nuel I looked in the Dominican bateyes went to the Haitian border and to Lulu’s hometown in Haiti.



Euclides Corder…: Is it possible they were [inaudible]?



Sandy Tolan: We heard he’d made it home but we never found him. Turns out the story we found wasn’t about Lulu. It was about all the other people still living in the bateyes. As Euclides and I started traveling the country we learned of efforts in recent years to break up the trafficking rings ban child labor and hold sugar plantations accountable. Who ignited that push for change? As much as any one person the answer is Father Christopher Hartley.



Father Christop…: When I arrived in the Dominican Republic I had no idea whatsoever what I was going to confront.



Sandy Tolan: Father Hartley’s a Catholic priest from Spain. He arrived six years after my first visit. And after 20 years working alongside Mother Teresa he was so shocked by the conditions facing the Haitians in his parish that he began to speak out.



Father Christop…: These people live born and die in this same paradise but they live in it as slaves.



Sandy Tolan: That’s Father Hartley from a documentary about the industry’s human costs. But criticizing the sugar industry carried its own price multiple death threats



Father Christop…: Very explicit. One of them was tell the Reverend that the day he least expected he’s going to be found dead on a sugar cane field track with his mouth full of flies.



Sandy Tolan: In 2006 Hartley says he was forced to leave the Dominican Republic. As for his fight he just changed battlefields. In Washington he met a longtime official with the state department and the US Department of Labor.



Charlotte Ponti…: I’m Charlotte Ponticelli frequently known as Charlie.



Sandy Tolan: Charlie Ponticelli headed up the Labor Department’s International Bureau. One day she saw a documentary about Hartley and was so moved by his struggle that on her last day at work…



Charlotte Ponti…: I sent him an email before I walked out the door. And I said “Father Hartley I’ve admired your work so much. And if ever I can be of help to you please let me know.” Well he took me up on that.



Sandy Tolan: Father Hartley and Charlie Ponticelli decided to challenge the sugar industry together. They found leverage in a trade agreement between the US Central America and the Dominican Republic known as CAFTA.



President Georg…: CAFTA is more than a trade bill. It is a commitment among freedom loving nations to advance peace and prosperity throughout the region.



Sandy Tolan: President George W. Bush backed the agreement. It had bipartisan support among lawmakers. But not everyone was on board. According to State Department cables published by WikiLeaks US diplomats reported the treaty infuriated a coterie of sugar barons in the Dominican Republic. One cable said Pepe Fanjul was trying to sabotage the treaty to protect his family’s sugar empire. It was ratified anyway binding countries to the widely accepted standards of the UN’s international labor organization.



Sandy Tolan: With CAFTA in place and with Ponticelli providing advice Father Hartley walked the halls of Congress.



Father Christop…: Me in Capitol Hill it was like Mickey Mouse running the Vatican. She would be the one to tell me “Write to this Senator or write to this Congressman.”



Sandy Tolan: And he did something else. He filed a formal petition with the Department of Labor and to his astonishment and Ponticelli’s the department agreed to take action. They sent teams to the Dominican Republic to report back on the conditions in the sugar industry.



Father Christop…: The US Labor Department published its report which was tremendous.



Sandy Tolan: The report of was released in 2013 and cited evidence of forced labor and child labor many of the same problems I had reported on in the ’90s. Dominican sugar plantations criticized the report and especially Father Hartley. As a follow-up Father Hartley asks Charlie Ponticelli to travel to the Dominican Republic where she saw the bateyes for herself.



Charlotte Ponti…: It was like a nightmare. Workers are walking around with rags that are falling off of them. And when you think of the money that’s made off the backs of these workers the injustice and the stupidity of it you just want to say to somebody “Why don’t you clean this up? What… This is crazy.”



Sandy Tolan: The Dominican government was under growing pressure to clean things up. Some big sugar companies did just that. In fact one company Father Hartley had tangled with the Vicini Group reportedly made the most progress. I saw it for myself when I toured the Vicini operation new housing with electricity and running water buses to ferry kids to school soccer fields medical clinics in the bateyes.



Sandy Tolan: Still the labor department encountered resistance within the Dominican sugar industry. In follow up reports it said some companies weren’t fully on board with the reforms. I wanted to know which ones so I reached out to the Labor Department’s International Affairs Bureau. They wouldn’t give me an interview or release internal documents about this but other government sources told me the biggest obstacle was Central Romana. Father Hartley was hearing the same thing.



Father Christop…: They have videos photographs interviews. If the members of the Department of Labor who have regularly gone down to the plantations of the Fanjul family had the freedom to speak out and say what their eyes have seen you would not need to interview Father Hartley.



Sandy Tolan: The department contends that forced labor is still an ongoing problem in the Dominican sugarcane fields but officials won’t name names or share details. They say that’s not in their mandate. So we sued the Department of Labor. And late last year it released a batch of internal documents field reports that lay out some of the same problems we were finding at Central Romana’s plantation grueling work hours low pay and squalid living conditions. This leaves us to wonder whether offending companies that ship sugar to the US are getting off the hook. For its part Central Romana says there’s no forced labor in its operations.



Sandy Tolan: The issue of forced labor has been getting renewed attention in recent years. And some companies that export goods to the US are facing new scrutiny.



Speaker 14: A disturbing new report is exposing evidence of widespread labor abuse in the lucrative palm oil industry.



Sandy Tolan: Reports from the associated press and human rights groups prodded the US to step up enforcement of a 1930s law that blocks the import of goods produced with forced labor.



Speaker 15: Customs agents will be turning away products from China that they say are sourced from forced to labor in China’s [inaudible]-



Duncan Jepson: This is the first time we’ve seen this. And it’s pretty amazing that’s happening.



Sandy Tolan: Duncan Jepson directs the anti-trafficking group Liberty Shared. For two years he investigated labor abuses at one of the world’s biggest palm oil producers. Finally he convinced US customs officials to block imports from the company.



Duncan Jepson: This isn’t like sex trafficking for instance where the business is completely criminal and illicit. These are businesses that are public listed perhaps listed perhaps in multiple stock exchanges.



Sandy Tolan: Jepson says companies can use all sorts of social controls to keep workers trapped.



Duncan Jepson: We’re talking about coercive forces that are psychological coercive forces that are driven by debt. And that’s slightly more subtle than methods of violence.



Sandy Tolan: It reminds me of the two old Haitian caneros I met at Bateye Kakata. They had no papers no access to the pensions they paid into no savings. Their future? Work in the cane fields into their 80s.



Duncan Jepson: We’re talking about people who have very little financial resources and therefore they are very very vulnerable and fragile to any kind of financial shock.



Sandy Tolan: For Haitian cane cutters that vulnerability is amplified by deep racism they face living and working in the Dominican Republic. And these tensions go back many generations.



Eddie Taheta: The culture say that we are the children of Spain.



Sandy Tolan: Eddie [Taheta] is a Dominican migration expert. He’s says decades old racial violence and stereotypes create a racialized Dominican self image that says…



Eddie Taheta: We are white and we are Catholic. We are not black. We are not poor. We don’t practice [inaudible].



Sandy Tolan: These attitudes help shape policy. For years the government has resisted providing legal status for tens of thousands of Haitians and their children. Many of them were born in the Dominican Republic and are stateless. In this context. Eddie Taheta says few Dominican officials are concerned about the conditions facing Haitian caneros.



Eddie Taheta: It’s very very shocking. But I don’t think this is a priority for the authorities.



Sandy Tolan: Dominican officials say this is a priority. In a short statement the Dominican embassy in Washington claimed broadly that the government is making great strides in tackling poverty but provided no details about what they’re doing in the bateyes.



Sandy Tolan: The Dominican government’s failure to address many of the problems facing Haitian migrants means that some end up trapped. The human trafficking and child labor that I saw 30 years ago may be just about gone but as Duncan Jepson said there’s more to forced labor than physical restraint. It can be coercive like very low wages that amount to involuntary work. Another area of forced labor is debt from which workers cannot escape.



Congregation: (singing)



Sandy Tolan: One Sunday morning Euclides and I go to a bateye for an evangelical church service under a patchwork of red and blue tarps fitted to wooden poles.



Congregation: (singing)



Sandy Tolan: We’re with a couple. I’m going to call them [Efrain and Noni] because they’re also worried about the risk of talking to reporters. Noni’s feeling the Holy Spirit in the church they built for the community. She paces back and forth in front of the congregation microphone in her hand leaning back giving it everything. The entire congregation is calling out clapping laughing crying giving praise.



Congregation: [foreign language].



Sandy Tolan: Unlike his wife Efrain sits quietly in a folding chair. He’s a fumigator and says exposure to all those chemicals has made him sick. And in spite of Central Romana’s promise to provide free healthcare to workers he says he has to pay for much of it himself. All that has pushed him into spiraling debt.



Euclides Corder…: Yes I borrow money. I borrow money from people. Yes a lot.



Sandy Tolan: And so Efrain now owes 30000 pesos about $600 or nearly three months pay. The lender is charging them 10% per week.



Euclides Corder…: If you borrow 1000 pesos so you have to give this person 100 peso every week interest yes.



Sandy Tolan: Over a year that works out to 520% interest. It’s all connected. Substandard medical care requires borrowing more money. And that pushes families more deeply into debt. And with no legal papers there’s really nowhere else to find work.



Sandy Tolan: Noni says “We have to pay people we took money from. It’s never enough.”



Sandy Tolan: We spoke with more than two dozen cane workers who told us their low salaries force them into the hands of money lenders who operate in nearby towns. Efrain told us it’s a brutal cycle. The cane cutters are in debt until they die.



Sandy Tolan: I asked Central Romana about this. A spokesman said in an email that like other companies Central Romana has no control over the borrowing habits of its workers.



Sandy Tolan: Noni finds all this bitterly ironic given who is supplying the sugar that feeds our habit. She says “Haitians make the sugar. Without Haitians you don’t have sugar.”

Al Letson: As powerful as Central Romana is there are efforts to make it more accountable to the cane cutters and their families. That’s coming up next on Reveal.



Congregation: (singing)



Al Letson: I know it’s hard. You wait all week for this podcast and then it’s over and you find yourself wanting more. Let me make a recommendation the Reveal newsletter. It goes behind the scenes into how we make and report these stories. Subscribe now at revealnews.org/newsletter.



Al Letson: From the Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX this is Reveal. I’m Al Letson. This week’s show is from Sandy Tolan. He spent two years investigating one of the biggest exporters of sugar to the US the Central Romana corporation and the harsh conditions its workers face. Sandy’s with me now. Hey Sandy.



Sandy Tolan: Hey Al. How are you doing?



Al Letson: Good. So it seems like Central Romana has enormous control over its workers and their families people like Efrain and his wife Noni. What makes a company so powerful?



Sandy Tolan: Well I described it as a sort of state within a state so of course it’s got big political connections. For example the company’s former chief executive was the foreign minister he was the country’s vice president and the ambassador to the US. And looming over all of this is the Fanjul family especially brothers Alfonso and Pepe. They own a major stake in Central Romana. And back in the US they control directly and through subsidiaries the world’s largest sugar refiner. Their empire includes the Domino factory in Baltimore C&H Sugar many others. That’s why they’re called the sugar barons of Florida.



Al Letson: Okay. So your investigation looked into some pretty powerful interests in the US and the Dominican Republic. What happened after your story came out last fall?



Sandy Tolan: Well quite a lot actually. Almost immediately there was action in Congress. 15 members of the House Ways and Means Committee released a statement. They called on the Biden administration to stop these “outrageous and abusive practices.” The letter cited the investigation we did with Mother Jones magazine and also coverage in the Washington Post.



Sandy Tolan: And then Al just in January those same lawmakers took things up a notch. They called on three federal agencies to launch an action plan to address what they called the slave light conditions in the cane fields. Now it’s a long process but if there was a determination that there’s forced labor in the Dominican sugar industry US customs could move to block imports on some Dominican companies.



Al Letson: Those are some pretty strong words from Congress. What was the response from Central Romana?



Sandy Tolan: Well Central Romana hasn’t responded directly to lawmakers but all along the company’s insisted there’s no forced labor that it treats its workers with respect the conditions while not perfect are improving steadily. But that’s not what we found in our two year investigation. And this is where things get a little interesting.



Sandy Tolan: Al I want to take you to another bateye we visited. Officially it’s name is 82A but it’s known by most people as Ojo de Puerco literally Pig Hole. We went there a few times and this is sound from one of those visits. Ojo de Puerco looked really bad dank crumbling dwellings with bare mattresses or even just single sheets on the concrete floors. And like an estimated 90% of Central Romana bateyes Ojo de Puerco had no electricity.



Al Letson: That sounds awful.



Sandy Tolan: Yes. And then in November we got word that something was going down. Central Romana had sent workers with bulldozers and armed guards into the bateye. We got some cellphone video that shows how they erased the settlement to the ground. As for the residents they were loaded onto trucks and moved to other bateyes.



Al Letson: Wow. So the place was just wiped out.



Sandy Tolan: Al they pretty much erased it from the map.



Al Letson: Why would Central Romana do something like this?



Sandy Tolan: Well a company spokesperson said it was all part of an improvement plan that they say started in 2010. But the thing is people had known about this place for years. It was cited in a scathing human rights report back in 2015 and it’s hardly the only Central Romana bateye in terrible condition. Now at Ojo de Puerco the timing of the destruction was curious to say the least. It happened right before US diplomats were due to visit Central Romana’s plantation including some of the bateyes. And that visit came under provisions of an international trade agreement so the stakes were pretty high.



Al Letson: So did they eliminate the settlement to try and improve Central Romana’s image?



Sandy Tolan: We don’t actually know that for sure. The company said in an email that the bateye didn’t meet their standards and that the whole operation went smoothly. But again they could have fixed many of those problems years ago. They did all this after our story came out and with a lot of pressure coming down from Washington.



Al Letson: Did you talk to any of the residents?



Sandy Tolan: Yes. I reached a number of people by cell phone and they told me that they got no warning and were basically ordered to pack up and get into the trucks. Some workers also told me the families were separated in the process.



Al Letson: So what did Central Romana and the Fanjul Corporation say about all this?



Sandy Tolan: As we mentioned earlier neither company would talk to us. But in a short statement a Fanjul spokesperson said Central Romana is a highly respected corporate citizen. Central Romana says it’s also invested millions to improve the bateyes. Now all this sugar is worth a lot of money. And when it’s imported into the US the Fanjul’s profit in other ways. They benefit from low tariffs. And like other sugar producers they get an inflated price guaranteed by the US Congress. It’s something the Fanjul’s have lobbied hard for spending tens of millions of dollars to keep it in place. It all adds up. One economist said the US sugar program earns the family an extra $150 million in annual profits.



Al Letson: Wow. So has there been any other success in making the company pay attention to the problems you found?



Sandy Tolan: Well last year activists in and outside of the Dominican Republic learned that Central Romana was seeking membership in a pretty respected industry group called Bonsucro. It promotes sustainable sugar and its members include some very familiar names like Coke Pepsi Mars and Hershey. Critics raised an uproar. And in the end Bonsucro rejected Central Romana’s application.



Sandy Tolan: Now a lot of people have never heard of Bonsucro but its members include companies that have invested a lot of time and money showing their commitment to ethical and fair trade. If nothing else the optics are pretty important.



Al Letson: What are companies who buy sugar from Central Romana telling you?



Sandy Tolan: Our reporting shows that Hershey like other US companies does source sugar from Domino’s Baltimore refinery which gets millions of pounds of raw sugar every year from Central Romana. In a short email a spokesperson said the company doesn’t tolerate forced labor or unsafe working environments. Mars told us basically the same thing but they wouldn’t say whether they use Central Romana sugar.



Al Letson: Let’s say US companies decide to stop buying Domino Sugar because some of it originates from this plantation in the Dominican Republic. How could all of this impact the cane cutters and their families?



Sandy Tolan: Well there are a couple of ways it could go Al. After the Fanjul’s were sued for their treatment of Jamaican cane cutters in Florida the entire Florida cane industry mechanized and that effectively sent the Jamaicans back home. There is some concern this could happen in the Dominican Republic with Haitian cane cutters. Parts of Central Romana’s plantation are already mechanized.



Sandy Tolan: But there’s another thing that could be done. The company could improve the conditions now help the workers get the proper papers improve their access to medical care provide more buses to send children to school help them get electricity in the bateyes pay their workers more than $3.50 a ton plus a holiday bonus. Some of this is happening at other sugar companies so we know it can be done.



Al Letson: Sandy thanks so much for bringing us this story.



Sandy Tolan: Thank you for having me Al.

Now it is desperately attempting to backtrack in part by deleting tweets.

The Gravel Institute was born out of the 2020 presidential bid of eccentric late Alaskan Sen. Mike Gravel and explicitly styled itself as a counterweight to right-wing YouTube phenomenon PragerU. Its stylish videos have included left-wing luminaries such as Cornel West and Slavoj Zizek and celebrities like comedian David Cross and voice actor H. Jon Benjamin. It announced a new board of directors earlier this month featuring bold-faced names like ex-Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner and Jacobin magazine founder Bhaskar Sunkara neither of whom replied on the record to requests for comment.

In recent days the organization has issued multiple denunciations of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s attack on his western neighbor along with statements of support for anti-invasion Russian demonstrators and for Ukrainian citizens. The group hit those same points in an extensive statement to The Daily Beast on Friday.

“We stand in solidarity with Ukrainians and with the many Russians protesting the war denounce Putin’s act of naked horrific and unconscionable aggression and hope diplomacy can end the violence soon” the group wrote. “We stand with the Ukrainian and Russian peoples against the aggression and violence of the Putin regime.”

But just as it was debuting its new leadership earlier this month the Institute was pushing what experts called false or misleading material on its YouTube and Twitter accounts—material that sometimes aligned with narratives Putin and his proxies were simultaneously advancing.

On Feb. 18 the group published a YouTube video entitled “How America Funded Ukraine’s Neo-Nazis” which following online criticism was renamed “America Russia and Ukraine’s Far-Right Problem.” The video reiterated several of the Kremlin’s favorite narratives: namely that Ukrainian nationalism is a Nazi-linked phenomenon born in the 1940s and that it has taken root in Kyiv and the rest of the country in opposition to its pro-Russian east.

“Ukrainian nationalism formed in opposition to the Soviet Union tended to have a strong right-wing flavor” the video asserts. “In western Ukraine there was more stress on a specifically Ukrainian identity closer to Europe. In eastern Ukraine meanwhile people were more likely to stress their historic ties to Russia and the Russian language.”

In fact Ukrainian national identity predates the Soviet Union by hundreds of years stretching back to Cossack leaders who ruled the region in the 17th and 18th centuries. And in most of eastern Ukraine more than 80 percent of voters cast ballots in favor of severing the country from Moscow in 1991; in no area did preserving the bond receive majority support.

The video also focused intensely on the supposed power of far-right parties Svoboda and Right Sector both objects of obsession in Russian state media—and which respectively hold one and zero seats in the Ukrainian parliament a fact the Institute’s documentary omitted. While emphasizing the influence these parties held in the past and arguing the country’s neo-Nazis had become “increasingly powerful” the documentary made no mention of the fact that current Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is Jewish and a native Russian speaker.

In fact for several months in 2019 Ukraine was the only nation on Earth besides Israel to have both a Jewish president and a Jewish prime minister when Zelensky led the country along with Volodymyr Groysman.

But most galling to Professor Yoshiko Herrera of the University of Wisconsin at Madison’s Center for Russia East Europe and Central Asia was the video’s failure to explore Moscow’s interventions into Ukrainian affairs since independence. She described the video as “naive” and an example of the kind of “whataboutism” Putin promotes: pointing out questionable parties and pieces of legislation in other countries and thereby reducing scrutiny on far worse abuses on the part of Russian authorities.

“It is a strategic distraction” she said of the tactic. “Why would you put out a video like that that ignores the Russian interference into Ukrainian politics Ukrainian elections?”

The timing of the Gravel video released just as Putin massed armaments and regiments on the Ukrainian border and the U.S. warned of an imminent invasion was also highly disturbing to the academic. Earlier this week Putin characterized his unprovoked attack as an effort to “denazify” Ukraine.

""This alternative history of Ukraine I don’t understand why an organization in good faith thinks they’re going to put out a story that is consistent with Putin propaganda at this moment and think people are going to take this seriously” she said.

In fact the Gravel Institute does not even mention the deployment of Russian soldiers into Ukrainian territory in the aftermath of pro-Kremlin President Viktor Yanukovych’s ouster instead asserting that “the far-right helped the country to fracture.”

In its statement to The Daily Beast the Gravel Institute defended the accuracy of its video and asserted multiple experts reviewed its work before it went live on YouTube. It further maintained its video was never meant to be a comprehensive account of the situation in Ukraine but instead a window into an under-examined aspect of the crisis. It made a similar claim in a pinned comment visible below the short film.

“The video covers a very small slice of a much broader conflict” the group said. “The video does not claim to explain the entirety of the conflict a point we highlighted in the video’s pinned comment but merely to show how the American government ended up supporting and arming neo-Nazi groups that most Americans would despise.”

But this is at odds with how the group presented the video in one of its many since-deleted tweets where it seemed to hold the production out as the real version of events precipitating the crisis.

“Everyone is talking about Ukraine. But what do we really know about it and how it broke apart? This is the little-known story of Ukraine's civil war and how America ended up in bed with some of its worst offenders—Ukraine’s neo-Nazis” the memory-holed message to the nonprofit’s 375000 followers read.

Similarly the video’s description on YouTube characterizes the presentation as “the surprising under-told [sic] of how Ukraine split apart and the background to the civil war that has roiled the country since 2014.”

The video focuses heavily on the Azov Battalion a roughly 1000-man Ukrainian unit whose far-right roots The Daily Beast has explored in-depth. But the video makes no mention of the far-larger Wagner Group a Russian mercenary outfit with neo-Nazi links and ties to Putin’s inner circle. The Daily Beast reported in January that one of Wagner’s most effusively neofascist units which publicly shared grisly images of atrocities it committed during its 2014-2015 incursion into Ukraine had announced plans to return to the battle-ravaged nation.

The Gravel production highlights the under-regulated flow of American resources to the Azov Battalion before Congress banned aid to the group in 2018. But it ignores Moscow’s eager and ongoing support for far-right organizations in Ukraine and across Europe.

In fact when engaging with commenters who complained about the video’s bias the Gravel Institute insisted “Wagner is evil ofc but not known to express a neo-Nazi ideology” a comment they would subsequently apologize for and retract.

That was one of just many claims Gravel stripped from its social media in the past week claims that all seemed to echo Russian insistence that it had no intention to invade its neighbor. For days the group repeatedly attacked intelligence reports that Putin would send the vast military force he had assembled on the edges of Ukraine into the country.

“It is exceptionally clear that the American media wants a war between Ukraine and Russia. It is even clearer that the American media doesn’t know the first thing about either country” a vanished Feb. 14 post read.

The next day in another since-disappeared tweet it wrote: “A few days ago the U.S. government and media said that Russia would invade Ukraine on Wednesday. Wednesday is tomorrow. Please remember that prediction when it does not come to pass.”

“Remember a few days ago when the media said that Russia was going to invade Ukraine today? Whatever happened to that?” the group tweeted on Feb. 16.

The Institute expanded on this in a response tweet that went undeleted until The Daily Beast reached out for comment.

“They’re just printing whatever intelligence agencies tell them and the intelligence agencies are basically making it up” it tweeted.

The group continued to mock U.S. officials for their predictions and blame Ukraine’s problems on “American diplomacy” right up until Putin announced his intention to unleash his forces.

Then the erasure of the group’s statements began.

“It’s tweet-and-delete tweet-and-delete with them” said Sophie Fullerton a human rights researcher at Columbia University. “It seems like they’re just spewing misinformation to see if they get a positive reaction or not. And if they get a positive reaction they keep it up and if they get a negative reaction they’ll try to go back and clean it up.”

Fullerton began tracking the Gravel Institute’s activities since last October when it posted and then removed a tweet lauding late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi infamous for persecuting dissenters and massacring prisoners before rebels brutally assassinated him in 2011.

“Under Gaddafi Libya had free healthcare free education for both men and women free housing and ultra-cheap electricity. Libya under Gaddafi had some of the highest rates of life expectancy literacy and per capita GDP in all Africa. Then 10 years ago the U.S. killed him” the tweet read.

Fullerton pointed to Putin’s efforts to hijack legitimate criticism of U.S. foreign and domestic policy which she suggested had deeply influenced left-wing discourse. She also noted that despite the esteemed names that have associated themselves with the Institute the rank-and-file of the organization consists of Sen. Gravel’s very young 2020 campaign staff themselves Columbia undergraduates.

“People are attracted to the Gravel Institute because they assume these are legitimate people a legitimate organization that’s going to give them information” Fullerton argued. “But it doesn’t delve into the complexities and nuances of these very serious issues. It’s this really simplistic view of how the world works.”

The Gravel Institute acknowledged errors but insisted it was simply working off of Ukrainian intelligence reports and the views of some Russia experts.

“Where circumstances have proven us incorrect (i.e. on the invasion) we have removed our prior statements and publicly owned up to the mistake. That is and always has been our policy” the group said.

But it argued that its skepticism was justified based on the U.S. government’s own history of falsehoods and misconduct particularly since the 9/11 attacks.

“Our instinct to distrust American intelligence agencies especially when they speak directly to public opinion is grounded in their history of grotesque lies to justify horrific acts” the organization wrote. “Every one of these lies has been covered extensively by your own outlet and contributed to a very justified climate of skepticism and distrust.”

Professor Herrera of the University of Wisconsin agreed that suspicion and objections toward U.S. foreign and domestic policies are legitimate and warranted. Upholding a healthy democratic culture of debate while dealing with adversaries like Putin who promote division and diversion is extremely difficult. But acknowledging American and Ukrainian failures doesn’t have to mean excusing ignoring or downplaying Russian misdeeds.

Instead she recommended “focusing on solving problems rather than on critique.”

“We need a movement toward addressing and solving real problems in America” she said. “Let’s not substitute a discussion of America’s problems for calling out serious threats to us.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTAyLTI3L2RlbW9jcmF0cy1sZWZ0LXdpbmctZmxleGVzLW11c2NsZS1hZ2FpbnN0LXRleGFzLWhvdXNlLWluY3VtYmVudNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Democrats' Left Wing Flexes Muscle Against Texas House Incumbent,"Why did this happen?

Cisco Private 5G as-a-Service delivered with global partners offers enterprise customers reduced technical financial and operations risks with managing enterprise private 5G networks.

Cisco has worked in close collaboration with two leading ORAN vendors to include ORAN technology as part of Cisco Private 5G and is currently in customer trials with Airspan and JMA.

Multiple private 5G pilots and projects are currently underway spanning education entertainment government manufacturing and real estate sectors.

BARCELONA Spain — Mobile World Congress — February 28 2022 — Cisco today announced details on its go-to-market strategy for Cisco Private 5G together with partners fostering a new wave of productivity for enterprises with mass-scale IoT adoption.

Most businesses are beginning to realize the benefits of digitizing or ‘going digital’ – connecting their physical operations with information systems and using analytics artificial intelligence (AI) automation and machine learning (ML) to improve productivity and efficiency. Most businesses are used to connecting more people and things with Wi-Fi. What most businesses have not experienced yet – is what the power of Wi-Fi 5G and IoT together can do for them to connect more and do more.

The Power to Transform Industries

Alongside Wi-Fi private 5G and IoT have the potential to transform industries and redefine the future of hybrid work. Cisco views private 5G as a complement not a replacement for the investments businesses have made in Wi-Fi Ethernet transport and corresponding management systems. Private 5G is set to enable connectivity for a full range of use cases from factory floors supply chains university and enterprise campuses venues hospitals and more.

Cisco Private 5G

The foundation of the solution is built on Cisco’s industry-leading mobile core technology and IoT portfolio – spanning IoT sensors and gateways device management software as well as monitoring tools and dashboards. Open Radio Access Network (ORAN) technology is a key component of the solution.

The price an asset would fetch in the marketplace or the value that the financial community assigns to particular equity or firm is known as market value. A publicly-traded company’s market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the current share price referred to as market value. Because market values for exchange-traded assets like stocks and futures are extensively publicized and publicly accessible determining market value for over-the-counter instruments like fixed income securities is a little more complicated.

However evaluating the value of illiquid assets like real estate and enterprises which may involve real estate appraisers and business valuation experts is the most challenging part of calculating market value.

Understanding Market Value



The market value is a strong indicator of how investors feel about its future prospects. The market has a wide variety of market values ranging from less than $1 million for the tiniest businesses to hundreds of billions for the world’s largest and most profitable companies.

Investors’ valuations or multiples of companies like price-to-sales price-to-earnings enterprise value-to-EBITDA and so on define market value. The larger the market value the higher the discounts.

The Dynamic Nature of Market Values



The business cycle impacts market value which can fluctuate dramatically over time. During bear markets that accompany recessions market values plummet while bull markets occur during economic expansions soar.

Many more elements influence market value including the company’s sector of operation profitability debt load and the overall market environment.

For example if Company X and Company B both have $100 million in annual sales but X is a fast-growing technology company and B is a stodgy store X’s market value will be much more than B’s.

Company X may be selling at a sales multiple of 5 giving it a market value of $500 million. In contrast Company B may be trading at a sales multiple of 2 giving it a market value of $200 million in the example above.

A company’s market value may differ dramatically from its book value or shareholders’ equity. A stock is deemed undervalued if its market value is relatively lower than its book value implying that it is trading at a discount to its book value per share. This does not mean that a stock is overvalued if it trades at a discount to book value; it all relies on the industry and the size of the deal compared to the business’s peers.

The book value has a significant impact on its implicit value influencing whether a company’s stock price rises or declines.

Photo: PTC

At long last Pioneer Theatre Company has opened its pandemic-delayed production of the Shakespearean spoof Something Rotten! And with world news going from bad to worse every day this unabashed romp of a musical feels like a welcome vacation with a show that offers a surprisingly satisfying marriage of sophomoric comedy and smart wordplay.

The 2015 Broadway hit co-created by Karey Kirkpatrick with his brother Wayne (music and lyrics) and John O’Farrell (book) follows the misadventures of Elizabethan era brothers Nick and Nigel Bottom as they attempt to wrest a bit of glory from their nemesis Will Shakespeare.

Egged on by the neighborhood soothsayer Nick becomes convinced that the brothers’ ticket to fame is a brand-new genre in which—get this—actors burst into song. The troupe will out-Shakespeare Shakespeare by lifting the plot of the Bard’s next big hit. Unfortunately the soothsayer’s prophecy is slightly scrambled so instead of Hamlet we get the breakfast musical Omelette. A barrage of theater references and in-jokes ensues.

The score is a jolly pastiche that simultaneously parodies and celebrates the touchstones of musical theater from Meredith Willson and Andrew Lloyd Webber to Stephen Sondheim and Jonathan Larson. (As a bonus there’s a cadence in “Hard to Be the Bard” that’s lifted directly from Queen’s hit “Somebody to Love.”) Set pieces like “A Musical” and “It’s Eggs!” provide a fun test of the audience’s musical theater knowledge while a couple of songs such as the peppy opener “Welcome to the Renaissance” stand well on their own.

Matt Farcher finds nuance in the role of the harried Nick; he’s desperate to pay the bills and seething with resentment of Shakespeare’s success yet driven by genuine concern for his wife Bea and grudging affection for his brother. Farcher may be going for laughs when his character goes into stentorian “actor mode” but his powerful vocals help lift the show above mere farce.

Daniel Plimpton likewise delivers a nicely shaded performance as the nerdy idealist Nigel. He’s so earnest and sweet that you want him to succeed. Musically and dramatically he has wonderful chemistry with Farcher and with Lexi Rabadi who plays the ingenue role to perfection as Portia a poetry-mad Puritan. Galyana Castillo as the indomitable Bea invests her role with warmth determination and the pipes of a pop diva.

One of the keys to this show is that almost none of the characters have the foggiest idea that what they’re saying is the slightest bit amusing. The exception is Matthew Hydzik’s deliciously over-the-top portrayal of Shakespeare. He struts preens and swaggers like Jim Morrison Freddie Mercury and Elvis Presley rolled into one at one point turning the opening line of Richard III into a glorious sing-along.

PTC artistic director Karen Azenberg as director and choreographer of this show leans into the broad humor and never passes up an opportunity for a dance break. (The topical touches in “The Black Death” number work especially well.) The 11-piece pit orchestra led by Helen Gregory supports the singers with verve.

Patrick Holt’s fun costume designs include likely the largest collection of codpieces ever assembled on a Utah stage. And George Maxwell’s set design incorporates a clever and touching tribute to the late Fred Adams the Utah Shakespeare Festival founder who did more than anyone else to popularize the Bard’s work in this state.

Something Rotten! plays through March 12 at the Roy W. and Elizabeth E. Simmons Pioneer Memorial Theatre; 801-581-6961 or pioneertheatre.org.

Walcott’s father was too overcome with emotion to talk to NY1 as he embraced his daughter’s longtime friend Delia Soto near the memorial on Saturday.

“When we got the phone call it was just the worst thing in the world because we know she’s not coming home to her son her family” said Soto.



What You Need To Know Nisaa Walcott went missing days before police discovered her body in the Bronx



Walcott who was a single mother leaves behind a teenage son



Loved ones remember her as a kind eternally optimistic person

Soto was among dozens who showed up on Saturday night for a vigil outside Walcott’s home in East Harlem. Loved ones lit candles wrote messages of support and remembered their beloved friend.

“The way she died did not represent who she was as a person” said Soto. “She is full of life full of everything that makes people happy. She sees you sad she smiles with you. I just don’t know what else to say.”

When Walcott went missing last week her friends put up fliers and reached out to members of their community. They say they never imagined her body would be discovered on the side of the road.

“To know that someone you love was disregarded like trash on the side of the highway?” Soto said. “No. We have to have justice for Nisaa.”

Walcott leaves behind a teenage son. She raised him on her own alongside a tight-knit group of friends — many of whom are also single mothers.

“I pray her son could grow without being tormented for the rest of his life because his mom got taken” said Gizelle Cruz a longtime friend of Walcott.

Now Soto says she wants someone to be held responsible for this senseless tragedy. “When are we gonna stop hurting our women? Our mothers? We love Nisaa. We just want justice. It’s getting to a point where we can’t live like this no more.”

Although Walcott may be gone her friends say her presence is felt and they pray it never goes away.

“We’re gonna pray for her because God only knows that in his heart she’s with him” said Soto. “She’s an angel. She’s with all of us right now. We just want justice.”

Police say Walcott’s 21-year-old cousin has been arrested in connection with her death.

A missing roommate. And the man with many names,"First of two parts

Taylor Lange headed out on a damp chilly day a year ago looking for a peaceful place to relax and meditate.

Lange ventured deep into the woods off the well-traveled Springwater Corridor in Gresham when he noticed a man lying on the ground. The man was wearing blue jeans and a dark hooded sweatshirt and was on his side facing Johnson Creek. He didn’t stir when Lange shouted to try to wake him up. Lange figured the man was sleeping and moved on.

But when Lange returned the next day he saw the same bearded man in the exact same spot. He stepped closer.

The man’s hands were bluish purple. Lange called 911.

Lange’s chance discovery last March touched off allegations of stolen identity extreme betrayal and murder across two states.

Investigators were left to unravel what they say was a deadly thicket of fake names manufactured text messages and duped family members according to court records and interviews with police prosecutors and relatives.

Their investigation would lead to the arrest of one man police say committed the Gresham murder while on the run from the suspected killing of another man in Alaska.

At first though Gresham police had little to go on.

The dead man first found off the trail March 14 carried no ID or wallet. His pockets were empty. He had severe bruises on both sides of his head with jagged cuts on his forehead above his right eye.

IDENTIFYING THE VICTIM

The day after police were called to the Springwater crime scene Gresham Detective Brandon Crate returned about 5 p.m.

Crate carried a photo police had taken of the victim. He hoped to find someone who might recognize the man.

Police thought he may have been living off the urban trail near the Southeast Hogan Road overpass. At that spot the 21-mile path winds through an industrial area on one side and thick woods on the other.

The dead man’s body was found about 100 yards off the paved trail near the banks of Johnson Creek. Police tied blue rubber gloves to tree branches to lead other officers to the body through patches of swamp overgrown grass and blackberry brambles.

Shortly after the detective arrived he saw a man sitting not far from the crime scene.

He had on headphones and held a cigarette in one hand and a Coors Light in the other.

Crate approached and showed him the photo. Did he know the victim?

Hadn’t seen him replied the man. He identified himself as Anton Vovk and spoke with what sounded like a Russian accent.

The detective moved on.

But Coors Light and the name Anton Vovk would show up again soon in the investigation.

MAKING A LUCKY DISCOVERY

Several more days passed before detectives learned the identity of the man who had been killed.

Through fingerprint analysis they determined he was Anthony Alan Alcorn a 28-year-old originally from small Winchester Ohio on the state’s southern border.

Investigators contacted Ohio police to notify Alcorn’s close-knit family that he had died.

Gresham investigators then put out a routine public notice on March 20 naming the city’s latest homicide victim.

The next day Gresham Detective Aaron Turnage was investigating an unrelated case when he drove to the Days Inn & Suites on Southeast Stark Street.

He asked to see the guest registry. He scanned it and recognized a name from the homicide notice: Anthony Alcorn.

The registry indicated Alcorn had arrived at the motel March 18 and was renting Room 223 for four nights.

How could that be possible Turnage wondered. Alcorn had been found dead days before.

The detective asked to watch surveillance video of the motel’s lobby to get a look at who had checked in as Alcorn.

On the footage he saw a man pull out his wallet and show the clerk a card. It was an Ohio ID with Alcorn’s name on it a motel worker told the detective.

The man was accompanied by a woman with long strawberry-blond hair and had paid cash for the room.

The detective had finished watching the video and was still at the motel when he saw a man and woman leaving Room 223 together. He rushed to get photos of them.

The pair headed east on Stark Street and boarded a TriMet bus. Police shared their photos with TriMet officials to see if the agency could track them.

TriMet found photos of them stepping off a MAX train later that day at the Gateway Transit Center. Both wore black wool hats. The man had a slight mustache and goatee and was carrying a black water bottle.

The next day police executed a warrant to search Room 223. Neither the man nor woman were there when they started.

Amid belongings strewn around the room they discovered muddy pants and a pair of heavy boots caked with mud detectives said.

Police lifted up the boots. On the bottom each boot had a distinct bowtie-like impression in the tread.

It was similar they found to a boot print left in the muddy path leading to the body along the Springwater Corridor.

They also spied an empty Coors Light can on the floor.

March 31 2021: A storage unit linked to Hague contains the bag Alcorn had with him when he flew to Portland and Alcorn’s boots. Police also spot a Coors Light beer can in the unit.

She explained that Anthony Alcorn’s ID had been stolen. It must be another man she told them.

But a detective said the fingerprint analysis was incontrovertible.

Preston who lives in Winchester immediately wondered why her son’s friend hadn’t alerted her.

The friend she knew as “Jesse” had convinced her adventurous outdoor-loving son to move from Alaska to Oregon in early March for a job she told police.

Her son was looking forward to the work which he understood would involve travel something that appealed to him she said.

“Where’s his friend Jesse?” she asked the lead investigator. “Why hasn’t he called me? Why hasn’t he told me? … Is Jesse gone too?”

The detective replied: “Ma’am I don’t know who Jesse is.”

Preston wondered if her son had suffered a fatal injury at work.

But the autopsy revealed her son had died of blunt force trauma to his head with severe hemorrhaging. He also had a ligature mark on the right side of his neck.

It appeared Alcorn had been killed days before his body was discovered the medical examiner said. He likely had been hit with something flat or blunt the doctor told police.

Investigators had found two cigarette butts discarded about 18 inches from Alcorn’s feet. A black cord -- possibly a shoelace or jacket string -- was found on the ground behind his back.

DANGLING A JOB IN OREGON

Alcorn had met a man he knew as Jesse in Anchorage Alaska sometime in late August or early September 2020. They were both staying at the state’s largest homeless shelter set up in the Sullivan Arena the city’s hockey and event venue.

Preston told detectives that her son had lived with her in Ohio before leaving in August 2020 to work on a fishing boat based in Alaska with his cousin and uncle. Fishing was one of his passions she said.

But when he arrived his cousin told Alcorn that the boat wasn’t going out for what might be months. So he went to the shelter and planned to look for temporary work.

There Alcorn and Jesse were bunkmates. They found construction and odd jobs together through a temp service.

Jesse told Alcorn he was from Russia spoke Russian fluently and that he hoped to return to his native country one day according to Preston.

After a few weeks at the shelter Alcorn lost his Ohio ID card and other property. He assumed someone at the shelter had stolen them his mother said.

By late October 2020 Jesse was gone. He suddenly packed up his belongings and left the shelter after state troopers stopped by to talk to him according to detectives Preston and court records.

Before he headed out Jesse told Alcorn that the troopers were looking for his brother Aaron Hague but that his brother was in Russia.

Jesse kept in touch with both Alcorn and Alcorn’s mother by phone and soon tried to persuade Alcorn to move to Oregon for a laborer’s job where he could make up to $26 an hour.

By the end of 2020 Jesse convinced Alcorn and his mother that the company in Oregon needed Alcorn’s original birth certificate and Social Security card -- not copies -- before he could work there.

Jesse spoke directly with Alcorn’s mother by phone she said and asked her to send the documents to an address in Bellingham Washington in care of her son’s name.

Jesse also asked repeatedly if Alcorn had any felony convictions or if he ever had his fingerprints taken. Her son had a misdemeanor on his record but that was it she replied.

The requests made her uneasy but she said her son convinced her it would be all right.

“It’s a once in a lifetime opportunity” she said he told her.

CALLS GOING UNANSWERED

Alcorn flew into Portland about 5 a.m. last March 7.

Jesse had arranged the flight sending Alcorn a one-way $354 ticket on Alaska Airlines from a gmail account under the name “jessehague96.”

Alcorn called his mother when he arrived and told her he was going to a hotel to get some rest.

The next day he connected with his sister and mom on a Facebook video call while he and Jesse walked around Gresham sightseeing.

Preston recalled glimpsing Jesse’s face as he popped onto the screen with her son. He said “hey!” and waved she remembered.

Preston also noted at one point in the video chat that her son appeared to be walking in a heavily wooded area.

It was the last time Preston saw or spoke to her son though she didn’t realize it until later.

Police said they believe Alcorn was killed that day: March 8 in the afternoon or early evening — six days before his body was found.

But Preston connected with her son on March 9 or so she thought.

She had tried calling Alcorn repeatedly but got no answer which was strange because they talked almost every day.

So she texted him: “Are you at work yet?”

“Yes loading trucks and trailers now after training” came the reply from her son’s phone about a half-hour later. “Can’t talk. They are so serious about work it’s crazy.”

“Ok love you be safe” she wrote back.

That night she got another text from her son’s phone: “Loading into trucks to head out. It’s hard work love you and call when I can. … And we were told being caught on your phone is the fastest way to get fired.’’

She replied “Ok I will nor (not) call you you can call me when you can I love you.”

She received an immediate text back: “Love you.”

Preston received another text from her son’s phone on March 13: “Work is just doing what you are told. Food is good. Really good. … Got to go back to work lunch is over”

“All you can do is try and learn” she wrote back. “I love you.”

INCHING CLOSER TO FRIEND

As investigators were searching the Days Inn room on March 22 the woman who was staying there returned.

Casey Brissett told police she was staying at the motel with her boyfriend.

She said she had met him a few months ago on a MAX train and they had rented rooms at motels in Gresham and Troutdale and sometimes camped off the Springwater Corridor.

She said he worked for Mutual Materials Co. a brickyard less than a half-mile from the crime scene.

What’s more she told them her boyfriend used the American name Anthony Alcorn when he was in the United States. But she said he was Russian and his real name was Anton Vovk. He had previously lived in Alaska she said.

When police heard “Vovk” they quickly made the connection to the man drinking Coors Light near where the body was discovered.

They strongly suspected the boyfriend might be a linchpin in breaking the case but they didn’t know exactly how yet.

Then police showed Brissett a photo of two men — a photo Preston had given detectives of her son in Anchorage beside the man she knew as Jesse.

Brissett picked out the photo of Jesse and said it was her boyfriend. She told police she didn’t know the other man in the photo the real Anthony Alcorn.

It was then that detectives said they put it together: The boyfriend was going by three different names — Jesse Hague Anton Vovk and Anthony Alcorn.

But what was his real name? And where was he?

Detectives visited the brickyard and found that a man representing himself as Anthony Alcorn had worked there from December 2020 until Feb. 15 2021 — a month to the day before police were called about the body found along the Springwater. He had been hired through a Bellingham-based temporary employment agency company officials said.

Brissett told police her boyfriend had just left Gresham and flown back to Alaska for last-minute work he found in the oil fields.

UNMASKING THE SUSPECT

Brissett shared her boyfriend’s cellphone number and email address with police and allowed them to examine her cellphone.

What they found they said got them closer to the suspected imposter’s real identity.

They traced both her boyfriend’s cellphone number and the homicide victim’s cell number.

Based on location data the two phones were together soon after Alcorn flew into Portland on March 7 and were in the same vicinity the next day near where he died according to police.

Investigators examined the boyfriend’s gmail and social media accounts.

They said they found that a man using a gmail account in the name of Anthony Alcorn had done a number of searches on Google several days after the discovery of the body but before police had announced the killing publicly.

One of the searches: “anthony alcorn Gresham Oregon.”

Less than a minute later another search: “body found in Gresham.”

The others:

“Body on springwater trail.”

“Dead body found near me.”

“Serial killer in Oregon 2021.”

SEARCHING FOR AARON HAGUE

Gresham Detective Justin Pick the lead investigator on Alcorn’s killing did his own internet searching.

At home after hours he opened his laptop on his kitchen counter and scrolled through Alaska missing person sites. He plugged in “Anthony Alcorn” “Anton Vovk” and “Jesse Hague.”

He stumbled upon a “Save Alaska Missing” Facebook page. He searched for posts written around the time that the true Alcorn was in Alaska.

He found one that mentioned an “Aaron Mitchell Hague.” Aaron Hague’s roommate had disappeared and Hague was being sought for questioning according to the post.

The post included a photo of Aaron Hague. The detective recognized him immediately.

But to make sure he called Alaska State Troopers the next morning and sent a photo of Anton Vovk which he got from Brissett’s phone and photos of Jesse that Alcorn’s mother had provided.

A trooper confirmed all the photos were of the same person: Aaron Hague.

Police in Alaska didn’t know Hague’s whereabouts.

But now Gresham detectives had a name for the man they suspected had killed Anthony Alcorn and appeared to have assumed his identity.

They believed he might still be in Oregon despite his girlfriend’s claim that he had returned to Alaska. Detectives had checked outgoing flights to Alaska and found none in any of the names Vovk Alcorn or Hague.

They renewed their request with TriMet police and operators asking them to be on the lookout for Hague since they knew he and his girlfriend often used public transportation.

MAKING THE ARREST

Three weeks after the killing Gresham detectives Pick and Turnage got the call they’d been hoping for.

An alert TriMet video surveillance operator spotted a man he believed was Hague at the Gresham Central Transit Center. It was around 12:30 p.m. on March 30.

The man was wearing a maroon hooded sweatshirt jeans black wool hat and gray neck warmer. He was smoking a cigarette.

The detectives got eyes on the man they believed was Hague. They pulled up and saw him walking toward the intersection of Main and Division streets.

Checking the photos they had they confirmed it was the same man seen stepping off a MAX train after leaving the Days Inn earlier in the month with his girlfriend. He was even wearing the same clothes and carrying the same black water bottle.

They approached Hague near the Space Age gas station on Northwest Division Street and arrested him.

The man first told them his name was Anthony later giving his full name as Anthony Alcorn police said.

Detectives searched him and found he had Alcorn’s Alaska ID card and Alcorn’s Social Security card in a camouflage-colored cloth wallet court documents show.

He also had a Money Network bank card in Alcorn’s name and a second Social Security card in the name of Aaron Mitchell Hague according to police.

Investigators five days earlier had sent a dive team to search Johnson Creek near where Alcorn’s body was discovered. Just downstream divers found what police said they suspect was the murder weapon — a square-point shovel.

The shovel is identical to those used at the nearby brickyard where Hague had worked using Alcorn’s name according to court records.

A day after Hague’s arrest his girlfriend contacted Gresham police and led them to her Public Storage unit on Southeast 82nd Avenue in Clackamas.

She told them her boyfriend wanted to store some items there in early March. Video surveillance showed the two of them had gone to the storage unit on the morning of March 9.

Police recovered the red Embark roller suitcase Alcorn had taken on his flight from Anchorage to Portland and a pair of brown Ozark Trail size 11 boots he wore when he boarded the plane according to detectives.

They also found camouflage pants Alcorn wore on the flight with his boarding pass still in one pocket prescription pills in Alcorn’s name and a copy of a January 2021 tax filing completed in Portland under Alcorn’s name.

When police first rolled up the storage unit door a glint of silver inside caught Pick’s eye: an empty Coors Light beer can left on a cat tree tower.

BURYING ALCORN

In April a grand jury indicted 33-year-old Aaron Mitchell Hague in Alcorn’s killing charging him with first-degree murder and identity theft.

Hague has pleaded not guilty. He remains held in a Portland jail. Brissett faces no charges in the case.

Hague’s younger brother Jesse didn’t know that Aaron Hague was using his name had no knowledge of the killing and faces no charges police said.

Anton Vovk was a name Aaron Hague apparently latched onto after Googling Russian-sounding names court records show.

At a bail hearing last September Hague’s lawyer unsuccessfully argued for his release before trial saying prosecutors may have tied Hague to identity theft but lacked physical evidence directly connecting Hague to the killing.

“Suspicions and hunches are not inferences” said defense lawyer Jonathan Sarre.

Prosecutor Shawn Overstreet alleged Hague brought Alcorn to Oregon to kill him.

“He was basically fully living working and entering into relationships as Anthony Alcorn” Overstreet told a judge. “Mr. Hague was living as the victim.”

A DNA profile from a Marlboro cigarette discarded near Alcorn’s body matched that of Hague and a DNA profile from the other cigarette at the site matched Alcorn testimony indicated.

Alcorn’s mother dialed into the hearing from Ohio.

Preston said she always thought her son was invincible.

He had been the family daredevil she said the kid who broke his arm skateboarding down a truck ramp as a boy who needed 19 stitches and 14 staples to sew up his head after he crashed on a four-wheeler without a helmet.

He had been in a car wreck almost bled to death another time and suffered a blood clot in his leg that moved to his lungs Preston said.

He was the middle of her three children. After high school he attended college in Juneau Alaska but suffered grand mal seizures from his earlier head injury and couldn’t finish she said.

He returned to Ohio where he did factory work and helped out during summers on local tobacco hay and straw farms before going back to Alaska in 2020.

“Anthony beat everything” Preston said “… except for this.”

Preston and her ex-husband flew their son’s body back to Ohio for the funeral.

He was buried in his favorite Led Zeppelin shirt and a Cincinnati Reds baseball cap that Preston gave the funeral home to cover his head injuries.

Preston no longer allows her other children to communicate with her only by text after learning she had unwittingly exchanged messages with her son’s alleged killer.

“I have to hear their voices” she said “every day.”

The body of Nisaa Walcott 35 of East Harlem was found Friday across from a self-storage facility in Highbridge — an area known as a place where people dump “unwanted items” a police source said.

Nisaa Walcott’s body was found Friday in a plastic container dumped along the Major Deegan Expressway a few blocks from Yankee Stadium in the Bronx.

Police on Saturday charged Khalid Barrow 21 in Walcott’s slaying. Barrow a resident of Claremont Village and Walcott’s cousin is accused of murder and concealment of a human corpse cops said. Barrow was found in possession of “financial documents” that belonged to Walcott police sources said.

Walcott was reported missing Thursday by her brother Eugene Butler who lives in Atlanta Ga. But the NYPD is working on the theory she was killed shortly after she was last seen — on Feb. 16 law enforcement sources said.

Nisaa Walcott

“We’re letting the police do their work. We’re still uncertain what happened” Walcott’s sister-in-law Anginette Butler told the Daily News adding “We’re just in shock right now.”

Walcott was a beautician at a barber shop Live on Lexington run by longtime friend Norma Menedez who told The News on Friday night that the ghastly death was hard to comprehend.

“This is something you read about on the milk carton or watch on [Law and Order] SVU” Menedez said. “This is not reality. She had a family who loves her.”

Anginette Butler recounted that her husband Eugene “realized Wednesday night … something was wrong. She wasn’t answering her phone at all” she recalled.

She said he filed a missing person report the following day.

The sister-in-law said the family knows Walcott is a homicide victim but hasn’t been told the manner of her death.

The city Medical Examiner will determine how Walcott died.

“The people who killed here are just cruel to put her in a container like that” Anginette Butler said.

“Nisaa was a very kind young lady and she helped everybody she wouldn’t hurt a soul. We don’t know what would make somebody do something so cruel” the sister-in-law said. “Nisaa had no enemies and she was a good person a good giving heart.”

Adding to the mystery was that Nisaa told her son — whom Butler would only describe as a “young teen” — that she would see him after school the day she disappeared.

The youngster went on to school and Nisaa “left her apartment building and she never returned” Anginette Butler explained.

Walcott’s aunt Bernadette Butler Colon posted about her disappearance on Facebook.

“She has a wonderful son and a host of family and friends awaiting her safe return home” Colon wrote. “This is strange as she would never abandon her beloved son.”

The devastating outcome is overwhelming Walcott’s loved ones.

“She was a great mother she was an entrepreneur and she loved to do hair that’s what she did she was a young aspiring business owner” Anginette Butler said.

“This is just hard to process at this time especially being from Atlanta and this happened in New York” she told The News. “We are numb right now.”

Eugene Butler had few words about the stunning loss saying he was still trying to cope with his sister’s homicide.

“Nisaa loved her family and friends and she would do anything for them” Eugene Butler told The News.

“She loved everyone unconditionally” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vY2hyb21ldW5ib3hlZC5jb20vY2hyb21lYm9vay1uZnMtbmV0d29yay1maWxlLXNoYXJlLWhvdy10b9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to set up Network File Shares on your Chromebook,"It’s no secret that most Chromebooks don’t come with a lot of internal drive space so for those of us who are file hoarders – or simply like to maintain a thorough media library – we have to resort to other external storage options. But what if that external storage is in the form of another device you have at home – like a Mac or a PC – or a NAS (Network Attached Storage) and you want to be able to view or edit these files on your Chromebook while you are still on your local network?

Back in the day you were only able to achieve this by downloading a Google-created extension called “Network File Share“ but that extension has since then been taken off the Chrome Web Store and has been replaced with a feature built right into the Chrome OS Files app.

Sharing files back and forth between my Chromebook and my Mac Mini is something I do on a regular basis. Sure you can use Google Drive for this as well but I find it works faster to share a file directly within my local network rather than having to upload it to the cloud only to then download it again.

advertisement

That said follow the guide below if you’d like to set this up for yourself.

advertisement

Make sure the folder you want to map is shared

On Mac

Go to System Preferences then click on Sharing. Select the File Sharing service from the left and click on Options.

From that popup make sure you select to allow “Share files and folders using SMB” and select your user account. You will be prompted to enter your credentials for this macOS account. Enter your password click OK then click Done which should take you back to the Sharing services screen.

From here under “Shared Folders” add the folder on that Mac that you want to share. macOS already includes a Public Folder that you can use for this purpose but if you wanted to share a specific folder such as where you keep your movies you will need to add it here by clicking on the + then navigating to it.

advertisement

Once the folder has been added you will need to select what type of access you want to give your user account. If you want to be able to add files from your Chromebook back to this same folder and not just view what’s in there you will want to select “Read & Write” versus “Read Only”.

Note down the SMB path which you can see right below the File Sharing status area. This is what you will need to type in on your Chromebook when we get to that section below.

As you can see I have my Downloads folder shared as I use this to transfer files back and forth between my Mac Mini and my Chromebook. I find this easier and faster than sharing them via Google Drive.

I just want the steps! 1. Go to System Preferences then click on Sharing 2. Select File Sharing then click on Options 3. Allow “Share files and folders using SMB” and select your user account 4. Enter your password click OK then click Done 5. Add the folder you want to share under “Shared Folders” and select the type of access you want to give it. 6. Note down the SMB path

On PC

Open File Explorer and navigate to the folder you want to share. Right-click the folder and select Properties. From the Properties window click on the Sharing tab then click on Share. A Network access window will pop up prompting the account you want to share this folder with type in your account name on that PC and select the permission level.

Next you want to note down what the network path will be for this shared folder. You will need this for the next step.

I just want the steps! 1. Open File Explorer and navigate to the folder you want to share 2. Right-click the folder and select Properties 3. Click on the Sharing tab then click on Share 4. Enter the account name you want to give access to and select the permission level 5. Note down the network path

Mapping a Network Share on a Chromebook

To map the folder you shared on your Chromebook open the Files app then click on the 3-dot menu on the top right. Select Services > SMB file share.

You will get a popup asking you to add the file share. Enter the File share path – which you got from the step above when you made sure your folder was shared – followed by your preferred display name and the credentials you used when sharing the folder on your Mac or PC. Once you’ve filled all that in click on Add.

Note: SMB file shares on mac are preceded by “smb://” and use the forward-slash “/” to show sub-folders. On Windows it uses the back-slash “\” instead.

I just want the steps! 1. Open the Files app then click on the 3-dot menu on the top right 2. Select Services > SMB file share 3. Enter the file share path preferred display name and credentials. Click on “Add“

A new service center for the Palm Beach County Tax Collector office is now open to the public in the City of Westlake. Located at 16440 Town Center Parkway South the 23735-square-foot facility will serve the growing population of Westlake and neighboring communities.

On Feb. 22 Anne M. Gannon the Constitutional Tax Collector serving Palm Beach County dedicated the service center with a ribbon cutting and tour for invited guests. The building was designed with a modern look and feel and has a comfortable spacious area inside to service residents.

In 2020 the agency purchased 4.63-acres from Minto Communities USA the master developer of Westlake to build this state-of-the-art facility. It replaces an office that was located in Royal Palm Beach which is now closed.

“We are so thrilled that the Tax Collector chose Westlake to build its newest service center” said John Carter Minto Communities USA Senior Vice President. “Going forward it will be a lot more convenient for our residents to take a driver’s test register their automobile or boat or apply for a hunting for fishing license.”

“The increase in population in the western communities required a broad view of how best to provide services in the community” Gannon said. “Our priority is to serve as many clients as efficiently as possible and that meant building a new service center that can handle more clients. With the need for property to build a new facility at a premium we purchased the land in Westlake as it was a perfect location to build the new service center to provide a gateway to better serve our western communities” she added.

Westlake is approved for 4500 homes and over two-million square feet of commercial development. The Tax Collector office is the fourth non-residential development to open in the city since it incorporated in 2016. A fire station a stand-alone emergency medical facility and 7-Eleven convenient store and gas station have all come online over the past few years with more development in the pipeline.

The city council recently approved site plans for a new shopping center and cluster of restaurants known as the Shoppes of Westlake Landings as well as a new family entertainment center known as Adrenaline World. Construction on both projects is expected to start in 2022. A self-storage facility is also being planned for the 50-acre Westlake Landings business park. Nearby a second 7-Eleven store should be open for business soon.

Meanwhile Publix recently broke ground on a multi-tenant retail center that will be anchored by a 50000-square-foot grocery store and Christ Fellowship Church has broken ground on an 800-seat worship center.

Minto offers single-family and estate homes in Westlake priced from the $400s to $800s. Seven model homes are open daily for touring by appointment.

Westlake is located at 16610 Town Center Parkway North in the City of Westlake on Seminole Pratt Whitney Road between Southern Blvd. and Northlake Blvd. For more information on the community call 888-299-3628 or visit www.WestlakeFL.com.

Instead the company says the future of gaming is mobile with the mobile gaming sector growing much more rapidly than any other – even during the pandemic.

And Qualcomm would know: the company not only produces the Snapdragon chipsets that power a significant percentage of smartphones worldwide but its chips are also used in Windows laptops and standalone VR headsets like the Meta Quest 2.

Chipsets aside it also develops gaming-focused software features for smartphones communications technology IoT tech automotive systems and much more. You could say it has its fingers in a lot of pies so it has a good insight ino how the tech industry is developing.

“New console generations [are] coming out and yet mobile gaming is actually growing at a faster rate” explains Qualcomm’s head of marketing for gaming Patrick Perkins at a February 2022 roundtable and the firm has numbers to back up the claim.

According to Qualcomm mobile gaming accounted for a whopping 52% of the games industry in 2021 with console taking up a 28% share and PC gaming trailing at 20%. That’s an increase of 15% compared to the year before continuing an upward trend in the sector.

“The easy answer is to say it’s Candy Crush […] slot machine games things like that but it’s not”. Instead it’s the convenience of mobile gaming that makes it so appealing. “People want to play where they are”. You don’t need to turn on your TV or boot up your PC to play games – in fact if your phone is nearby you don’t need to move at all.

There have also been huge advancements in the quality of mobile games over the past few years.

While mobile games were once simplistic and light on graphics the improvements in technology – both on smartphones and the tech to develop games – mean you can now get AAA-level gaming experiences on a smartphone in titles like Fortnite and Call of Duty: Mobile without the need for a console or PC.

Importantly the experiences on offer are more in-line with those on PC and console with similar control schemes and visuals and even synced data.

“What you’re seeing is really an erosion of walled gardens and the platforms that we’ve [traditionally] had”.

Rather than hardcore single-platform gamers (think PC vs console) Qualcomm’s research suggests modern gamers care more about great games and they’re happy to switch between console PC and mobile depending on what’s available. “If you’re on the tube or your way to work you’re not taking your PC with you […] but you can play another game or even the same game [on your mobile]”.

It’s also important to consider the boom in cloud gaming especially as super-fast 5G networks become active around the world.

Streaming services like Nvidia GeForce Now Xbox Cloud Gaming Google Stadia and PlayStation Now allow instant access to console and PC games traditionally unavailable on a smartphone and the upward tick in mobile controllers means the experience is almost identical – albeit on a smaller screen.

“Netflix is just Netflix no matter where you access it” and gaming could be going in a similar direction dependent on developers and the available technology of course. That’s where Qualcomm comes in helping to build the tech to accommodate such a future.

On the mobile front that comes not only in the form of Snapdragon processors but software that manufacturers and developers can use to maximise the gaming experience on offer.

Qualcomm’s fourth iteration of Snapdragon Elite Gaming – an umbrella of Qualcomm’s gaming features – enables high frame rate gaming 10-bit HDR quality and desktop-level capabilities like updatable GPU drivers with notable new additions including volumetric rendering improving the look of smoke and fog in games.

There’s also new hardware in the works to improve the mobile gaming experience. At its Snapdragon Summit in December 2021 Qualcomm revealed a prototype handheld console made in collaboration with Razer.

At its heart is Qualcomm’s new G3x Gen 1 chipset with the ability to run games at 144fps in 10-bit HDR via a 6.65in OLED panel. It’s a great way to envision Qualcomm’s platform-agnostic future with the handheld able to run native Android games alongside console and PC games from the various streaming services available on Android. “It’s an aggregator of sorts” Perkins remarked.

Though it’s not currently slated for release the company has begun shipping developer kits to interested parties that want to develop on the upcoming platform. We went hands-on with the G3X Gen 1 device at Snapdragon Summit if you want to find out a little more about what’s on offer from the prototype.

So is it really time to ditch the PC or console and go all-in on mobile gaming? There are plenty of great gaming phones on the market after all.

Not quite. There will always be a place for PC and console gaming as those platforms will always have the hardware to offer an upgraded local experience compared to mobile.

“I’m not saying that dedicated hardware is ever going away … let’s say in a world where you’re streaming 8K through the cloud having dedicated hardware you’re going to get 16K. There’s always going to be a place for that but it’s going to get to a certain point where if you want that experience it’s going to be on a screen somewhere.”

Instead it’s about less tribalism among gaming platforms with more games becoming available on more platforms so you don’t have to “worry about how [you] play it or what specs [you] need it’s just the experience in your hands”.

Let’s just hope that future comes sooner rather than later eh?

However the last hardware that the company produced for wearables was in 2020 which was the Snapdragon 4100 and 4100+ chipsets. It really needed to refresh its wearable chipsets and it seems like the updated chips are finally on their way.

As per some new information coming in from WinFuture Qualcomm is indeed working on the next-generation Snapdragon Wear 5100 and 5100+ SoCs. This is not the first time we've heard about the new chipsets. Notably information about the new generation of Snapdragon Wear chips have been pouring in for the last few months.

Reports say that both the 5100 and 5100+ chipsets are being built on Samsung's 4nm process. To give you some perspective Samsung Galaxy Watch 4's Exynos W920 is made on the 5nm process and it is perfectly optimized to run Wear OS. Now that the Snapdragon 5100 and 5100+ are reportedly building on Samsung's 4nm process it could be even more efficient.

We might not see a huge jump in CPU performance in the Snapdragon 5100 SoCs

Qualcomm seems to be sticking with the same 1.7GHz ARM Cortex-A53 cores that it used in the Wear 4100 and 4100+. So we may not see a huge jump in CPU performance in these next-gen chipsets.

The GPU however could see a drastic performance improvement similar to the Exynos 920. Qualcomm is expected to be going ahead with the 700MHz Adreno 702 GPU in Snapdragon Wear 5100 chipsets which is an upgrade from the 320MHz Adreno 504 it used in the old 4100 series. Speaking of the difference between the SW5100 and SW5100+ chipsets it will also boil down to the packaging.

The Plus variant will be more compact and could be more battery efficient thanks to the QCC5100 coprocessor it comes bundled with. As of now there is no clarity on when the Snapdragon Wear 5100 and 5100+ chipsets will debut officially.

A second-round draft pick out of tiny Hobart College in 2015 Marpet became a starter at right guard as a rookie. He transitioned to center the following season and later settled in at left guard where he helped the 2020 Bucs win the Super Bowl and was a first-time Pro Bowl selection in 2021.

Marpet announced the decision on Instagram. He did not give a reason for the surprising move.

“After seven formidable years with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers I’ve come to the decision to retire from the game that has given me so much. This organization and the people surrounding it have helped build me into the person I am today” Marpet wrote.

“To the coaches and teammates family and friends an Instagram post simply can’t express the profound impact you’ve had on me” Marpet added. “I’m eternally grateful. Thank you Tampa Bay.”

The move comes just weeks after quarterback Tom Brady announced his retirement after 22 seasons. It also means the Bucs potentially may have to replace three offensive lineman this winter with Pro Bowl center Ryan Jensen and right guard Alex Cappa set to become free agents in March.

“I want to thank Ali for all that he had done as a valued member of the Buccaneers organization over the past seven seasons. He has played a key role in our success both on and off the field and we will certainly his leadership and professionalism” Bucs general manager Jason Licht said in a statement released Twitter.

“As the highest Division III player ever drafted Ali always seemed destined for greatness on the NFL level” Licht added “and we simply could not have attained the success of the past two seasons without him.”

Coach Bruce Arians described Marpet as a “consummate professional’ and “a rock for us in the interior of our offensive line.”

“It is never easy saying goodbye to a player who has meant so much to our success” Arians added “but I support and respect his decision and wish him a great life after football.”

Marpet had two seasons remaining on a five-year $54.125 million contract he signed in October 2018. He was due to earn a base salary of $10 million next season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL215LXZhbGxleS10cmlidXRlcy9ob2xsb3dheS13aWxsaWFtcy1mdW5lcmFsLWhvbWUvcmF5bW9uZC1qLWZhdXZpZS1zci1uaWxlcy1vaGlvL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL215LXZhbGxleS10cmlidXRlcy9ob2xsb3dheS13aWxsaWFtcy1mdW5lcmFsLWhvbWUvcmF5bW9uZC1qLWZhdXZpZS1zci1uaWxlcy1vaGlvL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Raymond J.

Hearings in federal court to determine future control of the Raymond Detention Center have been underway for two weeks and multiple witnesses have spoken about conditions of the jail.

In his opening statement James Shelson attorney for Hinds County called problems at the Raymond Detention Center ""an albatross"" that have followed the Board of Supervisors since the facility's 1994 opening.

U.S. District Court Judge Carlton Reeves will use the hearings to make a decision about whether to place the jail under federal control through receivership.

Here is a look at the history of the jail and where some of the problems raised during the hearing originated.

Trouble from the beginning

Since opening in 1994 the Raymond Detention Center has faced structural deficiencies chronic understaffing poor management and the issues haven't been addressed by county officials according to court documents.

Shortly after the center's opening Hinds County Capt. Diane Riley testified in a 1996 case about the jail that new doors were inadequate to provide security according to court records.

Over the years jail infrastructure has been linked to other problems at the jail such as violence riots and inmate escapes according to court documents.

During a 2012 riot ""prisoners destroyed fixtures and walls sprayed water hoses and fire extinguishers and left ceilings in shambles"" the Clarion Ledger reported.

In the article Hinds County Chief Deputy Chris Picou said ""it's no secret"" that door locks need replacing and he wasn't sure if the jail had ever been brought up to industry standards.

Several inmate escapes between 2012 and 2013 showed more problems with the jail's conditions according to court records. Officials blamed the escapes on faulty locks malfunctioning doors and conditions of the aging facility the Clarion Ledger reported.

Turnover in county officials

Malcolm McMillin was sheriff when the jail opened.

After the 2011 came a series of one-term sheriffs: Tyrone Lewis Victor Mason and Lee Vance until his death in 2021.

Following Vance's death Marshand Crisler was appointed interim sheriff and a special election led to the election of the current sheriff Tyree Jones.

There has also been ""considerable turnover"" in the Board of Supervisors Reeves wrote in court filings. None of the current members were on the board when the jail opened.

However District 1 Supervisor Robert Graham was a supervisor in 2014 when the U.S Department of Justice began an investigation into the jail. In 2016 he and District 5 Supervisor Bobby McGowan were on the board when the department filed a lawsuit against the county.

Investigations lead to 2016 consent decree

Hinds County Circuit Judge Tomie Green convened a special grand jury in 2013 to investigate conditions at the Raymond Detention Center. The grand jury concluded it was ""in a deplorable condition and inadequately staffed"" the Clarion Ledger reported.

In 2014 and 2015 the DOJ's Civil Rights Division investigated the detention center and two other Hinds County facilities: the Work Center and the downtown jail. The DOJ found the county was failing to provide protection from violence there was insufficient staffing and people were beyond their court-ordered release dates according to court documents.

What did the investigation find?Justice Department cites Hinds County over jail conditions

The investigation served as a basis for the DOJ to file a lawsuit against the county for failing to meet minimum constitutional standards at the jail.

A settlement led to the 2016 consent decree the county continues to operate under.

The decree also established a four-person team of experts to monitor conditions at the jail and give technical assistance.

County makes a promise as problems continue

By 2019 the DOJ filed a court order showing there was continued constitutional violations at the jail and how the county had failed to comply with most provisions of the consent decree. Riots stabbings a murder staff-on-detainee assaults have gone on at the jail in recent years according to court records.

Go deeper:Hinds County jail remains a violent dangerous facility DOJ says

In 2020 the county agreed to a stipulated order that streamlined issues for them to address at the jail. At the time the attorney for Hinds County said regardless of who serves on the Board of Supervisors they would have a constitutional obligation to follow the agreement.

""We are no longer going to kick the can down the road"" then-president Robert Graham said in a 2020 Clarion Ledger article. ""We are taking immediate steps for the health and safety of citizens inmates and staff.""

Since 2020 the Board of Supervisors has approved money for maintenance and repairs at the Raymond Detention Center attorneys for the county told Reeves during the hearings.

Despite the promise and approved funding the monitoring team documented seven inmate deaths in 2021 a record-number of fights and assaults and contraband in the jail.

Recent Jail Administrator Kathryn Bryan submitted a resignation letter in November Reeves wrote in two of his orders. She planned to leave in February but was dismissed by Sheriff Jones at the end of January.

An ultimatum:Federal judge: Hinds County must prove it can make Raymond Detention Center safe

Reeves cited the ongoing issues at the jail in a November order that called on the county to prove why the Raymond Detention Center shouldn't be taken over by the federal government and the county shouldn't be held in civil contempt for not fixing unconstitutional issues at the jail.

This month Reeves ordered Hinds County to be held in contempt after failure to make improvements and after the county filed a motion to dismiss or change the consent decree.

He had two years remaining on his $20.625 million contract but decided to call it quits after only seven seasons.

A second-round pick out of Division III Hobart College in 2015 Marpet emerged as a starter at right guard as a rookie and later moved to center then left guard.

He was a stabilizing force on an offensive line that now suddenly needs to be rebuilt. Both center Ryan Jensen and guard Alex Cappa are free agents.

Marpet did not give a reason for retiring although the decision is not believed to be injury-related.

“After seven formidable years with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers I have come to the decision to retire from the game that has given me so much” Marpet wrote on Instagram.

“This organization and the people surrounding it have helped not only fulfill a dream but also helped build me into the person I am today. I’ve made Tampa Bay my home and I look forward to serving this community in the coming years. To the coaches and teammates family and friends an Instagram post simply can’t express the profound impact you’ve had on me. I’m eternally grateful. Thank you Tampa Bay.”

Marpet had several discussions with the Bucs before reaching his decision his father Bill said. “From what I can gather he just wants to be healthy the rest of his life” Bill Marpet said adding that his son had no health issues.

“He feels like he’s accomplished everything he set out to do. I think there’s probably a lot of guys who want to do what Ali is doing. I think it’s courageous.”

Marpet signed a five-year $54.125 million contract with the Bucs in October 2018 that included a $2 million signing bonus and $10374581 guaranteed. He was set to earn a base salary of $10 million in 2022 and $10.625 million in 2023. He will carry a dead salary-cap value of $7.150 million from previous restructures to his contract that could be reduced depending on if he is placed on the reserve retirement list after June 1.

The Bucs already faced a challenging offseason beginning with having to replace retired quarterback Tom Brady. They also have some notable starters from their Super Bowl 55 championship team that will become free agents in a couple weeks. The list includes not only Jensen and Cappa but also receiver Chris Godwin tight end Rob Gronkowski cornerback Calrton Davis safety Jordan Whitehead defensive linemen Ndamukong Suh and William Gholston and outside linebacker Jason Pierre-Paul.

With Marpet’s retirement the Bucs have only two returning starters on the offensive line ― left tackle Donovan Smith and right tackle Tristan Wirfs. One of the Bucs’ best backup guards Aaron Stinnie also is set to become a free agent.

Injuries to Wirfs and Jensen contributed greatly to the Bucs’ 30-27 loss to the Los Angeles Rams in a division playoff game. Brady was hit 17 times including nine by outside linebacker Von Miller.

Brady announced his retirement Feb. 1 but left the door open to returning by saying “you never say never.’” There’s been speculation that if Brady does decide to return to the playing field in 2022 it wouldn’t be the with Bucs though they would own his rights.

Brady congratulated Marpet on Instagram.

“You are a warrior and it was an honor” Brady posted.

General manager Jason Licht would have a lot of work to do to convince Brady ― or any quarterback ― that he would have a chance to win next season.

“I want to thank Ali for all that he has done as a valued member of the Buccaneers organization over the past seven seasons” Licht said in a statement released by the team. “He has played a key role in our success both on and off the field and we will certainly miss his leadership and his professionalism.

“It has been one of my greatest professional thrills to see his rapid ascension from a small college standout into one of the NFL’s best all round offensive linemen. As the highest Division III player ever drafted Ali always seemed destined for greatness on the NFL level and we simply could not have attained the success without him.”

Marpet was a founding member of the Bucs’ social justice player advisory board and a longtime representative for the Bucs with the National Football League Players Association.

Marpet played every interior offensive line position for the Bucs. He started all 13 games he played as a rookie at right guard. After two seasons he moved to center in 2017. After the Bucs signed Jensen as a free agent a year later Marpet moved to left guard where he has remained. He wound up starting all 101 regular-season games he played for the Bucs.

“I can’t say enough about what Ali has meant to the team over the three seasons since my arrival” coach Bruce Arians said in a statement. “He has been the consummate professional and he has been a rock for us in the interior of our offensive line.

“We will miss him on the field and in the locker room. but I’m happy that he gets to go out as a Super Bowl champion and Pro Bowler. It’s never easy saying goodbye to a player who has meant so much to our success but I respect and support his decision and wish him a great life after football.”

In the end Marpet was ready to get to that life. He will remain in St. Petersburg and his father said his decision had nothing to do with the Bucs or anything that had transpired since the end of the 2021 season. Marpet’s last game came during his only Pro Bowl appearance for the NFC in the Pro Bowl in Las Vegas.

“This had nothing to do with the team or anything like that and Ali loved playing for the Bucs” Bill Marpet said. “I think they will tell you that they’re happy for him. It’s still pretty emotional for me.”

With FromSoftware the team behind critically acclaimed titles like Dark Souls and Bloodborne teaming up with A Song of Ice and Fire author George R. R. Martin it's little surprise that Elden Ring - the fruit of that collaboration - has been so eagerly awaited.

Now that it's out the reviews for it have been fantastic. However I was keen to see how the game looks and plays at 8K on TechRadar's monster 8K test machine.

As with trying Dying Light 2 at 8K I've been using the LG 55NANO966PA 8K TV for testing on and when combined with the powerful Nvidia RTX 3090 graphics card this setup can give us a taste of what the future of gaming may hold.

Hard mode activated

With 8K resolution weighing in at a huge 7680 x 4320 running any game is going to be extremely demanding especially ambitious open world games with huge enemies such as Elden Ring.

However we've seen recent games like Dying Light 2 and God of War come with support for Nvidia's DLSS upscaling technology along with AMD's rival FidelityFX. Both of these features run games at lower resolutions then upscale them to a higher resolution which offers better performance with minimal impact to graphics.

Both DLSS and FidelityFX Super Resolution have helped modern games hit 8K resolutions while maintaining playable framerates with some even hitting 60 frames per second (fps) at 8K - what we consider to be the ultimate benchmark for 8K gaming.

Unfortunately the PC version of Elden Ring is relatively barebones and doesn't offer DLSS or FidelityFX support. This means we'll need to attempt to play the game at native 8K resolution - a challenge as difficult as FromSoftware's notorious difficulty levels in its games.

The game is also capped at 60fps and while that won't impact how it plays at 8K as HDMI 2.1 can only support a maximum of 60fps at 8K anyway it suggests that the PC port wasn't a priority for FromSoftware. This sadly does not bode well for how the game can play at 8K.

Click for full 8K resolution (Image credit: Bandai Namco)

Playing at 8K

First of all I set the game to 8K with the graphics settings at 'Maximum'. The game certainly looked very good but in my tests the game averaged 30.5 fps. On the one hand this is pretty impressive and above the 30fps minimum I consider to be playable.

However there were some noticeable frame rate drops to as low as 8.3fps. This made the game feel rather choppy when playing. Interestingly PC players have been complaining about sudden fps drops at other resolutions and FromSoftware has promised a patch to fix that. We could see performance improve a bit at 8K then.

Click for full 8K resolution (Image credit: Bandai Namco)

But while Elden Ring is certainly playable at 8K with Maximum settings this is a game where fast reflexes really make a difference and at 30fps the game feels sluggish compared to the 60fps it hits at 4K on the same PC.

Next I knocked the settings down to 'High'. While this didn't make a big difference to the average frame rate which was only slightly higher at 31.6fps this time I didn't see quite as big drops in fps with 25.5fps as the minimum.

This led to a much more consistent performance and the graphical difference was minor enough for me to recommend this setting.

Dropping the settings down further to 'Medium' again didn't change the average frame rate much (31.4fps) which suggests that the engine Elden Ring uses just isn't suited for extreme resolutions. Graphical quality was noticeably degraded however with distracting pop-in affecting far away objects and NPCs (non-player characters) and rough edges on objects where anti-aliasing had been downgraded.

The drop in graphical quality and lack of corresponding performance increase means this is a setting to avoid.

Finally I tried Elden Ring at 8K on 'Low' settings. This gave me the best results so far with an average frame rate of 38.9 a bit leap over previous settings. However visuals again took a hit with textures and shadows being particularly impacted and prone to flickering. Again the impact to visuals wasn't worth the frame rate gains I managed.

8K dreams crushed (kind of)

So my Elden Ring 8K dreams were crushed. Sure it's playable at 8K at 30fps and it does look very good but this is a game you really want to play at 60fps. Dropping the resolution to 4K allowed the RTX 3090 to hit a steady 60fps with settings on maximum and the game felt so much smoother and more responsive.

Click for full 8K resolution (Image credit: Bandai Namco)

It is a shame however that the PC version of Elden Ring feels rather undercooked. Not only are their frame rate issues that impact players at lower resolutions but the lack of DLSS or FidelityFX support is a real shame.

Also while the art direction of the game is at times breath-taking it's not the most graphically impressive title out there. If you want a real 8K showcase God of War remains the game to beat.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnhkYS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLmNvbS9tc2ktY3JlYXRvci0xNS1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MSI Creator 15 review: A gaming laptop turned into a creator PC,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnhkYS1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLmNvbS9tc2ktY3JlYXRvci0xNS1yZXZpZXcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpemNoaW5hLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAyLzI3L2xlbm92by1sZWdpb24teTcwMC1nYW1pbmctdGFibGV0LWFsbC1mZWF0dXJlcy1rbm93bi1haGVhZC1vZi1sYXVuY2gv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2l6Y2hpbmEuY29tLzIwMjIvMDIvMjcvbGVub3ZvLWxlZ2lvbi15NzAwLWdhbWluZy10YWJsZXQtYWxsLWZlYXR1cmVzLWtub3duLWFoZWFkLW9mLWxhdW5jaC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lenovo Legion Y700 Gaming Tablet All Features Known Ahead Of Launch,"Lenovo will release a new gaming tablet tomorrow which is going to compete with the iPad mini.

This technology could mean that consumers no longer need to choose between the high-quality display and ‘never ending’ battery life available through solar energy.

4 Reviews

Garmin has filed a patent for an energy-collecting display module. The patent filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) describes how Garmin could combine solar charging and OLED display technology in future devices.

If this technology comes to life it would mean that users would no longer have to choose between the long running time available through solar power as seen in the Instinct 2 Solar or the high-quality OLED display as used in the Epix 2.

Garmin’s solar-powered smartwatches currently use a memory-in-pixel (MIP) display which has reduced screen brightness and depth of color compared to OLED displays. The partially transparent Power Glass which these devices use for solar charging would negatively impact the quality of an OLED display.

The proposed new technology layers the solar cells between the sub-pixels of the OLED display which should allow solar charging with a brighter screen than the MIP display currently used. However the interspersed photovoltaic regions might mean that this specialized OLED display would be darker than the standard OLED equivalent. Still there is no evidence to support this theory at the moment.

The patent application suggests that Garmin might also use this new OLED display in products as a handheld GPS device. It is unclear if or when the company would launch products with this new specialized display panel.

Gaga was nominated for outstanding performance by a female actor in a leading role for her portrayal of Patrizia Reggiani in the Ridley-Scott-directed murder drama House of Gucci on Sunday.

For more on the 2022 SAG Awards listen below to our daily podcast on PEOPLE Every Day.

Meanwhile Mirren was honored with the SAG Life Achievement Award. To date she is the most decorated SAG Life Achievement honoree with a total of 13 SAG Awards nominations and five SAG Award wins.

In her acceptance speech the star said ""Lifetime achievement sounds so grand I suppose I'm still alive so by that measure I'm eligible."" She went on to share her ""mantra"" that is behind all of her achievements so far: ""Be on time and don't be an ass.""

Mirren then continued ""Thank you S-A-G so much for this I hate to say SAG at my age it's always S-A-G for me"" she said as the crowd laughed.

""I am simultaneously enormously proud and yet with the understanding that I do not deserve this and there is the conflict I believe you all understand: insecurity versus ego. That cocktail I believe most actors sip in the evening as they contemplate on the gift they received the moment they decided to become an actor"" she went on.

Mirren also mentioned her struggle in knowing what to say during this speech: ""I've been angsting about what to say tonight and then it came to me: to all those people with whom I have shared my professional life the actors!""

NEW BERN — A former Fort Bragg soldier was sentenced to more than a year in federal prison Thursday for taking part in a widespread marriage scam according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina.

Samuel Manu Agyapong 34 was given a sentence of 18 months imprisonment and three years of supervised probation Thursday. He was found guilty at trial in July of theft of government property tampering with a witness visa fraud conspiracy to commit marriage fraud and aiding and abetting naturalization fraud. Agyapong also used the alias Sammy Tuga according to court records.

Federal officials said Agyapong a naturalized U.S. citizen from Ghana entered into a sham marriage with Ghana national Barbara Oppong in order to obtain food and housing allowances from the U.S. Army. For her part Oppong would get a lawful permanent resident card commonly known as a green card. The two were married in New York in 2015.

Officials said Agyapong purchased a home in Fayetteville while Oppong lived in New York and they rarely if ever traveled to see one another and never engaged in a legitimate marriage.

The release states that Agyapong and Oppong submitted fraudulent applications to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services requesting Oppong be given lawful permanent residence in the United States which she received. Based on the fraudulent marriage Agyapong received a total of $110000 in housing and food allowances over the course of the scam officials said.

At the time of his arrest in June 2020 he was a sergeant assigned to the 2nd Security Force Assistance Brigade at Fort Bragg. The brigade has a persistent mission in Africa and sends teams of soldiers there on a rotational basis.

Additionally bp chief executive officer Bernard Looney is resigning from the board of Rosneft with immediate effect. The other Rosneft director nominated by bp former bp group chief executive Bob Dudley is similarly resigning from the board.

The resignations will require bp to change its accounting treatment of its Rosneft shareholding and as a result it expects to report a material non-cash charge with its first quarter 2022 results to be reported in May.

bp chair Helge Lund said: “Russia’s attack on Ukraine is an act of aggression which is having tragic consequences across the region. bp has operated in Russia for over 30 years working with brilliant Russian colleagues. However this military action represents a fundamental change. It has led the bp board to conclude after a thorough process that our involvement with Rosneft a state-owned enterprise simply cannot continue. We can no longer support bp representatives holding a role on the Rosneft board. The Rosneft holding is no longer aligned with bp’s business and strategy and it is now the board’s decision to exit bp’s shareholding in Rosneft. The bp board believes these decisions are in the best long-term interests of all our shareholders.”

bp chief executive officer Bernard Looney added: “Like so many I have been deeply shocked and saddened by the situation unfolding in Ukraine and my heart goes out to everyone affected. It has caused us to fundamentally rethink bp’s position with Rosneft. I am convinced that the decisions we have taken as a board are not only the right thing to do but are also in the long-term interests of bp. Our immediate priority is caring for our great people in the region and we will do our utmost to support them. We are also looking at how bp can support the wider humanitarian effort.”

Bernard Looney has been a director of Rosneft as one of two bp-nominated directors since 2020. Bob Dudley has been a director of Rosneft since 2013.

Impact on reporting and finances



As a result of the resignations of bp’s nominated directors bp has determined that it no longer meets the criteria set out under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for having “significant influence” over Rosneft. bp will therefore no longer equity account for its interest in Rosneft treating it now as a financial asset measured at fair value.

This will result in two material changes to bp’s financial reporting and finances in the results for the first quarter of 2022.

First it is expected to give rise to a non-cash adjusting item charge at the time of the first quarter 2022 results representing the difference between the fair value of bp’s Rosneft shareholding at 31 March 2022 and the carrying value of the asset. At the end of 2021 this carrying value stood at around $14 billion.

Second in addition the change is expected to result in non-cash adjusting item charge principally arising from foreign exchange losses accumulated since 2013 that under IFRS were previously recorded directly in equity rather than the income statement. At the end of 2021 these totalled around $11 billion and this adjustment will not impact equity.

The change in accounting treatment also means that bp will no longer recognise a share in Rosneft’s net income production and reserves1. bp will no longer report Rosneft as a separate segment from the first quarter 2022 results.

As a result of the accounting changes and excluding Rosneft from base year and future periods bp now expects:

to continue as before to deliver a 7-9% EBIDA per share CAGR between 2H19/1H20 through 2025 at oil prices of $50-60 per barrel (2020 real) based on bp’s planning assumptions;

prices of $50-60 per barrel (2020 real) based on bp’s planning assumptions; EBITDA from resilient hydrocarbons and group to be around $2 billion lower in 2025 at around $31 billion and $38 billion respectively.

Financial frame and distribution guidance unchanged



As bp now is exiting its interest in Rosneft it has removed Rosneft dividend payments from its financial frame.

However bp remains confident in the flexibility and resilience of its financial frame underpinned by an average 2021-25 cash balance point of around $40 per barrel2. This includes reaffirming the guidance regarding its expectations for shareholder distributions – dividends and buybacks – out to 2025 that was given with its 2021 full year results in February 2022. This includes:

bp’s first priority within its financial frame is a resilient dividend. At around $60 per barrel and subject to the board’s discretion each quarter 3  bp expects to have capacity for an annual increase in the dividend per ordinary share of around 4% through 2025.

 bp expects to have capacity for an annual increase in the dividend per ordinary share of around 4% through 2025. bp is committed to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating and for 2022 intends to allocate 40% of surplus cash flow to further strengthen its balance sheet.

to further strengthen its balance sheet. bp expects a $14-15 billion range for capital expenditure in 2022 rising to $14-16 billion between 2023-5.

in 2022 rising to $14-16 billion between 2023-5. For 2022 and subject to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating bp is committed to using 60% of surplus cash flow for share buybacks. At around $60 per barrel bp expects to be able to deliver share buybacks of around $4.0 billion a year on average through 2025.

bp will also exit its other businesses with Rosneft within Russia4.



bp will continue to comply with all relevant international trade rules and sanctions. It continues to keep this situation under review.

The Embassy of the Republic of Poland in Abuja would like to reiterate that all nationals are given equal treatment and none are discriminated against. According to the latest reports Nigerian citizens are among those who have in recent days successfully entered Poland through the Ukrainian-Polish border. However we would like to emphasize that the situation at all the border crossings is becoming increasingly challenging and the time for a successful entry is longer with each passing day. It is therefore essential for all Nigerian citizens to contact their diplomatic missions covering Poland and Ukraine to obtain the latest information regarding the situation at the border crossing points.,,,

He was the man who urged Boris Johnson to include the ambitious target to end rough sleeping in the 2019 Conservative manifesto.

Jenrick also presided over the Everyone In scheme which protected rough sleepers in hotels and other emergency accommodation after the pandemic reached the UK in March 2020.

Now almost two years after the scheme kicked off Jenrick told The Big Issue it is an initiative that he is still proud of to this day.

“It was an amazing achievement. It was the clarity of message that helped from central government because it was so simple” he said.

“As a minister it’s something that was a rare silver lining in the dark cloud of Covid. It’s widely accepted around the world as one of the best initiatives that any developed country did to help the homeless during the pandemic.

“The majority of people who came in off the streets have moved along that journey some unfortunately have not and returned to the streets. And that’s a great shame I suppose it’s not to be completely unexpected. And it shows that tackling rough sleeping is immensely challenging and complex.”

The Everyone In scheme has been hailed as an imperfect solution but a success in the speed of response and building lasting partnerships between central government local councils and frontline homelessness charities and organisations.

But while it has certainly had an impact on the number of people living on the streets there is still some way to go for the Westminster government to hit its rough sleeping target.

Now he is no longer on the political frontline Jenrick has not been shy in speaking about where weaknesses lie in the government’s approach.

Last October speaking at a Conservative Party Conference fringe event he said tackling street homelessness wasn’t “high enough on the agenda” of some government departments.

And Jenrick was frank about what needs to change to tackle rough sleeping for good. One such thing of course is a “chronic undersupply” of affordable homes. Housing First is also “absolutely critical” the Newark MP added.

“The Prime Minister I always found was very supportive” he said. “As Mayor of London he took a personal interest as you’d expect in homelessness and rough sleeping and he’s knowledgeable about it. And its causes and complexity. He was always keen to support. Actually of all of the battles that I had with the Treasury this was not generally one of them.

“But of course one of the challenges that those of us who are involved in rough sleeping face is that we’re just dealing with the results we’re trying to fix things that have actually in many cases arisen elsewhere in the system.

“But it’s not where it needs to be. In particular it’s not been given the level of priority I think it needs from the Department for Health you really need them to be prioritising it.

“If you can bring health and housing together into a serious combined strategy then we’ve got a shot at tackling this.”

The overriding lesson from the Everyone In scheme for Jenrick was that ending rough sleeping and tackling wider homelessness really does just come down to political will.

The austerity policies of the last decade were undoubtedly political decisions which drove street homelessness.

But there are tentative signs that this decade can bring a more compassionate approach.

Since becoming a backbencher Jenrick has continued to campaign on street homelessness. In recent weeks he has been exerting his own political will on Priti Patel and his successor Michael Gove in a bid to banish the Vagrancy Act from the statute book.

This week the government tabled an amendment to the Police Crime Sentencing and Courts Bill that will see the almost 200-year-old law that criminalises rough sleeping finally axed.

“I think this was the first government for some time at least certainly since 2010 to really take the issue seriously and give it the prominence and the political support that it requires” said Jenrick.

“I’m still optimistic that we can make a lot of progress in this parliament. But what Everyone In I think taught me was that it ultimately all comes down to or it’s heavily influenced by how much political will is exerted.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhkc3BvcnRzLmF0L3J1bm5pbmcvcmVzdWx0cy1jb3d0b3duLW1hcmF0aG9uLXBob3Rvc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RESULTS Cowtown Marathon 2024 [+ Photos],"The LIVE-Results and official rankings from the Cowtown Marathon 2024 in Fort Worth Texas.

Assessments are the foundation of a good cybersecurity strategy. For end users picking the right partner to do an OT level cybersecurity assessment can be a challenge. A wide variety of companies offer these assessments today. The OT level cybersecurity services market has been growing substantially and many new companies have entered the ring with their own approaches and their own strengths and weaknesses from automation suppliers to large engineering service providers.

In today’s world of the long-term COVID pandemic getting engineers and technicians on site to do a vulnerability assessment can be quite a challenge. Just as we have seen a surge in remote operations and other forms of remote work in the midst of COVID the world of cybersecurity services is also embracing the concept and applying to various engineering services including cybersecurity vulnerability assessments.

ARC recently discussed OT level cybersecurity assessments with engineering provider L&T Technology Services (LTTS). The company has been conducting OT level vulnerability assessments for years and has developed a methodology for conducting remote assessments that incorporate standard methodologies.

What’s Different About OT Level Cybersecurity Assessments?

Cybersecurity assessments are a necessary part of the cybersecurity lifecycle. The first step in managing risk is to understand the current level of risk within a system. The process for conducting a cybersecurity risk assessment is outlined in the ISA/IEC 62443-3-2 standard. Normal engagements include a review of control system architectures and equipment to identify potential gaps in defenses and a review of current cybersecurity programs and practices to identify people and process gaps that might limit the company’s ability to maintain its security posture. Final deliverables include a risk assessment and mitigation recommendations. Physical inventory of cyber assets is a common option particularly for facilities with older equipment and immature change management programs.

Standards Guidelines and Best Practices

A good OT level cybersecurity assessment will conform to industry standards and best practices like the IEC/ISA 62443 standard and NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and will also perform key tasks like asset identification and risk evaluation.

While most service providers have their own cybersecurity guidelines end users increasingly request that assessments be performed in line with generally accepted guidelines and standards. This includes the NIST Cybersecurity Framework ISA99/IEC-62443 NERC-CIP and NIST 800-52/53. In some cases users may also expect assessments to include compliance with specific industry standards and practices.

A Unique Mix of Legacy and Cutting-edge Technologies

Industrial energy and critical infrastructure applications also contain a wide mix of proprietary legacy technologies and assets at the OT level that don’t always lend themselves to easy detection. These include distributed control systems (DCSs) programmable logic controllers (PLCs) robotics remote terminal units (RTUs) safety and shutdown systems and more. Many of these legacy systems are also quite old and some are no longer supported by the vendor. Many of these assets also bring other liabilities and vulnerabilities with them such as unsupported operating systems like Windows XP outdated computing hardware and firmware and older unpatched versions of various applications.

Conversely many industrial sites combine these older unsupported or undocumented assets with newer innovative technologies and systems covered under the Industrial Internet of things (IIoT) including new edge computing devices IoT-enabled sensors cloud-based systems wireless technologies VLANs and more.

IT/OT Cybersecurity Convergence

Lack of resources is arguably the biggest challenge for OT cybersecurity programs. It leads to poorly managed defenses and undetected compromises that provide attackers time to compromise critical assets and steal proprietary information. It is also one of the hardest problems to overcome. The global shortage and high cost of cybersecurity professionals makes it difficult to justify and recruit the necessary people.

Converging IT and OT cybersecurity programs can go a long way to resolving these issues. Most IT groups have access to a team of cybersecurity experts that can immediately fill the expertise gaps that plague facilities. This relieves the need for each facility to hire people with these unique skills. Existing OT cybersecurity resources can then be applied to tasks that need to be performed locally for safety and operational reasons. As these tasks only require basic IT and OT skills they can be performed by local technicians. IT cybersecurity experts can also provide any remote support that may be required to resolve specific issues that may arise.

IT and OT Still Have Different Cybersecurity Requirements

Despite the convergence of IT and OT approaches the requirements for OT level cybersecurity are different from that of the IT world. The OT world is more time critical often involving the control of hazardous process governed by safety or emergency shutdown systems. OT environments require high availability have complex change management requirements and numerous proprietary protocols. Patches and upgrades are deployed at less regular intervals and often require more special testing and in a much more controlled fashion compared to the IT world. With its large and varied installed base of systems software and controllers the world of OT also presents more challenges when it comes to asset discovery. Many of the assets deployed at the OT level can also be quite old with some systems dating back over 20 years.

A Broad Mix of Assessment Service Providers

Assessment is the most popular industrial/OT cybersecurity service. Most companies want to understand their potential exposure even if they are not always able to address deficiencies. Many also require periodic reviews of the security of facilities. Not surprisingly this market segment has the broadest mix of suppliers. These include automation suppliers control system integrators niche ICS cybersecurity service companies and IT/OT cybersecurity service providers.

Cybersecurity Risk Assessment

Measurement of risk and the adoption of risk-based frameworks and models are coming to the forefront as a way to measure overall levels of cybersecurity preparedness and protection. Managing risk and adopting a risk-based approach to cybersecurity is increasingly necessary in the age of convergence. There is already a proliferation of risk-based services and risk-based approaches to cyber insurance engineering and design through the industrial and critical infrastructure segments.

LTTS Cybersecurity Services

A subsidiary of one of India’s largest engineering conglomerates Larsen & Toubro LTTS provides engineering services across the entire “Design to Shop Floor” value chain such as Product Conceptualization Design & Development Testing Value Analysis & Value Engineering Product Maintenance Manufacturing Support After Market Support and Plant Engineering Services.

LTTS has been conducting cybersecurity assessments for manufacturing and the process industries for a decade now. The company conducts assessments based on NIST CSF and the ISA/IEC 62443 standards and has developed its own in-house security posture assessment framework that is custom built to tackle cyberthreats for connected products.

LTTS assessment services include a review of control system architectures and equipment to identify potential gaps in defenses and a review of current cybersecurity programs and practices to identify people and process gaps that might limit the company’s ability to maintain its security posture. Final deliverables include a risk assessment and mitigation recommendations. Physical inventory of cyber assets is a common option particularly for facilities with older equipment and immature change management programs.

The goal of LTTS is to guide end users through the various phases of cybersecurity program maturity which culminates in a proactive and managed cybersecurity state where both the IT and OT layers are continuously monitored. After LTTS conducts the assessment it has the capability to offer additional services including remediation passive monitoring patch upgrades firewall updates and network segmentation services. LTTS has remote security monitoring and incident response capabilities.

LTTS has currently conducted over 50 vulnerability assessment and penetration testing (VAPT) projects around the world for global conglomerates. LTTS has domain expertise across multiple industries from manufacturing to automotive semiconductors electronics buildings and smart cities. The company also has an innovation hub in Israel that works on cutting-edge security microservices.

Remote OT Network Assessments in the Age of COVID

In addition to on-site assessment LTTS has also taken many steps to automate portions of the assessment and to conduct remote assessments. In this age of COVID being able do a conventional on-site cybersecurity assessment has been hampered due to the pandemic and its associated travel restrictions. However the chaos of COVID is spurring innovation and service providers are coming with new ways to do more engineering tasks remotely than could ever be done before.

To address these increased requirements for remote work LTTS has developed a remote OT vulnerability assessment methodology. Working with a single point of contact within the end user organization LTTS can remotely execute an assessment from discovery and packet capture through inspection analysis and reporting. The company also has the capability to expand on these assessment capabilities to help the end user implement managed cybersecurity services for a more proactive and continuous threat monitoring posture.

Discovery Meeting

LTTS remote vulnerability assessments start with a discovery meeting which includes project awareness presentations and a review of the OT network topology. The team reviews the overall OT process and its critical output and reviews any network tools that are already in place. The team then identifies required network tapping points and determines tapping duration time. Other information like OT network design IP schema a list of known automation vendors and systems in place and a list of known OT protocols in place is also provided and reviewed.

Packet Capture

LTTS guides the plant team through the process of running packet captures on the relevant tapping points. Packet capture files are then uploaded to a secure location for retrieval by LTTS.

Inspect and Analyze

LTTS processes the packet captures and performs an analysis. A standard compliance audit is performed via a remote session.

Reporting

Once the packet analysis and standard compliance audit are performed LTTS builds a comprehensive OT security assessment report to share any relevant insights and information from the assessment. The company also provides suggested remediations to identified issues.

Assessment reports include key insights from LTTS including asset inventory lists and interaction maps per the Purdue Model. An asset communication protocol map is also provided along with type firmware and vendor details. Along with an asset breakdown by vendor the report includes a list of known vulnerabilities with CVE details and highlights of major security gaps in the installation.

Lifecycle Capabilities Beyond Assessment

Assessments also don’t end after the assessment. LTTS offers many other cybersecurity services after the assessment that can guide end users to a more proactive cybersecurity posture. As part of its SOC as a Service offering LTTS can continuously monitor and improve an organization’s security posture while preventing detecting analyzing and responding to cybersecurity incidents.

Case Studies

Consumer Products

LTTS has implemented its remote assessment methodology at many customer sites. One recent success was at a large global consumer goods manufacturer. This assessment was both an IT and OT level assessment that identified assets and associated risks. LTTS conducted verification of network topology and IT and OT network segmentation.

Since this was a combined IT/OT audit LTTS did audit scans on IT elements to identify major vulnerabilities. They also completed audit scans and manual verifications for critical OT entities like MES systems control systems and the ability of AGVs to identify major vulnerabilities. The OT portion of the assessment followed NIST guidelines. After the assessment LTTS provided remediations to the end user for identified vulnerabilities and provided further recommendations for continuous monitoring and notification systems.

Food & Beverage

LTTS completed another recent remote vulnerability assessment for a global tobacco major. Like the consumer products project this case study included an assessment of both IT and OT assets. Automated scans were conducted both for the IT assets and for selected OT assets during non-production hours. Passive network traffic monitoring of select OT subnets were conducted at the site as well as site access point scan and verification.

This project also included access control list (ACL) verification and firewall architecture validation. LTTS also used active scanning techniques in this project for its IT network scans. Key recommendations for this project included implementation of continuous monitoring and notification systems.

Private 5G Network Assessment

Privately deployed 5G networks are already making inroads on the shop floor. LTTS recently completed an independent security assessment of one proposed private 5G network at a major electronics manufacturer to reduce the risks associated with operating these technologies and enable the customer to implement a robust and secure 5G network.

LTTS provided a security assessment of 5G network components and developed security test cases for each component of the 5G network. The company also reviewed the overall architecture of the network being deployed to ensure that it was inline with the end user’s overall cybersecurity requirements. LTTS also reviewed firewall requirements maintenance and service contracts with suppliers and recommended an end-to-end threat monitoring solution.

Recommendations

It’s important to evaluate the capabilities and expertise of potential partners to ensure that they understand the requirements of your industry and relevant standards and best practices but it’s also important for end users to understand that assessments are the first step in a cybersecurity lifecycle. Assessments establish asset inventories performance baselines and really should provide a comprehensive picture of the end user’s overall cybersecurity posture.

Assessments are just one step in the overall cybersecurity lifecycle and flows into the implementation and maintenance/operations phases. Any potential assessment partners should view it in this context and provide you with guidance about how to use the information gathered in the assessment to remediate issues implement solutions and provide value throughout the maintenance and operations phases of your plant or facility.

Remote assessments are a great way to take advantage of the current suite of technologies pinpoint key vulnerabilities and develop a more solid cybersecurity posture without the requirement and associated cost of on-site engineers. Good remote assessments require adequate coordination between the assessment provider and the end user so ARC recommends that end users develop a full understanding of the remote service offering including what’s expected of the end user in terms of their project responsibilities and work processes required.

Henry B. Tippie

Henry B. Tippie passed away peacefully on February 20 2022.

Henry was born on a farm near Belle Plaine Iowa on January 5 1927 to Robert and Amelia Tippie. He attended a one-room schoolhouse through the eighth grade and graduated from Belle Plaine High School in 1944. He enlisted at age 17 in the Army Air Forces. He received the Army Commendation Medal while stationed in Guam. The World War II G.I. Bill made it possible for him to attend The University of Iowa graduating in August 1949 with an accounting degree after 24 consecutive calendar months of study.

In 1955 he met his future partner and best friend Patricia Bush from New Castle Pennsylvania. They were married on June 27 1956 and became the parents of Henry II Helen and Linda. In 2005 he funded the Patricia Bush Tippie Alumni Center at Allegheny College in her honor.

He obtained his first employment in Des Moines Iowa with a small accounting firm. After gaining enough experience to take the CPA test he moved to Omaha Nebraska joining a large regional CPA firm. In early 1953 he joined John W. and O. Wayne Rollins in Rehoboth Beach Delaware. He was instrumental in taking the first Rollins company public in 1960 known as Rollins Broadcasting Inc. Later Rollins purchased Orkin Exterminating Company Inc. considered the first major leveraged buyout in American business history. He was a co-incorporator of Rollins Truck Leasing Corp. which became the third-largest company of its type in the United States. Henry also provided leadership for several decades to Dover Motorsports; a NASCAR sanctioned motorsports events promoter.

Henry moved to Austin Texas in 1971 and set up Kingstip Inc. the first Austin Texas headquartered company listed on any major stock exchange. This company consisted of Kingstip Communications owner of the Austin NBC and Featherlite Building Products. Later he formed Tippie Communications Inc. which owned radio stations in the Texas Rio Grande Valley Corpus Christi and Colorado Springs.

He was involved with 12 different publicly owned companies during his business career. Almost all were small companies and for the most part had not had any prior history of success. Ultimately many became large companies including several listed on the New York Stock Exchange. He got great enjoyment in taking other people's business failures and making them successful. The New York Stock Exchange inducted Henry into the Wall of Fame in 2018.

In 1973 Henry established Tippie Ranch near Georgetown Texas with subsequent expansion in 1984 to Limestone County. He always felt agriculture kept him down to earth and enjoyed his relationships with the people in the rural areas. Ranching provided a constant reminder of growing up on a dairy farm in Iowa.

Henry was a strong believer in education. Over the years he provided over 900 scholarships professorships faculty chairs and fellowships at The University of Iowa Kirkwood Community College Coe College and Allegheny College. The University of Iowa College of Business was renamed the Henry B. Tippie College of Business in 1999. He received an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters at The University of Iowa and Allegheny College. In 2021 Henry and Patricia received The Council of Independent Colleges Award for Philanthropy. Henry has been a Life Member of the Commemorative Air Force since 1977 and last year on Veterans Day the Henry B. Tippie National Aviation Education Center was dedicated in Dallas. The Center focuses on hands-on experiential learning grounded in Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM).

He received the Horatio Alger Award in 1996 honoring those who come from humble beginnings and become leaders in their professions. He was later elected to the Junior Achievement Eastern Iowa Hall of Fame.

Henry was a long-time member of the St. John's United Methodist Church in Austin Texas. He was a 32nd Degree Mason a member of the Granite-Corinthian Lodge #34 the Delaware Consistory and the NUR Shrine in Wilmington Delaware. Henry was a life member of the American Legion VFW Iowa Society of CPAs American Accounting Association and Financial Executives Institute.

While he never moved back to Iowa Henry always remembered his roots. He supported his hometown as a contributor to the Belle Plaine Iowa Community Library the Mansfield Tippie Airport and the Belle Plaine Museum. The museum added the Henry B. Tippie Annex with memorabilia from his childhood to his 90th birthday.

Henry is survived by his wife Patricia; son Henry II and his wife Judie and grandchildren Ashley Abbie and Henry III; daughter Helen and her husband Brian Smith and grandchildren Blake Travis and Holly; daughter Linda and her husband James Forrest and grandchildren Kyle John and Michael; together with 11 great-grandchildren. Preceding in death were his parents Robert W. and Amelia Bokholt Tippie; and brothers Ernest and Robert.

Visitation will be held at Hrabak-Neuhaus Funeral Service 1704 7th Ave Belle Plaine Iowa Friday March 4 5-7 PM. Online condolences can be sent to the family at www.neuhausfuneralservice.com

Celebration of Life Service will be Saturday March 5 10:30 AM. with military honors. Service will also be live streamed through Hrabak-Neuhaus Funeral Service Facebook page. Private family burial will take place at Oak Hill Cemetery Belle Plaine.

As seen in Seth Rollins' tweet below the former WWE Champion is assuring fans that he and Kevin Owens will have a match for the RAW Tag Team Championships at WrestleMania 38.

This is interesting because there have been numerous reports lately that claim ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin was possibly returning at WrestleMania for a feud with Kevin Owens. That would explain why Owens has been repeatedly bashing Texas during recent promos in an effort to anger ""the Texas rattlesnake"".

But if what Rollins says online is true it looks as though we may see Owens in a tag match at WrestleMania this year instead of a match with the Hall of Famer.

The rapper has now given us a glimpse of his blue garage after having shown us his black and red ones.

When you own over one hundred vehicles you definitely need a lot of space to store them. That’s not a problem for rapper and record executive Rick Ross. Besides investing a big part of his salaries in his rides he also has a 235-acre property in Atlanta Georgia called “The Promise Land.”Besides collecting cars one of his hobbies is showing them on social media and he thought “Why not have a car show?” So his main goal for 2022 was to create the first edition of the Rick Ross Car Show. He formally announced the event a couple of weeks ago  which will happen at his home on May 21.In a new series of short videos posted on his Instagram Stories on February 26 Ross gives us a look at his blue garage which naturally includes a lot of classic Chevys. Right in the center stage it’s a Bel Air of course and several other models.But he also talks about the upcoming car show which seems to keep him busy recently. He begins: ""May 21st the biggest car show of the year."" He added that next Friday we will be getting access to all the information about the event there will also be an official website and details on how to register for it “it's going down in a major way” Ross says proudly. He added “I’m gonna show my car collection ""from my foreigns my exotics to my classics.""After finishing with his garage  he also gave us a glimpse of all the remote-controlled toys he has from cars tanks to planes. After that he went outside and shown us his Can-Am a Yamaha and a couple of vans.This all comes after he single-handedly cut the trees on his property after a company asked him for $1000 per tree so he decided to save up. After that he hopped on his Yamaha four-wheeler and started doing donuts.

Since the company returned to operations in the United States a year ago more than a million guests have sailed onboard the ships. The company brought more than 28000 crew members back to sea and has managed to stay operational despite many challenges being thrown at it. We look at the numbers and what needs to happen before Royal Caribbean completes its service return.

One Million Guests Aboard Twenty-One Cruise Ships

Since Quantum of the Seas commenced operations in Singapore more than one million guests have sailed onboard a Royal Caribbean cruise ship. While that number may not sound like a big deal considering the fact that most ships did not start operating en masse until July of 2021 the build-up is quite something.

Freedom of the Seas was the first ship in the fleet to start operations in the United States on July 2 2021. She sailed from Miami and stopped in Nassau the Bahamas and Royal Caribbean’s private island Perfect Day at CocoCay.

At Royal Caribbean’s private island we start seeing some really incredible numbers. Out of the one million guests that sailed onboard a Royal Caribbean ship 502411 guests spent one or two days at Perfect Day at Cococay. This was done during one of the 257 stops at the island.

Over 6500 zipline rides were enjoyed by guests. There were 80070 guests who enjoyed the slides rope lines and wave pools at Thrill waterpark. The helium-filled balloon ride called Up Up Away has taken more than 1500 guests over 450 feet above land and sea to see the Bahamas.

The twenty-one cruise ships now in service have embarked more than one million passengers from twenty-four different homeports. They are spread across the Mediterranean the United Kingdom the Bahamas the Caribbean Singapore Hong Kong and the United States.

In exactly one week from now the cruise line’s newest ship and the biggest cruise ship in the world Wonder of the Seas will start operations.

Seven Ships Remaining For Royal Caribbean

Only seven ships remain to bring the fleet up to full operating capacity. These are Wonder of the Seas starting March 4. Vision of the Seas will return to operations on March 7. After that the wait is for Spectrum of the Seas Serenade of the Seas Rhapsody of the Seas Voyager of the Seas and Radiance of the Seas.

Wonder of the Seas will sail her maiden voyage one week from now on March 4 from Port Everglades Fort Lauderdale. She will remain here during March and April and then reposition for her summer season in Europe. At 236857 and with space for 5734 guests she is the largest cruise ship at sea today.

Vision of the Seas will resume on March 7; departing from Port Everglades she will sail an 11-day cruise with port calls in Puerto Limon Costa Rica; Colon Panama; Cartagena Colombia; Oranjestad Aruba; and Willemstad Curacao.

In April Royal Caribbean will be bringing the last ships online marking the end of twenty-five months of cruise bans.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzZGFpbHlhZnJpY2EuY29tL2JkL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9mb29kLWRyaW5rcy9hLWR1YmFpLWhvdGVsLXNlcnZpbmctdWdhbGktbXV0dXJhLWFuZC1hbGwtMzcyODMyNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Dubai hotel serving ugali mutura and all,"I had eaten Asian and Arabian food weird-tasting perhaps because my palate is not really into extra spicy and oily dishes before we sat at this African restaurant in Dubai.

Alkebulan an African dining hall with nine kitchens serving different kinds of African cuisines is run by a Kenyan Cyprian Machangoh who is the head chef.

What hit me first was the shisha menu at the entrance. They have different types and flavours ranging from Sh2260 (70 dirhams) to Sh3229 (100 dirhams).

But I was not there for shisha mine was to quell a craving for real African food. A satisfying meal.

We started with oxtail fried rice as a starter. The oxtail meat was tender and the dish was a fusion of African-Asian cooking where the African ingredients are combined with Asian flavours.

“The meat is highly praised in African households and is usually cooked for lactating mothers and elderly people because of its tenderness. We braise it for around six hours then pull it from the bones” said Chef Machangoh.

The rice was black from Egypt mixed with Basmati rice and added Kenyan ingredients like black-eyed peas (njahi). It was then infused with Asian white soy—shoyu sesame oil and spring onions and bean sprouts.

For finishing the chef added chilli and curry powder giving it a spicy taste and strength of African ingredients.

My main dish was octopus choma served with cassava made with coconut. The dish is from the Kenyan coast where they use a lot of coconut in their dishes the chef said

Being fresh from the ocean the octopus is cooked with spices like cloves and a bit of pineapple and oranges to soften it and bring out a creative favour.

After braising for around three hours until it is tender it is cooked on a grill.

“We sweet the cassava with onions boil it and intensify the flavour with cloves cardamom and coconut cream to have it savoury and become a bed for the octopus” said the chef.

The flavour of the coconut combines very well with the taste of the seafood. My colleagues had beef ribs served with ugali.

Alkebulan whose name means mother of mankind or garden of Eden has nine restaurants with cuisines from every part of Africa. It also includes the diversity of cultures within the continent like Arabic French and western.

“All nine restaurants are a representation of Africa. We have one restaurant that has African street food like mutura samosa tamiya from Egypt manisha from South Africa and Kampala’s rolex which is eggs wrapped in chapati” said the chef who clocks almost 20 years in professional kitchens.

He has worked with Celebrity Cruises under Royal Caribbean Group the popular TV cooking series — MasterChef and an Asian French fusion restaurant in Downtown Dubai.

Getting ingredients

The ingredients are sourced from all over the world including Kenya Ghana Egypt Cameroon South Africa and Oman.

“We sometimes have supply delays on deliveries when the country goes out of stock. But we ensure we have a rotating menu for instance goat from Kenya to substitute fish from Ethiopia” the chef adds.

The prices range from Sh1500 (50 AED) to Sh3090 (100 AED) however some side dishes like roasted plantains or sweet potatoes fries would cost 30 AED (Sh900) while Nairobi samosa goes for 35 AED (Sh1050).

The ugali fries served with goat ribs meal is 82AED (Sh2460).

Shisha is available at the lounge as it is a culture for diners in Arab countries to enjoy it at restaurants.

“As a chef in a foreign country you have to understand business trends and what will move volumes. Most people here smoke shisha so it gives them a chance to try our food. And no the shisha is not African. It’s just an addition to the menu” Chef Machangoh says.

The restaurant’s interior is designed with the African culture in mind. It has bits of makuti even as it retains modern concept.

“The restaurants attract foreigners most because they find the cuisine unique. Africans grew up with this kind of culture and food” said Chef Machangoh who started his cooking career when he joined the military at Kenya Airforce in 2003.",,,,,,

But when ""roast master"" Jeff Ross said a joke about New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft Brady seemed quick to shut it down.

During Ross’s joke presentation he mentioned Brady being taken 199th overall in the NFL Draft and he said he walked into Kraft’s office to tell him something.

""’Would you like a massage?’"" he said.

PATRIOTS' JEROD MAYO DOUBTS TOM BRADY WANTS TO PLAY QUARTERBACK FOR HIS OLD TEAM

WARNING: VIDEO BELOW CONTAINS EXPLICIT LANGUAGE

The Los Angeles Forum was a mixture of laughs and groans as Ross poked fun at a serious charge that Kraft had faced in early 2019.

In February 2019 Kraft was charged in a multicounty investigation of massage parlors that included a secret video recording in the spas’ lobbies and rooms. Police said the recordings showed Kraft and other men engaging in sex acts with women and paying them.

Kraft would plead not guilty to the charge issued a public apology in March 2019 and would be cleared of a soliciting sex charge in 2020.

Brady turned toward Ross once the joke was said and as Ross looked over at Kraft in the crowd Brady came into frame and tried to whisper something to Ross. But it was caught by a microphone.

""Don’t say that s--- again"" he said quickly to Ross who acknowledged it with a laugh.

“I made a boo-boo” Jeffrey S. McConney admitted when describing the erroneous math he scribbled on “TRUMP” corporate letterhead.

The former Trump Organization controller testified about the notes he took during a January 2017 meeting that laid out how the family real estate company was going to surreptitiously reimburse attorney Michael Cohen for fronting the $130000 that silenced the porn star Stormy Daniels. That payment kept her from going public about her decade-old one-night stand with Trump in the days before the 2016 presidential election.

The farce was laid out in black and white with handwritten notes explaining the fuzzy math at play.

Cohen would be paid $180000 which was doubled on paper so that it would make up for the roughly 50 percent taxes the Midtown Manhattan resident would have to pay in federal state and city taxes. McConney wrote “180000 x 2 for taxes” in black pen on the bright white paper. On the witness stand he admitted the company was fine having it “grossed up” to ensure Cohen got his proper share.

The sham continued when tallying up Cohen’s bonus. Initially $50000 was marked as “paid to Red Finch for tech services” but that seemed to morph instead to mean $60000 for Cohen himself.

“Michael was complaining that his bonus wasn’t large enough. This was to make up for whatever he thought he was owed” McConney testified.

The total $420000 was then divided by 12 so that Cohen would get $35000 each month for a year. McConney’s notes of that meeting included a mention that stated “Mike to invoice us” the genesis of what prosecutors say would later be Cohen invoices for fake legal work that Trump gladly paid to keep the hush money deal under wraps.

Monday’s testimony also connected Trump directly to the process a major step forward in the case. Prosecutors showed jurors a copy of a March 28 2017 email in which McConney wrote “I’ll check status tomorrow. DJT needs to sign check.”

On the stand McConney explained that authorizing the money transfers would require having someone actually go to the White House have the then-president of the United States approve the payment himself—while he was president.

But in an instance that exemplifies the lack of intellectual rigor involved in this operation at least one of those checks disappeared on its way back north from Washington to New York City.

After three monthly payments to Cohen in January February and March McConney asked an employee in the Trump Organization accounting department Deborah Tarasoff to cancel a check cut in April that didn’t return.

“It looks like we never got a check back from the White House. It got lost somebody couldn’t find it. I guess it’s the same as lost” he testified.

Paperwork showed that after $105000 was paid by The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust the bean counters back in Manhattan realized it would be easier to run the next $315000 in payments through Trump’s personal accounts for the rest of the year.

Matt Colangelo a prosecutor with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office meticulously went through each of Cohen’s 12 invoices. Every month in 2017 Cohen would email Allen Weisselberg a disgraced accountant who was then the Trump Organization’s chief financial officer but has since been convicted of tax fraud and spent three months at New York’s dreaded Rikers Island jail. Cohen would deliver a curt greeting—mentioning some summer fun a hurricane hitting Weisselberg’s Florida home Thanksgiving the winter holidays—then get right down to business.

“Pursuant to the retainer agreement kindly remit payment for services rendered” Cohen would email Weisselberg each time proudly signing his emails: “Michael D. Cohen Esq. Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump.”

One by one Colangelo went over every monthly email attached invoice forwarded Weisselberg email and McConney’s copy over to Tarasoff. By the time they got to September McConney was starting to wear down.

“$35000” he said sounding increasingly tired of answering why he knew how much to pay despite there not being any dollar figure on the invoice for supposed legal work. The answer was always the same: that first meeting in January 2017.

“It’s an invoice from Michael Cohen” he groaned when discussing the October paperwork.

When Colangelo asked him to read the email McConney let out a mild whine. “The whole thing?” he asked.

“Why don’t we just do the body this time” Colangelo acquiesced.

The internal Trump corporate emails showed how invoices made their way from Cohen to Weisselberg to McConney to Tarasoff. And the chain would generally end the same way.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMDYvYXJ0cy9kZXNpZ24vaGFtbWVyLW11c2V1bS1hbm4tcGhpbGJpbi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Who's Who of L.A.'s Art World Bids Farewell to a Champion,"The actor Owen Wilson chatted with the artist Ed Ruscha.

Peyton Woodyard a four-star safety who committed to Alabama as part of its 2024 recruiting class in December and enrolled in the school for the spring semester entered the transfer portal in late April. He committed to the Ducks on Sunday. Woodyard is the second win for the Ducks this weekend as Michigan State transfer defensive tackle Derrick Harmon committed to the Ducks on Friday.

247Sports' recruiting analyst Greg Biggins describes Woodyard as ""a smart heady safety with an extremely high football IQ.""

Woodyard and Harmon are two massive additions for Oregon which now ranks second in the 247Sports transfer portal team rankings trailing only Ole Miss. The Ducks have added 14 players via the portal this offseason as they prepare for their first season in the Big Ten.

The biggest additions have been quarterback Dillon Gabriel from Oklahoma former five-star receiver Evan Stewart from Texas A&M and cornerback Jabbar Muhammad who helped rival Washington win the Pac-12 and reach the College Football Playoff title game last year. Then there's former five-star quarterback Dante Moore who comes to Oregon from UCLA. The Ducks are not just landing talent in the portal but plucking players from other top programs.

Ohio State is the favorite to win the Big Ten this season but even with Michigan coming off a national title many view the Ducks as the biggest threat to the Buckeyes in 2024. It would be a remarkable story for the Ducks to compete for a conference title in their first year in the league. It would certainly buck the trend of what normally happens when new schools enter one of the Power Four leagues but with the way Oregon has recruited at both the high school level as well as in the portal there may not be a team that's ever been in such a strong position to do so.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9zZi9hcnRpY2xlL3MtZi12YWxlbmNpYS1zdHJlZXQtYmljeWNsZS1sYW5lLTE5NDQyMjcyLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,S.F.'s Valencia Street merchants endorse replacing center bikeway with protected side-running lanes,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/s-f-valencia-street-bicycle-lane-19442272.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9zZi9hcnRpY2xlL3MtZi12YWxlbmNpYS1zdHJlZXQtYmljeWNsZS1sYW5lLTE5NDQyMjcyLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The buyer is a Colorado investment group affiliated with Marcel Arsenault the founder of Real Capital Solutions.

The low-slung Schlumberger building built in the 1970s sits on a 29-acre tract on the southwest corner of Richmond Avenue and Briarpark Drive.

The property 10001 Richmond Avenue is just east of the Sam Houston Tollway and north of the Westpark Tollway. Schlumberger which has 10 more years left on the lease has been the sole tenant for several years.

The seller of the buildings was New York-based Lexington Industrial Trust a publicly traded REIT formerly known as Lexington Realty Trust.

Lexington has been becoming more focused on industrial property and this transaction appears to be consistent with that mission with the reduction of office properties in its portfolio.

Lexington’s Houston Industrial Purchase in 2021

Last summer Lexington added to its Houston portfolio with the acquisition of a newly constructed fully leased three-building Class A industrial portfolio totaling 738701 SF near the Port of Houston in Pasadena and Deer Park. The seller was Triten Real Estate Partners . The 44.6-acre portfolio comprises Bayport North Logistics Center I (9701 New Decade) and Bayport North Logistics Center II (4100 Malone) in Pasadena and Underwood Port Logistics Center (4660 Underwood) in Deer Park all within Houston’s Southeast Industrial submarket near the Port of Houston.

Activist Investor Jonathan Litt Eyes Lexington

Meanwhile Lexington Industrial Trust itself may be acquired soon. Activist investor Jonathan Litt of Land & Buildings Investment Management has sent a letter to Lexington’s board indicating that Litt may be making an approach. The deal would be a $4 billion transaction maybe more. Litt who demanded a seat on Lexington’s board has an appetite for warehouses and Lexington has a 56 million SF industrial portfolio.

Father son lots of sparkle.

Lady Gaga hit the SAG Awards 2022 red carpet Sunday night in a white-hot Armani Privé gown with a folded bust showing off a plunging sweetheart neckline adorned with gold sparkles.

She accentuated the look with the gorgeous Tiffany & Co. Schlumberger Flowers and Leaves necklace in 18-karat yellow gold and platinum with diamonds from the 2022 Tiffany Blue Book Collection.

Her other jewelry included an 8-carat diamond ring and diamond drop earrings both also from Tiffany.

Gaga finished her look with bold white eyeshadow and channeled Old Hollywood glamour with soft blond waves.

The actress 35 is nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role for her performance as Patrizia Reggiani in “House of Gucci.” She’ll face off against Jessica Chastain Olivia Colman Jennifer Hudson and Nicole Kidman in the category.

“House of Gucci” is also nominated for Best Ensemble Cast while co-star Jared Leto is up for Best Supporting Actor.

“I think that women’s stories are beautiful and they’re complicated and complex” she told E!’s red carpet host Laverne Cox of the role.

Gaga has talked at length about the emotionally draining process of playing the murderous wife of Italian fashion mogul Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver) revealing that she needed an on-set psychiatric nurse during the end of filming.

“I don’t think that any actor should push themselves to that limit” she said in December.

“And I ask myself all the time why I do that. I’ve done some pretty extreme art pieces throughout my career — the things I’ve put my body through my mind. It’s like a walnut of sadness in my stomach as I say this to you. I don’t know why I’m like that.”",,,,,,,,,

Unless that rose is called millennial pink. Since the not-quite-bubblegum not-quite-salmon shade was officially coined as such in Véronique Hyland’s 2016 essay it’s gone from the hue you rosé-d all day with (while passing rosy-hued ads and debating which peachy-pink velvet sofa would best complement the neon sign you’d hang above it) to a basic—ahem cheugy—shade everyone’s all too quick to declare passé. (Indeed one of the top related questions people Google when searching millennial pink is asking whether it’s over—and what the new “it” color is.)

As quick as we are to announce that we’re on to new shades—virtually every major paint company on the planet relishes in declaring a new color of the year—the shade is far from dead; it’s simply evolving.

“When millennial pink was introduced it wasn’t a new color but it was a great example of how a large-scale trend blossoms over time” says Sue Wadden director of color marketing at Sherwin-Williams.",,,,,,,,,,,,

According to North Coast locals he is kicking back in a humble fibro shack near Seven Mile Beach and hatching plans to rebuild on the 500 square metre site.

The two-bedroom house was put up for auction late last year with a $2 million reserve by Elders’ Jason Crethar. It was sold after half a dozen buyers competed over 45 minutes with the property snapped up by a mystery buyer from Sydney who had never seen it for $2.91 million.

The Corben Architects-designed house home of Michael and Helen Carapiet has sold for more than $25 million. The sleepy Middle Harbour suburb – best known as the long-time home of the late Bob Hawke – now takes top honours thanks to an off-market sale of more than $25 million this week of the home of corporate heavyweight Michael Carapiet and his wife Helen. Atlas’ Michael Coombs won’t reveal the price given the ink is still drying on the deal but the exact sale price need not be much more than Mosman’s $25 million top result of 2018 set by Sydney Swans chairman Andrew Pridham.

Not that there’s any shortage of Mosman estates up to the task of recalibrating things in its favour as the likes of Ken Done Ros Oatley and Roy Manassen well know. They just won’t sell the family home to prove it. Link Group chairman Michael Carapiet and his wife Helen are downsizing from Northbridge.

Gamer’s Pyrmont digs Not to make anyone feel too badly about their success – or lack of – in the property market but the “architectural masterpiece” in Pyrmont that hit the market this week for $4.5 million is owned by a 27-year-old university drop-out.

Not that Elliott Watkins hasn’t had some success in his many hours spent playing Fortnite. With 9.46 million subscribers he is ranked among Australia’s top YouTubers to whom he is best known as Muselk. The Pyrmont terrace of Elliott Watkins last traded in 2017 for $3.65 million. Watkins was only 23 and a recent co-founder of gaming talent agency Click Management when he bought the four-bedroom Victorian terrace with a pool for $3.65 million having recently moved from Melbourne. Elliott Watkins’s Muselk has 9.46 million subscribers on YouTube. Since then he has been streaming his live video game commentaries to the many millions from the office space set above the garage at the back of the Pyrmont Street house. It has no doubt made his mother former Coca-Cola Amatil chief Alison Watkins proud and helped fund the $9.125 million Tamarama house he bought from Hollywood cinematographer Peter James in 2020.

Point Piper’s high hopes Five years after Kristy Mirzikinian became an internet sensation thanks to her reaction to a sinkhole that opened up out the front of her Point Piper home she is selling up.

The five-bedroom house with a pool and one of only half a dozen tennis courts in the suburb was purchased new in 2008 for $9.55 million. Southern Highlands price hike Southern Highlands real estate is getting more expensive by the day. A week after it was revealed the Ainsworth pokie machine family had sold Braesyde for more than $20 million comes word that Fonthill in Mittagong has sold for much the same price.

Developer “Fred” Fouad Deiri’s Deicorp Asset Holding has already lodged interest on the home of property investors Michael and Melissa Mahony and settlement will confirm the result given no comment from Drew Lindsay’s Samuel Lindsay. Loading Fonthill is set on 42 hectares purchased by the Mahonys as land in 1998 for $1.2 million on which architect Howard Tanner and TKD Architect’s John Rose designed what is regarded as one of the largest private residences in the district. It was only two years ago that the district record stood at $15 million – set by Mike Cannon-Brookes for 155 hectares in the Point Piper of the Southern Highlands Kangaloon – but that looks almost reasonable this side of the pandemic thanks to Victor Comino’s $48 million purchase of 109 hectares in Burradoo. No wonder local agent Angus Campbell-Jones was hastily shooed away from the Kangaloon home of cattleman Theo Onisforou in 2019 despite bearing an offer of $65 million for his 400 hectare property.

“At the time I thought it was drug money” said Campbell-Jones. The issue wasn’t just that Onisforou’s is the largest farm locally but also that it comes with a 44-room residence and at least a dozen other houses on the property. Onisforou who has expanded his farming empire to Gundagai in recent years says he is not a seller. Kevin Maloney pictured in 2008.

The Vikings needed a guard and the two-time first-team All-American was not only a great fit for their zone blocking scheme he would also bring some much-needed power to their offensive line. There were certainly reasons why Davis fell to the third round but one assumed he'd have a pretty good chance to see the field right away at right guard because of the Vikings' lack of proven options at that position.

Instead he never played a snap on offense. Dakota Dozier and Oli Udoh were clearly ahead of Davis throughout all of training camp with Udoh winning the starting job at RG. When Udoh needed to slide over to left tackle for a few games late in the season with Christian Darrisaw injured it was Mason Cole who filled in at RG. It was clear that the Vikings' coaching staff didn't view Davis as an option for playing time as a rookie.

Will year two be different? With a new coaching staff that includes head coach Kevin O'Connell offensive coordinator Wes Phillips and offensive line coach Chris Kuper maybe it will be. Davis has a clean slate to work with and he's apparently working hard this offseason — including spending over a month in Dallas working with offensive line guru Duke Manyweather — to get ready to compete for a starting spot.

""I wanted to help contribute and I didn’t have the opportunity to do so which is why I’m making sure that doesn’t happen again"" Davis told Chris Tomasson of the Pioneer Press. “I’m just doing everything I can to put me in a position to help my team win. Once that opportunity comes I’m going to take it and never look back. So I’m just trying to do everything in my power right now to put me in a spot to do so.""

They may have said ‘I do’ over a decade ago but love is still in the air for Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen as they celebrated their 13th wedding anniversary this weekend.

The couple who tied the knot in 2009 commemorated the day by penning loving tributes to each other on Instagram. They both shared a black-and-white photo from their wedding day to mark the special day.

‘13 years ago we both said “I do” …and you have been the best thing that ever happened to my life’ the Super Bowl champ wrote in his sweet caption.

Tom 44 continued: ‘I love you more now than I ever could have imagined. You are the best mother and wife and supporter in the world and I am blessed to call you my wife.’

The Brazilian model and entrepreneur also shared the same snap writing: ‘Happy anniversary love of my life! Te amo!’

She previously told Vogue that Tom showcased his romantic side the best when he proposed to her.

‘When he proposed to me he made up this whole story how my apartment was flooding and I ran over there to try to fix the situation’ she said.

‘When I got there the whole apartment had candles and rose petals everywhere.’

‘And then he went down on his knees to propose and I was like “get up” because he’d just had surgery and had three staph infections.’

However it hasn’t been all roses throughout their partnership as Tom previously admitted that his supermodel wife was left unhappy with their marriage due to his career commitments with the New England Patriots prior to his retirement.

After a rocky patch where the couple attended counselling they quickly got back on track (Picture: Rex)

He explained: ‘[Gisele] didn’t feel I was doing my part for the family.

‘She felt like I would play football all season and she would take care of the house and all of a sudden when the season would end I would be like “Great let me get into all my other business activities. Let me get into my football training.”‘

‘And she’s sitting there going “Well when are you going to do things for the house? When are you going to take the kids to school and do that?”

Eventually the couple chose to go to marriage counselling in order to overcome their issues and save their relationship.

The couple share daughter Vivian Lake 9 and son Benjamin Rein 12. Brady is also dad to son John ‘Jack’ Edward 14 whom he shares with ex Bridget Moynahan.

Katie Price’s fans have protested that they former glamour model has “cheated” them out of money after she went topless in new footage on her OnlyFans.

The 43 year old – who signed up to the adult platform last month – left her loyal legion of subscribers feeling disappointed after the reality star vowed to bare all on her social media page.

In her latest post the mum-of-five took her X-rated content to the next level as she ditched her bra for her viewers online.

But despite sharing racy content online many of her supporters were less than impressed as they complained the TV star had failed to deliver on her saucy content with her pay-per-view snaps.

Many subscribers flooded the comments section as they demanded to see more after she reassured fans she is going to bring ""the old Pricey back"" The Mirror reported.

On Friday (25 February) the blonde bombshell teased her fans with an overhead shot before she stripped off.

One disappointed user wrote: “I’m pretty sure it will only be a flash of the boob. And it’ll be ppv (pay per view). We’re being had lads. Given all the ppv I’ve already paid for that was just Instagram stuff and the initial £15 … this is another.”

Another viewer asked: “Are the puppies finally coming out to play?” while a third chimed in with: “Yep is be better if there was a little more on show.”

However other viewers were blown away with the content the doting mum published on the X-rated site as they praised her curvaceous figure online.

One user gushed: “Your body is a work of art” as another fan penned: “Hot hot hot from such a beautiful woman.”

It comes after Katie announced that she would be taking her saucy snaps to the next level as with nude snaps soon to come.

In the clip she said: “My ears have been ringing lately because apparently you want the old Pricey back …

“Well let’s bring it on sunshine! It’s a party with Pricey! So everyone I’ve teased you enough you think that’s tame do you?”

She continued: ""Well it’s time to level to with you guys stay tuned and you’ll see what’s coming. Now this has been the warm up. Now get ready for me to level up!""

“You know what that’s about” before she held up a sign that read “Get naked.”"

The Philadelphia native-born Symere Bysil Woods has had a string of Hip-Hop hits including “Money Longer” and “You Was Right” since he first exploded onto the scene in 2016.

But these days he’s been making a different type of money move.

As AfroTech previously reported Lil Uzi Vert made headlines when he reportedly used the cryptocurrency Ethereum to purchase a car for his longtime girlfriend City Girls superstar JT. And he clearly has the money to plunk down for such an impressive car.

According to Celebrity Net Worth the “emo rapper” — who claims to be a fan of rock acts like Paramore and My Chemical Romance and claims they’ve influenced his rap style — is one of the top-paid rappers in the industry today. Between September 2017 and September 2018 he earned an impressive $20 million and that was based solely on the strength of his album and single sales. On the streaming side Spotify reports that Lil Uzi Vert has nearly 23 million monthly listeners and his “XO Tour Llif3” single has had nearly two billion streams since it hit the controversial streaming platform.

It's soul food and Florida restaurants have some of the best takes on the uniquely southern cuisine.

A traditional meal — whether at a holiday gathering at home or even drive-thru — is colorful flavorful and might include: fried or baked chicken; beef tips; fried or smothered porkchops; collards mustards or turnip greens (usually flavored with smoked meat); field peas such as black-eyed peas; cornbread; yams; oxtails and gravy; rice; and stewed or fried okra.

Grab a few napkins now and later a blanket.

Here are 10 soul food restaurants that deserve a first try — or second helping — while traveling across the state.

Big John’s Eatery

(100 Sansburys Way Suite 100 steps from Dick’s Sporting Goods in The Shoppes at Southern Palms West Palm Beach 561-333-2333 BigJohnsEatery.com)

When crafting the menu at Big John’s Eatery in suburban West Palm Beach John and Sasha LeJeune took inspiration from their own home kitchen where Sasha’s comfort cooking earned a following among friends and family. The menu’s star attraction is her weekend oxtail and grits a hefty bowl that combines creamy white grits and slow-braised oxtail. A touch of oxtail pan gravy and a sprinkling of chopped scallions brings the dish together.

It was that dish that sparked the soul food diner’s present brunch-all-day concept. Customers would come in during the week clamoring for the dish and other Sunday brunch favorites. Open since September 2020 Big John’s Eatery also reflects the flavors of Sasha’s Panamanian roots and John’s Haitian heritage. In vintage South Florida style their soul food carries echoes of the Caribbean.

Farmers Market Restaurant

(2736 Edison Ave. Fort Myers; 239-334-1687; farmersmarketrestaurant.com)

As NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders put it in Time magazine in 2018 this is ""some of the best soul food I’ve ever had. It’s a must every time I go back home."" Fort Myers' oldest restaurant Farmers Market has been crafting slow-braised collard greens meatloaf fried chicken and sweet potato pies for 70 years thanks to cooks and servers who have been there for almost as many decades. Those pies are Christine Yelling's handiwork and sweet potato is just her beginning; pecan apple peanut butter lemon meringue and seasonal berry pies round out her extensive repertoire.

If you're more savory than sweet Mark David Anderson serves as Farmers Market's pit master smoking ribs and juicy shreds of pulled pork laced with charred bits of bark. Many of the restaurant's classic recipes — the ham hocks the smothered chicken the stuffed bell peppers — come from the late Olivia Williams. Miss Libby as her many regulars knew her shaped this kitchen from 1976 until her death in 2019 at the age of 87. But her soul lives on.

Josiah's Southern Cooking

(1003 Martin Luther King Jr Blvd. Panama City)

On any given day you will find Josiah's owner Sharolyn Gaines multi-tasking at her restaurant. But on every day those tasks will include creating her signature dish fried pork chops. It's almost a ritual how she conjures up a closely held secret recipe for the batter with which she then coats the custom-cut chops. After being submerged in oil for the perfect amount of time the meat emerges golden and properly crispy - creating the kind of bite that southern folks take personally.

Gaines pairs her protein with cornbread rice and gravy and a choice of another side. Most popular proteins on Josiah's menu behind porkchops are oxtails then fried fish. Sides often include macaroni and cheese yams corn and collard greens. When asked what makes her food different Gaines said ""I want to serve food the way I grew up — the old-fashioned way. I want to give my customers a touch of being at home.""

LEXINGTON Minnesota — The family of Kailey Mach is mourning the 20-year-old after she died in a house explosion Saturday night in Le Sueur County.

According to Le Sueur County Sheriff Brett Mason a 911 call for a reported house explosion on 211th Avenue in Lexington Township about six miles northeast of Le Center came in around 11:25 p.m. on Feb. 26.

When fire crews and deputies arrived at the residence they found the explosion caused the house to catch on fire and collapse according to the sheriff's office.

As crews began to put out the fire officials say first responders soon learned that the family who lived there was gone but a 20-year-old woman later identified by her family as Mach was staying there to watch the house and the homeowner's two dogs.

Fire crews found Mach's body in the basement of the home after putting out the fire officials say.

Mach's uncle Tim Siebsen told KARE 11 that his niece attended Augsburg University and planned to use her degree to follow her dreams of becoming a kindergarten teacher.

""She worked so hard to be a teacher; she was going to graduate almost a year early"" Siebsen said. ""She was an employee of TCU schools working as a KidZone leader (before and after child care) [and] she also worked as a preschool aid in the district. She was so loved by all of her kiddos. She was so loved by anyone that met her. She did all this while taking more than a full-time class load at Augsburg.""

A spokesperson from Augsburg University told KARE 11 the school was ""deeply saddened"" by Mach's untimely death.

""The Augsburg community is deeply saddened by Kailey’s tragic passing this weekend and we offer our profound condolences to her family friends professors classmates and all who were close to her.""

According to Siebsen Mach was also a very involved with her church youth group in Le Center and was preparing for Bible camp this summer.

""She was such a great person to everyone she met"" he said adding ""She brought so much light and love to our lives.""

The cause of the explosion is still under investigation by the sheriff's office and State Fire Marshal's Office.

LUV,Southwest Airlines,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vYWVyb3hwbG9yZXIuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3NvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy1jb25zaWRlcnMtZGZ3LWZvci1mdXR1cmUtZ3Jvd3RoLnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Airlines Considers DFW for Future Growth,"Low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines has a history of avoiding busier hub airports. Despite this ever since the mid-2000s the carrier has begun adding some of America’s busiest airports to its network. Comments from one of Southwest’s former executives revealed there could be more of these additions in the future more specifically in their hometown of Dallas.

For decades Southwest has shown favor for smaller lower-cost alternatives to major cities in the United States. For example their headquarters borders the property of Dallas’ Love Field Airport (DAL) the gateway often thought of as an alternative for the busier Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). In fact the carrier fought a fierce legal battle for the right to remain at Love Field instead of moving to DFW. Meanwhile other secondary airports like Chicago-Midway and Houston-Hobby have become large and important cities in the carrier’s network.

Despite its ""luv"" for Dallas' Love Field Southwest could potentially expand to DFW in the future. Photo: Edwin Sims

With the exception of Los Angeles throughout the 1980s and 1990s Southwest remained dedicated to almost exclusively serving secondary airports. However things changed in 2004 when Southwest challenged US Airways by launching flights to Philadelphia International Airport (PHL). In the following years more major hubs like Denver (DEN) Boston (BOS) and San Francisco (SFO) were added. Additionally throughout the pandemic Southwest doubled down on its expansion in major hubs with the launch of service to Miami (MIA) Chicago O’Hare (ORD) and Houston-Intercontinental (IAH).

Missing from the list of newly added hubs however is Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Despite this Southwest is considering the gateway for future growth within the next decade. Former CEO Gary Kelly explained that it made little sense for the carrier to serve the Dallas area for such a long time without growing in the Texas city. Though perhaps unexpected the case for service to DFW has some strong points. For example in a compromise to end the Wright Amendment it was agreed that the airport was not allowed to add any additional gates (making the maximum number of gates the airport is allowed to 20). On top of this Love Field is not allowed to handle any international flights. If Southwest wanted to add more flights from north Texas (especially international routes) then DFW might be its best way.

A move to DFW does have its drawbacks. The airport is a massive hub for American Airlines which would undoubtedly defend its turf against any new carriers. To make things more difficult DFW is a very large and oftentimes congested airport meaning keeping planes productive like Southwest and other low-cost carriers do would be another challenge. Southwest will have to consider the strengths and weaknesses of this strategy in the coming years to determine if it will help its presence in Dallas. Regardless of the outcome one thing is certain: long gone are the days that Southwest avoids major hubs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyL2ZlYi8yNy9ub3J0aHdlc3QtYXJrYW5zYXMtbmF0aW9uYWwtYWlycG9ydC1vZmZpY2lhbHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Northwest Arkansas National Airport officials hopeful about future at XNA,"HIGHFILL -- Northwest Arkansas National Airport officials are feeling pretty optimistic with a wad of cash in pocket federal infrastructure money on the horizon and covid seemingly waning.

Airport officials were told recently they have $30 million in cash available for projects. They're still waiting to see how much federal infrastructure money and grant opportunities will actually be available. Estimates are the airport will recover to 2019 enplanement numbers by 2024 if not sooner.

The airport has 27 direct destinations now and expects others including daily flights to Los Angeles to return in the not too distant future. Four seasonal routes including Orlando Fla. are also expected to return for vacation season. San Francisco is dependent on international travel returning.

Two airlines Spirit and Frontier are seeking to merge and Frontier is leaving Tulsa Okla. next month which could help XNA attract more Frontier customers from eastern Oklahoma officials said. Frontier is focused on the western U.S. while Spirit focuses on the east.

""We are optimistic that it's not going to be bad for us"" said Aaron Burkes CEO. ""It actually has the potential if anything to be good for us. But again it's too early to really know this merger will still have to go through regulatory approval.""

Burkes said the airport is also attracting more people from downstate who drive up for direct flights they can't get out of Little Rock. Burkes cited a family from Little Rock who drove up for a direct flight to Los Angeles and a person from Russellville who drove up to fly to New York because Little Rock doesn't have direct flights to either destination.

Frances Mayo owner of Around the World Travel in Springdale said her bookings for leisure travel were increasing in the fall before the omicron variant of covid-19 hit. There were cancellations and bookings dropped significantly in December and into mid-January she said.

""Since then my numbers are back up and looking strong for spring and summer travel"" Mayo said.

Business travel which was XNA's bread and butter before the pandemic appears to be coming back. But the long-term impact of online meeting technology use is still unknown.

""We do see business travel coming back and the airlines themselves are predicting business travel is going to come back"" Burkes said. ""It looks already like maybe 60-70% according to some of the estimates. For us locally we think it's going to be coming back with a vengeance starting in March.""

According to the 2022 Deloitte Travel Outlook corporate travel demand nationally should improve significantly when workers return to offices in greater numbers enabling more client visits. That development appears likely during the first half of 2022 according to Deloitte which provides analytics to airlines and the transportation industry among other services. Even assuming the best possible covid-19 outcomes corporate travel in 2022 is unlikely to reach or even approach 2019 levels according to Deloitte.

Even then not everyone will be eager to return to their prepandemic frequency. Not all clients will immediately welcome the same volume of visitors they did in 2019 according to Deloitte. At the same time business executives likely will continue to closely scrutinize travel spending and return on investment after operating successfully with so few trips during the pandemic.

Mike Lum of Volaire Aviation a consulting firm that tracks the airline industry and advises XNA officials said the airport should be well-positioned over the next several months for its passenger traffic to rebound. The additional destinations added by Allegiant Breeze and Frontier have already helped leisure traffic rebound relatively quickly at the airport.

""The next step will be the recovery in domestic business travel and all indications are business travel will be back with a vengeance as companies return to face-to-face meetings and attend conferences"" Lum said. ""The final steps in the recovery will be in international leisure and business travel. The international leisure travel recovery should occur this summer as European destinations lift travel restrictions. International business travel will likely recover once some of the testing and quarantine restrictions particularly in Asia are lifted.""

Lum is recommending anyone planning to travel between now and May should book early.

""Demand is going to be robust and flights are going to sell out"" he said. ""Keep in mind most airlines have eliminated change fees so there is no penalty if travel plans change.""

Business travel historically made up 12%-30% of all airline travel nationally. For XNA it was 60%. The airport makes more money off business travelers because they're more likely to park rent cars and spend on concessions.

Southwest Airlines said it's back to 70% of prepandemic business travel levels and United Airlines reported a 60% return. Southwest predicted a return to 80%-90% of 2019 levels by the end of 2022.

Andrew Branch the airport's chief business development officer said airlines were adamant in recent meetings they need business travel to return to maintain routes.

""Just prior to the conference so two or three weeks ago they started seeing a large uptick in bookings over the next few months and they attributed that to increased business travel"" Branch said.

Companies nationwide are returning to the office and allowing travel officials said.

Walmart is expected to start bringing employees back to the home office Monday which could stimulate travel both into and out of Northwest Arkansas officials said. Walmart has also booked several charters in the coming weeks and months.

""If this trend kind of continues of them freeing up and allowing more travel you've got all these vendors and people who work with Walmart and others that haven't really gotten to come meet in a couple of years. We think it could kind of open the flood gates"" Branch said. ""That's the hope.""

Some travel sites such as Expedia are reporting bookings actually exceeding 2019 levels Burkes said.

Potential headwinds for airlines include higher costs for labor and fuel which could drive up ticket prices Burkes said.

The airport has also seen an increase in leisure travel during the pandemic attributed largely to landing several low-cost carriers. Low-cost carriers are adding market share as well capturing around 20% of passengers at XNA. Allegiant has the most at 12%.

""I don't think it's coming at the expense of the legacy carriers"" Burkes said. ""It's truly capturing a different market one that we have not been getting before.""

Legacy carriers still dominate. American Airlines maintains 49% of the traveling public at XNA. United has a 17% share and Delta 15%.

The airport finished 2021 down 32.6% from 2019 passengers numbers. That was actually an improvement from 2020 when passengers were down 61%.

The last three months of 2021 saw XNA passenger numbers recover enough to be down less than 15% compared to 2019. The four-week moving average at the Transportation Services Administration checkpoint is also starting to trend upward.

XNA and other airports use 2019 as a benchmark because passenger numbers went off a cliff in early 2020 as the pandemic began. XNA had a record year for passengers in 2019 with 922533 people flying that year.

S&P Global Ratings is estimating XNA will recover 85%-90% this year with more than 830000 enplanements 95%-100% in 2023 and be back to 100% of 2019 numbers in 2024. Officials budgeted for 750000 this year.

Airport officials also budgeted conservatively during the pandemic so the airport seeing better financial numbers than expected.

The 2021 budget was based on an estimated 350000 passengers but actual numbers were double that estimate at 621942. Operating revenues were 40% higher than expected. Several new airlines were added and car rental companies retained their rental space.

XNA got a new business on the airfield earlier this month. King Aerospace announced they are locating a facility in two hangars at the airport to do maintenance customization upgrades and refurbishment of aircraft. The hangars had been vacant for almost 20 years.

Airport officials hope landing King Aero serves as a catalyst for aeronautical manufacturing growth and that it stimulates other revenue-generating ground lease opportunities and brings new high-paying jobs to the region.

What is known about federal infrastructure is there will be about $25 billion for airports and $15 billion of that will be distributed based on enplanements.

""We know that our number is $4.4 million per year roughly so that's about $22 million over five years"" Burkes said. There is about $5 billion available in discretionary money over the next five years the airport can seek for projects like the combined skybridge and arrivals lobby expansion a $45 million project. The feds could pay for up to 95%.

""We think we've probably got a pretty competitive project"" Burkes said. ""It's shovel ready which is one of the factors that they consider. We're obviously going to get an application in for the skybridge project and fingers crossed we can get some funding.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0ZWFtYm9hdHBpbG90LmNvbS9uZXdzL3JlY29yZC10cmFmZmljLWhhcy15YW1wYS12YWxsZXktcmVnaW9uYWwtYWlycG9ydC1leWVpbmctYW5vdGhlci1leHBhbnNpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Record traffic has Yampa Valley Regional Airport eyeing another expansion,"Heat rises off the runway as a United Airlines flight lands at the Yampa Valley Regional Airport on Friday Feb. 25 2022. The airport is seeing record traffic this winter which has officials looking at what demand might be in the not too distant future. John F. Russell/Steamboat Pilot & Today

Last Saturday Feb. 19 was the busiest day ever at the Yampa Valley Regional Airport with about 4850 people getting on or off a plane.

That record isn’t expected to last long.

“We have over 2500 departing (on Saturday Feb. 26) so typically it’s about the same number that come in so that would put us over 5000” said Kevin Booth airport director. “Since I’ve been here we’ve never come close to that.”

Busy used to mean 3000 people passing through the airport in a day. Now having more than 4000 — and occasionally close to 5000 — is increasingly common during the winter flying season which runs December to April.

On these days Booth recommends arriving at the eight-gate airport about two to three hours before the scheduled takeoff.

In 2021 153440 passengers used the Yampa Valley Regional Airport — the most ever and a 42% increase from 2019 the year Booth compares to because 2020 was such an unusual time for air travel.

The record number of passengers comes on the heels of a $5.2 million terminal renovation that was finished in December 2020 — a project with the main purpose of accommodating the addition of Southwest Airlines at the airport.

Just over a year later Booth is already talking about expanding it again.

“It’s time to really take a hard look at what’s the smartest way to expand the terminal” he said.

The recent expansion added just one gate and one ticketing area for one airline Booth said. The last major expansion at the airport was in 2012. Booth said they have applied for some planning grants the bulk of which would go toward creating a terminal area plan.

This plan would try to project future demand for the airport and what needs it may have in a decade. Booth said adding gates to the terminal — likely to the east — isn’t the only consideration.

Adding more restaurant and retail space parking baggage capacity and security checkpoints among other things are all being looked at.

“If we’re projecting 180000 enplanements in 2022 what are we going to look at in 2032?” Booth asked. “Whatever we build between now and then should have an eye toward 10 15 20 years (from now).”

The plan would be developed over the next two years with construction likely needing to wait until 2024 Booth said.

The pandemic has been a major factor in the record numbers of passengers as mountain destinations with access to nature have been popular destinations for a COVID-fatigued public.

Booth said he still anticipates there to be growth but probably not at the pace of the last two years. The terminal plan would try to forecast those numbers and plan for that growth accordingly.

The 2020 terminal project added a gate at the Yampa Valley Regional Airport that is used by Southwest Airlines. Just over a year later Airport Director Kevin Booth is talking about another expansion. Dylan Anderson/Steamboat Pilot & Today

Another area of growth has been with off-season flights in the spring summer and fall.

Janet Fischer director of the airline program for Steamboat Resort said during a meeting of the Local Marketing District on Friday Feb. 25 that United Airlines would fly three daily flights to Denver International Airport in the off-season. Southwest also will operate five days a week to start but then bulk up to two daily flights to Denver for the core of the summer Fischer said.

“That’s going to allow for better availability and better connectivity both directions” Fischer said.

With the increase in flights over the summer months the airport hopes to lower fares which Booth said makes the airport more accessible for locals.

One indicator of more locals using the airport might be found in the paid parking receipts which Booth said are up 81% since 2019.

However surveys show the breakdown of passengers using the airport has remained relatively similar to what they have traditionally been Fischer said.

About 90% are visitors 6% are locals and 4% are part-time residents or second homeowners.

“There is a lot more local usage of the airport from Routt and Moffat County locals” Fischer said. “The percentages are staying the same because we have a lot more guests also.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9zb3V0aHdlc3QtYm9laW5nLTczNy1kb3VibGUtZW5naW5lLWRhbWFnZS1iaXJkLXN0cmlrZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Boeing 737 Suffers Double Engine Damage After Bird Strike,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9zb3V0aHdlc3QtYm9laW5nLTczNy1kb3VibGUtZW5naW5lLWRhbWFnZS1iaXJkLXN0cmlrZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGUvQ09WSUQtbWFkZS1mbHlpbmctZXZlbi1tb3JlLW1pc2VyYWJsZS1JdC0xNjk0OTA0Ni5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COVID made flying even more miserable.

Stanley Black & Decker (SWK 1.41%) a leader in tools and storage solutions released its first-quarter earnings on May 2 showcasing resilience amid economic fluctuations. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.56 slightly above the expected $0.55. Despite a 1.5% drop in revenue from the previous year total revenue of $3.87 billion was likewise better than the consensus forecast for $3.83 billion.

Metric Q1 2024 Q1 2024 Analysts Estimate Q1 2023 % Change Adjusted EPS $0.56 $0.55 ($0.41) N/A Revenue $3.87 billion $3.83 billion $3.93 billion (1.5%) Gross margin 28.6% N/A 21.2% 7.4 percentage points

The core of the operation

Stanley Black & Decker has cemented its place as a cornerstone in the tools and outdoor equipment industry. With renowned brands like DeWalt and Craftsman as well as its namesake marques the company thrives on innovation quality and operational excellence. Its focus has sharply turned toward optimizing supply chains reducing costs and innovating on the product front as key strategies for sustainable growth.

In the earnings release the company described consumer demand for its products in Q1 as ""muted"" and noted that volumes also fell on the infrastructure side of the business.

However the company's adept maneuvering through cost-reduction initiatives and strategic portfolio adjustments speaks to its resilience. That cost-cutting program which saved it $145 million in the quarter is expected to yield $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2024 and $2 billion by the end of 2025.

Quarterly highlights

Despite a sales dip in its tools and outdoor segment brand strength in DeWalt partially offset sluggish demand. The smaller industrial segment faced steeper sales declines with volumes falling even as it raised prices. Meanwhile gross margin improved thanks to reduced shipping costs and inventory destocking efforts.

Looking ahead

Management's reiteration of its 2024 guidance implies confidence in the company's strategic direction with expectations of sustained operational and margin improvements. Adjusted EPS is forecast to land between $3.50 and $4.50 with free cash flow of $600 million to $800 million.

Investors are encouraged to monitor the company's progress in its global cost reduction program and its investments in innovation and growth initiatives. These areas crucial for long-term value creation embody Stanley Black & Decker's strategic pillars for navigating future market dynamics.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9kZWNvZGluZy1zdGFubGV5LWJsYWNrLWRlY2tlci1pbmMtMDUxNDExOTgyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight,"Comprehensive SWOT analysis based on Stanley Black & Decker Inc's latest SEC 10-Q filing.

Detailed financial overview and strategic insights into the company's operations and market positioning.

Expert assessment of potential challenges and growth prospects for Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

On May 2 2024 Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) filed its 10-Q report with the SEC providing a snapshot of the company's financial health and strategic direction. As a leading manufacturer of hand and power tools SWK operates primarily in two segments: Tools and Outdoor and Industrial. The company has shown resilience in a competitive market with a strong brand portfolio that includes DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. The financial overview from the filing reveals a year-to-date cost of sales totaling $2761.0 million a decrease from the previous year's $3096.3 million indicating improved cost management. Interest expenses have slightly increased to $131.5 million from $130.9 million. The company has also reported a net gain on cash flow hedges albeit minimal and continues to manage its defined benefit pension items with a net of tax amortization of $(2.1) million. These figures set the stage for a deeper dive into SWK's SWOT analysis providing investors with a clearer picture of the company's internal dynamics and external environment.

Decoding Stanley Black & Decker Inc (SWK): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Brand Power: Stanley Black & Decker Inc's brand strength is a significant asset. The company's portfolio includes some of the most recognized names in the tool industry such as DEWALT CRAFTSMAN and BLACK+DECKER. These brands are synonymous with quality and reliability which has helped SWK maintain a loyal customer base and command premium pricing. The brand power is further evidenced by the company's ability to sustain revenue generation with the Tools & Outdoor segment contributing the lion's share of total revenues amounting to $13.4 billion in 2023.

Operational Efficiency: SWK's commitment to operational excellence is evident in its supply chain transformation initiatives. The company has generated approximately $145 million in pre-tax run-rate savings during the first three months of 2024 driven by lower headcount indirect spend reductions and supply chain efficiencies. This focus on cost control and operational streamlining positions SWK to improve its gross margins and enhance profitability in the long term.

Weaknesses

Market Demand Sensitivity: The company's performance is closely tied to market demand which can be volatile. In the first quarter of 2024 SWK experienced a 1% decline in volume in the Tools & Outdoor segment attributed to a muted market demand backdrop. This sensitivity to economic cycles and consumer spending patterns can lead to fluctuations in revenue and profitability making it challenging to maintain consistent growth.

Story continues

Legal and Compliance Risks: Stanley Black & Decker Inc faces ongoing legal and compliance risks as highlighted by the potential $32 million civil penalty for alleged untimely reporting related to product recalls. Additionally the company is cooperating with investigations into transactions that may raise compliance questions under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These issues not only pose financial risks but can also impact the company's reputation and investor confidence.

Opportunities

Innovation and Product Development: SWK plans to invest between $300 million to $500 million in innovation and commercial investments through 2025 to accelerate organic growth. This strategic focus on innovation presents an opportunity to develop new products and technologies that can meet evolving customer needs and expand market share particularly in high-growth areas such as cordless and smart tools.

Geographic Expansion: With a majority of revenue derived from the United States SWK has significant opportunities to expand its international presence. The company's established brands provide a strong foundation to grow in emerging markets where demand for quality tools and outdoor equipment is increasing. Strategic partnerships and acquisitions could further facilitate international expansion and diversification of revenue streams.

Threats

Competitive Pressure: The tool industry is highly competitive with numerous players vying for market share. SWK must continuously innovate and differentiate its products to stay ahead of competitors. Price competition particularly from lower-cost manufacturers can erode margins and market position if not effectively managed.

Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chain challenges including material shortages and transportation bottlenecks pose a threat to SWK's ability to meet customer demand and maintain operational efficiency. While the company is undertaking a supply chain transformation it remains vulnerable to external disruptions that could impact production and delivery timelines.

In conclusion Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE:SWK) demonstrates strong brand equity and operational efficiency as key strengths while facing challenges related to market demand sensitivity and legal risks. Opportunities for growth through innovation and geographic expansion are promising but the company must navigate competitive pressures and supply chain vulnerabilities. As SWK continues its strategic focus on cost reduction and product development it is well-positioned to leverage its strengths and capitalize on market opportunities despite the potential threats in its operating environment.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Organic revenue or organic sales is defined as the difference between total current and prior year sales less the impact of companies acquired and divested in the past twelve months and any foreign currency impacts. Organic revenue growth organic sales growth or organic growth is organic revenue or organic sales divided by prior year sales. Gross profit is defined as sales less cost of sales. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of sales. Segment profit is defined as sales less cost of sales and selling general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses (aside from corporate overhead expense). Segment margin is segment profit as a percentage of sales. EBITDA is earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is EBITDA as a percentage of sales. Gross profit gross margin SG&A segment profit segment margin EBITDA and EBITDA margin are adjusted for certain gains and charges such as supply chain transformation costs acquisition and divestiture-related items asset impairments restructuring and other adjusting items. Management uses these metrics as key measures to assess the performance of the Company as a whole as well as the related measures at the segment level. Adjusted earnings per share or adjusted EPS is diluted GAAP EPS excluding certain gains and charges. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service other borrowing activity discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions among other items. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The Non-GAAP statement of operations and business segment information is reconciled to GAAP on pages 12 through 14 and in the appendix to the earnings conference call slides available at http://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/investors. The Company considers the use of the Non-GAAP financial measures above relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company's results business trends and outlook measures aside from the material impact of certain gains and charges and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.

The Company also provides expectations for the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EPS presented on a basis excluding certain gains and charges as well as free cash flow. Forecasted adjusted EPS is reconciled to GAAP EPS on page 4. Due to high variability and difficulty in predicting items that impact cash flow from operations a reconciliation of forecasted free cash flow to its most directly comparable GAAP estimate has been omitted. The Company believes such a reconciliation would also imply a degree of precision that is inappropriate for this forward-looking measure.

2 Footprint Rationalization costs in 2024 primarily relate to accelerated depreciation of production equipment of $4.9 million and other

facility exit and re-configuration costs of $10.0 million. In 2023 transfers and closures of targeted manufacturing sites including Fort Worth Texas

and Cheraw South Carolina as previously announced in March 2023 resulted in accelerated depreciation of production equipment of $17.0 million

and non-cash asset write-downs of $42.2 million (predominantly tooling raw materials and WIP).











3 Strategic Sourcing & Operational Excellence costs in 2023 primarily relate to third-party consultant fees to provide expertise in identifying and

quantifying opportunities to source in a more integrated manner and re-design in-plant operations following footprint rationalization developing

a detailed program and related governance and assisting the Company with the implementation of actions necessary to achieve the related objectives.











4 Acquisition & integration-related costs primarily relate to the MTD and Excel acquisitions including costs to integrate the organizations and

shared processes as well as harmonize key IT applications and infrastructure.











5 Includes deal-related costs net of income related to providing transition services to previously divested businesses.











6 The $25.5 million pre-tax asset impairment charge in 2024 related to the Infrastructure business.

Here's why we bought the dip,"Stanley Black & Decker overcame a soft demand environment to deliver a top and bottom line beat Thursday but the stock is falling because the toolmaker simply reiterated its guidance. That's a fate shared by home-improvement peers and many other companies this earnings season. We added to our position on the pullback. Revenue fell 2% year over year in the January-to-March period to $3.87 billion edging out the $3.82 billion expected by analysts according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 56 cents topping the 54-cent estimate LSEG data showed. Stanley Black & Decker Why we own it: Stanley Black & Decker is in the later innings of a multi-year restructuring plan. The company launched a series of initiatives designed to generate cost savings optimize inventory streamline and simplify the organization and transform its supply chain. Although repair and remodeling demand environment is soft due to higher interest rates management's cost-cutting plan will create a stronger company for the next cycle. As we wait for the turnaround to play out we're getting paid a hefty dividend. Competitors: Bosch Techtronic Industries and Illinois Tool Works Most recent buy: May 2 2024 Initiation: June 14 2023 Bottom Line Stanley Black & Decker turned in another solid quarter of execution on matters within management's control. It's making good on its plan of optimizing expensive inventory reducing complexities and improving its supply chain to reach $2 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2025. The progress is evident in the results with adjusted gross margins continuing to improve. The one problem is the broader demand environment is still mostly soft preventing management from raising the midpoint of its outlook. Given the stock's lackluster year-to-date performance we would have thought investor expectations had come down enough to be satisfied with a beat and backing of guidance. However there's always someone with their expectations too high. That's pushing the stock down more than 7%. Stanley Black & Decker's professional customers remain resilient but demand from do-it-yourself customers has not returned to growth. This should be largely understood and we expect to hear similar rhetoric when Home Depot and Lowe's report their earnings later this month. We probably won't see DIY activity meaningfully rebound until mortgage rates come down and reinvigorate the existing home sales market. We focus on existing home sales because the first thing people typically do after buying an older home is spend money on repair and remodeling projects. This dynamic makes Stanley Black & Decker one of the more interest-rate-sensitive stocks we have in the portfolio. We don't want to have too many of them in this ""higher for longer"" environment but at least with Stanley Black & Decker our patience is being rewarded with hefty dividend yield of about 3.80%. The thesis may be taking longer to play out but what management is doing to take out costs in the soft environment will make its earnings power look more impressive once the cycle turns. We are lowering our price target to $105 from $110 because rate cut expectations keep getting pushed out extending the timing of the DIY market recovery. But we are reiterating our 1 rating and bought this pullback earlier Thursday. Quarterly commentary Stanley Black & Decker's largest segment by far — known as Tools & Outdoor — generated sales of $3.29 billion in the quarter topping the $3.27 billion expected by analysts according to FactSet. However operating income of $279 million slightly missed analyst projections of $286 million per FactSet. Volume growth of 1% in the company's flagship DeWalt power tools could not overcome a muted consumer and a soft do-it-yourself environment which pressured sales for hand tools. Outdoor organic revenue was up 2% in the quarter mostly driven by demand for handheld cordless outdoor power equipment. Pricing was flat which we think is a positive because it shows the company isn't cutting prices to spur demand. Once you give up price in this business it's very hard to get it back. Sales in Stanley Black & Decker's smaller Industrial segment— largely made up of fasteners in end markets such as automotive and aerospace — totaled $585 million in the period missing the $596 million estimate according to FactSet. Quarterly operating income in the segment of $71 million topped estimates at $63 million according to FactSet. Organic sales fell 4% partially offset by a 1% price increase across the segment. Within the segment its so-called Engineered Fastening business saw organic revenues grow 5% thanks to a 30% increase in aerospace and a 4% increase in automotive. As a reminder Stanley completed the divestiture of its Infrastructure business on April 1 for $760 million in cash. Net proceeds from the sale were used to reduce short-term debt in the second quarter. The company's adjusted gross margin performance of 29.0% was a solid mark improving 590 basis points compared with last year and exceeding expectations of 28.7%. The result keeps the business on track to achieve its goal of about 30% over the full year. The gross margin improvements were driven by lower inventory destocking costs supply chain transformation benefits and reduced shipping costs. Free cash flow was negative which is typical with first-quarter seasonality. However the result was a little better than expected due to inventory control. The company's capital deployment priorities this year are to invest in organic growth fund the dividend and strengthen the balance sheet. Stanley Black & Decker has been paying a dividend for 147 consecutive years with increases in each of the past 56. Guidance Management made no real changes to its 2024 guidance. It still expects total company organic sales to be relatively unchanged plus or minus low single digits. At the segment level organic sales in Tools & Outdoor are projected to be relatively flat at the midpoint while Industrial is expected to be relatively flat to slightly positive. Margins at Tools & Outdoors are expected to improve year over year while Industrial is expected to remain flat. Management continues to expect adjusted EPS to be between $3.50 to $4.50. Considering the stock sell-off Wall Street must have been looking for some signaling that earnings were trending toward the higher end of the range based on the consensus forecast of $4.14. This was way too optimistic. This modeling came well before the market erased its expectations for multiple interest rate cuts this year. While Stanley's wide earnings range leaves us ambiguity into the rest of the year CFO Patrick Hallinan said he believes the midpoint of the range can be achieved due to costs controls. Meanwhile management reiterated its full-year adjusted free cash flow of $600 million and $800 million. In addition the company expects gross margins to increase sequentially in both halves of 2024 and total 30% for the full year. Gross margins are expected to be in the low 30s exiting the year setting up 2025 for another year of strong year-over-year earnings expansion even if the demand environment stays tepid. The company's long-term adjusted gross margin target of 35% is supported by the $2 billion in annual cost savings it expects by the end of next year. ""We remain confident that our transformation can support the sustainable cost structure and efficiency needed to return our adjusted gross margin to 35% or greater while enabling targeted growth investments"" Hallinan said.

Colin Farrell has attracted plenty of buzz for his upcoming role as The Penguin in Matt Reeves‘ “The Batman” partially due to the prosthetic-induced transformation the actor underwent. Many fans have described Farrell as “unrecognizable” after seeing him in “The Batman” trailers and a new story proves just how true that is.

While filming “The Batman” Farrell had so much confidence in his makeup team that he decided to make a Starbucks run in his full prosthetics. He recounted the story to Collider saying that while he received a few strange looks he does not believe anyone recognized him as a celebrity.

“The first day we tried the whole thing out we took it for a drive a spin metaphorically speaking. We did it in Burbank. It took about six or eight hours. It was a team of ten or fifteen people. And it was really fun. I went into Starbucks and ordered myself a very un-Oswald drink an oat milk latte with two stevia sweeteners. I got a couple of stares but only because it’s such an imposing look” he said.

As comic book movies continue to dominate pop culture and fans become increasingly plugged in to upcoming releases many actors have gone to great lengths to avoid having their presence in big movies leaked. Charlie Cox and Andrew Garfield thrilled fans with their surprise cameos in “Spider-Man: No Way Home” but the surprise was almost spoiled when the two friends went out to lunch in Atlanta while filming the movie.

“While we were sitting down it occurred to both of us ‘Oh shit. If we’re filmed here together that’s not a good sign'” Cox said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. “So we ended up sitting facing the wall both of us.” Fortunately for Colin Farrell it appears his Penguin makeup is so elaborate that he does not have to worry about such things.

“The Batman” opens in theaters this Friday March 4 and an HBO Max spinoff about Farrell’s Penguin is already in development.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8va3Rhci5jb20vc3RvcnkvNDkxNTExNy9mb29kLWNpdHktb3BlbnMtZmlyc3Qtc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWxvY2F0aW9uLWluLWFyaXpvbmEtaW4td2VzdC1waG9lbml4L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Food City opens first Starbucks location in Arizona in west Phoenix,"PHOENIX — Food City on Friday opened its first Starbucks café location in Arizona in the West Valley serving its beverages and pastries in the store with a long-standing reputation of service to the Hispanic community.

The No. 1 request customers presented to the Food City located at 91st Avenue and Thomas Road was a Starbucks café addition Mike Solis director of operations for Food City said in a press release.

“We love being able to make popular requests like this one a reality” Solis said in the release.

Even if you cruise through security with Clear and TSA PreCheck odds are you'll find another stress test if you are in need of a crucial preflight caffeinated beverage.

But coffee lovers may have noticed that there's a new way to jump ahead in at least one other line: Starbucks.

While mobile ordering has been a staple of the Starbucks app for years in many locations airports were notoriously a Starbucks mobile order abyss. Instead of pushing a few buttons to order and then having your venti iced coffee with almond milk waiting as you walked by Starbucks near gate C14 instead you had to just get in line and wait.

The only mobile convenience you would have would be mobile payment with airport Starbucks. (Photo by Katie Falkenberg/For The Times/Getty Images)

Thankfully that's been quietly changing as the coffee giant has been rolling out another variation of its coffee commerce aimed at eliminating all the hassle that stands between you and your favorite beverage.

It's now possible to order ahead and pay using the Starbucks app at many major airport locations across the U.S. And yes that also means you can then easily pay for your in-airport purchase with your Starbucks Stars.

Even though we're just now seeing mobile ordering at select airport locations Starbucks spokesperson Nick Sampogna told TPG the feature ""started rolling out at airports in June 2021... Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD) was the first.""

To find out if your local airport Starbucks is accepting mobile orders just use the store locator in your Starbucks app and see if you could select your desired airport location for a mobile order pick-up.

We recently tested the feature at Orlando International Airport (MCO). TPG staffer and frequent flyer Tarah Chieffi placed her order on the app for two coffees and four breakfast sandwiches at 7:40 a.m. and was given an estimated wait time of 10 minutes. ""The regular line wasn't too long but I was very happy not to be standing in it"" said Tarah thrilled to be testing out the service.

""When I got there my order was already packed up and ready to go. It couldn't have been easier!""

Being able to order your airport coffee in advance to grab on the go with the Starbucks app is reason enough to join the coffee chain's loyalty program to say nothing of the other benefits including free drinks and pastries.

You earn 1 Star per $1 if you decide to pay with cash debit a credit card or a mobile wallet.

Even better you earn 2 Starbucks Stars per $1 spent when you load money to your Starbucks app with your credit card before placing your order. It all starts to become meaningful once you accrue 50 Stars which will score you a free coffee tea or bakery item. There are also frequent bonus promotions available in the app to ramp up your earnings.

Becoming a member is easy. Just set up a profile with your name e-mail address and a password to create a Starbucks Rewards account.

If you're wondering why it took until just recently to order an iced latte when you land and grab it as you deplane the shift became possible when airport concession behemoth HMSHost began leading the charge on mobile ordering at airports. (HMSHost operates food and beverage outlets in more than 120 airports).

As airport concession providers adapt to consumer demands for more efficient and customized experiences travelers can expect to see more changes at their local airport. HMSHost announced in 2020 that it would be terminating its exclusivity agreement with Starbucks after 30 years to focus on local brands and concepts that speak to each destination.

""HMSHost is going to continue to be a partner but they will be in a model where they are not exclusive which gives us a range of options to better serve our customers"" said Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson.

Starbucks' new (nonexclusive) agreement with premier airport concession provider OTG has enabled travelers to place orders at iPad stations and have their food and drinks delivered directly to their gate or wherever they are in the airport.

Bottom line

If you've ever had to skip that much-desired cup of morning coffee on a travel day because the in-airport Starbucks line was too long and you were worried you'd miss your flight this may be the answer to your unspoken prayers. Now before you clear security or taxi to the gate you could place a mobile order for your coffee of choice and if all goes well you can simply skip to the front of the line grab your beverage and be on your way to your final destination.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2phY2trZWxseS8yMDIyLzAyLzI3L2luLXRoZS13b3JrZXItZW1wb3dlcm1lbnQtbW92ZW1lbnQtc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWVtcGxveWVlcy1hcmUtc3RhcnRpbmctdG8tZW1icmFjZS11bmlvbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In The Worker Empowerment Movement Starbucks Employees Are Starting To Embrace Unions,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2022/02/27/in-the-worker-empowerment-movement-starbucks-employees-are-starting-to-embrace-unions/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2phY2trZWxseS8yMDIyLzAyLzI3L2luLXRoZS13b3JrZXItZW1wb3dlcm1lbnQtbW92ZW1lbnQtc3RhcmJ1Y2tzLWVtcGxveWVlcy1hcmUtc3RhcnRpbmctdG8tZW1icmFjZS11bmlvbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpc3RyYWN0aWZ5LmNvbS9wL3N0YXJidWNrcy1uby1pY2UtaGFsZi1mdWxs0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TikToker Asks for No Ice in Starbucks Drink Gets Half a Beverage,"Home > Viral News > Trending TikToker Says Starbucks Barista Filled Cup Halfway After Asking for No Ice in Drink By Mustafa Gatollari Feb. 26 2022 Published 6:20 a.m. ET Source: TikTok | @chronicavida

""The ice is how they get you."" There were a lot of ways everyone was trying to ""get you"" according to my dad. Whether it's eating reheated old fries at a diner or not paying for the insurance from a rental car company when you're traveling on a long road trip you have no intention of subjecting your own vehicle to the unholy amount of miles you're about to put the discount Kia Sephia you rented through.

However he did have a point about to-go beverages at fast food establishments and the amount of ice that's filled to the brim in these things. It almost feels like after just a few gulps your drink's almost done which isn't cool. What's more is that the beverages from the fountain dispensers almost always come out cold anyway so why go through all of the trouble of putting a bunch of ice in it?

You ultimately end up with more of said beverage in your cup when you ask for no ice which is a good thing unless you really want ice. That is unless you've got a Starbucks employee like the one this TikToker encountered who only filled their cup up halfway when they specified that they didn't want any ice in their latte.

A user who posts under the handle @chronicavida says that while frequenting a local Starbucks she regularly visits she ordered a beverage without any ice. However the person behind the counter gave her a cup with only a few ounces of the drink in it.

She asked for the cup to be filled but was informed by the barista that doing so would incur a cost of an additional 70 cents. ""I’m crying I asked for no ice and she gave me this with a straight face"" superimposed text over the video reads.

While there were a lot of folks who thought that there wasn't any reason for baristas to fill up the cup as folks are paying a lot of money for coffee and it isn't coming out of their paychecks there was also some resistance to that notion in the comments section of the now-viral TikTok clip.

Many stated that the drinks called for pre-mixed per-serving recipes. Others stated that if the beverage was espresso-based especially that asking for no ice in the drink would be the reason why it seemed like such a small amount.

The Friends of Harbour Town 1837 has sold Commodore’s Place 995 State St. and the 1909 Old Vermilion School House next door at 993 State St.

The new owner is the Vermilion Chamber Foundation a nonprofit affiliated with the Vermilion Chamber of Commerce.

The property transferred Jan. 11 according to Erie County Auditor’s records.

The Friends of Harbour Town 1837 will stay at the Commodore’s Place through the end of October said Kenneth M. Baughman organization president.

Meanwhile the Vermilion Chamber Foundation will develop a plan for the buildings said Sandra Coe executive director for the Vermilion Chamber of Commerce.

The Chamber will maintain its office at 5495 Liberty Ave.

State Street which is Ohio Route 60 is one of the main roads into Vermilion so a goal is to make it a nice site possibly with tourist information available Coe said.

New business aid

Vermilion Chamber Foundation leaders are looking to create an incubator space to help small businesses develop inside the Commodore’s Place Coe said.

Around Ohio and the United States cities have spaces where home-based business operators can rent room to grow she said.

Operators may not be able to afford or find a storefront but need more space than they have.

“Possibly we can help them out as the middle ground where they can come in and sell their products from our (space)” Coe said.

The community could benefit from additional tax dollars she said.

“We have some great ideas and it just takes time” Coe said. “Like I told my board Rome wasn’t built in a day and they’ve got some great ideas and things take time and money.”

Vermilion Chamber Foundation is a 501c3 nonprofit that can seek out various grants to help the space which will get a new name.

Foundation board includes President Shawn Kipp of Pat O’Brien Chevrolet; Treasurer Melody Ellison of the Vermilion branch of 5/3 Bank; and Secretary Nikki Dover of Smokin’ Joes/Country Breeze.

Retired Vermilion Municipal Court Judge Betsy Wakefield and Erie MetroParks Director Amy Bowman-Moore are members.

School house conditions

In the past Friends of Harbour Town 1837 and the city of Vermilion inspectors have disputed the condition of the school building.

Vermilion Chamber Foundation leaders will evaluate its condition and look at what’s best for the building and the community Coe said.

She declined to comment on options for repairs or demolition because the Foundation does not have a full evaluation of it yet.

Many people around town still know it as the Old Haunted School House Coe said.

For years it served as a haunted house fundraiser for the Friends group.

Commodores’ Place

In 2021 Friends of Harbour Town 1837 unveiled the remodeled Commodore’s Place and a rejuvenated 6000-square-foot event center with room for up to 320 people.

It was to be a rental venue to raise money for the preservation of the Old Vermilion School House which sits next door at 993 State St.

“Like all things the needed repairs exceeded our ability to make them happen” Baughmann said. “Donations and volunteers have fallen off dramatically within recent years.”

The novel coronavirus pandemic and other community factors significantly affected the Friends of Harbour Town group’s goals and community service projects he said.

“With limited funding available and dwindling volunteers some hard choices had to be made” Baughmann said.

The organization sold the property for $1 because “the Vermilion Chamber Foundation is in a far better position than we are currently with respect to volunteers and financing” he said.

Good for the neighborhood

The sale was the right choice for the neighborhood Baughman said.

If put up for sale to anyone the property would have sold for more money but it also is one of the few remaining properties zoned industrial in Vermilion he said.

Hypothetically “a meat processing plant or other noisy industrial company could have acquired the property and done with it anything they wanted to do in the middle of a quiet historically centered neighborhood of quaint homes” Baughmann said.

“A commercial sale would have disturbed the neighbors and we simply did not want that to happen so this was our only logical option” he said.

Not the end

The sale does not mean the end of the Friends of Harbour Town 1837 Baughman said.

“There is a difference between down and out and downsizing” he said. “The Friends of Harbourtown has supported the community for over 52 years and we hope to be able to continue that support for as long as we are willing and able.”

Friends of Harbour Town 1837 will keep ownership of the adjacent train depot which is fully restored with hopes that the 1909 Nickel Plate Railroad Caboose there could be placed next to it.

The caboose would make a nice addition to Vermilion’s historical charm Baughman said suggesting Victory Park as a potential new site for it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zYXZhbm5haG5vdy5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL2hpZ2gtc2Nob29sLzIwMjIvMDIvMjcvc3QtYW5kcmV3cy11c2VkLXRvdWdoLWVhcmx5LXNlYXNvbi1zY2hlZHVsZS1wcmVwYXJlLXN0YXRlLXRpdGxlLXJ1bi16eWVyZS1lZHdhcmRzLXpheWRlbi1lZHdhcmRzLzY5MzMxMTAwMDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,St. Andrew's School boys basketball's road to GISA state championship,"St. Andrew's School boys basketball coach Mel Abrams has stressed defense with his talented Lions team all season and he made sure his squad was battle-tested by scheduling a rugged non-region schedule.

His focus on important details paid off Saturday as the Lions edged John Milledge Academy 49-47 to win the Georgia Independent School Association Class 3A state championship in a game played at Georgia Southwestern State in Americus.

The Lions closed out the season on a 14-game win streak — the second-longest in school history — and finished the memorable campaign with a 25-4 record.

St. Andrew's was knocked out of the playoffs by John Milledge last year so this win was especially sweet. But the Trojans (22-3) gave the Lions everything they had — hitting four 3-pointers in the first quarter and jumping out to an 18-8 lead.

But St. Andrew's clamped down defensively and didn't allow a point in the second quarter to take a 25-21 lead at intermission.

""We did it; I'm so proud of this team"" said Mel Abrams in his seventh year leading the program. ""John Milledge got off to a great start but for us to outscore them 10-0 in the second quarter that was huge. John Milledge is a good defensive team but we showed we were better tonight and it was a collective effort as a team.""

Junior Zyere Edwards emerged as one of the best players in the Coastal Empire this season and he came through in the clutch for the Lions in the biggest game of the season with 27 points. He set school records for most points in a season with 685 and most 3-pointers made with 90.

His younger brother freshman Zayden Edwards scored eight points Saturday and set school season records for a freshman for points (385) and rebounds (176).

Junior Kaleb Lofton had an impressive performance with 11 points in the win and sophomore Jaylen Sheppard had a solid game on both ends of the court Abrams said.

It was the first state title for the Lions since 2004 the fourth in school history and the first at the Class 3A level.

""It felt really good to see how the boys executed and played so well under pressure"" Abrams said. ""We prepared ourselves early in the season to put us in this position and we were ready for it.""

Zyere Edwards said he had a feeling it was going to be a good day for the Lions at the team shootaround on Saturday morning.

""We just seemed so locked in we were prepared and in a good position to win"" he said. ""We neutralized their two best players with our defense and rebounding. Our defense helped us get out in transition and get our offense going.""

Zayden Edwards said getting a chance to win a title with his big brother was an experience he'll never forget.

""He's such a great player and teammate with his shooting passing and defense. He was our leader this year"" Zayden Edwards said. ""And we've got almost everyone coming back so we're hoping to win it his senior year. We want to go back to back.""

JAMES — The 1971-72 school year started out on a positive note for St. James High School athletic teams.

The Saints’ football team went 7-2 – with the only losses coming to Fairmont by eight points and Blue Earth by two points.

The boys cross country team won the District 6 Meet and finished second at the Region 2 Meet to qualify for the state meet.

That early success was a harbinger of the most memorable year in school history which was highlighted by two state championships.

This weekend is the 50th anniversary of the first of the two titles.

On Feb. 26 1972 the Saints wrestling team capped the three-day state meet at Williams Arena on the University of Minnesota campus with a first-place finish.

The state title was the first for a St. James team since 1954 when the Saints won the boys tennis state title. The unbeaten Saints football team in 1953 was named the “mythical” state champion by the Minneapolis Tribune.

After capturing the wrestling title St. James would only have to wait a month for its next state title.

On March 25 at Williams Arena the Saints defeated Melrose in the Class 1A championship basketball game. Two nights later the Saints wrapped up a record-setting unbeaten season with a victory in a playoff game with Mounds View which had won the Class 2A title.

Jim Augustin and Jeff Nessler who were starters on the Saints football team played key roles in the two state titles.

Augustin reached the 112-pound championship match at the state meet while Nessler led the basketball team in scoring and made the game-winning basket in the victory over Melrose.

“Before the year began we knew we were going to have a good season” said Augustin. “But we didn’t know how special it was going to be.”

The Saints coached by Paul Krueger were the Region 2 runner-up the previous two seasons. They finished the regular season unbeaten in dual meets while winning two invitationals before outdistancing Blue Earth to win the South Central Conference Meet. The Saints had 141 points while the runner-up Buccaneeers had 92.

The Saints then won the District 6 Meet and the Region 2 Meet. At the regional meet in Worthington the Saints had six champions – Jake Hodgkinson (105 pounds) Augustin (112) Jeff Nelson (119 Kevin Kuehl (132) Tom Knickrehm (155) and Dave Johnson (167). Nate Winkelman the runner-up at 98 pounds gave the Saints seven individuals in the state meet. The seven state qualifiers were the most by any school in 1972.

Sherburn’s Dave Cain (145 champion) and Rick Kempert (132 runner-up) and Jackson’s Randy Baker (126 champion) also advanced to the state meet.

At the state meet Hodgkinson Augustin and Kuehl advanced to championship matches. In the semifinals Augustin defeated Janesville’s Jack Eustice 4-0. Hodgkinson got a takedown with 20 seconds to defeat Herb Pellinen of Hutchinson 6-4 and Kuehl pinned his opponent.

Nelson took third place and Knickrehm took fifth. Cain was the runner-up at 145.

The Saints didn’t have an individual champion but six of the seven wrestlers scored points as the Saints finished with 59 points to win the state title – the state meet didn’t begin the current dual-meet format until 1975. Osseo which had three individual state champions was second with 49 points and defending state champion Albert Lea was third with 39.

“Everything has to click to have a season like that” said Augustin. “As the season went along we started putting everything together. After we won our own tournament and the Robbinsdale tournament we knew we had a good team. We really had a good bunch of guys.”

Nessler and his basketball teammates were optimistic going into their season.

“We had a lot of people back” said Nessler “and we thought we had a good team. We had good depth and everyone knew their roles. And it all fell into place.”

The Saints the Region 2 runner-up in 1971 started their season with six consecutive victories before defeating Worthington and Renville in their own holiday tournament.

The Saints then closed out the regular season with a 57-45 victory over unbeaten Wells.

The Saints coached by Arnold Veglahn won the District 6 title – defeating unbeaten Mapleton in the championship game.

At the Region 2 tournament the Saints defeated Luverne which had defeated them in the 1971 region championship game in the semifinals and then defeated Windom for their first trip to the state tournament since 1954.

Nessler said the Saints were inspired by the wrestling team.

“(All season) we had rooted for each other” said Nessler. “After the wrestling team won the title we said let’s go up there and give it a shot.”

The Saints opened Class 1A state tournament play with a six-point victory over St. Paul Murray. The Saints followed that with an 82-57 victory over Red Wing which was the Class 1A runner-up in 1971 in the semifinals.

The championship game against defending Class 1A champion Melrose provided one of the most memorable shots in the history of the state tournament.

With the Saints and Melrose tied in the final 10 seconds Saints guard Jeff Nessler got the ball near midcourt and lofted a shot from about 40 to 45 feet. The shot was good and lifted the Saints to a 57-55 victory over Melrose. The Saints then defeated Mounds View 60-52.

The Saints’ 29 victories were a state record as St. James became the first school in state history to win a basketball and wrestling title in the same year.

“At a small school like St. James” said Nessler “you think a good year is if you win the district title. Anything after that is great. You don’t think about going 29-0.”

Augustin said “the most amazing thing is that both teams went unbeaten 18-0 and 29-0. 336 wrestling teams in the state started the season. They all had a shot.”

Augustin credited the Saints’ coaches.

“We were so fortunate” said Augustin. “We got great coaching from Paul (Krueger) (assistant coach) Bill Mohr and (junior high coach) Al Adams. They were great communicators and coordinated the program.”

Nessler agreed “Paul was a social studies teacher. He was really supportive. Our coaches really supported us and we have memories that have stayed with us.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVsYW50ZXJuLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAyL3dvbWVucy1ob2NrZXktbm8tMi1vaGlvLXN0YXRlLWRlZmVhdHMtc3QtY2xvdWQtc3RhdGUtMy0wLWFkdmFuY2VzLXRvLXdjaGEtZmluYWwtZmFjZW9mZi1zZW1pZmluYWxzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Women's Hockey: No. 2 Ohio State defeats St. Cloud State 3-0 advances to WCHA Final Faceoff semifinals,"The Ohio State women’s hockey team’s 3-0 victory against St. Cloud State Saturday earned them a spot in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association’s Final Faceoff semifinals.

No. 2 Ohio State (27-6-0 23-5-0) swept its quarterfinals series against St. Cloud State (9-23-3 4-22-3) at the Ohio State Ice Rink advancing to the next round of play March 5 against No. 4 Wisconsin in Minneapolis.

Head coach Nadine Muzerall said the Buckeyes played together and controlled most of the game.

“We just had to work a little bit harder to get inside and when we did we scored a couple” Muzerall said.

Muzerall said St. Cloud State played a great game especially on its penalty kill of which it limited the Buckeyes to two scores on eight power play opportunities.

“It made a problem for our power play that’s usually pretty effective” Muzerall said. “I thought they played with a lot of heart today.”

Ohio State senior goaltender Andrea Braendli returned between the pipes for the first time since she competed for Team Switzerland at the 2022 Winter Olympics. Braendli made 11 saves shutting out the Huskies.

Braendli said she was excited to be back on the ice for the Buckeyes and she missed wearing the scarlet and gray jersey.

“The team really helped me out there” Braendli said. “Made it really easy for me to save the shots that I had. It makes me really excited for what’s next.”

After being scratched last game Ohio State junior forward Kenzie Hauswirth found the back of the net in the first period and was awarded a goal. The goal would not stay on the board for long as St. Cloud State won an offsides challenge keeping it a 0-0 game.

Ohio State senior forward Gabby Rosenthal got the puck past St. Cloud State graduate goaltender Emma Polusny putting the Buckeyes on the board 1-0 going into the second period. Rosenthal said it was a great play off the faceoff and she was happy to net the first goal for the Buckeyes.

“It was a big moment to get us on the board” Rosenthal said. “We had a lot of momentum. We had a lot of shots. We just had to break a good goalie.”

Muzerall said Rosenthal has a lot of speed and constantly wins battles in front of the net.

“Gabby is a complete 200-foot hockey player and I would say arguably one of the best centermans in the country” Muzerall said. “I’m glad she gets rewarded again. I’m proud of her.”

Ohio State graduate forward and captain Liz Schepers scored her second goal of the series and 20th goal of the season in the second period making it a 2-0 game at the end of the frame. Rosenthal earned her second point of the night with an assist on Schepers’ goal.

Ohio State junior defender Lauren Bernard capitalized on a power play in the third period giving the Buckeyes a 3-0 victory. Muzerall said Bernard’s power-play group has struggled some this season and this game was their time.

“I thought it was a good reassurance goal for their confidence because they do do well” Muzerall said. “Bernard in particular because she’s had such a phenomenal season. It was nice that she gets rewarded for that.”

The Buckeyes outshot the Huskies in the game 35-11.

Phillips Memorial YMCA has been a recreational and learning venue for Columbus residents. During most of those years the pool has looked pretty much the same as when it was installed.

With the help of a donation from Steel Dynamics YMCA recently completed much needed repairs to ensure the Rob Jones Aquatic Center continues to serve the aquatic needs of Lowndes County residents.

The fitness center will host an open house and ribbon-cutting ceremony for the renovated pool starting at 10:30 a.m. Monday.

“It would be very hard to place a number on the people who have learned how to swim in this pool over the years” said Jimmy Woodruff executive director of the Columbus YMCA. “I learned how to swim here when I was 9 years old. It was an outdoor pool then and was such a fun and special place. Our family lived downtown and we could walk to the pool from our home.”

The Downtown Columbus Branch of the Frank P. Phillips Memorial YMCA officially became a YMCA (Young Men’s Christian Association) in April of 1924.

In 1930 the current building and outdoor pool located at 602 2nd Ave. N. were built at a cost of $75000. The pool built of concrete and Art Deco mosaic black and white tile was considered the best of its era.

Today the pool is an indoor heated facility and can serve members year round. The roof and walls were added and it was converted to the Rob Jones Aquatic Center in August 1999.

“In this day and time a pool to an athletic facility is just as important as the treadmills” Woodruff said. “It is the centerpiece of any YMCA. We use it to do a number of cardio and exercise classes to help our members improve their quality of life.”

“This pool has also been home to many of our Columbus championship swim teams and is home to our current team” he said.

Mickey Brislin learned how to swim at the YMCA pool when he was 5 years old. Then the pool was outdoors.

“It looks about like it did when it was new” he said while visiting the pool Friday with Woodruff.

Brislin was among the children who participated in the 1960 Columbus swim team that won a state championship. It was the first title the Columbus team ever received.

“After 1960 we won every year for about 10 to 15 years” he said of the swim team.

The pool in the aquatic center is 75 feet long and 30 feet wide. The swim lanes were increased from four to five for swim teams to practice and host local Golden Triangle area swim meet competitions Woodruff said.

The pool renovations began at the end of October. On the exterior the mosaic tiles were repaired Woodruff said. Then the surface of the pool was acid washed three times cracks repaired and all the tile was regrouted.

Renovations also included replacing the plumbing piping filter systems pool heaters chlorinator and pool pumps Woodruff said.

The pool deck was redone with a new “Cool Deck” gray stained textured surface that helps make the surface stay comfortable to bare feet in the heat of the summer.

The support beams for the roof of the center were also repaired. Everything inside was repainted.

The pool reopened on Feb. 7 for its first swimming lessons. A full slate of classes are scheduled throughout the remainder of the year Woodruff said. Check out the website at columbus-ymca.com for upcoming class schedules.

Everyone is invited to attend Monday’s open house.

“We have had so much interest and excitement from our members and the community as we have worked toward this day” stated Cynthia Mutch marketing and membership director of the Columbus YMCA. “We appreciate everyone’s patience as we have made the necessary renovations to our pool.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Menlo Park Calif.-based Gauss Surgical Inc. sold to Stryker Corp. in September for an undisclosed amount. Gauss Surgical developed a monitoring system known as Triton to provide clinicians an accurate estimate of a patient’s hemoglobin and blood loss during surgeries and births.

The same day Stryker (NYSE: SYK) announced the Gauss Surgical acquisition had closed San Francisco-based Invitae Corp. (NYSE: NVTA) said it bought Ciitizen Corp. a genetics testing company in Palo Alto. The Ciitizen deal valued at about $308.3 million consisted of about $87.4 million in cash and 6.3 million shares of common stock according to a federal securities regulatory filing by Invitae.

Health Care THE 4100 GROUP INC. Top executive: Mike Gilmore (president and CEO); Scott Lancaster (chief investment officer) Total Michigan employees: 9 Company description: Investment arm of Delta Dental of Michigan and Delta Dental of Ohio Advisers on the deal: Deals were handled internally

The two exits combined earned The 4100 Group a 2022 MiBiz M&A Deals and Dealmakers of the Year Award in the health care category.

Recording the exits after holding positions in each company for less than a year generated a strong return on investment and also created momentum for venture capital investing by the East Lansing-based 4100 Group.

“It was great to get a couple exits that early on” said Scott Lancaster the chief investment officer and managing director of private market investments for The 4100 Group. Lancaster called the exits a “great win.”

“It showed the board that we understand and we have very good deal flow and we were able to execute on interesting transactions and actually bring these companies to an exit. It certainly provides a confidence booster for our board going forward that we should continue having venture as an asset class as part of a broader portfolio” Lancaster said. “Financial returns are always nice but I think more so it’s the confidence internally for us that we’ll keep receiving additional capital and get support to continue doing venture capital.”

The 4100 Group acquired positions in Gauss Surgical and Ciitizen in 2020 from Spectrum Health Ventures LLC where Lancaster previously worked as clinical director.

Delta Dental of Michigan and Delta Dental of Ohio formed The 4100 Group in 2014 as a joint venture. Lancaster joined The 4100 Group in July 2020 and served on boards at both Gauss Surgical and Ciitizen following Spectrum Health Ventures’ initial investments. He brought to the firm expertise in venture capital while working with investment adviser Dr. Garrett Vyganta.

The 4100 Group initially focused on making later-stage equity investments primarily in the financial services sector and has been seeking add-on or tuck-in acquisitions to complement those holdings.

Grand Rapids institutional asset management firm Red Cedar Investment Management LLC is among The 4100 Group’s present portfolio companies. The 4100 Group also owns a wealth advisory firm in Cleveland as well as Lansing I.T. solutions company Dewpoint Inc. which has an office in Grand Rapids.

The firm has made several venture capital financings Lancaster said. One of the most recent deals closed in December and involved participating with other investors in a $30 million growth capital raise for Palo Alto Calif.-based Vynca Health Care that developed a palliative care platform.

The 4100 Group also has an equity investment pending in an Ann Arbor genomics company Lancaster said adding that the firm has a strong pipeline of investment prospects.

“The market’s great” Lancaster said. “There’s more stuff than we can look at.”

The Gauss Surgical and Ciitizen exits follow The 4100 Group’s deployment of its initial capital allocation from Delta Dental.

Work continues to set up a new venture capital fund in excess of $100 million for which The 4100 Group will serve as the anchor limited partner. The fund will invest in life sciences companies in their early stages and could make its first investment by the end of the first quarter Lancaster said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Now there's trouble,"Helpful? Or too helpful? Shutterstock

Let's talk about security.

In relationships that is.

It's so much easier to lose your trust in someone than to commit your trust to someone.

Worse when you do finally trust someone that trust can be threatened in an instant.

This leads me to the other sort of security the one that rarely seems to exist in technology. It also leads me to the tale of a woman who may have had doubts about the man she loved. Or at least the man she was married to.

He'd apparently been calling and texting someone. You know someone else.

So she went to a T-Mobile store and asked for a favor.

I only know all this because a T-Mobile store employee -- handle @lizzylizzyyy -- claimed she was so happy to help this woman that she made a little in-store TikTok video about it.

It was captioned: ""When I help a customer find the phone number her husband has been calling and texting the last couple of months.""

The video didn't show the actual conversation between the T-Mobile employee and the wife which is a pity. It did however offer a little dance performed by the T-Mobile employee after she'd performed her customer service duties.

I can already feel you tensing in several places.

Should T-Mobile employees really be inserting themselves in marital spats? Should they not think about issues of say privacy? Should they really not be making TikTok videos about their private interactions with customers even if those videos enjoy a happy dance?

And do we really know what precisely may have happened here?

It's possible the customer had a family account with her husband and wanted the T-Mobile employee to pull up the latest statements. It's possible she merely asked for an act of sisterhood in order to expose an allegedly wayward man. It's even possible this is all a joke.

Indeed after more than 175000 people watched the video @lizzylizyyy suddenly insisted: ""First of all it's a joke this never happened and second of all I never said I went into an account did I?""

She could have stopped at insisting it was a joke couldn't she?

Some commenters however insisted they had done this too. Some claimed to work for other carriers.

There were those of course who insisted this was a blatant breach of company policy.

Naturally some commenters wanted to know how they too could avail themselves of such an intimate T-Mobile service in an ""asking for a friend"" kind of way.

There's another equally important aspect to all this.

Many people -- many from younger generations especially -- are so conversant with technology and its modern demands that they might think little of privacy or security. Or corporate rules.

They might think everything of filming their work lives and putting them on social media. Indeed @lizzylizzyyy has posted other TikTok videos from her T-Mobile store showing (off) her happy work life.

Some companies frown on all this. A McDonald's employee recently claimed she was fired for posting TikToks videos of her daily life at work. Many thought these videos showed her simply doing her job very well.

What's clear is that T-Mobile isn't happy about this particular customer service video.

When I asked the company for its feelings a spokesperson told me: ""We have safeguards in place to protect customer information and we will investigate this to understand what actually occurred.""

This is hardly surprising. Even if the video is a joke -- and many will still have their suspicions that it isn't -- it's not a good ad for the brand. It suggests that employees will potentially breach privacy rules if they feel there's a need. It even suggests they'll be happy to do it.

Moreover for all humanity's moaning about privacy and security isn't the real truth is that we've rather given up?

We find it too hard to distinguish between what we think should be kept private and what we think should be on public display in order to gain us social brownie points.

Even when the consequences strike we mumble: ""Oh yeah. I suppose. I never thought of that.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL3RjbC0zMHYtMzB4ZS0zMDgyODQ2L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TCL launches two new 30-series phones for the US (Updated: Pricing),"TL;DR The TCL 30V is a brand new smartphone exclusive to the Verizon network in the United States.

Meanwhile the 30XE is exclusive to T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile.

Both phones launch soon but pricing is a mystery.

Update: February 27 2022 (11 AM ET): TCL has announced the prices for the Verizon-exclusive 30V 5G and T-Mobile-exclusive 30XE 5G. The phones will cost $299 and $199 respectively. Both phones are now available for purchase from their respective carriers. Original article: January 4 2022: TCL is relatively new to making smartphones under its own branding with only two years under its belt. It’s now in the swing of things though and at CES 2022 it launched two new phones for the US market. See also: The best budget phones you can currently buy

The TCL 30V and TCL 30XE are the first phones in the 30 series to hit the US. Both are 5G-capable but you’ll need to be on either Verizon or T-Mobile to get them.

Below you’ll find what you need to know about each device!

TCL 30V: Just for Verizon

TCL

The “V” in the TCL 30V name might stand for Verizon but it might as well. This is a phone exclusive to Big Red in the United States.

Since Verizon’s 5G network is primarily based on mmWave tech it shouldn’t be surprising to hear the 30V supports both Sub-6 and mmWave connections. The relatively weak Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 chipset enables those connections. Required reading: What you should know about mmWave and Sub-6 5G

Under the hood the TCL 30V has 4GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. It has a microSD card slot if you need up to 1TB of extra space. Android 11 powers the phone and it stays alive with a 4500mAh battery. That battery charges at 18W wired but there’s no wireless charging.

On the front you’ll find a 6.67-inch FHD+ (2400 x 1080) display. It has a refresh rate of 60Hz unfortunately and is covered with the quite old Gorilla Glass 3. A centered cutout exposes the selfie camera which is a 16MP shooter capable of capturing video at 1080p/30fps.

On the back you’ll find a triple camera array. The primary shooter is a 50MP wide and it’s flanked with a 5MP ultrawide and a 2MP macro. Next to the camera array you’ll find a trusty capacitive fingerprint scanner.

TCL wouldn’t divulge when you’ll be able to get the 30V nor how much it will cost. All it would cop to is a release date “in the coming weeks” and a price announcement with the same vague promise.

TCL 30XE: For T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile

TCL

If you don’t have Verizon and want a TCL 30 series phone in the US your next best bets will be T-Mobile or Metro by T-Mobile. The two carriers will sell the TCL 30XE.

This is also a 5G device but does not have mmWave support. That will no doubt make it cheaper than the 30V but TCL won’t tell us how much it’s going to cost or when you’ll be able to get it.

On the front the 30XE has a 6.52-inch screen with a low-resolution display (just 1600 x 720). Thankfully that display does have a 90Hz refresh rate which should make it a bit nicer to use. The relatively weak DragonTrail 3 glass covers the screen. See also: The best T-Mobile phones to spend your money on

Inside a MediaTek Dimensity 700 acts as the processor. It’s paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. Once again there’s a microSD card slot if you need extra space but it’s limited to 512GB cards at the max. The 4500mAh battery should last you a long time but TCL wouldn’t divulge how fast it can charge.

On the back the TCL 30XE has a triple-lens camera module. That’s a 13MP wide a 2MP depth sensor and a 2MP macro. In other words this will not be a photography or videography powerhouse. There’s also a capacitive fingerprint scanner back there.

So when the Islamic State militant group commonly known as ISIS emerged in Iraq in 2014 the Swedish firm Ericsson went to extreme lengths to keep operating there. Between 2011 and 2019 Ericsson and its vendors bribed public officials paid protection money and exposed employees and contractors to dire threats an internal company report shows. Ericsson did this even as it negotiated a settlement of charges that it had violated anti-corruption laws elsewhere in the world.

Why take the risk? Leaked company documents do not answer that question directly. But experts point to the high-stakes struggle for global dominance in an industry made more fiercely competitive by what could become a multitrillion-dollar market in the next decade: the new generation of mobile phone technology known as 5G.

That race said Robert Atkinson founder and president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation is most intense in battleground markets like Iraq.

5G: The next wireless technology

Telecom companies develop the infrastructure that makes a wireless network function like cell towers and radio access network equipment. The next stage of that technology 5G represents an evolutionary leap forward. 5G is the tech world’s response to an increase in smart devices congesting radio frequencies — similar to the way too many vehicles can jam a highway.

By opening up more frequencies 5G promises shorter lag times and faster download speeds. It also makes it easier for appliances connected to the internet to communicate enabling for example vehicles to signal one another to avoid collisions. But 5G also poses privacy concerns as more and more data — some of it as personal as how many eggs are left in your smart refrigerator or the video feed from your baby monitor — travels across networks.

This next-generation technology could generate $12.3 trillion in sales worldwide by 2035 according to analytics firm IHS Markit.

Ericsson vs. Huawei

Ericsson controls nearly 15% of the global market for telecom infrastructure according to research firm Dell’Oro Group. The company’s largest market is the United States and it has received more than $113 million in U.S. government contracts since 2008. In early 2021 Ericsson won an $8.3 billion contract its largest ever awarded by Verizon one of the biggest U.S. wireless carriers to provide radio access network equipment over five years.

As big as Ericsson is it is dwarfed by the state-backed Chinese giant Huawei Technologies Co. which controls about 30% of the global market. Huawei reported early last year that it had signed more than 1000 5G contracts worldwide. Some experts say China’s aggressive economic policies promoting exports and limiting imports have unfairly propelled Huawei ahead of its competition.

The third major player is Finland-based Nokia. Nokia’s largest contracts include a 2018 deal worth $3.5 billion to expedite 5G deployment for U.S. carrier T-Mobile. Though Nokia controls about as much of the market as Ericsson it has been on the downswing for several years and recently lost a major Verizon contract to Samsung Electronics.

The West vs. China

The U.S. and some other Western democracies view Huawei as an agent of the Chinese government and they are intent on keeping the company out. As evidence of Huawei’s subservience to the state they point to Chinese laws that require Huawei to turn over company data to the government if asked potentially risking the security of Huawei customers.

An even bigger fear is that in the event of a global conflict China might direct Huawei to sever services causing major disruptions. In an instant entire nations could be locked out of banks hospitals and other providers of essential services.

“They could say ‘Hey we’re going to invade Taiwan and if you intervene we’ll shut down your 5G network remotely’” Atkinson said.

Sweden joined a handful of countries in 2020 that bar companies from working with Huawei or using Huawei equipment for their 5G networks. China retaliated awarding Ericsson a much smaller-than-expected share of Chinese 5G contracts.

The final battlegrounds

With the U.S. and other major democracies relying heavily on Ericsson while China uses Huawei equipment almost exclusively smaller Asian and African countries have become primary battlegrounds. Both companies have been accused of paying bribes and other abuses to win contracts and secure control of more territory.

A U.S. Justice Department investigation found that Ericsson had committed ethical breaches in five countries according to a 2019 deferred prosecution agreement. The violations include bribing officials in Djibouti China’s foothold in Africa.

In an interview Jacob Helberg a senior adviser at the Stanford University Center on Geopolitics and Technology said Huawei’s actions have been even worse. He said the company’s extensive history of offering bribes to political leaders has distorted the market. “Other telecoms that want to compete with these state-backed actors like Huawei are under a lot of pressure to engage in similar practices in order to be competitive” Helberg said.

After revelations of widespread corruption Ericsson announced that the company would improve its ethics and compliance program. Huawei on the other hand has dismissed many allegations of dodgy business dealings stating on its website “Huawei believes that corruption severely damages fair market competition and is a threat to the development of our society economy and enterprises.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBob25lYXJlbmEuY29tL25ld3MvaG93LXRvLWZpeC1nb29nbGUtbWVzc2FnZXMtb24tZ2FsYXh5LXMyMi1zZXJpZXNfaWQxMzg3MTXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to fix the problems with the Google Messages app on the Galaxy S22 line,"As you might know in the states the Samsung Galaxy S22 line comes with the Google Messages app pre-installed . Unlike the messages apps offered by carriers like Verizon Google Messages features Rich Communication Services (RCS) which gives it some of the same capabilities as Apple's Messages app.





Since it uses your phone's data connection instead of a cellular connection Google Messages can accommodate longer messages with many more characters share longer video clips and has additional features including encryption. It also allows users to receive read receipts and see when someone is writing a response to them. In other words many of the things that Apple's Messages app can do RCS can do as well.

When Samsung announced that U.S. variants of the Galaxy S22 series were being pre-installed with the Google Messages app this seemed like a huge win for Google. But on Reddit  a large number of Galaxy S22 buyers complained that they were having problems with the app.





One Redditor who goes by the name ""ratmazter"" wrote ""I had the same issue with my S22 that arrived Monday. I updated Carrier Services cleared cache rebooted the whole shabang. Several hours later RCS Chat finally connected. However like you mentioned it's showing powered by my carrier AT&T and not Jibe. Therein lies my problem - it doesn't Chat with users that don't have AT&T.""





""I'm gonna try to uninstall this Samsung skinned version and install the Google Messages APK from xda's site"" he continued. ""Just not liking the Samsung skin at all. I think AT&T hijacked this in collusion with Samsung and again making it a bad app experience for users.""





The problem is that T-Mobile and AT&T subscribers with the Galaxy S22 series will be using the backend for the Google Messages app provided by their carrier. But there seems to be a delay in getting users' data moved over to AT&T and T-Mobile's servers from Google's servers. As a result we are seeing plenty of complaints from users.





To help speed up the process Google put up a support page that tells you to enter your phone number at https://messages.google.com/disable-chat . Once you do that open the Messages app on your Galaxy S22 series phone and open the Messages settings go to Chat features and toggle on Enable chat features. Once that is done your phone will automatically be signed up with the backend belonging to AT&T or T-Mobile depending on which one you use.

Cisco’s enhanced IoT SaaS platform fulfills industry needs for more simplified data management at massive scale.

Cisco helps service providers expand into new markets and enable a broad range of IoT uses cases.

Cisco IoT Control Center manages all licensed cellular network connectivity giving service providers and enterprise customers choice and flexibility.

BARCELONA – Mobile World Congress – February 28 2022 – Cisco today announced advancements to its internet of things (IoT) portfolio to help its service provider customers offer a simpler way to manage LPWAN/4G/5G IoT connectivity for new and emerging use cases.

As industries look to evolve their digital strategies in support of hybrid work they need simplified solutions to connect and manage low-cost often-stationary devices deployed at massive scale (Mass IoT) such as utility meters medical devices and agricultural sensors.

Introduced today at Mobile World Congress Barcelona Cisco IoT Control Center now fulfills industry needs for Mass IoT with a new simplified and secure connectivity management package purpose-built for lower complexity IoT devices. Cisco IoT Control Center manages nearly 200 million devices today across all licensed cellular networks (LPWAN/4G/5G) giving operators and enterprises the flexibility to choose the network that works best for their use case.

With low bandwidth consumption and predictable usage patterns stationary devices are often connected over wide areas with 3GPP LPWAN networks. LPWAN supports a broad range of IoT use cases – from a water meter that sends a burst of data once a week to a city parking meter that handles transactions throughout the day and night. Remote management for these devices is less complex than those requiring continuous real-time mission critical data collection such as connected cars.

With its new Cisco IoT Control Center offer delivered as a subscription service service providers can now address the full range of enterprise use cases - from low-to-high complexity from a single platform. The new offer reduces connectivity management complexity and costs without compromising quality making it practical and profitable for service providers to drive new revenue streams and capitalize on new Mass IoT market opportunities.

""We are always looking for ways to make IoT more valuable and easier to use for our customers and now Cisco enables KPN IoT to profitably capitalize on LPWAN market opportunities via the IoT Control Center"" says Carolien Nijhuis EVP Internet of Things and Dataservices at KPN. ""Offering our enterprise customers a single platform to address the full range of IoT use cases is a great advantage and reduces complexity in our customer's deployments leverages existing integrations and improves cost efficiency.""

""We are very pleased to see the new Mass IoT capabilities available on the IoT Control Center platform“ says Marc Overton Managing Director Division X for BT's Enterprise business. ""These will enable the pursuit of emerging low-cost low-complexity IoT segments with a solution that better meets customers’ needs.""

“We strive to help our service provider customers enable new services and business outcomes for Mass IoT to simplify data collection from millions of devices” said Masum Mir Vice President and General Manager Cable Mobile and IoT Cisco. “With these enhancements to Cisco IoT Control Center our customers can expand into the LPWAN market using a proven platform to help a broad range of growing industries realize what the future of mobile IoT can do to transform their business.”

I was heartened to read last week about a 13-year-old girl named Eva Szechenyi who donated $1200 to the Phoenix Center in Nutley a private special needs school that her cousin Erin once attended.

Eva raised $700 of that amount selling yarn bracelets. The other $500 was money that Eva saved from her allowance.

Bravo Eva!

But enough about her. Let’s get to me: When I was Eva’s age my parents gave me an allowance of $2.50 a week. If I had put aside 10% of that spectacularly generous splash o’ cash I would have been able to make a $500 donation in roughly 38 years.

Oh and I know nothing about yarn bracelets. So if I had wanted to make a $1200 donation to say Phoenix House St. Jude’s Hospital or those Shriners kids on TV with all those “adorable” (ugly) blankets it would have taken me 92.3 years.

Of course that’s assuming I actually put the money in a safe place and didn’t dip into it periodically to make my weekly donation to the Jack Daniels Corporation go to Carvel and/or pay off the second mortgage I took out so I could pay my Verizon bill.

Ervolino:How Bill Ervolino and his dog battle pandemic weight gain together

This brings us to that age-old question: Should kids get an allowance? And if so how much?

This is a moot point for me since: 1. I do not have children and 2. Even if I did I probably wouldn’t let them in the house.

As it happens the topic was broached recently by the T. Rowe Price annual Parents Kids and Money Survey. The results which I stumbled over earlier this month showed that 75% of parents do give their children allowances.

The mean allowance amount came to $19.30 a week with 22% of parents giving their kids $21 to $50 per week and 7% giving their kids $50 or more.

Is this good bad or what? I have no idea although I do know that my paltry allowance did teach me the value of a buck encouraged me to have multiple part-time jobs (from the time I was 14) and enabled me to save enough cabbage to move out of my parents’ house when I was 21.

Story continues after gallery

Millennials or those born from 1985 on got a lot more than $2.50 a week and plan on living with their parents until they are 68 years old.

(Millennials hate baby boomers for saying things like this but hardly any of them know what a newspaper is so I’m expecting very little blowback.)

Experts generally agree that allowances assuming they are dispensed in exchange for household chores and errands help children understand how the world works when you’re not an heiress.

For some reason though parents who learned this the hard way often feel they would prefer that their kids not have to do what they did.

And I have to admit this makes me a little envious. Many of these kids don’t do much work-wise until they finish college. They don’t mow lawns. They don’t rake leaves. They don’t shovel snow. They don’t do anything.

Not that I do any of these things either but it would be nice to have some cheap labor once in a while.

Ervolino:A pork chop reveals a truth about dental care for seniors: there are no affordable options

Years ago my cousins asked if I could help out with their Easter egg hunt which I assumed meant dyeing eggs and hiding them around their yard.

“No one does that anymore” I was told. “We use plastic eggs and fill them with candy small toys and money.”

Money? There’s that word again!

My niece who was 8 years old at the time and was going to be in attendance told me that some of the eggs would have $20 inside.

I gasped and told her that was incredible to me. “There were no Easter eggs with money in them when I was kid.”

“Really? What was in your eggs?”

I said “My eggs had eggs in them. Real eggs. You know: white and yolks and that’s all folks.”

She couldn’t believe it.

“If there was no money in them” she said “why did you look for them?”

“Because it was a tradition. It was fun. It involved human interaction.”

“What’s that?”

I’ve forgotten.

Anyway as I said I don’t have kids. But I doubt I could afford them. I understand they want $50 to rake and $100 to shovel.

If you want them to mow the lawn all summer you have to pay them in bitcoin.

And heaven only knows what it would run you to have the basement cleaned.

Coercion! Extortion! Bribes!

It’s worse than Congress.

While most of Wall Street focuses on large-cap and mega-cap stocks as they provide a degree of safety and liquidity many investors are limited in the number of shares they can buy. Many of the biggest public companies especially the technology giants trade in the hundreds all the way up to over $1000 per share or more. At those steep prices it is difficult to get any decent share count leverage.

Many investors especially more aggressive traders look at lower-priced stocks as a way not only to make some good money but to get a higher share count. That can really help the decision-making process especially when you are on to a winner as you can always sell half and keep half.

Gabe Newell aims to keep Steam away from “sketchy” NFT scene

Speaking to Rock Paper Shotgun‘s James Archer Gabe Newell said “at one point Steam was accepting cryptocurrencies for payments. And it turned out that it just made customers super mad. There was the issue of volatility: you don’t want your pricing to vary when anchored to people’s wages.”

Newell feels that the NFT scene is comprised of “criminal activity and a lot of sketchy behaviors” and are “not people you really are wanting to be doing business with.”

Using cryptocurrency seemed to be more hassle than it was worth for Steam and its customers too with Newell commenting on the confusing state of purchases: “Why did I spend $497 one day to buy a game and the next day I spent 47 cents what’s going on here? Volatility is a bad thing in a medium of exchange. That was one problem that sort of volatility was creating more pain for our customers than the value of having the option of using cryptocurrencies.”

“The vast majority of those transactions for whatever reason were fraudulent where people were repudiating transactions or using illegal sources of funds and things like that” added Newell.

More than 520000 people have fled Ukraine into Poland and other neighbouring countries in the wake of Russia’s invasion the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) has said.

The latest and still growing count had 281000 people entering Poland more than 84500 in Hungary about 36400 in Moldova over 32500 in Romania and about 30000 in Slovakia UNHCR spokeswoman Shabia Mantoo said. The rest were scattered in unidentified other countries she added.

Most of the arrivals have been women and children. All men aged between 18 and 60 have been prevented from leaving Ukraine to stay and fight.

Poland which was already home to an estimated 1.5 million Ukrainians before Russia’s invasion and which has expressed steadfast support for Ukraine has so far seen the bulk of those fleeing Ukraine cross into its territory.

Global visa requirements for Ukrainians

On Friday Ireland announced it was immediately lifting visa requirements for Ukrainians. The UN said the number of people seeking refuge outside of Ukraine to other countries could rise to five million. Several European countries are preparing for an influx of Ukrainian refugees and have offered humanitarian help. The US said it was providing emergency aid but signalled that Europe should be their primary destination.

Ukrainians can travel to some 140 countries and territories without the need for a visa or with a visa on arrival. The map below shows the visa requirements for Ukrainians as of February 26.

Closed airspace and cancelled flights

Ukraine closed its airspace to civilian flights on February 24 citing a high risk to safety. Russia also closed its airspace for civilian flights on its western border with Ukraine and Belarus. Several airlines have cancelled flights to Kyiv. The European Union said it would restrict exports of aircraft parts to Russia.

In recent weeks dozens of countries have urged their citizens to leave Ukraine. Many airlines have generally avoided flying over eastern Ukraine since 2014 after Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down over separatist-held territory. All 298 people on board 198 of whom were Dutch citizens were killed.

The map below shows the flights over Europe on February 26.

Ukraine’s main population centres

Ukraine has an estimated population of 44 million – the seventh-largest in Europe. The country comprises 24 regions known as oblasts. The country’s population has declined since the 1990s with fertility rates among the lowest in the world. As of 2020 Ukraine’s fertility rate was just 1.2. For context in order for a population to remain stable an overall total fertility rate of 2.1 is required.

Ukraine is the second-largest country in Europe after Russia. At 603550sq km (233031sq miles) Ukraine is a bit smaller than the US state of Texas about three times smaller than India half the size of South Africa and about two and a half times the size of the UK.

The map below shows where the country’s inhabitants are concentrated.

Conflict at a glance

After months of tensions and intense diplomacy Russian forces launched a “special military operation” in Ukraine on February 24. Explosions were heard across the country. Kyiv declared martial law saying Ukraine will defend itself.

On Saturday fighting reached the streets of Ukraine’s capital as Russia presses ahead with its invasion. Below is a summary of the conflict at a glance."

Through a carrot-and-stick approach investors and banks (and soon governments) use ESG to push businesses to change how they function regardless of what the employees and customers of those businesses want. In many cases however corporate executives are all too willing to go along because they want access to the cheap capital offered by investors and financial institutions.

The widespread adoption of ESG metrics which is also commonly called “stakeholder capitalism”—is meant to radically alter how businesses are evaluated expanding considerations beyond traditional economic metrics like profit revenue debt customer satisfaction and product development.

Instead of looking at economic and financial considerations ESG social credit metrics measure things like “Percentage of active workforce covered under collective bargaining agreements” (union labor) and “Percentage of employees per employee category by age group gender and other indicators of diversity (e.g. ethnicity).”

(To learn more about the basics of ESG read my ESG primer here or watch my recorded presentation for The Heartland Institute here.)

Unlike many corporations which spend substantial time and resources self-reporting ESG individual investors and most small businesses typically do not produce their own ESG reports. Instead large financial services companies and banks have produced them for these groups often without individuals or businesses asking for the reports.

For instance Merrill Lynch a division of Bank of America produces ESG scores for all or nearly all of its individual investment accounts even for those whose value is $1000 or less.

Moody’s has created an “ESG Score Predictor” that offers users with ESG reports for 100000 businesses many of which have never produced their own ESG metrics. Moody’s algorithm predicts scores by using “company size location and industry as inputs.”

When individuals and small businesses have raised concerns about the use of ESG and how it could be used against them—as opposed to merely being applied to corporations for the benefit of investors—banks investment groups and their lobbyists have claimed that concerns over ESG are nothing but “conspiracy theories.”

However the evidence shows that there are very good reasons to believe that financial institutions and banks plan to dramatically expand the use of ESG soon for individuals families and small businesses a move that would dramatically change the U.S. economy and society. Below are the five most important reasons for all Americans to be concerned.

1. There Are Already Many Examples of Individuals and Businesses Being Denied Access to Financial Services or Capital Based on Subjective Criteria

It’s impossible to know to what extent individuals organizations and businesses are now being denied access to financial services including loans based on subjective criteria because there are no databases nor reporting agencies tasked with compiling denials based on non-financial reasons. However news outlets have reported many examples of such actions and some industry reports openly admit that discrimination is common.

For example Deutsche Bank AG and Signature Bank announced in early 2021 that would no longer provide services to former President Donald Trump or his business the Trump Organization purely for ideological reasons.

In November 2021 WePay a J.P. Morgan Chase-owned payment processor informed the Missouri-based Defense of Liberty political action committee that it would stop offering its services to the organization after it planned an event featuring Donald Trump Jr. (Chase later reversed the decision but only after “Missouri treasurer Scott Fitzpatrick threatened to have the state stop doing business with the bank.”)

According to former North Dakota lawmaker Bette Grande “During the 2021 legislative session in North Dakota representatives of the lignite industry testified that coal operations are seeing increasing insurance premiums and a drop in the number of insurance companies willing to write insurance for any price. This is the ESG movement in action and it will not stop with oil and coal.”

Also in 2021 Sustainalytics an ESG business owned by Morningstar published a report titled How Sustainable Finance is Shaping Change in Banking. In the publication Sustainalytics notes:

Most major banks screen their lending portfolios against specific ESG risks as per the OECD Due Diligence guidance and many embrace negative or positive screening for potential corporate lending transactions or project finance transactions. Screening strategies filter potential transactions using predetermined ESG criteria to rule companies in or out of contention for financing. Negative screening and norm-based screening involve the exclusion or avoidance of transactions not aligned with environmental social and ethical standards. Exclusion criteria often include issues like weapon manufacturing tobacco sales or production of fossil fuels. While negative and norm-based screening are the most popular techniques used for ESG asset management these practices have been losing traction since 2015.

Positive screening on the other hand selects corporate borrowers that score highly on ESG factors relative to their peers. This can include best-in-class screening or the inclusion of investments in companies and sectors with higher ESG scores as compared to their peers or companies that are actively improving their ESG performance. This screening method does not necessarily exclude ESG laggards but rather focuses on those performing best with regards to ESG in relation to comparable companies or industries. In comparison to corporate lending transactions the intensity of screening is often higher for project finance transactions given due diligence requirements under the Equator Principles.

In 2020 Wells Fargo suspiciously closed a bank account belonging to Lauren Witzke a 2020 Republican candidate for the Delaware Senate.

The Heritage Foundation noted in a 2021 report that “PayPal has admitted to closing accounts flagged by the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2019 now PayPal has announced a partnership with the left-leaning Anti-Defamation League to focus on ‘further uncovering and disrupting the financial pipelines that support extremist and hate movements.'”

In 2019 the New York Post reported that J.P. Morgan Chase closed bank accounts associated with several political activists and commentators including Enrique Tarrio Joe Biggs Laura Loomer and Martina Markota—all within weeks of each other. According to the Post the activists said they were not given clear explanations for the cancellations.

In 2018 some large U.S. banks including Citibank rolled out restrictions for gun manufacturers and retailers. According to a report by the New York Times “They are restricting their credit card and banking services to gun retailers and halting lending to gun makers that do not comply with age limits and background check rules determined by the banks. They are also freezing out businesses that sell high-capacity magazines and ‘bump stocks’ attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire faster even though such products are legal under federal law.”

2. Credit Agencies Have Started to Alter Businesses’ Credit Ratings Based on ESG Scores

As noted in a 2021 sweeping report by Fitch Ratings—one of the “big three credit rating agencies” (along with Moody’s and S&P)—corporate credit rating agents already take ESG scores into account. And according to Fitch and others the use of ESG to alter credit ratings will almost certainly expand in the months and years to come.

If the largest agencies are willing to use ESG to alter corporate credit scores why wouldn’t credit agencies and banks do the same for individuals and small businesses?

3. Analysts Predict Individual Credit Scores Could Soon Have an ESG Component

Perhaps the most widely used service to check the creditworthiness of individuals and small business is FICO. When banks and credit unions examine applications for loans FICO is often the first place they turn. In an article published in December 2021 on FICO’s website titled “Lending Predictions 2022: From BNPL to ESG (and More)” a FICO senior principal consultant wrote that he believes in 2022 “The ESG Agenda Will Drive the Search for Cleaner Decisions.”

“In financial institutions much of the ESG agenda is delivered at the corporate level” the analyst wrote “but in 2022 we expect to see an increased focus on bringing ESG data into more granular lending and investment decisions. This will require increased innovation in the use of alternative data across all kinds of lending. One example would be the inclusion of property energy ratings data in mortgage valuation and decisioning and CO2 emission data for small businesses.”

He also noted “Over the longer term we expect that ESG and climate risk evaluations will become an integral element of credit risk and affordability assessments.”

This is a clear admission that ESG will likely soon be applied to individual and small business credit scores and/or other considerations such as mortgage applications.

4. Large Investment Management Firms and Banks Are Using ESG to Coerce Corporations

The primary stated purpose of ESG is to change corporations especially the largest and most powerful ones in order to produce more extensive societal impacts. This point is not in dispute. Everyone who understands ESG regardless of whether they support it or not agrees that it’s being used to alter corporate activities.

If you’re looking for specific examples of this however a good place to start is Larry Fink’s 2022 “Letter to CEOs” in which Fink sings the praises of “stakeholder capitalism” and promises to use ESG scores as a way to alter society. Fink is the head of Blackrock the world’s largest asset management company and is widely considered one of the most powerful people on Wall Street if not the most powerful person.

Of course Fink attempts to put a happy face on ESG and stakeholder capitalism throughout his letter but even he can’t help himself when discussing climate change making it clear that companies must choose between being leaders or being dragged into a net-zero economy against their will.

“Every company and every industry will be transformed by the transition to a net zero world” Fink wrote. “The question is will you lead or will you be led?”

The threats from Fink and others have largely worked. Accounting firm KPMG reports thousands of companies in dozens of countries have ESG systems in place including 82 percent of large companies in the United States. (And this data is now a couple of years old.)

If investors and banks are willing to utilize ESG to control corporations why wouldn’t they use ESG to manipulate individual and small business behavior as well?

5. Banks Have Promised to Use ESG to Fight Climate Change Throughout All of Their Portfolios and Business Activities

The largest and most influential banks and financial institutions in the United States much of Europe and Canada have openly said that they will use their tremendous amount of wealth to force the global economy to move to net-zero by at least 2050 and to halve CO2 emissions by 2030. This will be done in a variety of ways including by “accelerating decarbonization in the real economy by describing financial sector expectations of transition plans from the companies the sector engages with and finances.”

One of the largest groups of banks and financial institutions promising to make such an extreme acceleration is the Glasgow Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ). There are already “over 450 financial firms across 45 countries responsible for assets of over $130 trillion” in GFANZ including numerous large U.S. banks such as Bank of America J.P. Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo & Company.

There simply is no way for banks to keep their promises related to a transition to net-zero without imposing ESG metrics or other similar criteria on individuals and small businesses.

This report focused on revenue estimates and it looks as though the consensus view of the business has become substantially more conservative.

After the downgrade the consensus from Devon Energy's 22 analysts is for revenues of US$12b in 2022 which would reflect a discernible 6.3% decline in sales compared to the last year of performance. Per-share earnings are expected to jump 40% to US$5.86. Before this latest update the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$14b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$5.82 in 2022. Indeed we can see that the consensus opinion has undergone some fundamental changes following the recent consensus updates with a substantial drop in revenues and some minor tweaks to earnings numbers.

Check out our latest analysis for Devon Energy

The average price target was steady at US$58.10 even though revenue estimates declined; likely suggesting the analysts place a higher value on earnings. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. Currently the most bullish analyst values Devon Energy at US$70.00 per share while the most bearish prices it at US$45.00. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Devon Energy shareholders.

Another way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. Over the past five years revenues have declined around 1.6% annually. Worse forecasts are essentially predicting the decline to accelerate with the estimate for an annualised 6.3% decline in revenue until the end of 2022. Compare this against analyst estimates for companies in the broader industry which suggest that revenues (in aggregate) are expected to grow 3.5% annually. So while a broad number of companies are forecast to grow unfortunately Devon Energy is expected to see its sales affected worse than other companies in the industry.

The Bottom Line

The most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment with analysts reconfirming that earnings per share are expected to continue performing in line with their prior expectations. Unfortunately analysts also downgraded their revenue estimates and industry data suggests that Devon Energy's revenues are expected to grow slower than the wider market. Overall given the drastic downgrade to this year's forecasts we'd be feeling a little more wary of Devon Energy going forwards.

Worse Devon Energy is labouring under a substantial debt burden which - if today's forecasts prove accurate - the forecast downgrade could potentially exacerbate.

Sign up for daily news updates from CleanTechnica on email. Or follow us on Google News

We’ve recently driven our Tesla Model 3 from our daughter’s house near Charlotte North Carolina to Salt Lake City Utah. Just now we finished the last leg of our transcontinental Model 3 adventure on February 14 2022 driving from the Salt Lake City Utah area to Palm Springs in Southern California. On our multiple cross-country trips we have never had to wait for a Supercharger stall and never found a Supercharger location out of service.

However Tesla reached more than 10% of automobile sales in California in the 4th quarter of 2021 and has sold about 2 million cars globally. With the Austin Texas Gigafactory coming online to add onto the Fremont factory Tesla will soon be making cars in the US at a rate easily exceeding a million cars per year. Will the number of Tesla cars in the US overwhelm the Superchargers or is Tesla keeping up?

Encouraging signs: Most Tesla Superchargers have between 2 and 8 stalls. A couple of years ago I was amazed to read about a Las Vegas Supercharger that had 25 V3 (250 kW) stalls. However now the Supercharger at the midpoint between Salt Lakes City and Saint George Utah on I-15 at the little town of Beaver has recently increased from 8 stalls to 32 stalls with all the new stalls the V3 250 kW versions. On February 14 we stopped at the mind-blowing Supercharger in Baker California (see Figures 1 and 2) at the midpoint between Los Angles and Las Vegas on I-15. The Baker Supercharger is planned to have 96 V3 covered drive-through stalls. This station will be the second biggest in the world behind the 98 stall Supercharger at another location in California. On our return trip from Southern California to Saint George Utah on Presidents Day I actually counted the stalls at Baker and there are “only” 40 stalls in service now. One was out of order and the other 39 were full. For the very first time I had to wait a few minutes for someone to finish charging and let me hook up. According to PlugShare this is a 150 kW charger. We were sharing a charger with another car so we were only charging at a rate of 65 kW.

Since we are always traveling with one or two e-bikes on a tray-type bike rack on the back of our Model 3 the ultrasonic distance sensors on the back bumper are not functional. Therefore my wife has to get out to tell me how far to back up so that we can reach the short cable without hitting the charger. For this reason we are especially glad to see the new drive-through chargers.

The next Supercharger 100 miles further west of Baker on I-15 is the Hesperia California Supercharger station (See Fig. 3) that has 20 V3 stalls.

Unfortunately at many older Supercharger locations there are only eight 120 kW or 150 kW stalls which are shared pairs so when the stalls are mostly full you may be only charging at a maximum rate of 60 kW or slower.

Green Energy Generation on the Rise in California

Near Nipton California I saw a concentrated solar power (CSP) plant for the first time. Most commercial solar plants these days use massive fields of photovoltaic panels. However a CSP plant uses hundreds of mirrors to concentrate the heat of the sunlight on a tower containing molten salt which is then used to generate electricity. See the brilliantly illuminated tower in Figure 4.

Then as we approached Palm Spring California we were greeted by massive arrays of thousands of wind turbines some of which are shown in Figure 3. These turbines are located in a mountain pass where the wind is funneled through. Some are smaller older turbines with lattice structure towers and others are modern large mono-poll structures. Many were not turning and some had missing blades. I don’t know if the 25 mph gusty wind on February 21 was more than they could use or if it is a lack of maintenance.

Numerous Destination Chargers at the Marriott Palm Desert Villas Timeshare

We are staying with friends at a Marriott Springs Villas Palm Desert timeshare intertwined with two gorgeous 18 hole golf courses. The timeshare is in Palm Desert adjacent to Palm Springs about a hundred miles east of Los Angeles. Only 50 yards from our lodging there is a 14 stall L2 EV charging station as shown in Figure 6. We plugged in shortly after our arrival and six hours later we had a full charge to start our return trip back to Utah. Riding around the large timeshare complex on my bike I found a number of other 14 stall L2 EV charging stations. The chargers are free and as you can see there are plenty of empty stalls.

Full Self Driving (FSD) Beta — Update

We’ve now gone three full months with FSD (Beta) V10.5 and V10.8 and made our first cross-country trip with it. Read my previous articles for a full description of my FSD (Beta) experience. The good news is we have used FSD (Beta) to navigate on numerous trips with virtually no interventions and never had an accident or a close call. The system is very consistent. You quickly learn its shortcomings and know when to intervene. The greatest need for intervention comes at stop signs and rotaries. At rotaries the car will stop even when no other cars are present and then creep forward. At a stop sign the car will usually stop at the correct place but creeps forward very slowly checking for cross traffic. If you are in a hurry or there is cross traffic or someone following you it is necessary to press slightly on the accelerator when it is time to go. However the car automatically steers the turn correctly.

On the cross-country trip the FSD (Beta) navigation works the same as previously except that it no longer hands control back to you on the off-ramp. Now it drives you automatically all the way to the Supercharger.

I find that the car observes a slower moving vehicle in plenty of time and changes to the passing lane promptly except when there is a lot of traffic. Since I don’t exceed 80 mph I’m not the fastest car on the highway so I like to get out of the passing lane quickly. However FSD usually fails to do this so I need use the turn signal to force the exit from the passing lane.

Several months ago one of the over-the-air updates to FSD gave me automatic stopping at stoplights and stop signs. However at stoplights it was necessary to approve going through a green light. This was very annoying! Also if no vehicle was in front of you it was necessary to signal approval to proceed after the stop. Now with FSD (Beta) both red and green stoplights are handled properly.

FSD (Beta) V10.8 still has too much phantom braking and slowing for no apparent reason. It’s not a big problem for me since I keep my foot lightly on the accelerator and add some pressure when it occurs.

February 20 2022 I was finally given access and downloaded FSD (Beta) V10.0 using cell phone data. I will report in a future article to see if meaningful improvements have been made over the previous version.

“We’re trying to do our part to reduce the carbon footprint” said Chief Grover. “Eventually I’d like to have an all-electric fleet.”

On Saturday morning Sgt. Blake Russell who has been driving the Tesla for the last several weeks displayed the new patrol car at the ‘Finger Lakes Meetup’ in Avon.

It's estimated that after several fires and accidents only around 2000 are still in existence. Given Tesla's dramatic rise to the top of the automotive industry prices for its first production car are now soaring.

Gruber Motors an independent service and sales company that specializes in Teslas recently sold a 2008 Roadster through their portal for ""well over"" $250000. VIN013 had just 840 miles on it when listed - a staggeringly low amount for a 14-year old vehicle. This combination of low vin and low mileage resulted in such a high asking price with the owner originally accepting an offer of $250000 before receiving numerous other bids over his asking. Although he didn't want to disclose the final sale price its understood to be significantly over the original listing.

However this isn't the first exorbitantly priced Roadster on Gruber's site. Numerous other Roadsters are currently listed for over $200000. Meanwhile this 2010 Tesla Roadster in Basalt Colorado is currently asking $330000. For that money you could pre-order a second-gen Tesla Roadster and get a new Model X Plaid as well. The Electric Blue 2010 Roadster has just 592 miles - Gruber Motors says its the the ""Lowest Mileage Roadster we have ever seen"". Even crazier is VIN005. One of the original 11 Roadsters built in the UK by Lotus its for sale for $1250000.

Roadster prices vary wildly with high mileage examples now starting at around $100000. Its a far cry from a few years back when you could easily find a nice 2008 car for under $60000. When new the Roadster started at $120000 meanwhile an update for 2010 saw range boosted to over 200 miles and 0-60 mph cut to just 3.7 seconds.

As for the all-new Roadster when it will arrive remains to be seen - but Tesla CEO Elon Musk is hopeful production will begin in 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVyc2UuY29tL2lubm92YXRpb24vdGVzbGEtdG91Y2hzY3JlZW4tY29udHJvdmVyc2lhbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Your next car will look more like a Tesla in one controversial way,"When the Tesla Model S was released a decade ago it was unlike anything else on the market. And I’m not talking about the fact that it’s electric — I mean the interior design.

Franz von Holzhausen Tesla’s lead designer put an enormous 17-inch vertical touchscreen in the center of the car. It dominates the dash and you control nearly everything in the car through it — for better or worse.

“Everything that we do at Tesla has to be beautiful” said von Holzhausen in July 2017 at the launch of the Tesla Model 3. “But beauty is only great if it's functional.”

Almost 10 years after the release of the Model S the rest of the auto industry seems to be begrudgingly perhaps following von Holzhausen and Tesla down the path of the touchscreen.

The new Tesla Model S has a horizontal touchscreen rather than a vertical one used in prior models making for a better movie- or TV show-watching experience. Tesla

When Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone in 2007 he talked about the need to create a revolutionary user interface. To prove the point Jobs showed a slide of four leading “smartphones” from the day — all four had small screens and tiny keyboards. In retrospect they look just as ridiculous today as they did during Jobs’ presentation (when we didn’t even know what he was about to show off we just knew it would be far better than those other phones).

The years-long development cycle of automobiles means the car industry moves far slower than the phone biz but that helps illustrate what enormous change is happening. Almost every all-new vehicle or concept shown is jam-packed with screens accompanied by a bare handful of physical buttons required by law (hazard lights the main one).

“I don’t think anyone thought virtualized switches was something people would accept five years ago” Nichole Kraatz chief engineer of battery-electric trucks for General Motors tells Inverse. “Everyone wanted a hundred buttons everywhere.”

Now she says some manufacturers are going to full virtualization and owners either love it or hate it. She doesn’t mention a certain Texas-based EV-maker or its Twitter-loving billionaire CEO by name but it’s clear who she’s talking about.

The interior of the new 2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV revealed earlier this year at CES tries to straddle a middle between all-button and all-screen. The new electric pickup has a 17-inch horizontal touchscreen that controls most car settings but there’s also a row of dedicated climate control buttons and temperature adjustment knobs to change fan speed set the climate to Auto and turn on the front and rear defrosters.

Screens dominate the interior of the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV electric pickup but there are still two knobs and a series of buttons below to adjust the climate control. Chevrolet

There’s a limit to how far you can go with a screen says Ralph Gilles global head of design for Stellantis in an interview with Inverse. Stellantis is the new parent company of Chrysler Dodge RAM Fiat and Peugeot among others following a merger between Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot.

“Cars are starting to look like the cockpit of an Airbus A380” says Gilles. “There’s a happy medium and that sweet spot is something we’re contemplating. We want to let the interior be an interior with soft and beautiful materials.”

He raises another concern about the switch to electric vehicles: power usage. Screens consume a lot of electricity and if you’re trying to save electrons it doesn’t necessarily make sense to fill the interior with screens.

“We’re analog animals and we can only contemplate so many things at once” Gilles points out. “In our research people like a tactile interface.” But once a button is installed in a car it’s stuck there forever. Screens allow new technologies to be adopted more quickly and free up space for more storage something always in demand in a car.

“With screens we can change the function of the interior very quickly and introduce features without needing to create a button for it” Gilles says. “It’s infinitely updatable.”

The new Silverado EV leans into this idea with a customizable tray of “soft” switches that live on the screen at all times. They aren’t physical buttons but Kraatz thinks having them on the touchscreen in a predictable place at all times should be the next best thing.

“There’s plenty of space on the 17-inch screen to display everything you want” explains Kraatz. The top tray is reconfigurable and it holds buttons for things people need all the time. “If you use Tow/Haul a lot you can bring that into the persistent tray. If you use Apple Music a lot you can drag and drop that there.”

The idea is to give people what they want and make their lives easier by personalizing the vehicle but not replacing one problem with another and frustrating the user more. In the Silverado EV and other upcoming GM vehicles each vehicle driver will have a profile that customizes everything from seating position and radio presets to those persistent switches at the top of the screen.

The interior of this Chrysler Airflow concept is full of screens too. “We probably went a bit further than we needed to” admits Ralph Gilles global head of design for Stellantis Chrysler’s parent company. Chrysler

It’s not just screens that are changing how drivers and cars interact. Voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant are being increasingly integrated into new vehicles giving owners the ability to control their smart home and vehicle just by talking to them.

The Lamborghini Huracan EVO was the first car to give Alexa the ability to change climate and seat heating settings but it’s far from the last. Volvo recently integrated Google Assistant in its new cars to better connect the vehicle to owners' digital ecosystems.

“We are bringing the car as a native device into the Google Home ecosystem” says David Holecek director of digital experiences for Volvo in an interview with Inverse. “It will enable and open up a lot of new experiences as you allow for other services to interact with the car. And it’s not just about the interaction but also sharing information about vehicle status where it is and more depending on the permissions that you give to the services.”

He imagines all kinds of features can be developed based upon this connectivity not necessarily by Volvo but by other developers as well.

“This is meant to be an enabler to let others start to think about it” says Holecek. “How can we integrate [the car] with our services? Being part of this open ecosystem will spur innovation.”

Volvo says its Concept Recharge is a “manifesto” for the car’s future design language and product strategy. The interior features a large vertical touchscreen and lots of open space. Volvo

“People who use voice assistants get adjusted to them” says Thomas Stovicek head of user experience for Volvo. “For people using these systems it is a benefit and we hear that feedback. It’s a technology that’s growing.”

But like with so many things new features like these may be more easily adopted by tech-savvy youngsters. “My kids I have those [Google] speakers at home” Holecek tells me. “They ask Google Assistant what time it is instead of looking at a clock somewhere.”

The ability to anticipate the owner’s unexpressed wishes and needs will be crucial going forward especially as both homes and cars become more intelligent and more connected. “The house is alive shutting off lights or heat in a room as you move about the house” says Gilles. “It pleases the consumer in a way that is efficient but also effortless.

In other words you won’t miss those buttons so much if the car can anticipate your needs before you have them.

“When you think about it as more a home than a car we want to create an ambient experience” Gilles says. “We’re not trying to erase our legacy mindset but we want to look at it from a holistic and new way... The tech is there to do it.”

A sizeable vertical center screen fills the dash of the upcoming Ford F-150 Lightning but a handful of physical controls remain including a centrally mounted shifter. Ford

Of course this change from buttons to screens is only the beginning. The far more significant change is still to come as truly self-driving cars become a reality — and carmakers are actively thinking about what that looks like too. It used to be that autonomous car concepts had crazy things like a library or garden inside but we’re getting much closer to reality now.

Volvo is looking at ways to recommend videos or podcasts to the driver based on where you’re going traffic and how long it’ll take to get there. The company has already added YouTube to its cars and other content providers are expected to launch Android Automotive apps soon.

“Is there a way to help people relax destress and detox mentally and physically?” wonders Gilles. “Maybe it’s as simple as a game or a book on tape. As stressful as driving in a LA traffic jam can be maybe you’ll look forward to being stuck in traffic and exit that experience better than when you entered the car.”

He wants happier and healthier drivers and at the end of our chat Gilles asks himself perhaps the most crucial question of all: “How can we use this tech to help chill you out?”

Confronted with the evidence their excuse was that it was anecdotal evidence. A second brake pad missing makes that sort of argument go sour and raises concerns that more vehicles may be affected by the issue.

EV

The new case happened with Alex a Tesla Model Y Performance owner from Ontario Canada. Drive Tesla Canada broke the news showing that the website wants Tesla to succeed in the right way: without overseeing issues that the company should fix immediately.According to what Alex told Darryn John he took delivery of his Model Y Performance in Ottawa on December 28 2021. The only problem he noticed with his car was the drive side coat hook which the Tesla Service Center immediately fixed.He started to notice the issue after a few weeks. Alex reported that he began to hear a strange noise coming from the rear of his car when braking. That’s precisely what warned Gillmore of the missing part in her car. The difference is that she noticed it as soon as she drove away from the Tesla Service Center with herBy February 9 the noise was so loud that Alex decided to take the right wheel out and check the brakes there on his own. To his surprise the brake pad was missing and the brake caliper was carving the inner side of the rotor.Without all necessary parts ready for replacement the Tesla Service Center put another brake pad in the car and said Alex could drive it safely. A few days later a low brake fluid warning advised him to pull over safely. Being close to the service center he left his car there to wait for the parts and took a Model S loaner while he waited.Alex told Drive Tesla Canada he still loves the company and its cars and remains a shareholder. However he wants Tesla to take the necessary measures to avoid delivering cars without brake pads because this could have cost his life and those of his wife and kids. So do we. Hopefully Tesla will not allow a third case to pop up and will check what caused these Performance units to miss brake pads. Depending on the number of affected units a recall should follow even if for very few units."

This does not help Raspberry Pi HAT manufacturers and for instance Sequent Microsystems has made Raspberry Pi HATs over the years most models with multiple relays but also others for temperature sensors and others automation applications.

One solution would be to use compatible boards like ODROID-C4 or Rock64 but Sequent Microsystems found out the BeagleBone Black Industrial was well-stocked by various distributors and instead they designed the “Beagle-Pi Emulator” adapter to use Raspberry Pi HAT on the Texas Instruments Sitara AM3358 board.

An adapter is needed because the BeagleBone Black boards are equipped with two 46-pin headers instead of the 40-pin header on Raspberry Pi SBC’s. The expansion board routes I2C SPI four serial ports and all the GPIO’s from the 40-pin header to pins of the Beaglebone. The “Beagle-Pi Emulator” is further equipped with four mounting holes for securing it to the Beaglebone and four more to connect Raspberry Pi HAT’s. There’s also a debug connector and an LCD display connector but I’m not entirely sure this will be compatible with the official Raspberry Pi touchscreen displays.

Since the BeagleBone Black has many more I/Os all Raspberry Pi GPIO could be routed to the 40-pin header and Sequent Microsystems tested it successfully with their Raspberry Pi HATs as shown in the video below (Note: it stops at the 2:08 mark after that it’s just music…)

While the company says “All the Sequent Microsystems drivers have been compiled for Beagle Bone and can be downloaded from GitHub” I was unable to find any reference to beaglebone in their Github account. The company does not provide any software/library for GPIO conversion ither so you’d have to change the code by yourself to make it work on the BeagleBone Black. There’s good documentation for the board and both C and Python libraries are available. If your code/script uses sysfs it may work almost out of the box and you’d just need to change the pin number in the code.

The solution may not be suitable if your application requires a lot of memory processing power and/or fast interfaces as the BeagleBone Black is roughly the equivalent of the original Raspberry Pi board with Texas Instruments Sitara AM3358 single-core Cortex A8 @ 1 GHz 512 MB DDR3L 4GB eMMC flash and micro SD slot HDMI output up to 1080p30 a USB 2.0 port and Fast Ethernet (10/100M) networking.

The Beagle-Pi Emulator has just launched on Kickstarter where you can pledge $18 to get the board in April (worldwide) or $20 to get one of the 100 boards they have in stock in March (US Canada or EU only). Shipping adds $5 to the $18 pledge and $15 to the $20 pledge for expedited shipping. Looking at the current stock of BeagleBone Black (Industrial) we can see several thousand boards on Newark a few hundreds on Digikey and OKdo also has stock. More details about the Beagle-Pi emulator Raspberry Pi HAT adapter for BeagleBone Black may also be found on the product page.

With Bluetooth mesh recently gaining traction mesh networking might become even more widespread in the years to come especially in applications where thousands of IoT nodes must communicate across a geographically large area. Mesh networks can facilitate applications such as building automation energy management industrial automation and asset management.

To highlight the advantages and limitations of mesh networking this article delves into a discussion on the basic features of both star and mesh topologies. It then looks at a typical Zigbee mesh network as an example. In a future article we’ll examine Bluetooth mesh networking separately.

Choosing the Right IoT Wireless Network Solution

There are several different wireless connectivity solutions for IoT applications. Considering the wide range of use cases it can be quite challenging to choose the right wireless connectivity solution to meet the requirements of a given IoT application.

When choosing a connectivity solution various factors such as range data rate security power consumption and scalability should be considered.

Network topology—how the sensor actuator and gateway nodes are arranged or connected to each other—is another important factor that can impact network performance.

The two fundamental architectures for IoT wireless networking are the star and mesh connections.

Star Topology Advantages and Disadvantages

A star topology is depicted in Figure 1.

Figure 1. A high-level representation of a start topography. Image used courtesy of Texas Instruments

A star network consists of a central hub to which all other nodes connect. Nodes communicate with each other through the central hub which is also the gateway to the internet in most cases.

A home Wi-Fi network is a familiar star topology where phones tablets and printers all connect to a central hub (the wireless access point). This central hub acts both as a router in the local network as well as a gateway to the internet.

With the hub being responsible for distributing data packets along a star network a message can reach its destination through either a single “hop” (data transmission between a node and the hub) or two “hops” (data transmission between two nodes through the hub). This feature leads to a fast network with consistent and predictable performance.

Another advantage is that an IoT network based on star topology can easily identify and isolate a faulty node since each node has its own separate connection with the hub.

However with the data packets having to pass through the central node the network has a single point of failure. If the central node fails the whole network will cease to exist.

Another major limitation of a wireless star connection is that all nodes should be within direct radio reach of the central node. This limits the physical size of the network.

Besides a star network doesn’t have the flexibility to route around RF obstacles or environments with high RF interference.

This is not the case for mesh networks which typically incorporate multiple routing paths between every two nodes as we will discuss shortly. Mesh networks have a more flexible layout and are more likely to be able to route around RF obstacles.

Mesh Networks: Full and Partial Mesh Topology

In a mesh network one node can directly communicate with multiple other nodes.

There are two types of mesh networks: full mesh and partial mesh.

In a full mesh topology every node can directly communicate with every other node in the network.

In a partial mesh network shown in Figure 2 each node can directly connect to one or several other nodes in the network but not necessarily to every other node in the network.

Figure 2. A high-level representation of a partial network mesh. Image used courtesy of Texas Instruments

IoT applications commonly use a partial mesh topology to extend the network range as we’ll discuss below.

In a mesh network the nodes can act as a repeater routing the data through the network. As a result there are several different paths between every two nodes. This redundancy improves the network resilience; if one path fails an alternative path can be used to propagate the data through the network.

Since the nodes are capable of acting as a repeater nodes that are not within the direct radio range of each other can still communicate through the router nodes. This is a major advantage of mesh networking in IoT applications because it allows a user to extend the range of the network beyond that of a single radio.

The downside is that the multi-hop nature of the communications can increase the delay of propagating a data packet across the network.

The hop counts and consequently the network latency is a function of the number of routers the data packet passes through. This makes evaluating network performance more complicated than a simple structure such as the star topology discussed above.

In this case one might use a quality of service (QoS) metric: the ratio of transmitted packets that reach the end destination within a specified time duration (say 300ms).

The routing nodes of a mesh network should implement some routing algorithms to efficiently deliver the packets to destinations. To implement these routing functions the routing nodes should have more processing power and memory which increases the complexity and cost of these nodes.

Zigbee Protocol for Star Tree and Mesh Topologies

Zigbee is an open global standard designed to meet the needs of low-cost low-power wireless IoT networks.

Zigbee is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 link layer and operates in unlicensed bands including 2.4 GHz 900 MHz and 868 MHz. ZigBee supports star tree and mesh topologies.

A typical Zigbee mesh network is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3. An example of a Zigbee mesh network. Image used courtesy of S.M. Song W.J. Yao

The radios in a Zigbee mesh network play different roles. A node can be a coordinator router or end device. The coordinator sets up the network and allows routers and end devices to join the network. In addition to creating the network the coordinator is also responsible for managing the security of the network.

The router nodes are always listening to route the information they receive through the network. These nodes are commonly mains powered.

Finally end devices are nodes that don't route the information. These devices remain in a sleep mode to save power and wake up only briefly to poll their parents and pick up the messages that have been sent to them.

End devices are commonly battery-powered nodes.

A Zigbee mesh network can configure itself automatically (self-forming).

Also when a node leaves the network or fails the network can reconfigure routing paths based on the new combination of the nodes. This self-healing feature increases the stability of the network in changing conditions.

In the next article in this series we’ll examine different features of Bluetooth mesh networks that have recently attracted a lot of attention from the IoT industry.

Three independent sample sets were used in this study. The first set comprising samples from 370 patients with SCZ (mean (±SD) age = 49.73 ± 14.75 years; males = 52.97%) and 192 patients with ASD (mean age = 16.34 ± 8.36 years; males = 77.60%) was sequenced for rare point mutations. The second larger set comprising samples from 1871 patients with SCZ (mean age = 48.59 ± 14.12 years; males = 51.84%) 380 patients with ASD (mean age = 18.97 ± 9.89 years; males = 78.48%) and 1916 controls (mean age = 44.95 ± 15.16 years; males = 52.07%) was used for association analysis of selected variants detected in the first set. For further analysis of variants detected in the first and second set we included an independent sample set composed of 2398 patients with SCZ (mean age = 52.06 ± 13.63 years; males = 58.55%) and 3679 controls (mean age = 40.60 ± 13.42 years; males = 39.14%).

All participants in this study were recruited in the Nagoya University Hospital and its associated Institutes. Patients were included in the study if they met DSM-5 criteria for SCZ or ASD and were physically healthy. Healthy controls were selected from the general population and had no personal or family history of psychiatric disorders (first-degree relatives only based on an interview with the subject). Selection was based on the following: questionnaire responses from the subjects themselves during the sample inclusion step or an unstructured diagnostic interview conducted by an experienced psychiatrist during the blood collection step. All subjects were unrelated lived in the central area of the Honshu island of Japan and self-identified as members of the Japanese population. The Ethics Committees of the Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine and Research Institute of Environmental Medicine approved this study. All experiments were performed in accordance with the Committee’s guidelines and regulations. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. In addition each patient’s capacity to provide consent was confirmed by a family member when needed. Individuals with a legal measure of reduced capacity were excluded.

Resequencing and data analysis

Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood or saliva using the QIAGEN QIAamp DNA blood kit or tissue kit (QIAGEN Hilden Germany). Custom amplification primers were designed using Ion AmpliSeq Designer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham MA USA) to cover coding exons and flanking intron regions of the selected genes. Sample amplification and equalization were achieved using Ion AmpliSeq Library Kits 2.0 and the Ion Library Equalizer Kit respectively (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Amplified sequences were ligated with Ion Xpress Barcode Adapters (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Emulsion PCR and subsequent enrichment were performed using the Ion OneTouch Template Kit v2.0 on Ion OneTouch 2 and Ion OneTouch ES respectively (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The final product then was sequenced on the Ion PGM sequencing platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Raw data output from the sequencer was deposited in the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) (http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp) under Accession Number DRA004490 and uploaded to the Torrent Server (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for variant calling with NCBI GRCh37 as a reference. The resulting VCF (variant call format) files were analyzed by Ingenuity Variant Analysis (QIAGEN) for annotation and visualization. Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (http://cadd.gs.washington.edu/) was applied for annotation of genetic variants.

Prioritization and association analysis

Missense mutations small insertions/deletions and splicing site variations with a minor allele frequency <1% were selected from the annotated data. The mutation calls then were validated for confidence by Sanger sequencing using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Genotyping prioritization was based on whether the mutation was 1) located in a functional domain or motif of the protein according to the Human Protein Reference Database (http://www.hprd.org) Pfam (http://pfam.xfam.org/) and existing literature or functionally important such as causing a frame shift stop gain or cysteine gain/loss; 2) a rare variant with a minor allele frequency <1% or novel or registered in the NCBI dbSNP database (Build 137) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/) the 1000 Genomes Project (http://www.1000genomes.org/) the Exome Variant Server of NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP6500SI-V2) (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/) the Human Genetic Variation Database of Japanese genetic variation consortium (http://www.genome.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/SnpDB) or the Integrative Japanese Genome Variation database (https://ijgvd.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/); and 3) predicted to represent a nonsynonymous deleterious mutation by at least one of five in silico algorithms (PolyPhen2 HumDiv and HumVar [30] LRT [31] MutationTaster [32] and SIFT [33]). Additional in silico analysis including conservation status was performed for the prioritized SNVs using HomoloGene (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/homologene).

Custom TaqMan SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) genotyping assays were designed and ordered from Applied Biosystems. Allelic discrimination analysis was performed on an ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Allele and genotype frequencies of the mutations were compared between patients with SCZ and controls or between patients with ASD and controls using Fisher’s exact test (two-tailed) with a threshold of significance set at p < 0.05.

Identification of de novo SNVs

We examined the inheritance pattern of the prioritized SNVs if parental samples were available. For cases with de novo SNVs we performed paternity testing using an Identifiler plus kit for 15 short tandem repeats (AmpFlSTR Identifiler plus kit Thermo Fisher Scientific) and each parental genotype was consistent with each of their child’s genotypes. The amplicons were loaded using an ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and genotyped automatically using GeneMapper ID v3.2 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The probabilities for calculated paternity supported the conclusion that parental samples were collected from the proband’s biological parents. Among parents of cases with de novo SNVs all were psychiatrically healthy based on self-reporting or questionnaire responses.

Plasmid construction and mutagenesis

Human brain and human cerebral cortex total RNA (Takara Bio Kusatsu Japan) or human heart total RNA (Takara Bio) was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Human CACNA1C isoforms were amplified by PCR using Platinum SuperFi DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the following primer pairs: the short and neuronal CACNA1C isoform was amplified using forward CTCGAGCTCAAGCTTGCCACCATGCTTCGAGCCTTTGTTCAG and reverse CGGGCCGGTACCCTACAGGCTGCTGACGTAGA; the long and cardiac CACNA1C isoform was amplified using forward CTCGAGCTCAAGCTTGCCACCATGCTTCGAGCCTTTGTTCAG and reverse CGGGCCGGTACCCTACAGGCTGCTGACGTAGACCCT. The resulting PCR fragment was inserted into a pCAG vector [34]. The clones prepared from human brain and cerebral cortex total RNA were identified as CACNA1C isoform 14 in the RefSeq database (NM_001129840.1) and used as neuronal (exon 1-containing short) isoform in this study. The clones from human heart total RNA were identified as CACNA1C isoform X30 (XM_006719017.2) and used as cardiac (exon 1a-containing long) isoform in this study. We introduced the point mutation corresponding to p.A36V into the wild-type (WT) CACNA1C by the megaprimer method [35]. The first PCR was performed with the aforementioned forward primer used for CACNA1C cloning and a reverse primer (GGGCCAGCCCCACTGCCGCATTG) containing the mutation corresponding to p.A36V. The second PCR was performed with the first PCR product (megaprimer) and the reverse primer used for CACNA1C cloning and the resulting PCR product was inserted into the pCAG vector. Following construction the identities of plasmid inserts were confirmed by sequencing.

Immunoblotting

For immunoblotting experiments HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM; Nacalai Tesque Kyoto Japan) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Merck Darmstadt Germany) and Penicillin-Streptomycin Mixed Solution (Nacalai Tesque) under 5% CO 2 in air at 37 °C. Cells were transfected in 35-mm tissue culture dishes (IWAKI Kawajiri Japan) with 1 µg of the pCAG-CACNA1C-WT-IRES-EGFP (WT-Ca v 1.2) or pCAG-CACNA1C-A36V-IRES-EGFP (A36V-Ca v 1.2) plasmids using X-tremeGENE 9 DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche Basel Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Immunoblotting experiments were performed at 28 hours after transfection.

Transfected HEK293T cells were collected with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and sonicated in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 150 mM NaCl 0.5% sodium deoxycholate 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) 1% NP-40) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Nacalai Tesque). After centrifugation for 5 min at 15000 × g the supernatant was collected and combined with 6× Sample buffer (Nacalai Tesque); the mixture then was denatured at 90 °C (for immunoblotting of β-actin) or at room temperature (for immunoblotting of Ca v 1.2). The extracted proteins were separated on 12% (β-actin) or 6% (Ca v 1.2) SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Merck). The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk (Nacalai Tesque) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBS-T) incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 2.5% skim milk in TBS-T overnight and washed with TBS-T. The primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare Piscataway NJ US). Images were captured using a ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad Hercules CA USA). The antibodies used for immunoblotting were purchased commercially as follows: a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Ca v 1.2 (ACC-003 Alomone Labs Jerusalem Israel) a mouse monoclonal antibody against β-actin (A5441 Merck) and secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP (ab97051 and ab97023 abcam Cambridge UK).

Immunocytochemistry

For immunocytochemistry Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) cells were cultured in 24-well plastic tissue culture plates (IWAKI) containing 12 mm circular cover glasses (Glaswarenfabrik Karl Hecht Sondheim vor der Rhön Germany) coated with poly-L-lysine (Merck); cells were cultured in DMEM (Nacalai Tesque) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated FBS and Penicillin-Streptomycin Mixed Solution under 5% CO 2 in air at 37 °C. Cells were transfected in 24-well plastic tissue culture plates (IWAKI) with 0.2 µg pCAG-α 2 δ-P2A-β 3 -T2A-mCherry-KRasCT [34] and 0.05 µg pCAG-CACNA1C-WT or pCAG-CACNA1C-A36V plasmids using X-tremeGENE 9 DNA Transfection Reagent. After 24 hours transfected cells were fixed for 15 min with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde permeabilized for 10 min with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and incubated for 60 min with 5% normal goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS to block nonspecific antibody binding. After pretreatment cells were incubated overnight with rabbit polyclonal anti-Ca v 1.2 antibody (1:1000 Alomone Labs) in blocking solution and then stained for 1 hour with an AlexaFluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG goat antibody (1:1000 Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS. All images were captured with a LSM 710 confocal microscope (Cael Zeiss Microscopy Jena Germany) equipped with a 20×/0.8 numerical aperture (NA) objective. To evaluate Ca v 1.2 trafficking to the plasma membrane we defined the regions of interest (ROIs) of the plasma membrane based on membrane-tethering red fluorescent protein (RFP-KRasCT) images using an intensity threshold. Cytoplasmic ROIs were defined as inside regions of the plasma membrane ROIs excluding nucleus regions. After background subtraction mean Ca v 1.2 intensity from each ROI was used to calculate Ca v 1.2 intensity ratio (membrane/cytoplasm). Statistical comparison between WT and A36V mutant channels was performed by two-tailed Welch’s t test.

Modeling of the 3D structure of the Ca v 1.2 calcium channel and its N-terminus

We performed homology modeling of Ca v 1.2 using three-dimensional (3D) structures homologous to Ca v 1.2 as obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB; version 2021/11/17) using PSI-BLAST [36] with the help of the HOMCOS server [37]. We focused here on three structures: the rabbit Ca v 1.1 channel (PDB ID:5gjw; 78% protein sequence identity to Ca v 1.2) [38] the cockroach Na v channel (PDB ID:6a95; 32% protein sequence identity to Ca v 1.2) [39] and a complex of CaM and the N-terminal spatial Ca2+-transforming element (NSCaTE)region of Ca v 1.2 (PDB ID: 2lqc; 100% protein sequence identity to Ca v 1.2) [40]. Individual homologous template 3D structures are shown in Fig. S3 and the overall aligned regions are shown graphically in Fig. S1. Because the most similar structure (5gjw) does not cover the mutated residue 36 we employed a chimeric template. We observed that the conformations of these structures were inconsistent in the N-terminal region; notably the conformation of the NSCaTE region is α-helical in 2lqc but assumes a β-sheet-like structure in 6a95 (see Figs. S2 and S3). Given that the N-terminal region (amino acids 1-89) was predicted to form an intrinsically disordered region using DISOPRED 3.16 [41] we hypothesized that the N-terminal region might be able to assume several different conformations and therefore decided to build models of two different structures: a folded N-terminal structure and a CaM-binding structure. The template of the folded N-terminal structure was generated by combining the structure 5gjw and the N-terminal structure of 6a95 (Figs. S1 S3b). The template of the CaM-binding structure also was generated by combining the structure 5gjw and the N-terminal structure of 6a95 but in this case the NSCaTE region (47-68) was taken from 2lqc chain B (Figs. S1 S3c). The combination of several structures was performed using MATRAS [42] and an in-house Python script. Using the two hybrid template structures we successfully built two distinct models of Ca v 1.2 using MODELLER 10.2 [43]. To refine the 3D structure of the model we repeated short molecular dynamics simulations of N-terminal domain (31-111 residues) of the 3D model using AMBER 20 [44] to generate 10 final structures and chose one representative from these ten structures (Fig. S4). Details of the modeling are described in Supplementary information. The model of the folded N-terminal structure is shown in Fig. 2a and that of the CaM-binding structure is shown in Fig. 2b.

Electrophysiology

For electrophysiology BHK cells stably expressing α 2 δ and β 2 subunits (BHK-α 2 δ + β 2 ) described previously [45] were used. BHK-α 2 δ + β 2 cells were cultured in DMEM (Merck) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 30 unit/mL penicillin (Meiji Seika Pharma Tokyo Japan) and 30 μg/mL streptomycin (Meiji Seika Pharma) under 5% CO 2 in air at 37 °C. BHK-α 2 δ + β 2 cells were seeded into Primaria™ 60-mm cell culture dishes (Corning Glendale AZ USA) and grown to 80–90% confluence. The BHK-α 2 δ + β 2 cells were used between passages 2 and 10. DNA electroporation was performed with a MicroPorator MP-100 (NanoEnTek Seoul South Korea) with 10-μL tips according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. For each electroporation 1 × 105 BHK-α 2 δ + β 2 cells were suspended in Buffer R and mixed with 0.5 μg WT- or A36V-CACNA1C plasmid and 0.08 μg EGFP-N1 (Takara Bio) vector as the marker for the transfected cells. The electroporation settings were 1150 V 20 ms and 2 pulses. Following electroporation the cells were transferred into Primaria™ 35-mm cell culture dishes (Corning). Electrophysiological experiments were performed at 3–5 days after electroporation.

Currents were recorded using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques [46] with an EPC-10 patch-clamp amplifier (HEKA Elektronik Reutlingen Germany) at room temperature. Patch pipettes were made from borosilicate glass capillaries (outer diameter 1.5 mm; Hilgenberg Malsfeld Germany) using a Model P-87 Flaming-Brown micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Novato CA USA). Pipette resistance ranged from 2 to 3.5 Mohm when filled with the pipette solution described below. The series resistance was electronically compensated to 60% and both the leakage and the remaining capacitance were subtracted by -P/5 method. Currents were sampled at 20 kHz after low-pass filtering at 2.9 kHz. The pipette solution contained the following components (in mM concentrations): Cs-aspartate 95 CsCl 40 MgCl 2 4 ATP-Na 2 2 phosphocreatine-Na 2 10 EGTA 5 and HEPES 5 and was adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH. The pipette solution for Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI) recording contained (in mM concentrations): Cs-methanesulfonate 130 CsCl 5 MgCl 2 5 ATP-Na 2 2 phosphocreatine-Na 2 5 EGTA 0.5 and HEPES 10 and was adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH. The ‘10 mM Ba2+’ external solution contained the following components (in mM concentrations): tetraethylammonium (TEA) -Cl 140 BaCl 2 10 glucose 10 and HEPES 10 and was adjusted to pH 7.4 with TEA-OH. The ‘10 mM Ca2+’ external solution contained the following components (in mM concentrations): TEA-Cl 140 CaCl 2 10 glucose 10 and HEPES 10 and was adjusted to pH 7.4 with TEA-OH. Osmolarity of all solutions was approximately 300 mOsm. Rapid exchange of the external solutions surrounding the cell was provided within 1 sec by a modified ‘Y-tube’ method [47].",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNDE5LTAyMi0wNDYyMy0w0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CircCYP24A1 hampered malignant phenotype of renal cancer carcinoma through modulating CMTM-4 expression via ...,"Decreased expression of hsa_circ_0060927 (circCYP24A1) is observed in RCC and correlates with an unfavorable prognosis

High-throughput sequencing was performed to discover the differential expression of circRNAs in 2 pairs of fresh RCC and peritumor normal tissues. Twelve circRNAs were upregulated while 19 circRNAs were downregulated in RCC tissues compared with normal tissues according to our analysis of the sequencing data (Fig. 1A). Among the 19 decreased circRNAs in RCC hsa_circ_0060927 (circCYP24A1) was one of the most substantially downregulated circRNAs and was derived from the CYP24A1 gene located on chr20:52771300–52773707 (Fig. 1B). Moreover the RCC tumor cell lines 786-O 769-P Caki-1 and A498 expressed circCYP24A1 at lower levels than the normal cell line HK-2 (Fig. 1C) consistent with our findings from clinical tumor samples. circCYP24A1 showed more resistance to RNase R than linear CYP24A1 in 786-O and A498 cell lines (Fig. 1D). In addition the circRNA form of CYP24A1 showed relatively higher stability than its linear form after actinomycin-D treatment (Fig. 1E). CircCYP24A1 expression was then assessed in the RCC TMA of 82 patients who underwent nephrectomy (Fig. 1F). We found that the RCC tumor tissue expressed a decreased level of circCYP24A1 compared with the peritumor normal tissue (Fig. 1G). K–M analysis revealed that patients with RCC presenting low circCYP24A1 expression experienced shorter overall survival (Fig. 1H) and a higher tumor burden and tumor grades (Table 1). Overall the lack of circCYP24A1 in RCC was associated with worse clinical outcomes indicating its crucial role in tumorigenesis.

Fig. 1: The circRNA circCYP24A1 is downregulated in RCC and associated with a favorable prognosis for patients with RCC. A The differential expression analysis showed that circRNAs were differentially expressed in RCC tumor and normal tissues (P < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1.5). Notably hsa_circ_0060927 was identified as the most highly differentially expressed circRNA. B The location and illustration of hsa_circ_0060927 (circCYP24A1). C Relative expression of circCYP24A1 in the RCC cell lines 786-O 769-P Caki-1 and A498 was evaluated and compared with the normal kidney proximal tubular cell line HK-2 using qRT-PCR. D qRT-PCR was performed to measure the relative expression of CYP24A1 and circCYP24A1 in 786-O and A498 cell lines treated with RNase R or vehicle control. E Relative expression of circular and linear CYP24A1 in 786-O and A498 cells incubated with actinomycin. F G In situ hybridization was performed to assess the expression of circCYP24A1 in tumor and normal tissues from patients with RCC.

Overexpression of circCYP24A1 inhibits the proliferation invasion and migration of RCC cells

Next we evaluated whether circCYP24A1 regulated the tumorigenesis of RCC. A lentivirus vector for circCYP24A1 overexpression (LV-circCYP24A1) was constructed. We confirmed the elevated expression of circCYP24A1 in 786-O and A498 cell lines transfected with LV-circCYP24A1 (Fig. 2A). These two cell lines with circCYP24A1 overexpression showed significantly reduced proliferation in CCK-8 assays (Fig. 2B). The cell cycle analysis revealed an increased proportion of RCC cells transfected with LV-circCYP24A1 in S phase but a decreased proportion in G0/G1 phase (Fig. 2C Supplementary Fig. 1A). Moreover more apoptotic RCC cells were detected after circCYP24A1 overexpression indicating that circCYP24A1 promoted the apoptosis of RCC (Fig. 2D Supplementary Fig. 1B). Transwell assays (Fig. 2E Supplementary Fig. 1C) and wound-healing assays (Fig. 2F Supplementary Fig. 1D) showed that RCC cells overexpressing circCYP24A1 exhibited relatively low invasion and migration levels. Additionally tumor cells transfected with LV-circCYP24A1 showed lower proliferation rates than the control cells (Fig. 2G Supplementary Fig. 1E). Based on these results circCYP24A1 overexpression suppressed the proliferation invasion and migration of RCC cells.

Fig. 2: Overexpression of circCYP24A1 inhibits the tumorigenesis of RCC cells in vitro. A Relative expression of circCYP24A1 was evaluated using qRT-PCR in 786-O and A498 cell lines transfected with LV-NC or LV-circCYP24A1. B Relative proliferation rates were evaluated in 786-O and A498 cell lines transfected with LV-NC or LV-circCYP24A1.

CircCYP24A1 functions as a sponge for miR-421

CircRNAs are known to influence the expression of downstream mRNAs by functioning as miRNA sponges [14]. Thus we explored the targets of circCYP24A1 to further elucidate its effect on tumor progression by examining four online prediction databases including circBank Encori CircInteractome and MiRanda (Fig. 3A). Two miRNAs (miR-1276 and miR-421) were selected after screening (Fig. 3A B). A strong interaction was identified between circCYP24A1 and miR-421 but not miR-1276 using RNA-pulldown assays (Fig. 3C). Ago2 RNA immunoprecipitation validated that circCYP24A1 and miR-421 bound to Ago2 to form an Ago2-regulated complex (Fig. 3D). The colocalization of circCYP24A1 and miR-421 was also observed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3E) suggesting that miR-421 was the binding target of circCYP24A1. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed and showed that transfection of miR-421 mimics decreased the luciferase activity of wild-type circCYP24A1 (Fig. 3F) while miR-421 mimics failed to reduce the luciferase activity of mutant circCYP24-A1 (Fig. 3G). Thus we suggested that circCYP24 A1 served as an miR-421 sponge in RCC cells.

Fig. 3: CircCYP24A1 functions as a sponge for miR-421 in RCC cells. A The miRNAs that potentially interact with circCYP24A1 were screened using four databases: CircBank Encori CircInteractome and MiRanda. B Screening of the four databases identified miR-421 and miR-1276 as two possible targets of circCYP24A1. C Relative expression of miR-421 and miR-1276 was measured using qRT-PCR after RNA pulldown with the circCYP24A1 probe or the control probe in 786-O cells. D Ago2 RIP was performed to detect the precipitation of circCYP24A1 and miR-421. E CircCYP24A1 and miR-421 were detected by FISH in 786-O and A498 cells. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. The bar corresponds to 20 μm. F Mutant and wild-type circCYP24A1 sequences were constructed for the dual-luciferase reporter assay. G Relative luciferase activity was measured in 786-O cells transfected with miR-421 mimics or normal control along with mutant or wild-type circCYP24A1.

CMTM4 is the target of miR-421 in RCC and correlates with favorable clinical outcomes

Four databases TargetScan Encori miRWalk and TCGA-KIRC were analyzed for cross-matching to identify the potential targets of miR-421 in RCC cells (Fig. 4A). Four potential targets (THRB PFKB2 CMTM4 and PAPPA) were identified but only CMTM4 expression increased with the overexpression of circCYP24A1 (Fig. 4B) indicating that CMTM4 was the target of miR-421 in RCC cells. CMTM4 expression decreased in RCC tumors compared with normal tissues in TCGA-KIRC database (Fig. 4C). Moreover patients with RCC presenting high CMTM4 expression exhibited longer overall survival and disease-free survival than patients with low CMTM4 expression (Fig. 4D E). Gene-set enrichment analysis showed that CMTM4 expression was negatively associated with the MAPK signaling pathway suggesting that CMTM4 may regulate this pathway to suppress tumor progression. Dual-luciferase reporter vectors for wild-type and mutant CMTM4 were constructed to further confirm the effect of miR-421 on CMTM4 expression (Fig. 4G Supplementary Fig. 1F). After the transfection of miR-421 mimics and miR-421 inhibitor CMTM4 expression decreased in RCC cells from the miR-mimic transfection group and increased in the miR-inhibitor-treated group (Fig. 4H) indicating that CMTM4 served as the direct target of miR-421.

Fig. 4: CMTM4 is the target of miR-421 in RCC. A The possible targets of miR-421 were predicted by four databases including TargetScan Encori miRWalk and KIRC Down. KIRC Down represents the downregulated genes in the differential gene expression analysis of TCGA-KIRC database. B Relative expression of THRB PFKFB2 CMTM4 and PAPPA was measured using qRT-PCR in 786-O cells transfected with LV-NC or LV-circCYP24A1. C CMTM4 TPM expression in the tumor tissues compared with the normal tissues in TCGA-KIRC database. Overall survival (D) and disease-free survival (E) were measured using the Kaplan–Meier analysis. F Gene-set enrichment analysis of the MAPK signaling pathway in patients from TCGA-KIRC with high/low CMTM4 expression. G The predicted binding site for circCYP24A1 and miR-421 is illustrated. Mutant and wild-type CMTM4 constructs for dual-luciferase reporter assays were generated. H CMTM4 expression was detected using Western blotting in 786-O and A498 cells transfected with miR-421 mimic miR-421 inhibitor or its normal control. Data are presented as means ± SD. ***p < 0.001.

Overexpression of miR-421 and silencing of CMTM4 reverse the suppression of the malignant phenotype induced by circCYP24A1 overexpression

The association between the circCYP24A1/miR-421/CMTM4 pathway and tumor progression was further explored. Levels of proteins involved in EMT signaling (N-cadherin) MEK–ERK signaling (p-ERK) and AKT/mTOR signaling (p-AKT) were detected in 786-O and A498 cells transfected with the circCYP24A1-overexpression construct miR-421 mimics or sh-CMTM4 using Western blotting. Notably circCYP24A1 overexpression significantly abrogated RCC malignant phenotype-related pathways and proliferation while miR-421 overexpression and CMTM4 silencing rescued these changes (Fig. 5A B). Colony-formation assays (Fig. 5C and D) and Transwell assays (Fig. 5E and F) further showed that miR-421 overexpression and CMTM4 silencing promoted tumor proliferation and invasion after circCYP24A1 overexpression. Consistent with the aforementioned results wound-healing assays also revealed increased migration of RCC cells cotransfected with LV-circCYP24A1 and miR-421 mimics or sh-CMTM4 (Fig. 5G H). In conclusion overexpression of miR-421 and silencing of CMTM4 reversed tumor suppression induced by circCYP24A1 expression.

MiR-421 promotes RCC tumor progression by inhibiting CMTM4

The oncogenic function of miR-421 through CMTM4 inhibition was further explored. 786-O and A498 cell lines were treated with miR-412 inhibitor or inhibitor plus sh-CMTM4. EMT signaling MEK/ERK signaling AKT/mTOR signaling and proliferation were constrained in cells transfected with the miR-412 inhibitor but activated in cells transfected with the inhibitor plus sh-CMTM4 (Fig. 6A B). Moreover colony-formation assays (Fig. 6C D) and Transwell assays (Fig. 6E F) indicated the tumor-suppression capacity of the miR-421 inhibitor while this effect was diminished with the addition of sh-CMTM4. The migration of 786-O and A498 cells was also suppressed by the miR-421 inhibitor while the effect was abolished by the addition of sh-CMTM4 (Fig. 6G H).

Fig. 6: Inhibition of miR-421 suppresses the proliferation invasion and migration of RCC cells in vitro which were reversed by silencing CMTM4. The levels of N-cadherin (EMT signaling pathway) p-ERK (MEK/ERK pathway) and p-AKT (AKT/mTOR pathway) were evaluated using Western blotting and the relative proliferation rate of 786-O (A) and A498 (B) cells transfected with LV-NC miR-421 inhibitor and miR-421 inhibitor+sh-CMTM4 was measured. Colony-formation assays (C D) transwell assays (E F) and wound-healing assays (G H) were performed and quantitatively analyzed in 786-O cells transfected with LV-NC miR-421 inhibitor and miR-421 inhibitor plus sh-CMTM4.

Overexpression of circCYP24A1 leads to tumor suppression in vivo but the changes are reversed after miR-421 overexpression or CMTM4 silencing

We further validated the role of the circCYP24A1/miR-421/CMTM4 axis in RCC in vivo. 786-O-luc cells transfected with LV-NC LV-circCYP24A1 LV-circCYP24A1 plus miR-421 mimic and LV-circCYP24A1 plus sh-CMTM4 were subcutaneously injected into nude mice and tumor growth was evaluated (Fig. 7A). Overexpression of circCYP24A1 significantly suppressed tumor growth in vivo and was reversed by the addition of miR-421 inhibitor or sh-CMTM4 (Fig. 7B–D). Consistent with our previous findings N-cadherin (EMT marker) p-ERK (MEK/ERK signaling marker) and p-AKT (AKT/mTOR signaling marker) levels were reduced in tumors with circCYP24A1 overexpression and restored by the addition of miR-421 inhibitor or sh-CMTM4 (Fig. 7E). Therefore circCYP24A1 overexpression inhibited tumor progression in vivo through the miR-421/CMTM4 pathway.

Fig. 7: Overexpression of circCYP24A1 suppresses RCC progression in vivo. Luciferase-expressing 786-O cells transfected with LV-NC LV-circCYP24A1 LV-cirCYP24A1+miR-421 mimic and LV-circCYP24A1+sh-CMTM4 were used to establish subcutaneous xenograft models (N = 5). A Tumor growth was monitored using in vivo bioluminescence imaging. B Weights of subcutaneous 786-O tumors were evaluated 21 days after implantation. C Relative luciferase values of subcutaneous 786-O tumors were assessed. D Subcutaneous 786-O tumors are shown. E Immunohistochemical staining for CMTM4 N-cadherin p-ERK and p-AKT was performed in the subcutaneous tumors from the 4 groups. Full size image

circCYP24A1 overexpression in RCC cells leads to reduced lung metastasis

As RCC shows a relatively high metastasis rate we further explored whether circCYP24A1 overexpression correlates with the metastatic ability of RCC cells. 786-O-luc cells transfected with LV-NC LV-circCYP24A1 LV-circCYP24A1 plus miR-421 mimic and LV-circCYP24A1 plus sh-CMTM4 were injected into the tail vein of nude mice to explore the lung metastasis ability of RCC cells. Bioluminescence imaging showed a decreased number of metastatic lesions in mice with circCYP24A1 overexpression but an increased number in mice with miR-421 overexpression or CMTM4 knockdown (Fig. 8A B). The visible metastatic lesions in the lungs were assessed and showed a reduction in the circCYP24A1-overexpression group. The metastatic lesions in mice treated with LV-circCYP24A1 plus miR-421 mimic and LV-circCYP24A1 plus sh-CMTM4 were also decreased compared with those of the control mice (Fig. 8C D). Thus we suggested that circCYP24A1 overexpression suppressed tumor metastasis in vivo by regulating the circCYP24A1/miR-421/CMTM4 network in RCC (Fig. 8E).",,,,,,,,,

Davis

Special to Akron Beacon Journal

The village of Navarre in Stark County is a jewel that has been hidden for a long time but is starting to sparkle again. The journey has been trying at times but there are signs that new life downtown and new commercial and industrial development are taking place.

Location

Navarre is located on the banks of the Tuscarawas River in southwest Stark County just south of Massillon and 8 miles southwest of Canton. Although the village is situated within a 1.82-square-mile area U.S. 62 and state Route 21 run through Navarre. In addition to Massillon and the village of Brewster Navarre is bordered by Perry Tuscarawas and Sugarcreek townships plus the community of Justus where the Fairless Local Schools campus is situated.

History

Initially Navarre was established in 1834 as one of three small communities including Bethlehem and Rochester. In 1872 all merged becoming the village of Navarre. The first mayor of Navarre was Jacob Mentzer from 1872 until 1876. Current Mayor Robert L. Benson was elected the village’s 30th mayor in 1995 and is in his 27th consecutive year at the village helm. He said he plans to retire at the end of 2023 when his current term ends but the few willing to comment said the mayor has made that declaration the last year of each four-year term. Benson says his phrase is etched in his brain. “I’ll be 79 then and that’s enough.”

The village has several structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places including the J.D. Define building at the corner of Canal and Market streets. Built in 1842 by John Lowe the structure was a former grocery store where youngsters bought their penny candy. Historians say the building was also where President William McKinley filed his first lawsuit.

The Mathews House Museum was built in 1836 at 123 High St. NW and was the boyhood home of artists Alfred and William Mathews. The museum promotes research and public education.

The Stahl-Hoagland House at 330 Wooster St. NW was built in 1834 adjacent to the Ohio & Erie Canal’s entrance to the village. The house is listed as a private location and not open for tours.

Among the oldest structures still viable is the Manely Antique Mill at 9 Canal St. W. Built in 1850 as a 6000-square-foot single-family home its current proprietor is Tom Manely who established his antique shop in 1950. He said Surbey Feed and Supply had occupied the space for some 60 years. Now the multifloor facility is jammed full of almost everything imaginable that collectors and the curious dream about. The store is open from noon to 5 p.m. Thursday and Friday and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.

Other longtime businesses downtown include Nickles Bakery Mid’s Sauces Billy Jacobs Art Gallery Massillon Container and the Rochester Historic District where Kraus’ Pizza and recent newcomer Knotted Up Quilt Shop are located side by side on Center Street. The Navarre-Bethlehem Township Historical Society at 123 High St. was founded in 1972 to preserve the history of both communities.

Highlights

Mayor Benson said he and a team of community leaders have been working over 30 years to bolster and preserve Navarre’s future. “We now have our Prospect Industrial Park (formerly the 327-acre Stark County Farm) through collaboration with the Stark Board of Trade and several private foundations” noted Benson who served 10 years on Village Council before his election as mayor in 1995.

Two major businesses – Hendrickson and Tractor Supply Co. – already are committed to the Industrial park where there is enough room for three more commercial or industrial businesses on the remaining 173 acres said Benson a Fairless High School graduate and U.S. Navy veteran who retired from AT&T in 2011 after 42 years.

Mark Slingluff director of global branding and communications at Hendrickson explained the plant is under Hendrickson’s Trailer Commercial Vehicle Systems division. The $50 million plant is Hendrickson’s sixth trailer suspension plant. The state-of-the-art facility will manufacture axles and suspensions for heavy-duty Class 8 vehicles.

Eric Bauer director of operations of Trailer Commercial Vehicle Systems in Canton said the Navarre plant and offices known as Hendrickson Navarre opened a year ago and have 280 hourly and salary workers already on the job. When the facility reaches capacity there will be 320 associates. The firm occupies 35 acres and has 183000 square feet for manufacturing and 21000 square feet for offices.

Tractor Supply Co. which offers a wide supply of agricultural pet and livestock supplies plus tools work wear and boots already has an 898000-square-foot distribution center under construction on 117 acres of the industrial park. Tractor Supply's Mary Wynn Pilkington senior vice president of investment and public relations said the investment is north of $70 million and will create 375 new full-time jobs. Completion is targeted for sometime this fall.

Other businesses have come to the city within the last few years while new businesses are still springing up according to Benson. Among those “newcomers” are the Main Street Deli at 531 Main St. N; ’77 Brew House at 21 Canal St. W.; Yoga On Tilt Healing Tree Crystals and Building on Main Street at 103 N. Main St.; and J and J Optical at 1 N. Main.

Partners Marshall Boivin and Clint McIntyre are hoping their ’77 Brew House will be open to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day (March 17) with hours yet to be named. Their usual hours once opened will be 4 to 10 p.m. Thursday and Friday and noon to 11 p.m. Saturdays.

Boivin said Navarre’s first brewery closed in 1876 and no brewery has come since 1877. “Since we both were born in 1977 the number 77 kept popping up; we decided to name our place ’77 Brew House as the village’s second brew house in Navarre’s history.”

Yoga on Tilt owner Mandy Roma opened her business in the back of 103 N. Main St. last Sept. 11 and Tra Holderbaum operates Healing Tree Crystals in the store’s front section. Yoga is open seven days a week with classes from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. There also is a program for kids ages 4 to 13 one Saturday a month. For more information the Yoga on Tilt website is: www.yogaontilt.co.

Healing Tree Crystals features a salt and crystals room and Mandy and Tra provide all energy healing treatments while the metal flower work around the building has been done by the building’s owner and is for sale Amanda said.

Dee Miller’s Den of Antiquities at 1 Canal St. E. has been in business in Navarre for five years but just moved three weeks ago into its current address. The store is open Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sundays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. By the end of March Miller hopes the store also will be open from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Thursday and Friday.

Fun things and dining

Events of note planned for this year include the Village Cake Walk on May 8 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. rain or shine. Tickets at $5 per person are available now through May 1 at several store locations. The annual three-day Navarre Garage Sale is planned for May 12-14; the St. Clement Holy Family Church annual festival June 9-11 at the church 216 E. Wooster St.; the annual Navarre Car Show on Sept. 25; and the Christmas in Navarre Celebration slated for Nov. 11 and 12 to kick off the holiday season.

Never at a loss for words Benson cited the Towpath Trail Navarre Bethlehem Community Park Market Street Park and Underwood Park as places for residents and visitors to enjoy the outdoors. Market Street Park is adjacent to the Towpath Trail YMCA at 1226 Market St. N. while Underwood is adjacent to the village’s Community Civic Center at 99 Canal St. W. The center housed the Navarre Fire Department before it merged with Bethlehem Fire to form the Erie Valley Fire and Rescue station behind Manely's Antique Mill.

Benson also noted Baylor Beach Park and Campgrounds south of the village on state Route 93 beyond Fairless High School as another fun spot along with Kremeland Diner and Dariette at 514 N. Main where ice cream and dining menus are available both inside and out.

Among the village’s other dining choices are Main Street Deli; Anderson’s in the Village coffee shop at 97 Canal St. W; BreakAway Sports Pub and Grill at 9 N. Main; and East of Chicago at 561 N. Main plus Kraus’ Pizza in Rochester.

“We are proud of our little community and the economic progress we have made to brighten our the future for our businesses and residents” said Benson who plans to spend more time with his wife of 55 years Patsy their 4-year-old grandson and the rest of the family.

The management of smaller grassed areas and in particular the cutting of them is a chore that is often left to a slack moment in a busy schedule especially in the spring when farms are most active.

Not so simple choice

Easing the task of regular cutting has attracted the attention of many manufacturers not least of which is Kubota which has a strong representation in the munster region in the shape of Atkins of Cork.

Choosing a machine to keep a smaller area of grass would on the face of it be a simple task but the situation may in fact be more complicated than picking a mower to go silaging with. The G series is the bedrock of the Kubota lawncare range. All of its machines come with ROPS as standard

The difference between cutting amenity areas and forage areas is that there is a much wider range of conditions in the former.

The areas range from a small domestic lawn to large paddock areas with anything from finely trimmed golf courses to rough verges in between.

The robots are coming

Away from the amenity sector it is domestic lawns which require the finest cut and while the pedestrian lawnmower is still a big seller there is a huge swing towards robotic mowers.

Mark Wolfe managing director of Atkins notes that robots have displaced up to 75% of new ride-on mower sales.

He does however qualify this by noting that they are agents for the Husqvarna systems which he believes lead the pack in terms of technology bringing new customers in. Husqvarna is a clear leader in robotic lawnmower technology according to Mark Wolfe

The cost of installing a robotic system will depend entirely on the area that needs cutting and the frequency of cut once every three days being the standard usually applied. The level of technology involved will also influence the final price.

He notes that GPS-guided robots are coming to market but they tend to be more expensive and have not yet totally displaced the need for a wire boundary to be buried around the area to be cut except on the largest amenity-focused models.

Ride-on mowers still in demand

Despite the popularity of robotics there is still a good market for ride-on mowers and David O’Sullivan Kubota sales representative for ground care equipment draws a distinct line between light duty petrol driven machines and the Kubota models. Kubota prefers the term grass cutters rather than lawnmowers when describing its range of machines. The sturdiness of the components sets them apart from consumer orientated products

There is naturally a steep price differential between the two but he points to the solidity of build and reliability of the engines of the Kubotas which are designed to last rather than simply be another consumer brand.

Kubota models start off with the familiar ride-on tractor lookalike format which they call the GR series. The base machine has a very neat little two-cylinder diesel that produces 13.5hp which will probably last indefinitely with regular servicing.

Although there are no hard and fast rules David suggests that a 0.5ac+ is the point at which homeowners would be justified in considering a basic ride on with larger models serving larger areas. The G261 comes with a shaft powered deck instead of using belts. Sheer pins are fitted to provide protection to the mechanism

These machines and the next series up known as the G Series are purpose designed grass cutters. As you move through the range the power cutting width and number of hydraulic services increase.

Another two options

Yet lawn tractors are not the sole grass cutters now available to those with large areas to be cut.

Two further formats are the ‘zero turn’ and ‘front mounted’ types which were once thought of as the preserve of professionals.

With power outputs starting at 21hp and 25hp respectively they are now worth considering by those with an ac or more. Zero turns are available with grass collection but the front mounted units are mulch only.

The front mounted cutters are known as the F series and these are available with up to 38hp as diesel powered units.

Not just diesels

Emission standards are now being applied to smaller engines and so another marque which Atkins sells has turned to combing battery power and small diesels to provide extra cutting capability. The Husqvarna P535HX Hybrid front mounted machine comes with electric transmission and a li-ion battery for extra boost

Husqvarna has introduced a hybrid which can either run on its diesel engine or electric motor alone.

When the two are combined it boots the power from the diesel’s 25hp to a total of 38hp thus circumnavigating the need to install exhaust treatment systems on the engine in certain markets.

For how long this boost will last is still an open question for they are still very new and untested in Ireland yet it is an indicator of how manufacturers are responding to legislation in ways which may not have been considered by those creating it.

Compacts and even sub compacts

If a ride-on may have the appearance of a tractor it has only one task and that is to cut grass. Should you wish to do more then a different machine altogether is required and here we enter the region of overlap with grass cutters and proper tractors. The Kubota BX 261 has a 26hp motor and may be fitted with a mid mounted deck a rear mounted mower and even a loader

Kubota kicks off with what it terms its sub compact tractors which translates to them being very small tractors indeed.

The starting point for compacts is the BX series which carries a central cutting deck and comes equipped with hydraulic linkage capable of lifting 550kg which is just 100kg short of its total weight.

To power the deck it has a mid mounted power take-off (PTO) which is a feature that differentiates the sub compacts from their larger brethren. This feature is also available in the B2 series which tops out at 26hp.

Presumably above that rating a deck capable of using the power becomes too unwieldy to mount between the axles and so a front PTO is offered instead.

Implements to increase versatility

Third party implements for smaller tractors and compacts are readily available and Kubota itself offers a selection including rotary pasture toppers which will enable them to both cut lawns and trim rough pasture.

With the sub compact tractors the option also arises of using a trailed or rear mounted mower which may be more convenient than Kubota’s own deck although the saving may not be that great. With rear linkage and PTO the sub compact tractors offer great versatility. This BX is fitted with industrial pattern tyres

BX tractors and above are also available with a loader as an optional extra which suddenly transforms them from a top end lawnmower to something altogether more versatile and capable.

Kubota is perhaps unique in offering such a range from humble push lawnmower to sophisticated mini tractor that has many of the functions of larger units but on a scale that renders them practical around lawns buildings and yards.

To add to the versatility the sub compacts are available with industrial tyres. These are a half way house between the agricultural and turf care options which offer more grip than the latter but don’t mark soft ground like the former.

They are according to David becoming a popular choice and there is no price difference between them when the tractor is ordered new.

They would appear to be an ideal compromise for stable or yard work where good grip rather than ultimate traction is sufficient.

With such a wide range of machines on offer the decision as to which best matches the needs of a customer may not always be obvious and so it is best to avail of the advice that specialist dealers can offer. On display but already sold. Supply is very tight according to Atkins

One fly presently in the ointment is that having decided on the machine to buy it may not actually be available in time for this season.

There are bottlenecks in the supply stream with Kubota having to ration out the machines as they come in from the factory.

Nearly all the compacts on display are sold according to David so it is a question of getting the order in as soon as possible to take delivery this year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vZ3JlZW5idWlsZGluZ2VsZW1lbnRzLmNvbS9iZXN0LXNvbGFyLWZlbmNlLWNoYXJnZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best Solar Fence Charger In 2024 (Reviews & Buyers Guide),"Not sure about which solar fence charger you need?

You already know of the advantages that come with a good solar-powered fence charger. But the consequences for picking the wrong one are severe. You might undercharge your fence meaning you’ve wasted your money. Or worse you might overcharge your fence and end up injuring or killing your animals!

After reading our well-researched buying guide all your doubts will vanish and you’ll be able to pick the best solar fence charger for your land. Be it a farm pasture or a small garden we’ve got the perfect option for every situation.

Top 10 Solar Fence Charger Reviews

Harnessing the power of the sun to keep an electric fence charged is not only cheaper for you (since you just need to buy the device) but better for the environment (1). Read on to see the top 10 products that made our list of the best solar fence chargers of 2021.

But if you’d like to check out the buying guide first click here.

1. Gallagher S40 Solar Fence Charger – Top Pick Specifications Type: Low-Impedance

Range: 25 miles (single-wire) or 5 miles (multi-wire)

Output Volts: 7800 V

Impulse Energy: 0.29 J

Solar Panel’s Wattage: 4W

Weather-proof: Yes

Warranty: 3 Years View Today’s Price

Packed with plenty of power and some impressive weather-proofing features the Gallagher S40 tops our list as the best overall solar fence charger. It’s durable enough to withstand a lot of wear and tear but portable enough that you can easily transport it to the farthest reaches of your land – without breaking your back.

Whether you need to keep livestock included or wildlife and intruders excluded this solar-powered electric fence charger does its job brilliantly. And it works well for rotational grazing too.

The S40’s exterior is water-resistant and includes built-in lightning protection so it’s safe and easy to install just about anywhere. Depending on your setup the S40 can power up to 25 miles of single wire fence or up to 5 miles of multi-wire fencing.

One of the main reasons we love this charger is how powerful it is. The 7800V low-impedance charger stores 0.4 Joules of energy and the impulse it delivers is 0.29 J. Though not the highest on this list it can easily handle cattle horses pigs and bulls – and any nasty intruders too. Here’s what Tyler a farmer and popular YouTuber from Northern California has to say about this unit (2):

I’m really happy with this energizer. The features are good it’s well-made and it comes with a three-year warranty.

Additionally with a built-in solar panel and a rechargeable 6V battery you have a reliable power source in any weather. This battery keeps on powering up your fence for up to three weeks without the sun so it’s perfect for the winters too.

Another key feature of the S40 is the adjustable power settings. You can set the charger to pulse less frequently at night when the animals are less active to conserve power. Likewise if you use it to keep nuisance animals away you can lessen the power by day and crank it up at night for the nocturnal invaders!

If this much power is overkill for your property you should also check out the Gallagher S16 and Gallagher S10 variants. They offer similar features and performance but with lower output voltage and energy so they’re better for smaller animals like chickens.

If you want the best solar fence charger available right now look no further than the Gallagher S40. Its modern design weather-proofing high energy output and portability make it worthy of any purpose you can think of. Just set it up and forget it.

Plus it’s backed by a 3-year warranty that includes lightning strikes so your investment stays safe even in the harshest weather.

If you want a solar fence charger without breaking the bank the Zareba ESP5M-Z is a great budget option. It’s a durable well-built product that’s easy to install and still offers commendable performance across small to medium length fences.

Its range is limited to 5 miles so it works well for medium farms and gardens. But if you have a multi-wire or poly wire fence then the range is going to reduce significantly down to about 1 mile.

This one is particularly great for cattle chickens pigs and other smaller animals as it offers a shock of 0.10 Joules. It might not be very effective in deterring larger and thicker animals like goats and sheep though.

This is also very portable. You can install it permanently if you like or keep it temporarily for moving fences.

The low-impedance design ensures performance even if the fencing has weeds growing on them. It outputs roughly 6000-9000V depending on the type of fence and grounding.

The built-in 360 degree rotating mounting bracket fits T-posts round and wood posts Y-posts and flat surfaces. You can angle it any way you like for maximum sunlight exposure.

How to Buy the Best Solar Electric Fence Charger for You (Top 5 Tips)

Phew! That is a lot of information on some really cool products. We’ve researched and compiled our top 5 tips to help you pick the solar fence charger that’s right for YOU.

1. Calculate the minimum output voltage and joules required to contain your animals

Selecting the best solar electric fence charger for you starts with the output voltage and joules because if they are too low your fence won’t contain (or deter) the animals in question. This differs for different animals so you should know how much you’ll need for your farm or garden.

So to clear any confusion let’s define what voltage and joules mean in real terms. The output voltage is the ‘capability of current to flow through the animal’ or simply a higher voltage means that current will flow through even the most thick-skinned animals (like sheep) with ease (5 6).

Joules also known as impulse energy or ‘shock strength’ is the actual amount of output current that is imparted to the animal.

So a higher joules rating means that the electric shock will be much stronger and more intense (7). Too large a shock can actually injure or kill animals so we need to be careful about this.

The joules rating is also important in the range of a fence. A higher joules means the fence can maintain an effective shock even at a longer range.

Now you can obviously have a fence that serves the double duty of keeping your cattle in and predators out. That’s why it’s essential to evaluate your own situation and determine your needs to create a custom electric fence solution (8). Here are the voltage requirements for some of the more common animals (9 10):

Animal Voltage Required Chickens Dogs And Pets 500-1000V Nuisance Animals (like Raccoons) 1000-2000V Cattle Pigs And Horses 2000-4000V Deer and Elk 3000-5000V Sheep And Goats 4000-5000V Wolves And Coyotes 5000-6000V Bears 6000-7000V Table: Minimum Voltage Requirements For Different Animals

Note that the rated voltage for most products is an ideal value under perfect conditions. With real-world usage it is going to be much less and will depend on the fencing wire number of strands resistance etc. Hence you should usually go for a higher-rated fence charger.

2. Ensure that the solar fence charger you want has enough range

Charging a fence around a small vegetable garden is very different from energizing several acres of grazing land. So you need to pick your solar fence charger accordingly. The range of a fence energizer depends on many factors such as the type and number of fence wires their overall resistance the quality of grounding the soil etc.

Interestingly while it’s tempting to rely on the area (acreage) it’s better to focus more on the perimeter of the fence (mileage). Either way we recommend checking these parameters using an online tool like Google Maps or ACME’s Planimeter (11). They’re super easy to use and offer accurate information on the perimeter and area of your farm.

But you should note that the indicated range of a solar fence charger is only achieved under the best conditions with high-quality wires. Real-world usage generally offers a lower range than expected.

Hence it’s crucial to know the kind of fence you’ll be using and the grounding as these two factors are the most significant. You should also clear any vegetation and undergrowth and keep your soil moist and well-watered to ensure maximum performance.

For example you look at a charger with a range of thirty miles. If you have a single strand that is thirty miles long you’re in business. However if you have three or four strands covering thirty miles then you need something with a 90-120 miles range to achieve effective electric fencing.

3. Make sure you get the right type of solar fence charger

After reading our solar fence charger reviews it’s easy to see so many options on the market. However all of these solar chargers can be broken down into two main types that each have benefits and disadvantages.

Low-Impedance Charger

Most of the newer models of solar fence chargers are low-impedance chargers because they are more efficient and effective for managing animals. These are a significant improvement over previous technologies such as the high-impedance continuous output ones that could be dangerous.

Low-impedance chargers increase the amount of energy they put out when there is a heavier load on the fence like overgrown weeds or brush.

To do this they hold a reserve and release it as needed. Consequently low-impedance chargers manage power better and last longer.

Additionally low-impedance chargers emit stronger shocks to animals – not so strong as to harm them but enough to deter larger animals. Also these chargers don’t deliver a continuous shock but rather a pulse with an interval of 1-2 seconds. So animals have a chance to move away before receiving another jolt.

If your animals still have trouble seeing your fence and continue to shock themselves consider adding some dusk to dawn solar outdoor lighting to help illuminate these tough-to-see areas.

We strongly suggest choosing a low-impedance charger for several reasons. They last longer handle power better and tend to have a greater range than the alternatives.

Solid-State Fence Charger

Solid-state fence chargers are an older technology but many people still use these. They work well with aluminum or steel fences and are generally a bit cheaper than low-impedance.

These chargers deliver a lesser shock than the low-impedance but it’s still enough to deter unwanted animals while keeping your livestock safe. Plus the medium voltage shock won’t harm your livestock but they won’t like the feeling so they will tend to avoid the fence.

Additionally these chargers produce shocks in pulses so animals have a chance to get away before they get shocked again. The pulse feature makes these chargers safer for humans and pets.

Of course this type of charger works better for smaller animals or those with short fur since the shock is not as strong. Weeds and brush can also impact the effectiveness so it’s extra important to maintain the vegetation around this type of solar-powered fence charger.

4. Consider your area’s weed problems

How overgrown is the land around your electric fence? Don’t worry; we’re not passing judgment on how you keep up your land. You may be surprised to learn that the weed conditions around the fence can actually impact the efficiency of your electric fence and solar fence charger.

Dense weeds that grow tall enough to reach the wires on your fence create problems by impacting the efficiency of the electric current. A lot of weed and brush leaning on the wire leads to a loss of voltage and pushes the energy to other parts of the fence line.

It’s a good idea to encourage grass growth along the fence and maintain the areas as much as possible. Allowing grass to grow thick and higher than usual like three to four inches is an excellent way to crowd out weeds and prevent the drain on your electric fence.

5. Consider your area’s weather conditions sunlight soil and lightning

Like your electric fence your solar charger is probably outside where it’s exposed to the elements. It’s easy to feel good about your solar charger on a sunny summer day but what about during a severe storm or snow or extreme cold? Before selecting a charger look at how well it can handle the elements.

Weather

You can mitigate elements like the wind by securely anchoring your charger to the ground or post. Since you need to ground the charger anyway it doesn’t take a lot of extra work to secure your charger.

However wind isn’t the only consideration especially for open areas that get a lot of rain and snow. You should pick a waterproof solar fence charger so that it keeps water on the outside. On the contrary water-resistant products can only survive mild rainfall and may fail due to heavy downpours (12).

So you should consider the amount of precipitation you get throughout the year. You don’t want to choose a charger with a case that cannot handle the amount of rain or snow thrown at it. After all chasing down animals after a thunderstorm is miserable!

Sunlight

You should make sure that the solar panel is aptly positioned for optimal sunlight exposure. It should not have any shadows or vegetation that may block the path of light from 9 AM to 3 PM when the sun shines bright.

Along with that it’s important to choose a solar panel that can keep your battery charged all the time even when the sun isn’t out. Most of the products listed here can run for 2-3 weeks even without sunlight so they’ll keep running even in the winter season.

Soil

An essential aspect of grounding is the soil all along the fence line and around your farm. This soil needs to be moist and well-watered with a lot of minerals to ensure that it can conduct electricity properly. Dry soil will result in poor grounding. Remember that grounding is the most important component in the design of an electric fence system (13).

If your fence energizer is not properly grounded then it will not deliver an appropriate shock and will be ineffective.

If you’re not sure about the soil in your area we recommend getting it tested by an expert. You don’t want to spend a couple hundred dollars on a fence energizer and find out that it’s not working due to poor grounding.

Lightning Protection

In many cases you anchor a charger to a metal post which leaves it susceptible to damage caused by lightning strikes. Some chargers include in-built lightning protection or at least include a lightning diverter as a part of the kit. If you select a charger that doesn’t have either of these you may need to purchase a lightning diverter or lightning arrester separately to protect your charger.

Some of these products also have warranties that include lightning damage. If you live in a lightning-prone area we recommend choosing a product that has that such as the Gallagher S40 and S400.

The Bottom Line: What is the Best Solar Fence Charger to Buy Today?

That concludes our solar fence charger reviews and buying guide. If you’re still on the fence (get it?) then let’s wrap it up quickly.

For those looking for the best overall quality we highly recommend our top choice the Gallagher S40. It’s portable durable and powerful enough to maintain a charge for up to 25 miles. Plus the S40 ticks the right boxes – a 3-year warranty three-week battery life and built-in lightning protection.

But if you want something cheap and simple you can’t go wrong with the Zareba ESP5M-Z. It’s affordable but still offers a lot of power and range. This will work well for small gardens and short single-wire fences.

And for those looking for sheer power and a massive range the Gallagher S400 is the way to go. A single unit could power a 60-mile long fence. That’s downright insane! For big farms and pastures this is simply the best choice.

At the end of the day we hope that we helped you in your journey to find the best solar fence for your needs!

(Photo courtesy Flair Airlines)

It’s not uncommon for airlines to come and go with little or no notice. This sort of behavior is more common with the fair-weather air carriers that come up during the summer then retreat when the snow flies.

But it’s unusual for a long-time cruise operator after an absence of two years to invite travelers to pen a love letter to Alaska. That invitation comes courtesy of a contest in which Holland America Line is offering 10 winners suite accommodations on one of their ships this summer.

First let’s take a look at some smaller airlines’ plans for Anchorage.

Until the COVID-19 pandemic crippled the travel infrastructure in 2020 Yakutia Airlines had been flying back and forth between Anchorage and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky since the summer of 2012. Yakutia was hired by InterPacific Aviation and Marketing in Seattle to fly the route under the AirRussia brand.

During the summer schedule which lasted between mid-July and mid-September Yakutia operated the only passenger airline service between Alaska and Asia. The flight lasted 4 1/2 hours.

The Kamchatka Peninsula has some incredible wilderness including the Valley of the Geysers which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. But it was fishermen who filled up the plane each summer. Sport fishermen were flying to Kamchatka to raft the wild rivers and catch giant trout and salmon.

Mark Dudley of AirRussia said the flights have been canceled for the third summer in a row because of the pandemic. We discussed the deteriorating relations between the U.S. and Russia and agreed that it could have been canceled for a number of reasons. “But it really was because of COVID” he said. “There’s a process in Russia and a determination must be made by a certain date.”

At about the same time AirRussia was canceling its schedule another airline announced plans to fly nonstop from Vancouver British Columbia to Anchorage this summer.

Flair Airlines is a Canadian ULCC or ultra low cost carrier. The easiest way to summarize that designation is that every part of your trip has a price tag. The base fare is just a starting point for adding the features that are important to you.

Several other ULCCs fly to Anchorage during the summer including Frontier Airlines to Denver and Sun Country Airlines to Minneapolis. Allegiant Air another ULCC used to fly during the summer from Anchorage to Bellingham. But the carrier canceled for the 2020 season and has not returned.

Garth Lund is Flair Airlines’ chief commercial officer. He’s been with the carrier a little less than a year. Before that he worked for another ULCC based in Europe called Wizz Air.

“Coming out of COVID Vancouverites still are looking for outdoor tourism” he said. “It’s very popular.”

Flair Airlines operates a fleet of 737-800s and the new 737 MAX8s. Starting May 19 Flair will offer twice-weekly red-eye service between Vancouver and Anchorage. The northbound flights come up late in the evening on Sundays and Thursdays then return just after midnight on Mondays and Fridays.

Fares start at $65 each way.

That’s cheap. With the “Bare Bundle” you can take along a personal item that weighs up to 7 kilograms. The “Basic Bundle” which includes a carry-on bag of up to 10 kg and a checked bag up to 23 kg costs $52.

If you want to choose a pre-assigned seat it will cost you between $12 and $35. Otherwise a seat will be assigned at check-in.

According to Lund the seat pitch is about 30 inches between rows about the same as United Airlines. You can choose to pay extra for 3 more inches of legroom.

This summer Air Canada also is flying nonstop to Vancouver. Its fares start at $205 one-way. Add $86 for a checked bag and seat assignment.

Lund also mentioned that since cruise ships hope to once again sail from Vancouver Flair Airlines will offer flights for cruise travelers.

Speaking of cruise companies they’re gearing up for a busy season this summer.

Holland America Line will have six ships sailing in Alaska this summer. The company traces its Alaska connections back 75 years since it purchased Westours. Alaska tourism pioneer Chuck West started Westours in Fairbanks in 1947. Holland America is part of Carnival which also owns Carnival Cruise Lines Princess Cruises and a bunch of other cruise companies.

To celebrate 75 years in Alaska as well as the resumption of cruising in the state Holland America Line is asking travelers to write a love letter to Alaska.

When I read Holland America’s announcement about this contest I pushed my chair back from my desk and just stared at the notice. Then I went to the website loveletterstoalaska.com and found that the maximum word count was 250 words.

Sailing to Alaska has been a trend in my family for more than 80 years. In 1941 my uncle sailed up to work construction in Kodiak aboard the S.S. Mt. McKinley with the Alaska Steamship Co. Five years later my father sailed up. He failed to note the name of the troop carrier — and he didn’t take any pictures on the trip out to Attu.

Alaska means so much to me that I had no problem cranking out 248 words. Then I hit send.

Erik Elvejord of Holland America said the contest “shows the depth of our connection” to Alaska.

Bill Fletcher has worked in the tourist industry for most of the 40 years he’s spent in Alaska mostly for Holland America. “I love showing people a piece of ice that’s thousands of years old — and how that ice carved an entire valley” he said. “It blows people away.”

Fletcher was transformed after his first summer in Alaska working for Westours. “There’s just nothing that even comes close” he said. “It’s the wild grandeur. The tallest mountains and the deepest fjords.”

Holland America bought full-page newspaper ads in New York L.A. Houston Miami and a host of other cities to prompt travelers to write their letters. It’s their way of celebrating a return to Alaska after being gone for two years.

Some travelers will write about how they’ve tried to come to Alaska but couldn’t. Others may write about their once-in-a-lifetime trip — and what it meant to their family. Then there are those of us who came to Alaska and stayed.

Warnings & Dangers in Mississippi

OVERALL RISK: MEDIUM Mississippi is the 8th ranked state in the country when it comes to crime rates. While this is true you can still feel safe there because most of the crime is concentrated in areas where tourists wouldn't typically visit. As long as you stay in recommended areas you will be safe.

TRANSPORT & TAXIS RISK: LOW There is hardly ever crime associated with private or public transportation companies in Mississippi. The key to staying safe with transport is to avoid using companies that seem unsafe. The accountability of rideshare apps is great for staying safe while traveling.

PICKPOCKETS RISK: LOW There is a very small chance your wallet or purse will get stolen while traveling in Mississippi. Of course there is always the chance but anyone who practices at least moderate safety precautions won't get their stuff stolen.

NATURAL DISASTERS RISK: MEDIUM Avoid visiting the coastal regions of Mississippi during the late spring when hurricanes are most prevalent. Hurricanes have been known in the past to come up the coast from Florida and Louisiana to decimate the coast of Mississippi near Biloxi.

MUGGING RISK: LOW There is almost no risk you will get mugged in the state of Mississippi unless you are in particularly unsafe areas of the biggest cities like Jackson. Just stick to familiar areas where tourists and travelers frequent and you will experience almost zero risk of being mugged or attacked in any way.

TERRORISM RISK: LOW Terrorism is basically non-existent in the state of Mississippi. This is true for both international and domestic incidents in the state. When you travel there there is no need to be concerned about a terrorist attack in any way.

SCAMS RISK: LOW Face-to-face scams are non-existent in Mississippi. Your only real chance of getting taken advantage of while you are in the state is when you are booking the hotel flight and cars online. Avoid using websites that don't seem trustworthy to book your vacation. Be careful who you give your personal information to online.

WOMEN TRAVELERS RISK: LOW In tourist areas the risk for women is higher than the risk of being attacked for men. This is true everywhere. The overall risk for women travelers in the area is still extremely low compared to other areas around the world. Overall Mississippi is safe for women.

TAP WATER RISK: LOW The tap water in Mississippi is supplied from natural sources and treated by facilities around the state. It has been classified as safe to drink so you can drink safely at any restaurant or straight from the tap where you are staying. There is no reason to carry your own water if you don't want to.

Safest Places to Visit in Mississippi

If safety is your number one concern while you are traveling in Mississippi the city of Madison might be the place for you.

It’s a great location because it is a suburb of the capital city of Jackson so you still have access to everything the state’s biggest city has to offer.

Madison also has the lowest crime rate in the state.

This makes it a great place to book your hotel or Air BnB.

If you want to check out the city of Memphis TN while you are in Mississippi stay in the suburb of Horn Lake Mississippi.

It’s also in the top five in the state when it comes to crime rates making it an ideal place to stay when you want to experience all of the musical histories that the city of Memphis has to offer.

If you stay in one of these two cities it is extremely unlikely you will have an issue with crime during your trip.

Places to Avoid in Mississippi

If you want to stay safe while you are traveling in Mississippi there are some areas you will want to avoid.

Jackson is the most violent city but that is to be expected in any of the bigger cities in the United States.

Even though it has its issues with crime the crime is localized.

This means you should be OK if you plan on staying in areas that are comfortable for tourists.

One area of Jackson MS you will want to avoid while you are there is Gautier.

There are areas in Biloxi you will want to avoid while you are there too.

Any city near water generally has issues compared to other areas because of the kind of business that is attracted to the area.

If you are staying in Biloxi be sure to check online to ensure the hotel you are considering booking is in a crime-free area.

Safety Tips for Traveling to Mississippi

Check the state website. Go to visitmississippi.com before your trip to see all the current travel advisories issued by the state. This will give you an idea of the most recent dangers around the state including crime and weather warnings. Ask the locals. The people in the southeastern part of the United States are known for being friendly and helpful. They can be a great source of information for things to check out and things to avoid while you are there. Don’t be afraid to ask around. Don’t give too much information. Don’t give out too much information like where you are staying or your day’s itinerary while you are there. This could give a potential thief a good idea of when your hotel room is going to be left unguarded. Talk to locals but don’t be an open book. Know the driving laws. Before you rent a car and drive around the state be sure to familiarize yourself with the driving laws in the state. The last thing you want is to get in an accident or get an expensive driving ticket while you are there. Use a safe. If you have extremely valuable belongings with you while you are traveling store them in a small safe in your hotel room. It’s not a good idea to walk around with expensive jewelry or watches on you all day. It can make you a target. Don’t be scared to pay for safety. If there is a safety precaution that costs a little more money on your trip pay for it. There is no price too high when it comes to you and your family’s safety when you are traveling. Travel in packs. Make sure you stay with your traveling party while you are on vacation. Breaking off solo to do some exploring can be fun but it can make you a target for potential thieves and criminals. This is especially true if you are a woman. Tell your bank. Tell your bank you are going to be traveling before you go. If they don’t know they may shut off your debit card because of fraudulent activity while you are gone. This could leave you without any money for a day or two while you are on the road. Tell your friends. Don’t make the mistake of not telling anyone back home you are going on a trip. Leave your schedule and contact information with some friends or family back home so they can find you and get in touch with you if there is an emergency. Check ATMs. Don’t use a sketchy ATM that doesn’t seem trustworthy. Check the card reader and pin pad to make sure it is normal. Sometimes criminals will place card readers on ATMs in an attempt to steal your bank information. You are still at risk of digital crime when you are on vacation too.

So... How Safe Is Mississippi Really?

Overall Mississippi is an extremely safe place for tourists to visit and have fun.

Some areas in the state can be dangerous but they aren’t places that you would typically visit while you are on vacation.

This is true of any area in the world though.

If you are visiting Jackson or Biloxi Google neighborhoods or ask your hotel front desk what areas you should avoid while you are there.

Mississippi is the poorest state in the United States so there are some desperate people there that may want to commit crimes for financial gain there.

The key is to project confidence avoid bad areas and never present yourself as someone who could be a victim.

If you are visiting Mississippi to hunt practice general hunting safety and you should be fine.

The hunters there are experienced and professional so you shouldn’t have any issues with safety.

Overall Mississippi is a very safe state for travelers.

Former Atlanta Braves outfielder Ralph Garr says the baseball scholarship he earned at Grambling State helped set the stage for his career. (Emil Moffatt/WABE)

Garr went on to play 13 years in the major leagues – eight of them with the Braves. He led the National League in hitting in 1974 and made the All-Star team that year.

“It so happened that summer I made the baseball team and I was granted a scholarship to go to Grambling” said Garr. “And the rest of it is history.”

When he first went college at Grambling State Ralph Garr wasn’t on a baseball scholarship and he had to take a summer job to pay for school.

Historically Black colleges and universities have produced at least two important figures in Atlanta Braves history – Garr and longtime executive Bill Lucas.

The HBCU Baseball Classic which took place over the weekend honored Garr and Lucas and is presented by the Braves and Truist. It’s the second year for the event.



Both years have featured Grambling State and Florida A&M.



‘The next level’

Standing behind home plate at Coolray Field in Gwinnett County on Friday Garr was dressed in a gold Grambling sweater and a navy blue Braves cap.

“I’m so glad to be a part of a wonderful organization that is doing what the Braves are doing now – giving these young men an opportunity to play baseball and help make better men and that helps make a better world” Garr said.

While Garr went to Grambling State it was Florida A&M where Lucas played college ball before becoming baseball’s first Black general manager in 1976. Lucas was a member of the Braves organization for more than 20 years before his death in 1979.

HBCUs helped Lucas and Garr find careers in pro baseball. And part of the point of the HBCU Classic is to make sure today’s HBCU athletes get the same chance.

Jamey Shouppe coaches at Florida A&M. He took the job after decades as an assistant at Florida State.

“The funding at HBCUs is not what it should be from scholarship allotment to facilities and all” said Shouppe. “But I tell you what the quality of play is getting very very close to what I remember from big-time D-1 baseball.”

Davin Pierre Grambling’s coach says a weekend series on a big stage could help open some doors.

“There’s going to be a lot of people watching this game and our kids have the opportunity and a platform to go out and show that they can play at a high level and have the exposure to be able to get seen and maybe have a chance to get drafted and play at the next level” Pierre said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A Prairie Village product design firm is helping a nearby Kansas startup advance groundbreaking medical technology to treat previously-inoperable cancer tumors with minimally-invasive surgery.

“Most of us have been affected by cancer through family friends or our own experience and we are delighted to help Precision Microwave create better tools to fight cancer” said Chris Justice principal at Engenious Design a Kansas City-metro company specializing in electronic medical device design.

The teams at Engenious and Manhattan-based Precision Microwave have developed a new system for minimally-invasive thermal ablation treatment of cancers a novel treatment tool with ability to reduce the risk of unintended injury to vital structures near tumors the companies said in a press release.

Thermal ablation is a type of procedure that uses heat cold microwave and electrical currents to vaporize (ablate) cancer cells and tumors.

The new technology complements existing options for thermal ablation and greatly expands the tools available to surgeons that address challenging cases and broaden the range of cases that could be safely and effectively treated.

“Precision Microwave’s technology is truly innovative and works to provide more precise control to surgeons; control that allows targeting of cancers and preservation of adjacent vital structures” Justice said. “The Precision Microwave team has developed technology that is a game-changer in cancer therapy and we are excited to partner and bring this technology to market quickly.”

Since its founding in 2013 by spouses Chris and Holly Justice the Engenious Design team has grown from 2 to more than 40 team members — with expertise and capabilities including an on-site electronics lab quick-turn model shop and short-run production capabilities with a full medical device quality management system.

“Engenious Design has been the perfect partner for a small startup medical device company like us” said Austin Pfannenstiel founder and CEO of Precision Microwave emphasizing understanding of startup constraints and demands to maximize value. “I have been consistently impressed by their team’s tremendous depth of knowledge and experience spanning technical and industrial design clinical insight and regulatory considerations which has enabled us to stay focused on leveraging our own strengths while making significant progress towards commercialization.”

Precision Microwave’s system was recently granted a key patent protecting the unique directional ablation technology. Its regulatory strategy also employs a faster and lower-risk path to FDA clearance by leveraging predicate devices the company said. Precision Microwave has already received $1.2 million in grant funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and are working to close additional funds to pursue FDA clearance and commercialization.

Pfannenstiel’s R&D experience includes more than 6 years developing novel microwave technologies for precise image-guided thermal ablation of cancer and he is a co-author on one granted patent and three patent applications in the field.

He also spent seven years in the US Navy as a submarine officer and nuclear power instructor and continues to serve in the US Navy Reserve.

Precision Microwave maintains close collaborative relationships with a network of physicians specialized in thermal ablation procedures as well as the Kansas State University Colleges of Engineering and Veterinary Medicine the company said.

Tied together the three initiatives highlight a progressive approach to the future of moving goods and equipment across the world that could create jobs and investments in Arkansas.

First Tuesday morning electric vehicle manufacturer Envirotech Vehicles Inc. announced it would move its corporate headquarters and manufacturing operations to Osceola and create 800 new jobs in the Mississippi County community. Envirotech said it wanted to be near a major supplier U.S. Steel and take advantage of other abundant resources chiefly the Mississippi River. The company's $80.7 million investment could grow by another $200 million as electric vehicle production picks up over the next few years.

Let that sink in for a minute -- a California company based in the greater Los Angeles area is packing up and moving to an Arkansas town with less than 10000 residents.

Later Tuesday morning Gov. Asa Hutchinson launched what he said would be a full-fledged effort to support future mobility initiatives in the state -- he wants to create a business environment and workforce that promotes emerging technologies and encourages efforts to deliver and move goods and people across the country and the world.

The Arkansas Council on Future Mobility the governor said will ""lay the foundation for Arkansas leadership in the transportation industry for decades to come.""

That includes promoting electric vehicles drones driverless vehicles and air-mobility vehicles that can take off and land vertically. He announced 17 appointees to the council -- including key executives from global leaders like Walmart Tyson Foods Google and J.B Hunt Transportation Services Inc. among others.

The governor appointed Cyrus Sigari of Up Partners a California venture capital firm to chair the council. Hutchinson said Sigari is considered one of the world's leading experts on future mobility and is an expert in advanced air mobility.

Sigari is also key to the week's third announcement that was issued Wednesday by the Runway Group of Bentonville which is led by Steuart and Tom Walton grandsons of Walmart founder Sam Walton. Runway has built a team of supporters and financial backers to promote air mobility initiatives that can move goods and equipment through the air.

Now digest for a second the supply-chain issues being experienced worldwide with snarled shipping traffic that has slowed delivery of essential products and equipment to businesses everywhere.

Going airborne with vehicles -- smaller and more environmentally sustainable than the jets used today by global carriers like UPS FedEx and Amazon -- could avoid supply chain knots tying up deliveries today. Airborne vehicles would be more efficient and effective in short trips as well.

Arkansas has a long and successful history of building and supporting transportation efforts through the trucking industry. One key to the futuristic approach is including those carriers in the mobility efforts -- and that has been done both with the governor's council and the air-mobility initiative that has drawn a multi-million-dollar investment from the Walton team. Sigari's capital venture firm Up Partners is a member of the Runway initiative.

The Runway announcement noted air mobility could deliver $3.6 billion in new economic activity and related stimulus to Arkansas over the next 20 years.

Arkansas could be the hub of mobility companies in the future the announcement said calling for a combined effort to ""strive to create the Jetsons-like paradise"" with flying cars and delivery vehicles along with drones that drop packages at our doorsteps.

Sigari in comments Tuesday as he was announced to lead the governor's mobility council said Arkansas can foster growth and development of mobility companies just as Silicon Valley nurtured the technology giants of today.

""Some of the most transformative internet companies were built in Silicon Valley"" he said Tuesday. ""We believe some of the most transformative mobility companies will be built here in Arkansas.""

SOLAR BANKING

Peoples Bank of Sheridan has installed a 56-kilowatt solar array that will make it one of the first community banks in Arkansas to be completely powered by solar energy.

The bank's solar array is expected to save more than $243000 in energy costs over the next 30 years. The system installed by Delta Solar of Little Rock is designed to produce enough power to offset energy usage at the bank's Sheridan headquarters.

""Delta Solar's team provided us a personalized solar solution that made sense environmentally and economically"" said Craig Manatt president and chief executive officer of Peoples Bank. ""Our solar system is a win-win for the bank as we were able to significantly reduce our electricity costs while generating a strong return on our investment.""

Delta Solar is Arkansas owned and operated. ""We are excited to have collaborated with Peoples Bank to design and build a system that meets 100% of their energy needs and provides significant cost savings to help better serve their customers and community"" said Bob East chairman of Delta Solar.

RECORD YEAR AT ARVEST EQUIPMENT

Arvest Equipment Finance had a record year in 2021 with more than $418.6 million in gross production a year-over-year increase of more than 49%. The division of Arvest Bank also saw its total portfolio jump more than 33% year-over-year from $513.7 million in 2020 to $685 million last year.

""We are proud of the growth we saw last year and more importantly pleased we were able to help so many customers"" Arkansas Equipment Finance president Eric Bunnell said.

Growth is allowing the division to add a medical equipment program to its portfolio.

Arvest Equipment Finance is based in Fort Smith and has offices in Little Rock Kansas City and Tulsa. It does business in Arvest Bank's four-state operating area: Arkansas Kansas Missouri and Oklahoma.

They also said they would impose new restrictions on Russia’s central bank to prevent it from using its large international reserves to undermine sanctions.

The actions agreed to by the European Commission Britain Canada France Germany Italy and the United States represented a significant escalation in the effort to impose severe economic costs on Russia over President Vladimir V. Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine.

“Russia’s war represents an assault on fundamental international rules and norms that have prevailed since the Second World War which we are committed to defending” the countries said in a joint statement. “We will hold Russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for Putin.”

The announcement was a remarkable change of direction for European powers that until recent days were reluctant to end a 30-year effort to integrate Russia into the European economy.

Russians are standing in long lines to withdraw foreign currencies from ATMs as Western sanctions send the ruble to a record low against the US dollar.

On Monday the Russian ruble tumbled nearly 30% against the greenback dropping to as low as 119 against the dollar according to Reuters.

The plunge came after the European Commission said on Saturday that Western allies will slap restrictive measures on the Russian Central Bank's international reserves worth $630 billion.

Through a carrot-and-stick approach investors and banks (and soon governments) use ESG to push businesses to change how they function regardless of what the employees and customers of those businesses want. In many cases however corporate executives are all too willing to go along because they want access to the cheap capital offered by investors and financial institutions.

The widespread adoption of ESG metrics which is also commonly called “stakeholder capitalism”—is meant to radically alter how businesses are evaluated expanding considerations beyond traditional economic metrics like profit revenue debt customer satisfaction and product development.

Instead of looking at economic and financial considerations ESG social credit metrics measure things like “Percentage of active workforce covered under collective bargaining agreements” (union labor) and “Percentage of employees per employee category by age group gender and other indicators of diversity (e.g. ethnicity).”

(To learn more about the basics of ESG read my ESG primer here or watch my recorded presentation for The Heartland Institute here.)

Unlike many corporations which spend substantial time and resources self-reporting ESG individual investors and most small businesses typically do not produce their own ESG reports. Instead large financial services companies and banks have produced them for these groups often without individuals or businesses asking for the reports.

For instance Merrill Lynch a division of Bank of America produces ESG scores for all or nearly all of its individual investment accounts even for those whose value is $1000 or less.

Moody’s has created an “ESG Score Predictor” that offers users with ESG reports for 100000 businesses many of which have never produced their own ESG metrics. Moody’s algorithm predicts scores by using “company size location and industry as inputs.”

When individuals and small businesses have raised concerns about the use of ESG and how it could be used against them—as opposed to merely being applied to corporations for the benefit of investors—banks investment groups and their lobbyists have claimed that concerns over ESG are nothing but “conspiracy theories.”

However the evidence shows that there are very good reasons to believe that financial institutions and banks plan to dramatically expand the use of ESG soon for individuals families and small businesses a move that would dramatically change the U.S. economy and society. Below are the five most important reasons for all Americans to be concerned.

1. There Are Already Many Examples of Individuals and Businesses Being Denied Access to Financial Services or Capital Based on Subjective Criteria

It’s impossible to know to what extent individuals organizations and businesses are now being denied access to financial services including loans based on subjective criteria because there are no databases nor reporting agencies tasked with compiling denials based on non-financial reasons. However news outlets have reported many examples of such actions and some industry reports openly admit that discrimination is common.

For example Deutsche Bank AG and Signature Bank announced in early 2021 that would no longer provide services to former President Donald Trump or his business the Trump Organization purely for ideological reasons.

In November 2021 WePay a J.P. Morgan Chase-owned payment processor informed the Missouri-based Defense of Liberty political action committee that it would stop offering its services to the organization after it planned an event featuring Donald Trump Jr. (Chase later reversed the decision but only after “Missouri treasurer Scott Fitzpatrick threatened to have the state stop doing business with the bank.”)

According to former North Dakota lawmaker Bette Grande “During the 2021 legislative session in North Dakota representatives of the lignite industry testified that coal operations are seeing increasing insurance premiums and a drop in the number of insurance companies willing to write insurance for any price. This is the ESG movement in action and it will not stop with oil and coal.”

Also in 2021 Sustainalytics an ESG business owned by Morningstar published a report titled How Sustainable Finance is Shaping Change in Banking. In the publication Sustainalytics notes:

Most major banks screen their lending portfolios against specific ESG risks as per the OECD Due Diligence guidance and many embrace negative or positive screening for potential corporate lending transactions or project finance transactions. Screening strategies filter potential transactions using predetermined ESG criteria to rule companies in or out of contention for financing. Negative screening and norm-based screening involve the exclusion or avoidance of transactions not aligned with environmental social and ethical standards. Exclusion criteria often include issues like weapon manufacturing tobacco sales or production of fossil fuels. While negative and norm-based screening are the most popular techniques used for ESG asset management these practices have been losing traction since 2015.

Positive screening on the other hand selects corporate borrowers that score highly on ESG factors relative to their peers. This can include best-in-class screening or the inclusion of investments in companies and sectors with higher ESG scores as compared to their peers or companies that are actively improving their ESG performance. This screening method does not necessarily exclude ESG laggards but rather focuses on those performing best with regards to ESG in relation to comparable companies or industries. In comparison to corporate lending transactions the intensity of screening is often higher for project finance transactions given due diligence requirements under the Equator Principles.

In 2020 Wells Fargo suspiciously closed a bank account belonging to Lauren Witzke a 2020 Republican candidate for the Delaware Senate.

The Heritage Foundation noted in a 2021 report that “PayPal has admitted to closing accounts flagged by the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2019 now PayPal has announced a partnership with the left-leaning Anti-Defamation League to focus on ‘further uncovering and disrupting the financial pipelines that support extremist and hate movements.'”

In 2019 the New York Post reported that J.P. Morgan Chase closed bank accounts associated with several political activists and commentators including Enrique Tarrio Joe Biggs Laura Loomer and Martina Markota—all within weeks of each other. According to the Post the activists said they were not given clear explanations for the cancellations.

In 2018 some large U.S. banks including Citibank rolled out restrictions for gun manufacturers and retailers. According to a report by the New York Times “They are restricting their credit card and banking services to gun retailers and halting lending to gun makers that do not comply with age limits and background check rules determined by the banks. They are also freezing out businesses that sell high-capacity magazines and ‘bump stocks’ attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire faster even though such products are legal under federal law.”

2. Credit Agencies Have Started to Alter Businesses’ Credit Ratings Based on ESG Scores

As noted in a 2021 sweeping report by Fitch Ratings—one of the “big three credit rating agencies” (along with Moody’s and S&P)—corporate credit rating agents already take ESG scores into account. And according to Fitch and others the use of ESG to alter credit ratings will almost certainly expand in the months and years to come.

If the largest agencies are willing to use ESG to alter corporate credit scores why wouldn’t credit agencies and banks do the same for individuals and small businesses?

3. Analysts Predict Individual Credit Scores Could Soon Have an ESG Component

Perhaps the most widely used service to check the creditworthiness of individuals and small business is FICO. When banks and credit unions examine applications for loans FICO is often the first place they turn. In an article published in December 2021 on FICO’s website titled “Lending Predictions 2022: From BNPL to ESG (and More)” a FICO senior principal consultant wrote that he believes in 2022 “The ESG Agenda Will Drive the Search for Cleaner Decisions.”

“In financial institutions much of the ESG agenda is delivered at the corporate level” the analyst wrote “but in 2022 we expect to see an increased focus on bringing ESG data into more granular lending and investment decisions. This will require increased innovation in the use of alternative data across all kinds of lending. One example would be the inclusion of property energy ratings data in mortgage valuation and decisioning and CO2 emission data for small businesses.”

He also noted “Over the longer term we expect that ESG and climate risk evaluations will become an integral element of credit risk and affordability assessments.”

This is a clear admission that ESG will likely soon be applied to individual and small business credit scores and/or other considerations such as mortgage applications.

4. Large Investment Management Firms and Banks Are Using ESG to Coerce Corporations

The primary stated purpose of ESG is to change corporations especially the largest and most powerful ones in order to produce more extensive societal impacts. This point is not in dispute. Everyone who understands ESG regardless of whether they support it or not agrees that it’s being used to alter corporate activities.

If you’re looking for specific examples of this however a good place to start is Larry Fink’s 2022 “Letter to CEOs” in which Fink sings the praises of “stakeholder capitalism” and promises to use ESG scores as a way to alter society. Fink is the head of Blackrock the world’s largest asset management company and is widely considered one of the most powerful people on Wall Street if not the most powerful person.

Of course Fink attempts to put a happy face on ESG and stakeholder capitalism throughout his letter but even he can’t help himself when discussing climate change making it clear that companies must choose between being leaders or being dragged into a net-zero economy against their will.

“Every company and every industry will be transformed by the transition to a net zero world” Fink wrote. “The question is will you lead or will you be led?”

The threats from Fink and others have largely worked. Accounting firm KPMG reports thousands of companies in dozens of countries have ESG systems in place including 82 percent of large companies in the United States. (And this data is now a couple of years old.)

If investors and banks are willing to utilize ESG to control corporations why wouldn’t they use ESG to manipulate individual and small business behavior as well?

5. Banks Have Promised to Use ESG to Fight Climate Change Throughout All of Their Portfolios and Business Activities

The largest and most influential banks and financial institutions in the United States much of Europe and Canada have openly said that they will use their tremendous amount of wealth to force the global economy to move to net-zero by at least 2050 and to halve CO2 emissions by 2030. This will be done in a variety of ways including by “accelerating decarbonization in the real economy by describing financial sector expectations of transition plans from the companies the sector engages with and finances.”

One of the largest groups of banks and financial institutions promising to make such an extreme acceleration is the Glasgow Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ). There are already “over 450 financial firms across 45 countries responsible for assets of over $130 trillion” in GFANZ including numerous large U.S. banks such as Bank of America J.P. Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo & Company.

There simply is no way for banks to keep their promises related to a transition to net-zero without imposing ESG metrics or other similar criteria on individuals and small businesses.

The measures were announced jointly as part of a new round of financial sanctions meant to ""hold Russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for (Russian President Vladimir) Putin."" The central bank restrictions target the more than $600 billion in reserves that the Kremlin has at its disposal meant to limit Russia's ability to support the ruble amid tightening Western sanctions. They also will severely constrain Russia's ability to import and export goods.

Cumulatively the steps taken by the West since Russia began the invasion would potentially amount to some of the toughest sanctions on any country in modern times.

U.S. officials said Saturday's steps were framed to send the ruble into ""free fall"" and promote soaring inflation in the Russian economy. They noted that previously announced sanctions have already had an impact on Russia bringing its currency to its lowest level against the dollar in history and giving its stock market the worst week on record.

Saturday's move includes cutting key Russian banks out of the SWIFT financial messaging system which daily moves countless billions of dollars around more than 11000 banks and other financial institutions around the world. The fine print of the sanctions was still being ironed out over the weekend officials said as they work to limit the impact of the restrictions on other economies and European purchases of Russian energy.

Allies on both sides of the Atlantic also considered the SWIFT option in 2014 when Russia invaded and annexed Ukraine's Crimea and backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. Russia declared then that kicking it out of SWIFT would be equivalent to a declaration of war. The allies — criticized ever after for responding too weakly to Russia's 2014 aggression — shelved the idea. Russia since then has tried to develop its own financial transfer system with limited success.

The U.S. has succeeded before in persuading the Belgium-based SWIFT system to kick out a country — Iran over its nuclear program. But kicking Russia out of SWIFT could also hurt other economies including those of the U.S. and key ally Germany.

The disconnection from SWIFT announced by the West on Saturday is partial leaving Europe and the United States room to escalate penalties further later.

Announcing the measures in Brussels EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said would push the bloc also to ""paralyze the assets of Russia's Central bank"" so that its transactions would be frozen. Cutting several commercial banks from SWIFT ""will ensure that these banks are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally"" she added.

""Cutting banks off will stop them from conducting most of their financial transactions worldwide and effectively block Russian exports and imports"" she added. ""Putin embarked on a path aiming to destroy Ukraine but what he is also doing in fact is destroying the future of his own country.""

Getting the EU on board for sanctioning Russia through SWIFT had been a tough process since EU trade with Russia amounted to 80 billion euros about 10 times as much as the United States which had been an early proponent of such measures.

Germany specifically had balked at the measure since it could hit them hard. But Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in a statement that ""after Russia's shameless attack ... we are working hard on limiting the collateral damage of decoupling (Russia) from SWIFT so that it hits the right people. What we need is a targeted functional restrictions of SWIFT.""

As another measure the allies announced a commitment ""to taking measures to limit the sale of citizenship — so-called golden passports — that let wealthy Russians connected to the Russian government become citizens of our countries and gain access to our financial systems.""

The group also announced the formation this week of a transatlantic task force to ensure that these and other sanctions on Russia are implemented effectively through information sharing and asset freezes.

Rachel Ziemba an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security said despite a complete SWIFT ban ""these measures will still be painful to Russia's economy. They reinforce the measures already taken earlier this week by making transactions more complicated and difficult.""

Ziemba says how much pain the sanctions render on the Russian economy will depend on which banks have been restricted and which measures are taken to restrict the ability of the Central Bank to operate.

""Regardless these sort of escalating sanctions removing banks from SWIFT restricting the Central Bank this will all make it more difficult to get commodities from Russia and will increase the pressure on the financial market."""

2022 has so far seen an explosion of true scam content—from Netflix’s Inventing Anna and The Tinder Swindler to Hulu’s upcoming Elizabeth Holmes series The Dropout to Apple TV+’s upcoming WeWork series WeCrashed. Starting this Sunday night Showtime is throwing its hat in the ring as well.

Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber based on the 2019 nonfiction book of the same name by tech reporter and author Mike Isaac tells the story of the rise and fall of Uber’s former CEO Travis Kalanick. Played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt the series follows his company from finding investors at its outset through scandal and crisis and up to Kalanick’s ultimate ousting in a boardroom coup. Season One helmed by Billions co-creators Brian Koppelman and David Levien also stars Kyle Chandler as Bill Gurley Hank Azaria as Tim Cook Uma Thurman as Arianna Huffington and Quentin Tarantino in a narrator role. The series has already been renewed as an anthology the second season of which will go inside the company culture at Facebook based upon another forthcoming book by Mike Isaac.

Jessica Brooks Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the tech bro founder.

The first episode of Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber airs on Showtime at 10pm ET on Sunday night with the rest of the season to follow suit each week for the next seven episodes. However the episodes will also be available on the app after midnight on the day that they air so you can also watch in the wee hours of Sunday morning if you so choose.

“Once we get them in our car we can charge whatever we want the next time.”

That’s the thesis of “Grow or Die” the caffeinated first episode of Super Pumped Showtime’s eight-episode limited series on the rideshare service Uber. It comes up first in the office of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) a practiced line worked into a fevered soliloquy about ride safety — an issue that irritates him right up until the moment he learns the company can make money off it. A variation of the line surfaces again in a flashback to 2011 when Travis is touting the “stickiness” of the service to Bill Gurley (Kyle Chandler) a venture capitalist with the resources and know-how to expand the business to a global scale. “If someone rides twice” says Travis “we have them for life.”

Travis is a master of a specific form of Silicon Valley jujitsu: Selling a consumer base of Bay Area progressives on ideas of liberation and disruption while Trojan-horsing rapacious capitalism. He’s a late-19th century robber baron in a charcoal sports jacket and expensive sneakers eager to exploit a consumer base that he’s mobilizing to destroy a preexisting business. (Or “space” in Silicon Valley-speak.) Bill later likens the service to a heroin dealer giving a free taste to a user to get him hooked and make money off his addiction later. He understands that cheap “frictionless” experiences for riders and fat incentives for drivers will cost him a fortune up front but eventually the rides will cost a fortune and drivers will have a much harder time making the nut. When Travis frets later about asking for more cash he needn’t have worried. Bill gets it.

The creators of Super Pumped Brian Koppelman and David Levien know the terrain well. Their long-running Showtime series Billions is about the brilliant minds and coarsened souls of Type-A sharks in sneakers and this show adapted from Mike Isaac’s book hums along at the same rarefied frequency. Like Damian Lewis’ Axe in Billions Travis is a charismatic animal who weaponizes his supreme self-confidence whether that means firing up the troops or bullying the regulators or other government officials who stand in his way. Koppelman and Levien also understand him as a confidence man not unlike Edward Norton’s card shark in their script for Rounders a slickster willing to cut every possible corner to get the win — only he doesn’t have the same raffish charm. He’s transparently a killer even as Gordon-Levitt provides him with a friendly face.

But he has to grow into being a killer and “Grow Or Die” is about that growth as much as it’s about turning a local outfit called Ubercab into the world-beating ride-sharing app known more simply as Uber. (Travis settling on the shorter name so closely mirrors the “Drop the ‘the’ it’s cleaner” scene in The Social Network that it feels like a deliberate hat tip.) The Travis who sweats over going to Bill for a fresh cash infusion is not yet the killer he would become but he has the initiative and he’s a quick study. The show frames him rather pitifully as a son locked in a rivalry with his firefighter brother Cory (Mishka Thébaud) over his parents’ approval and love. But that seems like another layer of skin that’s due for molting like one of Patrick Bateman’s facial masks in American Psycho.

The existential crisis facing Travis in this major inflection point for Ubercab is a fight with Randall Pearson (Richard Schiff) the city’s transportation head who’s deep in the pockets of taxi and livery business. Pearson wants to protect the powerful cab business from a serious existential threat of its own and Super Pumped isn’t any keener to make him look like a knight in shining armor as Billions is to make Paul Giamatti’s Chuck in a crusading district attorney. Travis implies not without reason that Pearson is too ethically compromised to referee this fight. And Travis is also wagering with that aggressive self-confidence of his that Uber is the future and taxicabs are a horse-and-buggy system standing in the way of progress.

With Pearson hitting Ubercab with massive fines and cease-and-desist orders Travis and his team has to get creative. And in a true faux-progressive Bay Area scheme he decides to turn his customers into activists. The mayor may not want to listen to a smug visionary out to crush an established business but he might listen to voters who make their voices heard in pyramid boxes of petitions and in an organized demonstration outside City Hall. Travis is an excellent talker and salesman and he pitches to the ego of a mayor who doesn’t want to be on the wrong side of history. “The city has been taken!” he screams in triumph after he’s won proof that open offices exist in part for all-hands applauding of the CEO.

“Grow or Die” ends with the introduction of another major character Emil Michael (Babak Tafti) who Bill foists into Travis’s inner circle after bailing out the company. Emil proves himself to his suspicious new boss by calmly assessing the fines Ubercab still owes the city and suggesting that maybe the company isn’t in the cab business at all since those fines were issued by cab regulators. Hence the euphemism “ridesharing.” Hence the name Uber. The confidence man slips the trap.

Off The Meter

• The “dun-colored mare” reference comes from J.D. Salinger’s two-novella anthology Raise High the Roof Beam Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction. It’s from a Taoist story-within-a-story about the search for a “superlative horse one that raises no dust and leaves no tracks.” The searcher Kao seeks the essential: “Intent on the inward qualities he loses sight of the external. Anyway Travis’s girlfriend is right that Travis will be fine wearing the same nondescript-yet-expensive garb as every other founder in Silicon Valley.

• The company that made Kalanick wary of investor-founder relationships — as dramatized in that scene with former Hollywood titan Michael Ovitz (John Michael Higgins) — is Scour a pre-Napster file-sharing service that turned to Ovitz for investment and wound up on the losing end of a breach-of-contract lawsuit.

• That story Travis tells about LeBron James taking the bus from the projects to turn down a $10 million check from Reebok because he understood his value is mostly true save for the bus part. James tells the story on an episode of Uninterrupted’s Kneading Dough podcast and says he flew out for the meeting. It’s in character for Travis to tweak the story to make it that much more dramatic.

• What a joy to see Kerry Bishé co-star of the brilliant Halt and Catch Fire return to the tech-TV space here as a manager of driver relations.

• Comparisons to The Social Network may be inevitable but this series (and Travis’s rogue operation) owes much more to The Wolf of Wall Street.

• The song that closes the show “First We Take Manhattan” is an R.E.M. cover of a Leonard Cohen song. It’s a deeeeeeeep cut for devotees of R.E.M. who covered it for the Cohen tribute album I’m Your Fan. Koppelman is just such a devotee.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vNjE1MTQ3Ny9zdXBlci1wdW1wZWQtYmF0dGxlLWZvci11YmVyLXRydWUtc3Rvcnkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The True Story Behind 'Super Pumped: The Battle For Uber',"Throughout the Showtime anthology series Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber premiering Feb. 27 the ride-share company’s former CEO Travis Kalanick (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is compared to cult leader David Koresh. Mike Isaac the author of the titular 2019 book that inspired the eight-episode series doesn’t recall any of his sources equating the embattled one-time Uber boss with the man who played a central role in the 1993 Waco massacre. But he admits it’s an apt comparison if not a compliment.

“In Silicon Valley ‘cult’ is not a dirty word” says The New York Times tech reporter who has been covering Uber since 2014. (He’s also an executive producer on Super Pumped as well as the show’s resident researcher and fact-checker.) “If you think about it most startups fail. Everyone is pretty much rooting against you. The person at the head of the company has to be a true believer in what they’re doing.”

Beyond just believing in Uber’s potential Kalanick was committed to its mission to a fault. The series created by Billions’ Brian Koppelman and David Levien shows how Kalanick’s blind faith in himself and the company he co-founded in 2009 drove his success but also led to his demise. In 2017 Kalanick resigned as Uber’s CEO amid a myriad of scandals that included allegations of workplace discrimination and sexual harassment under his leadership. (He remained on Uber’s board of directors until 2019 the same year the company went public.)

Yet Super Pumped never paints Kalanick as a mustache-twirling villain. Instead it offers an unvarnished look at the man Isaac once called “Mark Zuckerberg meets a can of Axe Body Spray.” “Travis is a complicated nuanced flawed person who fought like hell to bring this industry to light” Isaac says. “But schadenfreude is real. I think people like stories in which aspirational figures fly too close to the sun. Travis did that too.”

Below the author helps fact-check the series that looks at the rise and fall of Kalanick as he built one of Silicon Valley’s most successful—and destructive—companies.

Did Travis Kalanick really start off every Uber job interview by asking ‘Are you an a–hole’?

When viewers first meet Travis he’s asking a prospective new hire a very important question: “Are you an a–hole?” The takeaway is that nice guys finish last at Uber. So if you want to work there you better answer “yes” to his query. Isaac doesn’t believe Kalanick or anyone else who worked for the company ever said those words.

“The recruiters probably had enough self-awareness to not ask ‘Are you an a–hole’ in a job interview” he says. “But they definitely made it clear to people that this was not play time this was a tough job a daily fight. If you wanted to sign up at Uber you had to know what you’re getting into.”

Super Pumped uses the provocative question to foreshadow the pitfalls of Kalanick’s overly aggressive leadership style. He could get away with being a bit of an a–hole back when he was a David taking on Silicon Valley’s Goliaths. But once Uber became the company to beat he couldn’t continue acting like a scrappy upstart. “The best CEOs change and mature over time” Isaac says. “They are able to take guidance from mentors and change the way the company operates but I think Travis really only had one mode which was ‘go as hard as possible.’ Had he been able to drastically change how he operated maybe he would still be there.”

Did Uber create a tool that secretly denied service to riders?

Fred Armisen in 'Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber' Elizabeth Morris/SHOWTIME

In episode 2 Travis and his team launch “Greyball” a secret program that punishes riders that the company deems persona non grata by forcing them to schedule “ghost cars” instead of real ones. “It’s like a video game and we have the cheat code” Travis says giddily as he watches a transportation agent hellbent on shutting down the company’s operation in Portland OR. (played by Fred Armisen) fail to book a ride.

In 2017 Isaac broke the story of Greyball for The New York Times. He says the “paranoid tool” used data collected from the Uber app to evade authorities in cities like Boston Paris and Las Vegas as well as countries like China Australia and South Korea. As early as 2014 the company started using the tool which was part of a program called VTOS short for “violation of terms of service.” Greyball had been approved by Uber’s legal team but in 2017 the United States Department of Justice launched an inquiry into the legality of it based on Isaac’s reporting.

At the time of Isaac’s story Uber claimed the tool “denies ride requests to users who are violating our terms of service — whether that’s people aiming to physically harm drivers competitors looking to disrupt our operations or opponents who collude with officials on secret ‘stings’ meant to entrap drivers.” Less than one week later Uber said it would review how the technology was being used but would “expressly prohibit its use to target action by local regulators going forward.”

Did venture capitalist Bill Gurley make an enemy of Travis Kalanick after implying Uber was a “dead unicorn”?

In episode 3 Uber board member Bill Gurley (Kyle Chandler) sits down with a journalist (Isaac making his acting debut) at the South by Southwest conference and takes aim at the ride-sharing company. When asked whether he thinks Silicon Valley is in a “tech bubble” Bill says “I think we’re in a risk bubble especially with these so-called unicorns” a term used to describe startup companies like Uber that have a valuation of over $1 billion. He then says that some of those unicorns are “acting irrationally” and there “isn’t enough fear in Silicon Valley” before adding “I think you will see some dead unicorns this year.” His comments result in Travis revoking his all-access privileges to the Uber office.

At the 2015 SXSW festival Gurley did suggest without naming any names that there would be some “dead unicorns” in the near future. The partner at the venture capital firm Benchmark has a reputation for being a pessimist—Kalanick called him “Chicken Little” behind his back according to Isaac—but his statements raised eyebrows. “What he said definitely applied to Uber. It was subtly or not so subtly aimed at them” Isaac says. “People on the inside at Uber felt that too. That it wasn’t an accident that he’s saying this stuff.”

Gurley didn’t lose his key card for what he said—though he would later have the electronic pass taken away for unspecified reasons—but it may have foreshadowed the fallout to come. While Gurley and Kalanick seemed simpatico at first the combo of the young CEO’s shenanigans and the veteran VC’s worries didn’t make for a good marriage. “By the end they weren’t talking to each other at all directly. They had to have intermediaries” Isaac says. It’s Gurley who reportedly spearheaded the call for Kalanick to resign in 2017 enacting a coup of sorts. One day after Kalanick stepped down as CEO Gurley left Uber’s board of directors.

Did a former Uber employee write a viral blog post about worker discrimination over a leather jacket?

In episode 5 a site reliability engineer (SRE) named Susan Fowler gets to lay out the toxic culture that permeates the Uber workplace by detailing her own experience at the company. On her first day she says she was sexually harassed by her superior. When she reported the incident to Marie in HR she was told to switch teams so she wouldn’t have to work with her harasser who was likely to give her a poor performance review if she stayed. While her new boss wasn’t a pervert he wasn’t interested in giving her the promotion she deserved—or the leather jacket that all SREs were promised but was only given to the men. After leaving the company she wrote a blog post detailing her “very very strange year at Uber.”

The allegations above were covered in detail in Fowler’s February 2017 blog post including the leather jacket debacle. Fowler claimed that the six female SREs on staff received a “comically absurd” email from her director saying the company could not justify placing a jacket order for so few women at such a high cost. When she rebuffed his excuse “the director replied back saying that if we women really wanted equality then we should realize we were getting equality by not getting the leather jackets.”

“To Susan’s absolute credit [her blog] blew the lid off the long simmering issues of dysfunction inside of Uber and Silicon Valley” Isaac says. Her speaking out led to some quick changes: Uber launched an independent investigation into its workplace culture Kalanick resigned and the company ousted at least 20 other employees for sexual misconduct. It’s easy to forget that Fowler’s blog went live eight months before the #MeToo movement started. “Susan’s story was kind of a precursor to a really large movement that would hit across the country and across the world later that year” Isaac says. “Her blog was enormous in The Valley but it was really part of a continuum that would take off after the Harvey Weinstein allegations.”

In 2017 Fowler was named Time’s Person of the Year alongside other “silence breakers” including Taylor Swift Ashley Judd and activist Tarana Burke who coined the term #MeToo. Three years later Fowler released her memoir Whistleblower: My Journey to Silicon Valley and Fight for Justice at Uber.

Was Arianna Huffington like a mother to Travis Kalanick?

In episode 4 Travis meets the Huffington Post co-founder played by Uma Thurman at a contentious tech conference. He finds a much-needed ally in Arianna just as his relationship with Gurley begins to sour. She shows him how to center himself through meditation and becomes a board member he can count on when he feels outnumbered. She sticks with him through the most tumultuous of times for the company and later becomes a mother figure to Travis after his mom (Elisabeth Shue) dies in a tragic boating accident.

The cozy relationship viewers see on screen was true to real life. “I think Arianna was very important to him” Isaac says. “She was on his side at a time when he was losing friends and making enemies.” After his mom died unexpectedly in 2017 Huffington became “an emotionally supportive figure during the most stirring periods of his entire life” Isaac says.

After Susan Fowler accused the company of sexual discrimination and harassment in 2017 Huffington was put in charge of the independent investigation into Uber’s workplace culture a questionable move considering her close relationship with Kalanick. Amid the investigation she also became the face of Kalanick’s redemption tour telling CNBC in June 2017 that through self-care he would become a better leader. “So first Travis started recognizing how differently he made decisions when he had gotten enough sleep” she said. “And then he started meditating.”

Her guidance would prove inconsequential; Kalanick would resign as CEO that same month. Two years later Huffington resigned from Uber’s board seemingly unscathed. “What I really admire about her is she always seems to be able to see around corners and know what’s coming” Isaac says. “That’s why she’s made it so far she’s basically Teflon.”

Did a viral video of Travis Kalanick yelling at an Uber driver end his career?

In episode 5 viewers meet Fawzi Kamel an Uber driver who was verbally harassed by Travis after taking him home from a club. The altercation was caught on his dash cam but Fawzi is torn as to whether he should release it. He doesn’t want to punish Kalanick for having a bad day and doesn’t want to lose his job. He only decides to release the clip after learning that Travis plans to invest in self-driving cars.

The real Kamel who had been driving for Uber since 2011 was taking Kalanick home in February 2017 when he confronted the CEO over lowered fares that made it hard for him to make a living wage. Instead of showing empathy for his employee Kalanick went on the defensive. ​​“Some people don’t like to take responsibility for their own sh-t” he says in the clip. “They blame everything in their life on somebody else.”

At the time Kamel told NBC News that he released the footage because he wanted to show how little Kalanick cared about his workforce. “Uber kept dropping prices every season to gain more ridership to satisfy their growth and it didn’t matter to Uber if the driver is not even making minimum wage” he said in February 2017. “And the worst part is they call us partners [but] they make the rules set the price and they even choose the cars you can use.”

In his book Isaac writes that the viral video led Kalanick to have an “epic meltdown” that had him questioning his character. “You aren’t a terrible person” a member of Kalanick’s PR team allegedly told him. “But you do do terrible things.” Kalanick apologized to Kamel and reportedly later met with him in person to say he was sorry. But the video which came one week after Fowler’s viral blog post became just another example of the CEO’s questionable leadership style. “I think the video really showed a lack of regard for the people who make his service” Isaac says. “It became difficult for him to survive if the public thought he didn’t care about his drivers. It was definitely one of the last nails in the coffin.”

Kalanick may no longer be at Uber but he’s planning a comeback with a new startup called CloudKitchens which rents out space to restaurants for delivery-only services. He claims it will be “bigger than Uber.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy91YmVyLWZvdW5kZXItdHJhdmlzLWthbGFuaWNrLXNvbGQtMjIwMDAwMTkyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber Founder Travis Kalanick Sold His Stake For $2.8 Billion In 2019,"Uber founder and CEO Travis Kalanick has a pretty intense story and it’s getting the on-screen treatment in a new Showtime series called Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber.

The trailer promises all kinds of juicy nuggets like people saying that Travis is “willing to run through walls to win” and a group of people cracking up when someone asks if what they’re doing is legal.

Cue all kinds of scenes of people partying Travis (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) sauntering past a private jet and at one point shouting “My life is on the line here. And all of you—you’ll bleed for it!”

The whole thing is based on a true story but ya know some exact dialogue is made up. It’s only natural after seeing all that to wonder where exactly Travis is RN. Here’s what you need to know.

Travis is no longer at Uber.

Travis was kicked out of Uber in 2017 after all kinds of complaints surfaced about the company’s culture workplace issues and treatment of its riders and drivers per CNBC.

He left the company’s board on December 24 to “focus on his new business and philanthropic endeavors” the company told CNBC.

Travis made plenty of money after his departure though. He started selling some of his Uber shares in 2019 and ended up making an impressive $2.8 billion from that alone CNBC says.

His net worth is around $2.7 billion dollars.

Though he's no longer at the top of Uber Travis remains wealthy. He's worth $2.7 billion according to Forbes.

And according to Business Insider he was relatively ""cash-poor for a billionaire."" But his liquid assets saw a boost after he sold $1.4 billion in Uber shares to Japanese tech giant SoftBank.

After Travis left Uber he launched a venture fund.

Travis went on to launch CloudKitchens a company that rents space to restaurateurs for delivery-based businesses. He spent $130 million to launch the company according to Business Insider.

He’s now CEO of another company.

Right now you can find Travis acting as CEO of City Storage Systems a holding company that redevelops “distressed” real estate per Forbes.

He’s got some swanky real estate.

Travis spent $36.5 million in August 2019 on a penthouse in New York City’s SoHo neighborhood that comes complete with a pool and rooftop deck according to The New York Times. At the time it was the most expensive home sold in New York that month.

The next year Travis dropped a cool $43.3 million on a seven-bedroom mansion in Los Angeles with two pools according to The Wall Street Journal. So he's doing OK in the real estate game.

Travis recently split with his model girlfriend.

In 2021 Travis dated Victoria’s Secret model Daniela Lopez Osorio according to Page Six. “Travis has been dating Daniela since mid-January but they have been trying to keep it very quiet” a source told Page Six last year.

Alas their relationship didn't last. Daniela recently posted a cozy video with actor Bryan Craig.

But unlike Hulu’s adaptation of The Dropout or Apple’s forthcoming WeWork series which both focus on the creators of services that have largely fallen out of the public’s favor Super Pumped revolves around a product many people watching the series still use despite the high-profile scandals associated with it.

Adapted from Mike Isaac’s 2019 book of the same name Super Pumped details former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick’s (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) meteoric rise to fame and eventual ousting from the company in 2017 amid rising concerns about sexual harassment in the workplace deceiving drivers about wages user privacy violations and a cavalcade of other problems. Though these and other pieces of Uber’s history have already been unpacked through multiple years’ worth of reporting Super Pumped presents them all as fresh puzzle pieces that fit together to form a picture depicting Kalanick as an embodiment of everything that can make unicorn founders as successful as they are reviled.

Kalanik speaking in front of a crowd. Showtime

The idea that being an abrasive asshole (the show’s words) is key to making it in Silicon Valley is something Super Pumped’s Kalanick readily shares with most anyone who’ll talk to him as the series opens on at a time when Uber was already logging over 1 million rides a day. Despite Uber being well past its days of being a startup Super Pumped’s Kalanick can’t pull himself out of that scrappy upstart kind of mindset even as those closest to him like his girlfriend Angie (Annie Chang) and his mother Bonnie (Elizabeth Shue) repeatedly remind him that he’s playing a different game at that point in his career. From Kalanick’s perspective hustling is a founder’s default state of being and anyone foolish enough to disagree with him is simply an annoyance destined for dismissal both from his company and his life.

Kalanick’s sees hustling as a founder’s default state of being

Super Pumped does not shine a light on the secrets of Kalanick’s success as much as it — similar to what The Dropout does with Elizabeth Holmes — illustrates how Kalanick and other figures like him are themselves products of an industry that loves self-aggrandizing mythmakers. Everything Kalanick does and all the airs he puts on are part of his plans to impress power players like venture capitalist Bill Gurley (Kyle Chandler) who he knows hold the keys to unlocking doors to even greater levels of success. Wild as Kalanick’s plans often are Uber co-founder Garrett Camp (Jon Bass) Uber’s former chief business officer Emil Michael (Babak Tafti) and Uber’s former head of strategy Austin Geidt (Kerry Bishé) willingly follow his lead because they believe in his process and understand his madness to be a part of it.

Of Kalanick’s many personal relationships Super Pumped frames his with Gurley as being the most crucial to understanding Uber’s story even though Gurley’s influence over the company gradually begins to wane. The series details how the friction between the two men — small at first but ever-growing — was a fixture within Uber that became emblematic of Kalanick’s larger approach to presenting himself and his application to hail ersatz cabs as the Second Coming. Because Super Pumped doesn’t presume that you know all of the ins and outs of Uber’s story it attempts to lay them all out in painstaking detail like the book it’s based on and it’s for this reason that the show often feels like a bit of a slog in its first few episodes.

Super Pumped knows that its scenes zooming in on the Uber team hammering out system bugs and chasing stodgy venture capitalists’ money-lined skirts aren’t especially interesting in and of themselves. So the show attempts to stylistically amp things up with a torrent of on-screen text cutaway gags and moments of bombastic narration from Quentin Tarantino of all people. That and a handful of moments in which people break the fourth wall make Super Pumped feel like it’s trying to be something akin to The Wolf of Wall Street.

Super Pumped’s prioritization of so-so style over substance wouldn’t be so much of an issue were it not for the very serious subject matter the show eventually gets around to focusing on. It’s when Super Pumped draws lines between points like Gurley’s concerns about Uber’s spending Kalanick’s desire to throw drug-field parties because they supposedly energize workers and Uber’s gender imbalance within its ranks that the show feels like it’s found its voice. Uber’s problem the show posits wasn’t just that many of its male employees felt comfortable harassing their female colleagues but that Kalanick and his right-hand people all enabled that sort of behavior under the auspices of trying to foster a very specific culture of sexist camaraderie within the company.

Super Pumped tried to amp things up with narration from Quentin Tarantino

It’s not until Super Pumped has introduced all of its characters including Arianna Huffington (Uma Thurman) and Tim Cook (Hank Azaria) that the show properly kicks into gear because of the important roles they play in Kalanick’s fate as Uber’s CEO. By the time Super Pumped makes that shift though it’s already spent so much time hyperfocused on Kalanick’s paranoia and increasingly erratic behavior that one could easily assume the show doesn’t know how to wrap itself up succinctly.

It’s fair to say that Super Pumped which is an anthology series is a bit heavy on the backend in a way that makes this first season feel uneven more often than not but the show may fare much better the next time around with its story about Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg."

Washington posed in a yellow dress with a 70s style blowout and in the second image within the carousel converted the shot to black and white and featured it alongside a picture of Beverly Johnson herself.

Next up was her depiction of Olympian Wilma Rudolph. Washington sports Rudolph’s signature short crop with a wig a USA athletic fleece and a gold medal around her neck symbolizing just one of “The Black Gazelle’s” three.

“YEP. She wasn’t the first Black athlete or the first female athlete to win three gold medals” Kerry wrote. “She was the first ATHLETE. Wilma ran (literally!) so that Black athletes and Olympians could run too. And show the world our magic our talents and our determination. Thank you Wilma!!!!!”

In what just may be the final installation in the actress’ Instagram installation Washington honored none other than civil rights legend Rosa Parks in what looks like her most elaborate costume yet. The Emmy award winner wears a plaid blazer glasses and an iteration of a dutch braid in the same style Rosa Parks was photographed in in her 1955 mugshot.

“A lot of people think that Rosa’s activism started with her refusing to give up her seat on the bus” she captioned the image. “But she lived a life of activism long before that. Fighting boycotting marching and even working as an investigator for the NAACP advocating against sexual assaults on Black women.”

Ten of them will be bound for North Platte’s Bailey Yard as the railroad evaluates the technology for future long-haul use U.P. spokeswoman Robynn Tysver told The Telegraph.

The combined purchases and upgrades to yard infrastructure are expected to exceed $100 million representing the largest investment in battery-electric technology by a U.S. Class I railroad.

The locomotives will be acquired from Progress Rail a Caterpillar company and Wabtec Corp. two companies at the forefront of locomotive innovation.

They will form the world’s largest carrier-owned battery-electric locomotive fleet in freight service U.P. said in a Jan. 28 press release.

“We’re committed to actions that reduce Union Pacific’s environmental footprint as we work toward our ultimate goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050” said Lance Fritz the railroad’s chairman president and CEO.

“These investments will contribute to further developing this important technology and providing industry-wide benefits.”

Union Pacific expects the first units to arrive in late 2023 with complete delivery by late 2024.

They’ll be tested in California and Nebraska yards in cold and warm weather helping identify the locomotives’ capabilities and challenges for broader deployment.

Battery-electric locomotives do not use fuel and emit zero emissions. For every 10 battery-electric locomotives used U.P. says approximately 4000 tons of carbon will be eliminated annually.

That would be the equivalent of removing 800 cars from the highway the railroad said in its press release.

By working with their manufacturers U.P. said the railroad hopes to advance battery-electric technology and evaluate its potential deployment in long-haul service.

Union Pacific published its first comprehensive Climate Action Plan in December 2021 outlining its efforts to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions within its operations.

As part of that commitment the railroad says it will reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions 26% by 2030 and achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

Scope 1 emissions come from sources “controlled or owned by an organization” according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Scope 2 emissions are more indirect and “associated with the purchase of electricity steam heat or cooling” the EPA says.

The Port of Los Angeles which recently received an EPA Diesel Emission Reduction Act grant gave Union Pacific a subaward that will partially cover the cost of one battery-electric locomotive.

“Our work with the Port of Los Angeles will help us cut emissions in the South Coast Air Basin which includes four counties in Southern California” said Beth Whited executive vice president and chief human resource officer who oversees Union Pacific’s ESG efforts.

“This work also will help our customers realize the benefit of moving goods by rail reducing emissions by up to 75%.”

Presented in association with Round Room Live the exhibition is an immersive and interactive experience that features previously unseen film photos and the display of more than 150 historical artifacts and personal effects on loan from the Mandela family museums and archives worldwide.

“Nelson Mandela: The Official Exhibition” is designed to educate entertain and inspire using many personal belongings and objects never previously seen outside of South Africa.

Several events are planned around the exhibition. Go to durhammuseum.org for more information.

Main Street at Red Cloud

The Smithsonian’s Museum on Main Street — in cooperation with Humanities Nebraska — is showing “Crossroads: Change in Rural America” at the National Willa Cather Center in Red Cloud Nebraska.

The exhibition examines the evolving landscape of rural America and will be on view through March 31 at the Red Cloud Opera House Gallery.

The vast majority of the United States landscape remains rural with only 3.5% of the landmass considered urban. However since 1900 the percentage of Americans living in rural areas dropped from 60% to 17%. The exhibition looks at that remarkable societal change and how rural Americans responded.

The exhibit moves to McCook and Chadron from Red Cloud: specifics and dates can be found at humanitiesnebraska.org/programs/museum-on-main-street/crossroads/.

With the support and guidance of state humanities councils host towns will develop complementary exhibits host public programs and facilitate educational initiatives to raise people’s understanding about their own history the joys and challenges of living rural how change has impacted their community and prompt discussion of goals for the future.

“‘Crossroads’ allows us to reflect on Red Cloud’s history present and future and we are excited to explore what the future may hold for our community” said Tracy Tucker Education Director and Archivist at the NWCC. “We want to convene conversations about what makes our community unique and have developed local exhibitions and public programs to complement the Smithsonian exhibition.”

The exhibit is free of charge. For more information go to willacather.org.

Job-readiness program started

A new job-readiness program the CB Tech Career Acceleration Program will launch in Council Bluffs in 2022.

It will help underemployed individuals living below the poverty line develop career skills to land lucrative jobs in the area’s growing technology sector. There will be a focus on members of its Latino community.

The AIM Institute in partnership with the Council Bluffs Area Chamber of Commerce Centro Latino of Iowa and Iowa Western Community College has secured a $50000 grant from Google to support the program which is designed to promote greater diversity equity and inclusion in the local tech industry.

According to the latest available U.S. Census Bureau data the poverty rate in Council Bluffs is 12.8% with an average per capita income of $27051 – more than $7000 below the U.S. average ($34103). After completion of the new CB Tech Career Acceleration program participants will emerge with qualifications needed for job placement as front-end web developers a career with an average entry-level salary of more than $55000 according to ZipRecruiter.

Changes on Goodwill Board

Goodwill Omaha has announced changes to its board of trustees for 2022.

Doug Anderson chief operating officer Harvest Development Omaha at Percipio Partners is now the chair. He joined Goodwill’s board in 2019.

“I have worked closely with him the past couple months and he’s a strong advocate for Goodwill and a great supporter of our employment programs” said Tobi Mathouser president and CEO at Goodwill Omaha.

In December Mark Stokes a longtime trustee of Goodwill Omaha departed the board after nine years. Stokes was the board chair in 2017 during which he provided consistent leadership and stability in the restructuring of the organization and efforts to reinforce the agency’s foundation.

Goodwill Omaha honored Stokes at its Celebrate Good Gala in November. Jim Rich Goodwill Omaha’s board chair in 2020 and 2021 also was honored. He remains on the board in the role of chair emeritus and is now a member of Goodwill Omaha’s investment committee.

The board recently welcomed two new trustees: last fall Aaron Johnson a partner at Baird Holm LLP and in January Juan Padilla community development manager at Canopy South a nonprofit helping to revitalize neighborhoods in South Omaha.

Tuition reset at Brownell Talbot

Brownell Talbot College Preparatory School has announced that beginning with the 2022-2023 school year its high school tuition will be reset at $15000 down from $22560 this year.

By resetting tuition at a price competitive to other Omaha private school options BT is removing the primary barrier to enrollment enabling more Omaha families to give their children a rigorous globally minded education the school said in a release.

This is the first time in the school’s 158-year history that tuition has been dramatically reduced.

“All of the high-quality elements that distinguish a BT education — faculty at the top of their field; outstanding globally focused academics; superior college placements; and robust athletics activities and arts programs — will remain as strong as they’ve been in the past” Head of School Kristi N. Gibbs said. “BT will continue to enroll academically minded students who have enthusiasm for and motivation toward maximizing their educational opportunities.

The only thing that is changing is a tuition model that no longer works for BT’s Upper School.”

Brownell Talbot Upper School is the top ranked high school in Nebraska as determined by Niche.com. In 2022 it was chosen as the best private high school in Nebraska for the second year in a row. It also ranked first for best high school for STEM and first place best private K-12 school in Nebraska.

Early childhood panel chosen

The Buffett Early Childhood Institute at the University of Nebraska has chosen 26 early childhood professionals from across the state for the inaugural Nebraska Early Childhood Workforce Leadership Cadre.

Dreamweaver connects seniors

Dreamweaver Foundation a Nebraska-based nonprofit announced an expanded partnership with GrandPad bringing its Connecting Hope program to meet the needs of seniors across the U.S. and Puerto Rico.

Providing isolated and lonely seniors with a GrandPad tablet has resulted in hundreds of strengthened and meaningful ties to family friends and caregivers through this senior-friendly technology.

“One of our GrandPad recipients contacted us recently to share her heartfelt gratitude for our help during one of the most difficult times of her life. She couldn’t imagine going through COVID-19 her husband’s illness and recent passing without her GrandPad from Dreamweaver Foundation. She didn’t feel so alone and could be in touch with her family. This is exactly why we work to provide GrandPad tablets to seniors in need” said Cheri Mastny executive director of Dreamweaver Foundation.

Protein given to Food Bank

A unique partnership with United Rentals and Omaha Steaks meant a truckload of protein for Food Bank for the Heartland.

To thank their employees for their hard work last year United Rentals provided each of its employees a cooler of Omaha Steaks packed with a variety of proteins.

United Rentals gave their employees the option to donate their Omaha Steaks package to a local charity and 140 employees decided to donate their gifts of protein to Food Bank for the Heartland.

When Omaha Steaks a Nebraska-based 105-year-old family-owned company learned about United Rentals’ employees donating their holiday meal to charity Omaha Steaks decided to match that donation bringing the total to 280 protein packages.

Omaha Steaks delivered a truckload containing more than 5000 servings of protein to Food Bank for the Heartland that include an assortment of steaks chicken pork all-beef franks seafood sides and desserts.

“At Omaha Steaks serving others is at the very core of who we are from serving our customers to serving our communities” said Todd Simon fifth-generation family owner of Omaha Steaks.

Even as Putin’s tanks and troops stormed through Ukraine Gabbard 40 urged President Biden to meet with the ex-KBG strongman during an exclusive interview at the Conservative Political Action Conference where she was a guest speaker.

“As leaders you have to be willing to have a dialogue and conversation to address the real issues at hand” Gabbard said. “There is always a path for diplomacy. What is the alternative? The alternative then is continued escalation.

“Putin has said for years his security concerns are about NATO increasingly approaching and surrounding Russia on all sides” Gabbard continued. “The Biden administration has failed to outline for the American people how does this serve your best interests? What will the costs be?”

4 “As leaders you have to be willing to have a dialogue and conversation to address the real issues at hand” Gabbard said. Stephen Yang for NY Post

The position has earned the former congresswoman widespread ire from critics on both the left and the right.

“As recently as last week he once again demanded NATO leave every country that joined after 1997 including Bulgaria Romania & 12 others. After weeks of posturing Putin launched a full scale invasion of the country Wednesday evening and has been condemned by Biden and leaders around the world” Florida GOP senator Marco Rubio said in a tweet responding to Gabbard.

“I even think your pals at CPAC disagree with this psychotic take” added Nomiki Konst a former progressive candidate for New York City Public Advocate.

4 “There is always a path for diplomacy” Gabbard said. Stephen Yang for NY Post

The ex-congresswoman shrugged off her critics.

“They are not living in the real world” she said claiming fears of Putin establishing the old Soviet empire were unfounded.

Since the fall of the Soviet Union the United States has moved aggressively to expand the NATO alliance into the the eastern bloc nations of the old Soviet sphere of influence. Once Communist dominated nations like Poland Hungary and Romania are now within the alliance. The issue has long chaffed at Putin who has called the breakup of the Soviet Empire a “tragedy.”

Gabbard — a former 2020 presidential candidate and one-time vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee — cut a curious figure at the Orlando confab where she greeted fans who have grown accustomed to seeing her now regular appearances in conservative media.

A longtime liberal Democrat Gabbard was pro-choice and supported gun control environmental regulations and universal health care during her presidential campaign. The American Conservative Union — which sponsors the annual conference — offered here a paltry 9% rating on their 2020 scorecard.

She was invited to the annual gathering by longtime CPAC boss Matt Schlaap and given a coveted speaking spot during the event’s Ronald Reagan dinner on Friday.

“I think it’s important that we have conversations whether they’re with people from our political party or people from a different political party” Gabbard said touting her bipartisan bonafides.

Though she remains a Democrat and endorsed Joe Biden for president over Donald Trump Gabbard has since become a ferocious critic of the president.

“I am very disappointed with the decisions and the policies he put forward as president. His whole platform was based around trying to unite the American people and unfortunately he’s not only not carried out that promise but so many of his policies have been divisive.”

The gadfly Hawaiian declined to offer any 2024 speculation. She’s working on a book and hasn’t ruled out getting involved in the midterm elections later this year. She might even be voting Republican.

“I have always been of the mindset that the interest of the country and the American people should come first before any political partisan interests” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbXBhcmFibHkuY29tL25ld3MvNy10aXBzLWZvci1kZXZlbG9waW5nLWFuLWF0dHJhY3RpdmUtd29yay1jdWx0dXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Tips for Developing an Attractive Work Culture,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.comparably.com/news/7-tips-for-developing-an-attractive-work-culture/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbXBhcmFibHkuY29tL25ld3MvNy10aXBzLWZvci1kZXZlbG9waW5nLWFuLWF0dHJhY3RpdmUtd29yay1jdWx0dXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdHJpYnVuZS5jb20ucGsvc3RvcnkvMjM0NTI5Ni9wbS1hY2NvcmRzLXByaW9yaXR5LXRvLWhlYWx0aC1yZWxhdGVkLXByb2plY3Rz0gFZaHR0cHM6Ly90cmlidW5lLmNvbS5way9zdG9yeS8yMzQ1Mjk2L3BtLWFjY29yZHMtcHJpb3JpdHktdG8taGVhbHRoLXJlbGF0ZWQtcHJvamVjdHM_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PM accords priority to health-related projects,"Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday directed the implementation of measures regarding the ongoing health-related projects on a priority basis in order to facilitate the common man.

Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr Faisal Sultan and provincial ministers Dr Yasmeen Rashid and Taimur Saleem Jhagra were in attendance.

Premier Imran said “The poor and the middle class will be the biggest beneficiaries of the health card as such universal health coverage system is not even available in several developed countries.”

The prime minister was informed about the progress regarding provision of health facilities and the ongoing projects at the federal government level and in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.

It was highlighted that a large number of people in Punjab and K-P were benefiting from free healthcare facilities.

The meeting discussed that the government was launching a programme to control stunted growth in children particularly in the rural districts of the country.

It was emphasised that in order to improve maternal and child health an across-the-board monitoring of the child's health would be carried out right from birth.

It was informed that the government would ensure the capacity building of the nursing sector through training of international standard.

The prime minister was briefed that due to the effective measures taken by the government the rate of general vaccination of citizens had increased from 66 to 76 per cent.

Also in Punjab the rate of general vaccination had touched over 91 per cent which was being recognised internationally.

In addition the targets for Covid-19 vaccination are also being set.

Medical personnel especially in Nigeria and other developing countries need to update their skills regularly to meet up with ever-changing medical issues ranging from disease mutations and advancements in preventive and curative medicine.

The advent of technology has also made some jobs obsolete increasing redundancy in employment. Equally some medical professionals work with dilapidated infrastructure that demands innovative ways to work in low resource settings failure to which many patients seek further treatment abroad.

It is estimated that medical tourism costs about $2.1 billion yearly a revenue which has been dented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas various medical professionals on an individual basis have put up structures to ensure training and retraining of their staff as part of promotion requirements but it is not enough. Governments and non-governmental organisations as well as other corporate partners must therefore get involved since the acquisition of technology maintenance and the training of personnel to operate these machines are cost intensive.

Some NGOs working in Nigeria and health partners have stepped in to complement the government’s efforts in providing timely and adequate public health services. For instance the Lift Above Poverty Organisation (LAPO) has undertaken to continuously educate and create awareness on all forms of cancer offering free screening and referral services to all Nigerians especially in towns and villages. Marie Stopes another health NGO is at the forefront of enlightenment and sensitisation on sexual and reproductive health with state-of-the-art health facilities across the country.

Smile Train is another global organisation devoted to free cleft surgery and care. While other NGOs do their best to advance medical services in their area of expertise Smile Train’s unique model of partnerships is most striking.

While Smile Train endeavours to dispel myths and misinformation surrounding cleft the organisation goes the extra mile to train and fund local medical professionals such as surgeons nurses nutritionists anaesthesia providers orthodontists and speech therapists to provide safe quality treatment within the community all year round. Cleft lip and/or palate is a common birth difference whose causes are yet unknown.

Patients with cleft experience difficulty in breathing eating and speaking unable to contribute effectively to the community due to the stigma and isolation they endure. Their “teach a man to fish” model sets them apart from other charitable organisations which deploy missionaries to carry out surgeries isolate the local medical providers from receiving requisite training to carry on their work long after they are gone.

Smile Train has not just offered free cleft surgeries for Nigerians for the past decade; they have also been involved in the training and retraining of healthcare providers to ensure the sustainability of their benevolent efforts.

To curb the challenge of lack of surgical facilities and equipment not just for cleft surgeries but also the general Nigerian population Smile Train in 2019 partnered with global non-profit organisation Safe Surgery Initiative to train medical engineers and lab technicians on repair and maintenance of surgical instruments and equipment. The selected trainees were then encouraged to transfer the knowledge they received to their local hospitals across the states in Nigeria. The result of this training was that the waiting period for surgeries reduced drastically since the need for adequate and functional tools in the theatres was addressed. The trained technicians promptly and regularly service surgical equipment paving way for more surgeries per capita unlike before.

Empirical data on cleft greatly lacking in many low to middle income countries this presents another opportunity for collaboration in the endless pursuit for Universal Health Coverage. Smile Train has gone a step further to partner with the West African College of Surgeons National Surgical Obstetrics Anaesthesia and Nursing Plan (NSOANP) and SearchAnWrite (a research and innovation organisation) to undertake a nationwide training for healthcare providers equipping them with requisite professional knowledge on cleft research and documentation.

Beyond the training the health professionals also benefited from Smile Train grants to undertake research and come out with data that will help prevent and better manage cases of cleft in Nigeria. This first phase of training used purely local manpower and the outstanding trainees have been elevated to becoming trainers and facilitators. Smile Train has also in partnership with the federal ministry of health launched a cleft e-registry system to track and register patients to receive comprehensive cleft care at the nearest partner facility.

Entrenching local content into the health sector is very important if we are to lead the pack in quality healthcare services. This is achieved through investment in the care but also in education and training of the medical professionals.

Increased budgetary allocation to the health sector cannot solve the problem down to its roots except through partnerships and capacity building at the lowest level. Other NGOs like Sightsavers could consider a partnership model to ensure that eye surgeries are not only carried out but the local professionals are strengthened and supported to stand independently to be more sustainable.

The roadside ventas lining the highways of Spain’s largest region have been providing sustenance to the weary traveller for centuries.

Take any main motorway or winding A-road and chances are after a few kilometres you will come across one.

Normally squat ugly rectangles you’ll know them from the line of metal parking shades out front.

Utterly unprepossessing in the main there’s rarely a hint of the quality of food and on most occasions you will leave largely unimpressed.

Yet every once in a while the lowly roadside venta will blow you away.

Take the wonderful 16th century Venta Galwey on the ancient winding road into the Montes de Malaga park or the ancient Venta Alfarnate which once imprisoned Andalucia’s most famous bandit El Tempranillo. They are unforgettable.

Just as breathtaking is the isolated huntsmen’s hideout of Puerto de Galiz in the middle of Los Alcornocales natural park which Rough Guide editor Geoff Garvey highlighted in our last issue. Ditto the simple Venta el Castillejo near Algodonales where I sampled the best fresh tomatoes I have ever eaten.

Of course there are plenty of ‘old chestnuts’ too as I discovered while compiling my book Dining Secrets of Andalucia. I travelled far and wide around the eight provinces of the region to snuffle out the genuine truffles from the mouldy fakes.

Fed up with the Michelin guide’s failure to venture out of the cities and the inability of regional newspapers to point me in the right direction I went out and did it myself.

Now morphed into a website with well over 100 picks quite a few of them are ventas well worth a detour.

Sure you will always find plenty of fried food and the toilets may not have soap (although thanks to Covid they probably do now) but you are guaranteed an ice cold beer for little over a euro and there will always be three or four specials of the day and some interesting local dishes.

My advice? Always always ask what they recommend. And pray it’s not the ‘callos’ (tripe with chickpeas normally) which I have never managed to handle.

While not all strictly ventas most of my favourite 20 roadside restaurants are simple and good value.

Do you agree with my top picks? We are hoping to compile Andalucia’s Top 50 roadside ventas… If there’s a special roadside diner missing from the list you think we should visit we’d love to hear from you. Drop us a comment about why it deserves a place in our guide.

JON CLARKE’S TOP 20 ROADSIDE VENTAS (in no particular order):

Venta Galwey (montes de malaga) a scenic spot with amazing views and tasty stews

Restaurante Los Labraos Benadalid on the scenic A-369 from Gaucin to Ronda. This family- owned spot is charm personified with a lovely terrace

Venta Alfarnate an ancient spot by a river high in the Axarquia which once held famous 18th century bandit El Tempranillo captive.

Venta Victoria on a bend on the famous ‘restaurant road’ up towards Casares from the Costa del Sol this is a historic but stylish place for a good value lunch

Venta Quemada is one of the best stopping off places between Malaga and Alicante. On the main A-92 motorway near Cullar in Granada province this huge establishment does a roaring trade often turning over up to 1000 covers a day.

Venta Pelistre hidden on a back road between Arriate and Ronda has some of the tastiest pork and a wonderful selection of gin and tonics. No wonder famous bullfighter Cayetano is a regular!

Venta La Duquesa in Medina Sidonia is exactly how ventas should look and feel and always buzzing.

Restaurante la Tasquita sits appropriately on Calle la Venta in the tiny village of Benamahoma at the end of the best shady river walk in Andalucia.

Venta Pinto on the approach road to Vejer has a fabulous panoramic terrace for summer dining. The split-level restaurant oozes old world ambience with a roaring log fire in winter months.

Ventorillo el Nene just off the N-340 highway from Tarifa to Vejer near Facinas is a charming stopping off point with all its bullfighting paraphernalia

Caserio de San Benito is one of those secret places that you’d probably pass by without a second glance. But if you find yourself travelling along the main highway between Cordoba to Antequera it’s an absolute must.

Venta Polverilla sits in the Llano de la Cruz valley near Ronda and boasts easily the best shady terrace for miles around.

Venta Marinetto is featured in all the top truck drivers’ restaurant guides the best recommendation for hearty grub at reasonable prices. In front of Granada airport on the A92 there’s also a good choice of tapas.

Ventorillo Patas Cortas on the original road between Malaga and Antequera now the MA-3101 is possibly the oldest venta in the province dating from the 15th century. Charmingly rustic inside the walled garden patio is an idyllic spot for dining.

Venta El Soldao in Los Badalejos (near Benalup on the A-2225) where they do amazing rice dishes including the best Arroz con Faisan in Andalucia claims a foodie pal

Este artículo fue traducido de nuestra edición en inglés.

Las opiniones expresadas por los colaboradores de Entrepreneur son personales

Los descuentos pueden hacer que los clientes crucen la puerta pero esos mismos clientes a menudo le roban las ganancias y luego lo dejan sin su conversión a largo plazo en una base de clientes duradera.

Si bien la tentación de ver un aumento en los ingresos a corto plazo es tentadora y a veces aparentemente necesaria los descuentos crean clientes de bajo valor que no se preocupan por la lealtad a la marca o por encontrar empresas cuyas causas apoyan.

Por qué los descuentos son tentadores pero dañinos

Se sabe que los descuentos impulsan la inflación inmediata de las ventas. Si está en el negocio del comercio electrónico su argumento a favor de los descuentos probablemente se deba a la creencia de que su producto es lo suficientemente bueno como para que los consumidores se enganchen con las muestras los descuentos ayudan a alcanzar las métricas de crecimiento del cliente y sus números anuales deben coincidir con los anteriores. años.

Sin embargo los clientes que ingresan a su marca a través de descuentos ofrecen el valor de por vida más bajo. Los clientes motivados por los descuentos son los menos propensos a volver a comprar y si lo hacen toma mucho tiempo porque también han probado otros productos o servicios con descuento antes de volver a usted. Con el tiempo esto puede degradar el valor de la marca porque sus clientes se han entrenado para pensar que nunca se debe pagar el precio total de un artículo. Por lo tanto si no está ejecutando una venta nuevamente su cliente con descuento se detendrá y a menudo no comprará. Este ciclo lo atrapa para que tenga que ejecutar descuentos el mismo día semana o mes del próximo año para que sus números año tras año se vean bien a perpetuidad.

Los incentivos a la donación funcionan mejor

Los clientes que ingresan a su marca a través de incentivos de donación mediante los cuales su empresa dona un porcentaje de las ventas a organizaciones benéficas son consistentemente los clientes de mayor valor de por vida regresan con frecuencia y vuelven a comprar. Este tipo de actividad aumenta el valor de su marca y permite que la empresa llame de manera genuina y auténtica las causas que apoya mientras que a veces deja las decisiones caritativas en manos de sus clientes con respecto a qué organizaciones benéficas apoyar sobre otras. Un modelo de donación puede ayudar con eventos del mundo real que son relevantes para lo que representa la marca lo que permite no solo un aumento a corto plazo en las ventas sino también una asistencia significativa para quienes lo necesitan. Además el contenido auténtico generado por el usuario que habla sobre cómo la marca apoya a una organización benéfica favorita es un marketing positivo que el dinero a menudo no puede comprar.

Como mínimo reemplazar algunos descuentos con incentivos de donación o combinar descuentos con donaciones a menudo produce resultados sorprendentes. Por ejemplo se puede implementar un principio de ""Obtener Dar"" para parecerse a ""Obtenga un 10 por ciento de descuento y devuelva el 10 por ciento a la caridad"" que tradicionalmente funcionaría mejor que un código de descuento del 20 por ciento y aún así atraería a los buscadores de descuentos. así como aquellos simplemente interesados en mejorar el mundo.

Las aplicaciones pueden ayudar

Hay una pequeña cantidad de aplicaciones de donación que podrían conectarse y funcionar en su negocio conectándose a los sitios web de Shopify sin problemas. Puede consultar la tienda de aplicaciones relacionada con su plataforma de comercio electrónico y elegir la opción que mejor se alinee con sus objetivos.

Utilizando la aplicación de su elección puede seleccionar un puñado de organizaciones benéficas para que sus clientes elijan al finalizar la compra. No tiene que seleccionar organizaciones benéficas para comprometerse a largo plazo. Puede elegir estacionalmente por causas actuales que se alineen con su estrategia de marketing. Por ejemplo es posible que desee donar a una combinación de refugios de animales durante el hacinamiento después de un desastre natural o darle a su cliente la opción de elegir una organización benéfica que empodera a las mujeres durante el Día Internacional de la Mujer.

Al final una filosofía de donaciones sobre descuentos conduce a la ganancia y al propósito por igual.

Sólo las ventas en formato físico eclipsan a las de Dark Souls 3 un 26%.

Elden Ring es el 'Souls' que más rápido se ha vendido y solamente en UK ha superado en ventas físicas a Dark Souls 3 un 26%.

Estas son las cifras y los datos que nos dejan los juegos más vendidos de la semana en Reino Unido. De nuevo gracias a la recopilación e información que tenemos desde GamesIndustry.biz con GfK.

Elden Ring ha sido lo más vendido de la semana y ha roto los moldes creados por otros souls-like anteriores. Cabe recordar que es una completa nueva IP pero ha estado desarrollada por FromSoftware que ya tiene una historia creada.

El estudio tiene su fama por los juegos de acción RPG tan desafiantes que crea para consolas y PC. Prueba de ello son Dark Souls Demon Souls Bloodborne y Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.

Elden Ring ha sido la última y nueva incorporación dentro de su portfolio. El anterior gran souls que más vendió en físico fue Dark Souls 3 en 2016 pero este ha vencido dichas ventas un 26%.

Cabe decir que todo esto llega antes de saber las ventas en digital ya que el mercado de juegos sólo con descarga ha crecido de forma significativa desde 2016; los datos de venta digitales llegarán a fines de semana.

Es el tercer mayor lanzamiento del año en juegos para las tiendas por detrás de Leyendas Pokémon: Arceus y por poco del de la semana pasada Horizon Forbidden West.

El 63% de las ventas totales fueron en PS5 con el 17% restante en Xbox otro 17% en PS4 y un 3% final en PC. Aunque con respecto a esto desde GI.biz nos dejan una nota a modo de aclaración.

PC y Xbox son plataformas con una gran fuerza en lo digital estas cifras son para ventas en formato físico. El estreno de Elden Ring ha significado que Horizon Forbidden West caiga un puesto y sea 2º.

El exclusivo de consolas PlayStation ha visto una bajada en ventas del 79% de una semana a otra. Como curiosidad también ha habido una bajada de stock en cuanto a consolas PS5 disponibles.

Os dejamos con la tabla de juegos más vendidos de la semana en Reino Unido hasta el Top 10 y sin contar el formato digital sólo en físico.

Semana pasada Semana actual Juego Nuevo 1 Elden Ring 1 2 Horizon Forbbiden West 2 3 Leyendas Pokémon: Arceus 4 4 Mario Kart 8 Deluxe 5 5 FIFA 22 7 6 Call of Duty Vanguard 3 7 Dying Light 2: Stay Human 6 8 Animal Crossing: New Horizons 8 9 Minecraft (Switch) 14 10 Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition

Leyendas Pokémon: Arceus es el siguiente de la lista y 3º que baja un puesto. Pero en ventas ha visto un incremento del 5% de una semana a otra.

Otro lanzamiento de febrero como es Dying Light 2: Stay Human ha caído del tercer al séptimo puesto tras un descenso en ventas del 55% desde la semana anterior a esta.

Hay otro nuevo juego que ha entrado en las ventas de juegos en físico de Reino Unido Grid Legends. Ha quedado en puesto 18 y el juego de EA/Codemasters ha vendido mejor en PS5 con un 56% de las ventas totales registradas en la consola de Sony.

A esto le ha seguido un 26% en Xbox y el 17% restante en PS4. La semana que viene tendrá una ligera competencia por el estreno de Gran Turismo 7 en PlayStation 5 y PlayStation 4.

Una cara que ha vuelto al top 10 ha sido la de GTA The Trilogy Definitive Edition con un aumento en ventas del 24% de una semana a otra.

Esto ha sido en buena parte por el aumento en ventas de las versiones en PS4 y Xbox en formato físico. Y esto es todo con respecto a las ventas en juegos de Reino unido en formato físico para la semana acabada el 26 de febrero.

Con más de 35 millones de seguidores en Instagram Gio se ha convertido en todo un fenómeno social con el estreno de su propio documental Soy Georgina. La plataforma Netflix presentaba el pasado 27 de enero seis capítulos donde la pareja de Cristiano Ronaldo cuenta su vida al detalle: una radiografía de su día a día con el objetivo de conocerla detrás de los focos mediáticos. Un documental que muestra las grandes aficiones de Gio. Porque no todo son joyas y ropa la modelo también se declara amante de la comida.

Capaz de ""arrasar"" y gastar 95€ en una tienda de chucherías hasta revolucionar un pueblo de no más de 3.500 habitantes por visitar su carnicería de confianza. ""Se llevó muchas cosas sobre todo secallonas. También hizo compra de otros productos secos que se los separamos para su familia que vive en Italia"".

¿Qué es la secallona que enamora a Georgina Rodríguez?

El no vivir en la zona de Aragón y Cataluña hace que escuchar secallona como embutido suene de todo menos familiar. Además su aspecto puede confundir al cliente y hacerle creer que está ante un fuet o incluso longaniza pero no.

Secallona elaborada en Embutidos Aventín

La secallona es un producto que se elabora con carnes magras normalmente jamón acompañado de grasa preferiblemente de panceta. Todo bien picado y mezclado con un toque de sal y pimienta embutido en tripas de cerdo o cordero y dejándolo secar durante horas.

Un manjar gastronómico que se suele comer crudo cortado en finas lonchas – con su característica forma de ocho a diferencia de la longaniza – acompañado de un buen pan con tomate. El embutido te da la posibilidad de freírlo por la grasa que lo recubre pero no es una elaboración tan habitual. Un snack muy popular en Aragón y Cataluña que se ha convertido en tendencia gracias a la modelo argentina.

Colas a diario para comprar en la carnicería preferida de Gio. La familia Aventín califica esta oportunidad de darse a conocer como un auténtico regalo. La secallona y longaniza de Graus se internacionalizan."

The daring multimillion-pound raid of telecommunications giant Verizon in north London took four weeks to plan - and most of those involved have never been convicted of the robbery.

""We wanted to do something that took it to a different level - the art of robbery I suppose"" Ellis tells Sky News.

""We didn't want to hurt anybody. That's why we didn't take any guns any tools any weapons.

""We didn't want to be like the normal oik armed robbers brandishing guns terrorising people. That's not what we were about.

""Our game was robbery. We weren't in the game of hurting people.""

How was the Verizon robbery carried out?

The Metropolitan Police described Ellis as the ""lynchpin"" of the Verizon raid as he led a gang of robbers posing as police officers into the company's data centre on 6 December 2007.

Arriving in police-style vehicles and dressed in officers' uniforms complete with a dog handler and an Alsatian the group duped security staff by claiming they were investigating reports of an intruder on the roof.

In fact the robbers were there to steal hi-tech computer equipment worth £5m.

""It was deemed by most people in the game as an impossible job"" Ellis says.

""Within about a one-mile vicinity of Verizon you had three police stations... so it was a rat-run for the police.

""Anything could have gone wrong so we had to get the timing right.

""We knocked on the door and showed our IDs.

""It was about being so realistic that we could actually get through all the security procedures in place.""

Image: Verizon was targeted in the raid in December 2007. File pic

Security staff duped into wearing handcuffs

The building's security measures included 24-hour patrols an airlock system on arrival biometric keypad and card entries turnstile entrances CCTV cameras and panic alarms Ellis says.

""For us the worst bit was the entry"" he adds.

""The airlock door was like a human trap. If you don't get through that door you're captured.

""We had to be so convincing.""

Once inside the fake police officers told the building's staff that the ""intruder"" was dressed as a security guard so they had to be handcuffed until the culprit was identified.

The robbers then disconnected the building's CCTV cameras - but that prompted an external security company to call reception to check what was happening.

Image: Ellis says the Verizon robbery was deemed an 'impossible job'

Ellis says: ""I was on reception and just said: 'We've had a surge in the mainframe computer system our tech guys are on it now and it should be up and running in 20 to 25 minutes.'

""They bought that. That gave us an hour.""

Having arrived at about 9pm the gang left the building at around 10pm carrying the stolen equipment in laundry bags.

""By the time the penny dropped we were walking out of there"" Ellis says.

""It was six minutes afterwards the police arrived.""

How Terry Ellis was caught

Ellis says he feared the gang were ""doomed"" due to the attention the high-profile robbery attracted.

""I didn't realise how much s*** would hit the fan"" he adds.

He fled London and ended up living on a canal boat before he was arrested in Luton in September 2008 nine months after the raid.

Image: Ellis 57 is a father of five

Ellis received a 10-year prison sentence for the Verizon robbery along with fellow ""main player"" Denis Carr the Met Police said.

At the time the force said Verizon's security staff went through ""a very traumatic experience"" and the sentences ""should act as a deterrent to anyone else considering a similar type of venture"" - but no one else had been charged over the raid.

Now despite a film about the heist expected to begin production later this year Ellis insists he does not want to ""glamourise"" his criminal past.

""We were just normal guys and our business was crime"" the 57-year-old tells Sky News.

""I do talks in schools and I tell kids they don't want role models like me or the Krays.

""They want role models who go out to work every day.""

After he was detained over the Verizon robbery Ellis says a psychologist suggested he consider going to Grendon Prison in Buckinghamshire which operates as a ""therapeutic community"".

Image: Ellis spent two-and-a-half years at HMP Grendon

Prison therapy alongside killers and paedophiles

Grendon's inmates take part in group therapy in a bid to rehabilitate them they have control over the day-to-day running of their lives and they can be voted out at any time by their peers.

Ellis says: ""At any one time there are only 238 men there. Unfortunately they're the worst criminals in the system - child killers serial killers wife killers paedophiles rapists.

""I met some of the most horrendous people who had killed kids. That taught me tolerance.

""It was hell on Earth. I had people who were rapists and paedophiles questioning me as a f****** criminal questioning my belief system.

""The whole place was a learning place. But I also felt there was a lot of people there who shouldn't be there who were using the system.

""They were churning out more proficient predators because they were more aware of their thoughts and feelings and how to act on them but in a way that they wouldn't get caught.""

Prison system is 'failing spectacularly'

Ellis has since written a book about his two-and-a-half years at Grendon Prison called Living Amongst The Beasts.

He believes the recent escape of sex offender Paul Robson who was missing for five days after fleeing an open prison in Lincolnshire shows that some inmates are ""slipping through the system"".

""This guy jumped through all through the rehabilitation hoops and was deemed a success to leave prison"" he says.

""That's a failure in itself because the minute he landed in open conditions he absconded.

Leaving prison and rejecting his 'vices'

Ellis turned his back on crime after leaving prison in 2017 and has since been involved with the campaign group Camden Against Violence and is currently working with his daughter's custom food delivery business.

The father of five credited his partner Anna his children and his Christian faith with helping turn his life around.

""I used to drink quite a bit I used to take drugs I used to womanise everything else"" he says.

""I used to crave love because I was abandoned as a kid.

""I never dealt with that so all my life I used to crave as much sex as I could from different partners enough alcohol and drugs to sink a f****** battleship.

""I was fortunate enough that I had got rid of all my vices (when leaving prison).

""I got rid of alcohol and everything else in my life that could take me down and replaced it with things that would actually improve my life.

""I go running I go cycling I go on long walks with my girlfriend and my dogs... not chasing that elusive rainbow that was never going to be there.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZjc3Rhci5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9jb21tdW5pdGllcy9tb29ycGFyay8yMDIyLzAyLzI2L21vb3JwYXJrLTUtZy1jb25jZXJucy12ZW50dXJhLWNvdW50eS82ODgwNDUyMDAxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Moorpark residents' 5G concerns has city looking for remedies,"The rollout of 5G small cell towers has Moorpark officials exploring what little they can do to manage the installation in residential neighborhoods given tight federal restrictions.

For several months residents have been voicing opposition to the city about the placement of towers near homes.

The concerns were sparked by the November installation of a small cell tower mere feet from Nicole and Robert Golden's backyard where their children play.

Fifth-generation – or 5G – is the next generation of wireless technology that has been launched by wireless carriers such as AT&T Sprint T-Mobile and Verizon. It is much faster than 4G but requires more wireless installations and a greater density of them.

The Federal Communications Commission strictly limits local control over small wireless facilities whether on private property or in the public right of way.

Even so after listening to residents again express concerns at a special meeting Wednesday night the City Council directed staff to see if there is anything that can be done in keeping with the federal regulatory framework about the deployment of small wireless facilities near homes city spokesman Brian Chong said Friday.

Sustained: T.O. council upholds approval of wireless facility despite health concerns

Currently for instance a city ordinance states three preferences for where it would like to see the facilities go said Chong assistant to City Manager Troy Brown.

They are in order of preference: nonresidential zones; 250 feet or more from a residential zone; or if all else fails residential zones Chong said.

One of the things staff could look into is whether the council wants to add more stated preferences to the ordinance he said. Agoura Hills Chong noted has 10 such preferences.

""So the (Moorpark) council could say 'Well if it's going be in a residential zone we prefer a narrow street rather than a wider street. Or we want it away from parks away from schools'"" he said.

Telecommunications providers can override the preferences if they can demonstrate that a site can only be located there to complete their network Chong said.

""So it likely would not have a significant preventive effect in where they go"" he said. ""It is not going to stop the deployment of cell sites in residential zones.""

Nonetheless ""it's not completely a lost cause"" Chong said.

He noted there was a previous instance in which AT&T wanted to install a wireless facility next to an elementary school.

""And the city said 'Hey doesn't it make more sense to go a couple 100 feet away in (a) shopping center area?'"" Chong said. ""And AT&T said 'Yeah we can still make it work' and did it voluntarily.""

The council also wants to schedule a closed session with City Attorney Kevin Ennis and private attorney Steven Flower a telecommunications law specialist to discuss possible legal options Chong said. Flower gave a presentation at Wednesday night's town hall meeting.

The forum was scheduled after residents led by the Goldens expressed their concerns during public comments at the City Council's Dec. 15 meeting.

Nicole Golden said Friday that AT&T's 4G/5G small cell tower is less than 15 feet from where her children play in the backyard.

She said her chief concern is safety contending the tower isn't installed properly.

""It waves and shakes in the wind"" she said. ""It's right above the kids so if it does fall it could hit them or anybody else actually.""

Plea: Local cities urge California senators to help overturn FCC 5G rollout rule

Also the tower is in the middle of some trees and presents a fire hazard Golden said.

""If it malfunctions the house will go up like a matchbox"" she said.

Golden along with 12 other speakers addressed the council at Wednesday's night's meeting.

""I am the first resident that has a cell located 14 feet from their children's heads and 43 feet from their bedroom window"" Golden said. ""There are other locations the cell (tower) can be relocated away from the front and back yards.

""But AT&T did not do their due diligence to find a non-residential location"" she said.

Other speakers cited health concerns about the small cell towers which emit radiofrequency energy.

Julie Levine who has started a group called 5G Free California said the towers are ""incredibly harmful"" to the health of people at small distances.

The wireless communications industry however says such concerns are unfounded.

""The FCC says it's perfectly safe"" Mayor Janice Parvin said.

Chong noted the 1996 Telecommunications Act says local governments when issuing permits for cell facility sites cannot consider any health or environmental impacts from radio frequency emissions as long as the facilities comply with FCC regulations.

Even so Nicole Golden said she felt heartened by Wednesday night's meeting.

""The fact that they talked about having a discussion about this behind closed doors and they talked about rewriting the ordinance I think is a huge win"" she said.

She said she hopes the city adds more preferred locations like Agoura Hills has.

""That is the ordinance we would like to mimic"" she said.

Parvin thanked the residents who attended the meeting.

""We appreciate your input"" she said. ""It's really valuable to us as we deliberate what next steps we're going to take.""

Chong said AT&T representatives declined an invitation to attend the special meeting.

AT&T Public Affairs Director Ryan Minniear did not respond Friday to a request for comment.

Meanwhile the 30XE is exclusive to T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile.

Both phones launch soon but pricing is a mystery.

Update: February 27 2022 (11 AM ET): TCL has announced the prices for the Verizon-exclusive 30V 5G and T-Mobile-exclusive 30XE 5G. The phones will cost $299 and $199 respectively. Both phones are now available for purchase from their respective carriers. Original article: January 4 2022: TCL is relatively new to making smartphones under its own branding with only two years under its belt. It’s now in the swing of things though and at CES 2022 it launched two new phones for the US market. See also: The best budget phones you can currently buy

The TCL 30V and TCL 30XE are the first phones in the 30 series to hit the US. Both are 5G-capable but you’ll need to be on either Verizon or T-Mobile to get them.

Below you’ll find what you need to know about each device!

TCL 30V: Just for Verizon

TCL

The “V” in the TCL 30V name might stand for Verizon but it might as well. This is a phone exclusive to Big Red in the United States.

Since Verizon’s 5G network is primarily based on mmWave tech it shouldn’t be surprising to hear the 30V supports both Sub-6 and mmWave connections. The relatively weak Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 chipset enables those connections. Required reading: What you should know about mmWave and Sub-6 5G

Under the hood the TCL 30V has 4GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. It has a microSD card slot if you need up to 1TB of extra space. Android 11 powers the phone and it stays alive with a 4500mAh battery. That battery charges at 18W wired but there’s no wireless charging.

On the front you’ll find a 6.67-inch FHD+ (2400 x 1080) display. It has a refresh rate of 60Hz unfortunately and is covered with the quite old Gorilla Glass 3. A centered cutout exposes the selfie camera which is a 16MP shooter capable of capturing video at 1080p/30fps.

On the back you’ll find a triple camera array. The primary shooter is a 50MP wide and it’s flanked with a 5MP ultrawide and a 2MP macro. Next to the camera array you’ll find a trusty capacitive fingerprint scanner.

TCL wouldn’t divulge when you’ll be able to get the 30V nor how much it will cost. All it would cop to is a release date “in the coming weeks” and a price announcement with the same vague promise.

TCL 30XE: For T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile

TCL

If you don’t have Verizon and want a TCL 30 series phone in the US your next best bets will be T-Mobile or Metro by T-Mobile. The two carriers will sell the TCL 30XE.

This is also a 5G device but does not have mmWave support. That will no doubt make it cheaper than the 30V but TCL won’t tell us how much it’s going to cost or when you’ll be able to get it.

On the front the 30XE has a 6.52-inch screen with a low-resolution display (just 1600 x 720). Thankfully that display does have a 90Hz refresh rate which should make it a bit nicer to use. The relatively weak DragonTrail 3 glass covers the screen. See also: The best T-Mobile phones to spend your money on

Inside a MediaTek Dimensity 700 acts as the processor. It’s paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. Once again there’s a microSD card slot if you need extra space but it’s limited to 512GB cards at the max. The 4500mAh battery should last you a long time but TCL wouldn’t divulge how fast it can charge.

On the back the TCL 30XE has a triple-lens camera module. That’s a 13MP wide a 2MP depth sensor and a 2MP macro. In other words this will not be a photography or videography powerhouse. There’s also a capacitive fingerprint scanner back there.

Director N.C. Cooperative Extension - New Hanover County Center and Arboretum

It’s tree giveaway season and February is a great month to plant! The Alliance for Cape Fear Trees the Arbor Day Foundation and Verizon have arranged for 850 trees to be given away on Saturday Feb. 26 9 a.m. at Legion Stadium. About 15 different species are available in small containers with a limit of two per person; arrive early as they’re sure to go fast. Visit https://www.allianceforcapefeartrees.com/.

Also TreeFest is back for the 24th time on Friday Feb. 25 and Saturday Feb. 26 11 a.m.-4 p.m. at Independence Mall inside the JC Penney corridor. Brought to you by several collaborative organizations over 7000 bareroot seedlings will be available with a limit of five per household with a suggested donation of $5.

Experts will be available at both events to assist you with tree selection and you can do your homework here: https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/. Before selecting trees residents are encouraged to consider the size of the site whether utility lines exist above and below ground proximity to buildings and site conditions like soil type drainage and sun exposure.

TreeFest’s curated collection of seedlings includes something for everyone. Want tall and stately? Consider Longleaf Pine or Bald Cypress. For small flowering trees select native Chickasaw Plum Silky Dogwood Eastern Redbud or Sugarberry. Have space for massive majestic and long-lived Overcup Oak Willow Oak or Black Walnut? Perhaps you want a fruit bearing Persimmon or need Red Maple or River Birch to adapt to your moist soils.

Longleaf Pine is an evergreen gymnosperm tree that may grow 60 to 120 feet tall. This pine does best in full sun in well-drained sandy or clay soils.

Bald Cypress a knobby-kneed and long-lived conifer grows to over 100 feet tall. Needled in summer and bald in winter its thick trunks record years of climate data in its rings. It is a familiar sight growing in swampy water with its branches draped with Spanish moss. Nearly foolproof it will also grow very well in drier upland soils.

Black Walnut is an extremely valuable and attractive forest tree. It prefers full sun and rich soils. It produces edible nuts as a mature tree reaching 50 to 90 foot in height with a thick trunk.

Overcup Oak is native to our region and likes low lying areas or along streams rivers or ponds in full sun to partial shade. It can be a large shade tree 45’ – 70’ tall and 45’ wide. As with most native oak trees this is a high-value wildlife plant.

Willow Oak is a local native deciduous tree which may grow 50 to 100 feet tall. It has a desirable rounded form is fast-growing for an oak and is easy to grow in a variety of soils in full sun to light shade.

American persimmon can reach 80 feet high and 35 feet wide but with hot dry urban conditions the tree may grow more like a 15-foot shrub. Persimmons are dioecious meaning you need both a male and female tree to get fruit very sweet when ripe and a food source for many birds and mammals. Persimmon grows best in moist well-drained sandy soils in full sun to partial shade. Great fall leaf color ranges from yellow to orange to bright red.

Chickasaw Plum is a scrubby shrub up to 15 feet tall. In early spring small 5-petaled white flowers mature in clumps producing 1/2-inch yellow to red drupes serving as excellent habitat and food for wildlife.

Silky Ddogwood is a deciduous multi-stemmed shrub that may grow 6 to 12 feet tall. The clusters of creamy white flowers in the spring mature to blue drupes in late summer very attractive to birds. Growing best in shady moist areas it may form a thicket for wildlife habitat.

Eastern Redbud grows to 20 or 30 feet tall and can tolerate full sun or part shade in moderately fertile clay or sandy soil. Regular watering fertilization and pruning out dead branches as needed will keep the tree vigorous. In early spring clusters of pink flowers mature and attract many pollinators.

Sugarberry is a deciduous tree native which can grow 50-70 feet tall or can be kept at shrub size by cutting to the ground every 2-3 years. It is fast growing and is resistant to urban pollution with mature reddish fruits eaten by many birds and mammals. The tree prefers a sandy to clay loam that is moist and well-drained in full sun to partial shade.

Red maple is a native deciduous tree commonly growing to 70 feet high with a 50-foot spread. Average to wet soils and full sun to partial shade is preferred. This is one of the first trees to show color in the fall often a brilliant orange-red.

River birch is a native deciduous upright tree with cinnamon-brown exfoliating bark and yellow fall foliage. It likes moist soils in full sun to part shade growing to 40’ tall or more. Tolerating flooded conditions it is naturally found in riverbanks and floodplains.

Apollo Global Management and Las Vegas Sands Corp. said in separate statements that gamblers conventioneers and hotel guests should see few changes at the luxury hotel complex including the renamed Venetian Expo.

The names will remain the same and George Markantonis CEO of The Venetian Resort said the management team will stay in place.

""We have an exciting opportunity to build on our past successes while capturing future opportunities"" Markantonis said citing hospitality meetings and events gambling and entertainment.

New York-based VICI Properties acquired assets associated with the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the expo for $4 billion. Apollo Global Management bought Venetian operations for $2.25 billion.

Apollo executives told Nevada casino regulators earlier this month the company will step into an ongoing partnership with Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp. to continue with the development of the $1.9 billion 17500-seat MSG Sphere being built just east of The Venetian Expo the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.

Sands the company led by Sheldon Adelson until his death last year will effectively cease U.S. operations to focus on operations in Asia.

Patrick Dumont Sands president and chief operating officer pointed to a recently announced $1 billion reinvestment at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore and a $2.2 billion renovation of The Londoner Macao.

""The foundation of this company was built in Las Vegas and even though the overall size of the organization here will be smaller it is important to each of us that we continue to strongly support our community"" Dumont said.

Adelson bought the Sands hotel once a hangout for Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack in 1989 razed it and built a towering Italian-inspired complex featuring gondolas gliding on a stylized canal through an indoor plaza with stores restaurants and entertainment and outside near Las Vegas Boulevard pedestrians.

Today the Venetian and Palazzo have more than 7000 guest rooms sprawling casino and convention spaces and more than 8000 employees.

Adelson became a billionaire and Republican mega-donor. His family bought Nevada's largest newspaper the Las Vegas Review-Journal. He died in January 2021 at age 87 from complications related to treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. His wife Dr. Miriam Adelson remains the majority shareholder of Las Vegas Sands Corp.

""The opening of The Venetian more than 20 years ago represents the beginning of the company's success"" Las Vegas Sands Chairman and CEO Robert Goldstein said. ""The property and most importantly the people who represent it every day will always remain indelible parts of our history.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

The UK needs to ditch bureaucracy and visa restrictions to provide sanctuary to Ukrainians fleeing their country under attack from Russia senior Tory and Labour MPs have said.

As the Kremlin wages war on their eastern European neighbour Yvette Cooper the shadow home secretary said it was “immoral” to apply usual visa restrictions to Ukranians escaping war.

Priti Patel called her comments “appalling misinformation” and said “the facts” were in government guidance that she shared. The document showed a visa application fee is being waived for family members of Britons who live in Ukraine and Ukrainians in the UK are being given temporary concessions when their visa expires.

According to the latest estimates from the UN refugee agency almost 116000 have fled their homes – predominately to Poland Hungary Moldova Slovakia and Romania – since Vladimir Putin declared war.

Earlier this week The Independent reported that there is currently no safe and legal route for Ukrainians to travel directly from their country to the UK in order to seek asylum unless they have close British relatives.

A No 10 spokesperson said on Friday that troops had been deployed to help the humanitarian response in Poland and were “working incredibly closely with Ukraine’s neighbours” to help support those fleeing.

But they would not be drawn on any further action when asked about safe and legal routes for those wanting to seek asylum in the UK.

Posting on social media on Saturday Conservative MP Julian Smith said ministers must “welcome” those who have been displaced and “make it as easy as possible to be here”.

“It’s really important that the United Kingdom makes an immediate open welcoming & warm hearted commitment of sanctuary to those who wish to leave Ukraine.

“Rip up the usual bureaucracy & let’s just say they are welcome & we will make it as easy as possible to be here.”

Ms Cooper also tweeted on Saturday: “Ukraine is under fire. People are fleeing war. Yet Home Office still applies normal visa restrictions inc salaries language close relatives.”

She said this “isn’t solidarity” with Ukraine but “immoral” and urged the government to “urgently provide simple sanctuary route to UK for Ukrainians who need our help”.

The government told The Independent last week it had waived language requirements for dependents of British nationals.

Speaking during a visit to Birmingham the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Britain should be prepared to take in Ukrainian refugees saying the government has “got this one wrong” in continuing to apply existing visa rules.

“We must help Ukrainian people looking for safety. That is what we have always done as a country in a moment like this” he said.

“The government has got this one wrong. They are applying the same rules as they had before.”

He called for a “humanitarian approach” with “sanctuary for those who are fleeing from Russian aggression fleeing from this invasion fleeing for their lives”.

It comes after a poll by YouGov – following the Russian invasion – found almost two-thirds of British people would support the introduction of a resettlement scheme for those fleeing Ukraine.

Ms Cooper said the war was “already having devastating consequences” adding: “The UK has a duty to work with our allies to provide humanitarian assistance and support to those fleeing this horrific situation.”

“We must also work with the UN Refugee Agency to make sure contingency plans are ready for further support and sanctuary schemes that will be needed and be prepared to play our part in further international action to support refugees.”

Images of Downing Street and other government buildings flying Ukrainian flags posted on social media were also met with calls to ease restrictions on movement.

“Don’t wave flags; waive visas” Sabir Zazai the chief executive of the Scottish Refugee Council said. “Only then will you truly stand with #Ukraine or anyone else fleeing a dreadful conflict.”

In an update posted on Twitter on Saturday the Home Office said the UK government “has an extensive visa application centre network” in countries neighbouring Ukraine.

“Ukrainians in these countries can access these services & apply for visa under existing immigration routes” they said.

The department added: “We have been planning for the impact that a Russian invasion would have on visa application centres and swift action was taken to ensure contingency plans were put in place.

“More staff have been surged to visa application centres. Dependents of [UK] nationals residents in [Ukraine] needing a UK visa can apply through the new temporary Lviv location or through a visa application centre in nearby countries including Poland Moldova Romania & Hungary.”

Labour said the Government’s refusal to relax visa restrictions for those seeking sanctuary in the UK was “immoral” at a time when the country was under fire.

But Home Secretary Priti Patel hit back accusing the opposition of “appalling misinformation” and saying the claims were “simply untrue”.

Speaking during a visit to Birmingham Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged ministers to adopt a “humanitarian approach” to people “fleeing for their lives”.

Ukraine is under fire.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper tweeted: “Ukraine is under fire. People are fleeing war. Yet Home Office still applies normal visa restrictions including salaries language close relatives.

“This isn’t solidarity with Ukraine it’s immoral.”

In response to Labour’s claims Ms Patel tweeted: “Appalling misinformation at a time of international crisis. This is simply untrue.”

A Government spokesman said the priority was supporting British nationals and their dependents who are resident in Ukraine who wanted to get out.

“We are working around the clock to process visa applications and are processing many applications in a matter of hours” the spokesman said.

Appalling misinformation at a time of international crisis. This is simply untrue. Get the facts here: https://t.co/fnEZwluL71 https://t.co/9Gbbw9hU3p — Priti Patel (@pritipatel) February 26 2022

Application fees had been temporarily waived for those eligible for entry by the family route while those who did not meet the requirements were being allowed entry for 12 months.

While the main UK visa application centre in Kyiv has been closed the one in Lviv remained open for family members of British nationals in Ukraine.

Staff had been “surged” to the centres in nearby countries including Poland Moldova Romania and Hungary to help those who made it across the border.

“Ukrainian nationals are able to apply for visas from these centres and we have announced concessions for Ukrainians currently in the UK to extend or switch their visa” the spokeswoman said.",,,,,,,,,

NORFOLK Va. — A Hampton Roads law firm organized a massive gift card giveaway for families to shop at a supermarket in Norfolk's Berkley neighborhood.

Outside the Berkley Supermarket on Saturday morning it was first come first serve and families lined up early.

“Oh my God when we pulled up people had been here since 8:30 a.m. this morning waiting for these gift cards"" attorney Charlene Morring said.

The Law Firm of Charlene A Morring organized the giveaway.

“We started off with $2800 and then Cooper Hurley Injury Lawyers came in with $1000 and today we’re up to $8000 in gift cards that we’re giving away today to this wonderful community supermarket"" Morring said.

Ty Bryant of Cooper Hurley Injury Lawyers said her team just wanted to give back to the community.

Charlene Morring also had another prize up her sleeve.

“We have an extra special raffle going on – one special person is going to get groceries for a full entire year courtesy of the Law Firm of Charlene A Morring"" she said.

Morring decided to organize the giveaway after Norfolk City Councilwoman Danica Royster put out a call to action for the community to support Black owned businesses for Black History Month.

“This community was a food desert and the Palmer family stepped up when no other grocery store would come and support this community"" Royster said. ""So we thought what better way to support those who supported us.”

Until on the brink of halftime it all fell apart for Oaks Christian High girls soccer team.

Duke University commit Mia Minestrella tallied twice as host Redondo Union scored three times in a five-minute span at the end of the first half to turn away visiting Oaks Christian 3-0 in the CIF-Southern Section Division 2 final Saturday afternoon.

“It’s unfortunate” Oaks Christian head coach Sebastian Alvarado said. “It’s an 80-minute game and for five minutes we let our guard down.”

The young Lions controlled the opening 30 minutes. Senior Erin Zeile hit the crossbar in the 19th minute. Junior Berkley Mape’s header from Sarah Spears’ corner in the 30th minute was just palmed over the crossbar.

“We started well” Alvarado said. “Our game plan was to keep it tight for the first 20 minutes and get the crowd out of the game. Obviously playing in their home field they had a packed house. The girls came out and did what we asked them to do it.”

But the program’s 10th sectional final unraveled after it didn’t get a referee’s decision in the 36th minute.

Minestrella headed in a goal to give Redondo the lead after a turnover that looked to be caused by a Redondo hand ball.

“We screamed ‘handball’ ” Alvarado said. “We told ‘handball’ to the linesman. … If that handball gets called they don’t score and hopefully we get to halftime even. Sometimes you get the breaks sometimes you don’t.”

Two minutes later Minestrella made it 2-0 on a full-field Redondo counterattack from an Oaks Christian corner.

The Lions defense dealt with the initial chance but Redondo pounced on a clearance.

Freshman Shannon Davidson put the match away just before halftime with a fantastic finish inside the left post.

“I think it was a shock too” Alvarado said. “The ball’s been in their half and all of a sudden we’re two goals down in two minutes.”

The second half came and went without a breakthrough despite Oaks Christian pressure.

“The girls kept their composure and fought hard in the second half” Alvarado said. “We just couldn’t break them.”

Despite the loss Oaks Christian (18-2-4) will move into the CIF State regional playoffs this week.

“Overall it was a great experience for a lot of the younger girls” Alvarado said. “At the end of the day we lost to a good team.

“Of any team we played this year their team speed showed. From the forwards to the defense and even the goalie … all positions on the field they were quick.”

Unfortunate history for Thacher

The Thacher School girls soccer team was on the unfortunate end of a historic CIF-Southern Section final Saturday afternoon in Ventura.

Freshman Kayalily Penn scored six goals as Bishop Diego came from 5-2 down in the second half to edge Thacher 6-5 in overtime in the Division 7 final at St. Bonaventure High.

The highest-scoring soccer final in CIF-SS history boys or girls was decided by the player to score the most goals in a CIF-SS final.

“What I saw from Kayalily Penn at Bishop Diego was the most incredible individual effort I’ve seen in high school athletics” Thacher head coach A.J. Yates said.

Penn who plays for the Camarillo Eagles club team has scored 52 goals this season including an incredible 29 in the playoffs. Her cousin is former Stanford star Kiki Pickett who plays for the Kansas City Current of the National Women’s Soccer League.

“We knew where they were going” Yates said. “She’s phenomenal.”

Junior Hattie Hatton scored three goals junior Jordan Yates had two goals and assist and freshman Catherine Feira had two assists as Thacher ended its season with the most goals scored in a losing effort in a CIF-SS final.

“It was a pretty unbelievable game” Yates said.

The two Frontier League foes had already faced each other twice in league play.

The Toads led Bishop Diego 5-2 on Jan. 20 when it went on to win 8-2.

“This game that wasn’t the case” Yates said.

Bishop Diego handed Thacher its only previous loss — 4-3 in overtime — on Feb. 3 in Santa Barbara.

“We knew what they were capable of” Yates said.

Thacher responded to Bishop Diego’s early 2-0 lead by surging ahead 3-2 before halftime.

“We made a decision” Yates said. “We’ve been successful attacking putting teams on their heels so we changed formations.”

Yates dribbled through the defense and slotted home in the 33rd minute. Moments later Hatton took the ball off an opponent and scored from 35 yards to tie the game.

Yates dribbled through traffic and finished from the penalty spot to put the Toads ahead 3-2 in the 38th minute.

Hatton scored twice after halftime to put Thacher up 5-2 finishing from a tight angle after a Yates throw in and placing a 37-yard free kick in a corner just under the Bishop Diego crossbar.

But unlike on Feb. 3 Bishop Diego did not wither. Penn scored from 45 yards to make it 5-4 in the 68th and tied the game from the penalty spot with three minutes left.

“We probably have a better chance of saving a PK than letting Penn attack in open play” Yates said.

Pen then headed in Siena Urzua’s corner kick for the title-winning tally in the second half of overtime.

Thacher’s incredible season ends at 14-2-1. Yates and Hatton combined for 72 goals and 47 assists on the season.

“Unfortunately we’re opting out of the regionals” Yates said. “Our kids start exams on Tuesday.”

Members of the team leave this week to sing in Europe. Hatton and two teammates actually had musical performances on Friday and Saturday night. Another player was involved in a 13-hour national math competition during the game.

“The same way we demand excellence in so many other areas of this school we’ve got a group of girls who are demanding excellence on the soccer field from themselves and their teammates” Yates said. “It’s created a really positive culture I hope will continue.”

Grace Brethren boys edged in Div. 7

For a brief moment the Grace Brethren High boys soccer team had its title-winning moment.

But Joseph Nandor’s potential winning goal from Jeremy Larson’s cross was disallowed in the final minute.

From there top-seeded Los Angeles-Geffen Academy edged the visiting Lancers 4-2 on penalty kicks after a 1-1 tie in the CIF-Southern Section Division 7 final Saturday night at UCLA’s Wallis Annenberg Stadium.

“A very controversial call” Grace Brethren head coach Matt Larson said. “No (video review) in high school unfortunately.”

The decision happened so fast it wasn’t even clear why the goal was disallowed.

Larson thought it was for offsides but video of the incident appears to show that wasn’t the case. The ball may have just gone out of bounds before Larson’s cross.

“It looked like we had it” Larson said. “We definitely started to celebrate but (the flag) went up pretty quickly.”

Grace Brethren players immediately began to appeal to the referee but play was waved on quickly to end the debate.

“Ref blew whistle for the boys to keep playing” Larson said. “That’s how you get boys out of an argument.”

Grace Brethren’s first boys soccer sectional final was a tight affair.

Geffen Academy took the lead in the first half on a “great goal” Larson said.

“They broke down our defense and were able to get out wide” Larson said. “The guy essentially had a one on one with the keeper.”

Facing a defense which had not conceded a goal in the postseason the Lancers found an equalizer with 12 minutes to play.

Jeremy Larson was fouled in the penalty area and senior Kai Terentieff converted the spotkick to make it 1-1.

Geffen Academy hadn’t allowed a goal since Feb. 1.

Momentum shifted after the equalizer as the Lancers searched for a winner.

“We definitely piled on the pressure from there” Larson said.

Nandor a defensive midfielder who had spent much of the playoffs in goal started the game between the posts. He moved into midfield on the hour mark and for a brief moment thought he had scored the winner.

Trevor Thelen spent the final 50 minutes of the match in goal keeping Geffen Academy from scoring a second before Nandor returned to the goal mouth for PKs.

During the shootout Larson and freshman Tyler Larson converted penalty kicks and Nandor saved Geffen Academy’s second attempt but it wasn’t enough.

“Joe got his finger (on the decisive PK)” Matt Larson said. “He dove farther than I’ve ever seen him dive. “

Despite the controversial moment Geffen Academy (13-1-2) is a worthy champion Larson said.

“They were a great team” Larson said. “That’s definitely the best team we’ve played this season.”

Grace Brethren (10-3-3) is looking forward to CIF State regionals this week.

“It’ll be fun” Larson said.

Viral Massachusetts TikTok star ‘took every opportunity tha,"Like many people Delaney Wilson found herself with a lot more alone time during the COVID-19 pandemic. But then she found her thoughts turning on herself.

“I had a lot of time locked in my room. And that left a lot of room for thinking. Thinking about insecurities things that were going on in my personal life that I felt like I couldn’t control” she told MassLive. “And a lot of it turned on me. I turned on myself. And I found myself in a depression of negative thoughts.”

Some days she said she would judge her body some days it was her voice. Other times she was simply worried what others thought of her.

“I was posting [to social media] but it was not often and I would get really in my head” she said.

Then one day the Berkley Mass. native was singing while she nannied. The woman who had hired her Nicki Maher filmed it. And with Wilson’s permission she posted it to TikTok.

“About an hour later it had a million views. And then eventually it got all the way up to I think 16 million and other platforms started getting millions of views with the video” she said laughing.

Soon comments started flooding TikTok saying “Get this girl on American Idol.”

It didn’t take “American Idol” long to call.

“At first I did not believe that it was real. It’s been one of my dreams since I was a little girl. But when I joined the Zoom call and realized it was real I was freaking out” she said. “It felt like a fever dream.”

The 20th season of “American Idol” begins Sunday. Fans will have to tune into watch Wilson’s journey but she said she’s already learned so much.

For starters she’s been posting a lot more on social media where she goes by Delaney Renee.

Recently she’s been posting a “cover countdown” to Sunday’s “American Idol” premiere. As of Friday Wilson had nearly 300000 follows on TikTok and her fans already have a name. They’re called the “laneybugs.”

Fans request her to cover songs including from Billie Eilish and Beauty and the Beast.

Still those insecurities creep back up sometimes.

“That’s when I have to go back and remind myself that these people are following along on my journey for a reason. These people stuck around because they see something in me” she said. “So why should I be holding myself back when that’s what I want to do? I want to show them who I am. I want to give them what I make in my music. So why am I holding myself back with these things in my head?”

With the hopes of heading the Hollywood Wilson said she’s not forgetting her Massachusetts roots.

“I took every opportunity that was around me” she said. “I would do local talent shows at this place called Camp Welch. I would do open mic nights at wherever I could find them and I would go to surrounding towns to take part in shows and musicals wherever I could let my voice be heard.”

She also attended Berklee College of Music studying music business and performance.

“I want to be a business woman and spread my music and create fun things that I know my people will like and other people will like” she said. “Just create like create create create.”

And it’s not just with music. Wilson is an artist in other ways too.

“I did a local open-air market in Massachusetts where I would take old records that were scratched or damaged and I would paint artwork on them” she said. “And people loved it.”

Wilson said Maher understands her babysitting days are likely over but she’s been very supportive.

“I love babysitting and I love what that video did and what came about from it” Wilson said. “But I have lots more to give and my voice has so much that it can do that I’ve yet to share with the world.”

It’s clear that the store less than a decade old is busy if not thriving.

That’s not the case according to attorneys representing Walmart who have filed appeals arguing that the Thomaston location and a number of other stores around Maine and the country should for the purposes of property tax assessment be compared to a shuttered warehouse rather than an open store.

“They say we should be valuing their store equivalent to a store that’s been closed and sold with restrictions on it” said Dave Martucci the Thomaston assessor who called the situation “absurd.”

Known as the “dark store” theory the argument being made by retailers is that their open bustling stores are equivalent to ones that failed and closed. Companies argue that the stores are so specially designed that they are functionally obsolete nearly as soon as they are built and will lose much of their value as soon as the retailer leaves. Corporate attorneys are deploying the strategy in an effort to slash property taxes often by hundreds of thousands of dollars in communities around the country.

Despite an outcry over the problem several years ago and a vow by Maine lawmakers to help towns fight the appeals the onslaught of requests has continued around the state. They are overwhelming assessors and creating a years-long backlog at a state board that hears the cases as well as costing taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost tax revenue and legal fees.

Since 2015 according to data collected by The Maine Monitor large retailers have succeeded in lowering the valuation of their properties by more than $16 million in communities from Biddeford to Bangor resulting in hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax reductions. Hundreds of millions of dollars in abatement requests are still outstanding around the state.

Take Thomaston. Looking to expand beyond its successful Rockland location just a few miles away Walmart opened a Supercenter there in 2013 complete with a pharmacy grocery store garden center hair salon and vision center. The 150000-square-foot building cost roughly $28 million to construct.

Thomaston officials gave a warm reception to the company which promised to employ 300 people. “Welcome Wal-Mart” shouted then-Thomaston Town Manager Valmore Blastow to a crowd that gathered on opening day according to the Bangor Daily News. “We have been pursuing this day for 13 years.” The town even spent $3 million on a sewer extension to reach that section of Route 1 in an effort to entice Walmart and other large retailers to locate there.

Then five years after the store opened attorneys representing Walmart filed an appeal with the town’s assessing department. They argued that the Supercenter was worth $8.9 million $7 million less than the $15.89 million that Martucci the assessor had come up with. The proposed valuation would cut the company’s annual tax bill nearly in half by $172354 meaning less money for schools government roadwork and police and fire departments and more profit for Walmart.

The company has filed nearly identical appeals every year since.

“This is all a strategy to wear down the town” said Martucci.

Retailers assessors disagree on approach

Assessors determine property value in a number of ways. They take into account the cost to replace the facility subtracting value for depreciation and adding improvements that have been made. For retail properties they might also look at the revenue the property generates or at sales of comparable properties on the market. All of those factors are considered and reconciled to arrive at a final figure.

Companies however say depreciation is a much bigger factor than assessors take into account and the revenue a business generates is not meaningful in valuing a property. They also argue that it’s hard to get someone to rent or buy a defunct big box store and when stores do sell it’s for much less than the original owners paid to get the place up and running.

That’s often true. The former Walmart site in Rockland which closed when the Thomaston store opened down the street was valued at $10.1 million when it was open but sold to Ocean State Job Lot for just $3.13 million in 2013. A shuttered Walmart in Ellsworth sold for $3.6 million in 2009 $1.6 million less than the company paid a decade earlier not including improvements. The building now houses a Marden’s and a Tractor Supply.

But assessors say comparing sales of former big box stores to thriving open stores doesn’t make much sense for the purposes of property valuation. Location is everything in real estate and those stores may have closed because their location was less desirable. Assessing rules require property to be valued as it exists on the date of valuation not what it might look like at some future date. And the market for second-generation big box stores is different meaning they may have a different “highest and best use” than when they were built.

Lowe’s has filed 13 abatement requests in eight communities since 2015 records reviewed by The Maine Monitor found. Photo by Kate Cough.

Also stores may close because they don’t meet certain benchmarks or a company wants to expand which Martucci pointed out is “purely a business decision and does not necessarily reflect any market condition that affects value.” Plus most former big box stores are encumbered by deed restrictions that prevent other companies from operating anything similar in that space a common tactic for large retailers when they vacate a property.

Deed restrictions put in place by Walmart on the former Rockland store for instance prohibit anyone from using the facility as a grocery store a discount department store a wholesale club a pharmacy or a recreational facility among others.

That makes it almost impossible to tell what the property would have sold for without limitations.

“It’s understandable that they don’t want competition” said Rep. Ann Matlack D-St. George who has sponsored legislation that aims to help assessors fight the requests. But because of the deed restrictions Walmart placed on the property “what the city of Rockland eventually got was a building that was of a lesser value” said Matlack.

“Then the Super Walmart of Thomaston said ‘This is what our building will look like in the future. We think this is comparable and we want our assessment lowered because we may be wonderful right now but eventually we’re going to look like that.’ ”

‘Either way the taxpayer is going to lose’

At first New Jersey-based tax firm Stavitsky & Associates representing Walmart offered little reasoning on why it felt the Thomaston store was overvalued. When the town said it would deny the request without more information Stavitsky provided an analysis that compared the Thomaston Walmart to six stores that recently sold or were for sale only one in Maine.

Asked about the Thomaston case Bruce Stavitsky said he was not authorized to speak on behalf of Walmart. Walmart and Lowe’s did not return requests for comment.

Most stores used for comparison were decades old. None had a supermarket as the Thomaston building does. Some properties being offered as comparisons for assessing purposes were vacant with deed restrictions intentionally limiting how the properties could be used.

The Stavisky filing also claimed according to the Thomaston Board of Assessors that “the real estate has expenses but no income attributable to it” an assertion the board called “astonishing.” The local board denied the appeal.

Walmart’s attorneys pressed on. The company took the matter to the State Board of Property Tax Review which nearly four years later has yet to hear the case. Every year since Walmart has filed nearly identical abatement requests costing the town tens of thousands of dollars in staff time and legal fees. All are pending review by the state board.

If the town loses said Martucci “We’ve got almost $900000 in tax rebates we’d have to make plus another $71000 in interest. That’s real money.” That doesn’t include the loss in taxes going forward.

Martucci estimated that Thomaston taxpayers have spent $30000 in legal fees alone in the past few years to deal with the requests. Other assessors said it was difficult to estimate their costs but that they were often “significant.”

“If we stick to our guns” said Martucci “we incur tremendous amounts of cost. If we don’t then we lose a tremendous amount of tax value. Then everybody else in town has to pick up that slack. That tax money has to come from somewhere.”

The tactic of regularly appealing abatements is common and growing. Since 2015 retailers including Shaw’s Walmart Home Depot Lowe’s Walgreens Sam’s Club and BJ’s have filed at least 66 abatement requests in 17 communities around the state according to records compiled by The Maine Monitor.

In some cases they’ve prevailed at least in part. For 2018 and 2019 Bangor agreed to a two-year settlement value of $17000000 for the Walmart store. This resulted in a $2.19 million reduction in 2018 but only a $1.33 million reduction in 2019 as the total assessed value had come down slightly between 2018 and 2019. Scarborough faced with requests from Walmart Lowe’s and Sam’s Club agreed to a $2.7 million reduction in Walmart’s value in 2018 and a $1.76 million reduction for Lowe’s in 2021.

Martucci understands why towns want to settle but he worries that doing so may not actually be legal. It may also set a precedent that would make it easier for others to make a similar case shifting more and more property tax burden onto residents.

“If we arbitrarily reduce the value to settle with them we’re not basing that on any of the facts we’re supposed to use” said Martucci. “If we don’t settle with them the taxpayer is funding the bill for the legal process. Either way the taxpayer is going to lose.”

State board that hears cases is ‘non-existent’

Complicating matters in Maine is that the State Board of Property Tax Review which hears requests that have been denied at the local level has not heard a case in at least two years according to several assessors.

Tens of millions of dollars in abatement requests and more than 30 cases dating to 2018 are still pending review and have not been scheduled for a hearing according to documents obtained by The Maine Monitor.

The board which has 15 members serving three-year terms was created in 1986 to hear appeals from denials of tax abatements by assessors or local boards of assessment review. The state board deals only with non-residential property with a valuation of at least $1 million as well as cases related to tree growth farmland open space mine site and working waterfront classified property.

Assessors around the state are frustrated with the backlog.

“The state board has been dysfunctional for many years” said Martucci. Several assessors said they thought staffing issues underfunding board vacancies and the pandemic contributed to the problem.

Thomaston is still waiting to have the 2018 Walmart case heard by the state board. While it waits Walmart continues to file abatement requests — one each year since 2018 all pending review.

Had the board heard the 2018 case in a timely fashion it likely would have prevented those subsequent appeals said Martucci by providing a clear answer for assessors not just in Thomaston but around Maine. That could have saved taxpayers a lot of time and money in staff time and legal fees.

Rep. Matlack said that cases before the board which was conceived to deal primarily with land use issues had become increasingly technical and complex.

“It’s morphed over time to deal with other tax implications so it’s more difficult for them although they’re very smart people. They don’t really have the staff. They don’t have anybody that can really help them.”

Rep. Ann Matlack D-St. George has sponsored legislation that aims to help assessors fight the abatement requests from corporations. Photo by Kate Cough.

There is funding in the 2022-23 state budget for two positions a supervisor to oversee the board’s process and clerical staffing said Matlack. That will hopefully help alleviate some pressure.

When asked about the backlog vacancies and the Thomaston case spokesperson for the Department of Administrative and Financial Services Kelsey Goldsmith told The Maine Monitor in an email the board “will not be able to comment about this ongoing legal matter.”

Legislation aims to help assessors

Assessors hope legislation carried over from last session will provide some relief to communities. LD 1129 which recently passed out of committee would require assessors to “consider age condition use type of construction location design physical features and economic characteristics” when valuing a property. It would apply to all property assessments not just retail facilities and would also bar companies from making the argument that restricted properties (such as the former Rockland Walmart) are comparable for assessing purposes to those that aren’t under such limitations.

The bill would allow assessors to “have another weapon in our arsenal to say you can’t take a thriving store or retail store that’s doing well that was built to do what it’s doing and is still operating and then tell me that the value of that should be the same as a store that failed or a store that’s old and no longer functional” said the Camden and Rockport assessor Kerry Leichtman during a work session on the legislation earlier this month.

That would be nothing new. It would codify what assessors already do said Leichtman “but put it into statute rather than common practice.”

The legislation wouldn’t prevent anyone from appealing the assessment of their property but would save municipalities a lot of money in court proceedings and staff time said Leichtman by giving assessors something to point to if a company makes an argument that it’s open business is equivalent to a vacant store.

Towns shouldn’t expect the legislation to prevent all big box abatement requests however said Peter Lacy an attorney with Maine Revenue Services during a committee hearing.

“Municipalities not being able to have the time or the wherewithal to go head to head against a Fortune 500 company is not necessarily something that you could solve statutorily” said Lacy.

Adding statutory language may even be a setback because it means new language that hasn’t been interpreted by the courts Lacy added.

“It’s not clear that there is a silver bullet for this issue.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vY29tcGFyaXNvbi1hbGRpLXZzLXdhbG1hcnQtcHJpY2VzLW1lYXQtcHJvZHVjZS1wYW50cnktcmV2aWV3LXBob3Rvcy0yMDIyLTLSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2NvbXBhcmlzb24tYWxkaS12cy13YWxtYXJ0LXByaWNlcy1tZWF0LXByb2R1Y2UtcGFudHJ5LXJldmlldy1waG90b3MtMjAyMi0yP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Comparison: Aldi vs Walmart prices on meat produce pantry staples,"I typically do most of the shopping for my two-person household at Walmart with occasional Costco trips but seeing the prices stacked up has me determined to make Aldi my main shopping destination at least for meat and pantry staples.

The Vernon Hills Police Department responded around 12:08 p.m. Thursday to Walmart 555 East Townline Road in Vernon Hills.

Dispatchers received a 911 call of a shot that was fired at a vehicle according to police officials.

Responding officers learned the driver of a light-colored Dodge Journey fired a single shot at another vehicle following a traffic altercation.

The incident occurred in the parking lot and the Dodge left the area prior to police arrival.

The driver was described as male Hispanic in his 20s. No additional description was provided.

Police determined that no one was injured. No arrests have been made and the incident remains under investigation.

Police released two stock images of a light-colored Dodge Journey — similar to the suspect’s vehicle.

“This appears to be an isolated incident without further threat to the community” the police department said in a statement.

Anyone who has information regarding the incident is asked to contact the Vernon Hills Police Department Investigations Unit at 847-247-4883.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpbGxhZ2VzLW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMjIvMDIvMjYvd2FsbWFydC1hdC1zYXJhc290YS1wbGF6YS1pbi10aGUtdmlsbGFnZXMtd2lsbC11bmRlcmdvLXJlbW9kZWxpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart at Sarasota Plaza in The Villages will undergo remodeling,"The Walmart Neighborhood Market at Sarasota Plaza in The Villages will undergo remodeling this summer.

Bidding for contractors for a “special project rebrand ” will begin in March. Work is expected to begin in June and be completed by August. The architect for the project is the Cuhaci Peterson architecture firm of Maitland.

The store opened in October 2017. It is a full-service grocery store with a large produce and health and beauty section. It also sells gasoline. It was the second Walmart store to be located within the “yellow lines” of The Villages. The first Walmart in The Villages was built at Buffalo Ridge Plaza."

So yes it made a lot of sense that for a one-off pre-release show at Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles on Friday the singer-songwriter known offstage as Josh Tillman would have the Los Angeles Philharmonic to join him on their home stage.

There’s a risk of course in these mashups of rock bands and orchestras regularly seen at Disney Hall and even more at the Hollywood Bowl. If the band is too loud if the arrangements too soft it can all feel a bit pointless watching the violins play hearing only guitars and drums.

This though was one of the great ones with Father John Misty the eight guys in his band and the orchestra blending beautifully over 20 songs scattered over an hour and 40 minutes.

The opening numbers “I Love You Honeybear” and “Hangout at the Gallows” only hinted at how well this collaboration would work. The strings were lush the brass added depth.

With “Mr. Tillman” though the night started to shine as the percussive pizzicato playing of the strings backed Tillman on his whistling outro to the tune.

“Chateau Lobby #4 (in C for Two Virgins)” slipped into a Latin groove with maracas and the orchestra’s brass section behind Father John Misty’s trumpet soloist. “When You’re Smiling and Astride Me” featured Tillman’s big soulful vocals over the string section.

This performance with the LA Phil had originally been scheduled for two nights at the Ford amphitheater in September before COVID concerns canceled that plan.

That might have been a blessing though for both the sterling acoustics of Disney Hall and the fact that the new songs debuted on Friday had a chance to find familiarity with fans.

“Q4” the second single released off the forthcoming “Chloë and the Next 20th Century” arrived midway through the show. Its synthesized harpsichord melody and orchestration nailed a certain kind of ’60s baroque pop style.

“Hollywood Forever Cemetery Sings” the 2012 single that brought Father John Misty to the attention of many followed with Tillman playing electric guitar for the only time all night and most of his band sitting out in favor of the orchestral backing.

Highlights in the second half of the set included “Ballad of the Dying Man” which showed off the falsetto Tillman uses to great effect.

“Funny Girl” a single released in January stepped even further back in musical time than “Q4.” Its arrangement sounded like part of the soundtrack to a ’50s romance with the orchestra at its lushest from the strings that swelled at the start to the glissando run by the harpist at the finish.

It was followed by another of Tillman’s best compositions “Pure Comedy” a song that explains the occasional comparisons of Tillman to Randy Newman. (Harry Nilsson is another common touchstone and it’s true their wry dark humor set against sweet melodies is similar.)

The main set ended with “God’s Favorite Customer” and a song that begins with the word “Holy” and ends with one we can’t print after which the band left the stage for a moment the orchestra for good.

With just Tillman and his band for the encore the concert wrapped up like a rock and roll show with fans on their feet for the first time all night for “Total Entertainment.”

Tillman who didn’t talk as much on stage as he often does – a shame for he can be a very funny frontman – did his usual shimmy strut a few times while the orchestra was behind him.

But “Date Night” which closed out the show saw him unleashed. As the band played a bluesy sax-fueled rocker not all that far removed from a Rolling Stones groove Tillman pranced and strutted like Mick Jagger waving to the cheering fans on all sides of the stage until the moment he vanished offstage.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1lcGFya2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2ZsdW1lLzIwMjIwMi84ODA1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Introducing the Characters on Disney's Galactic Starcruiser,"Introducing the Characters on Disney's Galactic Starcruiser

The most unique aspect of the Galactic Starcruiser experience is that guests can get immersed fully in the Star Wars universe and are given the latitude to cosplay in an intimate environment alongside seasoned actors and performers.

This article will describe the characters guests will meet while on the Halcyon and will reveal critical points of the overarching plot aboard the Star Wars Galactic Starcruiser so be warned... SPOILER ALERT!

The setting of the Galactic Starcruiser experience corresponds to what guests find on Batuu in nearby Star Wars Galaxy’s Edge which is chronologically between the events of Episode 8 (The Last Jedi) and Episode 9 (The Rise of Skywalker). Walt Disney World’s Star Wars land already highlights many lesser-known characters within the Star Wars Universe like Hondo Onaka Lieutenant Beck and Vi Moradi while also using more familiar characters from the movies like Chewbacca Rey Finn Kylo Ren General Hux Lieutenant Beck Nien Nunb Poe Dameron and Yoda. Some of those familiar characters from Galaxy’s Edge make their way aboard the Halcyon including Rey Chewie Kylo Ren and Yoda while Hondo and Poe may be seen on screens if their more peripheral roles in the events on the Halcyon intersect with your stories.

However there are a whole host of new characters aboard the Halcyon that will be completely new to even the most hardcore fans who are constantly interacting with guests and leading you through the stories that are playing out in real time. Some of these characters have very straight-forward back stories and traits while others are more complicated and layered. Each character is played by a seasoned performer using scripted and improvised dialogue while interacting with guests or acting out scenes and vignettes. Performers are also equipped with microphones that connect to integrated speaker systems throughout the ship to allow guests to hear the characters in larger or more crowded spaces.

Characters are also wearing earpieces which I would assume provide a way for stage directors to provide dialogue and blocking cues along with passenger information to make interactions more personal. While there are probably only 250-400 guests on the ship at any given time that’s still a lot of names to remember and the live character interactions also need to be synchronized with the activities and tasks guests have completed within the Datapad to provide the most immersive and seamless experience. Also for those who remember Adventurer’s Club at Downtown Disney guests are likely to end up with some characters more than others depending upon the decisions they make during their adventure but in the end the choice is yours as to how you want to engage with the characters and stories playing out on the Galactic Starcruiser.

Captain Riyola Keevan is a Pantoran and is responsible for the safety and well-being of everyone on the Halcyon. She is a strong character who knows what tone to strike at any given time. We did not have many personal interactions with the Captain – it appeared that her interactions were more personal within the groups that included younger children. She is the mother figure of the voyage and will take swift and decisive action when her crew or passengers are threatened. A lot of early criticism of the Galactic Starcruiser experience has focused on the look and styling of this character. In person and up close the character makeup and costuming are very impressive and far beyond a dark blue faced human seen in early promotional videos.

Cruise Director Lenka Mok is in charge of on-board entertainment. She is essentially the ship’s first officer and follows Captain Keevan’s lead. Lenka is actively working to coordinate guests to complete tasks on Batuu in support of the Resistance in addition to making sure everyone is having a good time. While Keevan acts compliant when the First Order boards the ship Lenka is obviously unhappy with the intrusion and works covertly to undermine the First Order occupation. We did not have a lot of personal interactions with Lenka but we did perform a number of tasks for her through the Datapad on the ship and also on Batuu.

SK-620 is an R2-style droid who rolls around the ship acting as the assistant cruise director. As with many Star Wars stories droids play a critical role in the action. When the First Order boards the Halcyon SK is placed in restraining bolts while they attempt to extract potential secret resistance plans and data. It was very impressive to see SK roam the main floor of the atrium alongside guests without bumping into anything or anyone. It was unclear whether the droid was being controlled remotely or truly autonomous but even if SK was under human control the interactions with between passengers crew and the droid were very convincing and on point.

Sammie is the ship’s mechanic who was just recently hired for the position aboard the Halcyon. Sammie is a very layered and complex character whose arc takes many twists and turns. Many of the primary plot points during the experience pivot around Sammie’s decisions and loyalties. Sammie’s character is probably the most approachable to the widest audience and we found ourselves involved in many interactions with this character. He is often hesitant and unsure which adds mystery to his character and interactions. There is even an easter egg regarding Sammie in Oga’s Cantina- a sign written in Aurebesh advertises for a mechanic for the Halcyon who must speak Shyriiwook the Wookie language.

Gaya is a Twi’lek and the featured entertainer for the first evening’s dinner performance. The actor portraying Gaya on our voyage was an incredibly talented singer. Most of the original songs Gaya performs were explicitly created for the Galactic Starcruiser and contain many hidden messages that reveal her motivations and background but her song Oola Shuka has been on the soundtrack in Oga’s Cantina since the opening of Galaxy’s Edge. Gaya is a classic diva who craves the spotlight and will always make sure she is the center of attention and these traits constantly play out as she roams the ship.

Raithe Kole is Gaya’s manager and is a bit of a scoundrel to make sure he keeps his client happy. Raithe is a character we interacted with frequently during our adventure especially Zach who was drawn to Raithe’s love of playing Sabacc. The character of Raithe also intersects many other storylines onboard the Galactic Starcruiser that can be used to jump between different plots and characters. Raithe is a convincing analog to Han Solo in this story as he typically has good intentions with his actions but will rarely allow his own personal desires and motivations to be ignored when making decisions.

Ouannii (pronounced wan-ee) is a Rodian the same species as Greedo. She is a musician and is Gaya’s accompanist. Ouannii speaks Huttese which is difficult at first to understand when interacting with her. However it doesn’t take long for guests to start figuring out what she is saying in the context of conversations and body language. Her character design is by far the most “alien” of all the character aboard the Halcyon and the special effects used to change her facial expressions and speech are amazing even when you are up close and personal with her. A first glance at Ouannii and you will be instantly convinced you are in the world of Star Wars. I particularly thought the ability of this character design to hold up after closer inspection was one of the most amazing aspects of the Galactic Starcruiser. Ouannii’s storyline is more peripheral to the major storylines playing out aboard the ship but her character arc adds a layer of believability to the overall experience.

Sandro Alimander is a Togrulan musician who is on board the Halcyon to catch a glimpse of his favorite musical superstar Gaya. Sandro is predominantly found in the Atrium strumming his guitar and slowly becomes infatuated with Ouannii. The relationship between Sandro and Ouannii was one of the most satisfying yet subtle storylines of the entire experience. While the love story between the two is direct and linear it was fun and enjoyable to see the characters literally make music together ultimately performing their new composition together during Day 2’s dessert party. Call me a sap if you want but as someone who’s musically inclined I was drawn to this story of the two improvising song lyrics and melodies together even though it was not thrust upon me by the Datapad.

The Saja are guardians of the knowledge and teachings of The Force. There are a number of Saja on board and for those theater buffs out there these actors would be considered part of the background ensemble or perhaps swing roles. The Saja are onboard to protect and teach the ways of the Force. While the Saja are not Jedi they can sense The Force in others and help them to make their own connection to the mystical power. The Saja are the ones who will lead your Lightsaber Training and are also seen roaming around the ship in the shadows. Since we did not have our Lightsaber Training until the afternoon of Day 2 our interactions with these characters were more limited. We did observe the Saja moving around the ship with other lead characters on Day 1 but they were playing a more passive role and acting as guests’ connection to those storylines if they had already interacted with the Saja earlier in the voyage.

If you’re on the Galactic Starcruiser you almost certainly know who Chewbacca is. When he makes his way aboard the Halcyon his appearances around the ship draw the most attention. Guests who follow Sammie’s character are bound to come face to face with the Wookie at some point during Day 1 and Chewie plays an integral role in the grand finale on Day 2.

Like Chewie Rey is another well-known character from the movies but her boarding of the Halcyon on Day 2 is a bit more subtle. We managed to catch her when she first boarded the ship as well as a scene in the Lightsaber Training Pod where she reveals what has brought her to the Halcyon. While Leia will always be the OG Disney Princess in the Star Wars Universe it’s clear that Rey has a clear connection with young girls as we observed during her boarding scene.

Kylo Ren is another familiar character who makes an impressive appearance but not until the Day 2 grand finale. Unfortunately guests do not interact directly with the Supreme Leader of the First Order as his role in the Halcyon’s story is to be the “Big Baddie” representing the imminent threat that must be dealt with in the story’s final act.

Instead of interacting with Kylo Ren guests with more of a dark side can follow the stories of First Order Lieutenant Harman Croy. Lt. Croy is the guests’ link to and personification of the First Order and fans of bad guys will find him extremely appealing brooding British accent and all.

However Croy does appear to have a bit of an eye for Gaya whether he’s being mesmerized by her features and voice or if his intentions are true was unclear to us. I had initially intended to try to stick with a First Order storylines but I think my desire to try to also explore other storylines kept me from getting the full bad guy experience. I spoke to other passengers who had committed fully to this path and they said it was very rewarding right down to some downright hilarious interactions with their cabin’s personal droid D3-O9.

First Order Colonel Gav Talis is next in line behind General Hux (fans need to remember that Hux’s betrayal of the First Order has not happened yet while we’re on Batuu and the Halcyon). Talis appears on screens on the bridge and gives orders to Croy but we never saw this character in person.

When the First Order boards the ship Stormtroopers can also be seen roaming around various locations seemingly just missing Resistance characters thanks to crew and passenger distractions. While passengers see two Stormtroopers marching around the Halcyon on Day 1 their numbers double midway through Day 2 to indicate the intensification of the First Order threat.

Like a murder mystery dinner theater or Disney’s Adventurer’s Club plot points and storylines are revealed to guests through the character driven journey. The talents on display throughout our voyage were impeccable and the improvisational skills of the performers were incredible. The ability to simultaneously interact and connect with guests approaching these stories from different backgrounds experiences and feelings towards the Star Wars Universe takes some serious acting chops and their efforts should not go unnoticed.

Here is Cory Rouse from Walt Disney Imagineering to talk about the characters on the Star Wars Galactic Starcruiser at Walt Disney World.

In the session a panel of experts including two Disney animation legends reflect on their careers the making of the classic animated film Beauty and the Beast (1991) and the lasting legacy and impact of Disney on American culture. Glen Keane Animation Director Glen Keane Productions and Supervising Animator of The Beast in the film along with Don Hahn Producer and Director Walt Disney Animation Studios and Carmenita D. Higginbotham Dean Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts join moderator Wolf Burchard Associate Curator European Sculpture and Decorative Arts The Met to discuss the film and it’s 18th century influences.

For those who couldn’t make the in-person panel the MET also streamed it live on their YouTube and Facebook pages.

The panel focuses primarily on the 1991 Walt Disney Animation Studios film Beauty and the Beast and some of the behind the scenes history regarding its production. Briefly at the beginning of the presentation host and moderator Wolf Burchard shares the influences of 18th century European art specifically the Rococo period and furniture designs including a familiar looking candelabra. Burchard also shares his appreciation for the laborious process of the art of animation and even showcases a specific wall in the exhibit that features 24 individual drawings from the dress transformation sequence from Cinderella representing the draftsmanship that goes into these productions for only a single second of film.

Once Glen Keane and Don Hahn take the stage alongside Burchard and Higginbotham the talk turns to the production of the film touching upon production hiccups like the (now more commonplace) story about the far more humanized less-magic and enchanted furniture original version of the film. Those who aren’t too familiar with the production of the film will delight in these tales but anybody with any DVD or Blu-Ray copies of the film will recognize most of this content from the bonus features on their discs. We also didn’t get much input from producer Don Hahn as his audio was disconnected for his virtual appearance during most of the panel discussion. The focus was then on Glen Keane and his iconic animated sequence of the transformation of the Beast. The story goes that he only had a week to do it based on the official production schedule but Hahn knew how important that scene would be and allowed him to take the time he needed to get it done. In fact the story has been told numerous times before and be found in the video below in a more succinct fashion sharing the influence that master artists before him had on his work.

The Sunday at the MET feature also showcases Keane taking to a sketchpad and sharing the inspiration of the Beast character and its roots in a taxidermy buffalo head purchased by Hahn who then tried to include it in an expense report. The session ends at this point but we are reminded that there are only a few more days left to enjoy the exhibit at the MET.

From the official MET website:

Pink castles talking sofas and objects coming to life: what sounds like fantasies from the pioneering animation of Walt Disney Animation Studios were in fact the figments of the colorful salons of Rococo Paris. The Met’s first-ever exhibition exploring the work of Walt Disney and the hand-drawn animation of Walt Disney Animation Studios will examine Disney’s personal fascination with European art and the use of French motifs in his films and theme parks drawing new parallels between the studios’ magical creations and their artistic models.

Sixty works of 18th-century European decorative arts and design—from tapestries and furniture to Boulle clocks and Sèvres porcelain—will be featured alongside 150 production artworks and works on paper from the Walt Disney Animation Research Library Walt Disney Archives Walt Disney Imagineering Collection and The Walt Disney Family Museum. Selected film footage illustrating the extraordinary technological and artistic developments of the studio during Disney’s lifetime and beyond will also be shown.

The exhibition will highlight references to European visual culture in Disney animated films including nods to Gothic Revival architecture in Cinderella (1950) medieval influences on Sleeping Beauty (1959) and Rococo-inspired objects brought to life in Beauty and the Beast (1991). The exhibition also marks the 30th anniversary of the animated theatrical release of Beauty and the Beast.

Regarding the exhibition and Beauty and the Beast a series of galleries has been devoted to the 199 film which Walt Disney himself had suggested for animation in the 1940s and 1950s. The famous tale was first published in 1740 by Suzanne-Gabrielle Barbot de Villeneuve although a later abridged adaptation (1756) by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont is more widely known.

This expansive section explores topics of anthropomorphism and zoomorphism in 18th-century French literature and decorative arts Disney’s satirical take on Rococo fashion the interiors of the movie’s enchanted castle and the design and animation of the Beast and other characters. On view is a touching 16th-century portrait lent by Ambras Castle in Innsbruck Austria of Magdalena González which has been associated with the story of Beauty and the Beast for generations.

Young Magdalena was afflicted with a genetic condition causing the entirety of her body to be covered in unusual amounts of hair; her and her family’s story was one of alienation and oppression. Preparatory movie sketches shown alongside 18th-century clocks candlesticks and teapots (evoking the characters of Cogsworth Lumiere and Mrs. Potts from the movie) will illustrate the ways in which both Disney animators and Rococo craftspeople sought to breathe life into what is essentially inanimate. Highlights also include a clock on pedestal by André Charles Boulle gilt-bronze candlesticks by Juste-Aurèle Meissonnier and early Meissen teapots including an anthropomorphic one of a bearded man riding a miniature dolphin as well as a pair of Sèvres elephant vases designed by Jean-Claude Chambellan Duplessis.

Particular focus is given to the aforementioned Beast’s transformation scene inspired by sculptor Auguste Rodin’s The Burghers of Calais as well as the ballroom scene whose vast architectural backdrop drew on the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles.

Inspiring Walt Disney: The Animation of French Decorative Arts is on view now at The Met and is scheduled to run through March 6th 2022. You can take a look at more of the exhibit during our experience here."

Last night I reported that Warner Bros. Discovery chief David Zaslav had zeroed in on his choice for the next President of CNN. I also reported that star executive producer Chris Licht formerly of Morning Joe and CBS This Morning and now the person in charge of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert had emerged as a top contender for the position formerly occupied by Jeff Zucker. I can now report based on conversations with sources who have spoken directly with Zaslav that Licht is indeed the person who Zaslav has selected to run CNN.

Licht will run CNN as head of news for Warner Bros. Discovery a source familiar with the matter said. Unlike Zucker his purview will not extend to sports.

Licht whose deal with CBS expires in April will run CNN as head of news for Warner Bros. Discovery Puck first reported. Unlike Zucker Licht’s purview won’t extend to sports.

The deal is expected to be announced at — or before — a special Discovery shareholders meeting on March 11.

Licht who is well-regarding in the television industry also previously worked as executive producer of CBS’s “This Morning” and MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”

CNN has been plagued by a cascade of recent high-profile scandals and steep ratings declines.

Jeff Zucker suddenly resigned after it was revealed he had a relationship with another executive at the network that he had failed to disclose. Getty Images

That rough patch was capped off Feb. 2 when Zucker resigned from the network after he failed to disclose a romantic relationship with another senior executive at the company.

Zucker who has helmed the cable network for nine years told colleagues in a memo his relationship with CNN’s executive vice president and chief marketing officer Allison Gollust came up during a probe into Chris Cuomo.

“As part of the investigation into Chris Cuomo’s tenure at CNN I was asked about a consensual relationship with my closest colleague someone I have worked with for more than 20 years” Zucker wrote in the memo shared on Twitter by CNN’s chief media correspondent Brian Stelter.

“I acknowledged the relationship evolved in recent years” he wrote. “I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn’t. I was wrong. As a result I am resigning today.”

Discovery boss David Zaslav had also been considering CNN Executive Vice President of Programming Michael Bass CBS News president David Rhodes and others to replace Zucker.

Discovery and Licht did not return messages.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8yNi9tZWRpYS9saWNodC1jbm4tcHJlc2lkZW50LXp1Y2tlci9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFDaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMi8wMi8yNi9tZWRpYS9saWNodC1jbm4tcHJlc2lkZW50LXp1Y2tlcg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chris Licht has been selected as next president of CNN,"New York CNN Business —

Chris Licht the producer who created “Morning Joe” revamped “CBS This Morning” and revitalized “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” has been selected to run CNN once Discovery merges with WarnerMedia this spring according to three sources with knowledge of the plan.

The parties involved have not yet commented on the anticipated appointment. But Licht’s hiring will be announced next week one of the sources said.

Licht is currently the executive producer and showrunner of “The Late Show” and executive vice president of special programming at ViacomCBS consulting on programming across the company.

Licht has more than two decades of television news experience. He has a reputation as a hands-on producer and talent manager with a keen interest in politics and news.

He has a contract with CBS that ends in April one of the sources said which aligns with Discovery’s plans.

AT&T (T) CNN’s current owner is preparing to spin off CNN and the rest of WarnerMedia in the coming weeks. Then Warner and Discovery will come together and Discovery CEO David Zaslav will run the newly formed Warner Bros. Discovery. The merger is expected to take effect in April.

Zaslav has been discussing potential candidates to run CNN sources said in the weeks since longtime CNN boss Jeff Zucker was forced out about a month ago.

Zucker abruptly departed on February 2 after he admitted to a consensual romantic relationship with his longtime No. 2 Allison Gollust. Corporate policy requires such a relationship to be disclosed to human resources which Zucker and Gollust had not previously done.

The Zucker revelations stemmed from an internal probe that started when prime time anchor Chris Cuomo was fired last December.

Gollust exited CNN in mid-February. WarnerMedia said an investigation found “violations of Company policies including CNN’s News Standards and Practices by Jeff Zucker Allison Gollust and Chris Cuomo.” The company has not detailed the violations and Gollust’s representatives have defended her conduct.

Since the shakeup three veteran CNN executives have been running the news network on an interim basis.

With Licht Zaslav would be bringing fresh eyes to CNN mirroring what sources said at the time of Zucker’s exit: That Discovery executives view Zucker’s departure as a “fresh start” for the news organization.

Unlike Zucker who oversaw both news and sports assets for WarnerMedia Licht’s role will have him exclusively overseeing news according to one of the sources.

Licht’s impending promotion was first reported by Dylan Byers of Puck who called Licht “the wunderkind producer of his generation with an ability to win over talent and see value where others don’t.”

Licht’s journalism roots are in local news. He worked at KNBC the powerhouse NBC affiliate in Los Angeles during the O.J. Simpson trial. He later worked for NBC’s affiliate in San Francisco. In 2005 he joined MSNBC as the executive producer for MSNBC’s “Scarborough Country” hosted by Joe Scarborough. Then he built a morning show around Scarborough and colleagues occasionally even appearing on-air from the control room.

In 2011 Licht leapt to CBS and engineered “CBS This Morning” a brand new production of CBS News. He moved to “The Late Show” in 2016 and has worked closely with Colbert ever since.

At “The Late Show” Licht has leaned hard into the news often booking political guests and creating live events after presidential addresses.

When Russia invaded Ukraine “The Late Show” adjusted its lineup and added a subject matter expert for Colbert to interview.

CNN’s up-to-the-minute coverage of the war has won praise from Discovery executives in recent days.

“I’ve been watching a lot of CNN” Zaslav said on an investor call on Thursday. While other news channels have people “sitting behind desks and giving their opinion about what’s going on” he said CNN is “on the ground with journalists in bulletproof vests and helmets that are doing what journalists do best which is fight to tell the truth in dangerous places. So that we all can be safe and we can assess what’s going on.”

Zaslav called it a “proud moment” for the network.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9idWNjYW5lZXJzLXF1YXJ0ZXJiYWNrLXJ5YW4tZ3JpZmZpbi1tYXJyaWVzLTEzMzEyMTIwMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Buccaneers Quarterback Ryan Griffin Marries Marissa Boyd: 'On Cloud Nine!',"NFL star Ryan Griffin is a married man!

The facility Monarch Waste Treatment AL LLC. was required by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management to hold the meeting which took place at City Hall.

Bob Blom a local businessman is bringing the facility to the area along with MWT founder David Cardenas.

“We wanted to make sure everybody understands the business we are wanting to bring here to Rainbow City” Blom said of the meeting. “We were looking to provide an educational session and make sure we answer every question.”

The plan is for the facility to dispose of non-human medical waste such as expired medications and IV bags. Cardenas said under no circumstances would it accept “animal waste body parts fetuses or hazardous waste” for disposal.

“We are planning to handle health care materials that are no longer of value” Blom said “These items are actually regulated under the State of Alabama through ADEM where they are managed.”

Those at the meeting pointed out online articles that implied MWT’s New Mexico plant had taken in aborted fetuses at one point through a former partner. The articles implied this was causing odors which forced the company to renegotiate contracts and called it a “primary incineration company.”

However Cardenas insisted that he and his family were very much “pro-life with a conviction against that (abortion)” saying he called those news sources seeking retractions.

“We cut him off when we heard what he was doing” he said of the former partner. “It’s part of our protocol and our prerogative to not take that waste from abortion clinics.”

He said his New Mexico plant doesn’t accept any human or animal waste because it's located on tribal land and it would be in opposition to the residents’ beliefs plus the land is also federally regulated.

“We were limited in the amount of trucks we could have there every day. and tribal beliefs started changing what we could bring in” he said. “So we cut that completely off and we lost a lot of clients but gained a lot of traction in pharmaceuticals because they were not exclusionary.”

Cardenas explained that the waste brought to the facility would be broken down in the form of pyrolysis a process the company’s environmental consultant Melissa Shahzadeh explained virtually to those at the meeting.

“It’s a thermal chemical conversion process that takes place in an anaerobic environment” she said. “Essentially what we’re talking about here is the breaking down of complex substances.”

Shahzadeh said pyrolysis does not involve any open flames or incineration as the product being broken down for disposal is not subjected to all the necessary ingredients to start a fire.

“As you increase the temperature inside the box you have that environment in the substance will not begin to burn because there is no air in it” she said. “Instead it’s going to start to decompose.”

Shahzadeh said one of the most intriguing things about pyrolysis is the way the process channels release gases to sustain the reactions.

“As the feedstock goes through the process some of it ends up as a process and others as a gas” she said “As they recombine into other compounds it creates the fuel necessary to sustain the reaction so we are able to channel the gasses to keep the reaction going.”

The solid byproduct of the reaction something Shahzadeh called “pyrolytic carbon char” is “essentially” ash.

“There’s nothing alive in it and nothing is contaminated” she said “The last time we tested the char in New Mexico we tested for 132 contaminants listed by the EPA. Out of those 104 were not present in any detectable quantity. Of the remaining 28 they were significantly below the EPA’s threshold of concern which makes our byproduct clean.”

Blom also showcased before-and-after samples of what the waste would turn into through this process showing them to residents in airtight containers.

“We have two containers one full of vitamins with no controls and one container of char” he said. “This represents a 92% reduction rate of this material to its simplest nontoxic form. From a volume metrics standpoint it’s one-tenth of what it (was).”

Blom said some of these materials would come in packaging such as cardboard boxes or blister packs made of plastic which also be broken down in this process.

Residents brought up a concern about microplastics such as “polyethylene oil-based carbons nopaline and cyclic organic compounds” that would not break down as easily in the process instead turning into tar.

Shahzadeh refuted that saying the materials wouldn’t turn into tar but would further combine into the elements that become the gaseous fuel to feed the reaction.

“We can guarantee that these byproducts not wanted in the environment do break down with the process” she said. “When we went through the emissions testing in New Mexico we were 39% below all EPA thresholds for any contaminants that would confirm that these do not escape our process.”

All three presenters assured those in attendance that the emissions coming from this facility would be next to none. In fact Blom said they are projected to be so low that MWT isn’t required to file an air permit at this time. (He said this could change once final testing is completed but is not likely to.)

The facility also would not be placing any waste within waterways given tate and federal regulations in place against pharmaceuticals in water.

Cardenas said the facility is designed to be a continuous process; plans are for it to be open 24/6 closed on Sunday. Nothing will be exported either. It strictly will be waste brought in from their partners via licensed transferrers.

“These trucks are small and we have constricted hours for delivery so you won’t have 18-wheelers lined up all down the street trying to get into our facility” he said. “These trucks are also smaller and we usually get one every two days. There’s no waiting to get into gates like Tyson or larger companies.”

Blom added “You have to be a registered regulated medical waste transporter in the state to be able to pick up and transport that material. If it's a ‘control’ you have to be registered to move that container. There are transporters who have that file for transport and those are the people that we use.”

Cardenas said this waste — statistically 70% to 80% pharmaceutical waste — would be delivered to the facility in containers typically seen in doctor’s offices or in red bags. They would not be sorting through all the waste; he said there are several other ways to identify what is inside the containers.

Cardenas said the new facility would bring at least 15 new jobs to the area with extensive training but did not yet have information on wages and benefits for future employees. He also assured those present that the facility would be a safe place to work citing Shahzadeh’s initial work testing for radiation.

PUBLIC MEETING:Public awareness meeting slated for medical waste treatment facility in Rainbow City

“It was not only for my own safety but it was also because I wanted to see the radioactivity I was testing” Shahzadeh said. “I tested every shipment that came in for these levels and at least twice a shift. We found that on average the radiation in my home was higher than at the facility because of it being at a lower altitude. In all the ways it was negligible.”

She added that there are protocols in place against radiation in the event they do find themselves in a position to be exposed at a higher level.

Blom added that the facility would have an “open door policy” and allow residents to tour the facility in an open house once it is ready. However Cardenas said that residents would not be allowed to touch anything inside for safety reasons.

Mayor Joe Taylor said earlier in the week that he felt “very comfortable” with bringing the facility to Rainbow City citing very low emission levels and describing it as “a clean environmentally safe industry for the city.”

“This has only been solidified knowing that the public had the chance to come out and ask their questions” he added “I just wanted to make sure that there were really no emissions coming out of this and there appear to be none.”

Taylor thought that overall the public hearing went well and that residents have been very receptive to MWT coming to Rainbow City.

“I only have had one person come to my office that had some concern but overall the public has been very positive” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MDcyNTQ3OS9ob3ctdG8tZGVzaWduLWFuLWVmZmVjdGl2ZS1nbG9iYWwtdHJlYXR5LXRvLWN1cmItcGxhc3RpYy1wb2xsdXRpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to actually address plastic pollution with a global treaty,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.fastcompany.com/90725479/how-to-design-an-effective-global-treaty-to-curb-plastic-pollution on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MDcyNTQ3OS9ob3ctdG8tZGVzaWduLWFuLWVmZmVjdGl2ZS1nbG9iYWwtdHJlYXR5LXRvLWN1cmItcGxhc3RpYy1wb2xsdXRpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9uaWdlcmlhcy1wbGFzdGljLXBvbGx1dGlvbi1pcy1oYXJtaW5nLXRoZS1lbnZpcm9ubWVudC1zdGVwcy10by1jb21iYXQtaXQtYXJlLW92ZXJkdWUtMTc3ODM50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nigeria's plastic pollution is harming the environment: steps to combat it are overdue,"A key theme at this year’s United Nations Environment Assembly in Kenya is plastic pollution. It will be returning to a theme from 2018 World Environment Day. The evidence for the prevalence and consequences of plastic pollution has been building up and the assembly needs to lead action on this issue.

Individuals communities businesses and governments all have a part to play to reduce plastic pollution in their environments.

The 2018 World Environment Day provided much-needed impetus for some countries to launch or appraise their plastic pollution initiatives. An example is India which committed itself to proscribing and eliminating all single-use plastics in all Indian states by 2022. Many Indian states have keyed into this initiative and a national ban on most single-use plastics is due to take effect from 1 July 2022.

Unfortunately Nigeria hasn’t done much in this regard. Compared to other developing countries such as Kenya Rwanda Uganda and Tanzania its commitments to combating plastic pollution are far below average.

Plastic pollution thrives in Nigeria

Lagos Nigeria’s megacity of nearly 16 million people produces between 13000 and 15000 tonnes of waste per day including 2250 tonnes of plastic according to a local recycling business.

Nigerian lawmakers considered a bill in 2019 to prohibit the use of plastic bags. The bill is still in limbo. It is yet to undergo further reading and has not been enacted into law. Consequently plastic bags are being indiscriminately used in Nigeria.

The evidence of the harm this does is mounting.

My research group published the first empirical finding of freshwater microplastics in Nigeria. We used snails from the Osun River in southwest Nigeria as biological indicators of plastic pollution. Snails in the river had consumed polyethylene plastic bags which were common along riverbanks.

We have also found plastic polymers such as polyester polypropylene acrylonitrile butadiene styrene styrene-ethylene butylene styrene and chlorinated polyethylene in the Osun and Ogun Rivers. The plastic polymers recorded in our study are traceable to different sources such as textiles biscuit wrappers automotive tyre cords bottle caps and drinking straws. We also saw larger items in the rivers such as tyres plastic bags and plastic bottles. Studies indicate that such plastics could affect the life history survival growth and development of insect larvae into adults.

Our studies of plastic pollution in Nigeria particularly freshwater and marine environments have recorded plastics in fish too.

Effects of plastics

When animals ingest plastics it blocks the gut and windpipe and reduces their physiological fitness. Aquatic animals can also become entangled in plastics resulting in malnutrition and death.

Plastics degrade the aesthetic value of Nigerian landscapes and aquatic systems. This compromises cultural ecosystem services such as ecotourism.

Read more: Lagos beaches have a microplastic pollution problem

Plastic pollution has become such a serious problem in Nigeria that it has virtually become a sign of human activity or visits to a location. People who visit beaches riverbanks parks and waterfalls frequently dump their plastic bottles carelessly despite the dangers that such plastics pose to the environment.

In one case plastic bottles were found at a natural site where an ecologically important rare insect was found.

Our studies show that plastic can affect the water-holding capacity of drains river channels and reservoirs. This leads to flooding of adjacent lands and loss of biological diversity and livelihoods.

Losing natural sites to plastic pollution also means people don’t get the health benefits of outdoor activity.

Action to end plastic pollution in Nigeria

Combating plastic pollution in Nigeria will require action on several fronts.

The first step will be to address poor waste management practices prevalent in the country.

Also businesses will have to stop providing free plastic bags. These bags are often discarded after a single use.

Read more: Kenya should be focused on recycling not banning plastic bags

To discourage the practice governments should levy a high fee on each plastic bag that shoppers get at malls and markets. Paying for a bag could discourage people from discarding them after a single use. Paper bags used in Uganda should be encouraged. Since packaging is the leading cause of plastic pollution in the environment the Nigerian government needs to launch a campaign and crack down on plastic bags and bottles in the country. The public will need to be educated on the three Rs: reduce recycle and reuse plastic materials.

Water sachets and bottles have proliferated in Nigeria due to a lack of drinkable water in many homes. The government needs to educate the public about the dangers of discarding water sachets and bottles in the environment. And it must ensure access to clean water.

Whatever strategy the government employs will be ineffective unless the long-awaited “plastic pollution bill” is passed by Nigerian legislators and swiftly signed into law.

Citizens and leaders have the responsibility of bequeathing an environment that future Nigerians can be proud of. Kenya Uganda Tanzania Rwanda and other countries have taken steps to protect their environments from more plastic pollution. Nigeria can no longer afford to wait.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZlb2xpYS5jb20vbWlkZGxlZWFzdC9vdXItc2VydmljZXMvb3VyLXZpc2lvbi9vdXItcmVmZXJlbmNlcy9uYXdhaC1iYXJha2FoLW51Y2xlYXItcG93ZXItcGxhbnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nawah - Barakah Nuclear Power Plant,"| The challenge

Established in 2016 Nawah Energy Company (Nawah) will operate and maintain Units 1 to 4 at the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant the first nuclear energy plant in the UAE and the region located in the Al Dhafra region Abu Dhabi.

Veolia has been contracted to provide complete waste management and industrial services onsite under a high security zone.

A comprehensive and innovative waste management approach was imminent as BNPP is first of its kind in the Middle East and Veolia expertise needed to be at the core of the waste management operations on site.

| Veolia’s solution

Veolia has provided Nawah energy company with high quality waste management services in high security zoning with dedicated manpower and specialized fleet of vehicles and equipment.

Baling solutions for recyclables onsite in developed and deployed. This increases the hauling efficiency by decreasing the volume occupied by the materials.

Onsite industrial services such as preliminary sludge separations units are deployed to bring in financial efficiency to the customer and eventually reducing the carbon footprint by diverting the sludges from incineration processes.

| The benefits

Veolia has been working with Nuclear power plants all over the world to support their critical environmental services divisions and have core expertise when it comes to delivering sustainable environmentally friendly safe and optimized operations for its customers specially Nuclear power plants.

One of the initiatives Veolia has taken is to deploy electric vehicles on site i.e. Electric forklift to reduce the carbon footprint on site and bring in financial efficiency for the customer at the same time.

Veolia has provided Nawah with much needed support on developing waste management and industrial services plans on site as the site is recently developed and is one of the first Nuclear Power Plants in the region. Veolia expertise to support the development of the environmental services was crucial and remain of great importance.

As part of the continual improvement process Veolia is not only supporting Nawah with its waste management planning but also brining it much needed operational and financial efficiencies by reducing the waste volumes for disposal by providing preliminary treatment on site.

For such critical and high profile site Veolia has made sure to provide enough standby resources to support waste management services at Nawah and made sure of business continuity.

Veolia will continue to support Nawah with its growing operations and are fully capable of expanding its services volume as and when required.

The projects are expected to be set up on the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model according to SIRC's press statement posted on its website.

The statement posted on Sunday 28 February said the solution would enable the entire Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) value chain from sorting at source to the collection transportation treatment and recycling and include sorting and recycling stations waste-to-energy and alternative fuel (Refuse Derived Fuel) production plants and composting facilities.

SIRC along with the private sector will develop the ecosystem under the rules and regulations of the National Centre for Waste Management (MWAN) the statement noted adding that companies should register their interest on SIRC's website at https://sirc.sa/company-registration-form/

SIRC has set a target to divert 94 percent of MSW from landfills by 2035 according to the Saudi Green Initiative.

In November 2020 local English-language newspaper Arab News had reported that nearly half of the total waste generated in the Kingdom comes from three major cities namely Riyadh (21 percent) Jeddah (14 percent) and Dammam (8 percent).

Salmon all but disappeared from the 2000-mile (3200-km) Yukon River run last year as record-high temperatures led to the fish piling up dead in streams and rivers before they were able to spawn. A study published Feb. 15 in the journal Fisheries detailed more than 100 salmon die-offs at freshwater sites around Alaska.

Those losses meant that even as temperatures were milder in 2021 the Yukon River salmon runs remained so anemic that both Alaska and Canada were forced to halt their salmon harvest to ensure enough fish survived to reproduce for another year.

""Alaska is known for salmon and being cold"" said Vanessa von Biela a U.S. Geological Survey research biologist and lead author of the study on the 2019 die-offs. Now ""we have basically the problems that have been known for a long time at the lower latitudes.""

The collapsed Yukon River salmon harvests delivered financial blows to both commercial fishers and indigenous communities which traditionally stockpile the fish as a year-round food staple.

Commercially the river's salmon fishers altogether earned a mere $51480 for their 2020 harvest before the harvest was canceled in 2021. By comparison they earned $2.5 million in 2019 and $4.67 million in 2018.

Last month the U.S. commerce secretary declared a disaster for the Yukon River fishery for both years making federal relief funds available.

The state sent emergency fish shipments last year from the more plentiful salmon in Bristol Bay and elsewhere.

Scientists mostly have blamed ocean warming with a series of heat waves in the Bering Sea and North Pacific Ocean from 2014 to 2019 affecting salmon living in the sea before their return to spawning grounds.

While the heat waves have passed their effects have not said fisheries scientist Katie Howard with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. ""We're still seeing the residual effects"" she told a state legislative committee in Anchorage earlier this month.

Climate change may also be affecting salmon diets with young salmon possibly filling up on nutrition-poor food like jellyfish as warmer waters in the Bering Sea drive away the more nutritious zooplankton the fish eat normally.

""In my opinion the salmon are starving with climate change"" said Brooke Woods the chair of the Yukon River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission from the Athabascan village of Rampart.

But the impact on freshwater habitats is also getting a closer look.

Previous research led by von Biela on the rivers streams and lakes where salmon spend their early and late life stages the team found that Chinook salmon show heat stress at temperatures above 18 Celsius (64.4 Fahrenheit) and start dying above 20C.

Alaskan Yukon water temperatures in the past ranged between 12C and 16C with Canadian monitoring sites upriver measuring even cooler waters. But in 2019 temperatures on the Alaskan side were above 18C for 44 consecutive days the February study found.

The warming impact can be muted by climate-driven glacier runoff which feeds cooler water into rivers and streams.

Scientists expect salmon will gradually shift to new areas within Alaska with profound effects for people who depend on the fish for their livelihoods diet and culture.

""Salmon will find a way"" von Biela said. ""But it is going to be hard for communities that are in places where there might not be salmon anymore.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91dGxvb2tpbmRpYS5jb20vbmF0aW9uYWwvc29vbi1maXNoaW5nLWJvYXRzLWluLWtlcmFsYS10by1ydW4tb24tbHBnLW5ld3MtMTg0MzMx0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub3V0bG9va2luZGlhLmNvbS9hbXAvc3RvcnkvbmF0aW9uYWwvc29vbi1maXNoaW5nLWJvYXRzLWluLWtlcmFsYS10by1ydW4tb24tbHBnLW5ld3MtMTg0MzMx?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Soon Fishing Boats In Kerala To Run On LPG,"""A boat powered by a 10 HP engine normally requires six to 10 litres of kerosene for one-hour operation.

A Wells Fargo Bank branch in New York

Wells Fargo has poached HSBC’s European head of real estate finance as it eyes expansion.

Nicola Free previously a managing director at AIG for over six years brings over 16 years of experience to the position from across UK and US institutions.

Leaving HSBC after more than three years at the banking heavyweight Free is set to use her extensive client network to bolster the US-headquartered bank.

Free formerly vice president of Bank of America and Merill Lynch has emerged a key figurehead in the financial services space.

Wells Fargo which employs around 268500 people globally is looking to widen its commercial real estate finance business in Europe.

The path between HSBC and Wells Fargo is well-trodden with the pair launching a blockchain-based FX settlement platform late last year.

HSBC last year snagged the former executive vice president of Wells Fargo as its new head of global banking in Europe based in London.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL2hlYXJ0bGFuZC5vcmcvcHVibGljYXRpb25zL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC1pbnN0aXR1dGlvbnMtYXJlLWV4cGFuZGluZy1lc2ctc29jaWFsLWNyZWRpdC1zY29yZXMtdG8tdGFyZ2V0LWluZGl2aWR1YWxzLXNtYWxsLWJ1c2luZXNzZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are Financial Institutions Using ESG Social Credit Scores to Coerce Individuals Small Businesses? – The Heartland ...,"Environmental social and governance (ESG) metrics are a kind of social credit system designed to coerce businesses—and by extension individuals and all of society—to transform their practices.

Through a carrot-and-stick approach investors and banks (and soon governments) use ESG to push businesses to change how they function regardless of what the employees and customers of those businesses want. In many cases however corporate executives are all too willing to go along because they want access to the cheap capital offered by investors and financial institutions.

The widespread adoption of ESG metrics which is also commonly called “stakeholder capitalism”—is meant to radically alter how businesses are evaluated expanding considerations beyond traditional economic metrics like profit revenue debt customer satisfaction and product development.

Instead of looking at economic and financial considerations ESG social credit metrics measure things like “Percentage of active workforce covered under collective bargaining agreements” (union labor) and “Percentage of employees per employee category by age group gender and other indicators of diversity (e.g. ethnicity).”

(To learn more about the basics of ESG read my ESG primer here or watch my recorded presentation for The Heartland Institute here.)

Unlike many corporations which spend substantial time and resources self-reporting ESG individual investors and most small businesses typically do not produce their own ESG reports. Instead large financial services companies and banks have produced them for these groups often without individuals or businesses asking for the reports.

For instance Merrill Lynch a division of Bank of America produces ESG scores for all or nearly all of its individual investment accounts even for those whose value is $1000 or less.

Moody’s has created an “ESG Score Predictor” that offers users with ESG reports for 100000 businesses many of which have never produced their own ESG metrics. Moody’s algorithm predicts scores by using “company size location and industry as inputs.”

When individuals and small businesses have raised concerns about the use of ESG and how it could be used against them—as opposed to merely being applied to corporations for the benefit of investors—banks investment groups and their lobbyists have claimed that concerns over ESG are nothing but “conspiracy theories.”

However the evidence shows that there are very good reasons to believe that financial institutions and banks plan to dramatically expand the use of ESG soon for individuals families and small businesses a move that would dramatically change the U.S. economy and society. Below are the five most important reasons for all Americans to be concerned.

1. There Are Already Many Examples of Individuals and Businesses Being Denied Access to Financial Services or Capital Based on Subjective Criteria

It’s impossible to know to what extent individuals organizations and businesses are now being denied access to financial services including loans based on subjective criteria because there are no databases nor reporting agencies tasked with compiling denials based on non-financial reasons. However news outlets have reported many examples of such actions and some industry reports openly admit that discrimination is common.

For example Deutsche Bank AG and Signature Bank announced in early 2021 that would no longer provide services to former President Donald Trump or his business the Trump Organization purely for ideological reasons.

In November 2021 WePay a J.P. Morgan Chase-owned payment processor informed the Missouri-based Defense of Liberty political action committee that it would stop offering its services to the organization after it planned an event featuring Donald Trump Jr. (Chase later reversed the decision but only after “Missouri treasurer Scott Fitzpatrick threatened to have the state stop doing business with the bank.”)

According to former North Dakota lawmaker Bette Grande “During the 2021 legislative session in North Dakota representatives of the lignite industry testified that coal operations are seeing increasing insurance premiums and a drop in the number of insurance companies willing to write insurance for any price. This is the ESG movement in action and it will not stop with oil and coal.”

Also in 2021 Sustainalytics an ESG business owned by Morningstar published a report titled How Sustainable Finance is Shaping Change in Banking. In the publication Sustainalytics notes:

Most major banks screen their lending portfolios against specific ESG risks as per the OECD Due Diligence guidance and many embrace negative or positive screening for potential corporate lending transactions or project finance transactions. Screening strategies filter potential transactions using predetermined ESG criteria to rule companies in or out of contention for financing. Negative screening and norm-based screening involve the exclusion or avoidance of transactions not aligned with environmental social and ethical standards. Exclusion criteria often include issues like weapon manufacturing tobacco sales or production of fossil fuels. While negative and norm-based screening are the most popular techniques used for ESG asset management these practices have been losing traction since 2015.

Positive screening on the other hand selects corporate borrowers that score highly on ESG factors relative to their peers. This can include best-in-class screening or the inclusion of investments in companies and sectors with higher ESG scores as compared to their peers or companies that are actively improving their ESG performance. This screening method does not necessarily exclude ESG laggards but rather focuses on those performing best with regards to ESG in relation to comparable companies or industries. In comparison to corporate lending transactions the intensity of screening is often higher for project finance transactions given due diligence requirements under the Equator Principles.

In 2020 Wells Fargo suspiciously closed a bank account belonging to Lauren Witzke a 2020 Republican candidate for the Delaware Senate.

The Heritage Foundation noted in a 2021 report that “PayPal has admitted to closing accounts flagged by the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2019 now PayPal has announced a partnership with the left-leaning Anti-Defamation League to focus on ‘further uncovering and disrupting the financial pipelines that support extremist and hate movements.'”

In 2019 the New York Post reported that J.P. Morgan Chase closed bank accounts associated with several political activists and commentators including Enrique Tarrio Joe Biggs Laura Loomer and Martina Markota—all within weeks of each other. According to the Post the activists said they were not given clear explanations for the cancellations.

In 2018 some large U.S. banks including Citibank rolled out restrictions for gun manufacturers and retailers. According to a report by the New York Times “They are restricting their credit card and banking services to gun retailers and halting lending to gun makers that do not comply with age limits and background check rules determined by the banks. They are also freezing out businesses that sell high-capacity magazines and ‘bump stocks’ attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire faster even though such products are legal under federal law.”

2. Credit Agencies Have Started to Alter Businesses’ Credit Ratings Based on ESG Scores

As noted in a 2021 sweeping report by Fitch Ratings—one of the “big three credit rating agencies” (along with Moody’s and S&P)—corporate credit rating agents already take ESG scores into account. And according to Fitch and others the use of ESG to alter credit ratings will almost certainly expand in the months and years to come.

If the largest agencies are willing to use ESG to alter corporate credit scores why wouldn’t credit agencies and banks do the same for individuals and small businesses?

3. Analysts Predict Individual Credit Scores Could Soon Have an ESG Component

Perhaps the most widely used service to check the creditworthiness of individuals and small business is FICO. When banks and credit unions examine applications for loans FICO is often the first place they turn. In an article published in December 2021 on FICO’s website titled “Lending Predictions 2022: From BNPL to ESG (and More)” a FICO senior principal consultant wrote that he believes in 2022 “The ESG Agenda Will Drive the Search for Cleaner Decisions.”

“In financial institutions much of the ESG agenda is delivered at the corporate level” the analyst wrote “but in 2022 we expect to see an increased focus on bringing ESG data into more granular lending and investment decisions. This will require increased innovation in the use of alternative data across all kinds of lending. One example would be the inclusion of property energy ratings data in mortgage valuation and decisioning and CO2 emission data for small businesses.”

He also noted “Over the longer term we expect that ESG and climate risk evaluations will become an integral element of credit risk and affordability assessments.”

This is a clear admission that ESG will likely soon be applied to individual and small business credit scores and/or other considerations such as mortgage applications.

4. Large Investment Management Firms and Banks Are Using ESG to Coerce Corporations

The primary stated purpose of ESG is to change corporations especially the largest and most powerful ones in order to produce more extensive societal impacts. This point is not in dispute. Everyone who understands ESG regardless of whether they support it or not agrees that it’s being used to alter corporate activities.

If you’re looking for specific examples of this however a good place to start is Larry Fink’s 2022 “Letter to CEOs” in which Fink sings the praises of “stakeholder capitalism” and promises to use ESG scores as a way to alter society. Fink is the head of Blackrock the world’s largest asset management company and is widely considered one of the most powerful people on Wall Street if not the most powerful person.

Of course Fink attempts to put a happy face on ESG and stakeholder capitalism throughout his letter but even he can’t help himself when discussing climate change making it clear that companies must choose between being leaders or being dragged into a net-zero economy against their will.

“Every company and every industry will be transformed by the transition to a net zero world” Fink wrote. “The question is will you lead or will you be led?”

The threats from Fink and others have largely worked. Accounting firm KPMG reports thousands of companies in dozens of countries have ESG systems in place including 82 percent of large companies in the United States. (And this data is now a couple of years old.)

If investors and banks are willing to utilize ESG to control corporations why wouldn’t they use ESG to manipulate individual and small business behavior as well?

5. Banks Have Promised to Use ESG to Fight Climate Change Throughout All of Their Portfolios and Business Activities

The largest and most influential banks and financial institutions in the United States much of Europe and Canada have openly said that they will use their tremendous amount of wealth to force the global economy to move to net-zero by at least 2050 and to halve CO2 emissions by 2030. This will be done in a variety of ways including by “accelerating decarbonization in the real economy by describing financial sector expectations of transition plans from the companies the sector engages with and finances.”

One of the largest groups of banks and financial institutions promising to make such an extreme acceleration is the Glasgow Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ). There are already “over 450 financial firms across 45 countries responsible for assets of over $130 trillion” in GFANZ including numerous large U.S. banks such as Bank of America J.P. Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo & Company.

There simply is no way for banks to keep their promises related to a transition to net-zero without imposing ESG metrics or other similar criteria on individuals and small businesses.

Justin Haskins is the director of the Socialism Research Center at The Heartland Institute and the co-author of the New York Times bestselling book The Great Reset: Joe Biden and the Rise of Twenty-First Century Fascism. His opinions in this article do not reflect the views of The Heartland Institute",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJ0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9hLXNsb3ctY29tZWJhY2staW4tZG93bnRvd24tbWlubmVhcG9saXMvNjAwMTUxMjUyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A slow comeback in downtown Minneapolis,"It's a measure of just how empty downtown Minneapolis has been that a gradual tentative repopulation looks significant.

In the lobby of an office building on Nicollet Mall a sign announces (with exclamation points!) the news that several retailers on the skyway level are open. Some of the ""closed"" notices taped to storefront windows have changed to ""opening soon."" A few coffee shops like the Starbucks in the IDS Center have a line of customers waiting to place their orders.

And yet the overall impression of a visit last week during what should be the morning rush hour was one of desolation. Downtown Minneapolis still feels a bit like a mall that's about to go out of business.

The Minneapolis Downtown Council's word for what is needed is ""reanimation."" At first the word sounds gruesome recalling Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley and her classic novel about bringing dead body parts back to life. On reflection though ""reanimation"" seems apt. Downtown Minneapolis needs a jolt — something dramatic a little bit miraculous and possibly contrary to what nature would do if left to itself.

The forces that brought downtown to this point were dramatic too. Start with the COVID-19 pandemic which shuttered businesses and furloughed workers and led shoppers to remain at home. Then add the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer and the chain of events that followed.

Communities of color were terrified and outraged; people of conscience were shocked and disgusted; areas of the city were convulsed with demonstrations riots looting and arson; police were demoralized alienated and left even more understaffed than before. Crime spiked. Public safety became a goal instead of a given.

But now there are signs of progress. Estimates are that nearly 40% of downtown workers have returned. As COVID numbers decline in Minnesota and around the country several big downtown employers have announced plans to bring their workforces back. Xcel Energy Wells Fargo Ameriprise and U.S. Bank are all resuming some level of in-person staffing.

Those plans do not translate instantly into a bustling business district however. At many firms employees will commence a hybrid schedule that includes both home and office work. The prospective return of office workers is a plus for downtown but it is not likely to turn things around quickly. A reanimated finger may twitch but it will take more to put the body back on its feet.

Downtown Council President Steve Cramer told an editorial writer that office workers are just one of the drivers of the downtown economy; another driver is events like sports and professional theater.

A prime example is the NCAA Women's Final Four in early April sure to be a major draw in bringing people and visibility to downtown Minneapolis. Associated events include a festival at the Convention Center a three-day party at First Avenue and other attractions besides the tournament itself in Target Center. The Twins home opener comes the following Thursday barring a players' strike or an MLB lockout.

Big events can create what Cramer calls the ""toe-in-the-water effect"" — meaning that people who visit downtown once may find it not so bad and be more willing to come back again.

Until the public safety issues are addressed though there's a danger that some of those people will find the water full of crocodiles and pull their toes back quickly. They will be less willing to venture downtown again and so will their friends. Cramer acknowledged that downtown's future success hinges on ""the perception and the reality of public safety."" The Police Department is severely understaffed and Cramer predicted that its efforts to recruit enough new officers ""are going to take many years.""

Whether downtown can wait that long is an open question.

In his inaugural address last month the re-elected Mayor Jacob Frey said Minneapolis was ""steadily building back."" Now that the voters have reaffirmed and strengthened his role in supervising the Police Department he should continue the steady rebuilding — and where public safety is concerned pick up the pace.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3djZmNvdXJpZXIuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC93cmVzdGxpbmcvdW5pb25zLWphY2UtaGVkZW1hbi1pcy1qdXN0LWdldHRpbmctc3RhcnRlZC9hcnRpY2xlXzQxMTA0YWMyLTZiZmEtNTRmOC1iMzc1LTBhZTVmNmQ3MGNlYy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Unions Jace Hedeman is just getting started,"NOTE: This is the final part in our five part series celebrating this years state champion wrestlers.

When Jace Hedeman walked into the Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines last weekend he carried with him an undefeated record and high expectations.

He left the Arena Saturday night with both still intact.

Hedeman a freshman at Union La Porte City finished his first year of varsity wrestling with a record of 46-0 and a 1A state championship at 106 pounds. After winning his final match of the season a 7-3 decision over Notre Dames Carter West Hedeman was direct about how he was feeling.

“It feels good” he said. “I mean it’s what I expected. I knew I was going to win. I had the mindset. It feels good.”

On the first day of competition Hedeman won by Fall over Ethan Long of Monticello in 3:11. He didn’t have much trouble on Friday either as he beat Emmitt Newton of Davis County by a 5-2 decision in the quarterfinals and Colin Cassady of West Liberty by an 8-3 decision in the semis. Then came the championship win.

Hedeman joined Julian Worthen as Unions two state champions at 106 this season. The crazy thing is Hedeman is only going to keep getting better moving forward.

“Obviously there’s more to come” he said. “There’s a lot of room to improve. I didn’t set up my shots and my bottom obviously needs work.”

This coming from a kid who had just finished his year undefeated and won a state title. Still Hedeman has lofty goals for the future.

“(Going undefeated) obviously feels good” Hedeman said. “Hopefully I get the highest career wins at Union. That’s the goal. If I keep it up and keep going I think I could. I can’t stop now.”

With the guidance of Knights coaches Bart Mahler and Max Thompson Hedeman believes Union La Porte City will always be competitive.

“It’s amazing (to have those guys in my corner)” Hedeman said. “They push you so hard. Max sets our goals and so does Bart. They set our standards that high and push us as hard as they can.”

Hedeman wasn’t alone on the podium. Union sent six wrestlers to Des Moines and he was one of five that ended up placing. The freshman phenom offered nothing but praise for his teammates.

“I love those guys” Hedeman said. “They all work so hard. We all have the same goals so we push each other and we all love each other so it’s a great community.”

Hedeman said he set the goal of winning a state championship all four years before even starting his freshman season. He set lofty goals before even taking the mat for the first time. 46 matches in he’s lived up to his own high standards. If he keeps on going there’s no reason to think he won’t make history.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL215Zm94OC5jb20vbmV3cy9ub3J0aC1jYXJvbGluYS93aW5zdG9uLXNhbGVtL3BheWNoZWNrcy1mb3Itc3RhZmYtZGVsYXllZC1idXQtb24tdGhlLXdheS13aW5zdG9uLXNhbGVtLWZvcnN5dGgtY291bnR5LXNjaG9vbHMtc2F5cy_SAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly9teWZveDguY29tL25ld3Mvbm9ydGgtY2Fyb2xpbmEvd2luc3Rvbi1zYWxlbS9wYXljaGVja3MtZm9yLXN0YWZmLWRlbGF5ZWQtYnV0LW9uLXRoZS13YXktd2luc3Rvbi1zYWxlbS1mb3JzeXRoLWNvdW50eS1zY2hvb2xzLXNheXMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paychecks for staff delayed but on the way Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools says,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://myfox8.com/news/north-carolina/winston-salem/paychecks-for-staff-delayed-but-on-the-way-winston-salem-forsyth-county-schools-says/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL215Zm94OC5jb20vbmV3cy9ub3J0aC1jYXJvbGluYS93aW5zdG9uLXNhbGVtL3BheWNoZWNrcy1mb3Itc3RhZmYtZGVsYXllZC1idXQtb24tdGhlLXdheS13aW5zdG9uLXNhbGVtLWZvcnN5dGgtY291bnR5LXNjaG9vbHMtc2F5cy_SAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly9teWZveDguY29tL25ld3Mvbm9ydGgtY2Fyb2xpbmEvd2luc3Rvbi1zYWxlbS9wYXljaGVja3MtZm9yLXN0YWZmLWRlbGF5ZWQtYnV0LW9uLXRoZS13YXktd2luc3Rvbi1zYWxlbS1mb3JzeXRoLWNvdW50eS1zY2hvb2xzLXNheXMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Oh look it’s that massive highly anticipated game that everyone’s excited about! It’s only just released and it’s what all the gamers on the internet have been talking about. Wait what do you mean they’ve already forgotten about it?

Poor Aloy. Her latest adventure has been praised as an excellent sequel to 2017’s Horizon Zero Dawn and yet just over a week on from its release everyone’s already moved on to Elden Ring. I mean I can’t really say I blame them given how groundbreaking the latter is but still.

While you're here be sure to check out some gameplay footage for Horizon Forbidden West below.

Even if the attention has very quickly shifted away from it though Forbidden West is still doing really well. Not only was it the best selling boxed game in the UK last week but it was also the best-selling digital game too.

Advert

According to a report from GamesIndustry.biz the latest games sale data has shown that just short of half of the game’s sales (49% to be exact) were digital via the PSN store. Just for comparison’s sake those digital sales are double what Zero Dawn managed in March 2017 the month after its release and this is only in the span of a week.

The PS5 version of the game is continuing to be the most popular too - reportedly 67% of the digital sales were for the new-gen version. Those are really similar figures to last week’s physical sales - around two thirds of the boxed copies were for the PS5 editions. On one hand that’s hardly surprising - the game looks significantly better on there but equally anyone who buys the PS4 version which costs £10 less can upgrade for free. Be sure to keep that in mind if you’ve not already bought it yourself anyway.

As I said at the start chances are basically everyone is going to be shifting their focus over to Elden Ring now but we still think Forbidden West is worth playing - in our review we said that it “takes everything that worked in its acclaimed predecessor and builds upon it in spectacular style”. So we still love you Aloy even if your game’s release timing was a bit poor.

Horizon Zero Dawn offers up a firm critique of the United States’ eagerness to militarize technology. It imagines a future where intelligent robots built to aid the U.S. military have brought about the apocalypse. Weave in some environmental themes and you’ve got a pretty pointed take on our modern world.

With Horizon Forbidden West developer Guerilla Games continues to not pull any punches. But rather than restating its predecessor’s points it puts another target in its sights. The dystopian action game is a searing critique of big tech that takes jabs at billionaires like Jeff Bezos. It takes no prisoners in its future-ready takedown of techno-colonialism.

Meet the Zeniths

Horizon Forbidden West starts simply enough. Coming off the events of the first game Aloy is now hailed as a hero throughout the U.S. after destroying a rogue A.I. named Hades. Her work isn’t finished though. She sets out on a journey to the West Coast so she can continue her quest to save humanity.

Early on the themes are straightforward. The game once again emphasizes the importance of preserving the planet and not letting technology destroy nature. Its direction seems clear … and then the Zeniths show up.

In a bizarre midgame twist Aloy comes face to face with a trio of humans in high-tech spacesuits. The mysterious characters have seemingly impenetrable force fields and apparently nefarious plans for Earth. For a good chunk of the game it’s not clear who they are or what they want. They’re just a bunch of flying weirdos that throw a wrench in Aloy’s heroic plans until a grand reveal cracks the game wide open.

It turns out that the Zeniths were Earth’s wealthiest tech elites prior to the planet falling to ruin. When things went south they piled into a rocket and fled to safety while the rest of the human race died off. After floating around in space while humanity rebuilds itself they return to Earth with the intention of making it their own. To do that they plan to wipe the planet out and start again with a blank canvas.

There’s a lot to unpack there.

Bezos in space

The Zenith story dovetails with some current events in our real world. Whether or not it’s intentional it reads like a commentary on the big-tech space race that’s seen controversial figures like Elon Musk reaching for the stars. One of the spacemen even bares a resemblance to Jeff Bezos who successfully launched into space last summer.

Bezos’ foray into space tourism drew major criticism at the time with some questioning why the tech mogul was so keen to invest in other planets instead of using his wealth to fix our own.

“Poverty? Hunger? Homelessness? Disease? Paying your workers a fair wage or at least giving them a bathroom break? Paying taxes?” Esquire writes in an opinion piece from the time. “None of these seemed to occur to an American oligarch. Instead he’s been selling $1 billion in Amazon stock per year and pumping it into Blue Origin.”

Horizon Forbidden West shares those frustrations lambasting its fictional billionaires for using their wealth to escape Earth instead of helping it. That’s a stark contrast to Aloy who is committed to aiding every person she comes across (well except the “bad guys” she routinely cuts down) and rebuilding the world.

The game draws a parallel between the modern obsession with space colonization and America’s dark history with the concept. There’s no ambiguity about a story where a ship full of strangers land in the U.S. and plot to wipe out its indigenous people so they can settle there. Horizon Forbidden West’s story doesn’t trust that figures like Jeff Bezos are responsible enough to lead a space colonization effort any better.

Perhaps Guerilla Games is trying to correct its own past by talking about colonization. When Horizon Zero Dawn launched it was criticized for using loaded words like “savages” to describe some of its tribes. The series is certainly guilty of using historically oppressive language while appropriating imagery from various cultures. The sequel raises the same concerns (it’s still a game about indigenous tribes starring a white hero) though it feels more willing to engage with the real struggles indigenous people face.

Horizon Forbidden West isn’t subtle about its politics (it features a creepy antagonist named “Ceo”) and that’s for the best. While studios like Ubisoft have tried to affirm its games don’t have a political stance Guerilla Games goes for the jugular here. In an era where big-tech celebrities are funneling infinite reserves of cash into vanity projects Horizon Forbidden West shows us just how dangerous that can get when we stop paying attention.

Horizon Forbidden West is available now on PS4 and PS5.

Allegedly. Right now West's attorneys are pushing the idea that there's no proof that West wrote the posts on Instagram or Twitter in legal docs obtained by TMZ claiming that saying they were written by West is hearsay and inadmissible in court.

“Kim claims she read something online allegedly by Kanye and characterizes the posts in her declaration as misinformation” the documents state. “Kim needed to offer the social media posts into evidence and show that the posts were written by Kanye.”

The argument might not hold water. West posted actual texts between himself and Kardashian which she surely has a record of sending on her own phone. He has also himself confessed at certain points that his posts crossed the line—which certainly insinuates he wrote them.

“I know sharing screen shots was jarring and came off as harassing Kim” he wrote in a since deleted post. “I take accountability. I’m still learning in real time. I don’t have all the answers. To be good leader is to be a good listener.”

West also said he'd step back from writing posts in all-caps as it makes people “feel like I’m screaming at them.”

Kardashian filed last year to be “officially single” while the rest of her assets are properly divided between herself and her ex. On Thursday Page Six shared a statement from the beauty mogul they found in legal documents about the online harassment in which she asks a judge to sign off on her divorce papers.

“I very much desire to be divorced” Kardashian wrote saying West's behavior has become a privacy issue for her entire family. “Kanye has been putting a lot of misinformation regarding our private matters and co-parenting on social media which has created emotional distress.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphcGFudGltZXMuY28uanAvb3Bpbmlvbi8yMDIyLzAyLzI3L2NvbW1lbnRhcnkvd29ybGQtY29tbWVudGFyeS93ZXN0cy1jeWJlci1ydXNzaWEtYXBwZWFzZW1lbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The West's cyberattack appeasement helped give Putin a green light,"There were many reasons Russian President Vladimir Putin finally decided to invade Ukraine but one was the failure of an international alignment on the consequences of such aggression.

Tacit indifference to Russia’s behavior from both sides of the Atlantic — regarding previous invasions of Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014 nerve-agent attacks on political opponents support for a bloody war criminal in Syria — undoubtedly encouraged the Kremlin's provocations.

But it’s not just indifference to Russia’s recent kinetic aggression that’s to blame. Insufficient response to its nonkinetic military operations helped equip the Kremlin with an effective virtual complement to the traditional invasion. The West in effect conducted a policy of digital appeasement in response to multiple cyberattacks. How did we get here and what can we do going ahead?"

“The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus character — that is the goal of true education.” — Martin Luther King Jr.

As Black History Month comes to a close I am elated to celebrate just a few of the current Black leaders here in Bay County. This county has seen its share of African American groundbreakers in the past and today is no different. Presently we have three Black city officials holding offices of distinction. I have the honor and privilege to highlight them today.

Odgers swim is not only the fastest swim she’s put up at any conference meet it’s also a new lifetime best and her first time under 2:07.

Eastin who also raced at Stanford holds the American NCAA Pac-12 and Pac-12 meet record at a 1:41.51. Smith’s time here would have been fast enough to win the NCAA title last year which went to Michigan’s Olivia Carter (1:51.33).

Taylor Ruck started for Stanford with a 47.13 slightly trailing her PB in the individual 100 free of 46.76.

To top things off on Tuesday the wild doyenne of daytime TV lost the show that bears her name.

It was announced that “The Wendy Williams Show” is ending after its 13th season — a season in which Williams never even made it on air due to her health woes.

Williams 57 is currently in Florida with her son Kevin Hunter Jr. 21 and those who know her are concerned.

“Wendy is missing her medical appointments down in Florida” claimed a longtime friend. “People are very worried about Wendy and her wellbeing … We want to get Wendy back to New York City to get her back on track.”

Williams who according to Forbes was on a contract of $15 million a year is believed to have hired attorney LaShawn Thomas in her fight against Wells Fargo. The bank has frozen her assets and claimed that she is an “incapacitated person” who needs a guardianship.

In court documents signed in Williams’ name the former host strenuously denied the allegations and earlier this month filed an affidavit in New York Supreme Court for a temporary restraining order against Wells Fargo. She insisted that a financial adviser Lori Schiller who alleged that the star was of “unsound mind” is a “disgruntled” former employee. Thomas and Wells Fargo both declined to comment.

“A lot of people are concerned about Wendy right now but it seems like things are getting worse” a show insider told The Post citing how Sherri Shepard went from being Williams’ permanent guest host to taking her time slot. “Wendy is pissed right now. You have to understand her talk show was pretty much all she had. It was her passion so now what?”

Sources told The Post there are two camps battling for the right to help Williams. In one corner is her longtime publicist Howard Bragman and manager Bernie Young along with her longtime New York doctors and attorneys.

In the other corner is Thomas and Williams’ purported new publicist Shawn Zanotti — both of whom have worked with Williams’ ex-husband Hunter.

After Bragman put out a statement on Williams’ behalf in the week a reply popped up on her Instagram account presented as if it was from Wendy herself: “Mr. Bragman although I appreciate your concerns and respect you immensely I have not authorized you to make any statements on my behalf.”

Bragman told People magazine that he was not sure if Williams had penned the message herself.

7 Fans were fearful after she passed out on air during a 2017 Halloween show. She later suggested it was because of menopause.

“The statement that was put out by the guy Howard was not in the best interest of Wendy. You wouldn’t refer to your client’s show as the ‘Maybe Wendy Show’ which was shade directed towards Wendy” Zanotti told The Post. “To further go on to question the validity of her verified IG page is even more proof that this was not in the best interest of Wendy — knowing he hasn’t spoken to her.”

She continued “He is attempting to insert himself into the conversation for his own recognition. I never release her statement without Wendy approving it first. I am giving you my personal opinion right now — her focus at this time is on her health and the case … The focus right now should not be on the public shaming of Wendy Williams or the production company making a decision from ‘a business point of view’ it should be on uplifting her while she is going through a very human experience.

“So please send prayers and positivity to Wendy and her legal team who have bigger fish to fry!”

Williams last hosted her daytime talk show in July 2021 and was due to return in October. However a series of guest hosts were brought in while she worked with “holistic health professionals to help her reach optimal health during her treatment of Graves’ disease and thyroid concerns” Zanotti has said.

Williams first sparked fears for her health in 2017 when she passed out on air while dressed as the Statue of Liberty for a Halloween episode. Williams blamed it on menopause: “I’m a 53-year-old middle-aged woman going through what middle-aged women go through if you know what I mean…The costume got hot. All the sudden right before passing out I felt like I was in the middle of a campfire.

“No I wasn’t stroking out” she insisted. “Nope I’m here for a long time.”

A former senior staffer at “The Wendy Williams Show” told The Post how producers were left panicking when Williams slurred on air in 2018. The host later took to social media to apologize saying the slurring could be attributed to pain medication she was taking for a fractured shoulder that “hurt like hell” as well as Graves’ disease. The condition which results in an overproduction of thyroid hormones can cause tremors heat sensitivity and anxiety.

Then in 2019 Williams — who has previously admitted that she began abusing cocaine while working in radio beginning in the 1980s — revealed that she was living in a sober house as she battled addiction. That same year she filed for divorce from her husband of 20 years after it was revealed that Hunter had fathered a baby girl with his alleged mistress Sharina Hudson.

Hunter left the show where he was executive producer. But a former senior staffer at “The Wendy Williams Show” told The Post that in fact it was Hunter who had kept a close eye over Williams — for better or worse.

“Kevin handled it all. A lot of people would probably agree that Wendy is not very good with details but … it’s just her nature as for all these years Kevin handled all the details so she didn’t have to” the staffer who worked closely with Williams said.

“I’m not her doctor but anybody working around her knows that she’s very capable and she personally signs checks. She has a business and she has to pay bills and meet payroll” the staffer added.

The staffer said that Hunter was Williams’ de-facto gatekeeper adding: “I remember not having full access to Wendy when Kevin was around. She had her hair and makeup and wardrobe in her office and the door was always closed and it was restricted to who could get to her.”

Another source who knows Hunter and Williams described him as a “tyrant who ruled by fear who often kept important information from Wendy herself. He would overrule big bookings out of petty jealousy and never tell Wendy about it. Many people celebrated the day he left the set.”

But the staffer said Hunter could also be seen as having protected the host.

“Maybe Kevin was not exactly the bad guy. He kept things in order. He kept away the so called friends and hangers-on” the staffer said. “With him gone people were able to get close to her who should not have.”

The staffer alleges that once while Williams was living in the sober house in Queens the host ordered an Uber and went home to Livingston NJ. She was missing for about an hour before anyone realized where she was the staffer said.

“Wendy went to a liquor store on the way and she was apparently totally drunk when Kevin found her” the staffer claimed. “It makes sense as this was a tough time for her.”

As Page Six reported at the time a drunken Williams was found after leaving the sober house — and hours after Hudson had given birth — and taken to a hospital.

A lot of Williams’ anguish goes back to her marriage split those who know her said.

In January she told SiriusXM’s “The Jess Cagle Show” that her ex Hunter was a “serial” cheater and claimed she knew about his affairs “almost since the beginning” of their relationship.

“The more successful I got and he got and we believed in each other the more of a jerk he became — he used his good credit to purchase property that he chose to wine and dine his extramarital affairs … This girl wasn’t the only one” she said of Hudson who gave birth to daughter Journey in 2019. “She just happens to be the one who kept his baby.”

Hunter has not publicly acknowledged engaging in affairs or fathering a child outside of wedlock but broke his silence in a statement after Williams’ divorce filing admitting he was “not proud” of his actions. “I am going through a time of self-reflection and am trying to right some wrongs” he said at the time adding that he would continue to “fully support” Williams.

The staffer claimed that during the end of their marriage Williams would leave the television studio and go home to clean while Hunter was away with his mistress.

“She was alone a lot of the time” said the staffer. “After she had fractured her shoulder [in 2018] and the show where she was slurring her words she was on medication she was drinking. It was easy for her to drink to deal with the pain of knowing that her husband was with another woman.”

Williams finally had to pay Hunter to leave their production company. Asked whether Williams will get her full year’s salary even though she did not appear on show a rep declined to comment.

Announcing Williams’ departure Mort Marcus and Ira Bernstein the co-presidents of the Debmar-Mercury syndication company said they had great love for her. “Since Wendy is still not available to host the show as she continues on her road to recovery we believe it is best for our fans stations and advertising partners to start making this transition now” they said in a statement. “We hope to be able to work with Wendy again in the future and continue to wish her a speedy and full recovery.”

The staffer said that Williams also suffers from lymphedema which affects the circulation in her ankles and causes a build-up of fluid and may explain why the host was seen being pushed in a wheelchair last November.

“I don’t know how Wendy will handle not having the show. It’s so sad” the staffer added. “The frustrating thing is that Wendy has successfully transferred mediums from iconic radio host to TV — not even Howard Stern has done that. Wendy changed daytime TV … she’s going to leave a big hole.

“I think a lot of people would agree that Wendy could go off for a year … and if she gets another show that would be her greatest comeback.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXZ5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3Mvbm9yZm9say92aXJnaW5pYS1uYXR1cmFsLWdhcy1hd2FyZHMtMTAwMDAwLXRvLXBoYXJyZWxsLXdpbGxpYW1zLXllbGxvd2hhYi1zY2hvb2wtaW4tbm9yZm9say_SAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2F2eS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL25vcmZvbGsvdmlyZ2luaWEtbmF0dXJhbC1nYXMtYXdhcmRzLTEwMDAwMC10by1waGFycmVsbC13aWxsaWFtcy15ZWxsb3doYWItc2Nob29sLWluLW5vcmZvbGsvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Virginia Natural Gas awards $100000 to Pharrell Williams’ YELLOWHAB School in Norfolk,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wavy.com/news/local-news/norfolk/virginia-natural-gas-awards-100000-to-pharrell-williams-yellowhab-school-in-norfolk/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXZ5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3Mvbm9yZm9say92aXJnaW5pYS1uYXR1cmFsLWdhcy1hd2FyZHMtMTAwMDAwLXRvLXBoYXJyZWxsLXdpbGxpYW1zLXllbGxvd2hhYi1zY2hvb2wtaW4tbm9yZm9say_SAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2F2eS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL25vcmZvbGsvdmlyZ2luaWEtbmF0dXJhbC1nYXMtYXdhcmRzLTEwMDAwMC10by1waGFycmVsbC13aWxsaWFtcy15ZWxsb3doYWItc2Nob29sLWluLW5vcmZvbGsvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpcmdpbmlhYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvaGVhdnktaGl0dGVycy0zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Heavy hitters,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/heavy-hitters-3/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpcmdpbmlhYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvaGVhdnktaGl0dGVycy0zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNmY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS9iYXlhcmVhL2FydGljbGUvSG93LW9uZS1TaWxpY29uLVZhbGxleS1zdGFydHVwLXJ1bnMtb24tdGhlLWxhYm9yLTE2OTQ1NTE2LnBocNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,They weren't paid.

Demond Cook transformed his finances shifting from corporate security at the National Basketball Association (NBA) to cybersecurity.

Finding his footing took time and Demond Cook relied on self-study networking and trial and error before securing his first green light.

While venturing into the field Cook recognized a striking disconnect between hiring managers and recruiters in the cybersecurity space. This led to the creation of Cook Consulting Group (CCG) in June of 2020 to address the knowledge gaps. Now Demond Cook operates as a beacon of hope for others opening the doors for more minorities looking to venture into the field.

“I noticed the disconnect between hiring managers and recruiters in cyber security” Cook told AfroTech. “Most recruiters have no idea what cyber security professionals do for a living so I started CCG to bridge the gap. This would also put me in a position of influence to help more people of color break into the field of cybersecurity.”



He continued: “I also wanted to use my skills to help companies the same way I have consulted for other Fortune 500 companies in my career. I figured if I was qualified enough to do consulting in cybersecurity for them why not do it for my own company?”"

The Massachusetts Gaming Commission recently announced that it had collected more than $3.7 million in 2021 as part of the state’s “jackpot intercept” program.

Under the program created by state legislation Massachusetts’ three gaming licensees partnering with the commission’s Investigations and Enforcement Bureau check a database to determine if a jackpot winner owes back taxes to the state or child support to a former spouse.

Whenever someone wins a jackpot of more than $1200 in slots or a table jackpot of $5000 or that pays out at 300-to-1 odds that person’s name and Social Security number has to be run through the Department of Revenue to see if they owe any back taxes or back child support.

Nineteen other states have similar programs. Nevada isn’t one of them.

No Nevada law just yet

Nevada hasn’t approved such a law yet but it’s not for lack of trying. State lawmakers tried to develop one with legislation debated in March 2021.

Proponents of Assembly Bill 406 passed a section of the bill supporting the concept of intercepting jackpots to pay delinquent child support but the details of how that would be done were left for consideration in the next legislative session in 2023.

Last year’s bill testimony indicated the technology of the system could be ready this year and that details of implementation could be debated when the Legislature convenes next January.

“The Nevada Child Support Enforcement Program has over 83500 open child support cases” said Cathy Kaplan chief of the Child Support Enforcement Program for the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services Department of Health and Human Services.

“Of those cases there are over 68000 obligors who are in arrears with their child support obligations” she said. “Existing statute allows past-due support to be withheld when an obligor wins a prize or lottery. However there are no current processes for licensed gaming establishments to identify delinquent obligors and withhold from their gambling winnings.”

Karen Cliffe chief deputy district attorney of the Family Support Division of the Clark County district attorney’s office cited Colorado casinos’ experience as a positive outcome of the institution of such legislation.

“For five years Colorado casinos fought off the legislation” Cliffe said.“They made their first collection the day it was implemented. That same year they collected $500000. To date well over $4 million has been collected.”

She noted that the executive director of the Colorado Gaming Association initially opposed legislation for fear that the child support review conducted before payout would be troublesome. “However their experience has been the opposite” she said. “It has been a very smooth transition.”

Cliffe said the Nevada bill reviewed by the Assembly Judiciary Committee last year had two sections: one requiring the state’s Department of Health and Human Services to establish and maintain a secure registry for the purpose of withholding gaming winnings and the other amending Nevada Revised Statutes to include gaming winnings as funds that may be withheld for the support of a child.

Under the bill “gaming winnings” are defined as winnings at a licensed gaming establishment that are required to be reported to the IRS on form W-2G.

‘Significant undertaking’

But others say the size and complexity of Nevada’s gaming industry makes such a law more difficult to implement.

The Nevada Resort Association representing 77 casino companies statewide recognized the benefit of a child support jackpot intercept system but disagreed with the execution of the bill.

“Our concerns with AB406 as initially drafted were centered on details and logistics rather than the concept” NRA President and CEO Virginia Valentine said. “Due to the size and complexity of Nevada’s gaming industry as compared to states with far fewer licensees a reasonable first step would be for the state to develop a reliable and secure IT system or database and ensure it works as intended with adequate data privacy protections before mandating an untested system.”

Valentine said that after the system becomes operational she recommends a pilot program to address any issues such as appropriate controls and employee training including who has access to the sensitive information and the impacts to licensees in terms of staffing and operations.

“This is a significant undertaking that must be done properly from the beginning” she said.

Former Nevada Gaming Control Board Chairwoman Becky Harris now a distinguished fellow in gaming and leadership at UNLV’s International Gaming Institute said she is neither for nor against the Nevada legislation but she pointed out some of the issues that lawmakers will face.

“We haven’t done a study to see who’s actually winning our jackpots” said Harris who also served two legislative sessions as a state senator. “We are an international destination. That’s not to say that in Massachusetts they don’t have international visitation but you can’t even compare Massachusetts to Nevada because they have three licensees and when you look across restricted and non-restricted (licenses in Nevada) we’re at almost 3000.”

Harris also questioned whether casino properties would have to track child-support obligors from other states and which casinos would have to withhold jackpots in the case of progressive slot wins.

“It’s a whole different conversation when the question becomes who is going to be subject to this because we have progressive jackpots that go across properties” she said. “Who is going to be responsible for making sure there’s compliance? Is it the property where the jackpot hit or is it the responsibility of all the properties that contributed to the jackpot? I’m sure they can figure it out but it seems to me that any legislation that deals with this is going to have to exempt international travelers and we’re probably going to have to exempt people from out of state because I don’t know how you require Nevada licensees to comply with knowing what all the child-support laws guidelines and arrears are in 50 states let alone all over the world.”

Another question: If jackpot intercepts are in place could that produce a chilling effect on the local population’s willingness to play?

“I think it becomes a challenge because we do have a responsibility to make sure that the games are fair and part of the fairness of those games is that when you win you get paid” Harris said.

Intercepting jackpots

Last year Encore Boston Harbor operated by Las Vegas-based Wynn Resorts Ltd. intercepted $2.2 million Penn National Gaming's Plainridge Park Casino captured $921595 and MGM Resorts International's MGM Springfield diverted $633937 as part of Massachusetts' jackpot interception program.

Bruce Band deputy director of the Investigations and Enforcement Bureau said 2021 was a record year for intercepting back tax and child support funds.

Are gamblers surprised when they find out they're not going to collect the amount they thought they'd won?

""I think some of them are some to the extent that they try to switch the jackpot to somebody else"" Band said.

That’s according to WWE chairman Vince McMahon who found himself in a heated interview with Costas. McMahon is also the co-founder of the XFL a spring football league that failed miserably in its first season.

Costas interviewed McMahon on HBO about the downfall of the league and things got testy. In a new book authored by Jim Miller McMahon said if Costas was a little bigger he “would deserve to get the s*** beat out of him.”

During an interview with Graham Bensinger this week Costas addressed the comment and a whole lot more.

The XFL got off to a pretty good start in its first year in 2001 under the leadership of McMahon and Dick Ebersol. As the season wore on the ratings dropped dramatically. The significant drop was a key point in Costas’ interview with McMahon.

In Miller’s book “Tinderbox: HBO’s Ruthless Pursuit of New Frontiers” McMahon explained why he grew agitated with Costas as the interview progressed.

“Once we were doing the interview he kept interrupting me and interrupting me and bringing up topics that had nothing to do with what we were supposed to be talking about” McMahon said. “He kept trying to do the ‘I gotcha’ kind of thing. It was clear he didn’t want to hear any of my answers.”

Then McMahon got personal with the height jabs.

“The other problem was that Bob is so freaking pompous” McMahon said in the book. ‘The entire time he acted like he was above me and was just using me to show how great he was. I was sitting there really pissed off and started thinking I wish he wasn’t 5-feet high and 140 pounds. If he was 6-5 and 295 he would deserve to get the s*** beat out of him. I could have really given them some great television.”

Bob Costas recently gave his side of the interview with Vince McMahon

Costas said he wanted to speak with McMahon about the declining ratings and various other topics but McMahon got angry.

“The XFL was in its first and last year” Costas told Graham Bensinger. “It was getting literally the lowest ratings in the history of prime-time television for any programming. It was crap. No disrespect to any of the players or coaches.

“The interview became very heated perhaps because he wasn’t expecting to be challenged although I told him in the green room beforehand that there were going to be some tough questions. He came forward and starts jabbing his finger. So now we’re like nose to nose. I wasn’t so much as smiling as smirking and I think that set him off all the more.

“He was very angry. It’s HBO. It’s live. There’s no commercials. It’s like 27-28 minutes most of which is unremitting tension. He gets up to leave. I shake his hand. He walks out and I can hear the door slam. Wouldn’t you know it the next guest is Bob Knight.”

Knight the former Indiana basketball coach known for his temper tantrums was promptly greeted by Costas.

“I remember sitting down and saying ‘Coach this is the one time in your life when your presence will lower the temperature in the room'” he said.

Costas said the day after the interview McMahon called him. He wanted to do another one.

“The next morning my phone rings” Costas told Bensinger. “‘Bob Vince let’s make it two out of three falls. I want a rematch.’ I said great. We did do the second about a year later. It was very good but much less heated on HBO but we never had the third one.”

Costas then responded to McMahon wanting to beat him up but wouldn’t because of the size difference between the two.

“The only thing about this — it isn’t even annoying it’s amusing — Vince continues to say — he said it in a documentary on the XFL and he said it in a book that a history of HBO — I wish that Bob was bigger because then I could’ve kicked the crap out of him” Costas said.

“Now let’s consider this premise. The premise then is if I don’t like your questioning but as long as we’re in the same weight class it’s OK if I just try to kick the s*** out of you. What sense does that make? It’s ridiculous on its face. It’s dopey but what the hell. Who cares?

“I don’t dislike Vince. If Vince walked in here right now we’d have a laugh. We’d probably go have a drink — and then he’d kick the s*** out of me.”",,,,,,,,,

PAUL — Warroad girls hockey forward Talya Hendrickson said the Warriors were a little down after a sluggish first period but knew better than to get too far down.

The state’s top-ranked Class A team was bound to erupt sooner or later and the Warriors sure did.

Madison Lavergne and Kate Johnson scored two goals apiece as Warroad scored six unanswered goals en route to a 6-1 victory over Proctor/Hermantown in the Class A girls hockey championship Saturday at Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul denying the Mirage back-to-back titles.

“The floodgates just opened up” Hendrickson said. “You get one and it’s just bam-bam-bam. Usually we just build off that momentum and keep it going the rest of the game. Obviously we hoped it’d be the first but it’s not always the first (she laughed). We try our best.”

Warroad playing in its seventh straight state tournament brought a little luster back to “Hockeytown USA.” The Warriors won their first state title since capturing back-to-back championships in 2010 and 2011.

The Warriors were making their 13th state appearance and have finished as runner-up five times including in 2019.

“It’s not about me. It never has been but it’s kind of cool to win one with all my kids” said David Marvin in his 16th season as Warriors coach visibly emotional. “It’s been close. We’ve been really close and I can’t say it never affected me.”

Proctor/Hermantown meanwhile was playing in its sixth state tournament all since 2014 (seven if you count Proctor/Hermantown/Marshall’s appearance in 2010). The Mirage downed Warroad 3-1 in last year’s state semifinals en route to an undefeated season.

After graduating 10 seniors Proctor/Hermantown started the season off sluggish going 0-2 including a 1-0 loss to Warroad so it was remarkable the Mirage advanced this far.

But after a strong first period Saturday with junior Nya Sieger burying a rebound to give the Mirage a 1-0 lead a repeat was certainly looking possible.

But then something happened. The intermission.

“Obviously the momentum shifted there with that break” Proctor/Hermantown coach Emma Stauber said. “If we could have just kept playing … coming out for that second period they got that first goal and it was just a downward spiral from there. We stopped moving our feet and weren’t moving the puck. It wasn’t working.”

Stauber admitted she saw ominous signs even before Hendrickson opened “the floodgates” with a goal at 3:02 in the second.

“We were happy and excited in the locker room that we were ahead” Mirage captain Ember Kehtel said of the first intermission. “We felt we had the momentum but then it shifted.”

Lavergne scored about three minutes later and Johnson tallied two power-play goals as a game many expected to come down to the wire ended up being a foregone conclusion with Warroad leading 4-1 going into the third.

“I think the main thing was our energy it just wasn’t there” said captain Rylee Gilbertson one of four Mirage seniors. “And on the bench we just didn’t have as much positivity as we should have. We needed to respond but just couldn’t.”

Warroad showed in Friday’s semifinals what the Warriors are capable of as they scored four goals in a 2:08 span of the third period to pull away for a 5-0 victory over South St. Paul.

Kendra Nordick gave up an early goal but was solid in net with 18 saves for the top-seeded Warriors (26-3-1) while fellow senior goalie Abby Pajari capped off a stellar two-year run with 28 saves for the Mirage (21-8-1).

Both Hendrickson and Johnson finished with nearly 90 points apiece for a Warroad team that averaged nearly six goals a contest.

“Abby is a great goalie but we were getting rebounds on her she couldn’t do too much about” Johnson said.

While it was little consolation for the Mirage it was an all-north finale the first girls state title game pitting teams from the 218 area code comprising Sections 7 and 8.

At least one team from either of those sections has made the state title game five straight years. Warroad has come up on the short end of more than its share of state title games so the Warriors were going to enjoy this one.

Warroad coach David Marvin introduced Hendrickson Johnson and Nordick to open up the postgame presser.

“This is Kendra this is Kate and this is Tals and we are the state champions” Marvin said followed by a couple shouts of ""Woo-hoo!"" from the players.

PAUL — Sara Kaiser doesn’t score the most goals for the Andover girls hockey team but when the game is still in doubt late in regulation one could argue she’s the most clutch goal scorer on the Huskies’ roster.

The senior assistant captain’s 11th goal of the season in the dying minutes of the third period broke the tie that lifted Andover to its second state championship and a perfect season.

The No. 1 Huskies outlasted third-seed Minnetonka 5-4 in the Class AA championship Saturday night at the Xcel Energy Center.

“It left me speechless” Kaiser said. “I just wanted to go straight over to our fans because of all the excitement and then celebrate with my teammates. It was amazing.”

Kaiser scored with 1:40 left on the clock after Maya Engler won a race to the puck just inside the blue line of the Skippers zone. Engler poked it forward along the half boards and Kaiser swooped in to pick up the puck and wrist it past goaltender Sophia Johnson.

The call for a good goal stood after a review to make sure Kaiser was onside.

“I believed in Maya that she won the battle” said Kaiser whose last goal came Feb. 3. “I went for the puck and shot for the open net. It was just an amazing experience.

“I thought I was onside but I got nervous when they reviewed it but then I remembered I was way behind the play.”

Kaiser’s heroics came into the spotlight on a much smaller stage earlier this season when Andover met Minnetonka in the championship game of the Walser Invitational on Dec. 29. She scored the game-winner on a breakaway with 3:35 left in the third period of a 4-3 win.

Andover an emerging titan of Class AA has made the semifinals four times in five years appeared in the last three title games and won it all in 2020.

“I just love being here with team” said senior captain Ashley Grabau. “The last few years set the fire in our stomachs. After taking first and then losing last year (in the finals to Edina). We used it as motivation.”

The Huskies opened Saturday’s game on fire taking the lead 15 seconds in on an Ella Boerger wrister from the left circle and Isa Goettl – battling through a collarbone injury that caused her to leave Friday’s game – scored late in the first to put Andover up two.

But Minnetonka got on the board with an Ava Lindsay goal and took the lead with goals by Grace Sadura and Kendra Distad 25 seconds apart early in the second period.

Boerger and Lindsay traded goals and Minnetonka maintained its one-goal lead going into the third period.

Madison Brown – who had two assists – tied the game on the power play 3:03 into the third pouncing on a puck that ricocheted off a Skippers defender on a shot attempt by Engler who finished with three assists.

A flurry of penalties late in regulation provided an entertaining and suspenseful finish.

With 2:47 left sophomore defenseman Cailin Mumm was called for a two-minute body-checking penalty trying to position herself to get control of the puck but Skippers forward Lindzi Avar tumbled off Mumm and into the boards.

“It was definitely frustrating sitting in the box but I was cheering for the girls from the box” Mumm said. “I knew they could do it.”

The Minnetonka power play lasted 52 seconds before Sadura was called for a body check of her own to leave each team with four players aside. Fifteen seconds of 4-on-4 was all the Huskies needed for the puck to come free in the neutral zone slide over the blue line Engler to win the race and Kaiser to put it home.

Andover limited Minnetonka to two shots in the final minute to prevent the equalizer and Courtney Stagman finished with 31 saves for the Huskies. Johnson stopped 26 shots and Lindsay finished with four total points for the Skippers.

“It stings and you can say time heals but you never forget it” said Skippers coach Tracy Cassano. “It doesn’t leave you but it does drive you to work hard and get better to get back to this place and to never feel this way again.”
