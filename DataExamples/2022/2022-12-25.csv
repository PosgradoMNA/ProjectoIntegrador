This year I spent time with cops chemists and pillow mogul Mike Lindell among many many others.

I had three main areas of focus: The election deniers and other far-right insurgents who are trying to wrest control of the GOP; our criminal justice system in the wake of George Floyd’s murder; and 3M’s history of contaminating East Metro communities with their chemicals. It was a wild ride.

It started with a bang: My first story of 2022 was about how Hennepin County Sheriff David Hutchinson repeatedly denied to a sheriff’s deputy that he was driving his county car when he crashed it a month prior while drunk on an interstate near Alexandria. Police reports and search warrant applications showed he even claimed at one point that a cab driver was behind the wheel of his county-owned SUV when he crashed.

Hutchinson’s year got worse and now he’s gone from office.

Far right fight

To some right-wingers mainstream Minnesota Republicans aren’t swinging their right hooks hard enough and they made a lot of noise about it this year.

In March police were twice called to the Morrison County Republican convention to deal with an “unruly crowd” after right-wing activists took over the convention floor.

Not to be outdone the Clay County Republican convention in Moorhead had to be canceled after a power struggle and allegations of a coup d’etat over the rightful chair of the county party. A faction broke off and held its own convention in a farmhouse where they elected their own delegates for congressional and statewide conventions.

The GOP even went so far as to publish a lengthy list of items Republican state convention-goers were asked to leave at home including sling shots flamethrowers potato guns and “hoards of insects.”

Action 4 Liberty a far-right pressure group tried to take out fellow Republicans all over the state calling them “weak and feckless.” Some of their candidates made it through the primary but in the end even their poster boy Rep. Erik Mortensen R-Shakopee didn’t get re-elected. Mortensen spent much of his first term decrying vaccines and pulling stunts to get media attention making him a pariah among fellow Republicans.

Election fraud in the GOP

The right-wingers were hyped up and ready to tackle election fraud in 2022 but their hyper-vigilance largely ended up focused on the Republican Party which sowed chaos and suspicion right out of the chute when there were discrepancies in key data from its Feb. 1 precinct caucuses.

Some candidates for governor and secretary of state called for an audit and postponement of the party conventions as well as a “full forensic audit” (stop me if you’ve heard this one before).

A small cadre of right-wing activists traveled the state claiming the 2020 election was stolen from former President Donald Trump and other Republicans.

Among the headline acts were a former small-town Minnesota mayor and a retired Army captain from Texas.

Trump supporters and members of the national “America First” movement armed with sophisticated-seeming but debunked statistical analyses bombarded local and state election officials with questions demands for audits and even threats about unfounded election conspiracy claims.

Republican Secretary of State candidate Kim Crockett led a push to get “eyes on every ballot” by recruiting more election judges — which are essentially poll workers nominated by political parties. Motivated in part by the false impression that the 2020 election was stolen they figured an army of GOP eyes would ensure victory.

As the campaign wore on it became clear how connected Crockett was to a national right-wing network led by Cleta Mitchell the Republican lawyer who tried to help former President Donald Trump flip the Georgia election results.

Crockett who had some problems with facts was a key driver of activists that pushed county officials to stop using absentee ballot drop boxes and allow more partisan poll workers to staff elections.

They had some success: Various county officials agreed to scrap drop boxes for absentee ballots and use more partisan election judges during the midterms. Crow Wing County officials agreed to hand-count election results in twice as many precincts as state law requires.

They got a boost from conservative Christians who increasingly mix church and state.

Stallings story continues

I wrote my first story about Jaleel Stallings in 2021 but wrote many more last year.

We learned the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and FBI were investigating a Minneapolis Police Department SWAT team that fired marking rounds at civilians who were breaking curfew.

Five days after George Floyd was killed by police as police sought to regain control of the city the SWAT team drove around in an unmarked white cargo van firing rubber bullets at people.

One hit Stallings an Army veteran who fired back at the van thinking he was under attack from white supremacists who were said to be roaming the city. The police jumped out of the van and beat Stallings and his friend. Stallings claimed self-defense and was acquitted by a jury then sued the city winning a $1.5 million settlement.

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman recently said he erred in prosecuting Stallings but blamed MPD officers saying they lied to prosecutors.

Brady material

A Minnesota Department of Human Rights investigation into MPD contained numerous jarring headlines.

Among the less-publicized problems was a contention that local prosecutors weren’t turning over negative information about police officers that could be helpful to the defense despite a constitutional requirement to do so.

It’s called Brady material named after 1963 U.S. Supreme Court case Brady v. Maryland.

Police PTSD

In 2021 I wrote many stories about the wave of law enforcement officers who retired early after Floyd’s murder claiming they were disabled by post-traumatic stress disorder.

In 2022 we discovered some interesting early retirees such as an MPD officer involved in the Stallings incident who got a $190000 workers compensation settlement from the city.

We found that out of 144 Minneapolis cops who received workers’ compensation settlements in the two years after Floyd was killed 139 had misconduct complaints filed against them. And they got six-figure settlements on their way out the door with the city paying over $22.2 million total by that point.

In addition many got disability pensions citing PTSD with the state paying more than $875000 per month in disability pensions to 169 former Minneapolis police officers.

They left lucrative jobs: The exodus left MPD short-staffed (which we illustrated by spending a night shift downtown) requiring it to pay heavy overtime.

Overtime plumped up their pay to the point where by our calculation about 72% of MPD cops made six figures in 2021.

The highest paid MPD cop was Sgt. Stephen McBride who was paid nearly $376000 — more than three times his regular salary.

Due to all the departures the state police and fire retirement plan could be underfunded by an estimated $1 billion.

Ballot fraud investigation

Last spring we learned about a federal investigation into the 2020 election when we reported on a perjury case involving Minneapolis DFL Sen. Omar Fateh’s brother-in-law and campaign volunteer.

Muse Mohamud Mohamed was convicted by a federal jury of lying to a grand jury about his handling of three absentee ballots during the 2020 primary campaign.

The case led to a state Senate ethics investigation during which senators learned Fateh ran his campaign rent-free out of an adult day care center in Minneapolis. We looked into the daycare for months and as we prepared to publish our findings state regulators suspended the daycare’s license.

Feeding their future

After federal criminal charges were filed against dozens of people who allegedly participated in a $250 million scheme to exploit a federal child nutrition program we followed up with several scoops:

A former senior policy aide to Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and former chair of the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority were among those charged.

A former key aide to Bernie Sanders’ Iowa presidential campaign worked as a consultant for Feeding Our Future a nonprofit that federal prosecutors say was at the center of the massive fraud.

Minneapolis City Council Member Jamal Osman’s wife incorporated a nonprofit that reported feeding 2500 children per day through the program. Osman took his name off another nonprofit and turned it over to others who went on to allegedly bilk the feds of over $10 million. Neither Osman nor his wife has been charged with a crime.

A prominent Bloomington woman that the state had awarded as an “outstanding refugee” had a nonprofit claiming to feed 6400 children per day multiple times per day. She has not been charged with a crime.

3M’s chemical history

We published a two-part series about how 3M knew its chemicals were harmful for decades but didn’t tell the public or government regulators.

The first story centered on Amara Strande a 20-year-old woman who has battled cancerous tumors for the past five years since she was in Tartan High School where she said so many kids got cancer that students joked about not drinking from water fountains.

The second story delved into internal 3M documents which show the Minnesota company hid the dangers of its chemicals for decades.

Days later 3M announced that it will stop manufacturing a group of chemicals called PFAS by the end of 2025.

My Story of the year

My favorite story of the year was about MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell getting surrounded by the FBI in a Mankato Hardee’s drive-through and having his cell phone seized.

He spent half the interview blasting me and the Reformer. This is not unusual. I keep hoping he’ll forget who I am but sure enough he remembers every time.

Lindell did allow that the Reformer is superior to Fox News or Newsmax which hadn’t adequately reported on voting machines in his view.

“You’re way better than Fox News or Newsmax” he said. “I will say this — those two rotten rotten outlets will not even bother to call me.”

It was my favorite story because even though he loathes me he answered most of my questions before abruptly cutting me off saying he had to call another loathsome reporter.

“I got CNN to call” he said. “They’re the next one I get to call.”

Then he hung up before I could tell him how much my parents love him.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzI2LzMtcmVhc29ucy10by1idXktM20tYmVmb3JlLXRoZS1lbmQtb2YtMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Reasons to Buy 3M Before the End of 2022,"Despite broad economic headwinds things are looking up for the well-diversified company in 2023.

Editors note: This article was written before a judge ruled on Dec. 22 that 3M could not transfer liability to a unit of the company that had filed for bankruptcy protection.

To say shares of 3M (MMM 1.64%) have been a disappointment of late is a considerable understatement. The stock's been a downright lousy performer for far too long currently down more than 50% since its early 2018 peak. Nearly every facet of its operation seems to be struggling these days.

Many of its challenges however are finally easing as we move into 2023. This shift could readily prompt a long-awaited rebound for the company as well as for the stock. Here's a closer look at the three biggest things now working in 3M's favor as we prepare to turn the calendar.

The U.S. dollar is starting to lose value

Investors keeping tabs on 3M will likely remember the organization lowered its full-year revenue and earnings guidance in late October. Namely its previous expectation for 2022 sales growth between 1.5% and 3.5% was dialed back to a range of 1.5% to 2% and the company is now calling for 2022 per-share earnings of $10.10 to $10.35 versus its prior guidance of $10.30 to $10.80. Its free-cash-flow-margin rate is also apt to come in lower than initial expectations.

While there are many factors driving this contracted outlook the company made a point of pointing to the still-rising value of the U.S. dollar making it tough to sell its goods to foreign customers. The greenback's value had grown more than 20% just since the middle of the year by October -- a huge gain by currency standards -- reaching a multiyear high that month.

The thing is this isn't exactly a new problem. The U.S. Dollar Index has been rallying since 2011 proving a major recurring fiscal stumbling block for the company that whole time. That's what can happen when roughly half of your revenue is generated overseas.

But the sky-high value of the dollar is now peeling back in a big way.

Fueled by a combination of now-cooling domestic inflation and the long-overdue economic recovery for most of the rest of the world the U.S. dollar now sits 9% under its late-September peak. It also seems still be heading lower since U.S. inflation should continue to level off and most other nations should continue to build on their rekindled economic growth.

At the very least it means the greenback's long rally could be leveling off which means 3M can now get a handle on its foreign pricing and demand dynamics.

3M is mitigating current and future lawsuits

In addition to its currency-related struggle legal woes have proven a major overhang for 3M shares for a while now.

The biggest of these challenges is the class action lawsuit being levied by former users of its earplugs. More than 200000 veterans are suing the 3M subsidiary that makes them claiming its product failed to prevent the noise-related hearing loss they were supposed to prevent. The matter could cost the company billions of dollars when all is said and done.

Except now it might not.

While it's a controversial legal maneuver the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as well as the American Tort Reform Association now both publicly agree with 3M's legal argument that a declaration of bankruptcy for the subsidiary should shield the parent company from the brunt of this legal liability. The matter has yet to be settled in an appeals court but the tide appears to be turning back in 3M's favor. The class action suit's participants may end up opting for a much smaller settlement now that their initial demand is in jeopardy.

Separately but simultaneously the company announced earlier this week it would stop manufacturing fluoropolymers fluorinated fluids and PFAS-based additive products -- so-called ""forever chemicals"" that are not only potentially harmful but can remain molecularly intact for decades.

The company won't discontinue production until 2025. To the extent the court of public opinion impacts what happens inside an actual courtroom the company seems to be making an effort to evolve into a good global citizen. Consumers and corporations alike have already made clear these are the kinds of organizations they'd prefer to buy from.

The price is low and the dividend is high

Finally credit has to be given where it's due. Despite a large number of distracting and expensive challenges in recent years 3M has continued to pay its dividend. Indeed the company has not only made its dividend payment in every quarter for decades now but has raised its annual dividend payment every year for the past 64 years. That makes it a Dividend King and one of the market's very best-pedigreed dividend payers.

Its dividend history isn't the chief reason an income-minded investor might want to consider stepping into this particular stock here and now however. Even more compelling is how the stock's prolonged weakness has ratcheted up the current dividend yield to an attractive 4.8%. You can find higher-yielding cheaper stocks but you won't find higher yields without greater risk than 3M currently brings to the table. It's also priced cheaply at only 11.6 times the coming year's projected per-share profits of $10.42.

This above-average dividend/below-average valuation has implications beyond driving immediate income. Thanks to higher interest rates don't be surprised to start seeing value stocks like 3M outperforming stocks of growth companies that rely heavily on low-cost capital.

In other words 3M shares could soon be catching a major cyclical tailwind not seen in years as investors shift their style preference.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29kaG9yc2UuY29tL2hvcnNlLXJhY2luZy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yNjU2MjYvc2FudGEtYW5pdGEtcG9zdHMtcmVjb3JkLW9wZW5pbmctZGF5LWhhbmRsZS1vZi0yNi0zbdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Santa Anita Posts Record Opening Day Handle of $26.3M,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9iaXRjb2luLW1pbmluZy1wb29sLWJ0Yy1jb20tcmVwb3J0cy0zbS1jeWJlcmF0dGFja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bitcoin mining pool BTC.com reports $3M cyberattack,"Major cryptocurrency mining pool BTC.com has suffered a cyberattack resulting in a significant loss of company and customer funds.

The attack occurred on Dec. 3 with attackers stealing around $700000 in client assets and $2.3 million in the company’s assets. The mining pool’s parent firm BIT Mining Limited made the official announcement on Dec. 26.

BIT Mining and BTC.com reported the cyberattack to law enforcement authorities in Shenzhen China. The local authorities subsequently launched an investigation into the incident collecting evidence and requesting assistance from relevant agencies in China. The efforts have already helped BTC.com recover some of the assets the announcement notes.

“The Company will devote considerable efforts to recover the stolen digital assets” BIT Mining said adding that it has also deployed technology to “better block and intercept hackers.”

Despite the incident BTC.com is continuing to run its mining pool services for customers with the firm stating:

“BTC.com is currently operating its business as usual and apart from its digital asset services its client fund services are unaffected.”

BTC.com one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency mining pools provides multicurrency mining services for various digital assets including Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC). Apart from mining services BTC.com also operates a blockchain browser. Its parent company BIT Mining is a publicly traded firm listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

Indore (Madhya Pradesh): A technocrat turned diplomat working in the United Nations NRI Siddharth Rajhans believes that Indore is ready to take off on the path of development and the sky is the limit.

“Indore will zoom ahead in the days to come and I plan to write a script to capture the city’s transformation and how it has brought plethora of opportunities” Rajhans said.

And this NRI who now lives in New York should know as his expertise is in backing programmes with social agenda that contribute towards sustainability and innovation.

Strong vs weak Points of Indore

He said Indore is strategically placed and has the right balance between heritage and modernisation. As the commercial capital of MP it has the most cosmopolitan vibe in the state. Apart from this the food is excpetional and the weather pleasant. It also has a footprint in the IT space and a robust start-up culture.

There are also drawbacks. “Indore needs to work more on marketing and branding itself well. Even now people in major Tier 1 cities of India don’t know much about Indore because it is not represented at the global level. But with the Green Bond that Indore Municipal Corporation is coming up with it will become the first civic body to go public on the Bombay Stock Exchange and things will change thereafter” Rajhans said.

Indore has potential to compete with developed cities

Rajhans points out why the city has immense potential. “Today Indore has all the major IT firms that Pune and Bangalore boast of; TCS Infosys and Accenture. The Crystal IT Park has some great start-ups from InfoBeans to Impetus and even a start-up I co-founded called Specify” he said.

He say that Indore’s culture is changing and becoming similar to the tech cities. Most importantly the people love and are involved with the city and that's why it won the cleanest city tag six times in a row.

Opportunities in Indore

He said that Indore is booming as the start-up capital of India. In terms of funding Indore start-ups have collectively raised over 100 million USD in the last many years.

He is the founder-member of the Indore start-up community having co-founded invested in and mentored many start-ups in Indore.

He points out that the coaching industry is booming. The top coaching institutes of the country are there in the city and are attracting medical and engineering aspirants by droves. The city will become a national hub in this field.

Indore Commercial capital of MP

When it comes to trade commerce and industry Indore tops in the state and it has been the innovation centre for years. Bhopal might be the political centre but when it comes to attracting talent be it in the field of IT start-ups or NRIs Indore is miles ahead. Not surprisingly we are the only city with an IIM & IIT. We also have a brilliant infrastructure and the biggest mall in Asia - Phoenix Citadel now in MP and this alone explains how Indore is the hotspot of commercial activity Rajhans said.",,,,,,,,,

Review using ``Enhance Speech from Adobe'' that will finish the recorded voice professionally in one shot





Adobe has released a voice editing web service '

Adobe Podcast ' using AI and has released a demo of the Podcast editing tool ''. If you use Enhance Speech from Adobe you can easily finish the recorded voice like a professional so I actually tried using it.This Adobe Podcast is being developed in December 2021 under the name Project Shesta and is described as an 'audio tool for people with stories to tell'.And Adobe has released a demo version of 'Enhance Speech from Adobe' as a tool included in Adobe Podcasts. This Enhance Speech from Adobe is a tool for removing noise mixed in the voice and clarifying only the voice Adobe claims that 'everything sounds like it was recorded in a professional studio'.So I tried to see how clear the voice actually becomes. First accessand sign in to your Adobe account from 'Sign In' in the upper right.





When you sign in to your Adobe account a voice input field will appear on the right side of the site.







Drag and drop the audio file here OK. Audio files that can be converted must be in MP3 or WAVE format and must be 1GB or less in file size or 1 hour or less in audio length. This time I tried to read out the beginning of

Uirouri with an IC recorder. A ventilating fan was running near the place where the recording was made so there is a rumbling ambient sound.





When the audio file upload succeeds noise removal processing is automatically performed. When processing is completed a player will appear and you can listen to the processed audio on the spot. You can also download and save the processed audio at hand by clicking 'Download' under the player.







In the following movie you can listen to 'recorded voice before processing' and 'recorded voice after processing with Enhance Speech from Adobe'. The audio was recorded in stereo but after processing it is in mono. The unprocessed sound that flows in the first half of the movie contains pop noise that occurs when the breath hits the microphone and the environmental sound of goo but you can see that it is removed from the processed sound that flows in the second half of the movie.

But research is beginning to reveal the mediating potential for maintaining “hopeful” states of thinking related to everything from cancer to trauma. Feldman and Corn (2022) state the following from their investigations on cancer patients and hopeful thinking:

Growing evidence demonstrates that hope is associated with a number of psychological variables in individuals with cancer including depression distress coping symptom burden and post traumatic growth and the emerging evidence suggests that hope may actually predict the probability of survival in advanced stages of cancer.

In my life I must add anecdotally that I have also witnessed cases where individuals suffering from similar issues whose primary living disposition remained “hopeful” were able to actively challenge the progression of their illness improve their own immune systems’ responsivity and even move into active remission. These individuals had some common denominators such as goal-setting focusing on the here and now avoiding catastrophizing appreciation of clear diagnostic communication from their doctors utilizing social anchors around them (family friends and church) and regulating their physical world through sleep healthy eating and daily meaning-making. To this end from the frame of research conducted by Satici et al. (2022) their results revealed that ""hope"" is directly correlated to psychological health and that hopeful individuals had higher levels of psychological well-being. But this however is only the beginning.

Champions of hope

Recently I had the chance to interview Dr. Chan Hellman a professor from the University of Oklahoma and founding Director of the Hope Research Center. He has been featured as part of TedX and has a current book on the subject of hope called Hope Rising: How the Science of HOPE Can Change Your Life. Below is an excerpt from that interview.

How would you define hopelessness Dr. Hellman?

Dr. Chan Hellman: “I believe it is more closely aligned with apathy from the perspective of ""giving up.""

What does the diametric of ""hope"" look like when compared to hopelessness?

Dr. Chan Hellman: Hope is more than wishing and is really centered on the belief that tomorrow will be better than today and that we will have a role to play in that future pursuit. It’s a cognitive process a mindset that is more than a feeling or emotion.

How do you see hopelessness play out in someone's life?

Dr. Chan Hellman: An interesting aspect of this research is what we have seen take place when people are exposed to adversity and stress and that is that they are more likely to set avoidant type goals or goals of outcomes that simply reinforce their current state which may sound counterintuitive to getting better but is really part of the insidious nature of living in hopelessness. However once we are able to nurture and restore hope this changes and we may begin to see a transition to more of an ""achievement"" mindset in those same people.

I’m wondering if there is a useful metaphor from your work on hope that might resonate with others?

Dr. Chan Hellman: I’ve developed a set of what I call ""guiding principles"" around hope and I think a few of those might address this particular question well. One is the idea that ""imagination"" is the instrument of hope. This is the ability to ""imagine the future"" which I borrowed from the work in self-psychology literature and how we might begin to see how this also affects intentionality and motivation. Another one is the idea that “hope begets hope.” This is the idea that once we experience a bit of success toward our goals it also enhances our willpower and inherent pathways to thinking. And then finally the last one is that hope is a ""social gift"" because hope tends to flourish in relationship with others and the connections we maintain rather than occurring in isolation.

Do you think that hope is an ""innate"" potential we possess?

Dr. Chan Hellman: I believe that hope is something that can actually be taught and additionally it is also malleable as research supports these ideas. In our publications around trauma and adversity where things like insecure attachments shame rumination and anxiety flourish we also see the capacity of such issues to diminish hope in people. And as it turns out therapy has gotten really good at helping us to navigate through those tough spaces and restore hope.

What are some ways that a person can start to tap into hope?

Dr. Chan Hellman: We should first recognize that setting goals is the cornerstone of hope most especially focusing on short-term specific goals and actually thinking of very specific domains where we might implement such goals. We can ask questions to help realize those domains such as: What might be a small goal I could set with my family this week? What would be a goal I could set in my work? What would be a goal I would set for my leisure time? What would be a goal I could set for my health? What we found is that short-term specific goals are a stronger promoter of hope over time than longer-term envisioned goals.

Then once we establish a short-term goal I think it’s important to take a moment and simply ""imagine"" what success is going to look like within that specific goal we have set. We might actively imagine that specific picture of goal attainment and who exactly is going to benefit from it and who is going to be there to maybe celebrate it with us.

Around goals we should also consider the strategies or ""pathways"" that we will use to attain each of those small short-term goals. For instance if my goal is to get healthy I might sit down and look at the pathway to that goal which might include first joining a gym maybe adding a trainer or simply starting to run or exercise maybe modifying my diet. I think listing these elements is important as well as understanding that every aspect will have pros and cons attached and figuring out which is the most viable pathway for yourself.

And then finally really leaning into the idea that hope is a ""social gift."" This might mean identifying somebody you can connect with someone who has a shared experience or interest you can talk to and maybe even pursuing the goal together.

These are simple ""pathways"" that connect one success to the next. Each step that is taken and achieved always helps bring the bigger goal into focus.

Hope is not an ethereal notion but rather a transformative agent and a functional way of thinking that can have great prospects for our life. And as Dr. Hellman teaches hope begins with one small step.

Two years ago consumers were not as well versed on the delicate inner workings of inventories raw consumer costs or shipping as they are today. The unwavering news of supply chain disruptions and bottlenecks including the time everyone collectively rooted for a container ship stuck in the Suez Canal readily educated consumers on just how intertwined the supply chain is with everyday life.

It was a shock to some consumers when earlier this year large retailers announced oversupply issues. Though consumers rejoiced in the news that some of their favorite stores would soon be rolling out sales those who work directly with the supply chain and the economy could recognize the considerable loss those companies were experiencing.

Retailers and manufacturers over-ordered and over-produced because they were not monitoring the economic indicators that showed supply chain constraints and labor shortages were easing.

The oversupply issue was largely caused by a lack of real-time data in planning and forecasting processes leading business leaders to make a costly overcorrection.

In a recent Accenture report 99% of the 450 CFOs surveyed reported that they need real-time data to make better decisions but only 16% of those surveyed said they have real-time data available today.

With current economic uncertainty riddling consumer sentiment an ongoing negative geopolitical climate and a continuing health crisis business professionals are asking themselves what can we do in response to current economic conditions to navigate upcoming volatility?

Create contingency plan

One of the most important things supply chain professionals can do to support planning and forecasting is to monitor external economic indicators that can directly affect their business performance. There are a multitude of indicators such as gas and oil prices weather raw material costs and industrial production that can drastically change when how and where product meets the consumer.

Due to the years of uncertainty and disruption customer-centric management is an emerging trend in supply chain planning and forecasting. This means many organizations are looking more at their customer data and overall consumer trends to make strategic business decisions. But with the lowest consumer sentiment in decades it can be difficult for companies to know how consumer spending is going to change over the next few months especially when the upcoming holiday season is taken into account.

This is where contingency planning comes into play. Now more than ever supply chain professionals need to monitor external economic data including consumer sentiment and spending to better understand what possible economic scenarios could play out. With real-time data on hand business leaders can use the projections to create best and worst possible outcomes and then plan and forecast within that range to help ensure business success.

Right now business leaders are filled with “what-if'' questions. What if consumer spending follows consumer sentiment? What if oil and gas prices rise again? What if we have to lay people off to afford wages for our employees? By monitoring the specific economic indicators that affect their business leaders can use the data to create agile contingency plans that allow for real-time updates based on how the economy changes.

Monitoring the data for proactive planning

Staying up to date on real-time economic data can be a heavy lift without the right technology. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning make it easy for business leaders to not only track economic indicators but also quantify impact and seize opportunities based on market change.

Not only can business leaders use this technology to navigate economic slowdown and volatility like we are currently experiencing but during a stable market leaders can get ahead of competitors by making constant improvements to their forecast and can drive overall better decision making and improve risk management.

AI and machine learning help business leaders become proactive decision makers instead of reactive. Even when unprecedented events come along and immediately change the economic outlook say a global pandemic for example business leaders that utilize external economic data can recover quickly and use their planning and forecasting technology to navigate the uncertainty until the time comes when they’re able to be proactive again.

Market volatility and economic uncertainty are guaranteed. As the economy ebbs and flows through various consumer trends and new business models so too will interest rates disposable income industrial production and more. By utilizing external economic data as indicators for planning and forecasting business leaders can navigate market changes and make more strategic business decisions using a mix of their company’s historic internal data and real-time economic data."

You can skip our detailed analysis of the electronics industry and go straight to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Electronics.

Electronics encompasses one of the broadest ranges of products in the modern world from TVs computers music players smartphones tablets and watches among many others. It has been one of the most transformative industries in the world for the past 50 years.

How Moore’s Law Will Impact the Electronics Industry?

Currently the latest chips are made on the 5 nm fabrication process and companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Limited (NYSE:TSMC) and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. (KSE:005930.KS) have set up their timelines for 2 nm chips in 2025. However experts predict that a fundamental limit would be reached in two or three upcoming iterations.

Many believe quantum computing is the answer to Moore’s law ending. However it's an ill-informed opinion since quantum computers are limited to a very narrow range of computing problems almost all of which have no commercial potential.

Instead companies like Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) have come up with some of the most realistic solutions by moving to specialized chips intended for specific purposes.

For instance Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has introduced DGX Systems with the objective to accelerate machine learning programs at a higher efficiency than offered by general purpose computers.

The future of electronics that compute is likely to lie in specialized chips. It is reflected in the fact that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) have also moved in that direction with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) coming up with task-specific processors like Xeon an architecture designed for AI.

Similarly Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been rolling out ‘Neural Engine’ since 2017 in its iPhones to accelerate AI applications like facial recognition. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced the neural engine in its line of computers with the M1 chip architecture in 2020.

The trend suggests that the electronics industry will survive the ending of Moore’s law and adapt to the paradigm shift.

When the Chips are Down: What Semiconductor Shortage and Stagflation Mean for Electronics Industry

The outlook for the electronics industry in the wake of chip shortage is bleak. It is not expected to subside anytime soon. Pat Gelsinger the CEO of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) says shortage may last until 2024

However a more reasonable timeframe for the shortage to end is 2025 per Ondrej Burkacky from McKinsey primarily due to the complexities associated with the manufacturing infrastructure.

Story continues

The post-pandemic stagflation has also slumped the high demand in consumer electronics which had picked up pace during the pandemic as people learned worked and entertained themselves digitally at homes during lockdowns. The weak demand is expected to ease the supply-chains problems and shortage.

Companies like Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) have cut their annual-sales outlooks as reported by the WSJ.

In China the sales of both smartphones and PCs among other electronic products have dropped with the Consumer Electronics Index down by 32% as of July 2022. Globally the shipment of PCs and smartphones have fallen by 4.7% and 10% respectively.

2030 Outlook

The market for consumer electronics has been showing a long-term cooling trend and is expected to shift from growth to cycle in the near to medium term. However according to Yang Liuqing an analyst at CITIC the opportunities in Augmented and Virtual Reality hardware still represent a huge potential for growth.

According to Precedence Research the market for electronics is valued at $724.48 billion as of 2021 and is expected to reach $1.13 trillion by 2030 growing at a modest CAGR of 5.1%.

The market will experience its fastest growth in countries in the Asia-Pacific but the largest market share will still be retained by countries in North America per the report.

Japan South Korea and the US are some of the most advanced countries in electronics. Below we list the 12 most advanced countries in electronics.

Intermarche-Wanty-Gobert-Materiaux saw some new team kits arrive on Christmas Day.

The Belgian team revealed Sunday its new uniform for the 2023 season with a similar-but-different white yellow and blue pattern and sponsor-laden style.

With the WorldTour squad set to rebrand to Intermarche-Circus-Wanty for the new year the logo of online casino platform Circus moves to the center. Construction firm Wanty’s logo moves down to make space.

The Nalini-produced kits also give space for branding from new helmet and glasses partner Uvex and shoe specialist Gaerne.

“For 2023 we unreservedly reaffirm our support for Team Intermarche-Circus-Wanty which in 2022 has been an amazing revelation for us to say the least” said Nalini founder Claudio Mantovani.

“Indeed in its second WorldTour year it won an impressive 24 victories and we can’t help but feel a surge of pride for the talent and perseverance it has shown.”

The Intermarche team was one of the revelations of 2022.

Victories from riders like Biniam Girmay Jan Hirt and Alexander Kristoff along with grand tour top-10s from Hirt Louis Meintjes and Domenico Pozzovivo saw the team finish comfortably in the mid-pack of the UCI points league in what was only its second WorldTour season.

Next year will see the arrival of a swathe of young talents alongside headline names Mike Teunissen Lilian Calmejane and former world champion Rui Costa.

Key riders from the 2022 season Kristoff and Hirt both move on as the team looks to back up its successes so far.

""Across the board we have made faster progress than we estimated in advance [in 2022]. In fact you can turn it back even further. I don’t think anyone would have believed two years ago that we wouldn’t be relegated. You must know that the ‘Sword of Damocles’ was above us” team manager Aike Visbeek told Wielerflits.

“We had an exceptionally good year and I am incredibly proud of that! As a team we have really delivered a very nice performance a year that gets a special place.""

The filter named Corsi-Rosenthal boxes or cubes can be constructed from materials found at hardware stores: four MERV-13 filters duct tape a 20-inch box fan and a cardboard box.

""The findings show that an inexpensive easy-to-construct air filter can protect against illness caused not only by viruses but also by chemical pollutants"" said study lead author Joseph Braun an associate professor at Brown University in the US.

""This type of highly-accessible public health intervention can empower community groups to take steps to improve their air quality and therefore their health"" Braun said in a statement.

As part of a project boxes were assembled by students and campus community members and installed in the School of Public Health as well as other buildings on the Brown University campus.

To assess the cubes' efficacy at removing chemicals from the air Braun and his team compared a room's concentrations of semi-volatile organic compounds before and during the box's operation.

The results published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology showed that Corsi-Rosenthal boxes significantly decreased the concentrations of several PFAS and phthalates in 17 rooms during the period they were used (February to March 2022).

PFAS a type of synthetic chemical found in a range of products including cleaners textiles and wire insulation decreased by 40 to 60 per cent.

Phthalates commonly found in building materials and personal care products were reduced by 30 to 60 per cent the researchers found.

PFAS and phthalates have been linked to various health problems including asthma reduced vaccine response decreased birth weight altered brain development in children altered metabolism and some cancers said Braun.

They are also considered to be endocrine-disrupting chemicals that may mimic or interfere with the body's hormones. PFAS have been associated with reduced vaccine response in children and also may increase the severity of and susceptibility to COVID-19 in adults according to the researchers.

""The reduction of PFAS and phthalate levels is a wonderful co-benefit to the Corsi-Rosenthal boxes"" said study co-author Robin Dodson a research scientist at US-based NGO Silent Spring Institute.

""These boxes are accessible easy to make and relatively inexpensive and they're currently being used in universities and homes across the country"" he added.

The researchers said Corsi-Rosenthal box was designed to be a simple cost-effective tool to promote accessible and effective air cleaning during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The fact that the boxes are also effective at filtering out air pollutants is a fantastic discovery"" said Richard Corsi one of the inventors of the boxes from the University of California Davis.

The researchers also found that the Corsi-Rosenthal boxes increase sound levels by an average of 5 decibels during the day and 10 decibels at night which could be considered distracting in certain settings such as classrooms.

However Braun said the health benefits of the box likely outweigh the audio side effects.

""The box filters do make some noise. But you can construct them quickly for about USD 100 per unit with materials from the hardware store. They are not only highly effective but also scalable"" Braun added.",,,,,,

What You Need To Know Airbnb announced it has implemented anti-party measures to prevent certain users from renting out a house on New Year's Eve



New account users and those with negative reviews will not be allowed to book a room for New Year's Eve and New Year's holiday



In Los Angeles more than 2900 people were deterred by Airbnb's anti-party defenses from booking entire home listings on New Year's Eve 2021



The restrictions would be in effect over the New Year's Eve weekend in 11 countries

Earlier this month Airbnb announced that it would crack down on unauthorized house parties in Los Angeles Southern California and across the country over New Year’s Eve as a preventive measure to curb rowdy — and maybe violent — celebrations.

Officials from the vacation rental platform said it would restrict certain types of bookings over New Year’s Eve and New Year’s holiday weekend.

New account users and those with a negative or little history on the vacation rental platform are prohibited from renting out one-night bookings of entire homes on New Year’s Eve officials said. Only guests with positive account history are allowed to book.

Airbnb officials also tightened rules for certain guests who attempt to book two- and three-night reservations during the New Year’s weekend.

“These proactive defenses will help to promote responsible travel and help to prevent rare instances of unwelcome behavior and enable hosts guests and communities to enjoy their end of year celebrations with added reassurance” said Naba Banerjee director of Trust Product and Operations at Airbnb in a news release.

After years of complaints from homeowners and city officials Airbnb tightened its measures to prohibit open-invite parties such as those advertised on social media and chronic party houses in 2019 and furthered their defensive approach the following year with more anti-party measures.

The coronavirus pandemic and pandemic-related restrictions fueled even more complaints from neighborhoods since many people rented Airbnb homes to party instead of going to bars and clubs.

While celebrations and parties can occur in a hotel room house or elsewhere some people have specifically booked an Airbnb or a vacation rental to host them. And those parties sometimes can get hectic and lead to violence.

Airbnb has spent millions implementing preventive measures to curb excessive unauthorized parties especially during holidays such as Halloween and others.

Airbnb officials said that since rolling out the measures party incidents over the New Year’s Eve holiday have contributed to a 56% year-over-year global drop in incidents.

Officials said in Los Angeles more than 2900 people were deterred by Airbnb’s anti-party defenses from booking entire home listings on New Year’s Eve 2021.

Name: Deeda Blair

Neighborhood: Turtle Bay

Occupation: Founder of the Deeda Blair Research Initiative for Disorders of the Brain

What’s hanging above your couch?

A Kenzo Okada. He was a Japanese painter we knew. He began the paintings in Japan and then finished them here. And for me the picture is serene but still interesting and of course it has all the colors that I love.

What’s the first job you had in New York?

When we first came which was 17 years ago I met a very interesting man Joel Marcus and a woman who worked with him. He started a real estate business for biotech companies venture capital companies and built a beautiful group of buildings here on First Avenue right near the hospital called Alexandria Real Estate Equities. It had a state-of-the-art conference room and so we did summit conferences. They were very curated and we would speak to the participating scientists for an hour or so as a group. We did oncology and neuroscience and then we did one or two on philanthropy. That was the first and only New York job. I resigned about 5 months before Bill died. I still attend or listen to them.

What color are you always drawn to?

Chalky colors. Chalky blue and chalky pale lilac and black and white.

What art or artifact are you most surprised you own?

There’s a drawing in the living room by Hubert Robert and it’s one of fantasy ruins. I always loved them. I saw this at the antiques show and I got a dealer to go and sort of persuade them to charge a little less. I never thought that I’d have a Hubert Robert drawing — although there are drawings and things around there are no major pictures; I don’t want something unless it is terrifically wonderful.

Which New Yorker would you want to hang out with?

Harold Koda Samantha Boardman Andrew Solomon Anne Goldrach and Caroline Millbank…. the list goes on

What’s the last thing you made with your hands?

The dust jacket to the book (Deeda Blair: Food Flowers and Fantasy). I’m not sure that Charles [Miers the publisher of Rizzoli] loves the idea so I call it the wrapping.

Is there one thing you own multiple versions of?

Years and years ago I found a shop in Paris that had jackets with a Mandarin collar and they came in wonderful colors. I’m home a great deal working and that’s my work costume and that’s the only thing I have multiples of. I have at least 6 of them.

What New York City museum do you always go back to? (and why)

The Metropolitan. You usually go to see an exhibit. But I think you can go and see something because you’re in the mood for it. I mean how many times have I gone and looked at the Wrightsman Rooms? To wander through the Egyptian wing or to wander through the Greek and Roman rooms is the greatest pleasure.

What do you always have next to your computer?

I don’t use a real computer I use an ipad or a telephone so there’s nothing always next to it.

What is the best view of the city?

I love the view out my window which is the ruin on Roosevelt Island. They planted wonderful trees over there and they have so far left the ruin alone and I just love that.

What building or object do you want to redesign every time you see it?

I don’t have an answer for that.

What’s one thing you would change about your field?

I would like to see much more philanthropic funding going into medical research on disorders of the brain. I read something the other day and I don’t know whether it’s an accurate statistic or not that only 5 percent of philanthropic funds really goes to medical research. It seems off to me…so I would say not enough. I mean people give megabucks to the opera to the symphony all kinds of glorious cultural things. I took a long time in figuring out this research program that I am doing to find out what is missing and what is needed. I think when you can identify young people who have been through medical school have finished a residency and are going off to Stanford or Yale — they need start-up funding.

If you could live anywhere in New York City where would it be?

Well I think I would live closer to the Met.

What would you hoard if it stopped being produced?

I am a hoarder of paper: it’s letters it’s articles if an article interested me five years ago; it is still here and eventually findable.

What do you do to get out of a creative rut?

I’m never in a creative rut I’m always thinking of things I want to do.

Where was your first New York City apartment and how much was the rent?

Here on 52nd Street.

Where in the city do you go to be alone?

I used to walk so much and I can’t anymore because of my back. The bedroom with the door shut.

The worst piece of career advice you were ever given?

A very selfish person I didn’t even ask for advice from felt compelled to tell me I should not work professionally for a venture capital group and it was a venture capital group entirely devoted to healthcare. We did the first gene therapy company we did a number of firsts and I paid no attention and thank god I didn’t.

What have you given away to someone that you wish you could get back?There’s one fantastic Givenchy evening dress that went to a museum. It was special in that Hubert let me change things — he wouldn’t let everybody change things. I wore it for years and I remember one time I was in Paris and was invited to something divine that required a glamorous long dress and it was sent by DHL and not a wrinkle. It never wrinkled. It was heavenly.

What is your favorite New York City restaurant and regular order?

Well obviously that changed with Charles Masson gone [the owner of La Grenouille] so I did go to Majorelle a lot and always had Dover sole.

Descriptive phrase you want on your obit headline?

I have a hard time coming up with anything because there is no way of saying “a massive amount of curiosity.” There’s no way of saying that! So I suppose the word kind or helpful; I don’t know.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Google's latest Contacts update introduces ""Highlights.""

This new page brings more awareness to your favorite contacts and those you've recently called.

Highlights feel a bit more Material You while also showing users their most recently added contacts too.

Google's latest update to its Contacts brings a familiar page to a different app.

According to 9to5Google the latest update to Google's Contacts app has introduced users to a ""Highlights"" page. This page can be accessed by tapping ""Highlights"" at the center of the bottom bar. When landing on this page users will find a section for ""Favorites"" and an option to add people to this section if it's empty.

The favorites section shows off the people you love talking to the most with bright full photos that you've given them along with their names neatly beneath them.

Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: 9to5Google) (Image credit: 9to5Google)

Further down this page houses a ""Recents"" portion. Self-explanatory; those that you've talked to recently will appear here. This section here expands showing you the people you've recently called accompanied by the time and date of the call. Google has added an option for those looking to clear this list if it's become too overpopulated for your liking.

Users will also find another option: added recently. Tapping on while not having added any new person to your phone will simply say ""no contacts added recently."" But once this is populated users may find this to be an easier approach to calling someone new rather than having to scroll through their lengthy list of contacts.

This update may seem a little familiar but that's due to a version of this information existing in the Phone app. While the Highlights tab features recently called people and not frequently it does have a more ""Material You"" style that users will find more familiar. Through this known design language the Recents section is housed in a rounded corner box as opposed to the favorites section in the Phone app.

Also if you're interested in further customizing your favorite people with this more prominent view Contacts now benefits from Google Illustrations as pointed out by 9to5. These photos can already be accessed through other Workspace applications like Gmail. For your contacts simply tap on the one you're interested in Pencil icon (edit) > Change (photo) and choose which illustration best fits that person.

Twitter Inc has restored a feature that promotes suicide prevention hotlines and other safety resources to users looking up certain content after coming under pressure from some users and consumer safety groups over its removal.It was reported on Friday that the feature was taken down a few days ago citing two people familiar with the matter who said the removal was ordered by the social media platform's new owner Elon Musk.After publication of the story Twitter head of trust and safety Ella Irwin confirmed the removal and called it temporary.Twitter was ""fixing relevance optimizing the size of the message prompts and correcting outdated prompts"" ­Irwin said in an email. ""We know they are useful and our intent was not to have them down permanently.""About 15 hours after the initial report Musk who did not initially respond to requests for comment tweeted ""False it is still there.""In response to criticism by Twitter users he also tweeted ""Twitter doesn't prevent suicide.""The feature known as #ThereIsHelp places a banner at the top of search results for certain topics. It has listed contacts for support organizations in many countries related to mental health HIV vaccines child sexual exploitation ­COVID-19 gender-based violence natural disasters and freedom of expression.By Saturday the banner returned to searches about suicide and domestic violence in multiple countries under terms like ""shtwt"" shorthand for ""self-harm Twitter.""Whether the feature had been restored for other categories was not clear. The feature was not appearing for some search queries that Twitter has previously said triggered it such as ""#HIV.""Twitter bans users from encouraging self-harm though consumer safety groups have criticized the company for allowing posts that they say violate the policy.On Saturday tweets showing graphic imagery of people cutting their arms appeared beneath banners on searches for self-harm.The disappearance of #ThereIsHelp had led some consumer safety groups and Twitter users to express concerns about the well-being of vulnerable users of the platform.In part due to pressure from such groups internet services including Twitter Alphabet's Google and Meta's Facebook have for years tried to direct ­users to well-known resource providers for safety issues.In her email on Friday Twitter's Irwin said ""Google does really well with these in their search results and [we] are actually mirroring some of their approach with the changes we are making.""She added ""Google provides highly relevant message prompts based on search terms they are always current and are optimized appropriately for both mobile and web.""Eirliani Abdul Rahman who had been on a recently dissolved Twitter content advi-sory group said the disappearance of #ThereIsHelp was ""extremely disconcerting"" and that completely removing a feature to revamp it was unusual.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXJtb25rZXkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMTEtYmVzdC1zbWFsbC1jYXAtYWktc3RvY2tzLXRvLWludmVzdC1pbi0xMTAxODAwL9IBWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXJtb25rZXkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMTEtYmVzdC1zbWFsbC1jYXAtYWktc3RvY2tzLXRvLWludmVzdC1pbi0xMTAxODAwLz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,11 Best Small Cap AI Stocks to Invest In,"In this article we discuss the 11 best small-cap AI stocks to invest in. If you want to read about more AI stocks go directly to 5 Best Small Cap AI Stocks to Invest In.

Artificial intelligence is one of the most significant secular phenomena rapidly changing many facets of our daily lives. In the last ten years there has been a considerable increase in the number of AI start-ups and initial public offerings (IPOs) due to the expanding technological trend. According to Gartner businesses have adopted artificial intelligence at a pace of 270% over the previous several years. More than 1/3 of organizations now either employ AI or aim to do so. As a result both long-term investors and short-term traders are becoming increasingly interested in AI investments. Over the years many investors have been interested in major companies like Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Growing investment in AI technology across industries and by businesses of all sizes is expected to gain traction over the next years. The global AI market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 20.1% from $387.45 billion in 2022 to $1394.30 billion in 2029. In 2021 the size of the worldwide market was USD 328.34 billion (see 15 biggest AI companies in the world).

However due to inflation rising interest rates and other substantial headwinds throughout the preceding year many of the market’s top artificial intelligence stocks were decimated as investors turned their focus to more traditional equities. While the year has been challenging for all stock indexes the small-cap Russell 2000 Index started to buck the trend in July when it increased by 3.6%. The S&P 500 on the other hand rose by 3% suggesting that the small-cap index may ultimately start to outpace it.

Small-cap firms continue to trade for less when markets are unstable and many investors see them as suitable investment options with promising near-term returns. So now let’s look at the 11 best small-cap AI stocks to invest in.

Methodology

In order to come up with our list of the best small-cap stocks to invest in we need to identify the list of small-cap artificial intelligence stocks. For this purpose we used iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF’s (IRBO) holdings that are smaller than $10 billion in market cap. These stocks aren’t pure artificial intelligence stocks as all ETFs lump robotics and artificial intelligence in the same bucket and most of these companies operate in other sectors as well. In order to determine the best small-cap AI stocks we ranked IRBO’s small-cap holdings using Insider Monkey’s proprietary hedge fund sentiment data. So our rankings list the best small cap AI stocks to buy according to hedge funds. You should keep in mind that some of these stocks are also shorted by another group of hedge funds however this doesn’t change the fact the following 11 AI stocks are very popular among hedge funds.

While we cannot extrapolate cleanly to the number of active users because one user can do multiple downloads as versions are updated the active users should dwarf the company’s 19000 paying customers. One thing is clear – once a customer is “landed” they tend to spend more in the subsequent years. Elastic’s net revenue retention has hovered around 130% for several years.…” (Click here to read the full text)

You may recall from my Q1 letter that I initiated a position in the stock given the potential for a new CEO to leverage the company’s passionate and engaged userbase. The investment had meaningful upside potential (multiples of the then trading price) but also presented real downside risk; as such I kept our exposure to just a few percentage points of the portfolio. Fast forward six months and underlying trends like churn engagement and new users weakened dramatically. I sold our shares as the likelihood for the company to achieve financial success has become increasingly remote.”

Longleaf Partners mentioned Lumen Technologies Inc. (NYSE:LUMN) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:

“Lumen Technologies Inc. (NYSE:LUMN) – Global fiber company Lumen was the top detractor in the quarter. In September the company announced a new CEO Kate Johnson would take over for Jeff Storey. Johnson has a strong track record of delivering organic revenue growth the primary area where Lumen has struggled. Johnson held previous roles at GE and Microsoft where she most recently served as head of Microsoft US and doubled her division’s revenue in only four years. Multiple checks through our network vouch for her and suggest this leadership change is a positive upgrade that will bring the discipline and focus on sales that Lumen has been missing. The market reacted negatively with concern over the potential for another dividend cut or strategy change. We are confident the stock price reaction is highly overblown versus any impact that a potential dividend cut would have on value per share. The stock now trades at 4.5x EBITDA and we believe the best value accretive capital allocation move today is share repurchase. Shortly after quarter end Lumen closed on the sale of part of its consumer business to Apollo further improving its balance sheet and business mix.”

Twitter Inc has restored a feature that promotes suicide prevention hotlines and other safety resources to users looking up certain content after coming under pressure from some users and consumer safety groups over its removal.It was reported on Friday that the feature was taken down a few days ago citing two people familiar with the matter who said the removal was ordered by the social media platform's new owner Elon Musk.After publication of the story Twitter head of trust and safety Ella Irwin confirmed the removal and called it temporary.Twitter was ""fixing relevance optimizing the size of the message prompts and correcting outdated prompts"" ­Irwin said in an email. ""We know they are useful and our intent was not to have them down permanently.""About 15 hours after the initial report Musk who did not initially respond to requests for comment tweeted ""False it is still there.""In response to criticism by Twitter users he also tweeted ""Twitter doesn't prevent suicide.""The feature known as #ThereIsHelp places a banner at the top of search results for certain topics. It has listed contacts for support organizations in many countries related to mental health HIV vaccines child sexual exploitation ­COVID-19 gender-based violence natural disasters and freedom of expression.By Saturday the banner returned to searches about suicide and domestic violence in multiple countries under terms like ""shtwt"" shorthand for ""self-harm Twitter.""Whether the feature had been restored for other categories was not clear. The feature was not appearing for some search queries that Twitter has previously said triggered it such as ""#HIV.""Twitter bans users from encouraging self-harm though consumer safety groups have criticized the company for allowing posts that they say violate the policy.On Saturday tweets showing graphic imagery of people cutting their arms appeared beneath banners on searches for self-harm.The disappearance of #ThereIsHelp had led some consumer safety groups and Twitter users to express concerns about the well-being of vulnerable users of the platform.In part due to pressure from such groups internet services including Twitter Alphabet's Google and Meta's Facebook have for years tried to direct ­users to well-known resource providers for safety issues.In her email on Friday Twitter's Irwin said ""Google does really well with these in their search results and [we] are actually mirroring some of their approach with the changes we are making.""She added ""Google provides highly relevant message prompts based on search terms they are always current and are optimized appropriately for both mobile and web.""Eirliani Abdul Rahman who had been on a recently dissolved Twitter content advi-sory group said the disappearance of #ThereIsHelp was ""extremely disconcerting"" and that completely removing a feature to revamp it was unusual.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXJtb25rZXkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMTEtYmVzdC1zbWFsbC1jYXAtYWktc3RvY2tzLXRvLWludmVzdC1pbi0xMTAxODAwL9IBWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXJtb25rZXkuY29tL2Jsb2cvMTEtYmVzdC1zbWFsbC1jYXAtYWktc3RvY2tzLXRvLWludmVzdC1pbi0xMTAxODAwLz9hbXA9MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,11 Best Small Cap AI Stocks to Invest In,"In this article we discuss the 11 best small-cap AI stocks to invest in.

Artificial intelligence is one of the most significant secular phenomena rapidly changing many facets of our daily lives. In the last ten years there has been a considerable increase in the number of AI start-ups and initial public offerings (IPOs) due to the expanding technological trend. According to Gartner businesses have adopted artificial intelligence at a pace of 270% over the previous several years. More than 1/3 of organizations now either employ AI or aim to do so. As a result both long-term investors and short-term traders are becoming increasingly interested in AI investments. Over the years many investors have been interested in major companies like Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).

Growing investment in AI technology across industries and by businesses of all sizes is expected to gain traction over the next years. The global AI market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 20.1% from $387.45 billion in 2022 to $1394.30 billion in 2029. In 2021 the size of the worldwide market was USD 328.34 billion (see 15 biggest AI companies in the world).

However due to inflation rising interest rates and other substantial headwinds throughout the preceding year many of the market’s top artificial intelligence stocks were decimated as investors turned their focus to more traditional equities. While the year has been challenging for all stock indexes the small-cap Russell 2000 Index started to buck the trend in July when it increased by 3.6%. The S&P 500 on the other hand rose by 3% suggesting that the small-cap index may ultimately start to outpace it.

Small-cap firms continue to trade for less when markets are unstable and many investors see them as suitable investment options with promising near-term returns. So now let’s look at the 11 best small-cap AI stocks to invest in.

Methodology

In order to come up with our list of the best small-cap stocks to invest in we need to identify the list of small-cap artificial intelligence stocks. For this purpose we used iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF’s (IRBO) holdings that are smaller than $10 billion in market cap. These stocks aren’t pure artificial intelligence stocks as all ETFs lump robotics and artificial intelligence in the same bucket and most of these companies operate in other sectors as well. In order to determine the best small-cap AI stocks we ranked IRBO’s small-cap holdings using Insider Monkey’s proprietary hedge fund sentiment data. So our rankings list the best small cap AI stocks to buy according to hedge funds. You should keep in mind that some of these stocks are also shorted by another group of hedge funds however this doesn’t change the fact the following 11 AI stocks are very popular among hedge funds.

(NYSE:ESTC) has not disclosed churn but at their recent investor day they disclosed that the software (which powers search for a wide range of customers including Uber and also provides observability and security solutions) has been downloaded over 3 billion times. While we cannot extrapolate cleanly to the number of active users because one user can do multiple downloads as versions are updated the active users should dwarf the company’s 19000 paying customers. One thing is clear – once a customer is “landed” they tend to spend more in the subsequent years. Elastic’s net revenue retention has hovered around 130% for several years.…” (Click here to read the full text)

You may recall from my Q1 letter that I initiated a position in the stock given the potential for a new CEO to leverage the company’s passionate and engaged userbase. The investment had meaningful upside potential (multiples of the then trading price) but also presented real downside risk; as such I kept our exposure to just a few percentage points of the portfolio. Fast forward six months and underlying trends like churn engagement and new users weakened dramatically. I sold our shares as the likelihood for the company to achieve financial success has become increasingly remote.”

Longleaf Partners mentioned Lumen Technologies Inc. (NYSE:LUMN) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:

“Lumen Technologies Inc. (NYSE:LUMN) – Global fiber company Lumen was the top detractor in the quarter. In September the company announced a new CEO Kate Johnson would take over for Jeff Storey. Johnson has a strong track record of delivering organic revenue growth the primary area where Lumen has struggled. Johnson held previous roles at GE and Microsoft where she most recently served as head of Microsoft US and doubled her division’s revenue in only four years. Multiple checks through our network vouch for her and suggest this leadership change is a positive upgrade that will bring the discipline and focus on sales that Lumen has been missing. The market reacted negatively with concern over the potential for another dividend cut or strategy change. We are confident the stock price reaction is highly overblown versus any impact that a potential dividend cut would have on value per share. The stock now trades at 4.5x EBITDA and we believe the best value accretive capital allocation move today is share repurchase. Shortly after quarter end Lumen closed on the sale of part of its consumer business to Apollo further improving its balance sheet and business mix.”

Like many stocks in 2022 shares of tobacco company Altria Group (MO 0.43%) haven't done well. Unlike many of those same stocks Altria stock hasn't done well over the past five years. It's down 9% over that timeframe even when factoring in its steady (and rather large) dividend. Combine that underwhelming performance with the social stigma around cigarettes -- Altria's core business -- and you have the negative sentiment that makes it hard to tempt most investors.

But the situation is not as bad as it appears on the surface. Yes Altria has had a rough few years that were marred by expensive acquisitions that flopped. Still this stock has more staying power than you might think. Here are three reasons the company isn't going anywhere and the stock could be a solid investment.

1. The bad news is already priced into the stock

Altria's struggles in recent years aren't a secret. The company wasted billions on electronic-cigarette maker Juul and has broken off its relationship with sister company Philip Morris International losing Iqos exposure in the U.S. market. This series of events explains the stock's sliding share price: It peaked near $75 in 2017 and has mostly been agony for investors ever since.

But share prices always need context. Bad news doesn't necessarily mean that a stock should keep going lower forever. One could argue that Wall Street has already punished Altria for its mistakes. The stock traded at a median price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of almost 18 over the past decade but only has a P/E of 9.5 today (using estimated 2022 earnings).

Another way to look at this is that investors are willing to pay only half as much for a dollar of Altria's profits as they typically have over the past 10 years. Can that valuation go lower? Of course; nobody can predict a bottom.

But if you're buying shares today the stock is already less risky because you're starting at a much lower valuation. Again that doesn't promise a smooth ride but the valuation at least reflects the reality that Altria has hit some rough patches.

2. A huge dividend that isn't going anywhere

Let's face it: Most investors hold Altria for its dividend. I can't say I blame them. The dividend yield is a whopping 8.2% today hard to top in this market. Altria has proved itself to be an exceptional dividend stock over time raising its dividend annually for 52 consecutive years.

Would management keep raising the dividend if the company was on the rocks? You wouldn't think so but you can look at the dividend payout ratio to prove the dividend is feasible. Below you'll see that 81% of Altria's cash flow goes to the payout roughly on par with the payout ratio a decade ago.

A steady payout ratio means that growing profits fuel dividend growth instead of management increasing the payout ratio until no profits are left for the business. Altria steadily increases its prices to make up for selling fewer cigarettes yearly. The company's operating profits have grown by an average of 5% annually over the past decade enough to slightly bump up the dividend every year.

3. The ace in the hole that could keep growing

It's not discussed much but Altria owns a roughly 10% stake in beer conglomerate Anheuser-Busch InBev. It's genuinely a financial ace in the hole worth about $12 billion today. That stake represents about 15% of Altria's market cap. The company could sell that stake at any time for billions of dollars to pay down debt fuel another acquisition or repurchase a tremendous number of shares.

Anheuser-Busch is still financially getting its feet under it from a heavily indebted balance sheet and its struggles during COVID-19. At one point the brewer's market cap was as high as $240 billion meaning Altria's stake could double in value if the company ever finds its former highs again.

Not only does the stake give Altria financial flexibility but it's also a safety net for shareholders should its business ever face financial distress. When you factor in the company's well-funded dividend and this multibillion-dollar stake it's clear that Altria is still rock-solid.

Shopping online means never really knowing if that shirt or those pants will fit. But going into the store means well physically going to a mall. It also means awkward moments in a fitting room where I need to get the attention of a clerk to bring me a different size or color. Often I don't even bother and then go years between buying new pants.

Yet here I was at the Americana at Brand in Glendale California the weekend before Christmas doing a bit of last-minute holiday shopping with my family. Mostly out of curiosity and some cynicism I stepped inside Amazon Style the online retail giant's concept clothing store and actually found myself having a fun time.

By merging its online shopping experience with a revamped high-tech fitting room it made me actually want to spend more time looking at clothes. For once I didn't feel the awkwardness or rushed anxiety that comes with trying things on in a changing room. This store is just one of two in the world (the other being in Columbus Ohio) but I hope this is less an experiment and more the way all retailers start to think about their clothes shopping experience.

Amazon's forays in the brick-and-mortar world have been varied and at times puzzling. There are the fully automated Amazon Go stores where you grab an item and automatically get charged when you leave. Amazon also has its own supermarket concept which sits alongside its chain of Whole Foods Markets. Then there were the bookstores and pop-up shops which the company shuttered this year.

Amazon declined to comment on its plans for the Amazon Style store.

As with Amazon's other stores the key to the experience lies in its shopping app. At first glance Amazon Style looks like any other clothing shop with a few knick-knacks in the front and sections for men's and women's clothing.

Once you've scanned a few items Amazon Style employees will set up a room for you with the clothes you've chosen. It's all done through the app. Roger Cheng/CNET

But upon closer inspection there are some subtle differences. Each article of clothing appears once – there are no different sizes. The prices are the same as what you'd pay online although there are discounts if you spend more. Flanking one side of the store is a row of fitting rooms – with more rooms taking up the entire second floor.

It's those fitting rooms where Amazon Style really sets itself apart. Rather than randomly find an empty room I use the app to scan a few articles of clothing that I want to try and tell it that I want to ""start a room."" An employee then gathered the selections and put them in a fitting room. After about seven minutes the app notified me that one was ready and directed me to a specific fitting room number which I unlocked using my app.

Once inside I saw the various shirts and jackets I scanned hanging on a rack or neatly folded on top of the shelf below. In addition there were a few extra items added based on what Amazon thought I might like. Curiously there was a Calvin Klein shirt on top of the pile a ""sponsored item"" that was essentially a pop-up ad come to life (I didn't bother to try it on).

On the wall to my right was a large touchscreen that displayed my selections and offered recommendations for other items I might like. I could also request different sizes and styles and have them delivered to my fitting room.

Rather than a store clerk knocking on my door and handing me the clothes the items are delivered through the closet to the right of the clothes rack. It takes a few minutes but when the items are ready the closet door locks and a red light flashes. Inside the back of the closet opens up allowing an Amazon Style employee to hang the new clothes. Once the red light goes off I open the door on my side and there they are.

The fitting room has a closet that opens on the backend allowing employees to deliver additional articles of clothing for you. Roger Cheng/CNET

The touchscreen and the fitting room take the best parts of the physical shopping experience and the online one and mash them into an effective hybrid. It's so simple yet removes so much of the hassle from the shopping experience. I came into the store on a whim but left with a white Adidas jumper.

It actually has me looking forward to the next time I need a new pair of pants. Maybe in 2024?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cHBseWNoYWluYnJhaW4uY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzM2MzM1LWFtYXpvbi1sb29rcy10by1zZWxsLWV4Y2Vzcy1haXItY2FyZ28tc3BhY2UtYXMtZGVtYW5kLWNvb2xz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon Looks to Sell Excess Air Cargo Space as Demand Cools,"

Amazon.com Inc. is trying to sell excess space on its cargo planes according to people familiar with the matter its latest effort to adjust from a rapid pandemic-era expansion to a slowdown in online growth.

The e-commerce retailer which has a fleet of about 100 planes in the U.S. and Europe in recent months has hired executives with experience marketing cargo space for airlines. Possibilities include filling empty jets returning from Hawaii and Alaska with pineapples and salmon according to two of the people. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on the plans.

The long-term plan for Amazon Air hasn’t changed despite the current turmoil said one of the people who asked not to be identified as the discussions are confidential. The pressure to make money from unused space aboard its jets is increasing as the company looks to boost profits in a period of slower revenue growth another person said.

Amazon unveiled the air cargo service in 2016 prompting speculation that it would ultimately create an overnight delivery network to rival United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. Amazon Air operates out of smaller regional airports close to its warehouses around the country helping the Seattle-based company quickly move inventory to accommodate one- and two-day delivery.

The company’s ultimate goal has befuddled industry experts who have written conflicting reports about Amazon’s ambitions. Fast growth in its earlier years and a $1.5 billion investment in a hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport fueled speculation that the company was ramping up to be an overnight parcel service. Other investors said Amazon remains far shy of larger carriers like FedEx and UPS which have more planes and more flight connections that don’t overlap with Amazon’s core online retail business.

Demand for air cargo has cooled this year and is expected to tail off again in 2023. IATA an airline trade group projects the sector will generate sales of $149.4 billion about $52 billion less than 2022 but still $48.6 billion more than in 2019.

Amazon’s flights in September grew at their slowest pace since the start of the pandemic according to researchers with DePaul University’s Chaddick Institute for Metropolitan Development who have been monitoring Amazon Air flights since 2020.

Despite slowing demand Amazon in October announced it would add 10 Airbus A330-300 freighters starting next year through a partnership with Hawaiian Airlines. Amazon plans to also trim its fleet by not renewing some leases for aircraft with Air Transport Services Group two of the people said.

Even the largest package carriers are tightening belts as consumers resume pre-pandemic spending habits which takes pressure off the shipping industry. FedEx on Dec. 20 unveiled plans to cut $3.7 billion in expenses next year with the cost cuts including using digital tools to rebalance flights between company-owned jets and lifts from third-party operators.

Amazon is offering space on its planes and charter flights said one of the people. The effort is the latest maneuver to address slowing online sales and a fragile economy that could be on the brink of recession including subletting excess warehouse space and eliminating an estimated 10000 jobs."

Utilities have been one of the hottest topics of 2022 as the Russian invasion of Ukraine ushered in a wave of inflation especially in Europe. In fact in the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) energy inflation stood at 28.1% on average. The bulk of this inflation was contributed by 13 countries all of which saw energy inflation soar above a painful 30%. The largest inflation was in Italy where energy prices soared by a whopping 71% annually in October.

The U.S on the other hand saw relatively 'muted' energy inflation that stood at just 17.3% in the same month. This was the third lowest among all G7 economies and the primary reason that Americans remained better off was that they do not rely on Russian energy imports. However this does not mean that prices are low as natural gas and coal shortages have nevertheless pushed up retail utility prices to five year highs especially as record natural gas prices ended up driving the cost of producing electricity. For America these price increases are unavoidable since the largest portion (35.4%) of electricity is generated via natural gas. The price volatility itself has expedited the shift to renewable energy among utilities according to the IEA.

However these prices which end up in massive profits for power producers do have a silver lining. According to Bloomberg these companies are selling excess capacity at lower prices - rates that coal and gas producers cannot match. This according to analysts can end up putting the coal companies out of business and reducing emissions in the long term. The latest in the U.S. energy and utility sector these days is Winter Storm Elliott which has disrupted oil and gas output - which in turn has led to higher prices and power blackouts all over the country. U.S. benchmark oil prices jumped to $79.56 a barrel while power prices soared to $3700 per megawatt hour. Some oil companies that suffered from the reduced output are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC).

Today we will look at which companies are the largest when it comes to providing electricity and gas to Americans. Some largest U.S. utilities are Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO).

From now on visitors to the American Airlines Center will be greeted by a bronze 23-foot sculpture of the Hall of Famer doing his signature move: the one-legged fadeaway.

Feast your eyes on this thing:

In front of a crowd of fans -- and players including Luka Doncic the heir to Nowitzki's throne and former teammate Shawn Marion -- Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban unveiled the statue with the help of Nowitzki's seven-year-old son Max. ""Three two one"" Cuban said. ""Bam!""

Nowitzki was drafted No. 9 in 1999 and booed at home as a rookie. He made his first of 14 All-Star appearances in 2002 was named Most Valuable Player in 2007 led the Mavericks to their first and only championship in 2011 and retired in 2019 as the franchise leader in virtually everything. He spent the entirety of his extraordinary 21-year NBA career in Dallas.

""Merry Christmas"" Nowitzki said to the crowd. ""Thank you guys for sharing your Christmas morning with us and with me. It means a ton I'm truly humbled. I'm going to leave you guys with a motto."" He then explained that on the base of the statue there is a sentence underneath his name. ""It is actually 21 letters for 21 years and I think it sums up my career here for the Dallas Mavericks perfectly. And it says 'Loyalty never fades away.'""

In a press conference Nowitzki said that he asked himself what people associated with him in Dallas ""and it was these two things"" via the Dallas Morning News' Brad Townsend. ""It was the fadeaway and the loyalty. So we kind of combined that. And it's just a little fun fact that it happens to be 21 letters. So the 21 years [and 21 letters] that was more luck than really design. But I just wanted to think of something that people associate me with here in my new home. And I kind of felt it fit perfect."" He also said that his nine-year-old daughter Malaika thinks ""everything Papa does is embarrassing"" and his six-year-old son Morris was too shy to press the button with him and Max via the Dallas Morning News' Callie Caplan.

The statue is the work of Omri Amrany the sculptor behind the Michael Jordan statue in Chicago and the Magic Johnson and Shaquille O'Neal statues in Los Angeles among others. He told D Magazine that he had ""started bugging"" Cuban over email after Nowitzki's last home game -- the Mavericks honored Nowitzki post-game and during the ceremony Cuban promised Nowitzki ""the biggest most badass statue ever.""

In a team-produced video Nowitzki said that was the first he'd heard of him getting a statue in front of the arena:

Here's Nowitzki describing the ceremony as ""super special"" and ""super emotional"" and appearing to be generally thrilled about the whole thing:

You can watch the entire statue unveiling on the team's official YouTube channel.

When I first joined TPG in June 2021 achieving even entry-level elite airline status seemed like an impossible hurdle for someone like myself; I did not have a cobranded airline credit card and I traveled inconsistently — especially compared to my colleagues some of whom travel weekly.

Therefore I knew I wouldn't earn status via credit card spending or travel alone. Instead I would have to strategically earn status and look for additional more creative ways to contribute. I began to think of my status approach as various income streams that provide multiple ways to earn Loyalty Points — the points are American Airlines' status currency and are based on distance spending and fare class flown.

For me it came down to flying consistent domestic flights with a few long-haul flights sprinkled in; I also prioritized staying at Hyatt properties when traveling and intermittently shopping online through the AA shopping portal whenever possible.

Here's how I earned mid-tier American Airlines AAdvantage status and how you can apply the below tactics to your own American Airlines status goals.

Earn points on flights

I went from never holding airline status to becoming an American Airlines AAdvantage Gold member in about eight months.

Since becoming an AAdvantage member on July 15 2021 I have flown on 17 American Airlines flights and earned Loyalty Points from all but two of them which I used award miles to book. As a friendly reminder only paid flights count toward status. Of these 17 flights 11 were domestic flights (mostly short-haul regional flights within the East Coast and Midwest minus a one-way flight from Washington D.C. to Phoenix).

These domestic flights combined added 12746 Loyalty Points to my account.

In December 2021 I attended a TPG retreat in Scottsdale Arizona where I won 30000 Loyalty Points in a raffle. When these points appeared in my account on March 1 2022 I instantly had entry-level Gold status through Feb. 28 2023. With this 30000-point AAdvantage adjustment I had just less than 45000 Loyalty Points total thanks to the approximate 15000 Loyalty Points I had earned in the preceding seven months of AAdvantage membership.

Needless to say this is unusual and wouldn't have happened outside of my TPG employment. Still it turned me into an American loyalist and I began prioritizing flights on American and Oneworld partner airlines when possible. It also meant I now earned a 40% mileage bonus as a Gold member equal to 7 miles per dollar spent on flights — which is 2 miles more than a non-status flyer.

This also began my quest to reach Platinum for 2023.

Beyond the aforementioned domestic flights I took two international round-trip flights to Paris and Singapore this year. However only my trip to Singapore contributed to my Loyalty Points earnings (even though it wasn't an American flight).

When I traveled to Paris this spring I flew French Bee from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to Paris-Orly Airport (ORY); I used award miles to fly from ORY to O'Hare International Airport (ORD) so I didn't get any points from either trip.

As I looked ahead to the end of the year I knew my best bet to reach Platinum for 2023 was by booking a long-haul flight in a premium cabin; you earn bonus miles that qualify toward your Loyalty Points balance when you fly premium economy business class or first class.

To do this I took a rather indirect flight route from ORD to Singapore Changi Airport (SIN). The route was a round-trip flight on Finnair in October across four segments: ORD-Helsinki Airport (HEL) HEL-SIN SIN-HEL and HEL-ORD. In total I flew more than 2000 miles over five days to earn 28554 American Loyalty Points through Finnair a Oneworld member.

Together these two long-haul premium flights comprised nearly 39000 Loyalty Points which on their own would be enough to beat the threshold of 30000 Loyalty Points for American Gold status.

AA.COM

Even so I was still short 6371 points to reach Platinum as of November 2022. I planned on reaching it via three trips:

ORD to LaGuardia Airport (LGA) in December 2022: Base fare of $422.20 for a total of 2955 Loyalty Points and award miles.

ORD to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) in January 2023: Base fare of $229.77 for a total of 1608 Loyalty Points and award miles.

ORD to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) in January 2023: Base fare of $255.81 for a total of 1790 Loyalty Points and award miles.

Use American's shopping portal

AADVANTAGE SHOPPING PORTAL

Although I was focusing on earning Loyalty Points mainly via flights I earned Platinum earlier than expected thanks to my Black Friday online shopping via the AAdvantage shopping portal.

This is perhaps the easiest way to earn Loyalty Points since you're shopping for purchases you were already going to make. American's eShopping portal rewards users with base miles that count as Loyalty Points for purchases made at participating retailers.

As of December 2022 miles earned from online shopping with AAdvantage eShopping count toward Loyalty Points at a 1:1 ratio. The number of miles you earn depends on the specific retailer and price point. For example I earned almost 4000 Loyalty Points through purchases made at Hunter Boots Alo Yoga Lululemon and Gap based on their earnings offerings and transaction totals.

AA.COM

Those Loyalty Points along with my round-trip flight last week from ORD to LGA were enough to reach Platinum this month ahead of schedule.

Become loyal to 1 airline and alliance

As you read I became an American Airlines loyalist by default. Even before becoming a status holder though I organically opted to fly American over other carriers based on route availability out of my then-home airports DCA and Dulles International Airport (IAD).

Although I primarily fly from Chicago these days American has a large enough presence at ORD to make the longer commuter to O'Hare in the northwest suburbs versus the city's Midway International Airport (MDW) worth it.

Once you decide on an airline be sure to take advantage of alliance perks; American status opens the door to the 13 Oneworld member airlines that connect passengers to 900-plus destinations in more than 170 countries. Popular Oneworld airlines include Alaska Airlines Cathay Pacific Japan Airlines and Qatar Airways.

By flying on these other carriers as an AAdvantage Sapphire member I get reciprocal benefits on partner flights including priority check-in and boarding plus lounge access when traveling internationally. I can also access American's signature Flagship lounges when departing on or connecting to a same-day qualifying international flight in any class including at ORD.

Take advantage of the Hyatt-American partnership

As of last year AAdvantage members can earn World of Hyatt points for qualifying American flights and all World of Hyatt elite members can earn World of Hyatt points on qualifying American flights. More specifically this partnership allows:

World of Hyatt elite members to earn 1 Hyatt point for every eligible dollar spent on qualifying American Airlines flights.

AAdvantage elite members to earn 1 AAdvantage mile for every eligible dollar spent on qualifying Hyatt stays and experiences.

These points are bonus earnings in addition to the World of Hyatt points you'd already earn on stays and the American miles you'd already earn on flights. This partnership helped expedite my way to becoming a World of Hyatt Discoverist the first tier of Hyatt status.

As a Discoverist I earn 5 World of Hyatt points per dollar spent on eligible stays at Hyatt.

Bottom line

Though I did not expect to secure AAdvantage Platinum for several more months I was pleasantly surprised to earn it ahead of schedule.

Now it's on to my next goal: obtaining Platinum Pro by March 2024.

Admittedly there’s some horrible weather out there though the current operational performance at airlines is jaw-droppingly bad.

Airlines cancel & delay up to 90% of flights

All major airlines in the United States are having some operational issues at the moment given the weather system that we’re seeing. There have been issues for several days now though I thought it would be interesting to take a look at some data from Christmas day.

Historically December 25 has been a pretty quiet and smooth day for traveling since most people try to avoid traveling on Christmas itself. This year it’s a different story. Just how bad did airlines do? According to data from FlightAware:

Alaska had issues with 64% of flights — 21% were canceled 43% were delayed

Allegiant had issues with 47% of flights — 9% were canceled 38% were delayed

American had issues with 26% of flights — 0% were canceled 26% were delayed

Delta had issues with 46% of flights — 21% were canceled 25% were delayed

Frontier had issues with 48% of flights — 8% were canceled 40% were delayed

JetBlue had issues with 70% of flights — 11% were canceled 59% were delayed

Southwest had issues with 90% of flights — 42% were canceled 48% were delayed

Spirit had issues with 73% of flights — 25% were canceled 48% were delayed

United had issues with 52% of flights — 9% were canceled 43% were delayed

While no airlines did great there’s still a huge amount of variation here. Southwest had a horrible day with 90% of flights impacted. Alaska JetBlue and Spirit also did quite bad. American meanwhile was an outlier in being fairly operationally reliable (it’s not often you hear that!).

Southwest is doing the worst this holiday season

Why are airlines operating so unreliably?

Obviously there’s bad weather in many parts of the country right now but on the surface that doesn’t explain why airlines are having problems to the extent that we’re seeing. Canceling and delaying 90% of flights? That can’t directly be attributed to weather.

The pandemic shut down global travel for some amount of time. Then in early 2021 we saw a huge boost in demand for travel (at least domestically within the United States) and that trend has continued ever since. For well over 18 months now we’ve seen airlines struggling with getting sufficient staffing.

However both airlines and the government have been working to put plans in place to ensure that this would be a smooth holiday travel season. Where did things go wrong? We expect some number of cancelations with the current weather situation but why have things gotten so bad?

Well this appears to be the perfect storm for airlines both literally and figuratively. Airlines seem to have been fully prepared for a standard holiday travel season though weren’t prepared for a complicated holiday travel season.

Airline operations are incredibly complex and when there’s an issue in one part of the system there’s a huge domino effect throughout a carrier’s entire network. Worst of all there’s no easy way to simply “reset” things given that planes and crews in one city will often be needed in another city to operate a flight.

The perfect example of how this goes beyond weather is Southwest Airlines’ meltdown in Denver. Several days ago the airline declared a state of emergency threatening to fire ramp workers for a variety of reasons. The airline was so short staffed among ramp workers that some flights had to turn around once already in the air due to lack of staff in Denver. At least in some situations it sure seems like airlines had quite a few people call in sick without enough replacements to perform essential tasks.

While we can hope that airline operational performance improves somewhat expect that it will be several days before things return to normal. Even once flights do operate normally it still doesn’t mean everyone will be able to get to their destination. Flights are packed so the people who were on canceled flights are struggling to get rebooked due to lack of available seats.

It’s a very rough holiday travel season

Bottom line

Operationally airlines in the United States had the worst Christmas in years and there are no signs of things improving significantly. The horrible weather we’ve seen around the country precipitated this though airlines also share some of the blame.

Airlines largely don’t have sufficient staffing to deal with operational issues during periods of peak demand. While airlines have promised that they’re back to being able to operate reliably the current performance suggests otherwise.

In fairness some airlines (like American) are doing quite well while others (like Southwest) aren’t.

If you’re traveling this holiday season what has your experience been like?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvZGVjLzI2L21hdmVyaWNrcy1ob25vci1ub3dpdHpraS13aXRoLTI0LWZvb3Qtc3RhdHVlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mavericks honor Nowitzki with 24-foot statue | Arkansas Democrat Gazette,"DALLAS -- Dirk Nowitzki stood with his son Max both ready to push the lever that would unveil the statue of the retired Dallas Mavericks star outside the team's arena.

It already had been revealed that the statue depicted Nowitzki's signature one-legged fadeaway jumper. Not that there ever was any question.

""That jump shot just going up to the sky creating all type of rain"" said Los Angeles Lakers Coach Darvin Ham whose team lost to the Mavericks 124-115 in the Christmas Day game that followed the Nowitzki ceremony Sunday.

Nowitzki has a street named after him not far from American Airlines Center where his jersey is in the rafters. And now there's a nearly 24-foot statue on the plaza south of the arena unveiled on a chilly but sunny morning.

""It was emotional"" said Nowitzki the only NBA player to spend all 21 seasons with the same franchise. ""When the thing went up felt like the sun was just perfect today just shining right on it.""

The biggest of those multiple moments honoring Nowitzki's career came on the 11th anniversary of the only other Christmas home game for the Mavericks.

Nowitzki was the face of the franchise then opening defense of the club's only NBA title in the lockout-delayed 2011-12 season.

The new face 23-year-old star guard Luka Doncic watched the ceremony from just behind Nowitzki with several teammates and Coach Jason Kidd.

""I'm just happy for him"" said Doncic who was Nowitzki's teammate his rookie year. ""He deserves all those things that are happening to him. The statue looks amazing.""

Kidd Nowitzki's point guard on the 2011 title team had to throw in at least a couple of barbs deciding to poke fun at the defense of the NBA's highest-scoring foreign-born player.

""They picked the right move"" Kidd told reporters later. ""I don't think they were going to use the swipe (on defense) or him passing the ball. You see his stats on passing? He was a ball hog.""

Sculptor Omri Amrany has created statues of other retired NBA stars in Michael Jordan Magic Johnson and Shaquille O'Neal. He worked mostly with Nowitzki mentor Holder Geschwindner who shaped the 7-foot German's one-legged fadeaway.

Nowitzki's family came from Germany along with Gershwindner and the 44-year-old couldn't say enough times what it meant to have his mom and dad witness the ceremony.

It came four days after Nowitzki was nominated for the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame alongside Gregg Popovich coach of Texas rival San Antonio retired Spurs guard Tony Parker and Dwyane Wade who beat Nowitzki in the 2006 NBA Finals with Miami before losing to him with LeBron James in 2011.

Nowitzki's title came the year James and Chris Bosh joined Wade and the Heat who went on to win the next two championships. Nowitzki stayed through some lean final years in Dallas mostly because he had what he wanted most.

""I'm so happy I didn't have to do that and it worked out this way"" Nowitzki said. ""Once we won the championship I knew I wanted to be here and finish my career here.""

Nowitzki is sixth on the career scoring list with 31560 points and the leader in every other significant offensive category for the Mavericks. He is a consultant for owner Mark Cuban and spends most of his time in Dallas with his wife Jessica and three children.

As the three-year statue project dragged on Nowitzki pondered the theme that would accompany the base. When it came time to decide he said he got lucky in picking something with 21 letters matching his 21 seasons with the Mavericks.

""Loyalty never fades away.""

Utilities have been one of the hottest topics of 2022 as the Russian invasion of Ukraine ushered in a wave of inflation especially in Europe. In fact in the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) energy inflation stood at 28.1% on average. The bulk of this inflation was contributed by 13 countries all of which saw energy inflation soar above a painful 30%. The largest inflation was in Italy where energy prices soared by a whopping 71% annually in October.

The U.S on the other hand saw relatively 'muted' energy inflation that stood at just 17.3% in the same month. This was the third lowest among all G7 economies and the primary reason that Americans remained better off was that they do not rely on Russian energy imports. However this does not mean that prices are low as natural gas and coal shortages have nevertheless pushed up retail utility prices to five year highs especially as record natural gas prices ended up driving the cost of producing electricity. For America these price increases are unavoidable since the largest portion (35.4%) of electricity is generated via natural gas. The price volatility itself has expedited the shift to renewable energy among utilities according to the IEA.

However these prices which end up in massive profits for power producers do have a silver lining. According to Bloomberg these companies are selling excess capacity at lower prices - rates that coal and gas producers cannot match. This according to analysts can end up putting the coal companies out of business and reducing emissions in the long term. The latest in the U.S. energy and utility sector these days is Winter Storm Elliott which has disrupted oil and gas output - which in turn has led to higher prices and power blackouts all over the country. U.S. benchmark oil prices jumped to $79.56 a barrel while power prices soared to $3700 per megawatt hour. Some oil companies that suffered from the reduced output are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC).

Today we will look at which companies are the largest when it comes to providing electricity and gas to Americans. Some largest U.S. utilities are Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO).

Such conversions are becoming more popular as battery technology gets better and the world turns toward cleaner energy sources.

EVs and classic cars

Kevin Erickson owns a 1972 Plymouth Satellite that he renamed ”Electrollite” after conversion. Now the car can go from a still position to 97 kilometers per hour in about three seconds. Its top speed is almost 250 kilometers per hour.

At the end of 2019 Erickson bought the car for $6500. He then began a year-and-a-half-long project to convert the car to electric. He used battery packs a motor and parts from a Tesla Model S that had been in a crash.

“This was my way of taking the car that I like — my favorite body — and then taking the modern technology and performance and mixing them together” said Erickson who has put about $60000 into the project.

Jonathan Klinger is vice president of car culture for Hagerty Insurance. He said converting classic cars into EVs is “definitely a trend” although research on the activity is limited.

In May the Michigan-based company did a web-based study of about 25000 automobile lovers in the United States Canada and the United Kingdom.

About one percent had at least partly converted an older model car to run on some form of electric power.

The top three reasons for converting the vehicles were for better performance for a fun project and because of environmental concerns. About 25 percent of respondents said they approve of older automobiles being partly or fully converted to electric vehicles.

Klinger who owns several vintage vehicles said he does not think electric motors will replace all gas engines — especially when considering historically important vehicles.

“There’s something satisfying about having a vintage car that has a carburetor” he said because it’s the same as when the car was new. Some car lovers want to keep the sound of older cars’ original engines.

Difficulties and the future

Electric conversions require special knowledge to complete. They also involve safety concerns and parts that are sometimes hard to find.

And then there is the price.

Sean Moudry who co-owns Inspire EV a small conversion business near Denver recently worked on a 1965 Ford Mustang. The year-and-a-half-long project cost more than $100000 and involved many difficulties.

Moudry and his partners replaced the gas engine with a motor from a crashed Tesla Model S. They also added 16 Tesla battery packs weighing a total of about 363 kilograms.

Most older cars including the Mustang were not designed to have that much weight or the increased performance of a powerful electric motor. So the team had to make changes to other parts of the car including the suspension system.

Moudry says many people do not have the resources necessary to carry out this kind of project. As a result he says it will take a while for electric conversions to become common.

“I think it’s going to be 20 years” he said. “It’s going to be a 20-year run before you go to a car show and 50 to 60 percent of the cars are running some variant of an electric motor in it.”

But that reality could be coming sooner than expected says Mike Spagnola president and CEO of the Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) a trade group.

He said that electric vehicle products took about 1950 square meters of marketing space at SEMA’s yearly show in Las Vegas this fall. That was up from only 232 square meters at the 2021 show.

Even though it’s nearly silent the classic American muscle car isn’t broken. It’s electric.

Erickson is among a small but expanding group of tinkerers racers engineers and entrepreneurs across the country who are converting vintage cars and trucks into greener and often much faster electric vehicles.

Despite derision from some purists about the converted cars resembling golf carts or remote-controlled cars electric powertrain conversions are becoming more mainstream as battery technology advances and the world turns toward cleaner energy to combat climate change.

“RC cars are fast so that’s kind of a compliment really” said Erickson whose renamed ”Electrollite” accelerates to 0-60 mph (0-97 kph) in three seconds and tops out at about 155 mph (249 kph). It also invites curious stares at public charging stations which are becoming increasingly common across the country.

At the end of 2019 Erickson a cargo pilot who lives in suburban Denver bought the car for $6500. He then embarked on a year-and-a-half-long project to convert the car into a 636-horsepower electric vehicle (475 kW) using battery packs a motor and the entire rear subframe from a crashed Tesla Model S.

“This was my way of taking the car that I like — my favorite body — and then taking the modern technology and performance and mixing them together” said Erickson who has put about $60000 into the project.

Jonathan Klinger vice president of car culture for Hagerty an insurance company and automotive lifestyle brand that specializes in collector vehicles said converting classic cars into EVs is “definitely a trend” although research on the practice is limited.

In May the Michigan-based company conducted a web-based survey of about 25000 self-identified automobile enthusiasts in the United States Canada and the United Kingdom. About 1% had either partially or fully converted their classic to run on some sort of electrified drivetrain.

The respondents’ top three reasons for converting their vehicles were for faster acceleration and improved performance for a fun and challenging project and because of environmental and emissions concerns. About 25% of respondents said they approve of classic vehicles being partially or fully converted to EVs.

“Electric vehicles deliver some pretty astonishing performance just by the nature of the mechanics of how they work” Klinger said. So it’s not surprising to him that a small percentage of people converting classic cars to EVs are interested in improving performance. He compared the current trend to the hot-rod movement of the 1950s.

But Klinger who owns several vintage vehicles said he doesn’t think electric motors will replace all internal combustion engines — especially when considering historically significant vehicles.

“There’s something satisfying about having a vintage car that has a carburetor” he said because it’s the same as when the car was new. Some enthusiasts want to preserve the sound and rumble of older cars’ original engines.

Other barriers to converting cars include the knowledge it takes to delve into such a complicated project as well as safety concerns about tinkering with high-voltage components the availability of parts and the time it takes to realize a positive environmental impact. Because classic vehicles are driven for fewer than 1500 miles (2414 kilometers) a year on average it takes longer to offset the initial carbon footprint of manufacturing the batteries Klinger said.

And then there’s the price.

Sean Moudry who co-owns Inspire EV a small conversion business in suburban Denver recently modified a 1965 Ford Mustang that was destined for the landfill. The year-and-a-half-long project cost more than $100000 and revealed several other obstacles that underscore why conversions are not “plug-and-play” endeavors.

Trying to pack enough power into the pony car to “smoke the tires off of it” at a drag strip Moudry and his partners replaced the underpowered six-cylinder gas engine with a motor from a crashed Tesla Model S. They also installed 16 Tesla battery packs weighing a total of about 800 pounds (363 kilograms).

Most classic vehicles including the Mustang weren’t designed to handle that much weight — or the increased performance that comes with a powerful electric motor. So the team had to beef up the car’s suspension steering driveshaft and brakes.

The result is a Frankenstein-like vehicle that includes a rear axle from a Ford F-150 pickup and rotors from a Dodge Durango SUV as well as disc brakes and sturdier coil-over shocks in the front and rear.

Although Ford and General Motors have or are planning to produce standalone electric “crate” motors that are marketed to classic vehicle owners Moudry says it’s still not realistic for a casual car tinkerer to have the resources to take on such a complicated project. Because of this he thinks it will take a while for EV conversions to become mainstream.

“I think it’s going to be 20 years” he said. “It’s going to be a 20-year run before you go to a car show and 50 to 60% of the cars are running some variant of an electric motor in it.”

But that reality could be coming sooner than expected according to Mike Spagnola president and CEO of the Specialty Equipment Market Association a trade group that focuses on aftermarket vehicle parts.

He said that during SEMA’s annual show in Las Vegas this fall some 21000 square feet (1951 square meters) of convention space was dedicated to electric vehicles and their parts. That was up from only 2500 square feet (232 square meters) at the 2021 show.

Companies are developing universal parts as well as lighter smaller and more powerful battery packs. They’re also creating wiring components that are easier to install and myriad other innovations. Some are even building vehicle frames with the electric motor batteries and components already installed. Buyers can just install the body of a classic vehicle on top of the platform.

“The early adopters of this would take a crashed Tesla and pull the motor and harnesses and batteries and all that out of the vehicle and find a way to shoehorn it into whatever vehicle they wanted to build” Spagnola said. “But today there are many manufacturers now starting to make components. … We’re really excited about it.”"

Membership Rewards can be earned via credit card spend new account bonuses credit card referrals and in many other ways. Once earned these points can then be transferred to airline or hotel partners used to pay for travel or merchandise and in one specific case even converted to cash back.

If you’re at all interested in free and/or luxury travel with points & miles then you need to understand the basics of Amex Membership Rewards. Here you’ll find everything you need to know.

How to earn Amex Membership Rewards Points

Credit Card Welcome Bonuses

The easiest and quickest way to earn Membership Rewards points is through Amex credit card welcome bonuses.

Most Amex welcome offers stipulate that you can’t get the bonus if you’ve ever had that card before. That said it doesn’t preclude you getting a bonus for a similarly named card. For example there quite a few versions of the high end Platinum card and it’s possible to get the welcome bonus with each and every one. Additionally targeted offers sometimes do not have that once per lifetime language. In those cases you can get the bonus even if you’ve had the card before. See: 8 ways to get the best targeted Amex welcome bonus offers.

Below are the Amex cards with the best current and public Membership Rewards welcome offers.

Card Offer

Credit Card Upgrade Bonuses

Amex frequently offers bonus points for upgrading from one card to another. For example we’ve seen 140000 point offers for upgrading from the Business Gold Rewards card to the Business Platinum card. Even better these upgrade offers usually do not have the once per lifetime language. That is if you are targeted for an upgrade offer you may be able to earn the bonus points even if you currently have the card or if you’ve had the card before.

Note that it’s best to accept these offers only after you have earned a signup bonus for the card that you’re upgrading to. Accepting an upgrade offer for a given card will make you ineligible to receive a new cardmember welcome bonus for that card if it contains Amex’s “once in a lifetime” language.

Shopping Portal Rewards

It is possible to earn Amex Membership Rewards points by starting your shopping with the Rakuten Shopping Portal. An option within the portal lets you choose whether you want to be paid via cash back or in Membership Rewards points.

In addition to earning points by clicking through to stores from the portal you can also register your credit cards with the portal to earn additional points at select stores and restaurants.

Credit Card Category Bonuses

Another great way to earn Membership Rewards points is by using the best card for different spending categories. If you spend a lot personally or through your business on any of the below categories you can do very well. Particularly noteworthy is the no-annual-fee Blue Business Plus Credit Card which offers 2 points per dollar for all spend up to $50K spend per calendar year (then 1X thereafter). That’s fantastic.

* The Amex EveryDay Preferred card earns a 50% bonus every billing period in which the card was used for 30 or more transactions. Before the 50% bonus the card has the following bonus categories: 3x points at US supermarkets on up to $6000 per year in purchases (then 1x); 2x points at US gas stations; 1x points on other purchases. After the 50% bonus it offers: 4.5x points at US supermarkets on up to $6000 per year in purchases (then 1.5x); 3x points at US gas stations; 1.5x points on other purchases.

** The Business Gold Card offers 4X on the two categories where your business spends the most each billing cycle from the following categories: ⚬ US purchases at restaurants ⚬ Airfare purchased directly from airlines ⚬ U.S. purchases for advertising in select media ⚬ U.S. purchases at gas stations ⚬ U.S. purchases for shipping ⚬ U.S. computer hardware software and cloud computing purchases made directly from select providers. 4X applies to first $150000 in combined purchases in your two categories each calendar year 1X point per dollar thereafter and on other purchases. Terms apply.

Credit Card Referrals

Yet another way to earn Membership Rewards points is by referring friends and relatives to an Amex credit or charge card. In some cases these referral bonuses can be substantial and Amex has offered as much as 30000 points for referring someone to another Amex card. However if you want to keep your friends then make sure that the offer they get is as good as the best available public offer (by comparing your referral offer to our Best Offers page).

Log into your account to check for any special referral offers.

Keep in mind that you can refer friends to other cards — even to cards you do not have. See this post for full details: Maximizing value from Amex multi-referrals

Amex Offers

Amex Offers are a great option for saving cash. But sometimes Amex Offers can also provide terrific opportunities for point-earning instead. One (now expired) example was an offer for Reebok: Spend $75 or more Get 1500 Membership Rewards points. And one for Hugo Boss: Spend $250 or more Get 5000 points.

Amex Offers can also be longer term and act more like a new category bonus in which you can get an extra Membership Rewards points per dollar spent at selected merchants. See: 2x Membership Rewards (2.5x with Everyday Preferred) at many online merchants.

Log into your account and check the section titled “Amex Offers and Benefits” to look for offers like these.

Other Options for Earning Amex Membership Rewards Points

Enroll in Pay Over Time

Once you sign up for an American Express charge card you will start getting emails and letters inviting you to sign up for the Pay Over Time. This option essentially turns your charge card into a credit card. Don’t do it. That is don’t sign up until the offer includes a bonus of 10000 to 30000 Membership Rewards points. In my experience these bonus offers usually appear towards the end of your first year of card membership (as long as you haven’t enrolled already).

Once you get an offer like the one shown above go ahead and sign up. As long as you keep paying your card’s complete balance each month there is no downside to enabling this feature.

even on the same card. However to have a chance of getting targeted for these offers you need to ensure the card isn’t currently enrolled in Pay Over Time. Amex doesn’t make it obvious how to do that b It’s possible to be repeatedly targeted for Pay Over Time enrollment bonuses. However to have a chance of getting targeted for these offers you need to ensure the card isn’t currently enrolled in Pay Over Time. Amex doesn’t make it obvious how to do that b ut you can see our post on how to unenroll here

FX International Payments

Amex offers businesses the ability to earn 1 Membership Rewards point per $30 of foreign wire payments (max 4000 points per transaction). Even better you may receive a welcome bonus offer like the one shown above (keep an eye out for this in your mailbox or email!).

How to Use Membership Rewards Points

In general Membership Rewards points are worth up to 1 cent each. Fortunately there are three ways in which it is possible to get more value: redeem points for flights transfer points to hotel or airline partners or invest rewards. More on each below…

Travel

Those with American Express Platinum cards automatically get 1 cent per point value when redeeming points for travel. That’s not particularly good but it’s much better than the value that people get without a Platinum card. Currently the only way to get better than 1 cent per point value when redeeming points for travel is with the Business Platinum Card.

The Business Platinum Card offers a 35% Airline Bonus: Get 35% of your points back when you redeem points through Amex Travel for either a First or Business class flight on any airline or for any flights with your selected airline.

After you receive the 35% rebate the value works out to 1.54 cents per point. That’s very good but it does require owning this ultra-premium card.

Transfer Points to Partners

The best use of Membership Rewards points in my opinion is to transfer them to airline and hotel partners in order to book high value awards. Your best bet is usually to wait until you find a great award before transferring points. One exception: Amex often offers 30% or higher transfer bonuses to certain programs (Virgin Atlantic and British Airways are two recent examples). If you’re confident that you’ll use the points for good value it may make sense to transfer points when those bonuses are in effect.

Points can be transferred to the loyalty accounts of the primary cardholder or any authorized user or employee on the account.

For specific examples of great ways to use points transferred to airline miles please see: Amex Membership Rewards sweet spots.

List of Membership Rewards Transfer Partners

It is free to transfer Membership Rewards points to foreign airlines. For transfers to US airlines however Amex charges an “excise tax offset fee” of $0.0006 per point (with a maximum fee of $99). Airlines subject to this fee are noted below.

Current Partner Transfer Bonuses

Here are the currently available transfer bonuses from Amex Membership Rewards (this table will update automatically when new offers are found):

Cash back (invest with rewards)

The best way to get cash back is to add the American Express Platinum Card for Schwab to your credit card portfolio. This card offers a benefit called “Invest with Rewards.” This allows the cardholder to deposit Membership Rewards points into a Schwab account at a value of 1.1 cents per point. For example 50000 points becomes $550.

Considering the fact that there are so many ways to earn lots of Membership Rewards points the ability to cash out at 1.1 cents per point isn’t too bad.

Note that the Morgan Stanley Platinum card also offers Invest with Rewards but only at a value of 1 cent per point.

Amex Business Checking is another way to cash out Membership Rewards but there is a bit of a catch though. The standard rate is only 0.8 cents per point which is something no one should consider doing. There is an increased rate of 1 cent per point possible but in order to get it you must also hold a Business Platinum card (and the $695 annual fee that comes with it). Also that improved rate is limited to a maximum of 1000000 points redeemed per year while the standard rate of 0.8 cents per point is unlimited.

Other ways to redeem Membership Rewards Points

You can also redeem points for gift cards or merchandise. At most with this approach you’ll get 1 cent per point value but usually you’ll get quite a bit less.

You can also use points to pay some merchants directly (Amazon.com for example). Don’t do this. These options offer very poor value. Further they may compromise the security of your account (i.e. if someone hacks into your Amazon account they might spend your Membership Rewards points – causing you a headache in getting your points reinstated).

Amex Membership Rewards Travel Sweet Spots

Our post Amex Membership Rewards sweet spots details the best value uses of Amex Membership Rewards. Either click here or click below to jump to a section of the post:

Managing Membership Rewards

Combine Points Across Cards

Amex automatically pools all of your points together. When you earn points with different cards the point total shown when viewing either card is the total across cards.

Share Points Across Cardholders

Unlike Chase and Citibank Amex doesn’t allow members to move points from one person’s account to another. That said it is possible to transfer one person’s points to another person’s loyalty program account. The key is that the person who receives the points must be an authorized user or employee on the other person’s account. For example my wife can transfer Membership Rewards points to my Virgin Atlantic account as long as I’m an authorized user (or employee) on any of her Membership Rewards cards.

In order to use this method to share points the authorized user card must be active for 90 days before it will unlock the ability to transfer your points to the authorized user’s loyalty program account.

How to Preserve a Deceased Person’s Points

If a person with Amex Membership Rewards points dies the executor of the estate or an authorized account manager can request to transfer their Membership Rewards points to another person or to redeem points in any other way (e.g. transfer to loyalty program redeem for gift cards etc.). Full details can be found here.

How to Keep Points Alive

Thankfully it is very easy to keep Amex Membership Rewards points alive. Simply keep any Membership Rewards card open. For example if you are about to close your one and only Membership Rewards card then open another Membership Rewards card account first in order to preserve your points. Amex offers some no-fee Membership Rewards cards such as the Blue Business Plus and the Amex Everyday so this shouldn’t be much of a burden.

Financial institution recruiters and tech executives consider location organizational structure and reporting structure when they are filling or applying for top technologist roles said Robert Voth managing director at executive search firm Russell Reynolds.

""COVID reset the chess table with a piece that companies had never seen before which is open location"" Voth said. ""Prior to the spring of 2020 the vast majority of CIOs moved to corporate headquarters. At the end of 2022 less than half of our searches required their chief information officer to be at corporate.""

About 70% of companies want their top technologist based at headquarters according to Jesse Reich an executive director of Russell Reynolds. In contrast about the same percentage of talent is unmotivated to relocate.

Additionally Voth said reporting structure is vital. He added that companies that don't have their chief technologists reporting to the top executive officers lose more than half of the potential talent pool.

Control of data and analytics is what Voth called ""the bait that hooks the big fish."" Top technologists want oversight because data is the key to a better understanding of customers Reich said.

Even as economic strain on the tech industry has meant more layoffs at many fintechs and Big tech companies the executive technology roles at financial institutions have remained stable Reich said.

""If you need a top technology officer you still need one in a downturn"" Reich said. ""You might have different priorities you might want to digitize your supply chain for efficiencies you might want to be moving more aggressively to the cloud and to better control your infrastructure costs…I don't necessarily think that we did fewer of those searches this year than we did last year but their priorities may have changed and their team sizes have changed.""

Here are some of the new top technologists hired at banks credit unions and fintechs in 2022:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXNlcnRzdW4uY29tL3N0b3J5L3Nwb3J0cy9nb2xmLzIwMjIvMTIvMjYvd2l0aC10aWNrZXRzLW9uLXNhbGUtZ2FsbGVyaS1jbGFzc2ljLWVkZ2luZy1jbG9zZXItdG8tZGVidXQtZXZlbnQtaW4tMjAyMy1nb2xmLXBnYS10b3VyLWNoYW1waW9ucy82OTc0MTE4NzAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With tickets on sale Galleri Classic edging closer to debut event in 2023,"As the desert’s oldest professional golf tournament The American Express prepares for its 64th event the desert’s newest tournament the PGA Tour Champions’ Galleri Classic is happy to wait in the wings for a new more weeks.

“They will have their event and we will quickly show up in many ways right as they are finished so we can keep the audience in tune to what other golf is going on” said Michelle DeLancy the tournament director for the Galleri Classic that will debut in Rancho Mirage in March.

It make sense for the Galleri Classic to keep a bit of a low profile at least until the final day of The American Express Jan. 22. First is that the senior events doesn’t want to get lost in the message of the regular PGA Tour event.

“We don’t want to confuse the audience saying that (Fred) Couples is coming and then people go to The American Express and expect Couples and then realize that it was Galleri Classic information that they saw instead” DeLancy said.

Second the Galleri Classic is still putting together the nuts and bolts for a brand new tournament even if the host course of the Dinah Shore Tournament Course at Mission Hills Country Club is a familiar setting for fans and players.

More:Desert's PGA Tour Champions event puts tickets on sale seeks volunteers

With less than 100 days until the Galleri Classic debuts DeLancy and the tournament staff are making progress toward getting everything ready for March 22 the day of the first of two one-day pro-ams that week at Mission Hills. The $2.2 million pros-only portion of the tournament begins March 24. DeLancy whose past experience running a PGA Tour Champions event was in Seattle is learning more and more about the golf-crazed Coachella Valley.

“The great thing about the area is that people love golf and they want to be involved” DeLancy said. “The LPGA event (the major championship that was held at Mission Hills for 51 years) had a great group of volunteers and a lot of them have reached out to us to say they want to be a part of this event as well.”

Putting a tournament together

Around 500 volunteers will be needed but not all of them will come from the desert. DeLancy said there is a group of volunteers from her days at the Boeing Classic in Seattle who want to come to the desert as kind of a week-long summer camp experience of volunteering in the Coachella Valley. But even people who volunteered for the LPGA event – last known as the Chevron Championship – will have a learning curve.

“They are learning what the differences are between an LPGA event and a PGA Tour Champions event and what we set up on the course different and what we might need that is different” DeLancy said. “But overall people will have a great time volunteering.”

The tournament has just in the last week put tickets on sale for the event while also selling berths into the two pro-ams.

“As you know the PGA Tour Champions players do such a great job of playing with the amateurs and speaking with the volunteers” DeLancy said. “And we always like to say they rub elbows with the volunteers and the amateurs being interactive on the course with fans as I’m sure the LPGA players were as well.”

That comparison between the new PGA Tour Champions event and the LPGA event that was played at Mission Hills for 51 years is certainly something that will be part of the new event. How will the course setup be different? Will the seniors actually outdraw the LPGA or was the LPGA major always going to draw more fans even in its later days of fewer fans? How will the scoring be different between the senior male players and the LPGA players?

“I hope that people will hopefully be pleasantly surprised to attend the event and see that while it looks familiar the PGA Tour Champions plays a whole lot different than what the LPGA did” DeLancy said.

DeLancy said she has talked to and received notes from most of the top PGA Tour Champions players telling her their interest in being part of the 78-player field at Mission Hills. She said it might actually be tough to fill all the requests because so many players want to be in the first official event in the desert since 1993.

“It’s in an area a lot of those guys are familiar with as you've seen them at the Bob Hope (now The American Express) and everything else in the past” DeLancy said. “There are guys who have lived in the area including Mission Hills who are just happy to be back.”

Akre,"Because learning from the best allows you to excel here is a new series of articles on legendary investors those who have made history with their vision their approach and their performance. Let's start with Charles T. Akre the founder of Akre Capital Management.

Charles T. Akre known as ""Chuck"" to those in the know founded Akre Capital Management in 1989 after spending 21 years in the securities industry at Johnston Lemon & Co. where he managed various parts of the business including branch office management research and asset management.

From June 1993 Chuck co-managed Akre Capital Management under Friedman Billings and Ramsey before taking over the lead in 2000 when he moved the company to the rural village of Middleburg Virginia away from the frenzy of Wall Street much like Warren Buffett who moved to Omaha.

Today Akre Capital Management has become a highly regarded and recognized asset management firm with now $15 billion in assets in private partnerships mutual funds (the Akre Focus Fund) and separately managed accounts. The portfolio managers of the Akre Focus Fund (whose management composition and performance we will detail) are Mr. John Neff and Mr. Chris Cerrone.

Chuck Akre and Warren Buffett

Chuck Akre has been largely influenced by the writings of Warren Buffett and in particular his perception of shareholder value creation. Warren Buffett believes that every company has a value determined by its financial statements and his goal has always been to buy profitable companies below their intrinsic value. These companies are ultimately identified by their high returns on assets and capital. When these high returns appear Buffett argues that there is some sort of economic royalty and that the value of the company is far greater than what the balance sheet reveals. Chuck reasons in the same way focusing on the growth of the company's book value and cash flow. This means finding highly profitable businesses with the right capital allocation to reinvest the money generated over the course of the year to continue to grow and increase the value of the business.

The management team led by Chuck looks for companies that can perform in any macroeconomic environment. They make few investment decisions each year. They prefer to take time to form an opinion and understand the quality of the company. It can sometimes take years to analyze a business.

Akre has personally invested alongside Warren Buffett. He bought about 40 shares of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) in 1977 - when he was a young broker - for $120. The stock is now worth 3928 times what he paid at the time. Unfortunately for him he sold 39 of his 40 shares at $500 to finance a conversion project and get into real estate sometime in the 1980s. That $19500 would have become more than $18 million today.

Fortunately for him he has had many other successes. Take American Tower (AMT) one of the most successful real estate ventures in the United States in the last 20 years. Chuck took a stake in its IPO following its spin-off from American Radio in 1998. He paid about 80 cents for his AMT shares. The stock is now trading around $230.

Investment Philosophy

Chuck and his firm Akre Capital Management's investment philosophy is based on compound interest (the power of compounding). To understand it I'll tell you the story of the Native Americans selling the island of Manhattan.

The story goes that the selling party in the transaction which took place in 1626 collected beads and trinkets worth an estimated $20. Let's assume that the sellers invested their initial $20 at a rate of 9% per year and maintained that investment program for the next 380 years.

Today their initial $20 would be worth more than $3335000000000000000.

This example shows us that the rate of return on an investment does not have to be extraordinary to produce extraordinary results. What is crucial is to have the ability to maintain an investment program without interruption over a very long period of time. In the real world of investing life sometimes gets in the way. It is rare that an investor can enjoy decades of compounding in an investment without being interrupted by the need to sell positions in order to finance a project or a real estate purchase (and thus pay taxes on their capital gains). This story is simply a reminder that the pursuit of sustained uninterrupted compounded returns over long periods of time is smart investing and that is precisely what Akre is all about.

Many people consider Akre's teams to be ""value investors"" while others wonder if they are ""growth investors"". However in any investment thesis there is an expected value at a certain time horizon and a projected growth expected. Trying to permanently oppose the two is illusory and limiting. And by the way Akre's teams claim to be on neither side. They are compound investors which means that they try to invest in companies that have the ability to generate compound interest over several years. Thinking like a compounding investor is very natural for private investors corporate executives or business angels with a long-term vision. The owner wants to focus carefully on a few business investments and hopes that the accountants will report regularly at the end of each year that the equity per share has increased. It does not think about trying to move investments in and out on a daily or monthly basis. It buys and holds.

This approach is so fundamental but it is often overlooked. it has become all too easy to get distracted by hour-to-hour market fluctuations and all the macro-economic turmoil with short-term news. To be a compounding investor you have to tune out the short-term noise.

Yet in the real world companies change. So you have to be constantly vigilant about those changes. Some companies deteriorate over the years while others improve and Akre's investment portfolio therefore evolves progressively.

A different process

The management teams invest in a small number of companies that they consider extraordinary and that are led by talented and honest managers who reinvest free cash flow wisely. Their investment objective is to ""compound"" investors' capital at above-average rates of return over extended periods of time while incurring a below-average level of risk.

Just as a good recipe requires good ingredients Akre's management teams have been looking at the essential ingredients for a company to create value.

These key ingredients are :

An ability to generate above-average returns on shareholder capital

Opportunities to deploy additional capital at above-average returns

A management team with the skills and judgment to sustain the capitalization process over a long period of time in a competitive environment

They called this triptych ""the three-legged stool"". This metaphor describes what they look for in an investment:

An extraordinary company

Talented management

Great reinvestment opportunities

A track record of investment success

Chuck has an old three-foot milking stool that he stores in the conference room of Akre's Middleburg building. Clearly three legs are both essential (two legs are a downer) and sufficient (the fourth leg is optional).

Asset management at Akre Capital is different in two main ways:

First their decision to buy or sell a company's stock is based on the same fundamental criteria. They do not set sales price targets when buying a stock because they do not seek to trade stocks simply on the basis of their price performance. Rather they seek to compound the capital they manage and initiate sales discussions when one or more of the legs of the stool are ""broken.""

Their track record over the years proves them right.

Second Wall Street's obsession with what fund managers call the ""beat by a penny miss by a penny"" syndrome often gives them the opportunity to make investments at attractive valuations. They focus on the growth in underlying economic value per share - often defined as book value per share - over time. Their time horizon is set at five or ten years and quarterly ""misses"" often create opportunities for the capital they manage.

Most investors seek information about companies by reading annual reports attending trade shows meeting with management and studying key financial metrics. For many their investment theses closely follow management's rhetoric and are fooled by colorful company presentations and complex but highly uncertain financial models.

Their approach instead emphasizes the importance of wisdom by subtraction. They strive to get beyond the non-essential details and ignore the often deafening noise. They want to identify the ""essence"" the substance of each company to understand their true business model and their competitive advantages.

I invite you to practice this if you are a long-term investor. It is a difficult process but the rewards are worth it. Once armed with this deep understanding you can focus on what really matters and not be too alarmed about what doesn't. Quarterly reports or Fed minutes for example become much less of an ""event"" all of a sudden. I really appreciate this long term approach and that's why I wanted to focus on Akre Capital Management.

Coming back to the investment process (called ""the three-legged stool"") let's go into detail about the three steps. These three steps allow us to filter (Charlie Munger-style logic of subtraction) almost all listed companies so that only companies qualified as ""extraordinary"" remain.

Business model filter: The management team looks for companies with (1) high consistent and predictable free cash flow generation and return on equity (ROE); (2) identified sustainable competitive advantages; (3) pricing power above costs (which is a protection against inflation); (4) a business model that is easy to understand by avoiding over-regulated companies; (5) having a strong balance sheet (low debt and low cost of debt).

Management filter: The management team looks for companies with (6) a competent honest and passionate management team (7) that treat shareholders as partners and (8) that are not too preoccupied by the will of Wall Street; (9) a corporate culture that fosters accountability and independence of mind; and (10) rational compensation packages.

Akre Capital Management's portfolio

Akre's teams manage a concentrated portfolio (Akre Focus Fund) with a low turnover. The portfolio is focused where warranted and positions are weighted according to confidence in the investment thesis.

It is comprised of 19 stocks but the top 10 positions account for nearly 74% of the portfolio and has significant exposure to technology (42.8%) financials (21.4%) real estate (11.3%) and consumer discretionary (10.7%).

John Landis’ 1981 hit was that rare horror comedy that actually pulled off both the horror and the comedy put makeup on the Oscars map and developed the kind of cult status that only the foolhardy would dare mess with. Yet that didn’t stop more than a dozen screenwriters and directors including Landis himself from giving it a go.

Stuck in development hell for much of the ‘90s An American Werewolf in Paris finally made it into theaters 16 years after the original. That explains why instead of two clean-cut middle-class hikers the film’s travelers are a trio of thrill-seeking bros who seem to have escaped from MTV’s Spring Break. Vince Vieluf’s Brad and Phil Buckman’s Chris in particular are so obnoxious with their opening scene talk of “sex points” that you immediately start praying for them to get mauled by a wild-eyed lycanthrope.

Thankfully their other traveling companion is a little more likable. Andy McDermott (Tom Everett Scott recapturing the nice guy charm of his breakthrough performance in That Thing You Do!) also becomes an instant hero after saving Julie Delpy’s suicidal Sérafine from getting splattered below the Eiffel Tower with a quick-thinking bungee jump.

This dramatic meet-cute sets the Parisian tale on a more romantic path than its earlier visions. Landis wanted to center the sequel on an investigation into the tragic deaths of David Naughton and Griffin Dunne’s backpackers bailing on the project when Polygram snubbed his first draft. John Lafia’s (Child’s Play) concept of a turned schoolteacher trailed by the original’s Dr. Hirsch was also reportedly turned down and then Tom Stern was briefly appointed to helm a story about a tourist whose uncle falls victim to a mysterious critter. The latter however did receive a screenwriting credit alongside collaborator Tim Burns and Anthony Waller the man who replaced Marco Brambilla (Demolition Man) in the director’s chair.

Julie Delpy like you’ve never seen her before. Buena Vista Pictures

Sérafine and Andy’s love story is hampered by the fact that Delpy – who’d just starred in perhaps the decade’s finest transatlantic big-screen romance Before Sunrise – and Scott share zero chemistry. Even when the Parisian gratuitously goes topless while straddling the American in bed the pair still look like they’d rather be feasting on human heart smoothies.

Of course the two unconvincing lovebirds do get to enjoy some liquified flesh: By this point it’s been revealed that Sérafine starts growing fangs and an inordinate amount of body hair whenever there’s a full moon. Andy meanwhile is just learning that the mutant that bit him the night before has handed him the same fate.

You might expect that Andy’s metamorphosis from mild-mannered human into uncontrollable all-devouring beast would be the one area that An American Werewolf in Paris improves on its London-based counterpart. Although Rick Baker’s prosthetics astounded at the time deservedly picking up the inaugural Academy Award for Best Make-Up and Effects they’d inevitably become dated. But the over-reliance on shoddy CGI renders the sequel’s transformations entirely unconvincing: The victims always look like they’re being attacked by a PS1 monster rather than a flesh-and-blood creature.

Waller whose more impressive 1995 directorial debut Mute Witness had ironically focused on a horror movie makeup artist is far more successful inducing laughs than scares. Future Modern Family star Julie Bowen gets many of the best lines as Andy’s first slay Amy an amusingly annoying airhead who returns to haunt her killer in rotting zombie form (“It took me four years on a Stairmaster to get a package like this. You ripped through it like a lamb chop!”).

He also makes interesting use of the Gallic setting largely eschewing the more obvious reference points for lesser-known landmarks. Before ripping her to shreds Andy gets carnal with Amy at Pere Lachaise cemetery (and no doubt to the horror of Doors fans specifically on Jim Morrison’s grave). Later we descend into the labyrinthian catacombs of the capital’s underground.

Disappointingly Waller also eschews the sucker punch that had 1981 audiences leaving the cinema shell-shocked for a much happier ending. Whereas An American Werewolf in London concluded with its lupine antihero dying in his lover’s arms its follow-up concludes with Andy and Sérafine — both presumably cured — getting hitched atop the Statue of Liberty.

The drastic change in tone and the lack of any real ties to its predecessor means the movie is only a sequel in name. Even this brand recognition couldn’t tempt many to their nearest multiplex: Paris entered the domestic box office chart at a lowly seven grossing only $2.3 million more than notorious flop Mr. Magoo. Landis twisted the knife when he remarked “I was really disappointed when I saw that film I thought it was lousy.”

Lousy is a little too harsh for a film that occasionally shows flickers of the original’s lunar lunacy. But it undoubtedly tainted a genre classic which despite a much earlier inception still feels more evolved.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3RlbGVjb20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RlbGVjb20taW5mcmFzdHJ1Y3R1cmUtZmlybXMtc2Vlay1ycy0xODAwMC1jcm9yZS1pbnB1dC10YXgtY3JlZGl0LXJlZnVuZC85NjUxNzc5NNIBhwFodHRwczovL3RlbGVjb20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy90ZWxlY29tLWluZnJhc3RydWN0dXJlLWZpcm1zLXNlZWstcnMtMTgwMDAtY3JvcmUtaW5wdXQtdGF4LWNyZWRpdC1yZWZ1bmQvOTY1MTc3OTQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Telecom infrastructure firms seek Rs 18000-crore input tax credit refund,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/telecom-infrastructure-firms-seek-rs-18000-crore-input-tax-credit-refund/96517794 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021226EAD450>, 'Connection to telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com timed out.

(WSAZ) - For decades people in McDowell County West Virginia have not had access to clean drinking water due to outdated infrastructure.

In December 2022 the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in Washington D.C. Michael Regan toured the county to talk about clean water and funding to improve the system.

What many take for granted is hard to come by in McDowell County. “It’s 2022 and this is still happening” said Tori Satow a McDowell County resident. About two-thirds of the people in the county do not have access to clean drinking water.

“I feel like people that live here they’ve kind of learned to accept it like ‘yeah we don’t have running water whatever’ like hello people this is crazy. This is insane” said Tori Satow. Satow lives in the town of Keystone. The town has been under a boil water advisory for ten years. “Most mornings you wouldn’t know when you woke up if you were going to have water in the sink or not. We’d go weeks sometimes without running water” continued Satow.

A coal company built the original water system and after the company left the area no one took control and the lines deteriorated.

“Your kid is filthy your dishes are piled up everything is dirty. It’s so much more than that. When you can’t wash your dishes you can’t bathe your kid you can’t do anything. You get set in this mindset of why bother do anything and you’re just sitting with all this filth around you” said Satow.

The McDowell County Public Service District was created in 1990 and has spent the last few decades trying to consolidate and upgrade drinking water systems in the coal communities. The PSD started with 520 customers and now has up to 3500 customers.

“You can’t get funding for all of them at one time so you just have to take it a piece at a time so that’s what we’re doing we’re trying to work together one section at a time to make things happen in the county” said Mavis Brewster McDowell Public Service District General Manager.

The water treatment plant in the Kimball area is 120 years old. It is still in operation today. The plant provides about 300 customers with drinking water but it’s in bad shape.

“As you can see the roof the built-in shower back there. We’ve got these propped. I’d say that pump right there is somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 years old. It’s obsolete also so whenever it decides to fail we can’t get another pump like it” said Randy Whittaker PSD field supervisor.

A several-phase project is in the works to close out-of-date plants but the projects take time and money.

“Phase four of this Elkhorn project will take four old systems just like the Kimball out of service and will be served by a new plant. If you did all four phases of the Elkhorn project coming down Route 52 it’s going to be about $30 million” said Brewster.

With every grant and every project they connect more customers but each time water lines stop short of those in need.

“People call me and say you stopped just a mile before my house but we went as far as the funding allowed us to go. That has to be another phase of a project” said Brewster.

When the head of the EPA visited McDowell County he spoke to those trying to find solutions.

“Every person in this country deserves access to clean drinking water. Our coal communities were our communities that during the industrial revolution helped keep this country as competitive as it could be. Now they need federal assistance and a strong partnership. We’re here to provide that partnership” said Michael Regan EPA Administrator.

Regan vowed to help the county and connect every person with clean drinking water saying “We have historic resources. It’s important we get these resources to the right communities and communities like McDowell County deserve these resources.”

The EPA Administrator said that West Virginia is set to receive $83 million for infrastructure improvements. At this time it is unclear how much will go to McDowell County.

A deadly arctic blast that whipped through the United States starting last week has left the country’s Deep South region grappling with the scourge of burst pipes threatening leaks that could spill millions of litres of water.

The situation has left residents of cities such as Jackson Mississippi — long troubled by a water crisis — boiling water over the Christmas holiday and into Monday.

In the US South where long stretches of freezing temperatures are rarer than in other parts of the country water pipes are more likely to be found in uninsulated areas.

And with temperatures throughout the region hovering at or below 0C (32F) since Friday the water in some of those pipes has frozen and expanded creating pressure that causes leaks and bursts.

Dozens of cities in the region issued boil-water advisories or warned of bigger catastrophes if leaks from the broken pipes were not found and the water shut off.

“It’s death by a thousand cuts” Mike Saia a water system spokesperson for the city of Charleston South Carolina told WCSC-TV.

Charleston experienced near-record low temperatures on Christmas Eve with the wind chill making the air feel even colder. Over the holiday weekend the Charleston Water System reported an output of about 380 million litres (100 million gallons) — up from 190 million litres (50 million gallons) on a typical winter day.

Officials believe the increase is due to leaks with more than 400 water customers reporting burst pipes and many more spills suspected in empty offices homes and other buildings left vacant during the holidays.

Broken pipes can cause the water system to lose pressure and repaired pipes must be disinfected before they can return to use. Officials in Charleston warned of the possibility of a boil-water notice a rare event in the city.

The chilly weather exacerbated an existing water crisis in Jackson Mississippi the state’s capital and most populous city. On Christmas Day loss of water pressure led to a citywide boil-water advisory that has yet to be lifted.

“Please check your businesses and churches for leaks and broken pipes as these add up tremendously and only worsen the problem” the city said in a statement adding: “We understand the timing is terrible.”

In the days leading up to the freeze the US Congress passed a $1.7 trillion spending bill that allocated $600m to repairing the city’s battered water supply. That is in addition to $35.6m from the state under the American Rescue Plan Act offered on the condition that the city matches the funds.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba has estimated the repairs will require $1bn or more.

The city where more than 82 percent of residents are Black and a quarter live in poverty has experienced chronic water problems for years including lead contamination and sewage overflow into the nearby Pearl River. A previous freeze in February 2021 left tens of thousands without running water.

But in July the state put Jackson residents under a boil-water advisory after officials noted “higher than standard levels” of cloudiness in the water supply. The city linked the cloudiness to an “increased chance that water may contain disease-causing organisms” responsible for nausea and diarrhoea.

Then in August heavy rainfall led to flooding on the Pearl River causing residents to lose water pressure. Without running water many were forced to line up at distribution sites in order to get water for their daily needs such as drinking cooking bathing and flushing toilets.

Even after water pressure was restored the city — home to nearly 150000 residents — remained under a boil-water advisory until mid-September.

On Friday the National Weather Service in Jackson warned of the extreme cold writing on Twitter that the city had tied a 1963 record for the second-coldest temperature in its history at -4C (25F).

Lumumba the mayor also had called the water distribution system a “huge vulnerability” going into the cold snap. “We are going to prepare for the worst but pray for the best” he said in a statement last week.

Elsewhere across the region some residents in Shreveport Louisiana are also without water.

And in Selma Alabama Mayor James Perkins Jr warned on Facebook that if the leaks were not isolated “there is a real possibility that we will run out of water”. He declared a local state of emergency though the city officials later reported the water system had stabilised.

Workers meanwhile in the Harvest Hope food bank in Greenville South Carolina opened their doors on Monday morning to find broken pipes were spraying water across the facility.

“As soon as we opened the doors we were met by a literal tidal wave” spokesperson Chad Scott told local news station WYFF.

The food bank one of the state’s largest had to turn away people to respond to the situation with officials estimating that more than $1m in food could be lost.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rc2RrLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvd2F0ZXItbWFpbi1icmVha3MtdGVtcG9yYXJpbHktY2xvc2VzLXJvYWRzLWNsYXl0b24vNjMtMjk4NDk3YjgtZTIzMi00NWQ3LTlhODctMzJjMmRjZTgyMDQ00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Water main break in Clayton leaves road closed,"South Hanley Road is closed between Maryland and Bonhomme avenues as contractors repair asphalt damaged by the main break.

CLAYTON Missouri — Crews are working on a break on a 20-inch water main which temporarily closed South Hanley Road in Clayton.

The break happened between Bonhomme Avenue and Forsyth Boulevard.

Southbound lanes between Maryland and Bonhomme avenues were closed at about 3 p.m. Monday and will remain closed until repairs are made. Northbound traffic reopened Monday afternoon according to the Clayton Police Department.

Christie Barnhart with Missouri American Water said this break should not be affecting residents' water service.

Repairs will take some time due to the number of utility locates crews need to do Barnhart said. Crews will have to wait for warmer weather in order to make repairs to the asphalt that was damaged by the break.

The section of roadway was still closed as of Tuesday morning."

The 2022 ESG Excellence Award Ceremony is guided by the Information Office of Shanghai Municipality and Shanghai United Media Group and organized by Shanghai Daily. It acknowledges best practices in terms of ""Environment Society and Governance (ESG).""

""The recognition is a testament to Amgen's relentless endeavors in executing the ESG framework and unswerving commitment to the China market"" said Irene Hsu vice president and general manager of Amgen China.

Amgen entered China in 2012 committed to use science and biotechnology to improve the health of Chinese patients and societies and has identified chronic diseases as a key area for its ESG efforts in healthy aging.

In China chronic diseases are the primary cause of disability among senior citizens seriously affecting their health and wellbeing while also causing a heavy financial burden both to their families and society. Between 500 and 600 million patients suffer from chronic diseases accounting for approximately 88.5 percent of the death toll from illness in China in 2019.

""Our efforts are grounded in our mission of serving patients from harnessing our advanced biopharmaceutical expertise to address the increasingly unmet medical needs caused by the aging population to collaborating with local partners to optimize the chronic diseases' prevention and treatment pathway and build a sustainable healthcare ecosystem thus supporting the realization of 'Healthy China' vision"" Hsu noted.

Beyond accelerating business growth and expanding the reach of well-suited to more patients Amgen is committed to leading the shift from the current ""Break & Fix"" healthcare ecosystem to ""Predict & Prevent"" to better address budding issues and lower the chronic disease burden in line with Healthy China blueprint.

Supported by Amgen the Construction and Empirical Study of High-Quality and Efficient Health Service System of Aging Era (Phase II) also known as the Integrated Project of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and Treatment was launched in August of this year.

Under the guidance of the China National Health Development Research Center and the China Cardiovascular Association the project aims to identify cardiovascular disease high-risk patients from primary care health platforms constructed by the government and refer them to hospital's chest pain center for standardized treatment and follow-up care.

In the cardiovascular disease field specifically Amgen also supported opening the Chinese ASCVD (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) Prevention and Control Center in July 2019 to help reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients through preventative measures.

In March 2021 it was upgraded to the ACS (acute coronary syndrome) follow-up program establishing ACS follow-up protocols to enhance compliance after PCIs (percutaneous coronary interventions). The program covered 50 central hospitals and screened nearly 50000 patients by 2022 expecting to benefit more in the long run.

In the bone health field Amgen has been partnering with the Institute of Science and Technology of the National Health Commission and the Chinese Society of Osteoporosis and Bone Mineral Research on the Power Bone Program to establish and optimize a localized and standardized osteoporosis management care pathway by involving various disciplines at primary and first-class hospitals. To date nearly 90 medical centers and more than 11000 patients have benefited.

A disease status educational forum on osteoporosis was recently held at Amgen's booth at the fifth China International Import Expo as part of the efforts by Joyful Bone Program co-launched by Amgen and the China Women's Development Foundation to raise public awareness of osteoporosis prevention in elderly women. By now the Program has equipped over 8.4 million Chinese women and their families with osteoporosis disease knowledge.

Looking ahead with all the ongoing CSR programs Amgen will continuously work with all stakeholders to accelerate the Healthy China initiative by leveraging its ESG strategic framework of Healthy People Healthy Society Healthy Planet and a Healthy Amgen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vaXB3YXRjaGRvZy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8yNi9rZXktdXMtc3VwcmVtZS1jb3VydC1kZXZlbG9wbWVudHMtMjAyMi1vdXRsb29rLTIwMjMvaWQ9MTU0MDUyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Key U.S. Supreme Court Developments in 2022 and Outlook for 2023,"“Although the denials of Juno and Biogen were certainly disappointing practitioners and patent holders may be glad to have the Court grant certiorari on at least one half of the disclosure requirements in Section 112(a) by way of Amgen.”

It’s that time again. As 2022 has come and (almost) gone it’s time to look back at the exciting grants and surprising denials of certiorari petitions involving patent and trademark matters by the Supreme Court of the United States and what to look forward to from the Court in 2023.

Exciting Grants

In 2022 the Supreme Court docket was relatively light on intellectual property matters. After numerous denials of some highly anticipated patent and trademark cases the Court kept us in suspense by granting certiorari in new cases in November 2022.

The Court granted the certiorari petition in Amgen Inc. Petitioner v. Sanofi on November 4 2022. The question granted for the Court’s review is “Whether enablement is governed by the statutory requirement that the specification teach those skilled in the art to ‘make and use’ the claimed invention 35 U.S.C. §112 or whether it must instead enable those skilled in the art ‘to reach the full scope of claimed embodiments’ without undue experimentation—i.e. to cumulatively identify and make all or nearly all embodiments of the invention without substantial ‘time and effort’.” The technology at issue involves a pair of patents directed to an isolated monoclonal antibody owned by Amgen. The Federal Circuit found the language in the claims lacked enablement (e.g. claim 1 recites: “An isolated monoclonal antibody wherein when bound to PCSK9 the monoclonal antibody binds to at least one of the following residues: … and wherein the monoclonal antibody blocks binding of PCSK9 to LDLR.”). The Federal Circuit’s reasoning was that enablement for claims that recite functional limitations requires the consideration of the amount of experimentation required to make and use the full scope of the claimed invention.

The Solicitor General briefed the government’s position to the Court recommending that the Court not grant certiorari in this case. Surprising many the Court opted to grant the petition despite the Solicitor General’s recommendation. Ultimately the Court will need to strike a balance between giving patent holders the flexibility in their claim language to avoid minor modifications by a potential infringer while also not giving the patent holder broad claim scope that would impede future innovation.

The Court also granted certiorari in Abitron Austria GmbH Petitioner v. Hetronic International Inc. on November 4 2022. The question presented to the Court is whether the court of appeals erred in applying the Lanham Act extraterritorially to Abitron’s foreign sales in foreign countries by foreign sellers to foreign customers for use in foreign countries that never reached the U.S. or confused U.S. consumers. At the circuit court level the Lanham Act was held to apply extraterritorially whenever a foreign defendants’ conduct abroad effectively diverts foreign sales from a U.S. plaintiff based on the rationale that reducing foreign sales and revenue affects U.S. commerce. Notably the Solicitor General’s brief encouraged the Court to grant certiorari of this petition.

Jack Daniel’s petition for certiorari was also granted in Jack Daniel’s Properties Inc. Petitioner v. VIP Products LLC on November 21 2022. VIP Products sells dog toys that resemble the square-shape of a Jack Daniels Old No. 7 whiskey bottle; however instead of “Jack Daniels” the bottle-shaped dog toy reads “Bad Spaniels”. The lower court found that VIP’s dog toys would likely confuse consumers infringed Jack Daniel’s marks and tarnished Jack Daniel’s reputation. This was reversed at the circuit court which held that VIP had a First Amendment interest in using the Jack Daniel’s marks on their dog toys and rendered the dog toy products “noncommercial” and exempt from dilution-by-tarnishment claims. The Court granted Jack Daniel’s certiorari petition on two questions: (1) Whether humorous use of another’s trademark as one’s own on a commercial product is subject to the Lanham Act’s traditional likelihood-of-confusion analysis or instead receives heightened First Amendment protection from trademark-infringement claims; and (2) Whether humorous use of another’s mark as one’s own on a commercial product is “noncommercial” under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(3)(C) thus barring as a matter of law a claim of dilution by tarnishment under the Trademark Dilution Revision Act.

Surprising Denials

Although this year was filled with numerous requests for Supreme Court review of challenging issues facing intellectual property as usual the Court met those requests with denials of certiorari. Perhaps the biggest letdown of the year was the denial of review in American Axle & Manufacturing Inc. Petitioner v. Neapco Holdings LLC et al. on June 30 2022. This case was the latest in a long line of attempts to have the Court reframe patent eligibility under 35 U.S.C. § 101. Even the Solicitor General recommended granting the petition at least regarding the question of whether claiming a process for manufacturing an automobile driveshaft that simultaneously reduces two types of driveshaft vibration is patent-eligible under 35 U.S.C. § 101. Unfortunately for many holding out hope that the Court would provide clarity on subject matter eligibility the Court went against the Solicitor General’s recommendation and denied certiorari.

Another surprising denial was Juno Therapeutics Inc. et al. v. Kite Pharma Inc. on November 7 2022. The central issue in Juno was whether the written description requirement under 35 U.S.C. § 112(a) requires an inventor to demonstrate possession of the full scope of the claimed invention including all “known and unknown” variations of each component of the invention. The subject matter of the patent is single-chain antibody variable fragments which is a technology area jammed with issues of enablement and written description. Juno particularly highlights the issues with attempts to claim antibody binding elements based on their functional properties rather than by their structural features.

However Juno did not stop there. Juno filed a request for rehearing on November 23 2022 requesting that the Court grant rehearing of its order denying the petition for certiorari vacate that order and hold their case in abeyance pending the resolution of Amgen because the questions in both cases arise from the same statutory limitation in Section 112(a).

A challenge to Section 112(a) was also the main question in Biogen International GmbH et al. v. Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. in which certiorari was denied earlier this year. However in Biogen the main issue focused on written description and whether the requirement for written description is satisfied when “specification describes the invention or must the specification also disclose data that demonstrates the claimed invention is ‘effective’ and emphasize the claimed invention by singling it out and describing it more than once.” Thus Biogen was distinguished from Amgen and Juno in questioning different aspects of Section 112(a).

Although the denials of Juno and Biogen were certainly disappointing practitioners and patent holders may be glad to have the Court grant certiorari on at least one half of the disclosure requirements in Section 112(a) by way of Amgen.

Looking Forward to 2023

The Court has requested the comments of the Solicitor General in several pending petitions including Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. v. GlaxoSmithKline LLC et al.; Interactive Wearables LLC v. Polar Electro Oy et al.;and Tropp v. Travel Sentry Inc.

Notably the Solicitor General will be briefing the Court in Teva on the government’s stance on the use of section VIII statements accompanying an Abbreviated New Drug Application (known as a “skinny label”) as a way to avoid infringement of a method patent. The decision for GSK by the Federal Circuit has already had rippling effects. Prior to this decision drug product marketed under a skinny label would be found to not infringe a patented treatment method exempted from the label. In this case GSK which owns Coreg (carvedilol) sued Teva for their marketing of a generic version of carvedilol under a “skinny label” listing hypertension and left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction (post-MI LVD) as indications. The Orange Book listing for Coreg included “decreasing mortality caused by congestive heart failure”. GSK successfully argued that Teva’s inclusion of treating post-MI LVD on their “skinny label” would induce infringement their claims to “a method of decreasing mortality caused by congestive heart failure” based on expert testimony that congestive heart failure and post-MI LVD are “intertwined”. The purpose of the skinny label is to provide an avenue for more timely entrance of generic drugs to the market. The future of the skinny label hangs in the balance while the Court awaits the Solicitor General’s comments.

Lastly another interesting case that will likely seek review of the Court is Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation v. HEC Pharm Co. LTD. In this case the Federal Circuit reversed its previous ruling for Novartis now finding that Novartis’s Gilenya patents lacked written description support for a negative limitation in the claims. This was also a procedurally unique case because panel of the earlier January 2022 decision consisted of Judge O’Malley (writing for the majority) Judge Linn and Chief Judge Moore (dissenting). Upon Judge O’Malley’s subsequent retirement and replacement on the panel by Judge Hughes HEC requested a rehearing. Judge Hughes agreed with Chief Judge Moore to order a rehearing which resulted in a reversal with Chief Judge Moore now writing the majority opinion with Judge Linn as the dissent.

Novartis filed a request for a stay of the Federal Circuit decision while their certiorari petition was being prepared. The Court granted a temporary stay but ultimately the request for a stay was denied on October 13 2022. It is likely that Novartis will file a certiorari petition requesting review of the unusual Federal Circuit decision in early 2023.

And I’m here to tell you with a straight face that this best-of-both-worlds solution has no downsides. If you’re into watches and tech or even remotely watch-curious you should consider doing the same.

It’s easy to be a little bit anachronistic admiring the simplicities of the past while wanting the bleeding-edge intricacies of the future. I find myself bouncing back and forth on these all of the time. I want the latest technology in my digital camera but part of me feels an itch to go back to shooting film. I like the convenience of streaming music on Spotify but I spend money on vinyl records to own a proper sonic keepsake. The same is the case for my love of wristwatches. For years I’ve admired traditional watches fancy handmade mechanicals and inexpensive quartz movements alike but I’m still drawn to smartwatches and all of the functional advantages they offer.

A silver or black Apple Watch can match with just about anything even a bright red see-through Casio G-Shock.

My traditional watch collection is quite modest as I’m more the Casio and Seiko type than the Rolex and Omega type. In other words while I appreciate the luxury stuff out there I seek out affordable timepieces that are still fairly well made and designed and should last a long time if well taken care of. On the other hand I also own an Apple Watch Series 6 that I bought off of my colleague Mitchell Clark shortly after I started at The Verge. While the horological folks out there might categorize most styles of watches I own as “sport” or “tool” watches there really is nothing more sporting or tool-equipped than an Apple Watch. It’s a helpful little computer for your wrist though frankly it doesn’t get me excited quite like my Seiko SKX013 — which was my first automatic watch — or spark emotion in me like my dad’s old Hamilton Paxton that he left behind.

If I don’t get an occasional pop of color from my watches then the yellow stitches on my Docs have to do all the heavy lifting.

The Apple Watch is a great work of technology and engineering but its masterstroke comes from all of the stuff you can do with it: timers alarms notifications activity and fitness tracking and digital watchfaces you can change on the fly. Traditional watches have some of those features like timers and alarms but I don’t feel like I have to do much extra with a regular watch to appreciate their form and function.

Shapes sizes textures and materials are much more varied with traditional watches

Once I combined these two devices by wearing them at the same time every day I quickly learned how perfectly they complement each other. It starts out as simply as how I’m going to dress for the day. I often swap out which traditional watch I’m using every few days or even on a daily basis depending on my mood or what I’m wearing. Sometimes I want something that blends in with my outfit (which is usually black some gray and occasionally white) and sometimes I want my watch to be a statement piece that really pops from my monochromatic wardrobe. You can sort of do that with an Apple Watch on its own since there is a litany of strap options and watchfaces available but it’s not the same as traditional watches that have wholly different shapes sizes textures and materials from one to another.

With unique watches like this all-metal G-Shock you get cool features like a solar-powered movement that you just don’t get with most smartwatches. So why not wear and appreciate both?

However by combining the unique qualities of my traditional watch opposite my Apple Watch I feel like I can come up with small ensembles that lend me a bit of added confidence in my personal style and leave me feeling more comfortable in my own skin.

Now you may ask: is that the clothes or is it the watches? I’d argue it’s both. Each of my traditional timepieces has a small connection to me in terms of design and style so if I didn’t wear a watch or only stuck with a smartwatch I’d lose out on that little bit of personal flair.

This is my first main pitch to you for why I think more people should try out this double-wrist combination — accessorizing is just a whole lot of fun. Finding your personal style is essential to a lot of people’s confidence and overcoming personal anxieties and even if it helps a tiny bit it’s worth it. The other primary reason why you should try double-wristing is that it teaches you to settle into appreciating the things you’re into in a slightly more casual manner.

Okay I know I own a lot of G-Shocks. They’re affordable and so dang fun.

For example all of us that wear Apple Watches or other smartwatches are often familiar with battery anxiety. My 44mm Series 6 dies in about a day and a half but it rarely phases me. It’s barely a minor inconvenience because while it’s charging I’ve still got my regular watch on the opposite wrist. In fact I rarely ever charge my Apple Watch overnight which is the usual routine for many people. I let it track my sleep — because why not — and just plop it on the charger at any point in the day when it buzzes about a low battery. This practice may sound chaotic to some but to me it helps me mostly not care too much about the battery life of one more device in my life. If it dies it dies. I’ll get to charging it soon enough and have no problem being a bit blasé about it.

Accessorizing is just a whole lot of fun

These casual feelings have also helped me not get too bent out of shape over the inevitable dents and dings my watches pick up. In fact when I bought my Apple Watch from Mitchell I was aware that it already had led a very Pacific Northwest life — it had a bunch of small scuffs and a long scratch across its screen which I assume happened while running away from a bear trying to steal Mitchell’s fancy trail mix or something. Buying a well-loved timepiece for a good deal is a great way to help you overcome that initial anxiety of putting the first scratch on it and since my wrists have a tendency to make unscheduled appointments with the door frames in my house it’s just best that I don’t fret. Patina and wear and tear are cool anyway right?

Watches are important keepsakes for a reason. My father’s old manual-wind Hamilton still works like a charm and when I wore it on my wedding day it was a small way of making him a part of it. I usually reserve it for special occasions.

Keeping my relationships casual with my timepieces (and any device I own really) is often best as I have a tendency to be a little too hardcore about some of the things I care about most. When someone asks me about my cameras or my fountain pens or my love of Dr. Martens boots I have a tendency to come on a little strong and overshare my passion for these things — I’m working on that. But that brings me to what may be my most important point about the double wristwatch ensemble: you think you’ll look like a weird nerd but the truth is most people do not care. Not one iota. Like nobody else gives a shit. Trust me.

Most people don’t give a shit about your expensive camera either by the way unless they’re just as big of a nerd as you. Ditto for wearing two watches.

Just like when you go out looking your best and nobody comments on how cool or pretty or handsome you look that day if you’re doing this for other people you’re doing it wrong. You have to do it all for yourself because that’s the opinion that matters most. You’ll think wearing two watches will paint you as some weirdo but even if and when people actually notice enough to make a comment it’s so low on their list of concerns that they probably won’t give it much more thought or attention after that. You can give them a long explanation sort of like I’m doing here as to all the advantages of wearing two watches but most conversations will play out like this:

“Oh are you wearing two watches?”

“Yeah a regular watch and a smartwatch.”

“Why?”

“I like it.”

“Oh okay cool.”

And whether they think it’s actually cool doesn’t really matter. It matters that you think it’s cool or that you like the way it makes you feel about yourself or that you like being able to tell the time with a small flick of either wrist because it’s helpful when you’re working on something and you’ve got your hands full but you gotta know the time because someone’s asking or... — I digress.

On the off chance that someone asks you about your duo of watches and they actually do care it’s probably because they’re into this stuff too and it will instead spark a beautifully nerdy conversation about watches or tech or both. In my experience this is more likely than any snide remarks or perplexed stares of confusion.

The Casio F91W may be my most inexpensive watch but that doesn’t stop me from cherishing it like few others — even opposite a pricey Apple Watch.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNDY3LTAyMi0zNTIxNi0y0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Physical deep learning with biologically inspired training method: gradient-free approach for physical hardware,"Direct feedback alignment and its augmentation for physical deep learning

Fig. 1a shows the basic concept of PNNs. The forward propagation of a standard multilayer network is described as \({x}^{\left(l+1\right)}=f\left({a}^{\left(l\right)}\right)\) where \({a}^{\left(l\right)}={W}^{\left(l\right)}{x}^{\left(l\right)}\) with the weight \({W}^{\left(l\right)}\epsilon {\mathbb{R}}^{{N}^{(l+1)}\times {N}^{(l)}}\) and input \({x}^{\left(l\right)}\epsilon {\mathbb{R}}^{{N}^{(l)}}\) for the lth layer and f denotes an element-wise nonlinear activation. In the PNN framework this operation is executed on a physical system; i.e. x(l) W(l) and f correspond to the physical inputs (e.g. optical intensity electric voltage vibration) physical interconnections (e.g. optical electrical or mechanical coupling) in the physical system and physical nonlinearity (e.g. nonlinear optical/magnetic/mechanical effects) respectively. To train such networks we need to update W(l) to reduce given cost function E. A general solution is the BP algorithm shown in Fig. 1b. The gradients for BP are obtained through the chain-rule as follows:

$${e}^{(l)}=\left[{W}^{\left(l+1\right)T}{e}^{\left(l+1\right)}\right]\odot {f^{\prime}}({a}^{(l)})$$ (1)

where \({e}^{\left(l\right)}\epsilon {\mathbb{R}}^{{N}^{(l+1)}}\) is the error signal at the lth layer defined as \({e}^{(l)}=\partial E/\partial {a}^{(l)}\) with \({a}^{(l)}={W}^{(l)}{x}^{(l)}\) the superscript T denotes transposition and ⊙ denotes the Hadamard product. From Eq. (1) we can compute the gradient for each W(l) as \(\delta {W}^{(l)}=-{e}^{(l)}{x}^{\left(l\right)T}\). The training using Eq. (1) is typically executed on a regular external computer by constructing a physical simulation model1416303944 which incurs large computational cost. Thus this strategy is not suitable for in-situ training. In addition the error in the simulation model significantly affects PNN performance. Therefore the training method for PNNs is still under consideration despite the success of BP in software-based ANNs.

Fig. 1: Concept of PNN and its training by BP and augmented DFA. a Schematics of physical neural networks (PNNs). Training sequence of PNN with b BP and c augmented biologically plausible training called direct feedback alignment (DFA). Augmented DFA enables parallel scalable and physically accelerable training of deep physical networks based on random projection with alternative nonlinearity g(a). Full size image

Let us consider DFA as an alternative solution [see Fig. 1c]. In the standard DFA framework the weighted gradient signals in Eq. (1) are replaced with a linear random projection of the error signal at the final layer L5354. Then we can obtain the following update rule:

$${e}^{(l)}=\left[{B}^{\left(l\right)}{e}^{\left(L\right)}\right]\odot {f^{\prime}}\big({a}^{(l)}\big)$$ (2)

where \({B}^{\left(l\right)}\epsilon {\mathbb{R}}^{{N}^{(l+1)}\times {N}^{(y)}}\) is a random projection matrix for the lth layer update and f’ denotes the gradient of f. As shown in Eq. (2) we can estimate the gradient without information about W (l). In addition physical implementation of random projection process \({B}^{\left(l\right)}{e}^{\left(L\right)}\) can be implemented by using various devices because this process is the same as in the physical ELM and RC approach. By using commercially available photonic components we can emulate 5 × 105 by 5 × 105 matrix operations on a single integrated optics57 which are enough for the single hidden layer even in the state-of-the-art model. Note that in this hypothesis we assumed a liquid-crystal-on-silicon (LCOS) spatial-light modulator (SLM) for the input encoding and a passive optical diffuser for the random matrix. Thus the input vector (e(L) for the DFA processing) is reconfigurable but the random matrix (B(l) for the DFA processing) is not. By using an additional SLM instead of the random scattering medium we can implement programmable random matrices3458. The limitations due to such a photonic implementation are discussed in Supplementary Information S.9. Also the photonic acceleration of this process has already been demonstrated59. In addition the DFA process can be parallelized because it is not a sequential equation unlike the one for BP. Despite its simplicity DFA can scale modern neural network models (see Supplementary Information S1 and ref. 54). However f’(a) remains in Eq. (2) requiring accurate modeling and simulations which is the bottleneck in the learning process for PNNs.

Here we replace the f’(a) function with the function g(a) to investigate the robustness against the choice of g(a). Then we derive the update rule as

$${e}^{(l)}=\left[{B}^{\left(l\right)}{e}^{\left(L\right)}\right]\odot g\big({a}^{(l)}\big)$$ (3)

As f’(a) is replaced with g(a) the equation no longer includes the knowledge for the parameters in the forward propagation. The gradient δW(l) can be estimated from the final error e(l) and alternative nonlinear projection of given a(l). Thus we no longer require the gradient of the original networks which is highly advantageous for PNN training. As shown in the following section we can select a broader range of g(a). The only requirement is to avoid the function uncorrelated to f’(a). Notably the computation of g(a) can also be implementable to a physical system. A concrete example is shown in the Physical Implementation section below. We named this algorithm as augmented DFA.

Interestingly the augmented DFA is also useful for black-box fixed physical networks such as a physical RC where black-box means that we do not know (or only have rough information about) W(l) and f. When we apply the BP algorithm to physical RC we need to simulate the gradient of the physical system using a regular computer. Thus we need to open the black-box (need to measure and approximate W(l) and f) to estimate the gradients which spoils the advantage of such a randomly fixed physical network. On the other hand the augmented DFA can train a physical RC without the BP and knowledge about the physical system. Although the update rule of the augmented DFA for the RC requires additional computation compared with Eq. (3) [see Eqs. (6-11) in Methods] this can be executed on physical hardware in the same manner as forward propagation in an RC. Thus we can improve the performance of RC while maintaining its unique features. The detailed update rule for the RC is described in Methods and the concrete experimental demonstration is shown in the following section.

For the actual physical implementation using the augmented DFA it should be mentioned how a(l) is obtained from the PNNs for the computation of Eq. (3). For most feedforward-type PNNs the physical (or electrical) nonlinear layer and linear multiply-accumulate layer (e.g. the fully connected layer) are separated. Thus we can measure a(l) as an output of a physical network and we can use it as an input parameter for Eq. (3). On the other hand some physical networks cannot separate the nonlinear and linear layer. For example an RC includes nonlinearity in the physical dynamics itself. In this case we can directly obtain g(a(l)) by changing the nonlinearity in the physical system. A concrete example of the former (separated physical nonlinearity) and latter (physical nonlinearity included) cases are shown in Supplementary Information S2 and the Physical Implementation section below.

Basic characterization of augmented DFA

First we investigated the effect of the augmentation of DFA that is the effect of g(a). For this purpose we used the standard image classification benchmark called the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database (MNIST) task with a simple multilayer-perceptron (MLP) model. In the experiment the MLP model was composed of four fully connected layers with 800 nodes for each layer and two types of nonlinear activation f(a) namely a hyperbolic tangent (tanh) sine (sin) and cosine (cos) function. These nonlinearities correspond to a simple model of common photonic implementation. In this experiment we generated g(a) from some well-used functions (sine cos tanh triangle) and the random Fourier series \(g\left(a\right)={\sum }_{k=1}^{K}{p}_{k}{{\sin }}\left({ka}\pi \right)+{q}_{k}{{\cos }}(k{{{{{\rm{a}}}}}}\pi )\) where p k and q k  are the random uniform coefficients sampled from \({\mathbb{R}}\)∈[−1:1]. K was set to 4 and normalized by the relationship \(\mathop{\sum }

olimits_{k=1}^{K}{|p}_{k}\left |+{{|q}}_{k}\right |=1\). A hundred random Fourier series were examined in this experiment. Random matrix B(l) was generated from the uniform distribution.

The training curves for the augmented DFA and BP are shown in Fig. 2a. For comparison we also show the results for the BP algorithm in Eq. (1) with f’(a) replaced with g(a). Here the g(a) was generated from the various nonlinear activations and the random Fourier series with 100 random seeds. Thus correlation coefficient (corr) η between f’(a) and g(a) varied with the difference in the random seed and the choice of nonlinearity (see [Eq. (12)] in Methods for the definition). The solid line and the shaded area indicate the averaged test error for all the experiments and the region between the maximum and minimum values respectively. The color difference indicates the difference in the examined nonlinearity in the forward propagation f. As can be seen the average accuracy of the augmented DFA is far superior to that for BP when we replace the nonlinearity. The training curve of the augmented DFA seems to converge for the examined case while the one for the BP seems to often diverge. Figure 2c shows the test error as a function of η. The whiskers plots and filled area show the minimum and maximum values average values and density of data distribution respectively. The case for η = 1 means that g(a) equals f’(a) which corresponds to the case of the standard BP and DFA in Eqs. (1) and (2). The cases for η = 0 and −1 correspond to uncorrelation and negative correlation respectively. The test error of BP increases sharply when η deviates from 1. In particular almost no meaningful training was possible when the correlation coefficient was negative. This is because the update direction became opposite from the correct direction. On the other hand the test accuracy for the augmented DFA showed a gentle dependency on η. These results indicate that the training is highly robust to the choice of g(a). The test error for the augmented DFA was maximized at η = 0 [i.e. g(a) became the uncorrelated function of f’(a)]. Even in the worst case we were able to obtain an accuracy of about 89% which is far superior to that for BP. In addition learning can be performed when the correlation coefficient is negative. We think that this is due to the random weight matrix B; that is the randomly distributed linear projection term in Eq. (3) erases the positive/negative sign of g(a). Note that the observed convergence of the augmented DFA is not always guaranteed: e.g. we observed divergence of the training curve when f’(a) was a random Fourier series (see Supplementary Information S5). However the robustness against the choice of g(a) was much superior to that for BP in all examined cases.

Training curve of 4-layer MLP with 800 hidden nodes for a augmented DFA and b BP with various g(a):sin(a) cos(a) triangle(a) tanh(a) functions and 40 random Fourier series. Color differences indicate differences in activation function [ f(a)=sin(a) cos(a) tanh(a)]. Bold line and shaded area indicate the average and maximum-minimum region respectively. c Test error distribution of four-layer fully connected neural network as a function of the correlation coefficients between f ’(a) and g(a) η. Blue and red boxplots in c are the results for the model trained by BP and augmented DFA respectively. η was scanned by using various g(a):sin(a) cos(a) triangle(a) tanh(a) functions and a random Fourier series.

One index for evaluating whether the feedback alignment algorithm operates well or not is the alignment angle (∠δ BP/DFA ) which is the angle between δ BP and δ DFA  where δ BP  δ DFA  and ∠δ BP/DFA are defined as δ BP = WTe(l) and δ DFA = B(l)e(L) ∠δ BP/DFA =cos−1(δ BP ・δ DFA )52. When the alignment angle lies within 90° the network trained by the augmented DFA is roughly in the same direction as the BP would be. Here we analyzed the alignment angle of the network with four hidden layers (see Supplementary Information S11 for details). We found that the alignment angles for the BP are significantly increased when η is apart from one which reflects the test error increase shown in Fig. 2c. On the other hand the alignment angle for augmented DFA is highly robust to the η value and smaller than 90°. These results suggest that we can train the deep physical network using inaccurate f’(a) (or even using an alternative nonlinear function) which provides ease of physical implementation.

Let us discuss the effectiveness of the augmented DFA against a randomly fixed deep network606162 towards application to a physical RC. Before the experiment we investigated the applicability of DFA itself to such network using the deep RC and ELM models (see Supplementary Information S6 and S10). As in the analysis for the MLP case shown in Fig. 2a–c we investigated robustness against the choice of g(a) in the augmented DFA algorithm using the deep RC with four hidden layers. For this purpose f(a) and g(a) were set to cos(a) and sin(a+θ). The spectral radius of reservoir weight was set to 0.9 because the performance of the deep RC was maximized in this region (see Supplementary Information S13). By varying the θ value from 0 to π we could scan η from −1 to 1 easily. Figure 2d shows the test accuracy for the MNIST task as a function of η. For comparison we also plotted the results for the same network trained by BP by replacing f’(a) with g(a). As can be seen unlike for the BP training the accuracy of the RC trained by the augmented DFA is robust against the choice of g(a) which is the same trend as in the results for the MLP. The accuracy became worse when η approached zero and we should avoid this region to achieve better performance. These results basically support the effectiveness of the augmented DFA approach even in an RC. As shown in Supplementary Information S12 the robustness against η highly depends on the number of nodes. This suggests that the number of nodes is important not only for accuracy but also for robustness. The analysis of the alignment angle for this network is shown in Supplementary Information S11. In contrast to the MLP case we found that the alignment angle for η = 0 was larger than 90°. However even in the region beyond the alignment angle of 90° we were able to obtain an error of around 5%. We think that the network only trains the final layer weights in this case. In our experiment the multilayer network did not have nonlinear activation in the final layer as in the same manner for the standard RC. As the gradient in the final layer is the same as in the standard network the weight in the final layer is simply varied to minimize the final error even in the region with η = 0. In fact we were able to obtain an error of approximately ~6% in the readout-only training which supports our inference. The applications of the augmented DFA to other network models including an MLP-Mixer vision Transformer and ResNet deep-ELM are described in Supplementary Information S1 and S10.

Physical implementation

Here we show a concrete example of physical implementations of PNNs trained by the augmented DFA namely a prototype hardware/software implementation of an optoelectronic RC using an FPGA-assisted fiber-optic system. Numerical simulations of other physical implementations including a diffractive optical neural network and a nanophotonic neural network are described in Supplementary Information S2.

Up to now various physical implementations of single-layer RC have been achieved by using a delayed dynamical system with a single nonlinear device81718212223 By expanding this concept we implemented deep RC by cascading the delayed dynamical system. Figure 3a shows a schematic explanation of our constructed optoelectronic deep RC benchtop. The equilibrium network topology is shown in Fig. 3b. In this system temporal input signals of the lth layer x i (l)(n) are masked and converted to M i (l)x i (l)(n) using mask function M i (l) where i is the virtual node number (i = 1 2… N where N is the number of virtual nodes in each reservoir layer). This operation generates quasi-random connections between inputs and virtual nodes. The masked inputs are converted to optical signals using an optical intensity modulator with time interval θ rc . Thus the input signals are elongated to time interval T = Nθ rc . The signals are introduced into a delay ring with a single nonlinear system which acts as the reservoir layer. If we set the length of the delay ring τ as τ = T each node only couples with the previous state of itself [meaning Ω in Eq. (6) becomes diagonal matrix]. On the other hand by choosing τ = (N + k)θ rc  we can obtain a coupling between x i and x i−k  which provides richer dynamics18. Thus we set the delay time as the desynchronized condition τ = (N + 1)θ rc . The signals are directly detected by a single photodiode and their discretized dynamic responses are considered as virtual nodes. These signals are converted to digital signals which are stored in the memory. Then they are considered as the next layer input signal x i (l+1)(n). They are masked by M i (l+1) and re-input to the RC system. The rest of the processing scheme is the same as in the previous layer. Since this scheme shares all the hardware components the device architecture is simple cost-effective and easy to implement. Other possible photonic implementations of the deep RC are summarized in Supplementary Information S3.

Fig. 3: Optoelectronic deep RC system with augmented DFA training. a Schematic of the constructed optoelectronic deep RC. The input signals are masked by a digital processor and sent to the optoelectronic RC system to solve Eqs. (4) and (5). The change in the nonlinearity from f(a) to g(a) is realized by applying a bias to the Mach–Zehnder modulator. Based on physically solved x and s values the mask for each layer is updated. b Equilibrium network topology for the constructed optoelectronic RC. Each reservoir layer shows ring topology since the RC system is composed of a delay-based nonlinear fiber ring. Full size image

As a nonlinear device we employed a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZM) which provides the activation f(x) = cos(x+Φ bias ). Then the obtained virtual node response x i (l+1)(n) can be described as

$${x}_{i}^{\left(l\right)}(n)=\cos \left\{\alpha {x}_{i-1}^{\left(l\right)}\left(n-1\right)+{M}_{i}^{\left(l\right)}{x}_{i}^{\left(l-1\right)}\left(n\right)+{\varPhi }_{{bias}}\right\}$$ (4)

where α is feedback gain in the nonlinear delay ring. The operation in the next layer is the same as in the first layer. The outputs y(n) are obtained from weighted summation of final layer output x i (L)(n) the same as in Eq. (7) in Methods. Therefore this stacked architecture of nonlinear delay line-based oscillators can simply emulate a special type of deep RC. For the training we need to calculate Eqs. (8)–(11) in Methods. In particular Eq. (9) requires heavy computational costs because it includes recurrent computation with O(N2) operation with each time step the same as Eq. (6) in the forward propagation case. However in this system Eq. (9) can be solved by using the same optical system characterized by Eq. (4). By setting the bias as (φ bias + π/2) we can generate an alternative nonlinear activation as follows:

$${s}_{i}^{\left(l\right)}\left(n\right)=\sin \left\{{\alpha s}_{i-1}^{\left(l\right)}\left(n-1\right)+{M}_{i}^{\left(l\right)}{x}_{i}^{\left(l-1\right)}\left(n\right)+{\varphi }_{{bias}}\right\}.$$ (5)

By scanning the φ bias value we can sweep the η value from −1 to 1 to investigate the robustness against η. From digitally solved Eqs. (8) (10) and (11) and physically solved Eq. (9) shown in the Methods section we can train the inherent parameters \({M}_{i}^{\left(l\right)}\)and final readout ω. Note that we can solve Eq. (8) using additional optical hardware for optical random matrix operation (see Supplementary Information S9) and this approach might accelerate the computational speed further.

Based on the above proposals we constructed a deep optoelectronic RC by combining a high-speed optoelectronic system developed for optical telecom with a highly programmable field programmable gate array (FPGA) with fast digital-to-analog/analog-to-digital converters (DAC/ADC). We also developed Pytorch/Python-compatible middleware for ease of use of our device (see Supplementary Information S7). Using the benchtop we examined the standard benchmark tasks. Figure 4a shows the layer dependence of the test accuracy of the MNIST task (the details of the experimental setup are described in Methods; the image processing scheme using the deep RC is described in Supplementary Information S4). In this experiment we set to the virtual node number N = 404 α = 0.9 and φ bias to 0 [i.e. g(a) is equal to f’(a) ideally]. L = 0 means readout-only training; L = 1 means both readin and readout training. As can be seen the performance was improved by increasing the number of layers as expected from the simulation. This suggests the effectiveness of the augmented DFA algorithm for physical RCs. Figure 4b shows the experimentally obtained test error as a function of correlation coefficient η. Note that the achieved accuracy was slightly lower than that in Fig. 4a even for θ = 0 because we stopped the training at the tenth epoch in this experiment. For comparison the simulation results are also plotted. The robustness of the test error to the change in g(a) exceeded that expected from the simulation. We think that this is due to the inherent non-idealities of the device. In our device we changed the shape of function g by applying bias voltage to optoelectronic modulator [LiNbO 3 -based MZM (LN-MZM)]. In general this bias voltage drifts during RC operation because the phase shift in the MZM-arm drift due to changes in temperature and humidity or some external perturbations. We compensated for such a drift effect by measuring the LN-MZM outputs every 20 minutes. However we think that we were unable to eliminate this effect perfectly which would explain the fluctuation of η value in the training phase. This fluctuation smoothed out the steep dependency near the η = 0. We believe that this result is one of the useful examples of physical non-ideality for physical computing.

Blue and orange plots show the results for the constructed benchtop and simulation on a CPU.

The obtained test accuracy for MNIST Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10 are summarized in Table 1. The reported values for previous photonic DNN implementations and RC-based on other physical dynamics are also summarized in Table 1343563646566676869. As references the state-of-the-art results obtained with standard computers for these benchmarks are also shown in Table707172. Despite the simplicity of our delay-based hardware implementation we achieved performance competitively with the state-of-the-art large-scale benchtop for all the examined tasks. This supports the effectiveness of our approach.

Table 1 Performance comparison of PNNs for benchmark tasks Full size table

To evaluate the efficiency of our scheme we measured the computational time for training our system. Although previous studies also compared the processing time of PNNs they basically only evaluated the matrix operation time [e.g. \({x}^{(l+1)}=f({W}^{(l)}{x}^{(l)})\)]. However PNNs require many additional operations such as data transfer to the physical system training based on simulation models DAC/ADC operations and pre- and post-processing for physical processing. Thus the whole processing time was still under consideration. Owing to our constructed physically accelerable algorithm and its FPGA-assisted hardware implementation with full Pytorch/Python-compatible software we can evaluate the whole processing time of our device including the training time. As a first step we investigated the processing time of PNNs by changing the node count since the advantage of the physical RC approach lies in the acceleration to solve Eqs. (6) and (8) in the Methods section with O(N2) computational costs.

Figure 4c shows the measured training time per image for our constructed optoelectronic RC benchtop. For comparison we also show the results for the augmented DFA and BP training on a CPU (Intel Core i7-9700 8 cores 3.0-GHz clock) and GPU (Nvidia Quadro P5000 2560 cores 16GB memory). The same results with the log-log-scaled plot are shown in Fig. 4d. The budget of processing time for the RC benchtop is broken down as follows: FPGA processing (data-transfer memory allocation and DAC/ADC) of ~92%; digital processing of ~8% for pre/post-processing including the time for solving of Eqs. (7) (8) (10) and (11); and optoelectronic processing time of ~0.02% for solving Eqs. (6) and (8). Thus the processing time is dominated by the digital computation on the FPGA and CPU in the current stage. This is because our optoelectronic benchtop implements only a reservoir layer using a single nonlinear delay line; that is we need to transfer and measure the large-scale hidden state using a serial transmission line. These limitations can be relaxed by utilizing fully parallel and all-optical computation hardware in future73. As can be seen the computation on the CPU and GPU shows O(N2) trends against the node count whereas the benchtop shows O(N) which is due to the data-transfer bottleneck. (We need O(N) memory on the FPGA board but the memory size on the FPGA is limited. Thus we need to increase the number of data-transfers by reducing minibatch size which results in a linear time increment against N.) The physical acceleration beyond the CPU was observed at N ~5000 and ~12000 for the BP and augmented DFA algorithm respectively. However in terms of computation speed the effectiveness against the GPU has not been directly observed yet due to the memory limitation of the GPU. By extrapolating the GPU trend we think that we could observe physical acceleration beyond that of a GPU at N ~80000. These estimations are on the same order as a previous estimation on the forward propagation of a photonic RC57. To the best of our knowledge this is the first comparison of the whole training process and the first demonstration of physical training acceleration using PNNs.",,,,,,

With the world population topping eight billion for the first time ""Santa is flying faster than ever; we estimate he's traveling over Mach 7 this year""—seven times the speed of sound more than a mile per second—""to hit all those datapoints around the world in one night"" says Adam Gorski aerospace engineer for Exton Pennsylvania-based Ansys Government Initiatives.

AGI a flight-simulation subsidiary of Ansys Inc. is one of two Philadelphia-area tech companies that cooperate to track Santa Claus' Christmas Eve flights in real time using data collected by NORAD the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command.

NORAD collects data from transmitters in many places including a convenient Santa Claus sled beacon—""Rudolph's red nose"" Gorski added.

""Anything that fast is hypersonic—you see it long before you hear it. You need special technology to go that fast"" the kind that propels satellites into orbit but doesn't yet power commercial aircraft he added.

""Also magic reindeer. They go that fast.""

A sister company Center City-based Cesium builds the user-friendly dashboard software that makes Santa easier to track along with systems used by gamers and other participants in the emerging virtual-reality networks known as the metaverse.

Since the 1960s NORAD has tracked planes satellites and other flying objects over North America and made the data publicly available making it easier for flight planners to avoid accidents and improve air traffic safety.

There are Grinches who object. Twitter owner Elon Musk earlier this month suspended social media users including some journalists who provided similar information from public sources that tracked his and other billionaires' private jets around the world.

Musk said he had safety concerns that the data might be used by those who wish to harm him and other high-profile people; critics accused him of muzzling them and compromising his own promises to lessen restrictions on the circulation of information.

Despite Musk's cancellations NORAD and its Philly tech partners have continued to post their Santa Claus tracking data through the NoradSantaNews.com website (with links in a few languages) YouTube Pinterest LinkedIn—and also @NoradTracksSanta on Musk's Twitter network.

Ansys says the sites it services that provide Santa tracking information received more than 20 million visits last year and that traffic has risen each year.

Both Ansys' Exton unit—it was the private company Analytical Graphics Inc. before Pittsburgh-based military contractor Ansys bought for $700 million it in 2020—and Cesium were founded by engineer Paul Graziani and his colleagues who left what was then GE Aerospace in King of Prussia in 1990 to start a series of space technology businesses.

NORAD began tracking Santa in 1965 after a Colorado newspaper accidentally printed its headquarters' phone number in place of a department store's call-Santa line and NORAD volunteers began answering the resulting flood of calls. Ansys began aiding the effort 25 years ago; the business now known as Cesium signed on in 2012.

I asked Gorski about Musk's concern: Don't his company and NORAD worry all that information about Santa's location might be abused to compromise security? What if bad actors plot Santa's course and attempt to rob the sleigh or wreck the gift-giving operation?

""His only defense is reindeer antlers and the ability to move really fast"" Gorski acknowledged.

But Santa has many friends and able defenders watching out for him he concluded: ""NORAD reports that our Navy jets check on Santa tipping their wings as he goes past.""

Mr Allen Onyema the chairman/CEO of Air Peace Nigeria’s largest airline who is also the vice-president of the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) in this interview describes airline operators as some of the country’s most patriotic citizens offering services under a most excruciating condition which no foreign airline can cope with saying given the necessary support they can compete with any foreign carrier. Excerpt:

What is the state of the airline industry today with the multitude of challenges the operators have pointed out in recent times? Have the issues you raised been addressed?

If you are talking about foreign exchange (forex) those challenges are still there. It is very difficult to procure forex and when you see it it comes at a high cost and our ticket fare the only source of revenue for the airlines is in naira and remember all our operations are dollar-denominated except the catering that you bring onboard the aircraft. So it is a very huge challenge for the airlines in the country.

Then you talk about aviation fuel. When aviation fuel was N400 per litre we cried out. We never knew the thing could go to over N900 one day. So you can imagine the unit cost per seat on the aircraft when you look at the kind of aircraft Nigerian airlines use it is about N67000 to N68000 per unit cost that is we must not charge below that amount and anything below that amount you run into a problem. But you see airlines charging N50000 N40000 just to have some revenue but at the end of the day that is not sustainable at all. Something may give way. But it is happening.

On aviation fuel we have seen several interventions from the federal government House of Representatives and so on have we not been seeing the outcomes of some of these interventions?

Yes President Muhammadu Buhari came to our rescue by intervening in the aviation fuel crisis; making available a certain quantity of fuel to us not for free but at a controlled price instead of the market price. Though it is not steady and not enough but it is very helpful.

The permanent solution to the fuel issue is for Nigeria to refine its own aviation fuel. As long as we continue to import aviation fuel we will continue to have this problem. We have crude oil I don’t see the reason why Nigeria should be importing the by-products of crude oil.

To what extent has the forex issue affected the operations of airlines especially in terms of carrying out your scheduled maintenance?

You don’t know what we go through. Many of the foreign maintenance organisations sometimes threaten to sell off your planes sell off your engines because they don’t believe sometimes we have the naira but we don’t have the dollars. You don’t just go to the market and buy any dollar. If you buy cash you may not be able to transfer it. Many of us don’t want to go through third parties.

Because of this scarcity of foreign exchange Nigerian Airlines have been exposed so dangerously to outsiders wanting to cash in into the unfortunate situation to either dupe us or put us in trouble because some would come and tell you ‘I have $2m in Hong Kong’ they would give you a good rate and tell us who you want us to transfer to.

We don’t want to be involved in that kind of thing because we don’t know the sources of the funds. You don’t know if they are products of corruption drug business or terrorism. So it is very difficult.

So we all wait until we get legitimate funds through the Central Bank or through our banks and they don’t come that easy. And it is not the fault of CBN the Central Bank only disburses what it has; it has to do with our earning capacity. If we don’t have it we don’t have it and everybody has to understand.

It has been said that Nigerian airlines are not capable of competing with big international airlines. What would you say about this?

Nigerian airlines are very strong. Nigerian airlines have capacity. Nigerian airlines do what foreign airlines and others cannot do. Given the circumstances that we find ourselves in. If you bring the foreign airlines to come and operate in this country as indigenous airlines with all their money but are not going to be given any preferential treatment so they operate under the same circumstances as we operate operate under the circumstance where in the morning you don’t know if you have fuel to fuel your aircraft. You have a 6:30 flight and you are still looking for fuel at 8 o’clock and the vendors have said there is scarcity of aviation fuel. Even when you buy the price you buy in the morning may not be the same three hours later.

Let the foreign airlines come and face the circumstances we face in this country without being given preferential treatment. Let them come where they said your aircraft would be inspected and you have to wait. Let them come and stay in a terminal where over 2000 people would pass through one screening machine. Let them come and go to Abuja airport where 10 airlines are scrambling for a small space. Let them come and find themselves in that crowd where there are no conveyor belts and they have to carry their loads on their heads. Let them come and perform let us see.

Foreign airlines will never last more than 72 hours before they walk away. So let us give credit to the Nigerian airlines they are doing patriotic jobs for the country.

The truth is that Nigerian airlines have been so demonised by even people who are supposed to protect them and of course the flying public. If they knew the truth they would give kudos to these airlines.

You recently stated that 95 per cent of the causes of delays are not within the purview of airlines….

Yes of course I still say it and I stand by it. AON also stands by it. 95 per cent of the delays Nigerians experience flying domestic operations are caused by things beyond their control.

Let’s start with when you have your aircraft on the ground and you need to get a spare part to clear with the customs it might take you days weeks to get it out. There is another one called an end-user certificate. My aircraft was on the ground sometime for three months to get an end-user certificate because some parts of the aircraft are classified as dangerous goods. I am not exaggerating other airlines are facing the same thing.

Things like this deplete your capacity. Secondly you talk of airport infrastructure. I have told you what is happening in Abuja. Once your flight leaves on time from here to Abuja during that peak time in the morning all the airlines are camped into one small place which has no conveyor belt and you are given two counters each when Air Peace alone is doing 28 to 30 flights out of Abuja alone not to talk of other airlines.

Again most airports don’t have night landing facilities. So what you do in order not to cancel flights is you sacrifice Lagos Kano Port Harcourt or Abuja where you have night landing facilities. This is happening every day. Is that the fault of the airlines?

You also have the issue of bird strikes. Who is supposed to pursue the birds? Once you have a bird strike where the aircraft is scheduled to go for that day would be affected? One of our Airbus aircraft just had one and the thing destroyed the engine. Also the behaviour of unruly passengers also brings to bear what you see at the airport.

What has been the role of the regulatory authority NCAA in the oversight of airlines?

I have to give NCAA kudos. The NCAA has done very well. The kind of oversight they bring to bear on us is very appropriate and they can only continue to ensure and assure safety we have no problem with that. What they do to Nigerian airlines the other CAAs don’t do half of it.

They are also performing under circumstances that other CAAs might not be able to cope with. I am an advocate of taking CAA out of the civil service salary structure. The wages being paid NCAA inspectors are very poor. NCAA as a matter of urgency and safety concern their wage structure should be removed from that of civil service with immediate effect. The NCAA is losing staff they cannot compete with the airlines in getting the right workforce.

Air Peace in the last eight years what has been the growth trajectory?

We started in 2014 with seven aircraft and today we can boast of about 38 planes plus over 25 on order. We are keeping to our business plan right from day one. The growth of Air Peace has been like this because it is not for profit making. It is not for self-enrichment that I floated it. I decided to do that in order to give back to society.

My happiness is seeing thousands of indigents having their means of livelihood through Air Peace. That is why we don’t take money from Air Peace to bring to other businesses instead we bring money from other businesses to Air Peace to continue growing our capacity.

Nigerian airlines can compete with any other airline in this world it is just that we need that support. Air Peace is pro-Nigeria and we don’t owe anybody an apology for being pro-Nigeria.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3NkYXkubmcvYXZpYXRpb24vYXJ0aWNsZS95dWxldGlkZS1uaWdlcmlhbnMtbGFtZW50LWFzLWFpci1yb2FkLXRyYW5zcG9ydC1mYXJlcy1yaXNlLWFib3ZlLTEwMC_SAXNodHRwczovL2J1c2luZXNzZGF5Lm5nL2F2aWF0aW9uL2FydGljbGUveXVsZXRpZGUtbmlnZXJpYW5zLWxhbWVudC1hcy1haXItcm9hZC10cmFuc3BvcnQtZmFyZXMtcmlzZS1hYm92ZS0xMDAvP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Yuletide: Nigerians lament as air road transport fares rise above 100%,"Nigerians travelling to various parts of the country for the festive celebration are having to struggle to pay for air fares and bus fares which have since risen to over 100 percent.

“I can no longer travel with my younger brother to the village for our sister’s traditional marriage. I have to go to the village alone. I earn N100000 as monthly salary and I take care of my younger brother since our parents died. If I’m paying almost N23000 for a one-way journey to the East this will be roughly almost N50000 to and fro.

“I need some money to still take care of myself and other expenses. Where do I get such money? So it is only wise to let my brother stay while I manage to travel. The struggle is real” Chika lamented.

For those who decided to cut cost by not travelling but sending food items to their loved ones in the village they are also paying heavily to transport the items.

At the Young Shall Grow park in Mazamaza Lagos people pay between N10000 and N13000 to transport a bag of rice to the East.

“I paid N10 000 to send a bag of rice to my parents this morning. Cost of transportation to the village is very high so I thought to cut costs by just sending it to them. I was shocked when I got to The Young car park and was told that it will cost N13000 to send the rice home. I had a budget for N5000 because the last time I sent rice to the East it cost just N4000. I had to beat down the price to N10000. The cost of everything is so high and people are really suffering this period” Vivian Ogonna told BDSunday.

Air travellers are also facing a similar issue as cost of air fares have also risen.

A recent visit to the Lagos local airports showed a busy terminal with travellers processing their boarding passes.

A one-way ticket from Lagos to Abuja on Wednesday on Air Peace cost between N85000 and 120000 as against N35000 charged in January 2022. Also the airline’s one-way ticket from Lagos to Port Harcourt cost between N90000 and N120000 as against 30000 charged in January 2022. Lagos to Kano one-way flight also costs between N80000 and N120000 as against N40000.

Green Africa which started operations last year with Lagos-Abuja fares for as low as N18000 currently charges between N70 000 and N85 000 on the same route. The airline also charges between N75000 and N85000 for its Lagos-Port Harcourt flight.

United Nigeria Airlines have also raised fares from N28000 since February to N90000 for Lagos-Abuja and Lagos-Port Harcourt routes.

Stakeholders say fares may still rise as aviation fuel has become scarce.

Air passengers travelling for Christmas this season may be faced with flight delays and cancellations as a result of aviation fuel scarcity across several states in Nigeria.

The Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) on Tuesday alerted the general public to impending disruptions in scheduled flight operations due to the scarcity of aviation fuel otherwise known as JET-A1.

According to AON the scarcity has “reared its ugly head again in the past few days.”

According to the airline operators the scarcity will no doubt force them to reschedule flights leading to late operations and or cancellations.

A statement by Obiora Okonkwo spokesman AON read in part: “This unintended development is a pain on airline operators and a stain on the industry especially at this time of mass movement of people for the Christmas and New Year festivities.

“While we do our utmost best to manage the situation and ensure safe flight operations we plead the understanding of the travelling public in the circumstance.”

The aviation fuel crisis which began in late February and deteriorated further through the months of March to May has further worsened and is currently threatening the ability of airlines to continue operations with the price of JetA1 rising from N200 in December 2021 to over N400 per litre in February. Currently the price has skyrocketed to over N800 per litre.

Allen Onyema vice president of AON and the chairman of Air Peace had earlier in the year warned that if nothing was done concerning the cost of aviation fuel the fuel crisis would force airlines to suspend operations.

“Aviation fuel prices may take airlines out not only in Nigeria but everywhere in the world. Some airlines outside Nigeria have shut down because of the rising cost of aviation fuel. If these things are not addressed in Nigeria it can affect the bottom line of all airlines in Nigeria” he said.

He explained that when airline operators decided to charge N50000 as base fare they looked at cost per seat and discovered that airlines will still not make profit if they charge N60000 as base fare because multiple taxations erode the revenues of airlines.

One year ago economic base fare for tickets were between N25000 to N30000 but the airline in February 2022 increased economy tickets to N50000 and N60000 showing a 100 percent increase.

Airline operators have since increased base fare from 50000 to over N100000 depending on the price of aviation fuel.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vY3VycmVudGFmZmFpcnMuYWRkYTI0Ny5jb20vZGVmZW5jZS1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi1jb3VuY2lsLWNsZWFycy1vdmVyLSVFMiU4MiVCOTg0MDAwLWNyb3JlLXByb3Bvc2Fscy_SAW5odHRwczovL2N1cnJlbnRhZmZhaXJzLmFkZGEyNDcuY29tL2RlZmVuY2UtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tY291bmNpbC1jbGVhcnMtb3Zlci0lRTIlODIlQjk4NDAwMC1jcm9yZS1wcm9wb3NhbHMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Defence Acquisition Council Clears Over ₹84000 Crore Proposals,"In a step to augment the operational capabilities of the Armed Forces and the Indian Coast Guard in future the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) headed by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh accorded approval for Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) for 24 Capital Acquisition Proposals.

Cook's stance on privacy security and user safety echos Apple's ethos and has often lead to government agitation over these issues.

Time 100 list

Tim Cook was included in the Time 100 list for the most influential people of 2022. This is his first appearance in the list since 2015. Laurene Powell Jobs wrote Cook's profile for the piece and Cook was on one of the cover variants of the publication.

The full Time 100 cover featuring Tim Cook one of five covers being published.

""The intense pressure of setting and executing Apple's progression with deep precision and of taking responsibility for the company's effects on society is almost unimaginable"" Laurene Powell Jobs wrote. ""Yet Tim does it with compassion and discipline turning to nature to replenish his spirit.""

Tim Cook in public

As Apple's CEO Tim Cook spends a lot of time speaking publicly. Whether it's national news or a simple tweet Cook's words have power as the CEO of the world's richest tech company.

The following are snippets of public comments made by Cook or events he attended to provide an overview of how he presents himself and his goals to the public.

2022

Cook spent a lot more time in public venues in 2022 than in the previous few years since coronavirus concerns were reduced. While he didn't say much outside of his usual prepared remarks about Apple he did attend some particularly unique venues.

Aside from Cook's usual appearances during WWDC and other Apple events he was seen in several other high-profile locations like concerts and government offices. The usual ""world tour"" type of travel also resumed in 2022.

Cook attended the Grand Prix in October an Adele concert in November and toured Japan in December. While COVID-19 is still a threat concerns were reduced in 2022 thanks to widespread vaccines and testing — allowing such public appearances by the tech CEO.

He was also the guest of honor at the sixth-annual FIRST Inspire Gala in November to celebrate and comment on STEM education plus raise funding to support the nonprofit's mission. In a speech at that event Cook called education the great equalizer.

2021

""2020 was Apple's top year of innovation ever""

Tim Cook spoke with a senior college student in Beijing He Shijie. When asked about how Apple deals with the stresses of coming up with new products every year Cook said that diversity leads to innovation.

""There's no one formula for innovation"" Cook said. ""What we do is we have a culture of creativity and a culture of collaboration. These two things together when they intersect create enormous innovation.""

""We must unite against racism in all its forms""

After increasing violence against Asian Americans due to racist rhetoric blaming them for the coronavirus Cook shared a Tweet on the matter.

""The rising violence against the Asian community is a painful & urgent reminder that we must unite against racism in all its forms. There is no place for hate in our society. The team at Apple stands together & we will be donating to groups providing support to those affected.""

""Privacy is one of the top issues of the century""

During an interview Cook shared his feelings on user privacy and how it compares to other crises that humans face. ""We've got climate change — that is huge. We've got privacy — that is huge ... and they should be weighted like that and we should put our deep thinking into that and decide how we can make these things better and how do we leave something for the next generation that is a lot better than the current situation.""

2020

""Users should have the choice over the data that is being collected""

Facebook says App Tracking Transparency will cause irrevocable damage to the internet and specifically its ad-based business model.

Tim Cook says Facebook need only explain why it needs to track users

Cook shared the above image in a tweet that read: ""We believe users should have the choice over the data that is being collected about them and how it’s used. Facebook can continue to track users across apps and websites as before App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14 will just require that they ask for your permission first.""

""Carbon-neutral economy""

During the United Nations Climate Ambition Summit Cook said that everyone has a particular burden to act on the environment.

""The choice between the bottom line and the future of our planet is a false one and each new green innovation offers the proof"" Cook said. He then declared ""this is no time for changes of the margins"" and that together the group can ""transition to a carbon-neutral economy and usher in a new era of inclusive opportunity.

""Big companies deserve scrutiny""

During an interview Tim Cook was asked about climate change and how catastrophic events like the California wildfires can change opinions on the matter.

""I think the sum total of all of these — the wildfires in the west that's essentially burning millions of acres in the west the hurricanes in the south in my hometown the flooding that's taken place in the northeast and the mid-Atlantic region — all of these together I do believe will convince the people that are not currently convinced about climate change"" Cook said.

Tim Cook's history at Apple

As Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is the face of Apple and the executive team. However his gigantic impact on the company goes back long before he replaced Steve Jobs in 2011.

Jobs recruited him in 1998 from Compaq where he had been vice president for corporate materials for less than a year. Before that Cook had been at IBM for over a decade and at that time it would've seemed peculiar to leave the PC world to join Apple. The rivalry between IBM plus its clone makers like Compaq and Apple may have quietened down but it was chiefly because Apple was failing.

Apple was in such a poor state that even Cook says that ""any purely rational consideration"" meant he should stay with Compaq. Yet for all its success Compaq made clone PCs so superficially it was no different from any other commodity computer manufacturer.

Joining Apple

""I was never going to find my purpose working someplace without a clear sense of purpose of its own"" said Cook in a 2017 commencement speech. ""I tried meditation. I sought guidance and religion. I read great philosophers and authors. In a moment of youthful indiscretion I might even have experimented with a Windows PC. And obviously that didn't work.""

Tim Cook with Steve Jobs

Cook says that within minutes of being interviewed by Steve Jobs he knew he wanted to join the company – and specifically that he wanted to help resurrect Apple.

Steve Jobs had begun the turnaround of Apple when he rejoined in 1996. Famously it was the iMac that began the climb back from the brink of bankruptcy. That visibility of the Jony Ive design team's work was crucial yet the comparatively invisible role Cook took was at least as important. This was despite his not being seen as a ""product person"" consumed with design issues.

It would also have been unpopular as it was by Cook's choice that Apple closed factories and shuttered warehouses. Instead Apple outsourced manufacturing and began the same well-controlled production that it has to this day. Where previously Apple had made computers that would sit in warehouses for months before being sold Cook got those months down to days.

He wasn't the only person to see the benefit of this. Before Cook joined Apple PC maker Dell had pursued the same model with the logic that having few computers in warehouses meant the ability to adapt.

""If I've got 11 days of inventory and my competitor has 80"" said Michael Dell ""and Intel comes out with a new 450 megahertz chip that means I'm going to get to market 69 days sooner.""

Dell already had a comparatively streamlined production process because it built to order. Apple had to change a massive operation into one that should never again be caught out with too much unsold stock.

Investing smartly

Equally as important as managing a stockpile-preventing process was Apple's need to predict sales. We're now familiar with Apple selling out of devices on launch day and that is as much about the benefit of advertising its success as it is saying the predictions failed.

Nonetheless that prediction of demand is treated so seriously that there is an entire department at Apple that works on it. The current head of retail Deirdre O'Brien was instrumental in demand prediction for much of her three decades at Apple.

It isn't just about guessing how many 5G iPhones will be sold it's about knowing what technology Apple will need – and when.

Tim Cook and Angela Ahrendts

Under Tim Cook and with the benefit of greater financial stability Apple would take the unusual step of making very long-term investments in technology such as flash memory. Getting that right meant not only that Apple would have the supplies that it was going to need in its iPods and iPhone but that other companies would not.

Consequently Cook's work in streamlining and growing Apple became very well known in the industry but it wasn't until 2009 that he really became anything of a public figure.

Tim Cook becomes CEO

In that year he acted as overall CEO in the first of what would be three health-related absences by Steve Jobs. While Jobs continued to make decisions for the company Cook actually ran it.

Shortly before Jobs's death in 2011 – and at the Apple co-founder's suggestion – Cook was formally made CEO of the company.

This made him the seventh Apple CEO and he's been in the position for nearly 10 years. John Scully lasted for 10 years as CEO and Steve Jobs had the title for 14. It's still the case that Sculley ultimately had the most detrimental effect on Apple and that Jobs had the most visibly successful. But Cook's tenure has seen the CEO role change more than ever.

He's taken time to recruit some key people such as Angela Ahrendts who ran Apple retail for five years. He's also reportedly been swift to cut people when needed.

Scott Forstall was reportedly forced out of Apple over refusing to sign an apology about Apple Maps' failings

Both as an individual and as CEO Cook has been far more outspoken on social issues than any of his predecessors. Where Jobs may perhaps have cultivated the public perception of him as the face of Apple Cook has directly presented himself as such over issues ranging from privacy and security to sexuality.

Personal life

In 2014 Cook came out as gay specifically to use his position to help others.

""[If] hearing that the CEO of Apple is gay can help someone struggling to come to terms with who he or she is or bring comfort to anyone who feels alone or inspire people to insist on their equality"" he said ""then it’s worth the trade-off with my own privacy.""

Tim Cook is now regularly interviewed on social issues

More recently Cook has seen criticism over Apple's resistance to providing backdoor access to iPhones for the FBI and for how he failed to factually correct President Trump during a joint press conference.

However whether one disagrees with Cook or not the former resistance is in line with his and Apple's stated position about protecting our privacy. And the latter is a shrewd politician who knows very well what battles like DACA are ones he cares about.

More than Steve Jobs ever did Tim Cook now also speaks publicly about issues where technology intersects with issues of politics and especially privacy.

Philanthropy

While Cook is more visibly engaged with social and security debates he does continue to remain a particularly private individual. For all that he is instantly recognizable he's still very much the face of Apple instead of a celebrity in his own right.

So for instance it's chiefly only through required financial disclosures that we learn of how Cook regularly donates significant sums of money to charities.

That's part of a plan where Cook reportedly intends to fund his nephew's education and donate the rest of his money to charity.

Investments outside Apple

Unsurprisingly Cook concentrates his efforts and attention nearly exclusively on Apple or on issues where the company plays a part. He does however regularly work out at a gym.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmMuY29tL21hcmNlbC1zY2h3YW50ZXMvYXBwbGUtY2VvLXRpbS1jb29rLXNheXMtd2hhdC1zZXBhcmF0ZXMtc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bC1wZW9wbGUtZnJvbS1ldmVyeW9uZS1lbHNlLXJlYWxseS1jb21lcy1kb3duLXRvLTQtd29yZHMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple CEO Tim Cook Says What Separates Successful People From Everyone Else Really Comes Down to 4 Words,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/apple-ceo-tim-cook-says-what-separates-successful-people-from-everyone-else-really-comes-down-to-4-words.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmMuY29tL21hcmNlbC1zY2h3YW50ZXMvYXBwbGUtY2VvLXRpbS1jb29rLXNheXMtd2hhdC1zZXBhcmF0ZXMtc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bC1wZW9wbGUtZnJvbS1ldmVyeW9uZS1lbHNlLXJlYWxseS1jb21lcy1kb3duLXRvLTQtd29yZHMuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2FwcGxlLWZhY2VzLWNsYXNzLWFjdGlvbi1sYXdzdWl0LWFsbGVnaW5nLXJhY2lhbC1iaWFzLXdhdGNocy1ibG9vZC1veGltZXRlctIBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2FwcGxlLWZhY2VzLWNsYXNzLWFjdGlvbi1sYXdzdWl0LWFsbGVnaW5nLXJhY2lhbC1iaWFzLXdhdGNocy1ibG9vZC1veGltZXRlci5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Apple faces class-action lawsuit alleging 'racial bias' in watch's blood oximeter,"A New York man filed a class-action lawsuit against Apple on Dec. 24 alleging that the Apple Watch's blood oximeter has a ""racial bias"" against individuals with darker skin tones.

American semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials will build a $600 million plant here that will expand its manufacturing and research operations and create 1000 new jobs The new facility in Tampines Industrial Crescent will be spread over 700000 sq ft with 100000 sq ft of its rooftop covered with solar panels to produce clean energy the firm announced on Thursday.The company also unveiled an eight-year plan dubbed Singapore 2030 to continue expanding its operations here which already represent the bulk of its production capacity outside the United States.President and Chief Executive Gary Dickerson said: “For the past 30 years Singapore has been a strategic hub for Applied Materials and we are excited to build on our success with new investments.”He noted that its plans are in line with estimates for the global chip industry to grow beyond US$1 trillion (S$1.35 trillion) in market value by the end of this decade double the size of today’s market.Mr. Dickerson said the new investment would allow the company to meet growing customer demand accelerate commercialisation of new technologies and services and bolster its research and development (R&D) capabilities.Applied Materials is also one of the top employers in Singapore’s precision engineering sector.The company established its presence in Singapore in 1991 with a small sales office and has since expanded in manufacturing and R&D.Its workforce here now stands at 2500.Mr. Brian Tan regional president of Applied Materials Southeast Asia  said that the new facility will open in 2024 and will employ an additional 1000 staff once it is fully functional.These jobs will include roles in manufacturing customer support and R&D.Dr. Beh Swan Gin chairman of the Economic Development Board said at a groundbreaking ceremony at Parkroyal Collection in Marina Bay that Applied Material’s 2030 plan will help drive the growth of Singapore’s precision engineering sector which accounted for $47.6 billion of output and $15.1 billion value-added in 2021.The semiconductor industry has been hit by high inventories and slower global economic growth but Dr. Beh noted: “We are confident that the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries in Singapore will be able to ride out the short-term challenges.”Worldwide sales of semiconductors dropped in the July-to-September period by 6.3 percent the first quarterly decline in about three years according to the Washington-based Semiconductor Industry Association.Applied Materials’ new investment in Singapore follows expansion plans by global peers such as Micron Technology GlobalFoundries Soitec and Siltronic here. Experts believe these investments show that Singapore – the world’s fourth-largest chip supplier – will continue to be a major hub for the industry.(Source: The Straits Times)",,,,,,,,,,,,

(0:28)

Open Extended Reactions

ASHBURN Va. -- Jayden Daniels' first rookie minicamp practice did not include any ""wow"" moments where he could show his speed or all of his arm talent. It was a routine one-hour workout designed to get the rookies comfortable with the Washington Commanders playbook.

But during those 60 minutes his new teammates took notice of what Daniels could offer the Commanders.

""He's a stud"" third-round receiver Luke McCaffrey said. ""I know he's one heck of a quarterback and a lot of fun to play with from a personality standpoint. I've had a blast in these 24 hours with him. ... He's just fun to be around; he's good energy.""

Added second-round tight end Ben Sinnott: ""He has the 'it' factor.""

Washington selected Daniels with the second pick in last month's draft making him the franchise's latest hope at quarterback. The team started eight different passers in the last four years and nobody has started for more than three consecutive seasons since Mark Rypien from 1989 to '93. Since that time Washington has drafted five other quarterbacks in the first round and none became the long-term answer.

Daniels' presence led to more interest than usual in the Commanders' first rookie workout as approximately 55 media members attended -- at least 20 more than usual according to a team spokesman. He smiled often and during breaks could be seen laughing with coaches or teammates. He lofted accurate deep passes down the middle of the field against no defenders and was accurate during a 7-on-7 drill with one off-target pass that resulted in a one-handed grab by undrafted free agent Marcus Rosemy-Jacksaint.

Daniels said Friday was just about ""day one install"" of the playbook. But he also said he soaked in seeing his helmet in the locker and putting on his yellow No. 5 practice jersey.

""Man it was awesome"" he said. He added that scenes like this brought out ""that 9-year-old kid in me just realizing that his dreams came true and now I'm here but I've still got a long way to go.""

Sinnott said he worked out with Daniels at times in the offseason -- as well as undrafted free agent quarterback Sam Hartman. He said he saw Daniels' accuracy on film and then realized it in person. He saw him as others did create plays with his legs as well.

""He's a super talented kid a great dude I really like to be around and hopefully grow with"" Sinnott said. ""There are just guys who players naturally get attracted to and revolve around and he's got that personality where you want to work with him and want to watch film with him and you want to be out here working with him.""

Daniels said this weekend is also about developing his leadership in the NFL before he starts working with the veterans at OTA practices.

""Just being myself being a hard worker"" he said. ""Don't try to be somebody I'm not. People see who's authentic and who's not. Try to make connections talk to people. Obviously I'm 23 it's a lot of different age ranges in this locker room so try to relate as much as possible show them I'm all about the team I'm all about hard work.""

And for now it's about learning the playbook and then earning the starting job.

""Just going through the lumps of being a rookie and trying to learn how to be a pro"" Daniels said. ""I don't have a definitive answer for you what I needed to work on. I'm just trying to learn as much as possible.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L211c2ljLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvYWJiYS1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS1ldXJvdmlzaW9uLXdhdGVybG9vL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sweden celebrates Abba at this year's Eurovision Song Contest,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.washingtonpost.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /entertainment/music/2024/05/10/abba-anniversary-eurovision-waterloo/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021224DE0850>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L211c2ljLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvYWJiYS1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS1ldXJvdmlzaW9uLXdhdGVybG9vL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

The primary data source for this study is the clinical narratives from UF Health IDR a research data warehouse of UF Health. This study was approved by the UF Institutional Review Board (IRB202100049). We collected clinical notes from 2011–2021 from over 126 departments ~2 million patients and 50 million encounters from inpatient outpatient and emergency settings. Then we merged the UF Health clinical corpus with three additional corpora including the MIMIC-III corpus38 in the clinical domain with 0.5 billion words a PubMed (combining PubMed abstracts and full-text commercial-collection) collection36 in the biomedical domain with 6 billion words and a Wikipedia articles dump36 in the general domain with 2.5 billion words to generate a corpus with >90 billion words.

Preprocessing and de-identification of text

We performed minimal preprocessing including (1) removing empty and duplicated clinical notes unifying all text into UTF-8 encoding and removing illegal UTF-8 strings; (2) normalizing special characters (e.g. convert ‘&’ to ‘&;’ ‘\xa0’ to ‘space’); (3) tokenization and sentence boundary detection. For clinical text from UF Health we further applied a de-identification system42 to remove protected health information (PHI) from clinical text. (Approved under IRB202100049) We adopted the safe-harbor method to identify 18 PHI categories defined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and replaced them with dummy strings (e.g. replace people’s names into [**NAME**]).

Study design

Figure 3 shows an overview of the study design. We seek to train a large clinical transformer model GatorTron using >90 billion words and examine how and whether scaling up model size improves performance on five clinical NLP tasks. We first pretrained GatorTron using the >90 billion words by optimizing a masked language model (MLM) and then applied GatorTron to five different clinical NLP tasks using a supervised fine-tuning. We adopted the BERT architecture (Fig. 4) implemented in Megatron-LM and explored three different settings including a base model of 345 million parameters (i.e. GatorTron-base) a medium model of 3.9 billion parameters (i.e. GatorTron-medium) and a large model of 8.9 billion parameters (i.e. GatorTron-large). Then we compared the three GatorTron models to an existing transformer model from the clinical domain ClinicalBERT (trained with 110 million parameters) and two transformer models from the biomedical domain including BioBERT (345 million parameters) and BioMegatron (1.2 billion parameters). We compared the models on five clinical NLP tasks including clinical concept extraction relation extraction semantic textual similarity natural language inference and medical question answering. We used six public benchmark datasets in the clinical domain.

Training environment

We used a total number of 992 NVIDIA DGX A100 GPUs from 124 superPOD nodes at UF’s HiPerGator-AI cluster to train GatorTron models by leveraging both data-level and model-level parallelisms implemented by the Megatron-LM package43. We monitored the training progress by training loss and validation loss and stopped the training when there was no further improvement (i.e. the loss plot became flat).

GatorTron model configuration

We developed GatorTron models with three configurations and determined the number of layers hidden sizes and number of attention heads according to the guidelines for optimal depth-to-width parameter allocation proposed by Levin et al.44 as well as our previous experience in developing BioMegatron. Table 3 provides detailed information for the three settings. The GatorTron-base model has 24 layers of transformer blocks which is similar to the architecture of BERT-large model. For each layer we set the number of hidden units as 1024 and attention heads as 16. The GatorTron-medium model scaled up to 3.9 billion parameters (~10 times of the base setting) and the GatorTron-large model scaled up to 8.9 billion parameters which is similar to BioMegatron43 (with 8.3 billion parameters).

Train GatorTron models from scratch

We pretrained a vocabulary from scratch using >90 billion words of corpus following the byte-pair-encoding algorithm45. We inherited the BERT-style architecture and trained GatorTron models from scratch using two self-supervised tasks including masked language modeling (MLM) and sentence-order prediction (SOP). We followed the similar strategy in the BERT model46 to randomly mask 15% of the input tokens with a special token (i.e. [MASK]) in the MLM. The SOP was formulated as a task to predict the order of two consecutive segments of text28. The input for SOP consists of two consecutive sentences from the training corpus in random orders and the training objective is to determine whether the two input sentences are in the correct order. The GatorTron-large model with 8.9 billion parameters is too large to fit one GPU therefore we sliced it into four pieces for distributed training using model parallelism. We pretrained the GatorTron-base and medium model without model slicing. The default loss function defined in BERT model46 was used. Figure 4 shows the distributed training of GatorTron-large model using model parallelism. (See https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM for more details)

Existing transformer models for comparison

BioBERT11: The BioBERT model was developed by further training the original BERT-large model (345 million parameters 24 layers 1024 hidden units and 16 attention heads) using biomedical literature from PubMed Abstracts (4.5 billion words) and PMC Full-text articles (13.5 billion words). In this study we used version 1.1.

ClinicalBERT37: The ClinicalBERT model was developed by further training the BioBERT (base version; 110 million parameters with 12 layers 768 hidden units and 12 attention heads) using clinical text from the MIMIC-III38 corpus.

BioMegatron36: The BioMegatron models adopted the BERT architecture with a different number of parameters from 345 million to 1.2 billion. Different from BioBERT and ClinicalBERT the BioMegatron was trained from scratch without leveraging the original BERT model.

Fine-tune GatorTron for five clinical NLP tasks evaluation matrices and benchmark datasets

We fine-tuned pretrained GatorTron models for five different clinical NLP tasks using experts’ annotations from six public benchmark datasets. Specifically we first generated distributed representation from the inputs of a specific task then added additional output layers (classification or regression) to generate target outputs. We used cross-entropy (CE) loss for classification tasks and mean square error loss for regression tasks. For a classification task with N categories let C i be the score generated by a transformer model for category i the probability Pi of a given sample be classified to category i was calculated as:

$$P_i = \frac{{e^{C_i}}}{{\mathop {\sum }

olimits_{j = 1}^N e^{C_j}}}$$ (1)

Let t i be the ground truth category the cross-entropy loss L CE is defined as:

$$L_{CE} = - \mathop {\sum}\limits_{i = 1}^N {t_i{{{\mathrm{log}}}}(P_i)}$$ (2)

Fine-tune GatorTron for clinical concept extraction

This is a task to recognize phrases with important clinical meanings (e.g. medications treatments adverse drug events). The task is to determine the boundaries of a concept and classify it into predefined semantic categories. Early systems for clinical concept extract are often rule-based yet most recent systems are based on machine learning models such as conditional random fields (CRFs)4748 convolutional neural networks (CNN)949 and recurrent neural networks (RNN) implemented with long-short-term memory strategy (LSTM)1050. Current state-of-the-art models are based on transformers such as the ClinicalBERT. We approached clinical concept extraction as a sequence labeling problem and adopted ‘BIO’ labeling schema where ‘B-’ and ‘I-’ are prefixes indicating words at the beginning and inside of a concept and ‘O’ stands for words located outside of any concepts of interest. Using this definition we approached the task as a classification problem—for each word in a sentence predict a label in [‘B’ ‘I’ ‘O’]. When there are multiple categories of concepts a suffix was attached to ‘BIO’ for discrimination (e.g. ‘B-drug’ ‘I-drug’). Based on the representation generated by pretrained GatorTron models we added a classification layer (a linear layer with softmax activation) to calculate a probability score for each ‘BIO’ category. The cross-entropy loss was used for fine-tuning. We trained a unified classifier to extract all concepts for datasets without overlapped concepts. For datasets with overlapped concepts we trained individual models to recognize each category of concept separately following our previous strategy51. We used three benchmark datasets developed by the 2010 i2b2 challenge39 2012 i2b2 challenge40 and 2018 n2c2 challenge41 to evaluate GatorTron models focusing on identifying important medical concepts (e.g. medications adverse drug events treatments) from clinical text. We used precision recall and F1 score for evaluation.

Fine-tune GatorTron for medical relation extraction

MRE is to establish medical-related relations (e.g. induce relation) among clinical concepts (e.g. drugs adverse events). MRE is usually approached as a classification problem—identify pairs of concepts with valid relations and classify the relation type. Various machine learning-based classifiers such as support vector machines (SVMs) random forests (RF) and gradient boosting trees (GBT)41 have been applied. With the emergence of deep learning models researchers have explored the long-short-term memory (LSTM) architecture for RE in both general and clinical domains5253. Most recently several studies adopted the BERT architecture and demonstrated superior performance for MRE on various datasets545556575859. We approached MRE as a classification task. First candidate concept pairs were generated using heuristic rules developed in our previous study41. Then we identified two sentences where the two concepts in a pair were located. We introduced two sets of entity markers (i.e. [S1] [E1] and [S2] [E2]) to indicate the two concepts. If the two concepts were in the same sentence the two input sentences will be the same but labeled with different markers (e.g. [S1] and [E1] were used in the first sentence; [S2] and [E2] were used in the second sentence). To determine the relation type we concatenated the representations of the model special [CLS] token and all four entity markers and added a classification layer (a linear layer with softmax activation) for classification. Similarly the cross-entropy loss was used to fine-tune GatorTron. We used the dataset developed by the 2018 n2c2 challenge41 with a focus on relations between medications and adverse drug events. The precision recall and F1 score were used for evaluation.

Fine-tune GatorTron for semantic textual similarity

The STS task is to quantitatively assess the semantic similarity between two text snippets (e.g. sentences) which is usually approached as a regression task where a real-value score was used to quantify the similarity between two text snippets. In the general domain the STS benchmark (STS-B) dataset curated by the Semantic Evaluation (SemEval) challenges between 2012 and 201760 is widely used for evaluating STS systems13. Various machine learning methods have been examined616263 but transformer-based systems such as RoBERTa25 T527 and ALBERT28 are leading the state-of-the-art models for STS. In the clinical domain the MedSTS dataset64 that consists of over 1000 annotated sentence pairs from clinical notes at Mayo Clinic was widely used as the benchmark. MedSTS was used as the gold standard in two clinical NLP open challenges including the 2018 BioCreative/Open Health NLP (OHNLP) challenge65 and 2019 n2c2/OHNLP ClinicalSTS shared task66. Similar to the general domain pretrained transformer-based models using clinical text and biomedical literature including ClinicalBERT and BioBERT67 achieved state-of-the-art performance. In this study we formulated STS as a regression problem. We applied pretrained GatorTron models to learn the sentence-level representations of the two pieces of text and adopted a linear regression layer to calculate the similarity score. Different from classification models we used MSE as the loss function. We used the dataset developed by the 2019 n2c2/OHNLP66 challenge on clinical semantic textural similarity66. The Pearson correlation score was used for evaluation.

Fine-tune GatorTron for natural language inference

NLI is also known as recognizing textual entailment (RTE)—a directional relation between text fragments (e.g. sentences)68. The goal of NLI is to determine if a given hypothesis can be inferred from a given premise. In the general domain two benchmark datasets—the MultiNLI69 and the Stanford NLI70 are widely used. On both datasets pretrained transformer models achieved state-of-the-art performances2729. There are limited resources for NLI in the clinical domain. Until recently the MedNLI—a dataset annotated by doctors based on the medical history of patients71 was developed as a benchmark dataset in the clinical domain. A previous study37 showed that a pretrained clinical BERT model achieved the state-of-the-art performance and outperformed the baseline (InferSent72) by ~9% accuracy. In this study we approached NLI as a classification problem. We concatenated the hypothesis and premise as the input separated using a special token [SEP] and applied pretrained GatorTron models to generate distributed representations which were fed into a classification layer (a linear layer with softmax activation) to calculate a probability for each of the three categories of entailment contradiction and neutral. The cross-entropy loss was used for fine-tuning. We evaluated the GatorTron models on NLI using the MedNLI dataset71 and used accuracy for comparison.

Fine-Tune GatorTron for medical question answering

The MQA task is to build NLP systems that automatically answer medical questions in a natural language which is the most complex challenge among the five tasks. Unlike other tasks focusing on phrases and sentences MQA is a document-level task that requires information from the whole document to generate answers according to questions. In the general domain the Stanford Question Answering Datasets (SQuAD 1.1 and 2.0)7374 have been widely used as benchmarks. Transformer-based models are state-of-the-art for both SQuAD1.118 and SQuAD2.031. There are several MQA datasets developed in the past few years such as the MESHQA75 MedQuAD76 and emrQA77. In this study we approached MQA using a machine reading comprehension (MRC) technique where the goal is to extract the most relevant responses (i.e. short text snippets or entities) from the given context according to questions. We applied a span classification algorithm to identify the start and end offsets of the answer from the context. More specifically we packed the question and the context into a single sequence as input for GatorTron and applied two linear layers to predict the start and end position of the answer respectively. As GatorTron models were developed using a maximum token length of 512 we limited the maximum length of questions to 64 tokens and the rest of the 446 tokens (including special tokens such as [CLS] and [SEP]) were used for the context. We truncated questions with more than 64 tokens. For contexts the had more than 446 tokens we adopted a sliding window strategy to scan the whole document using a window size of 446 tokens and a stride size of 396 tokens so that two consecutive windows had the same 50 tokens overlapped. We also limited the answers to a maximum length of 32 tokens. We used the emrQA dataset77 which is widely used as a benchmark dataset for MQA. We particularly focused on medications and relations-related questions as Yue et al.78 found that the two subsets are more consistent. We utilized both F1 score and exact match score for evaluation.

Our use-case has two separate databases that store cycle times and error reports data respectively. The PDA system in our use-case registers and stores action duration tuples u in the cycle times database. The data are processed by our VMAS which consists of two main components: 1.) an error classification module for identifying source and knock-on errors within our dataset; and 2.) a duration prediction module trained to predict the time required for n future actions. We describe each component in detail below and a flowchart can be found in Fig. 3.

Module 1: error classification

We begin with an actions dataset \(\mathcal {D}_a\) and an error reports database that stores timestamped error logs as well as the duration of the logged errors. Each sample \(x \in \mathcal {D}_a\) is a sequence of action duration tuples \(x = (u_0 u_{1} u_{2} \ldots  u_n)\) where n is the number of actions executed during a complete sequence. The error classification module of our workflow allows us to identify the most significant errors within our dataset and distinguishes source from knock-on errors. More specifically this module allows us to split samples from our dataset into four subsets: normal \(\mathcal {D}_{n}\) source errors \(\mathcal {D}_{s}\) knock-on errors \(\mathcal {D}_{k}\) and misc \(\mathcal {D}_{m}\). This splitting of the dataset into sub-sets serves two purposes: i.) The classification in \(\mathcal {D}_{s}\) and \(\mathcal {D}_{k}\) helps the stakeholder to conduct an automated analysis of all actions and it eliminates the need for manual and often time consuming inspection of actions; ii.) During preliminary trials we found that samples from \(\mathcal {D}_{m}\) are exceedingly rare and disturb the training of the seq2seq models. Therefore the error classification module also provides a valuable preprocessing step prior to training our seq2seq models to predict future delays. Below we first discuss our approach for labelling our samples and then formally define the conditions for a sequence x to belong to one of the four subsets. We note that for our VMAS there is an assumption that all source errors are logged errors.

Labelling We use the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method for the labelling of anomalous behavior. For each action a a normal (Gaussian) distribution is sought that fits the existing data distribution with respect to the frequency of each duration (for an example see Fig. 2).

Figure 2 Peak detection in a histogram of durations for a specific action utilizing MLE as a threshold based on data from a real-world car production dataset recorded by Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles. Peaks above the MLE threshold (red) are considered as significant errors. Full size image

The density function of the normal distribution contains two parameters: the expected value μ and standard deviation σ which determine the shape of the density function and the probability corresponding to a point in the distribution. The MLE method is a parametric estimation procedure that finds μ and σ that seem most plausible for the distribution of the observation z 24:

$$\begin{aligned} f(z \mid \mu  \sigma ^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma ^2}} \exp \left( -\frac{(z-\mu )^2}{2\sigma ^2}\right) . \end{aligned}$$ (1)

The density function describes the magnitude of the probability of z coming from a distribution with μ and σ. The joint density function can be factorised as follows:

$$\begin{aligned} f(z_1 z_2 \ldots  z_n \mid \vartheta ) = \Pi ^n_{i=1}f(z_i \mid \vartheta ) \end{aligned}$$ (2)

For a fixed observed variable the joint density function of z can be interpreted. This leads to likelihood function:

$$\begin{aligned} L(\vartheta ) = \Pi ^n_{i=1}f_\vartheta (z_i) \end{aligned}$$ (3)

The value of \(\vartheta \) is sought for which the sample values \(z_1 z_2 \ldots z_n\) have the largest density function. Therefore the higher the likelihood the more plausible a parameter value \(\vartheta \) is. As long as the likelihood function is differentiable the maximum of the function can be determined. Thus the parameters μ and σ can be obtained.

Next we seek to identify high frequency peaks with respect to the durations \(d^a\) for an action a that exceed the nominal duration \(d^a_{norm}\). We are interested in significant errors where we use the MLE threshold to determine if an error is significant or not. We denote significant errors as \(d^a_{sig}\). These abnormal and distinct duration are indicating a recurring behaviour. We formally define the criteria for each sub-set below:

Source errors are samples where for each complete sequence x  we have at least one action duration that is considered critical of statistical significance and is accompanied by an error message. More formally: a complete action sequence x is considered a source error sequence \(x \in \mathcal {D}_{s}\) iff there exists an action duration tuple \(u \in x\) where the duration is \(d^a_{sig}\) and there is a corresponding error message in the error reports database.

Knock on errors meet the same criteria as source errors but lack an accompanying error message for \(d^a_{sig}\). Therefore a complete action sequence x is considered a knock-on error sequence \(x \in \mathcal {D}_{s}\) iff there exists an action duration tuple \(u \in x\) where the duration is \(d^a_{sig}\) and there is not a corresponding error message in in the error reports database.

Normal samples don’t include \(d^a_{sig}\). Therefore a complete sequence x is considered a normal sequence \(x \in \mathcal {D}_{n}\) iff for all \(u \in x\) there does not exist a duration \(d^a_{sig}\).

Misc contains two types of complete action sequences: i.) where for an action u there is a duration \(d^a_{sig}\) that is above a defined global threshold \(d^a_{globalmax}\) meaning the duration is either intended (e. g. the production line is paused) or staff are handling them; and ii.) where x consists only of duration d that exceed the nominal duration but each of low significance i. e. not exceeding the corresponding MLE threshold.

It is worth noting that \(\mathscr {D}_{n} \cup \mathscr {D}_{s} \cup \mathscr {D}_{k}\) may contain individual \(d^a\) above the nominal duration but below the threshold determined by the MLE and therefore are errors of low significance. There can also exist an intersection between source and knock-on errors. Furthermore the labelling of knock-on errors is deliberately modular as different methods can be applied here based on the stakeholder’s requirements. Naturally this will impact the subsequent training of our seq2seq models and therefore their predictions.

Module 2: action duration prediction

While our error classification module assigns labels to past errors our second module focuses on the prediction of future errors. Upon removing misc samples we utilize our dataset to train seq2seq models to predict knock-on errors. Given a sequence of action duration tuples our objective is to predict the time required by each of the next n steps. We therfore convert the data received from the error classification module into a dataset containing pairs \((x y) \in \mathscr {D}\) where each x is a sequence of action duration tuples \(x = (u_{t-n} u_{t-n+1} u_{t-n+2} \ldots u_t)\) and y is the duration of the n actions that follow \(y = (d^a_{t} d^a_{t+1} d^a_{t+2} \ldots d^a_{t+n})\). Using these data we train and evaluate popular seq2seq models including LSTM25 GRU14 and the Transformer17. The later is of particular interest as it represents the current state-of-the-art for a number of seq2seq tasks. Vaswani et al.17 presented the Transformer architecture for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) or Transductor task domain. Previous RNN/CNN architectures pose a natural obstacle to the parallelization of sequences. The Transformer architecture replaces the recurrent architecture by its attention mechanism and encodes the symbolic position in the sequence. This relates two distant sequences of input and output which in turn can take place in parallel. The time for training is thereby significantly shortened. At the same time the sequential computation is reduced and the complexity O(1) of dependencies between two symbols regardless of their distance from each other in the sequence remains the same17. Next we consider a novel metric for fairly evaluating models of different architectures–in particular regarding the number of steps n–using a single scalar (Fig. 3).",,,,,,

FAYETTEVILLE Ark. — It is sorta surprising the Razorbacks' appearance in the AutoZone Liberty Bowl is only their sixth time.

Surprising because on a clear day you can see the state from the top of the press box. Don't ask we weren't supposed to be up there but it was over 45 years ago so the statute of limitations has expired and the witnesses are probably dead.

It is the only bowl game that is literally just a few short miles from the state of Arkansas borders.

The Razorbacks did play in the first Monday night game there in 1971. Considering the highlight of that game was wide receiver Jim Hodge literally blowing past Tennessee All-American free safety Bobby Majors for the Hogs' only touchdown we'll move along.

By the way you still may not want to bring up the name Preston Watts to any old-timers like myself because he was chased out of the stadium by some Razorback faithful that now seems rather over-kill.

Until then the Liberty Bowl was an afternoon affair that always tried to get somebody close but the Hogs were playing in bigger things during the 1960's. After ABC's success with Monday Night Football in 1970 they got that game on for the first Monday after the NFL regular season ended.

It was a different time.

Which takes us to 1976 and the Liberty Bowl. There would be no way today Elvis Presley could have slipped into any bowl game and sat through a little bit of any football game.

Alabama had a sub-par year in 1976 finishing the season 8-3. Bear Bryant worried about his job when that happened in those days.

When he drew UCLA he worked his team like a national championship game.

Through some questions that morning while working at The Pine Bluff Commercial I managed to get into the press box for that game but ended up alone on the back row of the new media facilities. I was 19 and had my first full-time job then so I would pretty much do anything with no notice.

Obviously the weather affected attendance in the box because about the only people there were from Alabama UCLA and the Memphis area. I had the back row to myself.

Until I noticed some folks wearing sunglasses milling around early in the second quarter and somebody sat down a couple of chairs away with empties between us. Nobody else with them sat down.

He looked at me because I was probably staring a little stuck out a hand and said ""Hi I'm Elvis Presley."" I had already figured that out.

""No s###"" was the best I could come up with along with laughing. He (and his surrounding folks) all laughed thank goodness.

Not a single person I saw came up to him other than his group which wouldn't happen these days. For youngsters to imagine it combine Garth Brooks with Michael Jackson in popularity and you still aren't where he was in terms of drawing a crowd.

Nobody would book him at a stadium because of the security problems.

He had asked me where I was from and ""how in the hell Alabama was ahead 24-0 already?"" when he got there. It was probably unremarkable to him.

Elvis had been at the Pine Bluff Convention Center in the summer of 1976 (and was the first sell-out there ... it had opened that year) and a week or two later was at Barton Coliseum in Little Rock. Went to both.

Right after halftime he got up to leave said ""good to meet you man"" and was surrounded by his group and was gone.

In case you were wondering the Crimson Tide won the game 38-6. They played on New Year's Day the next five straight years winning Bryant's last two national championships including a 24-9 drubbing of Arkansas in the 1980 Sugar Bowl. The Hogs still haven't tackled Major Oglivie.

In August after that Elvis left the building for good.

What is the Kansas offensive game plan what do they try to do scheme-wise and who are key players to watch?

The KU game plan on offense when they are clicking is to use multiple formations and ways to move the ball. The offense was at their best earlier in the year when Jalon Daniels was healthy and they were using the whole playbook. They put the option in during the summer and they had defenses guessing in the first half of the year. Daniels was running option and they were using QB designed run plays. They were running the ball well which opened the passing lanes. Then Daniels got hurt and the offense adjusted minus some of the playbook. Daniels is back and appeared to be healthy the last game of the season against Kansas State. You started to see some of it come back and they hope to open up the playbook against Arkansas.

What is the defensive alignment and who are key players on that side of the ball?

KU runs a 4-3 defense and that is what they installed when Brian Borland took over as the defensive coordinator last season. They have struggled against the run. Lonnie Phelps was a second-team All Big 12 selection and is their best pass rusher. They rotate a lot of defensive linemen. Craig Young is their most active linebacker who transferred from Ohio State. Kenny Logan has been a staple in the secondary. Cobee Bryant was a first team selection at corner.

Who are some players that Kansas will be missing?

When it comes to health and players being available the Jayhawks are in good shape. They lost Eriq Gilyard to the transfer portal and he was giving them good snaps as a back-up linebacker. Daniels appears to be healthy and running back Devin Neal is healed up after playing through bumps and bruises late in the season. It looks like Daniel Hishaw could miss time at running back based on the latest information from Leipold. They haven’t lost anyone to the portal who wasn’t expected to leave outside of Gilyard.

What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Jayhawks?

The defense has struggled against the run. They are ranked 114th against the run and gave up big yards in the last half of the season. The special teams has been inconsistent much of the year. They replaced Jacob Borcila at kicker. The Jayhawks rank last in the league in field goal percentage and punting. A strength has been moving the ball even when Daniels wasn’t playing. Offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki has been creative and it was the big reason for the early success and 5-0 start.

According to a 2019 report on international trade and counterfeiting by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) the total value of counterfeit and pirated goods accounted for just over 3 percent of world trade an estimated 590 billion USD. That number is expected to have nearly tripled and is predicted to grow to a monumental 2.3 trillion USD by the end of 2022.

Looking at the past decade there have been many factors that have influenced the growth of counterfeit goods. One of which is the rising use of e-commerce websites such as Amazon Alibaba Etsy and eBay.

In a 2021 report by Dharmesh Mehta Amazon’s vice president worldwide selling partners services the e-commerce giant detected seized and destroyed more than two million counterfeit goods that were sent to its fulfillment centers. In the same report Mehta mentioned that less than 0.01 percent of all products sold on Amazon received counterfeit complaints from customers. The company also has established its Counterfeit Crimes Unit which looks to ‘build and refer cases to law enforcement undertake independent investigations or joint investigations with brands and pursue civil litigation against counterfeiters’.

Each of these e-commerce companies are working to combat the rising number of counterfeit goods across the world cracking down on a number of listings that are alleged to be counterfeit and avoiding any future lawsuits from global luxury brands such as Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent. This however comes at a time when consumers are beginning to be more skeptical of the authenticity of many products and not just luxury goods.

‘In addition to the most common categories of counterfeited clothes and luxury products seized because of the pandemic there is a growing trade in fake products which has the potential risk on humans’ health such as counterfeit medicines food and beverages cosmetics and toys’ says Paola Iannone vice president marketing and communications and Nicolas Günther managing director of QR marketing – brand by All4Labels in a report provided to L&L.

At All4Labels the company looks to securely protect a company’s brand in the cloud

A study carried out by Censuswide and sponsored by Digimarc surveyed consumers across the UK and US to find out if their desire for authentic products isn’t limited to only luxury items. The study found that 40 percent of consumers believe that online shopping has added to the sale of counterfeit goods. This study also found that 67 percent of consumers are worried about product authenticity when buying goods for their homes and families. Fifty-six percent of consumers are worried that they are purchasing new products that may actually be counterfeit.

For specific products it’s easy to take a more simplistic approach to brand protection. But for certain products as the risk to the consumer is heightened brands have to think about what harm would come to the consumer if it’s tampered with

In the United States this worry came to fruition during an infant formula shortage in early 2022 when the market was flooded with counterfeit products packaged with forged labels. It left many parents with packages that were expired or formula that contained ingredients that could be dangerous to infants requiring a special diet due to certain allergies or intolerances.

In terms of brand protection and security this according to Michael Welch senior product manager at Avery Dennison Label and Packaging Materials is where brand owners should start taking notice of what protection methods they’re using to ensure only legitimate products reach a consumer’s home.

‘For specific products it’s easy to take a more simplistic approach to brand protection. But for certain products as the risk to the consumer is heightened brands must think about what harm would come to the consumer if the products is tampered with’ says Welch.

This rise in counterfeiting and the growing concern from consumers about purchasing counterfeit goods has been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. Due to the increased consumer demand the shifting value chain and unpredictable supply chains coupled with the subsequent shortages across many markets counterfeiters have found new opportunities to trade in fake items exploiting weaknesses by offering similar products at a lower-than-average price point.

‘The Covid-19 pandemic has overwhelmed global business and to date has created the most substantial negative supply chain security effect in history’ notes the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). ‘The pandemic has also provided opportunities for criminal organizations that seek to take advantage of the rise in demand and subsequent shortages of parts and products. Reduced volume of genuine materials allows criminals to offer counterfeit raw materials that contaminate supply chains.’

Though this may sound like a defeatist mentality that the rise in counterfeiting is an unstoppable force that cannot be combated there are ways to slow down the progress. To ensure that a company’s product and its brand are at least more difficult to counterfeit.

How to protect your brand

From fluorescent inks to taggants to frangible films to RFID tags there are several security-based products available on the market to protect brands. But how does a company decide which methods to implement?

With the number of options a company can choose from it may be easy to fall into option paralysis where the amount of decisions and choices to select from can make it overwhelming.

There is no silver bullet when it comes to brand protection. There is no single solution that will completely stop any counterfeiting

‘There are a lot of factors to take into account when you’re developing a brand protection strategy’ says Tessa Eastman connected products strategist at Systech International a company that develops software suites for authentication and traceability systems to combat counterfeiting prevent diversion and meet regulatory compliance requirements. ‘It’s not enough to just put a hologram. What are you putting the holograms on? How do you know it’s going to be secure? Will it solve your problems? Do you know what your problems are? It’s a deeper conversation than just finding a solution itself. There are a lot of solutions out there offered by analog and digital providers.’

Avery Dennison for instance provides a wide range of products both visible and invisible as well as digital-based security methods like RFID and NFC. Finding the right security label always depends on the product itself and the level of security it needs.

For example think of a container of orange juice. Typically over the top of the container is a sticker that is meant to be broken when the consumer opens it. Underneath that top is typically a piece of plastic or aluminum that needs to be peeled off before it can be poured. For this application that level of protection is enough.

But for pharmaceuticals where the risk of counterfeit products could literally mean life or death the approach to protection is vastly different.

A relatively simple yet effective form of security VOID labels leave either a residue or marking to show that the product or packaging has been tampered with

‘Brand protection needs to be looked at on a case-by-case basis. As the price of the item goes up so does the price of the tamper evidence products the brand owners are looking to use’ says Welch. He adds that to ensure a product doesn’t get tampered with or faked a layered approach towards brand protection is required. Utilizing a high-tech singular approach or visible and invisible protection makes it harder for a counterfeiter to figure out exactly what is happening on the label and/or packaging itself thus making it harder to counterfeit.

Gerben van Wjik sales and marketing director at Luminescence Sun Chemical Security a manufacturer of security inks developing custom-made inks that meet the exacting technical requirements needed by its customers shares a similar sentiment.

‘There is no silver bullet when it comes to brand protection. There is no single solution that will completely stop any counterfeiting’ says Wjik. ‘You have to look at the case itself and see where the problem is created – whether it’s at the supply chain level or in the shop level – from here you have to look at what solves your issue.’

Figuring out where the flaws are in one’s security can be a difficult task. But Welch says a layered approach can be a safe bet to ensure that the brand and product are protected. However utilizing just visible or invisible security may not be the best approach.

‘Any time you can have a layered approach to brand protection it’s a good thing’ says Eastman. ‘In that layered approach you should definitely recognize why you’re using each layer of protection and whether they are really complimenting or augmenting each other and not just two features you’ve used just to use them.’

Systech developed e-Fingerprint a product leveraging serialization. It utilizes a camera system installed onto the converting line to inspect and identify any sort of data carrier – such as QE-code to a UPC to a pharmaceutical data matrix – and to find the micro variations which are inherently caused by the printing processes.

‘Within these data carriers there are small micro variations that we can pick up on and create a unique digital identity for each individual unit without printing anything on it. Just leveraging what’s already been printed’ says Eastman.

There are many different means of protecting a company’s brand from counterfeiters but whether it’s a smart system or an analog product due to the nature of the supply chain – especially in its current state – there are going to be breaks. There are going to be moments where cargo is ‘lost’ and these are the spots where counterfeiters will be able to ease their way into the supply chain.

Where protection matters

The brand protection puzzle doesn’t begin and end with an ink a QR code or any digital protection system. There are decisions from the brand owner from the beginning of the lifecycle to its end that need to be made which will ultimately decide whether the product being sold through e-commerce websites or even on the store shelves is legitimate.

‘When thinking about brand protection there are two important aspects that brand owners should think about: why your brand needs protecting and how you should go about protecting it. Because half the battle when it comes to brand protection isn’t just providing security ink it’s about the factory the brands are giving the ink to’ says Tom Mitchell international sales manager at Luminescence Sun Chemical Security.

He adds: ‘if the inks are just given to any factory and not a vetted trusted one then half the counterfeits will just come from the factory next door because sometimes all it takes is one employee and a hundred dollar offer.’

Because of this brand owners need to use a trusted security printer one that specializes in the application it is looking to use. Take for example All4Labels which according to its report is ‘driven by a strong digital attitude and more than 25 years of experience in digital printing reliable cross-market partner to support brand-owners to mitigate their brands’ risk exposure to counterfeit and to increase their sales and customers’ loyalty.’

All4Labels has been investing in the expansion of its intelligent QR technologies and cloud services to provide its customers with a cost-effective and quick product for brand protection and customer interaction on an international scale.

Welch gives the example of wine labeling saying ‘a singular solution could be a neck label on a bottle of spirits that has a smart label to detect if the cap has been tampered with - if the circuit breaks it will say bottle has been opened. This is unique in that there is really one point of entry. It also provides a form of authenticity since a unique idea could be attached to it.’

Layering different forms of protection from inks to holograms to smart features can ensure ample protection of a company’s brand

When looking at the growth of e-commerce and due to the high volume of online retail shopping especially post-Covid brand owners can legitimately be sending their products over to these e-commerce giants but it’s simply impossible for consumers to know whether a product is legitimate until after it hits their doorstep. This is where QR codes and smart labeling can come into play.

Allowing consumers to scan and authenticate the product ensures its legitimacy and while ‘if something is just printed with a QR code its relatively easy to duplicate’ says Welch. ‘A smart label using an embedded NFC inlay can store a unique identifier so difficult to work around the security.’

These security features also allow consumers to engage with the brand helping to garner brand loyalty and up the repurchase rates while ensuring the reputation of a company’s brand.

At the end of the day what is the answer to brand protection?

There is no single answer.

Depending on the product multiple layers of analog and digital protections may be required. For a single product RFID holograms security inks and e-fingerprinting may be the answer. For another a hologram may be all it needs.

According to Welch it is important to ‘invest in a solution that makes financial sense for the product you are selling.’",,,,,,,,,,,,

The COVID-19 pandemic — and its seemingly never-ending aftermath — has been a nightmare for commercial landlords of many different stripes particularly those with significant holdings in retail and traditional office properties.

But in the Boulder Valley and Northern Colorado — especially along the U.S. Highway 36 corridor connecting Denver Broomfield and Boulder — life-sciences and biotechnology companies with a thus-far unquenchable thirst for flex-industrial square footage have kept brokers and builders busy. And with 2023 upon us there’s no sign of a slowdown on the horizon.

While office users who have largely remained in work-from-home or hybrid mode leaving their workplaces underused life-sciences companies are champing at the bit for additional space in the Boulder Valley a market that’s rapidly becoming one of the industry’s leading regions.

“It’s been a very active second half of 2022” BioMed Realty LLC president of West Coast markets Jon Bergschneider told BizWest in an interview this month.

In the Boulder Valley region “you’ve got a great convergence of public and private industry academic [institutions] like the University [of Colorado] venture capital” that combine to spur the growth of the local life-sciences industry along with the real estate development necessary to support that growth Bergschneider said. “It’s a multi-piston engine.”

All told that biotech-related development accounts for “approximately 2.5 million to 3 million square feet of construction … underway or in the pipeline along the Boulder/Denver corridor” according to a recent report from Boulder-based commercial real estate brokerage Dean Callan & Co. When you add proposed projects that have not been fully permitted that square footage total is much higher.

“While office leasing has slowed dramatically life science development is full steam ahead” the report said. New development activity “will be a big boost to attracting more companies to our market and create even more demand for the [research and development] product Boulder provides.”

The biotech explosion in and around Boulder over the last half-decade or so comes as little surprise to local players who have long understood the region to be a technology powerhouse that punches well above its weight.

Erik Abrahamson a senior vice president with CBRE said during BizWest’s Boulder Valley Real Estate Conference held last month that “life science follows tech. We’ve got the tech.”

He said the University of Colorado is producing the “best in the world” graduates in bioscience. Smaller companies have been swallowed up by larger players spreading the seeds of capital and talent to foster new generations of biotech startups.

Mike Ruhl vice president of leasing for BioMed compared the Boulder area to “to what Seattle was 10-15 years ago.”

BioMed which this year bought a roughly 1 million-square-foot portfolio in Flatirons Park for $625 million — the largest real estate deal in Colorado history “look[s] for highly educated markets an influx of venture capital and places with tech already here” he said.

Despite the excitement the biotech industry is not of course entirely without its recent hiccups.

For example Inscripta Inc. a genomic-editing platform born out of the University of Colorado is shuttering its Boulder research and development hub and headquarters in January resulting in mass layoffs for employees at the site.

Meanwhile Clovis Oncology Inc. (Nasdaq: CLVS) defaulted on a loan agreement this month and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

“At a high level there have certainly been some macro issues that face everybody no matter what geography or industry you’re in” Bergschneider said. Those issues unsurprisingly relate mainly to interest rates volatility in capital markets supply-chain disruptions and a prolonged period of tightness in the labor market.

Macroeconomics haven’t slammed the brakes on local biotech developments but they are likely to make things more expensive both for builders and tenants.

“As [development costs] continue to rise rents need to rise in lockstep in order for developments to pencil and for there to be economically acceptable returns for landlords” Bergschneider said.

Still “life-sciences on the whole and Boulder on the whole has held on really well” he said. “We still see a tremendous amount of demand and great fundamentals.”

Observers across organizations remain quite bullish on the overall outlook for the local sector with access to top talent often cited as a particularly attractive asset.

“For me talent is everything. You grow through talent and creating great technology is really all about talent” Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. president Damaris Mills told BizWest this week. “We see Boulder as being this central U.S. hub for a lot of [biotechnology] talent — and increasingly so.”

Iowa-based IDT entered the local biotechnology sphere this month with the $48 million purchase of technology developed by and facilities formerly occupied by Boulder-born ArcherDX Inc. Archer producer of genetic assays for cancer patients was previously acquired in 2020 for $1.4 by California genetics-testing company Invitae Corp. (NYSE: NVTA) which is now facing significant financial turmoil.

“We’re excited about the site and we’re really excited about the talent that’s here on the team and in the broader community” Mills said.

Here are some highlights of life-sciences real estate projects planned in progress or recently completed in that broader Boulder Valley and Northern Colorado community:

Boulder

BioMed purchased Flatiron Park with the express purpose of improving its status as a regional hub for biotech R&D.

“At acquisition about 25% of the park was life-sciences. Our goal is to convert that up to about 50% life-sciences” Bergschneider said. “We’ve always envisioned a multi-faceted ownership model in which we’re appealing both to life-sciences and technology [tenants].”

The conversion process is underway and is expected to take a handful of years to complete.

Meanwhile on nearby Walnut Street Conscience Bay Co. LLC is developing West Meadows a 112423-square-foot building that the company said represents a “significant opportunity for a cutting edge two-story science and technology development.”

Broomfield

Dallas-based investor and developer Mohr Capital LLC is dipping its first toe in the market with plans to build a four-building speculative campus on a vacant parcel next to the Oracle Corp. operation in Broomfield’s Interlocken business park.

“They’ve been looking to get into the market here for a while” said WK Real Estate (Wright-Kingdom Inc.) broker Andrew Freeman who along with representatives from commercial brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (NYSE:JLL) is marketing the project.

Mohr’s plan Freeman told BizWest last month is to build four basically identical “life-science slash industrial-flex buildings” that will total nearly 400000 square feet.

Nearby another Dallas developer Lincoln Property Co. is developing a large new office research and development and light-manufacturing campus in Interlocken with an eye toward biotech tenants.

The project known as CoRE – Colorado Research Exchange will be built at 235 Interlocken Blvd. and is planned to total about 450000 square feet spread across four buildings that will range from about 16000 square feet for the development’s amenities center to nearly 200000 square feet for the largest office building.

Louisville

Redtail Ridge represents a major question mark for Louisville’s life-sciences future.

The project which for years has proved difficult to push across the regulatory finish line could eventually house a 2.6 million-square-foot commercial-only development with a focus on biotechnology facilities on the roughly 400-acre long-vacant former Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX) site off U.S. 36.

However residents and Louisville officials have been thus far unwilling to grant the approvals necessary for Denver-based developer Brue Baukol Capital Partners LLC and partner Sterling Bay LLC to break ground.

Superior

Another controversial life-sciences proposal in the eastern portion of Boulder County is the Coal Creek Innovation Campus in Superior which could add more than 1200 jobs including many in the biotech sector.

The project planned by Superior master builder RC (Ranch Capital) Superior LLC by San Diego health care real estate developer PMB LLC calls for the construction of four buildings totaling more than 366000 square feet.

Coal Creek was approved in September on a controversial split vote of Superior’s Board of Trustees. Residents cried foul petitioned and sued and last month the board repealed its approval leaving the project in development purgatory.

Lafayette

Construction began in 2021 at the site of the new Medtronic corporate campus just south of the SCL Health Good Samaritan Medical Center in Lafayette. Lucas High/BizWest.



Redtail Ridge partner Sterling Bay is transforming a Lafayette Corporate Campus office building formerly leased to Ball Corp. (NYSE: BLL) into a speculative flex space geared toward biotechnology tenants.

The company which bought the Campus Drive property as part of a $74.5 million portfolio acquisition deal in 2021 with developer Etkin Johnson Real Estate Partners intends a roughly 50-50 split between office and laboratory uses for the roughly 52000-square-foot space.

The lab space will be geared toward research and development uses rather than light manufacturing such as pharmaceutical or medical-device production.

Just next door to the Lafayette Corporate Campus Medtronic Inc. is putting the finishing touches on its medical-device research and development hub.

The company will soon consolidate its local business into 400000 square feet of new office and laboratory space spread across two five-story buildings. Of that 60000 square feet will be dedicated to research and development a 10000-square-foot increase over Medtronic’s current R&D footprint in the region.

Frederick

One of the region’s most significant life-science projects isn’t in the Boulder Valley but just a few miles to the north in Frederick.

It’s there that Agilent Technologies Inc. is planning a major expansion at its manufacturing hub.

The project which state officials estimate could cost upward of $784 million could could nearly double Agilent’s Colorado workforce and nearly quadruple its physical footprint in Frederick.

The Santa Clara California-headquartered Agilent began developing its 130000-square-foot manufacturing facility on 20 acres in the Eagle Business Park adjacent to Interstate 25 in 2016.

The company — which according to its website “provides laboratories worldwide with instruments services consumables applications and expertise enabling customers to gain the insights they seek” — also has existing operations in Boulder. All told Agilent employs about 520 workers in Colorado Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade documents show.

“Agilent is planning to expand its existing facility located at the northwest corner of Tipple Parkway [and] Eagle Boulevard” according to a traffic analysis report provided to Frederick planners. “The expansion project is anticipated to add 310000 square feet of manufacturing building 61000 square feet of associated office uses 42000 square feet of warehouse/central utility plant 2000 square feet of drum storage expansion and 10000 square feet of tank farm.”

The expansion which planning documents show is expected to be complete by the end of 2024 would “accommodate approximately 465 additional employees for the Agilent facility.”

Agilent much like it did when the existing Frederick operation was built has turned to public bodies to help subsidize the project. The company expects to receive more than $10 million in incentives for the Northern Colorado expansion.

Loveland

Last year Beckman Coulter Life Sciences began expanding its presence in Loveland with the construction of a new $9 million office at Etkin Johnson Real Estate Partners’ Axis 25 development.

The 95114-square-foot building expected to allow the company to hire 85 more local workers is scheduled for completion in 2024.

“We have been on a rapid growth journey in Loveland since 2018 when we started with nearly three dozen employees” Beckman Coulter Life Sciences president Greg Milosevich said last year in a prepared statement. “Our strong business needs required us to ramp up quickly last year and we’re proud that despite the economic downturn in 2020 we were able to create more than 60 high-paying jobs in Loveland.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlLzIwMjIvMTIvMjYvdGFtcGEtYmF5LXJlYWwtZXN0YXRlLXJha2VkLWJpbGxpb25zLXRoaXMteWVhci1jaGVjay1vdXQtdG9wLXNhbGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tampa Bay real estate raked in billions this year.

The Tampa Bay Times reviewed property records from Hillsborough Pinellas and Pasco counties and found that the 20 highest grossing sales brought in a cumulative total of more than $2 billion.

“Transactions coming in over $100 million dollars 10 years ago that’s not something we’d be talking about” said Danny Rice a market leader overseeing the Central Florida market for real estate firm Collier’s. “It really speaks volumes to where Tampa has matured to.”

Heavy in-migration strong rent growth and a strong job market made the region a prime destination for investors looking to turn a profit. Apartments and multi-family properties were a hot commodity.

The first half of the year was busy. Zach Nolan managing director of JLL Capital Markets in Tampa said 2021 was a record year for sales volume and 2022 was on pace to exceed that.

But by the third quarter the market began to cool.

“With inflation concerns and interest rates going up that really started a pull back from a lot of investors who were just uncertain of where the market was heading” Nolan said.

That trend is likely to carry through to 2023. Still investors remain bullish on Tampa Bay in the long term as property values continue to grow.

While there may be fewer deals overall Rice said buyers are still willing to spend big bucks on Class A properties in dense downtown areas.

Here’s a look back on some of the biggest transactions of 2022.

BofA is offering zero-down-payment zero-closing cost mortgages for minority communities ...,"2008 all over again? BofA is offering zero-down-payment zero-closing cost mortgages for minority communities — heres what you need to know about the pilot program

A pilot program from a major American bank aims to help first-time buyers at a time when high interest rates and low home inventory have stacked the deck against them.

It’s also the latest response to longstanding criticism that banks favor white borrowers.

Bank of America’s test plan has launched in Los Angeles Dallas Detroit and Charlotte and is aimed at predominantly minority neighborhoods in those cities.

It offers loans to eligible buyers without the need for a down payment closing costs or private mortgage insurance (PMI) — an extra cost that’s customary for buyers who put down less than 20% of the home’s purchase price.

Crucially the program also requires no minimum credit score with eligibility focused instead on a borrower’s solid track record of rent payments and regular monthly bills like utilities and phone. Before applying buyers must finish a homebuyer certification course that counsels them on ownership responsibilities and other considerations.

But the move has received mixed responses online as Bank of America (and other large lenders) have been criticized in the past for predatory lending practices — especially when loaning to minority groups.

No money down loans — a timely boost

For buyers in Bank of America’s test cities the loans come at a critical time.

High interest rates have made mortgages more expensive and created downward pressure on lenders to ensure their loans are as risk-averse as possible. Bank of America’s program is meant to break from this by freeing qualified applicants from down payments credit score standards and PMI costs.

That reduces many of the barriers to entry for buyers struggling with institutional lending practices.

“Homeownership strengthens our communities and can help individuals and families to build wealth over time” said AJ Barkley Bank of America’s head of neighborhood and community lending.

Homeownership among white households was 72.1% in 2020 according to the National Association of Realtors — compared to 51.1% for Hispanic households and 43.4% for Black households.

And Black borrowers are denied at twice the rate of the overall borrower pool according to a report from LendingTree.

Story continues

The percentage of Hispanic homebuyers are estimated to climb to 56% by 2030 according to a survey by Maxwell a digital mortgage platform.

But 23% of survey participants said language was a challenge in the mortgage process and 38% said they were unable to find Spanish-speaking lenders in their area.

Bank of America’s plan adds to its $15 billion program that offers closing cost and down payment assistance to lower-income buyers and another initiative aimed at providing $15 billion in mortgages to low- to moderate-income buyers through mid-2027.

The equity risk

However critics of the program point out that it could backfire and potentially harm the communities it’s designed to help.

The 2008 housing crisis — which was heavily driven by risky loans to unqualified buyers — taught tough lessons to lenders who were stuck with foreclosed homes after buyers stopped making payments on properties they were never able to afford.

The consequences were devastating: Lenders inherited foreclosed homes and buyers saw their credit scores sink.

It’s likely that at least some of the borrowers under Bank of America’s new program would be considered “subprime” under ordinary lending rules — recalling the ugliest days of the 2008 crisis and supplying critics with easy talking points. Credit agency Experian for instance considers borrowers with credit scores between 580 and 669 as subprime.

And while credit scores aren’t always an accurate barometer of a buyer’s purchase power or their ability to make timely payments advocates worry the interest rates required to make up for the low bar the lender is setting could set minority buyers up for failure.

For Goff there was added insult in the Lions’ 37-23 loss to the Panthers. The veteran quarterback didn’t like Bank of America Stadium’s field conditions.

""I thought the field conditions were below NFL level standard specifically pregame"" Goff told reporters after the game via the team’s website. ""I don’t know what the deal is here but they need to figure out a way for the turf to not feel like cement.""

Goff was 25-of-42 with 355 passing yards and three touchdown passes. But he was sacked twice and the Panthers delivered seven QB hits.

Field conditions in NFL stadiums have been a topic of conversation. Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte isn’t he only field that’s been blamed for how tough the field is. MetLife Stadium was blamed for multiple knee injuries this season with New York Giants wide receiver Sterling Shepard suffering a torn ACL on a non-contact injury.

The city was founded in the first century by the Romans who used its natural hot springs as a thermal spa. But a dip in those steaming waters in an elaborately engineered underground temple dedicated to Minerva goddess of healing is off limits to visitors who wander through the historic site today.

At the Cleveland Pools however you can once again take the plunge. This equally impressive water complex was built in 1815 and continuously used for bathing until 1984. Following a nearly £10-million restoration the complex believed to be the oldest surviving outdoor public swimming pool in the United Kingdom reopened to the public in the fall. Its main attraction is a large curvilinear pool originally reserved for male bathers who had been banned from swimming nude in the adjacent river.

Cleveland Pools can only be reached on foot through the scenic trails of a quiet residential cul-de-sac which contributes to its somewhat secret status. Travelling there takes you through layers of Saxon medieval and Tudor architecture and most notably neoclassical Palladian buildings constructed during the 18th century under the reign of George III. Accented with honey-coloured limestone pediments and Corinthian pilasters these landmarks give the city its distinctive glow even in the pouring rain.

The direct 90-minute train from London Paddington means that Bath population 100000 sees a significant influx of visitors particularly for weekend getaways. Many of those tourists come to town to experience the waters and the historic cityscape to follow in the literary footsteps of Mary Shelley (who wrote much of her landmark gothic Frankenstein while attending lectures in town) and Jane Austen (who lived here briefly) and to hop between filming locations of Netflix’s blockbuster Regency-era series Bridgerton. Lately the city is also becoming a destination for fans of a branch of contemporary British design that’s anchored in history.

Bath’s influx of weekenders also includes more than a few hen and stag parties which is why during my visit in October I opted to stay in Bathwick. It’s a quiet area on the opposite bank of the River Avon and only a 10-minute stroll across neoclassical Pulteney Bridge from the bustling city centre. I enjoyed coming and going along Great Pulteney Street a wide formal avenue flanked by the unspoiled Georgian architecture of luxurious terraced townhouses.

Open this photo in gallery: Holburne Museum Bath's first public art gallery and former home of Sir Thomas Holburne.

At its east end is the Holburne Museum. Doubling as the stately residence of Bridgerton’s formidable Lady Danbury in real life it’s the onetime home of Sir Thomas Holburne a lifelong collector of quirky miniatures old masters and objets d’art he later bequeathed to the city. A recent exhibition was devoted to painter Gwen John whose reputation only emerged out the imposing shadow of her artist brother Augustus and lover Auguste Rodin after her death in 1939.

Great Pulteney Street is only one of the city’s architectural set pieces. The Circus a round residential street of townhouses from 1754 is another masterpiece of graceful urban planning. Its streetscape overflows ornamentation in the forms of friezes decorative emblems and triglyphs. The curving Palladian façades of nearby Royal Crescent overlook the vast Royal Victoria Park lawn. Among them No. 1 is the city’s most prestigious address housing a museum styled entirely in the Georgian manner (and doubling as another Bridgerton backdrop the Featherington family’s abode).

The Assembly Rooms referenced by Austen was one of the legendary dance halls at the heart of aristocratic socializing in her day and it still drips with crystal chandeliers and ornate mouldings. During a visit you can practically hear the gossiping ghosts of socialites past. At the nearby Jane Austen Centre those ghosts are in fact real-life guides costumed in Regency garb who lead tours in character.

All this history – and occasional kitsch – forms the groundwork for the contemporary designers galleries and quirky shops that draw on the city’s heritage values. Nowhere is this more in evidence than at the influential design boutique Berdoulat. Based in Margaret’s Buildings a historic pedestrian street lined with independent design shops Berdoulat is Patrick Williams’s architectural design practice which specializes in period building restoration. It’s also the three-storey Georgian shopfront he co-founded with his wife Turkish and Bulgarian photographer Neri Williams.

The wood countertops brass scales and antique apothecary jars are heirlooms just as Berdoulat’s many tableware and interior accessory collaborations with local artisans will eventually become. From cutlery baskets by Bath’s Willow pottery to canelé-shaped ceiling fixtures by Devon ceramicist Feldspar all its pieces are designed in collaboration with regional makers. The simple refectory tables lipped bowls and oak egg racks highlight craft and epitomize beautility the latest buzzword for functional home essentials in modest materials.

As someone who thrills at the archaic terminology of estate interiors – think “boot rooms” “butler’s pantries” and anything featuring the word “scullery” – the new DeVOL Kitchens showroom tucked in the corner of a historic building block nearby is a twofold pleasure. The firm specializes in (and popularized) handmade kitchen furniture inspired by historic home aesthetics that fuse classic unfitted Georgian and farmhouse styles with modern conveniences. The copper worktops Shaker wainscotting aged brass taps slatted plate racks and fluted marble bib sinks of the three atmospheric showroom kitchens are swoon-worthy – and could easily have been plucked out of any of the high-ceilinged townhouses on the street.

Niche bookshop and publisher Persephone Books sits next door in the Edgar Buildings. It was established 25 years ago to excavate a more recent history: neglected works (mostly by women) from the mid-20th century. As much as I adore Austen Persephone is the reason I’ve come to Bath: a pilgrimage to the bookshop that has unearthed so many of my favourite reads. The publisher’s attention to design detail rivals that of its neighbours. The vestibule and fixtures are done up in the same signature dove grey as its books each with individual endpapers reproducing period textiles and wallpapers chosen to complement the material. A period upholstery fabric for example lines an edition of the once-forgotten 1938 charmer Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day by Winifred Watson that is Persephone’s perennial bestseller.

Among the cluster of well-curated art and antique shops up the hill Francis Gallery is set inside another of these heritage-listed Georgian townhouses with wood furnishings and plinths in tonal shades of ecru arranged like a living space. Korean-Canadian founder and director Rosa Park grew up in Vancouver. Prior to opening the gallery (which also has an outpost in Los Angeles) to present the work of emerging international artists she created Cereal an acclaimed indie magazine about travel and lifestyle. The space is as warm and understated as her magazine pages with diffused lighting like something out of a Hammershøi painting adding to the moodiness of the ghostly Krista Mezzadri monotype prints on show when I visited.

Retracing my steps to explore an area around the railway station I took the invigorating waters of a different kind at Bath Botanical Gin Distillery & Herbal Apothecary the passion project of medical herbalist Sue Mullett. As a one-woman operation its hours are limited but I stopped by at just the right time to sample the micro-distillery’s offerings of boozy small-batch tonics inspired by traditional apothecary tinctures. Mullett’s crisply refreshing No.1 Gin is the only authentically Bath-produced gin and every wax-sealed bottle comes out of the copper still that is the petite room’s centrepiece. It is yet another example of how Bath’s modern sense of craft and culture flourishes because of the reverence for the city’s history.

Prop Du Toit scooped the ball up before forcing his way over with Finn Russell adding the conversion.

Nine minutes later Bath scored again but this time it needed checking. Du Toit fell short of the line but the ball found Spencer. The officials looked to see if there was a knock-on in the build-up but the try stood and was converted from close range.

Bath looked to be running away with it when Cokanasiga powered over in the right corner on 28 minutes before another Russell conversion.

The Falcons got on the board when Blamire forced himself over the line following a superb maul near the corner but Brett Connon's conversion fell just short.

Gallagher scythed through the Newcastle defence on 38 minutes and secured a bonus point with another converted try.

Blamire responded to end the half with his second following another driving maul. Again Connon failed to convert.

The frenetic pace to the match did not cease after the break; Newcastle were not letting go of the slim chance of a first victory in over a year and their scrum which had been dominant all night maintained their foothold in the game.

Stuart's try came after another strong drive as Newcastle made their superior territory and possession count.

In truth Bath's discipline gave Newcastle hope of a comeback as the latter stages were littered with penalties but they managed to hold on for the win.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyY2hkYWlseS5jb20vMTAxNjI5Ny9qb2NoZW9uLXlva2phbmctYmF0aC1hdGVsaWVyLWl0Y2jSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jocheon Yokjang Bath / Atelier ITCH,"+ 24

Text description provided by the architects. Jocheon is a small village on the northeastern coast of Jeju. It is a seaside village known as a great place to see the sunrise every day. To the north is the blue sea of Jocheon and freshwater springs from the ground near the beach. Jocheon has been a clean and abundant village with clean spring water which was used by the people for washing and drinking before the waterworks were installed. This plot of land silently watching over the sea is about 18 square meters in size and is on the boundary between the beach of Jocheon and the freshwater springs.

This was a place for the travelers to begin and end their day. So what did it have to offer? We focused on the element of ‘water’ as harbored by the beach of Jocheon. We wanted the most daily element to give the most non-daily experience in this space. ‘Taking a bath’ is a very simple and daily action yet a powerful ritual of rearranging one’s mind and relieving the physical and mental fatigue. The Chinese character for bath is 浴 (Yok).

It represents the pouring water and means to clean the wastes with the force of water flowing downwards. We planned this space to be a place for relaxing and recharging focusing on the acts of washing and wiping in a space filled with various forms of water such as pouring water gushing water still water gazing water and steam.

The Jocheon Yokjang is a small bath place consisting of 3 floors that are about 15 square meters each. The building was designed to be within 50 square meters without a parking area so that the yard can be used more widely and it is a private space for only 2 people. The 3rd floor is a bathing space with an ocean view and various washing experiences. The 2nd floor is the bedroom and the 1st floor is the kitchen. The vertical concrete building is only open on the sides that come in contact with nature.

Only the surfaces that accept the ocean view and light are open and all other surfaces are completely shut from the outer world. The concrete walls have wood grain patterns that hold the movement of light. Along the basalt wall is the entrance path that opens into the garden and through the garden is the inside of the house. The entrance path is long enough to heighten the immersion in the space and the unpredictable changes of the space diversify the experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL2RyYWItcmVudGFsLWJhdGhyb29tLW1ha2VvdmVyLTM3Mzk3ODI00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An $800 Rental Bath Makeover Goes from “Drab” to Fab,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.apartmenttherapy.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /drab-rental-bathroom-makeover-37397824 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021226F22470>, 'Connection to www.apartmenttherapy.com timed out.

Sale Sharks heaped pressure on Bristol Bears Saracens and Harlequins with a deserved bonus-point 31-22 victory over Leicester Tigers as Alex Sanderson’s side continued their attacking rebirth to move into the Gallagher Premiership play-off places.

In almost certainly Sale’s last home game of the season club stalwart Sam James had the fairytale ending before departing in the summer as he scored an immensely popular try and also set up Tom O’Flaherty’s bonus-point score with a sumptuous kick.

Early tries from Gus Warr and Tommy Taylor helped condemn Leicester to a pointless defeat as they chase Investec Champions Cup qualification for next season.

Dan Cole Matt Scott and George Martin crossed for Dan McKellar’s side but they were distinctly second-best as familiar face Manu Tuilagi also ran riot on his final home game for Sale too.

A good night was made even better for Sale fans when director of rugby Sanderson announced in a TNT Sports interview after the game that he had signed a three-year contract extension.

Tigers will be relying on Hollywoodbets Sharks beating Gloucester in the EPCR Challenge Cup final to secure the final English Champions Cup spot for next season.

Bath also continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle Falcons securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

Leicester got off to the stronger start when veteran prop Dan Cole charged over the try line inside five minutes but the lead lasted only five minutes before a huge carry from Tuilagi put the Tigers defence on the back foot before Warr weaved his way over the line from close range.

To make matters worse Ollie Hassell-Collins was sent to the sin bin for a high shot when bringing down the barnstorming Tuilagi and Sale cashed in on their numerical advantage when Tommy Taylor finished off another neat lineout move a second successful conversion putting Sale 14-5 up.

An action-packed opening quarter continued to deliver the goods when Scott’s interception try narrowed the gap to two points.

The most celebrated score of the night arrived just before the break when James in his final home game for his boyhood club finished a fine team move to extend the hosts’ lead once more.

And the full-back was again instrumental for the crucial bonus-point score early in the second half sending a clever grubber kick through for O’Flaherty to gather and dive over in the corner.

Leicester’s resistance waned from then on Ford adding a penalty to further extend the lead and a consolation score from Martin in the closing minutes did little to spring any serious hopes of a comeback.

Bath go joint-top with Newcastle win

Bath continued their charge for the play-offs against Newcastle securing the bonus point in a rampant first half before holding off a late home comeback to move up to second place in the table with a 28-17 victory.

With creative hub Finn Russell back in the side following an injury  the visitors got off to a strong start Thomas du Toit reacting quickest to a loose ball to dot down the opening try after five minutes.

Scores from Ben Spencer and Joe Cokanasiga before the half-hour mark had Bath in cruise control but a frantic first half still had plenty to offer as Jamie Blamire crossed twice for Newcastle either side of Matt Gallagher’s bonus point-securing try for Bath to send the sides in at 28-10 at the break.

The second half was far less eventful with just one score to show for it Sam Stuart narrowing the gap with a third Falcons try but it was not enough to spark an unlikely fightback.

(WCSC) - Thousands of people across the United States have had their travel plans put on pause especially folks flying with Southwest Airlines. More than two-thirds of their flights were cancelled as of 6 p.m. Monday with airline officials blaming it on the weekend storms.

“We got to the airport and of course total pandemonium” Kevin Ulmet who traveled from Nashville to Charleston said.

Paul Strebe says he needs to get to Chicago for a connecting flight.

“Ultimately get back to Wisconsin and as of right now it’s not looking like we’re going to get up there at all” Strebe said.

Southwest Airlines has cancelled 70% and delayed 16% of their flights Monday according to FlightAware. This includes some stranded passengers at Charleston International Airport who say they have been unable to get through to their customer service line and are left with little communication.

“Pretty much the only communication we got was a text message that said the flight was cancelled” Strebe said.

Desmond Baxter says he’s trying to get back to Dallas and didn’t even know his flight was cancelled.

“There was no notification made of my flight being cancelled” Baxter said. “So me and the rest of the hundreds of people that showed up expecting to get on a flight and then it was cancelled with no notifications.”

Another passenger says he never got a notification of his cancelled flight to Houston but instead a marketing promotion.

“One of the questions that was posed was those individuals that already boarded or have their luggage secured on the aircraft how would they get it?” Baxter said.

Ulmet says he waited more than two hours to have that question answered.

“Doesn’t look like there’s any resolution” Ulmet said. “They don’t know when the luggage is going to be here. When the flights will come through. So it’s a glorious vacation the week after Christmas.”

Some Southwest employees who did not agree to be on camera say the company is going to have to play catch up for days just trying to make up for all these flights.

Southwest put out this statement:

With consecutive days of extreme winter weather across our network behind us continuing challenges are impacting our Customers and Employees in a significant way that is unacceptable.

And our heartfelt apologies for this are just beginning.

We’re working with Safety at the forefront to urgently address wide-scale disruption by rebalancing the airline and repositioning Crews and our fleet ultimately to best serve all who plan to travel with us.

We were fully staffed and prepared for the approaching holiday weekend when the severe weather swept across the continent where Southwest is the largest carrier in 23 of the top 25 travel markets in the U.S. These operational conditions forced daily changes to our flight schedule at a volume and magnitude that still has the tools our teams use to recover the airline operating at capacity.

This safety-first work is intentional ongoing and necessary to return to normal reliability one that minimizes last-minute inconveniences. We anticipate additional changes with an already reduced level of flights as we approach the coming New Year holiday travel period. And we’re working to reach to Customers whose travel plans will change with specific information and their available options.

Our Employees and Crews scheduled to work this holiday season are showing up in every single way. We are beyond grateful for that. Our shared goal is to take care of every single Customer with the Hospitality and Heart for which we’re known.

On the other side of this we’ll work to make things right for those we’ve let down including our Employees.

With no concern higher than ultimate Safety the People of Southwest share a goal to take care of each and every Customer. We recognize falling short and sincerely apologize.

As for those traveling Southwest Baxter says he’s done.

“This will be my first and last time but I haven’t made it on the aircraft so it won’t be any time” Baxter said.

Ulmet says it could be worse.

“So nobody can help it” Ulmet said. “I mean it is what it is. And there’s not many better places to be than Charleston if you’re going to be in this situation. But now I need to find a hotel room.”

Baxter says he had to buy a $1300 one-way ticket through a different airline just to get out of here. Others say they will now be driving 10 plus hours instead of flying to their destination.

The trio of recruits – Aekash Singh Jaskirat Singh and Milaap Singh Chahal – had sought an exemption from a Marines grooming rule requiring them to shave their beards with the men arguing it was their expression of commitment to their religious faith.

The Marine Corps told three Sikh men that they could serve only if they shaved before going through basic training.

They appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit in September after a lower-court judge denied their request for a preliminary injunction that would have allowed them to enter basic training with their articles of faith.

They are now suffering and will continue to suffer grave immediate and ongoing injuries to the exercise of their faith the three-judge bench of the US Court of Appeals in Washington ruled on Friday (December 23).

“A federal court has just ruled that Sikhs can maintain their religious beards while serving their country in the U.S. Marine Corps. Now three Sikh recruits who had previously been denied religious accommodations can enter basic training” lawyer Eric Baxter who represented the three men tweeted.

“This is a major ruling for religious freedom for years the Marine Corps has barred Sikh recruits with religious beards from entry into basic training. Today’s ruling strikes down that rule as a “violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA)” he said.

“No one should have to choose between serving God and country” he added in a series of tweets.

The Marines’ ban on facial hair applies in basic training and combat zones a designation the plaintiffs said in court covers over three dozen countries where hazard pay is given the Washington Post newspaper reported.

The Marines claimed that beards will impact “troop uniformity” and appearance among recruits ultimately threatening national security.

Writing for the Court Judge Millett stated that the Sikh recruits “not only have a substantial likelihood of success on the merits – is difficult to imagine them losing”.

She noted that the Marine Corps has never explained why the Corps cannot apply the same or similar [religious] accommodations that the Army Navy and Air Force and Coast Guard provide Baxter said.

The US Army Navy Air Force and Coast Guard all accommodate the religious requirements of Sikhism.

In the Sikh religion it is mandatory for the male adherents to not trim their hair and beard along with keeping kanga (wooden comb) kirpan (small sword) kara (steel bracelet) and a white cotton undergarment (kachera).

“Sikhs have a long tradition of serving in militaries around the globe motivated by their religious teaching to defend the defenseless. We are grateful that these Sikh recruits can continue that tradition the ruling was made right in time for them to enter boot camp” Baxter tweeted.

They believe as part of their religious duty in defending the rights of others” Baxter told National Public Radio (NPR).

This was also a win for our national security. At a time of historic recruiting shortfalls the Marines now have access to a new community of Americans who have a history of bravely serving in the military he tweeted.

The Marine Corps allows medically required beards and diverse hairstyles for women and has relaxed its rules around tattoos.

In 2021 NPR reported that the Marines planned to address its lack of diversity and retention problems. Approximately 75% of Marines leave at the end of their four-year term the highest turnover rate among the military services according to the article.

The ruling means that the three men are allowed to go ahead with training while the Marine Corps considers a possible appeal.

“They should really just recognize its time to make this change and let all Americans serve without having to abandon their religious – their core religious belief” Baxter said.",,,,,,

It might not seem like it at the moment but 2022 has been a blessing in disguise for long-term investors.

Even though the 2022 bear market has delivered some painful unrealized losses over a short time frame the stock market has demonstrated time and again that it increases in value over the long run. This makes every correction crash and bear market an opportune time to pounce.

Time can be an especially strong ally for investors when they hold stakes in game-changing businesses. What follows are five surefire stocks that can help build generational wealth over the next 20 years.

Visa

Let's get one thing straight: Large-cap stocks can still deliver big-time returns. One such winner that can keep on winning for its shareholders is payment processor Visa (V 0.79%).

In terms of credit card network market share by purchase volume Visa is in a class of its own in the United States. It held a 54% share in 2020 and was the only one of the four major U.S. payment processors to substantially expand its market share following the Great Recession (2007-2009).

However there's more to Visa than just sitting in the pole position in the No. 1 market for consumption in the world. With most global transactions still being facilitated with cash Visa can organically enter underbanked markets as well as use its deep pockets to make acquisitions in order to expand its reach. It did this in 2016 with the purchase of Visa Europe.

But what makes Visa truly rock-solid is its laser focus on payment processing. Although some of its processing peers act as lenders Visa has chosen not to. This decision means it avoids loan loss responsibility when inevitable recessions arise. Not having to set aside asset reserves to cover potential loan losses is a powerful tool that keeps Visa's margins juiced and allows it to rebound from economic downturns quicker than most financial stocks.

CrowdStrike Holdings

A second game-changing stock with the ability to make patient investors a whole lot richer over the next two decades is cybersecurity company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD 0.89%).

From a macro perspective cybersecurity has shifted from an optional service to an absolute necessity for businesses of all sizes. The COVID-19 pandemic taught businesses the importance of having an online presence and they've responded by moving their data online and into the cloud. As time passes the onus of protecting this data falls evermore onto the laps of third-party providers like CrowdStrike.

While its new customer growth has been impressive -- from 450 subscribers to 21146 in under six years -- what's considerably more important is the organic growth from existing customers. Whereas only a single-digit percentage of subscribers purchased at least four cloud-module subscriptions six years ago 60% of its 21146 clients have purchased at least five cloud-module subscriptions as of the recent quarter. Add-on subscription sales is CrowdStrike's key to jaw-dropping profit growth.

Credit is also due to the company's end-user security platform known as Falcon. This is a platform that relies on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to become more efficient at spotting and responding to potential threats. It's clearly doing its job as evidenced by CrowdStrike's slow but steady climb in gross retention.

Nio

The third surefire stock with generational wealth-building potential over a 20-year time frame is China-based electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Nio (NIO -4.88%).

Similar to CrowdStrike there's a macro thesis at play that very much favors Nio (and its peers). Since most developed countries want to reduce their carbon footprint promoting EVs and other clean-energy modes of transportation is a no-brainer solution. Given that China is the No. 1 auto market in the world we could be talking about a multidecade vehicle-replacement cycle that drives above-average growth for Nio.

For its part Nio has responded by introducing more than a half-dozen models of varying price points. The ET7 and ET5 sedans which respectively began deliveries in late March and September of this year have been especially popular. Nearly 44% of Nio's record 14178 EV deliveries in November were sedans. Look for this model diversification to really drive delivery and sales growth for the company.

Nio also has a good chance to retain the loyalty of its early EV buyers thanks to its battery-as-a-service (BaaS) subscription. Although enrollment in BaaS nets buyers a discount on the purchase price of a Nio EV it more importantly allows Nio to receive high-margin recurring revenue from buyers. This should help keep them loyal to the Nio brand.

Fiverr International

A fourth phenomenal company that's fully capable of building generational wealth in 20 years is gig economy up-and-comer Fiverr International (FVRR 4.95%).

Fiverr operates an online marketplace for freelancers that provides three distinct tailwinds for the company. To begin with the pandemic has resulted in more people than ever working remotely. This looks to be a permanent labor force shift which would favor Fiverr's online-services marketplace model.

Second Fiverr's online marketplace brings differentiation to the table that buyers of freelancer services clearly appreciate. Specifically Fiverr's freelancer marketplace presents jobs at an all-inclusive price as opposed to the hourly rates found on competing online-service marketplaces. Considering that both the aggregate number of buyers on Fiverr and spend per buyer have continued to climb the takeaway is that price transparency is incredibly important.

And third Fiverr's take-rate is unmatched. By ""take-rate"" I'm talking about the percentage of each deal negotiated on its platform that it gets to keep. Fiverr's take-rate hit an all-time high of 30% in the third quarter. The company has consistently grown its freelancer and buyer community despite netting a larger percentage of each deal over time. That's a recipe for substantial long-term growth.

Berkshire Hathaway

The fifth and final surefire stock that can build generational wealth in 20 years is none other than conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.00%) (BRK.B 0.79%).

While Berkshire Hathaway isn't exactly a household name its billionaire CEO for the past 57 years certainly is. Since taking the reins in 1965 Warren Buffett has led his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) to an average annual return of 20.1% through Dec. 31 2021. At this rate of return shareholders have been doubling their money on average every 3.6 years for more than a half-century.

One of the reasons Berkshire Hathaway is such a successful company is because Warren Buffett and his investment team packed the investment portfolio with cyclical stocks. The Oracle of Omaha is well aware that timing the stock market is impossible. Instead he invests in businesses that can take advantage of long-winded periods of expansion. Ultimately economic expansions last considerably longer than recessions/contractions.

The other key factor to Berkshire's outperformance is dividend stocks. More than 30 of the roughly four dozen securities held in Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio offer a payout. All told Buffett's company is in line to collect more than $6 billion in dividend income in 2023. Dividend stocks have a rich history of outperforming their non-paying peers which makes them a smart choice for an investor with a long-term mindset like Warren Buffett.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93YXJyZW4tYnVmZmV0dHMtZmF2b3JpdGUtaG91c2luZy1tZXRyaWMtMTY0OTEyNDgzLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett's Favorite Housing Metric Just Flashed A Major Signal: What To Watch In The Housing Market,"Berkshire Hathaway Inc CEO Warren Buffett once explained one of the metrics he watches for a reversal in the housing market is a reduction of housing starts.

The Oracle of Omaha said in 2010 that sometimes a “bad number” for housing starts is a good thing for the market — in this case he was referencing a cool housing market in which supply outstripped demand. The only way to solve that was to create more demand than supply by reducing the number of newly built homes.

While the macro situation affecting the housing market today is almost the opposite the main idea from the Oracle of Omaha still stands and that key metric ticked down again this month.

What Happened: As a result of consumers being turned off by high mortgage rates and builders being compelled to cut back construction on new homes decreased 0.5% from October and this trend is expected to continue through 2023.

U.S. housing starts slowed to an annual pace of 1.427 million last month from 1.43 million in October and 1.49 million in September. Single-family housing starts dropped 4.1% to a rate of 828000 while the rate for units in buildings with five units jumped 4.8% to 584000.

Compared to November 2021 housing starts fell 8.8%.

Additionally the number of permits which indicates how many homes will likely be built in the coming months decreased drastically from a record 1.9 million last December by nearly 29%% to a rate of 1.35 million.

Why It Matters: Despite the housing shortage which some experts estimate to be between 2 million and nearly 6 million newly built homes fewer individuals can now afford to buy a home.

Home prices are just starting to come down from record highs and 6.51% average 30-year fixed mortgage rates inflict a burden on buyers that directly affects new construction.

What’s Next? According to Moody's Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi prices will decline nationwide by around 10% from peak to trough bottoming out in the summer of 2023.

Pandemic-era hotspots like Phoenix and Boise which saw the highest price spikes should see additional price declines.

Prices in those areas could decrease by as much as 20% according to Zandi.

Instead of trying to time the market many investors are using this strategy to buy shares of individual rental properties with as little as $100 and earn passive income through all market cycles.

Akre,"Because learning from the best allows you to excel here is a new series of articles on legendary investors those who have made history with their vision their approach and their performance. Let's start with Charles T. Akre the founder of Akre Capital Management.

Charles T. Akre known as ""Chuck"" to those in the know founded Akre Capital Management in 1989 after spending 21 years in the securities industry at Johnston Lemon & Co. where he managed various parts of the business including branch office management research and asset management.

From June 1993 Chuck co-managed Akre Capital Management under Friedman Billings and Ramsey before taking over the lead in 2000 when he moved the company to the rural village of Middleburg Virginia away from the frenzy of Wall Street much like Warren Buffett who moved to Omaha.

Today Akre Capital Management has become a highly regarded and recognized asset management firm with now $15 billion in assets in private partnerships mutual funds (the Akre Focus Fund) and separately managed accounts. The portfolio managers of the Akre Focus Fund (whose management composition and performance we will detail) are Mr. John Neff and Mr. Chris Cerrone.

Chuck Akre and Warren Buffett

Chuck Akre has been largely influenced by the writings of Warren Buffett and in particular his perception of shareholder value creation. Warren Buffett believes that every company has a value determined by its financial statements and his goal has always been to buy profitable companies below their intrinsic value. These companies are ultimately identified by their high returns on assets and capital. When these high returns appear Buffett argues that there is some sort of economic royalty and that the value of the company is far greater than what the balance sheet reveals. Chuck reasons in the same way focusing on the growth of the company's book value and cash flow. This means finding highly profitable businesses with the right capital allocation to reinvest the money generated over the course of the year to continue to grow and increase the value of the business.

The management team led by Chuck looks for companies that can perform in any macroeconomic environment. They make few investment decisions each year. They prefer to take time to form an opinion and understand the quality of the company. It can sometimes take years to analyze a business.

Akre has personally invested alongside Warren Buffett. He bought about 40 shares of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) in 1977 - when he was a young broker - for $120. The stock is now worth 3928 times what he paid at the time. Unfortunately for him he sold 39 of his 40 shares at $500 to finance a conversion project and get into real estate sometime in the 1980s. That $19500 would have become more than $18 million today.

Fortunately for him he has had many other successes. Take American Tower (AMT) one of the most successful real estate ventures in the United States in the last 20 years. Chuck took a stake in its IPO following its spin-off from American Radio in 1998. He paid about 80 cents for his AMT shares. The stock is now trading around $230.

Investment Philosophy

Chuck and his firm Akre Capital Management's investment philosophy is based on compound interest (the power of compounding). To understand it I'll tell you the story of the Native Americans selling the island of Manhattan.

The story goes that the selling party in the transaction which took place in 1626 collected beads and trinkets worth an estimated $20. Let's assume that the sellers invested their initial $20 at a rate of 9% per year and maintained that investment program for the next 380 years.

Today their initial $20 would be worth more than $3335000000000000000.

This example shows us that the rate of return on an investment does not have to be extraordinary to produce extraordinary results. What is crucial is to have the ability to maintain an investment program without interruption over a very long period of time. In the real world of investing life sometimes gets in the way. It is rare that an investor can enjoy decades of compounding in an investment without being interrupted by the need to sell positions in order to finance a project or a real estate purchase (and thus pay taxes on their capital gains). This story is simply a reminder that the pursuit of sustained uninterrupted compounded returns over long periods of time is smart investing and that is precisely what Akre is all about.

Many people consider Akre's teams to be ""value investors"" while others wonder if they are ""growth investors"". However in any investment thesis there is an expected value at a certain time horizon and a projected growth expected. Trying to permanently oppose the two is illusory and limiting. And by the way Akre's teams claim to be on neither side. They are compound investors which means that they try to invest in companies that have the ability to generate compound interest over several years. Thinking like a compounding investor is very natural for private investors corporate executives or business angels with a long-term vision. The owner wants to focus carefully on a few business investments and hopes that the accountants will report regularly at the end of each year that the equity per share has increased. It does not think about trying to move investments in and out on a daily or monthly basis. It buys and holds.

This approach is so fundamental but it is often overlooked. it has become all too easy to get distracted by hour-to-hour market fluctuations and all the macro-economic turmoil with short-term news. To be a compounding investor you have to tune out the short-term noise.

Yet in the real world companies change. So you have to be constantly vigilant about those changes. Some companies deteriorate over the years while others improve and Akre's investment portfolio therefore evolves progressively.

A different process

The management teams invest in a small number of companies that they consider extraordinary and that are led by talented and honest managers who reinvest free cash flow wisely. Their investment objective is to ""compound"" investors' capital at above-average rates of return over extended periods of time while incurring a below-average level of risk.

Just as a good recipe requires good ingredients Akre's management teams have been looking at the essential ingredients for a company to create value.

These key ingredients are :

An ability to generate above-average returns on shareholder capital

Opportunities to deploy additional capital at above-average returns

A management team with the skills and judgment to sustain the capitalization process over a long period of time in a competitive environment

They called this triptych ""the three-legged stool"". This metaphor describes what they look for in an investment:

An extraordinary company

Talented management

Great reinvestment opportunities

A track record of investment success

Chuck has an old three-foot milking stool that he stores in the conference room of Akre's Middleburg building. Clearly three legs are both essential (two legs are a downer) and sufficient (the fourth leg is optional).

Asset management at Akre Capital is different in two main ways:

First their decision to buy or sell a company's stock is based on the same fundamental criteria. They do not set sales price targets when buying a stock because they do not seek to trade stocks simply on the basis of their price performance. Rather they seek to compound the capital they manage and initiate sales discussions when one or more of the legs of the stool are ""broken.""

Their track record over the years proves them right.

Second Wall Street's obsession with what fund managers call the ""beat by a penny miss by a penny"" syndrome often gives them the opportunity to make investments at attractive valuations. They focus on the growth in underlying economic value per share - often defined as book value per share - over time. Their time horizon is set at five or ten years and quarterly ""misses"" often create opportunities for the capital they manage.

Most investors seek information about companies by reading annual reports attending trade shows meeting with management and studying key financial metrics. For many their investment theses closely follow management's rhetoric and are fooled by colorful company presentations and complex but highly uncertain financial models.

Their approach instead emphasizes the importance of wisdom by subtraction. They strive to get beyond the non-essential details and ignore the often deafening noise. They want to identify the ""essence"" the substance of each company to understand their true business model and their competitive advantages.

I invite you to practice this if you are a long-term investor. It is a difficult process but the rewards are worth it. Once armed with this deep understanding you can focus on what really matters and not be too alarmed about what doesn't. Quarterly reports or Fed minutes for example become much less of an ""event"" all of a sudden. I really appreciate this long term approach and that's why I wanted to focus on Akre Capital Management.

Coming back to the investment process (called ""the three-legged stool"") let's go into detail about the three steps. These three steps allow us to filter (Charlie Munger-style logic of subtraction) almost all listed companies so that only companies qualified as ""extraordinary"" remain.

Business model filter: The management team looks for companies with (1) high consistent and predictable free cash flow generation and return on equity (ROE); (2) identified sustainable competitive advantages; (3) pricing power above costs (which is a protection against inflation); (4) a business model that is easy to understand by avoiding over-regulated companies; (5) having a strong balance sheet (low debt and low cost of debt).

Management filter: The management team looks for companies with (6) a competent honest and passionate management team (7) that treat shareholders as partners and (8) that are not too preoccupied by the will of Wall Street; (9) a corporate culture that fosters accountability and independence of mind; and (10) rational compensation packages.

Akre Capital Management's portfolio

Akre's teams manage a concentrated portfolio (Akre Focus Fund) with a low turnover. The portfolio is focused where warranted and positions are weighted according to confidence in the investment thesis.

It is comprised of 19 stocks but the top 10 positions account for nearly 74% of the portfolio and has significant exposure to technology (42.8%) financials (21.4%) real estate (11.3%) and consumer discretionary (10.7%).

Here are their ""Top 10 holdings"" the ten companies for which they have the greatest conviction in terms of quality business risk reinvestment opportunity and valuation

They also auction over 500 vehicles weekly with their main car auction being held every Monday starting with the auctioning of inoperative vehicles beginning at 2:30 PM.

Buying The Best Cars at the Best Prices

The automotive marketplace is a vast space filled with many manufacturers each pumping out potentially dozens of different vehicles every single year. As a result when buying an automobile at an auto auction it can be difficult to know what to get and where to get it.

Thankfully after reading this article you should now be familiar with some of the best automobiles on the market and some of the best auto auctions to buy them at.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzI2L2RheS1hZnRlci1jaHJpc3RtYXMtc2FsZXMtc3RvcmUtaG91cnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart after Christmas sale hours: When Target Lowe's Best Buy open,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2022/12/26/day-after-christmas-sales-store-hours on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzI2L2RheS1hZnRlci1jaHJpc3RtYXMtc2FsZXMtc3RvcmUtaG91cnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

It’s that time again. As 2022 has come and (almost) gone it’s time to look back at the exciting grants and surprising denials of certiorari petitions involving patent and trademark matters by the Supreme Court of the United States and what to look forward to from the Court in 2023.

Exciting Grants

In 2022 the Supreme Court docket was relatively light on intellectual property matters. After numerous denials of some highly anticipated patent and trademark cases the Court kept us in suspense by granting certiorari in new cases in November 2022.

The Court granted the certiorari petition in Amgen Inc. Petitioner v. Sanofi on November 4 2022. The question granted for the Court’s review is “Whether enablement is governed by the statutory requirement that the specification teach those skilled in the art to ‘make and use’ the claimed invention 35 U.S.C. §112 or whether it must instead enable those skilled in the art ‘to reach the full scope of claimed embodiments’ without undue experimentation—i.e. to cumulatively identify and make all or nearly all embodiments of the invention without substantial ‘time and effort’.” The technology at issue involves a pair of patents directed to an isolated monoclonal antibody owned by Amgen. The Federal Circuit found the language in the claims lacked enablement (e.g. claim 1 recites: “An isolated monoclonal antibody wherein when bound to PCSK9 the monoclonal antibody binds to at least one of the following residues: … and wherein the monoclonal antibody blocks binding of PCSK9 to LDLR.”). The Federal Circuit’s reasoning was that enablement for claims that recite functional limitations requires the consideration of the amount of experimentation required to make and use the full scope of the claimed invention.

The Solicitor General briefed the government’s position to the Court recommending that the Court not grant certiorari in this case. Surprising many the Court opted to grant the petition despite the Solicitor General’s recommendation. Ultimately the Court will need to strike a balance between giving patent holders the flexibility in their claim language to avoid minor modifications by a potential infringer while also not giving the patent holder broad claim scope that would impede future innovation.

The Court also granted certiorari in Abitron Austria GmbH Petitioner v. Hetronic International Inc. on November 4 2022. The question presented to the Court is whether the court of appeals erred in applying the Lanham Act extraterritorially to Abitron’s foreign sales in foreign countries by foreign sellers to foreign customers for use in foreign countries that never reached the U.S. or confused U.S. consumers. At the circuit court level the Lanham Act was held to apply extraterritorially whenever a foreign defendants’ conduct abroad effectively diverts foreign sales from a U.S. plaintiff based on the rationale that reducing foreign sales and revenue affects U.S. commerce. Notably the Solicitor General’s brief encouraged the Court to grant certiorari of this petition.

Jack Daniel’s petition for certiorari was also granted in Jack Daniel’s Properties Inc. Petitioner v. VIP Products LLC on November 21 2022. VIP Products sells dog toys that resemble the square-shape of a Jack Daniels Old No. 7 whiskey bottle; however instead of “Jack Daniels” the bottle-shaped dog toy reads “Bad Spaniels”. The lower court found that VIP’s dog toys would likely confuse consumers infringed Jack Daniel’s marks and tarnished Jack Daniel’s reputation. This was reversed at the circuit court which held that VIP had a First Amendment interest in using the Jack Daniel’s marks on their dog toys and rendered the dog toy products “noncommercial” and exempt from dilution-by-tarnishment claims. The Court granted Jack Daniel’s certiorari petition on two questions: (1) Whether humorous use of another’s trademark as one’s own on a commercial product is subject to the Lanham Act’s traditional likelihood-of-confusion analysis or instead receives heightened First Amendment protection from trademark-infringement claims; and (2) Whether humorous use of another’s mark as one’s own on a commercial product is “noncommercial” under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(3)(C) thus barring as a matter of law a claim of dilution by tarnishment under the Trademark Dilution Revision Act.

Surprising Denials

Although this year was filled with numerous requests for Supreme Court review of challenging issues facing intellectual property as usual the Court met those requests with denials of certiorari. Perhaps the biggest letdown of the year was the denial of review in American Axle & Manufacturing Inc. Petitioner v. Neapco Holdings LLC et al. on June 30 2022. This case was the latest in a long line of attempts to have the Court reframe patent eligibility under 35 U.S.C. § 101. Even the Solicitor General recommended granting the petition at least regarding the question of whether claiming a process for manufacturing an automobile driveshaft that simultaneously reduces two types of driveshaft vibration is patent-eligible under 35 U.S.C. § 101. Unfortunately for many holding out hope that the Court would provide clarity on subject matter eligibility the Court went against the Solicitor General’s recommendation and denied certiorari.

Another surprising denial was Juno Therapeutics Inc. et al. v. Kite Pharma Inc. on November 7 2022. The central issue in Juno was whether the written description requirement under 35 U.S.C. § 112(a) requires an inventor to demonstrate possession of the full scope of the claimed invention including all “known and unknown” variations of each component of the invention. The subject matter of the patent is single-chain antibody variable fragments which is a technology area jammed with issues of enablement and written description. Juno particularly highlights the issues with attempts to claim antibody binding elements based on their functional properties rather than by their structural features.

However Juno did not stop there. Juno filed a request for rehearing on November 23 2022 requesting that the Court grant rehearing of its order denying the petition for certiorari vacate that order and hold their case in abeyance pending the resolution of Amgen because the questions in both cases arise from the same statutory limitation in Section 112(a).

A challenge to Section 112(a) was also the main question in Biogen International GmbH et al. v. Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. in which certiorari was denied earlier this year. However in Biogen the main issue focused on written description and whether the requirement for written description is satisfied when “specification describes the invention or must the specification also disclose data that demonstrates the claimed invention is ‘effective’ and emphasize the claimed invention by singling it out and describing it more than once.” Thus Biogen was distinguished from Amgen and Juno in questioning different aspects of Section 112(a).

Although the denials of Juno and Biogen were certainly disappointing practitioners and patent holders may be glad to have the Court grant certiorari on at least one half of the disclosure requirements in Section 112(a) by way of Amgen.

Looking Forward to 2023

The Court has requested the comments of the Solicitor General in several pending petitions including Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. v. GlaxoSmithKline LLC et al.; Interactive Wearables LLC v. Polar Electro Oy et al.;and Tropp v. Travel Sentry Inc.

Notably the Solicitor General will be briefing the Court in Teva on the government’s stance on the use of section VIII statements accompanying an Abbreviated New Drug Application (known as a “skinny label”) as a way to avoid infringement of a method patent. The decision for GSK by the Federal Circuit has already had rippling effects. Prior to this decision drug product marketed under a skinny label would be found to not infringe a patented treatment method exempted from the label. In this case GSK which owns Coreg (carvedilol) sued Teva for their marketing of a generic version of carvedilol under a “skinny label” listing hypertension and left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction (post-MI LVD) as indications. The Orange Book listing for Coreg included “decreasing mortality caused by congestive heart failure”. GSK successfully argued that Teva’s inclusion of treating post-MI LVD on their “skinny label” would induce infringement their claims to “a method of decreasing mortality caused by congestive heart failure” based on expert testimony that congestive heart failure and post-MI LVD are “intertwined”. The purpose of the skinny label is to provide an avenue for more timely entrance of generic drugs to the market. The future of the skinny label hangs in the balance while the Court awaits the Solicitor General’s comments.

Lastly another interesting case that will likely seek review of the Court is Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation v. HEC Pharm Co. LTD. In this case the Federal Circuit reversed its previous ruling for Novartis now finding that Novartis’s Gilenya patents lacked written description support for a negative limitation in the claims. This was also a procedurally unique case because panel of the earlier January 2022 decision consisted of Judge O’Malley (writing for the majority) Judge Linn and Chief Judge Moore (dissenting). Upon Judge O’Malley’s subsequent retirement and replacement on the panel by Judge Hughes HEC requested a rehearing. Judge Hughes agreed with Chief Judge Moore to order a rehearing which resulted in a reversal with Chief Judge Moore now writing the majority opinion with Judge Linn as the dissent.

Novartis filed a request for a stay of the Federal Circuit decision while their certiorari petition was being prepared. The Court granted a temporary stay but ultimately the request for a stay was denied on October 13 2022. It is likely that Novartis will file a certiorari petition requesting review of the unusual Federal Circuit decision in early 2023.

Blackrock vs Blackstone

Copy link to section

Blackstone and Blackrock are some of the biggest finance companies in the world with over $961 billion and $9 trillion in assets under management (AUM) respectively. The two firms have a similar heritage since Blackrock’s Larry Fink left Blackstone to start his firm.

They nonetheless operate in different industries. Blackstone’s business is in real estate private equity hedge fund solutions and credit and insurance. On the other hand Blackrock’s business is in equity fixed income multi-asset alternatives cash management and advisory. Blackrock is one of the biggest investors in publicly-traded companies in the US.

The two companies faced important challenges in 2022. Blackrock came under fire from conservatives who criticized the company for ignoring companies in the oil and gas. Florida’s treasurer voted to withdraw $2 billion in funds from the company.

Blackstone on the other hand was affected by high-interest rates and a liquidity crunch in its BREIT business. Its BREIT returns rose by 5% while publicly-traded REITs shed over 30% of their value as we wrote here. As a result many investors moved to redeem some of their funds. With real estate being highly illiquid the company placed limits on the amount of withdrawals.

Which is a better investment?

In terms of size Blackrock has a market cap of over $105 billion compared to Blackstone’s $87 billion. The two have 19900 and 3795 employees respectively. Meanwhile Blackrock has a dividend yield of 2.77% while Blackstone yields 4.81%. Blackstone has also grown its dividend by 16% in the past 3 years compared to Blackrock’s 14%. Therefore Blackstone wins in terms of dividend payouts to shareholders.

Blackrock always trades at a premium valuation compared to Blackstone. It has a forward PE ratio of 20.59 compared to Blackrock’s 20.59.

I believe that both BLK and BX are outstanding companies in their industries. Also the ESG and BREIT challenges are only temporary in nature. For one Blackrock still manages trillions of dollars for conservative states.

While the two are quality companies I believe that Blackrock is a better investment than Blackstone. For one the company has a growing private equity business that has $41 billion in assets under management. Further Blackrock’s business is more liquid than Blackstone.

He isn’t a tall man but his affable demeanor and slightly rakish appearance—piratical goatee distinctive comma shaved into wax-flattened hair—exude charisma. His mellow voice glides and hums between phrases: at times picking a careful path through a thorny garden; at others enveloping the listener in warm complicity. Every so often his cautious playfulness yields to outbursts of mischief: deadpan impressions; abrupt talk-show belly laughs; and when it came to me and my questions the ironic metacommentary of someone keenly sensitive to portraiture’s artifice.

We ended the night at Chez Malou a Congolese eatery promisingly emblazoned with the face of a no-nonsense matron next to an enormous hot pepper. The entourage feasted on pork bits tilapia and viscous okra soup. At one point Wiley a devoted angler broke the head off a fish smothered in onion sauce. He identified it from the bones as a catfish.

Fourteen models turned up the next day at a nondescript studio. Wiley’s assistant unpacked costume jewelry; his photographer Brad Ogbonna installed lights; and his manager Georgia Harrell distributed cash and contracts. Wiley sipped coffee and perused a sourcebook of reference images compiled by his research interns applying Post-its to those he planned to use. A sepia photograph showed King Leopold II with a hand tucked in his jacket; in an oil painting a boy wearing lacy crimson trousers held hands with his mother a smug duchess. I asked Wiley whether it mattered if an art work he adapted was any good. “It can be total crap as long as it’s a great pose” he replied. “Nobody’s going to be looking at the source.”

Yesterday’s strangers filled out paperwork dressed to the nines the ones and everything in between. Patrick the sapeur still wearing sunglasses arrived in a black velvet jacket with gold embroidery bringing a friend whose logo-covered kit from Moschino made him look like a race-car driver. Emerance in a floral sheath dress and pink heels lamented the gentrification of Matongé which she ironically described as “the famous African street.” Wiley gave brief remarks omitting the project’s historical background to avoid poisoning the vibe.

Under Leopold II the so-called builder king Brussels battened on profits from the ivory and rubber trades brutally extracted from the Congo Free State—which covered much of present-day Democratic Republic of Congo—in a terror that killed millions. His equestrian likeness still overlooks Matongé testament to a bloody legacy that has made Brussels home to one of the largest Little Africas in Europe. Wiley’s show takes inspiration from Leopold’s obsession with Congolese flora. The monarch maintained a sprawling network of greenhouses at his palace in the city’s suburbs where he tried to cultivate rare plants from his African fiefdom.

Most of the transplants died—an allegory in Wiley’s view for the failure of the colonial project. One of the artist’s calling cards is what he terms botanical filigree a vegetal backdrop that surrounds or even entwines his sitters. For the Brussels exhibition he’s deploying the motif in bronze and marble enclosing human figures in glass “greenhouse pods” that evoke Leopold’s folly. “I wanted to re-create the horror of it but infuse it with vitality” he explained in one of our conversations envisioning contemporary Afro-Europeans as signs of “historical continuity and resistance.”

Now they took the stage in a whirl of tableaux vivants. The baguette boy became a clingy nymph in a gender-swapped rendition of Jacques-Louis David’s “The Farewell of Telemachus and Eucharis” pressing his cheek against a young woman’s shoulder as Wiley delicately adjusted the position of his foot. The artist modelled a regal stance for the race-car driver who grinned sheepishly and made a finger gun with his hand. Wiley laughed so hard that he actually slapped his knees.

“It’s more like this” Wiley said once he’d recovered his composure. “Très . . .”—he thrust his chest forward threw down his hands scowled disdainfully and sniffed. Later he practiced a balletic half-turn with Emerance cupping his joined hands in an expression of feminine poise.

The models posed for sculptures on an enormous lazy Susan. Ogbonna worked the camera as Wiley crouching turned the apparatus shouting “Take!” with clockwork regularity. (The artist’s studio uses software to combine the shots into three-dimensional renderings which are subsequently printed in polymer clay.) At certain moments he looked like a supplicant kneeling before his subjects; at others a potter throwing them on the wheel. Afrobeats played continuously. One model’s frozen figure revolved to the slick rhythms of “Monalisa” by Lojay and Sarz: “Baby follow my commanding like zombie Go down on me with your coca body . . . you can’t run away.”

Wiley raced back and forth between stage and camera as though running speed drills. First the quilted jacket came off; then the Lacoste sweatshirt. At one point sweat caused hair wax to run into his eyes and he briefly interrupted the shoot to call for a Kleenex.

“That’s fucking amazing” he told Ogbonna as they clicked through shots. “You can see them as sculptures already.”

The fifth of six children in a struggling single-parent household Kehinde Wiley was born in South Central Los Angeles in 1977. He and his fraternal twin Taiwo were the offspring of a fleeting campus romance between Freddie Mae Wiley an African American linguistics major and Isaiah Obot a Nigerian studying architecture both at U.C.L.A. Obot had returned to Nigeria when Freddie Mae gave birth and ignored her requests for a list of baby names in his native Ibibio. Determined to preserve a sense of their Nigerian heritage she gave the two boys traditional Yoruba names for twins.

Wiley made his first art works on the walls of the family’s home on Jefferson Avenue. The Wileys who sometimes relied on welfare didn’t have much money. But Freddie Mae supplemented their income by converting the house into what the artist fondly described as a “ ‘Sanford and Son’-style” antique store which she piously dubbed My Father’s Business. Wiley grew up immersed in his mother’s business: vintage clothes claw-foot furniture Afrocentric statues and antique tchotchkes all laid out for sale in an overgrown greenhouse.

Wiley learned Spanish from customers composition by sketching merchandise and cooking from Julia Child whose shows inspired him to take over in the family kitchen before he was ten. “Within a year he was a better cook than my mom” Taiwo told me. “I hate to see it published but it’s true.” Recognizing his precocity Freddie Mae enrolled Wiley in art classes and took him on excursions to museums like the Huntington Library in San Marino where he fell in love with eighteenth-century English portraiture even as he struggled with a feeling of exclusion from the rarefied white world it evoked. (The Huntington recently exhibited Wiley’s answer to Thomas Gainsborough directly opposite “The Blue Boy.”) A study-abroad program in the Soviet Union further broadened his horizons and when he returned Wiley matriculated at the L.A. County High School for the Arts.

“I understood very early about the social component to art” Wiley told me. He staged his first solo show at the house before he’d even graduated treating visitors from around the neighborhood to a sparkling-cider reception. Every painting sold; when a family friend offered to buy a work that Wiley had made especially for Freddie Mae—a portrait of a woman in a field of flowers—the teen-age artist encouraged his mother to take the deal. “I wouldn’t even say that art is the greatest thing that Kehinde will accomplish before the Lord promotes him” Freddie Mae told me. “I see him as a great entrepreneur.”

The sales helped pay for his room and board at the San Francisco Art Institute where he earned a bachelor’s degree in 1999. That year he entered the M.F.A. program at Yale; his friends there included other now prominent artists like Wangechi Mutu and Mickalene Thomas. “We all sought each other out as the few Black students in our departments” Mutu told me via e-mail. She and Wiley met on the dance floor at parties and visited each other’s studios where she recalls being impressed by the intricacy of his then small compositions. He remembers them less charitably. “I was making like really embarrassing allegorical paintings that involved onions and watermelons” Wiley told me. “Assuming that people understand the importance of a citrus fruit in a painting or an Italian cypress or something—it’s just not gonna fly.”

He experimented with painting people from Black neighborhoods in New Haven prompted by the constant racial profiling that he faced on campus. Nowadays portraiture is enjoying a renaissance but at the time Wiley’s decision to represent people—especially those who weren’t white—was a bold break with the era’s conceptualism. At first Wiley hedged the transition trying to “justify figuration” by suspending his models in crisp color fields. That changed after a studio visit from Kerry James Marshall whose critique profoundly altered Wiley’s approach to the relationship between figure and ground. “ ‘Enough with the sharp edges. They’re cold they’re clinical and they say a lot about you’ ” Wiley recalls the older artist saying. The comment helped inspire his work’s distinctive entanglement of decorative patterns with limbs and skin. Wiley realized that the interplay could stand in for other relationships: race and society man and marketplace model and artist.

He moved to New York in 2001 arriving with little money and a romantic vision of life in the big city. Brian Keith Jackson a novelist from Louisiana remembers meeting Wiley when he came to a party at the writer’s apartment with a plastic bottle of gin.

In addition to AOTY ROTY and SOTY nods Beyoncé has a commanding presence in the R&B song categories as three cuts from RENAISSANCE (Parkwood/Columbia) are up for R&B noms. Bey’s nomination haul which sets her up to potentially become the most-awarded artist in Grammy history doesn’t include a nod for R&B album—she submitted her culture-shifting LP in the Dance category instead.

The biggest question for Grammy prognosticators: If this is truly Bey’s year can anyone beat her? Or will the commercial and cultural force that is RENAISSANCE sweep the categories in which it’s nominated?

R&B legend Mary J. Blige whose return to the spotlight in 2022 included general field noms for Album and Record and a performance during Dr. Dre’s Super Bowl Halftime Show earned nods in all three R&B song categories as well as Best R&B Album. Could Mary earn some hardware as a make-good for past snubs?

Blige Morton Long

In Best R&B Performance Def Jam’s Muni Long—a favorite in a field of newcomers for Best New Artist—goes up against legends Bey and Blige with her breakthrough “Hrs & Hrs.” Although the songwriter-turned-artist is surrounded by Grammy favorites including RCA’s Lucky Daye and Jazmine Sullivan Long’s smash still stands out as the year’s most viral R&B cut. Can she prevail in a field that’s thick with both star power and powerful Grammy agendas?

Best R&B Song has Bey Blige Sullivan and Long competing once again though in this category Beyoncé’s “CUFF IT” a funky throwback that could fill a dancefloor in any decade seems primed to get its due (co-writers include Nile Rodgers Raphael Saadiq The-Dream Nova Wav and Morten Ristorp). EMPIRE’s PJ Morton who’s hauled in Grammy noms six years in a row is an x-factor as the sole credited writer and artist on “Please Don’t Walk Away.” Although this is a songwriter’s award expect the gravitational pull of the artists involved to be significant.

Best Traditional R&B Performance features Blige and Bey (“PLASTIC OFF THE SOFA”) again alongside another high-profile R&B artist Babyface for his collaboration with Ella Mai “Keeps on Fallin’” (Capitol). Rounding out the group is Artium/Roc Nation’s Snoh Aalegra with “DO 4 LOVE” and EMPIRE artist Adam Blackstone’s collab with Jazmine Sullivan “’Round Midnight.” Traditional or not Bey would seem to have the mojo here.

Best Progressive R&B Album is where you can find RCA phenom Steve Lacy who gets a nod for Gemini Rights. Though his smash from the set “Bad Habit” didn’t get a nod in the R&B field. It’s in Pop Solo Performance and biggies Record and Song of the Year. Lacy the youngest nominee in this group is up against previously nominated acts Terrace Martin and Cory Henry and Tank and The Bangas and Moonchild. It’s hard to imagine anything else being deemed more “progressive” than Lacy for whatever that’s worth.

Previous Best R&B Album nominees Robert Glasper Lucky Daye and PJ Morton get the nod again this year as they take on Blige’s Good Morning Gorgeous (Deluxe) and Chris Brown’s Breezy (Deluxe). Since 2018 Morton has received three nominations for this award without a victory. Could his association with 2022 AOTY winner Jon Batiste give him an edge this time?

“For each Boeing 777-300ER operated by SWISS this means annual savings of around 400 tons of kerosene and more than 1200 tons of carbon dioxide. The slightly shorter Boeing 777F saves around 370 tons of fuel and 1170 tons of CO2 each year.”

This will see it spread its wings beyond the automotive domain to new segments such as aviation energy medical applications and even toys.

At present Suba makes engineering plastic parts under sub-categories including wiper and starter motor gears power windows engine pulleys oil filters chain tensioners and machined stems.

The company is a Tier-1 supplier to TVS Motor Company and Tier-2 to BorgWarner Bosch Comstar Inteva Lucas-TVS Johnson Electric and others. It also exports to companies in the Americas Asia and Europe.

Geetha Baskaran Director told Mobility Outlook that Suba is now developing engineering plastic parts by moulding PEEK (polyether ether ketone) a tough and expensive material which retails at about INR 12000 per kg.

Left: Wiper gears. Right: Geetha Baskaran

New Materials New Opportunities

PEEK is used to make parts for demanding applications such as bearings pistons pumps compressor plate valves and cable insulations. Since it is compatible with ultrahigh vacuum applications Suba is exploring the idea of making parts used in medical applications.

In the long-term continued Baskaran the company will develop parts for the aviation sector which will need light materials with high-tensile properties. She said plans are also underway for foraying into electric mobility industrial pumps the energy sector and medical applications.

The company has been making sensor brackets for e2W makers but has gone one step further. It is now in the final stages of testing battery enclosers developed for a small electric commercial manufacturer. The toolroom set up in 1991 and the design centre established in 2005 come in handy for the project.

As these enclosers are large (close to a metre) Suba is expanding capacity with a 450-tonne moulding line. Currently it has moulding lines up to 350 tonne which can make parts weighing around a kilogram and about 0.7 metres long.

The company is sitting on an order book of nearly 30000 units for the battery enclosures. “The new machine is being commissioned specifically to support EV makers and those in the energy sector. If we are competitive we can get more business. Our focus is on reducing the cost further” said Baskaran.

Plastic parts manufactured by Suba Plastics

Import Substitute Solutions

As part of its effort to offer import substitute solutions Suba is working on door latches in engineering plastics. It is also planning to make gears for motors in sunroofs and power-adjustable seats for passenger vehicles. Substituting plastic gears for machined gears is also on the cards.

“In addition to PEEK we are conducting research on raw material that is abrasive-resistant lightweight free from UV-related issues and self-lubricating” said Baskaran. This according to her will open up huge opportunities especially in the automotive space.

The company she added was recently asked by a leading 2W maker to replace metal parts including those made of aluminium with plastics to enhance fuel efficiency. The OEM is looking at giving orders for about ten components in the short-term.

Suba is also looking at expanding its toolroom to support new businesses like toys where the potential is immense thanks to huge demand from local manufacturers to get import substitutes said Baskaran.

New Plant

The mother plant established in Jothipuram (20 km from Coimbatore on the road to Ooty) nearly four decades ago is gasping for space. Keeping in mind these new growth areas Suba is shifting production to a new facility adjacent to its second plant in Vellamadai about 25 km from the city. Consequently the Jothipuram facility will become an R&D hub.

The new plant will be almost equal to its second plant in size (30000 sq ft) and will soon go green with the proposed solar energy project. This is a temperature-controlled plant where more than half the workforce comprises women.",,,,,,,,,

From five “1-in-1000-year” floods to history-making hurricanes and blizzards 2022 was an unforgettable year. Here are the photos that define the year’s most momentous weather events.

Copied

As 2022 comes to a close AccuWeather looks back at unforgettable weather photos that captured the most memorable events of the past 12 months. Across the country weather events uprooted families and made towns come together in a way like no other.

From countless winter storms to severe weather outbreaks and one of the deadliest hurricanes since the 1930s there were no shortages of weather across the country.

Here are just a few of the most memorable photos from this past year.

Sea spray freezes on homes after Boston blizzard

A ferocious nor'easter which rapidly intensified into a bomb cyclone slammed areas from the mid-Atlantic to Maine during the final days of January. The heavy snow and hurricane-force winds resulted in a blizzard that generated whiteout conditions in many areas.

Boston was hammered by prolific snowfall with rates of 2-4 inches per hour. Roughly 20 miles southwest of the city in parts of Norfolk County the snowfall rate exceeded 4 inches per hour in the heaviest snow bands. The highest snowfall total was measured in Stoughton Massachusetts which is a town about 20 miles southwest of Boston in Norfolk County when 30.9 inches of snow was recorded.

Boston measured a total of 23.8 inches of snow from the storm which made this storm the seventh-largest snowfall event in Boston history.

Sea spray kicked up by the hurricane-force winds that gusted over 100 mph in some areas completely encased homes in Brant Rock Massachusetts which is a coastal town about 30 miles southeast of Boston.

The nor'easter also bombarded coastal areas south of New England dumping particularly heavy snowfall on Islip New York with a daily snowfall total of 22.9 inches. Islip which is east of New York City on Long Island and the location of New York City's National Weather Service (NWS) office racked up 24.7 inches throughout the entirety of the storm. According to NOAA 100% of New England was covered in snow in the wake of the storm.

Severe weather leaves survivors' thankful

Nearly 1330 tornadoes were recorded as relentless rounds of severe weather barreled across the country this year according to preliminary storm data from the Storm Prediction Center (SPC). As the copious amounts of severe weather devastated towns uprooted entire families and occurred at seemingly the worst time possible survivors came out ""thankful"" for their lives.

By March severe weather season was in full swing. A severe thunderstorm outbreak on March 21 fueled a powerful EF3 tornado that tore through Jacksonboro Texas. The twister damaged at least 80 homes and injured nine people as it ripped through the town located just northwest of Fort Worth.

At least two of the three schools located in Jacksonboro were significantly damaged by the twister. No injuries or fatalities were reported from the schools which were both in session at the time of the tornado. Teachers were credited for ushering the students to a safe place to wait out the storm.

The severe weather continued moving east and created widespread destruction in Louisiana. In New Orleans' Lower 9th Ward a ferocious and deadly EF3 twister rampaged through an area that Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Ida heavily impacted.

""Unfortunately our people have become all too familiar with rebuilding after tragedy and loss but it is never easy"" the governor said following the severe weather outbreak.

At least one death was attributed to the storms in Louisiana. Connor Lambert a 25-year-old resident of Arabi was on his way home from his parents when the storm struck. The St. Bernard Parish coroner's office said he died of multiple blunt-force injuries according to The Associated Press.

According to the SPC 14 fatalities were reported from severe weather across the U.S. in March alone.

In April May and June more than 500 twisters were reported across the U.S. The severe weather season seemed to quiet as the summer months got underway. But it didn't stay quiet for too long. By November more rounds of severe weather spun up across the country.

At least two people were killed and others were injured after an outbreak spawned across the southern Plains during the first week of November. As residents cleaned up the debris after the storms they were thankful to be alive.

During a severe weather outbreak in mid-December an EF2 tornado ripped through Killona Louisiana which is located roughly 25 miles west of storm-weary New Orleans. At least one person died and several were injured following the twister that knocked down powerlines and blocked roads.

From drought to deluge historic flooding regularly makes headlines

From the Desert Southwest to the southern Plains and Midwest epic deluges were common during the summer. Over a five-week period in the middle of the summer five areas across the U.S. all experienced 1-in-a-1000-year flooding events.

Yellowstone National Park closed in mid-June due to unprecedented rainfall which created extremely hazardous conditions such as heavy flooding and rockslides. More than 10000 visitors were evacuated as the park closed for the first time in history due to the flooding. Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte declared a statewide disaster due to the crisis stating that rapid snowmelt and heavy rains led to the flooding which left many in the state without power or water services.

After a 67-day dry streak in Dallas 8 to 16 inches of rain fell over a 24-hour stretch in the city. The heavy rain flooded buildings submerged cars on interstates and caused the Trinity River to swell well beyond its normal water line.

Historic and deadly flooding was also reported in St Louis eastern Kentucky southeastern Illinois and Death Valley which all resulted in billions of dollars worth of damage according to an AccuWeather estimate.

AccuWeather Founder and CEO Dr. Joel N. Myers who has for decades closely studied the economic impacts of extreme weather estimated that the total damage and financial loss resulting from the catastrophic flash flooding would range between $4.5 billion and $6 billion.

Hurricane Ian

Although there were a total of 14 named tropical systems in the Atlantic Ocean basin during the 2022 Atlantic hurricane season one storm will stand out in years to come. Hurricane Ian wrote a new chapter in weather history books as it brought destructive winds disastrous storm surge and impressive rainfall totals to Florida in late September.

On Sept. 23 Ian formed in the central Caribbean Sea southwest of Jamaica. The storm steered across Cuba surviving the island's mountainous terrain before it underwent rapid intensification in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The storm packed dangerous winds as it slammed into the southwest Florida coastline as a high-end Category 4 hurricane.

Ian made landfall as the fourth-strongest hurricane in Florida's history when it roared ashore in Punta Gorda on Sept. 28 with wind speeds of 150 mph.

The storm brought a catastrophic storm surge of 18 feet to the barrier island in southwest Florida and major flooding to the rest of the state. Heavy rainfall led to more than a dozen USGS river gauges across Florida exceeding major flood stages and rainfall totals surpassing two feet in many towns.

The death toll climbed for weeks following Ian. The storm killed at least 139 people in Florida alone making it the deadliest hurricane in the state since the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane which killed over 400 people.

In Fort Myers one of the harder-hit areas photos of the town showed beachfront properties scattered like matchsticks across the sand. Communities were obliterated and entire islands were cut off from the mainland. Boats the once were neatly organized in marinas littered roadways.

Historic lake-effect snow in New York

A lake-effect snowstorm of epic proportions dumped nearly 7 feet of snow across parts of New York during a five-day period in the middle of November. Dump trucks were brought in to remove snow and plow drivers worked around the clock to clear the roadways.

Hamburg New York located 14 miles south of downtown Buffalo measured a colossal 81.2 inches of accumulation as of Monday afternoon. Orchard Park located 11 miles southeast of downtown Buffalo and home to the NFL's Buffalo Bills measured 80 inches of snow.

Orchard Park unofficially received 66 inches of accumulation over a 24-hour timespan. If confirmed by the New York state climatology office this would set a new state record for the most snowfall in a 24-hour period. The current record stands at 50 inches measured in Camden New York in 1966.

The daily snowfall record was broken not once but twice at the Buffalo-Nagara International Airport. On Friday Nov. 18 16.1 inches of accumulation was measured at the weather station at the airport which broke the record of 7.6 inches set in 2014. On Saturday the record was broken again when an impressive 21.5 inches accumulated at the weather station.

One official in western New York even noted that this most recent storm surpassed the 2014 long-duration snowfall event commonly known as ""Snowvember"" in some ways.

""This was a record-breaking storm that in some ways it was more intense than the storm that we had Snowvember back in 2014"" Karen Hoak deputy commissioner of public works for the county highway division told the Buffalo News. ""We saw at some times that there were six inches per hour of accumulation so the recovery is still continuing.""

Grab a pencil and a piece of scratch paper and prepare to rip your hair out (in the best way). No cheating!



➡ The Problem

Plenty of scientific experiments are plagued with questions of causation and correlation. When lots of events occur at the same time our minds attempt to put the jumble in an order based on reason rather than randomness. Especially when numbers are concerned we can’t help but search for patterns! Take this mathematics problem posed in 1841 by French novelist Gustave Flaubert in a letter to his sister Caroline.

“A ship sails the ocean. It left Boston with a cargo of wool. It grosses two hundred tons. It is bound for Le Havre. The mainmast is broken the cabin boy is on deck there are twelve passengers aboard the wind is blowing Northeast the clock points to a quarter past three in the afternoon. It is the month of May. How old is the captain?”

While this feels like a series of unrelated facts I submit to you that there must be a solution! For a novelist famed for an endless search for le mot juste in his works it’s clear that every single word of this problem must be important. Can you find the solution?

The global Phase III program aims to assess the safety and efficacy of two dosages of obefazimod 25 mg and 50 mg in both patients who have either failed advanced therapies (AT) or are AT-naïve. The program consists of two induction studies—ABTECT-1 (ABX464-105; NCT05507203) and ABTECT-2 (ABX464-106; NCT05507216) as well as a subsequent ABTECT maintenance trial (ABX464-107; NCT05535946). All three studies are randomized double-blind and placebo controlled using independent blinded review of videotaped endoscopies.

The program is expected to evaluate 1200 UC patients ages 16 and over at 600 study sites in 36 countries 600 patients per induction study. In both induction studies patients will be treated for eight weeks in this program. The first patient in the United States was dosed with obefazimod in October.

“We are expecting to recruit roughly 25% of the overall study population of the overall number of patients in the United States” Hartmut J. Ehrlich MD Abivax’s CEO told GEN Edge.

Patients from both induction studies who demonstrate a clinical response of at least a 30% improvement in symptoms will be enrolled in a single maintenance study. The program’s primary efficacy endpoint will be clinical remission according to the modified Mayo Score as required by the FDA and as assessed at week 8 in the induction and at week 44 in the maintenance study.

Topline results are expected by the end of 2024 for the induction studies and by the end of 2025 for the maintenance study. Should the studies yield positive results Abivax plans to file for regulatory approvals early in 2026.

Also during 2023 Abivax is expected to begin developing obefazimod for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) starting with UC in children ages 2–17 following FDA approval of a Pediatric Study Plan (iPSP) that the company announced on Tuesday.

Obefazimod is designed to upregulate miR-124 an anti-inflammatory microRNA. Obefazimod enhances the selective splicing of a single long noncoding RNA to generate miR-124 which downregulates cytokines and chemokines shown to promote inflammation including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha IL-6 monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and IL-17 as well as Th17+ cells. Under its former name ABX464 obefazimod was initially developed against HIV but was repurposed to fight inflammatory conditions based on its anti-inflammatory effect.

Obefazimod’s anti-inflammatory effect is believed to be triggered when the molecule binds to its target the cap binding complex located on the 5′ end of every cellular noncoding RNA molecule. The binding results in the splicing of a long noncoding RNA that induces the overexpression of miR-124 which launches a cascade that is believed to propagate the drug’s anti-inflammatory effect.

“If they’re binding to their target genes they actually block the translation of target genes. Some of these target genes that we are talking about here are IL-17 interleukin-17 and interleukin-23 also TNF alpha and IL-6” Ehrlich said. “By binding the expression of these cytokines is essentially reduced.

“It’s typically in contrast to the way monoclonal antibodies work. They can block 100% of the activity of a certain cytokine. Here we are having a broader approach” Ehrlich added.

Sweet spot

Abivax envisions obefazimod as a first-line treatment for UC and Crohn’s after failure of conventional treatments—a sweet spot now occupied by several tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors of which the best-selling drug is AbbVie’s multi-indication blockbuster Humira® (adalimumab) which generated $15.658 billion in Q1–Q3 2022 up nearly 2% from $15.36 billion a year ago. Being a biologic Humira will start to see competition from lower cost biosimilars starting in 2023 though its patent protection doesn’t end until 2034.

Additional biologics with UC indications include another TNF inhibitor Remicade® (infliximab) marketed by Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Biotech; another J&J (Janssen Immunology) drug the human interleukin-12 and -23 antagonist Stelara® (ustekinumab); and Entyvio® (vedolizumab) an integrin receptor antagonist marketed by Millennium: The Takeda Oncology Company.

Stelara racked up $7.336 billion in Q1–Q3 2022 up 7.9% from $6.8 billion a year ago; and Remicade $1.868 billion down 23% from $2.426 billion. Entyvio—Takeda’s biggest-selling product—generated ¥521.8 billion ($3.848 billion) in sales in Takeda’s last full fiscal year which ended March 31 2022 up 21.5% from ¥429.3 billion ($3.166 billion) a year earlier. Since then Entyvio has racked up ¥646.6 billion ($4.768 billion) in the first half of the company’s current fiscal year up 35% from ¥255.9 billion ($1.887 million) in April–September 2021.

Obefazimod would also compete with other oral small molecule drugs including Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS)’s sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator Zeposia® (ozanimod) AbbVie’s Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor Rinvoq® (upadacitinib) and another JAK inhibtor Pfizer’s Xeljanz® and extended-release version Xeljanz® XR (tofacitinib).

During the first three quarters of 2022 Rinvoq generates $1.752 billion up 38% from $1.134 billion in Q1-Q3 2021; Xenjanz $1.304 billion down 25% from $1.734 billion; and Zeposia $171 million nearly double from $99 million. Pfizer blamed the drop on lower prescription volumes since last year when the FDA began requiring the company to add a warning to its label about increased risk of serious heart-related events such as heart attack or stroke cancer blood clots and death.

Other drugs indicated for UC or IBD include anti-inflammatory treatments such as 5-aminosalicylates and corticosteroids; immune system suppressants such as Azathioprine (Azasan Imuran) and mercaptopurine (Purinethol Purixan); and Cyclosporine (Gengraf Neoral Sandimmune).

Abivax discovered obefazimod after screening compounds from its library for the potential to modulate RNA biogenesis.

“For us the Phase III is really important from the point of view of either confirming that the best induction results are being achieved with 50 mg or that the 25 mg dose is as potent. We know [25 mg] was for the induction study but we don’t know for the maintenance study so that study will tell us at what dose we are intending to use the molecule for maintenance after licensure” Ehrlich said. “This will either be 50 mg—provided that the dose as it did in the past is safe upon long-term treatment—or if the 25 is as good as the 50 especially for maintenance then of course we would prefer moving forward with the 25 mg.”

Bruce Sands MD the Dr. Burrill B. Crohn professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and chief of the Henry D. Janowitz Division of Gastroenterology at Mount Sinai serves as principal investigator of the studies in the United States.

Positive Phase IIb data

In September Sands Ehrlich and 13 other researchers from Abivax and clinical partners published a study in the Lancet Gastroenteroology & Hepatology reporting positive data from a 254-patient Phase IIb induction and 48-week maintenance study (NCT04023396). The data showed all three doses of obefazimod (25 mg 50 mg and 100 mg) to have significantly improved moderate-to-severe active UC from baseline to week 8 compared with placebo as measured by changes in modified Mayo Score (MMS).

At week 8 the least squares mean (LSM) change from baseline in MMS was –2·9 for patients dosed with 100 mg of obefazimod –3·2 for the 50 mg group –3·1 for the 25 mg group and –1·9 for patients randomized to placebo. “This validates the safety and efficacy data generated with obefazimod in the initial phase IIa study in patients suffering from ulcerative colitis including in a patient population refractory to biologics and/or JAK inhibitor treatments” stated Séverine Vermeire MD PhD head of the IBD Center at the University Hospitals Leuven Belgium and principal investigator of the Phase IIb study.

In April Abivax reported positive data from the first 78 patients evaluated from its Phase IIb open-label maintenance study showing clinical remission in 55.3% of 217 UC patients after 48 weeks of once-daily oral 50mg obefazimod. In the subgroup of 121 patients who had at least a clinical response after the 8-week Phase IIb induction study 65.3% achieved clinical remission during the first year of maintenance treatment—compared with 66.7% in the company’s earlier Phase IIa study.

After UC Abivax aims to develop obefazimod to treat Crohn’s disease and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). While the company has yet to conduct any clinical studies in Crohn’s it is the first indication that Abivax is in process of financing since most UC treatments are also indicated for Crohn’s and because its mechanisms of disease propagation are similar to those of UC which like Crohn’s is a type of IBD.

Once that financing is available Ehrlich said Abivax will proceed with a Phase IIb study rather than spend time on a two-way proof of concept study abiding by a recommendation of the company’s clinical trial steering committee consisting of Sands Vermeire and William J. Sandborn MD of University of California San Diego.

In RA Abivax has completed a Phase IIa induction study (NCT03813199) in 60 patients with moderate to severe RA for which it reported encouraging data in June 2021: The combination of once-daily 50 mg obefazimod and methotrexate met the study’s primary endpoint of safety and tolerability during the 12-week induction phase.

Abivax acknowledged that the sample size was not powered to show efficacy—but added that patients dosed with 50 mg obefazimod showed statistically significant differences in the key secondary endpoint of 20% or greater improvement in disease activity as measured by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria (ACR20) compared to placebo at week 12.

However given limited cash “clearly our focus at this point in time is to get the UC going to work on funding and then get Crohn’s going and hopefully after Crohn’s rheumatoid arthritis.”

Raising Phase III capital

Abivax has estimated the cost of the Phase III obefazimod program in UC at €250 million ($265 million) consisting of €200 million through the release of maintenance study data plus another €50 million to finish the program.

The company began raising that capital in September by completing an oversubscribed €49.2 million ($52.2 million) financing with a group of investors from the United States and Europe. TCGX led the financing which included participation from Venrock Healthcare Capital Partners Deep Track Capital Sofinnova Partners Invus and Truffle Capital.

Abivax carried out the financing by raising approximately €46.2 million (about $49 million) through issuing 5.53 million new shares representing 33% of its current share capital at a subscription price of €8.36 ($8.87) per share—as well as by issuing €2.9 million (about $3.1 million) in royalty certificates.

The financing lengthened Abivax’s funding runway to the end of Q1 2023 based on the company prioritizing clinical development for obefazimod—with UC the top priority—and taking into account existing cash resources. The company finished the first half of 2022 with €26.57 million ($28.2 million) in cash and cash equivalents down 56% from €60.701 million ($64.4 million) in H1 2021.

During January–June 2022 Abivax’s net loss more than doubled from a year earlier to €29.553 million ($31.4 million) from €16.531 million (about $17.6 million). Revenue shriveled to €56000 (about $59500) from €9.64 million ($10.2 million) nearly all of that consisting of a one-off grant from France’s public investment bank Bpifrance toward a COVID-19 program for ABX464 that failed in 2021.

For the next 12 months following the September financing Abivax has said it will need approximately €100 million ($106 million)—the €46 million already raised plus an additional €54 million ($57 million).

“What we are currently looking to fund in the short term is the money to get us to the induction readout and here we are in the process of considering dilutive as well as nondilutive options” Ehrlich said. “We will report on them of course as quickly as these options turn into reality.”

In its Half-Year Financial Report 2022 released in September Abivax stated that pursuing additional dilutive and non-dilutive financing “will enable it to meet its debt maturities until the third quarter of 2023.”

Avoiding cost-cutting

In announcing the September financing Abivax warned that if it couldn’t raise the capital it needed for the Phase III program it would “review cost-cutting measures which could entail postponing or suspending” some programs.

“The lion’s share of the expenses resting with our [clinical trial] partner IQVIA. So this is not where we can and where we want to start cutting costs” Ehrlich said. “We are looking into all options but we are clearly confident that we will be able to raise the funding. And we don’t have to engage in major cost-cutting because the crew at Abivax from the very beginning has been very small.”

Abivax employs about 70 people. Given the Phase III trial for obefazimod Abivax expects to grow that workforce Ehrlich said though it has not specified how many positions it plans to add.

Obefazimod anchors a pipeline that includes a second clinical-phase candidate—ABX196 a synthetic synthetic glycolipid agonist of invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT) in a liposomal formulation administered intramuscularly. ABX196 is based on a proprietary platform technology designed to identify cells with immune enhancing potential in cancer models.

Ehrlich said Abivax is seeking a biopharma partner to advance ABX196 into Phase II and beyond nearly a year after the company presented encouraging results in the dose escalation phase of a Phase I/II trial that it said supporting further development of the drug to treat hepatocellular cancer (HCC).

At the ASCO GI Cancers Symposium 2022 Abivax presented data from an open-label Phase I/II trial (NCT03897543) showing a clinical benefit in five of 10 patients treated with the combination of ABX196 and BMS’ cancer immunotherapy blockbuster Opvido® (nivolumab). One patient showed a partial response and the other four stable disease. Median progression-free survival was 113.5 days (49-450 days) for all patients and 276 days (172–450 days) among those showing a clinical benefit.

“Abivax is not an oncology company and we really feel that in cancer indications when you are developing state-of-the-art therapies you need to have the experts with you” Ehrlich said. “We really are looking into finding a partnership moving forward for this particular molecule because our expertise is in inflammation but not in oncology.”",,,,,,,,,

US-China chip war and the end of globalization

Geopolitical tensions between the US and China spilled into the semiconductor sector in 2022 as the administration of US President Biden in December issued new export controls that block US companies from selling advanced semiconductors—as well as equipment used to make them—to certain Chinese manufacturers and then in December expanded those restrictions. Industry insiders said that the restrictions were a signal that the era of ever-increasing globalization is over and lamented that the restrictions would wreak havoc on the supply chain for all sorts of products—from computers to electronic vehicles— built on chip technology catching enterprises of all sorts in the cross-fire between the two global superpowers.

Broadcom to buy VMware for $61 billion

While the technology M&A market slackened overall during 2022 big-money deals were still plentiful and included Microsoft’s proposed acquisition of Activation Blizzard for $68.7 billion (still under regulatory review). The highlight for the enterprise computing sector though was undoubtedly silicon giant Broadcom’s deal to purchase virtualization powerhouse VMware for $61 billion which was announced in late May. The idea is to improve Broadcom’s bottom line offer synergies among software and hardware products and bolster offerings for multicloud computing environments.

Instead of salting my steak to create a brown crust by searing I created a brown crust with notes of caramel.

Ethan Frisch co-founder of Burlap & Barrel an artisanal spice company that works with small producers worldwide laughed wryly when he heard this story over Zoom. “This is the first time in history anyone could make that mistake. Refined white-bleached sugar is a very modern development in the centuries-old sugar industry. Sugar is brown! It’s only white when you do a lot of work to remove the brownness.”

His co-founder Ori Zohar elaborated: “The whole sugar industry is focused on this pure white chemical that is so far away from being a plant: a shelf-stable consistent interchangeable ingredient. None of those qualities make for good food” though it makes an item that can be traded around the world for similar base prices.

Many of us only know white granulated sugar that comes packaged with no information about its sugarcane or beet origins – much less its geographical origins – on its package. But sugar is diverse. White processed sugar makes up the largest segment of the global market but sugar also comes in liquid and brown forms. About 80% of the world’s production comes from sugarcane but some comes from beets. Even sugarcane itself is not a monolith; though most sugar is derived from the Saccharum officinarum species and its hybrids there are hundreds of varieties which have adapted (or been adapted through human intervention) to their specific ecosystems.

Zohar and Frisch are on a mission to “do to sugar what has been done to salt” in the last few years. You can now buy specialty salts from specific places and have specific characteristics: a black Himalayan salt that has a sulphurous funk or Burlap and Barrel’s Pearl salt from Tanzania’s Swahili coast with its surprisingly spherical crystals.

Saltverk which sells hand-harvested salt from Iceland has been riding this wave. Founder Björn Steinar Jónsson said “People want to know where the products they’re buying are from. We’ve seen this as a gradual growth in the salt industry and really we’re only at the beginning stages of where people understand what’s going into their salts. As a staple ingredient used by most of the world sugar could follow a similar path.”

This is not just marketing. A sugar’s texture and taste can be as individual as coffee beans from a corner of Ethiopia or wine grapes grown on a chilly slope in the Pacific north-west.

Brown sugar from Okinawa in Japan is a favorite of pastry chef Salvatore Martone of Le Jardinier in New York. He said: “Okinawa brown sugar (kokuto) is produced on eight remote Japanese islands. Each island produces sugar that has a slightly different taste. The sugar is sold in small irregular lumps and the flavor is rich minerally smokiness with an earthy undertone and a hint of bitterness.” He uses it for ice-cream.

Burlap & Barrel’s founders want to introduce consumers to sugars connected to a specific place and that have a distinctive flavor born of the environment that produced them. The company’s work expands the market for traceable sugar focusing on sourcing from communities using traditional processing methods.

It’s introduced panela a traditionally unrefined cane sugar from Boyacá Colombia. In June the company is launching two other single-origin sugars jaggery from Satara district India and a granulated sugar from Portvale Barbados. When the company uses the term “single-origin” it doesn’t merely refer to a country of origin but a single farm or producer.

Had I reached for their sand-textured panela in making my steak I could not have mistaken it for salt. Its soft irregular granules are the color of milk caramel with which it shares similar aromas. A spoonful is like sucking on sweet cinnamon toffee. It melts on the tongue leaving a trace of floral spice as if I took a shot of ginger juice.

The jaggery has the varied irregular texture and look of crushed peanuts and opening it fills my apartment with the scent of fresh squeezed sugarcane. It comes from Dr Shashikant Salunkhe who has grown turmeric for Burlap & Barrel as part of a regenerative agricultural system. A local refiner filters the raw sugarcane juice with wild okra whose gel collects any floating impurities. The jaggery is granulated and then stone ground ancient methods that are worlds away from industrial filtration and mechanized refinement.

The Barbadian sugar’s crystals are startlingly angular and crunch loudly between one’s teeth.

“Barbadian sugar has to de-commoditize if they’re going to compete globally” said Frisch. This means that the country’s producers need to embrace their sugar as a specialty product and divert it from being blended with other sugars before it reaches supermarket shelves where it will be simply labeled “cane sugar”. Frisch wants people to understand what makes Barbadian sugar so good – the terroir of its coral island flavors enhanced by molasses cane fed by rainwater and not irrigation like in most industrial practices and its history.

View image in fullscreen Sugar production has an ugly past with roots in slavery and abhorrent working conditions into the present. Photograph: Ethan Frisch

Sugar production has an ugly past. About 5 million slaves were brought to the Caribbean most to toil on sugar plantations starting in the mid-1500s. The slave trade reached its height in the 1700s and Barbados known as Sugar Island was its crown jewel. Abolitionists in Europe and the US waged boycotts of sugar a slave-derived good that represented abhorrent working conditions.

Centuries later Frisch and Zohar want consumers to demand sugars that retain their individual nuanced flavors. “Home cooks and chefs have huge buying power” said Zohar which could advance more sustainable and equitable production. Sugarcane farms are responsible for massive deforestation. Added to innumerable food products sugar drives the global obesity epidemic. Sugar from the Dominican Republic’s Central Romana corporation which is often supplied to and sold as Domino brand has been banned from the US since November 2023 due to allegations about exploitative work conditions and forced labor among its largely Haitian migrant workforce.

But as of the moment it’s difficult to know exactly where your sugar comes from. Non-alcoholic beverage company Everleaf goes to extraordinary lengths to source botanicals. Founder Paul Mathew is a conservation biologist and his company has tracked down “cherry blossoms hand-picked in the Shizuoka region of Japan between May and August” and gum acacia used for mouthfeel from the Sahel region of Africa.

That wasn’t possible with sugar which Mathew said is all being “hoovered up into a commodity-based industrial system”. The UK-based company is currently switching from fair-trade sugar derived from sugarcane to beet sugar from the UK prioritizing a lesser carbon footprint.

One way for a company to know where its sugar comes from is for that business to grow it themself. This is what Copalli Rum in Belize chooses to do. The majority of rum is made from molasses produced when sugarcane juice is boiled multiple times in sugar’s refining process and sucrose is removed. But new agricole-style rums which are made from fermenting fresh sugarcane juice like Copalli are emerging from former commodity sugar plantation fields from Hawaii to Belize. Copalli uses red and black cane instead of yellow cane engineered over many years to produce commercial sugar in Belize.

Wil Maheia the philanthropy services advisor for Copalli has tended to this area his entire life. His great-grandparents worked the land when it was a sugarcane plantation and he helped organize Belize’s first debt-for-nature swap (a transaction where a country’s debt is exchanged for environmental conservation commitments).

He’s proud to say: “We have never cut any rainforest to plant cane.” To the contrary – Copalli is cultivating 220 acres of sugarcane on old citrus orchards rather than reaching into 12000 acres of rainforest. As the largest employer in southern Belize it’s creating jobs that do not rely on the logging industry and deforestation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9iZXJrc2hpcmUvbmFtZS9mcmFua2xpbi1icm93bi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD01NTA4MzU4MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Franklin Brown Obituary (1946 - 2024) - Hinsdale MA - The Berkshire Eagle,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/berkshire/name/franklin-brown-obituary?id=55083582 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9iZXJrc2hpcmUvbmFtZS9mcmFua2xpbi1icm93bi1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD01NTA4MzU4MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The woman described by Harrah's as a ""longtime customer"" of Caesars Entertainment casinos claimed the largest table game jackpot ever at one of the company's Atlantic City casinos. She was playing Ultimate Texas Holdem.

In table games which are played against the house a progressive jackpot increases each time the game is played but the jackpot is not won. It resets only after a winner claims the progressive prize



The woman's win came Dec. 17 ahead of the Christmas holiday and she generously tipped her dealers $77000 NJ.com reported. That's about 4.6% of her total prize.

""Most people give tips but this was jaw-dropping"" Harrah's Atlantic City Director of Table Games Michael Zippel said in a statement given to Fox Business. ""Our dealers work hard all year long and truly deserve it.""

At Tropicana Atlantic City another Caesars Entertainment casino a New Jersey man won a $1.1 million jackpot last February on a progressive poker game and left a $50000 tip for the dealers. That was the previous record for the company's Atlantic City properties.

Caesars Entertainment is in the midst of a $400 million investment plan to renovate its resort facilities at its three Atlantic City casinos. Its flagship casino is Caesars Atlantic City on the Boardwalk.

New Jersey is considered one of the best states in the U.S. to make a living playing poker whether at a casino or online. On Monday head-to-head poker players got some exciting news as PokerStars announced it will combine its online player pools in New Jersey and Michigan beginning in January. The expansion of interstate play aims to grow the industry and generate to bigger prizes. A similar arrangement was reached in 2015 by gambling regulators in Nevada and Delaware.

""Michigan and New Jersey joining forces is great news for our players in these two states and poker more generally as it promises a better experience and even more value all with the confidence provided by a trusted licensed operator"" Severin Rasset PokerStars U.S. managing director told the Associated Press.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBsYW5ldGYxLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xhcy12ZWdhcy1ncmFuZC1wcml4LWVtcGVyb3ItcGFja2FnZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What does the $5million 'Emperor Package' for the Las Vegas Grand Prix get you?,"If you have got a spare $5million under your bed or down the back of the sofa then why not treat yourself to the ‘Emperor Package’ for the inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix?

Ever since we learned of plans to bring Formula 1 back to Las Vegas we always knew it was going to predominantly target the rich and famous folk of this world. We didn’t quite realise we would be reaching these astronomical prices…

Hot on the heels of Wynn Las Vegas’ $1million package which now looks like an absolute bargain is a $5million ‘Emperor Package’ unveiled by Caesars Entertainment.

You will start off by spending five nights in a luxury suite at the Premier Inn no sorry the 10300-square-foot three-bedroomed Nobu Sky Villa which offers panoramic views of the track and enough space to fit 75 people to watch all the action alongside you.

Michelin-starred chef Nobu Matsuhisa will be on hand to specially curate a menu for you (we’re presuming you will have to specifically request chicken nuggets and chips) and you will also have access to a 24-hour butler and a driver who will cruise you around in a Rolls Royce.

You also get 12 tickets to the F1 Paddock Club and Pit Lane Walk whilst six of you can go to the Nobu Sky Villa’s Qua Baths & Spa for any treatment you fancy.

A personal VIP host will organise experiences for you at all Caesars Entertainment’s Las Vegas resorts including food and beverage offerings across the city and OMNIA Nightclub at Caesars Palace and you will also be granted seven-star tier status on Caesars Rewards list.

And if that isn’t enough for you you will also get two tickets to watch Adele at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace. Talk about taking rolling in the deep to a whole new level.

You can head here for more information on this eye-watering Las Vegas Grand Prix package. We were also expecting you to become the 21st driver on the grid for the weekend but they must be reserving that for the $10million ‘Super Emperor’ package.

In a completely unrelated matter we would just like to say we are big fans of Caesars Palace and although we know it would be tough we would be willing to write up a review of the ‘Emperor Package’ in order to fully inform Formula 1 fans before they click add to basket.

It’s hard work but somebody has to do it.

Casino giant Caesars Entertainment is offering what may be the most extravagant guest package for next year's highly anticipated Formula One Las Vegas Grand Prix at a whopping US$5 million.

The luxury ""Emperor Package"" includes a five-night stay at the Nobu Sky Villa at Caesars Palace during race week with numerous amenities access to a personal driver and Rolls-Royce and two tickets to an Adele concert.

The multimillion dollar experience also grants VIP access to a 4700-square-foot terrace overlooking the Strip which will be decked out like a F1 race track.

The race in Vegas is expected to be the most expensive sporting event on Formula One's agenda next year. The price starts at $500 for a three-day general admission pass. Those seats were only added after fans complained that hotels planned to purchase massive ticket blocks and repackage them into entertainment experiences ranging from $100000 to $1 million.

Ahead of tickets first going on sale in November seats in the grandstands started at $2500.

F1 owned by U.S.-based Liberty Media will be a first-time promoter for the Nov. 18 night race that will use famous Vegas landmarks and rush down the Strip.

F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali told The Associated Press then that ""in terms of price positioning we are going to be on the top side because this is Las Vegas and that is the nature of the customer coming to Las Vegas.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vZ290aGFtbWFnLmNvbS9nb3Jkb24tcmFtc2F5LWZpc2gtYW5kLWNoaXBzLW55Y9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gordon Ramsay Opens New Restaurant in NYC,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://modernluxurymedia.com/international on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vZ290aGFtbWFnLmNvbS9nb3Jkb24tcmFtc2F5LWZpc2gtYW5kLWNoaXBzLW55Y9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Emirates gave travelers hoping to fly first class with a shower or Emirates business class a serious lump of coal for Christmas this year.

With absolutely no warning Emirates has been raising award rates to book first and business class by 20% or more forcing travelers to fork over tens of thousands in additional miles (or transferrable credit card points) to book many flights than they would have just a few days ago. These increases began rolling out late last week heading into the holiday and were first spotted by Monkey Miles and One Mile at a Time.

How bad is it? Take a look:

A one-way business class ticket from the east coast to Dubai (DXB) has increased from 115000 miles to 138000 miles each way

You get a hefty discount when booking roundtrip business class but those rates have shot up too: It'll now cost you 174000 Skywards miles roundtrip  up from 145000 miles

 up from 145000 miles Flying Emirates First Class from New York City (JFK) or Washington D.C.-Dulles (IAD) has gone from 136250 miles each way to 163500 miles – another 20% increase.

Starting from further away? A flight from Los Angeles (LAX) to Dubai will now run you 186000 Skywards miles each way – up from 155000

– up from 155000 Flights all across Emirates' networks have been affected like a first class award from Dubai (DXB) to Frankfurt which was 85000 miles each way but now costs 102000 miles

Only booking Emirates economy has been spared from these increases. But combined with the nasty surcharges of $800-plus that Emirates levies when redeeming miles on many routes it takes Emirates Skywards program from bad to worse. And more bad news may be in store.

So far Emirates' funky fifth-freedom routes to Europe – from Newark (EWR) to Athens (ATH) and another from New York City (JFK) to Milan (MXP) – have escaped unscathed … but it's only a matter of time before other shoe drops. While you won't see award rates have changed when searching and booking at Emirates.com the airline's handy mileage calculator shows some even nastier increases may be in the works including:

Booking roundtrips in business class to Europe for 90000 miles has been a major sweet spot … but the calculator shows it's now priced at 180000 Skywards miles. Yes double the miles.

One-ways in business class on either route meanwhile would jump from the current 72500 miles to a whopping 142500 miles each way.

First class across the pond would jump from 85000 miles each way to an eye-popping 168750 miles

If those increases hold up they're clearly the worst of the bunch – by far. And Emirates has clearly signaled that even more rate hikes are on the way: In a statement to One Mile at a Time the airline said increases “will be gradually introduced on reward tickets across the Emirates network between 22 December 2022 and 31 January 2023.”

“In line with current market conditions Emirates Skywards is introducing an increase on Skywards Miles required for Upgrade Rewards and Classic Rewards booked in Business Class and First Class” Emirates said defending the exorbitant increases by saying that flyers with elite status will earn more miles on select paid tickets.

This is what's called a devaluation in the points and miles world and it's a doozy. It almost makes what Delta has done with SkyMiles over the years look mild in comparison. Almost…

Consider this: You can book a one-way flight from the U.S. to nearby Doha (DOH) in Qatar Qsuites – arguably the best in the world – for just 70000 American AAdvantage miles. Or 70000 Qatar Avios. Or 70000 British Airways Avios too.

But getting to Dubai in Emirates' far inferior business class will now cost you nearly double or more: at least 138000 miles each way … and 157500 miles from the West Coast. That's not great and that's putting it mildly.



Plus Emirates' own Skywards program has become one of the only ways to actually book these premium cabin seats using miles – especially in first class. Last year the airline ended its partnership with Alaska Airlines which was once the go-to way to book Emirates First Class. And while a new partnership with Air Canada has made Aeroplan the best way to book Emirates business class that window is closing soon: Aeroplan will introduce a new (and almost certainly drastically more expensive) award chart for Emirates redemptions sometime early next year.

These hefty increases are likely driven in part by just how easy it's become to earn Emirates miles – you don't need to fly Emirates in order to rack up a bunch of miles. Emirates is a transfer partner with all major transferable points currencies: Chase Capital One American Express Citi and even Bilt Rewards. By raising their redemption rates Emirates can limit how many travelers can book these seats with points from cards like the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card or the American Express® Gold Card.

If there's one silver lining it's that we haven't yet seen any indication that Emirates will raise the requirements to upgrade to first class using miles. Will that last? Who knows. But given how many miles it'll now cost you to book a business class seat in the first place we're not sure how much of a win it would be anyway.

Bottom Line

This is bad. And by the looks of it it's only going to get worse.

Over the last few days Emirates has raised award rates by 20% to book business or first class seats on many of its flights. And in the days to come redemption rates to book Emirates first or business class between the U.S. and Europe may absolutely skyrocket by up to 100%.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vZnJlcXVlbnRtaWxlci5jb20vYW1leC1tZW1iZXJzaGlwLXJld2FyZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Express Membership Rewards Complete Guide,"Membership Rewards is American Express’ transferable points currency.

If you’re at all interested in free and/or luxury travel with points & miles then you need to understand the basics of Amex Membership Rewards. Here you’ll find everything you need to know.

How to earn Amex Membership Rewards Points

Credit Card Welcome Bonuses

The easiest and quickest way to earn Membership Rewards points is through Amex credit card welcome bonuses.

Most Amex welcome offers stipulate that you can’t get the bonus if you’ve ever had that card before. That said it doesn’t preclude you getting a bonus for a similarly named card. For example there quite a few versions of the high end Platinum card and it’s possible to get the welcome bonus with each and every one. Additionally targeted offers sometimes do not have that once per lifetime language. In those cases you can get the bonus even if you’ve had the card before. See: 8 ways to get the best targeted Amex welcome bonus offers.

Below are the Amex cards with the best current and public Membership Rewards welcome offers.

Card Offer

Credit Card Upgrade Bonuses

Amex frequently offers bonus points for upgrading from one card to another. For example we’ve seen 140000 point offers for upgrading from the Business Gold Rewards card to the Business Platinum card. Even better these upgrade offers usually do not have the once per lifetime language. That is if you are targeted for an upgrade offer you may be able to earn the bonus points even if you currently have the card or if you’ve had the card before.

Note that it’s best to accept these offers only after you have earned a signup bonus for the card that you’re upgrading to. Accepting an upgrade offer for a given card will make you ineligible to receive a new cardmember welcome bonus for that card if it contains Amex’s “once in a lifetime” language.

Shopping Portal Rewards

It is possible to earn Amex Membership Rewards points by starting your shopping with the Rakuten Shopping Portal. An option within the portal lets you choose whether you want to be paid via cash back or in Membership Rewards points.

In addition to earning points by clicking through to stores from the portal you can also register your credit cards with the portal to earn additional points at select stores and restaurants.

Credit Card Category Bonuses

Another great way to earn Membership Rewards points is by using the best card for different spending categories. If you spend a lot personally or through your business on any of the below categories you can do very well. Particularly noteworthy is the no-annual-fee Blue Business Plus Credit Card which offers 2 points per dollar for all spend up to $50K spend per calendar year (then 1X thereafter). That’s fantastic.

* The Amex EveryDay Preferred card earns a 50% bonus every billing period in which the card was used for 30 or more transactions. Before the 50% bonus the card has the following bonus categories: 3x points at US supermarkets on up to $6000 per year in purchases (then 1x); 2x points at US gas stations; 1x points on other purchases. After the 50% bonus it offers: 4.5x points at US supermarkets on up to $6000 per year in purchases (then 1.5x); 3x points at US gas stations; 1.5x points on other purchases.

** The Business Gold Card offers 4X on the two categories where your business spends the most each billing cycle from the following categories: ⚬ US purchases at restaurants ⚬ Airfare purchased directly from airlines ⚬ U.S. purchases for advertising in select media ⚬ U.S. purchases at gas stations ⚬ U.S. purchases for shipping ⚬ U.S. computer hardware software and cloud computing purchases made directly from select providers. 4X applies to first $150000 in combined purchases in your two categories each calendar year 1X point per dollar thereafter and on other purchases. Terms apply.

Credit Card Referrals

Yet another way to earn Membership Rewards points is by referring friends and relatives to an Amex credit or charge card. In some cases these referral bonuses can be substantial and Amex has offered as much as 30000 points for referring someone to another Amex card. However if you want to keep your friends then make sure that the offer they get is as good as the best available public offer (by comparing your referral offer to our Best Offers page).

Log into your account to check for any special referral offers.

Keep in mind that you can refer friends to other cards — even to cards you do not have. See this post for full details: Maximizing value from Amex multi-referrals

Amex Offers

Amex Offers are a great option for saving cash. But sometimes Amex Offers can also provide terrific opportunities for point-earning instead. One (now expired) example was an offer for Reebok: Spend $75 or more Get 1500 Membership Rewards points. And one for Hugo Boss: Spend $250 or more Get 5000 points.

Amex Offers can also be longer term and act more like a new category bonus in which you can get an extra Membership Rewards points per dollar spent at selected merchants. See: 2x Membership Rewards (2.5x with Everyday Preferred) at many online merchants.

Log into your account and check the section titled “Amex Offers and Benefits” to look for offers like these.

Other Options for Earning Amex Membership Rewards Points

Enroll in Pay Over Time

Once you sign up for an American Express charge card you will start getting emails and letters inviting you to sign up for the Pay Over Time. This option essentially turns your charge card into a credit card. Don’t do it. That is don’t sign up until the offer includes a bonus of 10000 to 30000 Membership Rewards points. In my experience these bonus offers usually appear towards the end of your first year of card membership (as long as you haven’t enrolled already).

Once you get an offer like the one shown above go ahead and sign up. As long as you keep paying your card’s complete balance each month there is no downside to enabling this feature.

even on the same card. However to have a chance of getting targeted for these offers you need to ensure the card isn’t currently enrolled in Pay Over Time. Amex doesn’t make it obvious how to do that b It’s possible to be repeatedly targeted for Pay Over Time enrollment bonuses. However to have a chance of getting targeted for these offers you need to ensure the card isn’t currently enrolled in Pay Over Time. Amex doesn’t make it obvious how to do that b ut you can see our post on how to unenroll here

FX International Payments

Amex offers businesses the ability to earn 1 Membership Rewards point per $30 of foreign wire payments (max 4000 points per transaction). Even better you may receive a welcome bonus offer like the one shown above (keep an eye out for this in your mailbox or email!).

How to Use Membership Rewards Points

In general Membership Rewards points are worth up to 1 cent each. Fortunately there are three ways in which it is possible to get more value: redeem points for flights transfer points to hotel or airline partners or invest rewards. More on each below…

Travel

Those with American Express Platinum cards automatically get 1 cent per point value when redeeming points for travel. That’s not particularly good but it’s much better than the value that people get without a Platinum card. Currently the only way to get better than 1 cent per point value when redeeming points for travel is with the Business Platinum Card.

The Business Platinum Card offers a 35% Airline Bonus: Get 35% of your points back when you redeem points through Amex Travel for either a First or Business class flight on any airline or for any flights with your selected airline.

After you receive the 35% rebate the value works out to 1.54 cents per point. That’s very good but it does require owning this ultra-premium card.

Transfer Points to Partners

The best use of Membership Rewards points in my opinion is to transfer them to airline and hotel partners in order to book high value awards. Your best bet is usually to wait until you find a great award before transferring points. One exception: Amex often offers 30% or higher transfer bonuses to certain programs (Virgin Atlantic and British Airways are two recent examples). If you’re confident that you’ll use the points for good value it may make sense to transfer points when those bonuses are in effect.

Points can be transferred to the loyalty accounts of the primary cardholder or any authorized user or employee on the account.

For specific examples of great ways to use points transferred to airline miles please see: Amex Membership Rewards sweet spots.

List of Membership Rewards Transfer Partners

It is free to transfer Membership Rewards points to foreign airlines. For transfers to US airlines however Amex charges an “excise tax offset fee” of $0.0006 per point (with a maximum fee of $99). Airlines subject to this fee are noted below.

Current Partner Transfer Bonuses

Here are the currently available transfer bonuses from Amex Membership Rewards (this table will update automatically when new offers are found):

Cash back (invest with rewards)

The best way to get cash back is to add the American Express Platinum Card for Schwab to your credit card portfolio. This card offers a benefit called “Invest with Rewards.” This allows the cardholder to deposit Membership Rewards points into a Schwab account at a value of 1.1 cents per point. For example 50000 points becomes $550.

Considering the fact that there are so many ways to earn lots of Membership Rewards points the ability to cash out at 1.1 cents per point isn’t too bad.

Note that the Morgan Stanley Platinum card also offers Invest with Rewards but only at a value of 1 cent per point.

Amex Business Checking is another way to cash out Membership Rewards but there is a bit of a catch though. The standard rate is only 0.8 cents per point which is something no one should consider doing. There is an increased rate of 1 cent per point possible but in order to get it you must also hold a Business Platinum card (and the $695 annual fee that comes with it). Also that improved rate is limited to a maximum of 1000000 points redeemed per year while the standard rate of 0.8 cents per point is unlimited.

Other ways to redeem Membership Rewards Points

You can also redeem points for gift cards or merchandise. At most with this approach you’ll get 1 cent per point value but usually you’ll get quite a bit less.

You can also use points to pay some merchants directly (Amazon.com for example). Don’t do this. These options offer very poor value. Further they may compromise the security of your account (i.e. if someone hacks into your Amazon account they might spend your Membership Rewards points – causing you a headache in getting your points reinstated).

Amex Membership Rewards Travel Sweet Spots

Our post Amex Membership Rewards sweet spots details the best value uses of Amex Membership Rewards. Either click here or click below to jump to a section of the post:

Managing Membership Rewards

Combine Points Across Cards

Amex automatically pools all of your points together. When you earn points with different cards the point total shown when viewing either card is the total across cards.

Share Points Across Cardholders

Unlike Chase and Citibank Amex doesn’t allow members to move points from one person’s account to another. That said it is possible to transfer one person’s points to another person’s loyalty program account. The key is that the person who receives the points must be an authorized user or employee on the other person’s account. For example my wife can transfer Membership Rewards points to my Virgin Atlantic account as long as I’m an authorized user (or employee) on any of her Membership Rewards cards.

In order to use this method to share points the authorized user card must be active for 90 days before it will unlock the ability to transfer your points to the authorized user’s loyalty program account.

How to Preserve a Deceased Person’s Points

If a person with Amex Membership Rewards points dies the executor of the estate or an authorized account manager can request to transfer their Membership Rewards points to another person or to redeem points in any other way (e.g. transfer to loyalty program redeem for gift cards etc.). Full details can be found here.

How to Keep Points Alive

Thankfully it is very easy to keep Amex Membership Rewards points alive. Simply keep any Membership Rewards card open. For example if you are about to close your one and only Membership Rewards card then open another Membership Rewards card account first in order to preserve your points. Amex offers some no-fee Membership Rewards cards such as the Blue Business Plus and the Amex Everyday so this shouldn’t be much of a burden.

But the authorities are set to unveil a newly built $1.5 billion city a project that officials claim “reflects the rapid socioeconomic development” in the Central Asian nation.



The new city -- Arkadag or Protector -- draws its name from the formal title of Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov the authoritarian leader who stepped down in March after ruling the country with an iron fist for over 15 years.



Berdymukhammedov handed power to his son Serdar in a managed election. But the 65-year-old remains a top official as the chairman of the upper house of parliament and continues to wield considerable influence.

Located around 30 kilometers southwest of the capital Ashgabat Arkadag will serve as the capital of Akhal Province which is situated along the border with Iran and Afghanistan.



Construction of the project began in 2019 the same year that Serdar Berdymukhammedov’s was appointed as governor of Akhal.



Over the course of the project the younger Bedymukhammedov became the minister of industry and construction materials and deputy chairman of the cabinet before succeeding his father as president.



In April Serdar Berdymukhammedov called for a “public discussion” to find a name for the new city.

Sure enough the speaker of Turkmenistan’s lower house of parliament duly announced the city’s name on December 21 claiming that “the wishes of residents of all regions” and the “suggestions of public organizations” had been taken into account.

But sources told RFE/RL’s Turkmen Service in May that the name was already decided.



Turkmenistan watchers scoff at the notion that the city-naming was an exercise in democracy.



“There is no trace of a public campaign. How did they ask the opinion of people in these regions where there is no Internet where even mobile penetration is low?” asked Luca Anceschi professor of Eurasian Studies at the University of Glasgow. “The name of the city is an illusion. The city itself is an illusion.”

'Far Away From Food Queues'

Arkadag does not resemble most cities or even provincial capitals in Turkmenistan.

Footage shown on state media suggests it will have more in common with central Ashgabat where billions of dollars generated from gas exports have funded the construction of ostentatious buildings with white marble facades even as other parts of the country bear the brunt of a prolonged economic crisis.

Arkadag has been hailed by Turkmen authorities as a “smart city” which will host a hippodrome a children’s rehabilitation center named after the former president and a statue of the ex-leader. One of the central streets in the city will be named after the patriarch’s favorite horse Akhan.



The city is designed to house more than 12000 families.



Ruslan Myatiev the editor of the Europe-based exile-run Turkmen.News website says Arkadag will accommodate members of the elite and those with ties to the ruling Berdymukhammedov family.



Myatiev said this fits the general pattern of the Berdymukhammedovs keeping members of their extended clan separate from the general population and “far away from food queues” that have become common amid rising poverty and food shortages.

“At the moment the relatives -- a very broad term that includes even very distant relatives -- have occupied a number of neighborhoods built with state money in and around Ashgabat” said the journalist.



In contrast “since about 2015 the general population of Turkmenistan has been living with no clear vision of tomorrow” Myatiev added.

'Instruments Of Corruption'

Despite all evidence to the contrary Turkmen state propaganda has claimed a never-ending procession of economic successes.

An exception came last year when the elder Berdymukhammedov then president acknowledged that the state was struggling to repay its foreign creditors on time.

The reality is that the government is also struggling to pay the salaries of public sector employees on time including the construction workers building Arkadag according to a report by RFE/RL’s Turkmen Service in September.

Earlier this month residents of some neighborhoods in Ashgabat told RFE/RL that they had been left without water and heating during a cold snap.



In November RFE/RL’s Turkmen Service reported a sharp growth in the market for secondhand clothes and used household items in Turkmenabat the capital of eastern Lebap Province.



“When you go around to people’s houses you see that they have put up for sale half of their belongings just to survive to buy bread” one Turkmenabat resident told RFE/RL’s Turkmen Service.



Turkmenistan’s energy-dependent economy took a nosedive after global oil and gas prices plunged in 2014 and Russia ceased imports in 2016.



Recently global energy prices have recovered Russia has resumed buying some Turkmen gas and top client China in the first nine months of this year purchased more than $7 billion worth of the fuel according to Chinese customs data.



But that has not fueled an economic recovery in Turkmenistan where the state has prioritized spending on multibillion-dollar vanity projects despite chronic food shortages and price hikes.



Widespread poverty corruption and unemployment have forced millions of Turkmen to leave the country in recent decades.



“You have a new city in a country where the population is shrinking whatever official statistics claim. You have a new airport that costs over $2 billion in a country that has no tourism and which is trying to stop its citizens from fleeing the country” said Anceschi of the University of Glasgow.

“Everything is backwards but what we can be sure of is that somebody is making an awful lot of money off these projects. Because they are instruments of corruption” he said.

There is little hope of a change in direction. President Serdar Berdymukhammedov has pledged to “follow the course” set by his father.

The younger Berdymukhammedov has only had good things to say about Arkadag a project that he has led.



“There are currently few countries in the world that are building and commissioning an entire city” Berdymukhammedov said in April. “This indicates the growing economic potential of the Motherland the good training of our specialists.”"

“5 Questions With…” is a recurring BioBuzz series where we reach out to interesting people to share a little about themselves their work and maybe something completely unrelated. This week we welcome Marné Garretson Scientist at Cardinal Health a distributor of pharmaceuticals a global manufacturer and distributor of medical and laboratory products and a provider of performance and data solutions for health care facilities.

As a Scientist within Cardinal Health’s Real-World Evidence & Insights specialty business Marné Garretson provides subject matter expertise supporting a portfolio of health outcomes research studies examining clinical outcomes and demonstrating value for specialty therapies. Prior to joining Cardinal Health Marné has had a variety of professional experiences in the applications of epidemiological research methods biostatistics and project management in addition to research experiences that have provided her with opportunities to serve as a thought leader.

1) Please introduce yourself to our audience by looking back at your education training and career.

My passion for the scientific method and research process has been fueled by my personal desire to seek to understand the “why” behind the “what.” My Grandmother fondly recounts that as a young child I would incessantly ask “why” questions to better understand my surroundings even for the most mundane activities. My career interests in the sciences were ignited through my participation in the Distance Learning Center’s STEMM (Science Technology Engineering Math and Medicine) PREP Project a longitudinal training continuum and multi-institutional mentorship program designed to produce multiple generations of minority researchers in STEMM. I was selected to participate in this program in 7th grade and was provided with opportunities to take graduate level STEMM courses with rotating summer internships in collaborating institutions’ basic science engineering and technology labs. Through this program I cultivated lifelong friendships and was supported in building the foundation for my career as a Scientist. While I enjoyed my experiences working in bench science I was exposed to the intersectionality of public health through my undergraduate studies and decided to pursue Epidemiology as a field of specialty while in graduate school.

Through my graduate studies at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health I was equipped with sound methodological training in epidemiology operations analysis and outcomes research. During my masters-level training I was provided with an opportunity to intern at the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA) on a project designed to combat the continuing threat of the multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (M[X]DR-TB) and HIV co-infection epidemic in KwaZulu-Natal South Africa. Working alongside South African epidemiologists clinicians and scientists we sought to bridge an evidence gap and complement previous research by describing trends in gender HIV status refusal of HIV testing and M(X)DR-TB prevalence for all patients with M(X)DR-TB presenting to care at King DinuZulu Hospital (KDZ) over a 12-year study period. This research experience was transformative for me personally and professionally and ignited my interest to explore health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) as a discipline.

My interest in pharmaceutical health services research arose from witnessing communities being affected by the downstream impacts from their lack of representation in clinical trial research. In my role at the NYC Department of Health & Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) I served as a Principal Investigator responsible for the design management and implementation of a portfolio of health outcomes studies to monitor health behavior trends and associations with social and structural factors related to sexual health care and HIV prevention and transmission. While working in this capacity Descovy for PrEP was approved by the FDA to prevent HIV for people at risk through sex; however it was not recommended for cisgender women as they were excluded from the clinical trials. The decision to exclude this demographic limited the approved indication to men only thereby reinforcing evidence gaps and disparities in access to this health promotion tool as Descovy’s safety and effectiveness in women is unknown.

While this approval was an advancement for HIV prevention for some this novel biomedical intervention remained inaccessible to many that face a disproportionate burden of HIV diagnoses in the United States. Engaging with Black and Latina women in my capacity at the NYC DOHMH and understanding trends in PrEP awareness and use among these communities in NYC I felt the sense of disregard that is perceived by many as access to health promotion and prevention tools are prioritized for some communities while other communities are denied this same access. This was disheartening. Given my experience in conducting observational research I was very keen on finding opportunities to leverage my interests and professional training while closing gaps in health disparities through working to advance representation of medically underserved communities in clinical research. This experience was the catalyst for my career transition to the discipline of pharmaceutical Real-World Evidence.

In my current role as a Scientist I support the design and implementation of innovative Real-World Data (RWD) and Real-World Evidence (RWE) strategies and activities to produce scientific evidence to demonstrate clinical effectiveness publications to inform product strategy decisions for our pharmaceutical clients and demonstrate value for payers providers and patients.

2) You have an extensive background in the Life Sciences spanning almost 13 years. What is one skill or lesson you learned early on that you still utilize today?

At various points throughout my professional career I can recall internalizing many of my failed experiments while not realizing that this was a necessary part of the research process. In recounting these experiences the biggest lesson I’ve learned has centered on building tolerance for failure. I have learned that the value of failure is to actively engage with our limits of understanding and probe for our blind spots. In uncovering those blind spots you are then gifted with an opportunity to change your course of action or continue with the status quo. In learning this lesson I had to change my perspective and use failure as a heuristic tool to embrace the experimental nature of life and conceive of viable alternatives to achieve any desired outcome. In reframing my perspective I have cultivated resilience enforced my sense of self-trust and embraced my failures as a “necessary evil” for growth. One phrase that I continue to tell myself to reinforce this perspective shift is “everything in life is an experiment and every failure is a learning opportunity.”

3) You have been with Cardinal Health for about 10 months. What were some of the significant factors that made you want to be a part of the team initially?

One of the most significant factors that made me want to be a part of the team initially was the transparent and engaging interview process. During the interview process I enjoyed the open and direct conversations where I was able to share my professional experiences that shaped my transferrable skillset discuss my 5-year career goals and describe what I can offer to this role and team. Additionally my interview panel was transparent and provided me with great detail in describing the function and expectations of this role and how I would be interfacing with cross-functional teams and our clients. My interview process exemplified Cardinal Health’s core values of accountability and integrity.

Upon joining the RWE team I immediately observed Cardinal Health’s mission-driven values in action. Across all functions in Insights & Engagements we are genuinely committed to making a difference for our customers and communities as we strive to develop innovative products and services that make healthcare safer and more productive.

As I have grown in my role as a Scientist my colleagues have demonstrated that they not only value my work products but also my contributions as a person on an individual level. In this capacity I have taken on “stretch assignments” that have challenged my methodological skillset while also having leadership support to leverage my diverse professional experiences to deliver results for our customers.

4) Working at Cardinal Health as a Scientist you are very hands on with the research of a product and analytical study of the results achieved. What clinical research project meant the most to you over the time you have spent with your team?

I have had the fortunate experience to support a study designed to characterize patient-centric outcomes among patients with Follicular Lymphoma (FL). This was a patient-reported outcomes (PRO) study that leveraged evidence-based questionnaires to assess patient satisfaction with treatment quality of life and work productivity across various subgroups of interest. I enjoyed the opportunity to apply my skillset and previous experiences working with patient-reported outcomes to examine social and structural factors that impact treatment options and survival outcomes for patients living with FL in the real-world setting. As part of this study we were able to translate our research findings into peer-reviewed abstracts and manuscripts to assist communication efforts of value proposition for patients providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

I personally love the richness in data and insights that PRO studies can generate to elucidate the impact of a medical condition and provide evidence of efficacy and tolerability of a particular treatment from a patient perspective. The value of PRO data generated in the real-world setting can provide insights directly from the patient to understand what happens outside of the clinical setting with implications for post-market surveillance compliance with regulatory requirements and considerations for expanding an indication profile for a product.

5) You’re stranded on a deserted island and have to survive until rescue arrives. What 3 people would you choose to help aid you in survival?

If I was stranded on a deserted island my dream team to help aid in my survival would be Jason Statham Barack Obama and Alexis Nikole Nelson. I chose these individuals after careful deliberation for the following reasons: Jason’s invaluable MMA training and survival skills may come in handy if we have to fight for our lives; our former President’s negotiation and problem-solving skills will help us get out of any prickly conversations; and Alexis’s foraging know-how to show us how to live off the land to sustain our nutritional needs until rescue arrives!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbnoubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9uZXdzL2ludmVzY28tcC11bHRyYS1kaXZpZGVuZC1yZXZlbnVlLTExMjAxMTQ5OC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Should Invesco S&P Ultra Dividend Revenue ETF (RDIV) Be on Your Investing Radar?,"Designed to provide broad exposure to the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market the Invesco S&P Ultra Dividend Revenue ETF (RDIV) is a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 10/01/2013.

The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $982.26 million making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.

Why Large Cap Value

Companies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.

While value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios they also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets when you consider long-term performance growth stocks are more likely to outpace value stocks in strong bull markets.

Costs

When considering an ETF's total return expense ratios are an important factor and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.

Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.39% putting it on par with most peer products in the space.

It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.44%.

Sector Exposure and Top Holdings

ETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.

This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 22.10% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Utilities round out the top three.

Looking at individual holdings Cardinal Health Inc (CAH) accounts for about 5.65% of total assets followed by Valero Energy Corp (VLO) and Chevron Corp (CVX).

The top 10 holdings account for about 49.11% of total assets under management.

Performance and Risk

RDIV seeks to match the performance of the OFI Revenue Weighted Ultra Dividend Index before fees and expenses. The S&P 900 Dividend Revenue-Weighted Index is constructed using a rules-based methodology that starts with the S&P 900 Index subject to a maximum 5% per company weighting.

The ETF has gained about 6.60% so far this year and is up roughly 8.81% in the last one year (as of 12/26/2022). In the past 52-week period it has traded between $37.70 and $46.24.

The ETF has a beta of 1.09 and standard deviation of 32.21% for the trailing three-year period making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 61 holdings it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.

Alternatives

Invesco S&P Ultra Dividend Revenue ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold) which is based on expected asset class return expense ratio and momentum among other factors. Thus RDIV is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.

The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $53.90 billion in assets Vanguard Value ETF has $97.80 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.

Bottom-Line

Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs transparency flexibility and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.

New Institute for Health Computing Coming to Montgomery County Maryland

Sponsored by ECBuild / EwingCole

Montgomery County the University of Maryland Baltimore the University of Maryland College Park and the University of Maryland Medical System Corporation announced today an exciting Memorandum of Understanding to create The University of Maryland 3 – Institute for Health Computing or UM-3-IHC which will be located in North Bethesda.

The Institute will be a new epicenter for world-class artificial intelligence machine learning and clinical analytics research that seeks to leverage the power of data science to benefit human health and well being. The Institute’s research will be empowered by the unique de-identified HIPAA compliant data sets provided by the 12 hospitals that comprise the University of Maryland Medical System.

The Institute is the first step in an ambitious and visionary project to transform an underdeveloped North Bethesda area into a national hub for computational science-enabled biomedical research population health and precision medicine.

Montgomery County and its partners hope to redevelop the North Bethesda site which is serviced by the Metro Red Line into a mixed-use life sciences hub that will be a collision space not only for Institute researchers but also for the deep data science ecosystem in the surrounding area that includes the FDA the NIH NIST USAMRIID AHRQ Walter Reed the Naval Medical Research Center. The Institute and subsequent redevelopment of the North Bethesda area will act as a catalyst connector and job creator for industry researchers scientists and University of Maryland system students including those studying at the Universities at Shady Grove.

Pending omnibus budget approval Montgomery County has committed $40M to support the Institute project over six years (starting in 2023) with the partner universities committing to fund a similar amount of the project including an initial $25M investment from MPower the strategic partnership between UMD Baltimore and UMD College Park. The Institute partners will also seek Maryland state funding for the initiative as well.

The Institute is already recruiting principal investigators and the project expects to eventually add approximately 100 staff which will be a mix of data scientists researchers and students.

The new Institute will anchor what Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich sees as a transformational initiative that will have national impact and could potentially become the “Silicon Valley” of AI and Digital Healthcare.

This is an exciting announcement for the BioHealth Capital Region as it adds a new and different asset to an already thriving ecosystem that includes great research institutes a vibrant cell/gene therapy industry a burgeoning advanced biomanufacturing infrastructure and rising medtech and medical device sectors.

The company suffered an 86% profit decline in the last stretch of this year thanks to wavering consumer interest in the used-vehicle market high inflation and an ever increasing interest rate. In this it joins its competitor Carvana who is now facing concerns of bankruptcy in the latter half of 2023.

To save money CarMax will freeze job hiring and cancel its plans to buy stocks from its shareholders. Earlier this year the retailer noted it had also slowed down inventory purchases in response to the challenging market.

Used-car sellers performed extremely well during 2020 and 2021 as automakers were forced to cease production of new vehicles due to supply and labor shortages. Unable to find the products they wanted consumers flocked to retailers such as CarMax and Carvana who saw record sales as a result. Thinking that the heightened interest would persist into 2022 both brands purchased large and costly inventories to sustain their projected demand. However while recoveries were admittedly modest automakers were slowly able to replenish new car inventories as their dealers worked to offer generous discounts and services to attract buyers. Now with more options would-be car owners abandoned the pre-owned market leaving the industry with a vehicle surplus it was unable to sell or pay off.

That being said while CarMax and the rest of the used-car market have struggled in the latter half of 2022 no sector of the auto industry is doing well. Dealership sentiments are at an all time low while executives discuss the possibility of a recession in the first quarter of 2023. Although a normalization is likely to arrive soon those within the business should see the last two years as a learning opportunity so that they can navigate future calamities with ease.

Weinstein said that the company didn’t expect to take delivery of any new ships in 2026 and beyond that would only build or two ships a year going forward.

“Going forward we are committed to using our expected cash flow strength to repair the balance sheet over time and we’ll be disciplined and rigorous in making newbuild decisions accordingly” he said.

“We have just four ships on order through 2025 plus our second incredible Seabourn luxury expedition ship to be delivered in 2023.

“This is our lowest order book in decades” Weinstein continued. “We don’t expect any new ships in 2026 and anticipate just one or two new builds each year for several years thereafter.”

Left on the Carnival orderbook through 2025 are the Carnival Jubilee Cunard’s Queen Anne the Sun Princess another Princess newbuild that has yet to be named and the Seabourn Pursuit.

No newbuilds are on order for the company’s other brands including Holland America Line AIDA Cruises P&O Cruises and P&O Cruises Australia. Carnival’s joint venture with China State Shipbuilding Corporation was not mentioned.

With more old ships exiting combined with recent deliveries and the upcoming newbuild schedule the company expects about 25 percent of its capacity to be what it considers new ships in 2023.

That means an eight-percentage point increase in balcony cabins across the fleet and differentiated onboard experiences resulting in greater onboard revenue.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL2Nhcm5pdmFsLWNydWlzZS1saW5lLXNwZWNpYWx0eS1kaW5pbmctdmVudWUtdm90ZWQtYmVzdC1vZi0yMDIyLzkxMjgz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival Cruise Line Specialty Dining Venue Voted Best of 2022,"Carnival Cruise Line’s Cucina del Capitano has been voted the Best Specialty Dining Venue in the 2022 Cruise Ship Awards. The dining venue received more votes than venues from rival cruise lines including from Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line.

Cucina del Capitano is Best Cruise Line Specialty Dining Venue of 2022

The popular specialty dining venue has come out on top in Cruise Hive’s annual Cruise Ship Awards. Cucina del Capitano an Italian-spired restaurant featured on many Carnival cruise ships came first. The venue received more votes than over 20 other specialty dining venues including those from rival lines.

With Cucina del Capitano coming in with the most votes for first place it was much closer behind. Norwegian Cruise Line’s Cagney’s Steakhouse just marginally received more votes than third place Jamie’s Italian featured on Royal Caribbean cruise ships.

Voting in this year’s awards began in September with Cruise Hvie readers able to cast just a single vote in each of the eight categories. In this specific category readers could type in their nominations so that all specialty dining venues would have a chance of winning. Any suspicious votes and repeats from the same IP were not counted.

This now makes the second award that Carnival Cruise Line has won. The Miami-based cruise line already came out on top with its Mardi Gras vessel becoming the Best Overall Cruise Ship of 2022.

What is Cucina del Capitano?

Cucina del Capitano is a popular Italian-inspired specialty restaurant on select Carnival Cruise Line ships. It’s a dining experience that even features the traditional red and white checkered tablecloth.

Guests can expect to enjoy well-known Italian dishes such as Pollo Parmigiana Della Cucina Linguino Cavatelli and more. Each ship also features a signature dish “inspired by the Captain’s treasured family recipe that’s been handled down for generations” as mentioned on the menu.

Currently the specialty dining venue is featured on 10 Carnival cruise ships including Carnival Breeze Carnival Celebration Carnival Horizon Carnival Magic Carnival Panorama Carnival Radiance Carnival Sunrise Carnival Sunshine Carnival Vista and Mardi Gras. Guests are not required to make a reservation but it’s recommended to do so before the cruise in case the venue fills up.

Cucina del Capitano is not part of the cruise price and costs an additional $18 per adult and $6 for kids 11 years old and under. However there is no cost on the new Excel-class vessels including Mardi Gras and the new Carnival Celebration.

T'way Air Co. launched a new flight route linking Incheon with Sydney Australia embarking into the long-haul flight sector.T'way said on Sunday it has begun operating regular flights four times a week starting with flight TW501 to Sydney which departed Incheon International Airport on Dec. 23.The new T'way flight departs Incheon at 10:20 pm on Mondays Wednesdays Fridays and Saturdays and arrives in Sydney at 10:45 am the next day. From Sydney it departs on Tuesdays Thursdays Saturdays and Sundays at 12:15 pm and arrives at Incheon at 9:05 pm.In Feb. 2020 T'way Air became the first South Koean low-cost carrier to secure traffic rights for the Incheon-Sydney route. Since then it has prepared for its inaugural long-distance flight by introducing the Airbus 330-300 aircraft and signing a unit load device (ULD) contract to improve cargo transport efficiency.The A330-300 being used on the Incheon-Sydney route has 335 economy class seats with 32 inches (81 cm) of legroom and 12 business-saver class seats with premium flatbed seats that can be extended up to 165 degrees.Seo-Woo Jang at suwu@hankyung.com",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2F1dG9tb3RpdmUvdm9sa25lci1sYWZlcnJhcmktcnYtbW9zdC1leHBlbnNpdmUtMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Most expensive RV of 2022: $5-million LaFerrari carrier with roof deck,"Every year one motorhome stands above the rest in terms of its truly outrageous no-expense-spared build spec and price tag. It usually comes down to a battle between the two German Vs – Volkner and Variomobil. Volkner takes the prize again in 2022 and while this year's 39-foot (12-m) Performance S doesn't quite hit the US$7.7 million high the company reached last year it's arguably a nicer overall package thanks to additions like a large rooftop deck floor plan-wide surround sound system and coffee-and-cocktails bar. The LaFerrari that finds a cozy home between the front and rear axles isn't bad either.

Volkner exhibited this particular Performance S earlier this year at the 2022 Düsseldorf Caravan Salon where it attracted hordes of visitors with its Halloween-like orange-and-black paint job and contrasting pure-white LaFerrari hanging out of its gut. Along with the Action Mobil Global XRS 7400 it was definitely the largest most gawk-worthy spectacle of the show. But while the Action Mobil could be had for a mere €1.1 million the Performance S required buyers to cough up nearly twice that – just over €2 million (approx. US$2.1 million). Add in the cost of that LaFerrari and the price more than doubled to over €5.3 million (US$5.7 million).

Based on that breakdown the LaFerrari costs roughly the same €3 million as last year's Bugatti Chiron so the $2 million price difference ultimately comes down to the motorhome spec and a current exchange rate that's much kinder to the US dollar. We'd say that makes this year's Performance S a comparative bargain because it definitely isn't lacking in amenities. In fact it has some interesting options previous Performance S show models did not starting with its 135-sq-ft (12.5-sq-m) rooftop deck admittedly a little awkward to get to via a ladder in the bathroom shower. The deck is designed to seat six to eight for stargazing spectating people watching and general fresh air relaxation.

Volkner Performance S roof deck Volkner

The remainder of the roof is dedicated to practical equipment including the 2000-W solar panel array satellite dish 4G antenna and dual air conditioning system. Dedicated large and small air conditioners are installed for cooling the front living area and rear bedroom respectively.

The custom Performance S interior features a unique layout we haven't seen before. In particular the high L-shaped kitchen counter with barstools on the outside feels more like something you'd see in a (stationary) home or on a yacht creating the perfect space for owners to enjoy coffee and a light breakfast in the morning and wine or cocktails in the evening. On the other side of that bar top the kitchen area comes stocked with a three-burner induction cooktop oven microwave dishwasher and refrigerator with separate 12-bottle wine cooler.

The custom floor plan includes a front daybed and a two-person bar Volkner

Also unique is the use of a daybed instead of a basic sofa in the front living area. This bed makes use of the driver-side wall slide-out for proper spacing.

The main 71 x 79-in (180 x 200-cm) bed is located in the rear bedroom. It would appear the buyer behind this particular build spends a lot of time sitting up while reading working or web surfing because the bed has a tall cushioned headrest which replaces the window that would otherwise be visible there.

Instead of Volkner's usual Burmester audio system the customer specced out their own custom sound system with speakers throughout including 5.1 surround sound in the living area. LED smart TVs in the living room and bedroom supply the picture to go along with the audio. A 20-kWh lithium battery bank charged with the help of the aforementioned solar array powers those electronics and other interior electrical equipment.

This Performance S is built atop a Volvo bus chassis with 503-hp rear engine and air suspension system. Its €5311000 final price including taxes made it the most expensive motorhome at the 2022 Caravan Salon and the most expensive RV we here at New Atlas covered all year — by a very comfortable margin.

iECURE CEO Joe Truitt (Source: iECURE)

A $65 million infusion of cash will enable gene editing company iECURE to take its lead asset for Ornithine Transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency into the clinic within the next 18 months

Philadelphia-based iECURE which is collaborating with Jim Wilson’s Gene Therapy Program (GTP) at University of Pennsylvania secured $65 million in Series A-1 financing to support its knock-in gene editing therapeutics for liver disorders. Combined with $50 million raised in a previous Series A round iECURE is well-financed to take its lead asset GTP-506 into the clinic.

Chief Executive Officer Joe Truitt explained that iECURE’s approach to gene editing is different than those taken by other companies. Instead of knocking out or modifying a defective gene iECURE is using in vivo gene insertion to insert full healthy donor genes into the liver of the patient. Truitt said iECURE wants to use its approach to address diseases that have to do where there is a loss of function or no function in a gene “where the genes aren’t doing what they’re supposed to be doing.”

iECURE’s lead program is aimed at OTC deficiency the most common urea cycle disorder. OTC is caused by a genetic defect in a liver enzyme responsible for detoxification of ammonia. The buildup of ammonia can lead to devastating consequences including irreversible neurological damage coma and death. OTC is most commonly seen in newborn children and currently the only treatment for early onset severe OTC deficiency is a liver transplant.

GTP-506 is designed to insert a donor OTC gene into the liver of an infant in order to deliver the necessary genetic correction so the child can live a full and healthy life Truitt said. The gene therapy relies on the use of the ARCUS nuclease to cut the genome at the well-characterized PCSK9 site. Then a healthy gene delivered via an adeno-associated virus will be delivered to the target.

The company has accumulated significant animal data that shows the gene editing program can successfully deliver the donor OTC gene. The company also has data showing a durable effect in the treated primates Truitt added.

Now the company aims to replicate those same results in human patients Truitt said.

“Based on the data we have in the non-human primates we have a legitimate chance of translating those results into humans” Truitt said.

Ahead of entering the clinic iECURE has been working closely with gene therapy giant Jim Wilson and the Gene Therapy Program (GTP) at University of Pennsylvania to develop its own platform. Truitt touted Wilson and his team for laying the groundwork in the gene editing field groundwork that has resulted so far in the approval of multiple gene therapy treatments for rare diseases including several this year alone.

The company has established manufacturing partnerships with both Catalent in Maryland and the Center for Breakthrough Medicines which is where Wilson’s program is now located.

Truitt said he anticipates the filing an Investigational New Drug application with the FDA in the third quarter of 2023. If it is accepted Truitt believes iECURE can dose the first patients by the end of the year with first readouts expected in early 2024. The FDA has granted both Orphan Drug Designation and Rare Pediatric Designation to GTP-506 for the treatment of OTC deficiency.

Beyond GTP-506 iECURE also has two other assets in development. One is for a urea cycle disorder known as citrullinemia type 1 a genetic condition caused by the lack of an enzyme involved in excreting excess nitrogen from the body and the other is in phenylketonuria (PKU) a metabolic disease caused by a genetic defect that leaves patients unable to break down a particular amino acid one of the building blocks of proteins. Left untreated the amino acid phenylalanine builds up in the body and causes severe developmental problems and long-term health issues. Truitt anticipated the identification of these clinical candidates next year.

In addition to the advancement of iECURE’s lead therapy and development of the company’s other assets the $65 million in financing will also enable the company to double its current headcount of 12 employees. Truitt said iECURE will need to onboard multiple employees for various roles as they move closer to the clinic. The Series A-1 was co-led by Novo Holdings A/S and LYFE Capital. There was also significant participation from existing investors Versant Ventures and OrbiMed Advisors both of whom led the company’s $50 million Series A round. Having such renowned investors who conducted their due diligence ahead of contributing their resources provides validation for iECURE’s platform Truitt said.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Snow-walking caterpillars are the latest example of Maine’s extreme weather

By Julia Bayly Bangor Daily News Staff First came the snow. Then came the caterpillars.

By Julia Bayly Bangor Daily News Staff

First came the snow. Then came the caterpillars.

The caterpillars — the larval stage of the yellow underwing moth — have been in Maine since the 1970s lurking below the snow every winter. But their unexpected activity over the weekend left folks around the state taking to social media asking about the black caterpillars crawling on top of the fresh snow.

Commonly called winter cutworms the caterpillars are able to withstand cold temperatures and spend their winters feeding on grasses roots and other herbaceous plants according to Jim Dill pest management specialist with University of Maine Cooperative Extension.

They are a gregarious species — for a caterpillar — traveling and feeding in groups. Which helps to explain why people were reporting seeing scores of them on the snow this past weekend.

Dill suspects the cutworms were especially active in the days leading up to the storm last week because the weather had been so unseasonably mild. The caterpillars are the latest example of weather extremes here in Maine that are changing the typical behaviors of local animals and plants.

“Think of it we had green grass until very recently” Dill said. “Then just like that they got caught on top of the snow.”

For the cutworms that were not able to burrow back down to the ground beneath the snow they likely died either from freezing or becoming an easy meal.

“If there were any birds around they would have seen the cutworms” Dill said. “The birds would have easily spotted these black worms on white snow and then wham-bang gotten them.”

Yellow underwing moths are a relatively recent invasive species in Maine according to Dill. They are native to Europe and first showed up in Maritime Canada and New England in the 1970s.

Out west they are considered a potential pest due to fears they could cause considerable damage to crops in a short amount of time according to the Oregon State Extension Service.

How much damage the cutworm stage of the moth could cause depends largely on their numbers and specific environmental conditions.

So far there is no indication gardeners or growers here have anything to worry about.

“Yes if you get them in high enough numbers they can be a pest” he said. “But so far we are not getting those numbers in Maine.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maXJzdHBvc3QuY29tL2V4cGxhaW5lcnMvZXhwbGFpbmVkLXdoYXQtaXMtY29yZHljZXBzLWZ1bmd1cy13aGljaC1jaGluZXNlLWFybXktaW50cnVkZWQtaW50by1pbmRpYW4tdGVycml0b3J5LXRvLWZpbmQtMTE4NzY4OTEuaHRtbNIBkwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maXJzdHBvc3QuY29tL2V4cGxhaW5lcnMvZXhwbGFpbmVkLXdoYXQtaXMtY29yZHljZXBzLWZ1bmd1cy13aGljaC1jaGluZXNlLWFybXktaW50cnVkZWQtaW50by1pbmRpYW4tdGVycml0b3J5LXRvLWZpbmQtMTE4NzY4OTEuaHRtbC9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What is Cordyceps fungus which Chinese Army intruded into Indian territory to find?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.firstpost.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /explainers/explained-what-is-cordyceps-fungus-which-chinese-army-intruded-into-indian-territory-to-find-11876891.html (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021223BA4490>, 'Connection to www.firstpost.com timed out.

Cordyceps also known as caterpillar fungus or the Himalayan gold is an expensive herbal medicine in China.

An IPCSC report has accused Chinese soldiers of illegally entering Arunachal Pradesh in search of the fungus – mainly found in the Indian Himalayas and on the high altitude region of the plateau in southwestern China.

Globally in 2022 Cordyceps market has been valued at $1072.50 million and China is its largest producer as well as exporter.

According to IPCSC Cordyceps harvest has waned in China in the last few years which resulted in shortage of this medicinal fungus.

It is brown in colour and is up to two inches long. It is found in the Himalayan regions at an altitude of three to five thousand meters.

In India it is known as ‘Kida Jadi’ while in Nepal and China it is called ‘Yarsagumba’ while in Tibet its name is ‘Yarsaganbu’.

Cordyceps’ scientific name is ‘Ophiocordyceps sinensis’ while in English it is called ‘caterpillar fungus’.

It's tough knowing where to invest right now. The stock market has been in the doldrums all year and 2023 isn't looking much better. There are serious concerns that the Federal Reserve will push interest rates too high and cause a steep economic downturn.

But if we look past all this uncertainty we can see a few longer-term growth trends that should remain strong over the coming years. Three of the biggest megatrends are:

Decarbonization : The economy is transitioning to lower-carbon energy sources.

Digitization : Businesses are undergoing digital transformation initiatives to bring more of their business processes online.

Deglobalization : Countries are shifting their supply chains onshore to improve their resilience.

Because of that companies working to capitalize on these themes should thrive in the coming years. That's why the best place to invest $5000 (or any other amount) is across these megatrends. Here are five companies aligning their businesses to capitalize on one or more of these themes.

The data infrastructure leader

American Tower (AMT -1.01%) is one of the largest global real estate investment trusts (REITs). The company operates 222000 communications sites worldwide and over two dozen U.S. data centers.

This infrastructure is crucial for increased digitization. Growing data use from 5G streaming cloud computing and other digitization trends is driving the need for more mobile-communications infrastructure and data centers. According to one estimate companies must invest $1 trillion over the next five years to upgrade global data infrastructure.

That should enable American Tower to add more tenants to its existing towers and data centers develop new sites and continue to acquire locations. These drivers position the REIT to continue growing its cash flow and dividend at above-average rates over the next few years.

The megatrend infrastructure investor

Brookfield Infrastructure (BIPC -0.69%) (BIP 0.23%) is a global infrastructure investor with operations across the utility energy midstream transportation and data sectors. The company is increasingly focused on investments aligned with the digitization decarbonization and deglobalization trends.

Brookfield has built a leading data infrastructure portfolio with towers fiber optic networks and data centers. It's also capitalizing on deglobalization by helping semiconductor giant Intel onshore manufacturing capacity by financing the construction of two new plants in the U.S.

On top of that it's investing in several decarbonization initiatives. The company expects these themes to power organic growth at or above the top end of its 6% to 9% annual target range in the coming years. That should support 5% to 9% annual dividend growth.

Securing the digital transformation

Palo Alto Networks (PANW 0.61%) is a global leader in cybersecurity. Network security is becoming increasingly important as more companies digitize their businesses and hybrid work becomes the norm.

Meanwhile cyberthreats are growing more complex and costly. According to Cybersecurity Ventures global cybercrime costs will balloon to $10.5 trillion annually by 2025 up from $3 trillion in 2015. Palo Alto Network built a three-platform strategy to help clients secure their digital transformation. That's leading it to gain market share as customers consolidate their network security with the company's integrated platform and best-of-breed capabilities.

The logistics real estate leader

Prologis (PLD -0.61%) is the global leader in logistics real estate with 1 billion square feet of space across 19 countries. Demand for warehouse space has skyrocketed since the pandemic driven by the accelerated adoption of e-commerce and shifting inventory-management practices to improve supply chain resiliency.

These digitization and globalization drivers have the REIT expecting to grow its same-site net operating income at an 8% to 10% annual rate for the next few years as legacy leases expire and are repriced to higher market rates. In addition the company expects to develop additional warehouse capacity.

According to global commercial real estate company CBRE the U.S. will need an additional 330 million square feet of distribution space by 2025 to handle the expected growth of e-commerce sales alone.

The clean energy king

NextEra Energy (NEE -1.06%) is the world's largest producer of wind and solar energy and a global leader in battery storage. It's investing billions of dollars annually to grow its renewable energy capacity and build additional clean energy infrastructure.

These investments have the utility on pace to grow its adjusted earnings per share by as much as 10% per year through 2025. That should support around 10% annual growth in its dividend through 2024. Overall the company sees upward of $4 trillion in investment opportunities to fully decarbonize the U.S. economy over the next 30 years.

Positioned to prosper

Over the coming years companies will invest trillions of dollars in digitizing decarbonizing and deglobalizing their operations. That will benefit the companies focused on capitalizing on these megatrends like American Tower Brookfield Infrastructure Palo Alto Networks Prologis and NextEra Energy. Because of that investors could do very well by investing $5000 across those five stocks over the next five years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbmd0aWFuZGkuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL3Jlc2VhcmNoLXBvbGljeS9zaW5nYXBvcmUtb2ZmaWNlLXJlbnQtZ3Jvd3RoLWRvdWJsZWQtaW4tMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Singapore Office Rent Growth Doubled in 2022,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.mingtiandi.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /real-estate/research-policy/singapore-office-rent-growth-doubled-in-2022/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021223B29FC0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbmd0aWFuZGkuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL3Jlc2VhcmNoLXBvbGljeS9zaW5nYXBvcmUtb2ZmaWNlLXJlbnQtZ3Jvd3RoLWRvdWJsZWQtaW4tMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Families concerned for their loved ones and the lack of answers after apartments in a senior living center have been without power for days.

HOUSTON Texas (KTRK) -- Family members turned to ABC13 concerned for their loved ones and the lack of answers after apartments in a senior living center have been without power for days and many are trapped in their apartments unable to leave because of flooded elevators.

Inside the Tradition-Woodway near the Tanglewood area a video shows water coming from the ceilings flooded stairwells water leaking from the exterior of the building and a huge mess for residents. According to its website the luxury complex is home to 200 independent living and 92 assisted living and memory care residences.

Katherine Jones said her mother is in her 80s and her power has been going on and off since Dec. 23.

""There was no power in her apartment the common area the pipes burst and water coming out of everywhere"" Katherine Jones said. ""She said people were getting cold but they were all helping each other out yesterday one of their neighbors had a pipe burst.""

While Jones said the power is back on the elevators are still not running and many of the residents live on higher floors.

""She couldn't get down the elevators which we found out were flooded"" Jones said. ""The only way up and down is the stairs which is tricky for an 80-year-old.""

One woman who did not want to use her name out of fear from management said her parents are also in their 80s and stuck in the building.

""People on the upper floors can't get down and the caregivers can't get to them either"" she said. ""My mother n law keeps texting me for help and there is nothing I can do.""

According to records the property is relatively new and was built in 2018.

A spokesperson told us the power outage was caused by a malfunction to a CenterPoint transformer on the Dec. 23. They say HPD and the fire department said the building is safe and no residents are in danger.

They do understand the inconvenience and contractors are on-site trying to fix the issues and elevators. The spokesperson also said ""while the Christmas weekend only compounds this difficulty we have been fully staffed.""

There is a backup generator that provided power to the common areas according to management. However that did not seem to be the case for many of the individual apartments.

After ABC13 reached out an email was sent out telling residents which said they would reserve and pay for a hotel room tonight at the Omni Hotel. But that doesn't help those who are unable to get down the stairs.

""They are stuck in their units with no way out and it's Christmas they have plans"" the woman who wants to stay anonymous said.

ABC13 has reached out to CenterPoint Energy.

Andy McClure is David “Davy” McClure’s dad. Davy a former parks commissioner and beloved Ashland City Schools bus driver died at 46 in September 2020 from complications following cardiac arrest.

Davy was also a coordinator and teacher with the park district’s outdoor education program.

In July the Ashland County Parks District announced plans to raise $500000 to build the Davy McClure Outdoor Education Center. In half a year the Ashland County Parks District has managed to raise 70% of its target.

His dad said his son earned the legacy that led to an outdoor recreation center being named after him.

“The thing is to get the little kids involved because that’s where they get imprinted on the outdoors is when they’re little” McClure said. “Once they’re bigger there’s too much phone and Internet.

“So if we get the little kids they’ll remember it forever — the bigger kids sometimes they get it sometimes they don’t. There’s too many directions they’re pulled.”

He remembered a picture his son drew when he was little. It had something to do with being outside his dad remembered. He began to describe it in greater detail but a tear that fell out of his left eye stopped him.

“I’m sorry” he said sniffling and wiping away the tear. “So yeah I think it’s gonna be a good thing.”

Bob DeSanto a parks commissioner said the district hopes to wrap up fundraising in the next six months.

“We want to start it this spring if we can but that all depends on us getting the funding … it would be wonderful to have this ready for the school kids in September (2023) if possible” he said.

So far the parks district has raised around $170000 about $80000 short of reaching $250000 — an amount philanthropists Jan and Bob Archer have pledged to match.

Sponsors for the park include businesses in the area such as Charles River Laboratories banks and the Ashland County Community Foundation as well as several individual donors.

“We have one individual who’s pledged the parking” DeSanto said.

The education center will feature a pavilion with retractable walls on three sides a fireplace and a large meeting room set up with audio and visual equipment. The building will also have Wi-Fi capabilities.

The 88-acre property DeSanto said is a “beauty” because — apart from its remote nature — it displays Ashland County’s agrarian nature “as it was in the 50s.”

“It’s really a beautiful view” he said. “It’s a place that has access to about every environment that a teacher or someone would want to teach a kid about in our area.”

The property has woodlands a creek wetlands pollinator plants a handicap-accessible pond and agriculture that DeSanto hopes allows for soil conversation education.

Eventually the outdoor education center will have paved walking trails connecting each topographical attribute DeSanto said.

“And incidentally there will be a parking lot that school buses will be able to turn around in” DeSanto said.

The fund is sponsored by Invesco. It has amassed assets over $982.26 million making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.

Why Large Cap Value

Companies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.

While value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios they also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets when you consider long-term performance growth stocks are more likely to outpace value stocks in strong bull markets.

Costs

When considering an ETF's total return expense ratios are an important factor and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.

Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.39% putting it on par with most peer products in the space.

It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.44%.

Sector Exposure and Top Holdings

ETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.

This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 22.10% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Utilities round out the top three.

Looking at individual holdings Cardinal Health Inc (CAH) accounts for about 5.65% of total assets followed by Valero Energy Corp (VLO) and Chevron Corp (CVX).

The top 10 holdings account for about 49.11% of total assets under management.

Performance and Risk

RDIV seeks to match the performance of the OFI Revenue Weighted Ultra Dividend Index before fees and expenses. The S&P 900 Dividend Revenue-Weighted Index is constructed using a rules-based methodology that starts with the S&P 900 Index subject to a maximum 5% per company weighting.

The ETF has gained about 6.60% so far this year and is up roughly 8.81% in the last one year (as of 12/26/2022). In the past 52-week period it has traded between $37.70 and $46.24.

The ETF has a beta of 1.09 and standard deviation of 32.21% for the trailing three-year period making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 61 holdings it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.

America is one of the world's most industrialized regions with the largest economy in nominal terms. This also makes it one of the world's largest consumers of electricity ranking second only to China through 3.9 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2021. In terms of sources of energy consumption petroleum and natural gas account for the largest sources and renewable energy ranks in third place. Sector wise industrial transportation and electrical power use are the largest electricity consumers in the U.S. and natural gas is the most widely used production source according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Courtesy of some of the best educational institutions in the world the U.S. is also leading the charge in researching innovative mediums for generating renewable energy. Not only is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) an American firm the world's first car maker to successfully mass produce an electric vehicle but researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are investigating methods to improve electricity generation through waves and the Sun as well as new mediums to store electricity. While solar cells are common these days these materials are unable to tap the vast amounts of energy that the Sun beams down to the Earth. On this front MIT is searching for materials that are cost effective scalable reliable and efficient at the same time. To do this they are utilizing machine learning and rapid experimentation to quickly sift through materials in hopes that a new one will provide a breakthrough.

When talking about energy any discussion would be incomplete without nuclear power plants. There are two kinds of nuclear reactions fission and fusion. With the former atoms are split up to squeeze out energy from them. However the latter is vastly more powerful (and complex) since it requires squeezing the atoms together and the resulting energy is harnessed as power. Fusion is the Sun's primary energy source and all nuclear plants in the world use fission instead. In the area of fusion the U.S. federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California was able to generate more energy from a Hydrogen plasma bombarded with lasers than the electricity used in operating the lasers instead. This was a crucial breakthrough since fusion is the most efficient and cleanest source of power - even on the nuclear front as it does not generate any radioactive waste.

Story continues

Additionally America also passed one of the most important pieces of legislation for renewable energy this year in form of the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill provides roughly $370 billion in government subsidies for clean power generation. This provides the incentive for even some of the biggest American energy companies to invest in the field. Finally global crude oil prices have injected fresh rigor into renewable energy production after they jumped to a whopping $139 per barrel earlier this year in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Today we'll take a look at the largest American energy firms with the top picks being Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE).

As good life appeared to be a mirage in the Niger Delta idealistic young men who went by the militants’ label decided to make a reality show of ransom or death (or both) with the lives of those in the region perceived to be the oppressors and their collaborators.

For them agitation was the instrument of peace and war and inexplicably the means to development. However beneath the exuberant idealism was an unmistaken quest for personal power personal wealth personal prestige and personal survival.

The creeks and the mangroves developed claws and eyes and muscles which could kill and suck blood.

No one was safe

At the centre of the game was the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) and its numerous mutations. What started with the hoisting of the flag for self-determination and justice transformed into something more sinister. “Many groups were emerging and regrouping for the purpose of this protest and agitation” says Oturubo one of the region’s leaders.

He adds “the mission was getting bad as individuals started fighting for their economic survival. The agitation got into sea piracy oil bunkering hostage taking and kidnapping for ransom. In a camp three or four people can gather themselves for operations. This was helped because gun was easy to get in the Niger Delta. Every community has its own armoury as individuals also have guns.”

The genie was out of the bottle and wreaking havoc.

When Dr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan a native of Ogbia in Bayelsa State became Nigeria’s president following the death of his principal (Umaru Musa Yar’Adua) he tried to improve on the Amnesty Programme which had been initiated by President Olusegun Obasanjo and begun by Yar’Adua before his passing. He developed a personal rapport with some of the leaders especially the taciturn but larger-than life Tompolo a honcho of MEND. But that only diminished the violence. Fregene says “sixty per cent of our brothers in this Niger Delta are militant in character and they have been engaged in the different inter-ethnic crises.”

The situation was developing its own momentum and self-perpetuation. The inter and intra-ethnic crises whetted the appetite of the devil and now the situation was becoming difficult to control. In Fregene’s words: “During this period they took up arms against one another. They were well-trained on how to use guns on how to shoot. In this process of counter exchanges they knew how to fight. Then in each area there would be one person like a kingpin who is taking care of the fighters.

He becomes the “General Officer Commanding” (GOC). So as a politician or top businessman you know you must get this person to your side. You now engage these people and fund them. You pay them give them security contract and with this funding the GOC maintains these fighters. He spreads money around.”

Trouble too was not in short supply

Emegere was one of those hired by the company to troubleshoot in the treacherous terrain of the Niger Delta. In 2011 some vandals had blown up an oil pipeline somewhere in the riverine area of Ondo State. Chevron followed due process of informing the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) the state and federal governments and the affected community. Thereafter a Joint Investigation Visit (JIV) was arranged with Emegere representing Chevron to ascertain the cause of the spillage.

Some armed mobile policemen were attached to the JIV team which left Warri for Ondo State. Emegere says that members did not know that some informants including those working with the Ondo State government may have been in touch with some elements with sinister intention. He recalls: “When we got to Igbokoda Ondo State we were to leave the jetty and board the boat but those who received us said we don’t need to go with our police escorts. They said they already have armed police escorts who would accompany us there.”

Emegere did not suspect any hanky-panky. So he and his colleagues boarded the boat and soon they were off on the unmarked path off the lagoon. It was when they got to a remote location where Chevron was not operating that he had a sense of foreboding. They knew that they were literally in hot soup. Suddenly their captors who had hitherto been calm became hostile. They said before they could visit the area of the oil spillage the JIV team had to visit the area’s traditional ruler. This was not what was discussed earlier but Emegere and the others bowed when it was clear they had no choice.

Thus began a nine-day nightmare

That makeshift “house” was an elaborate hut built on stilts on the lagoon. It represents the ugly face of the Niger Delta. It has no light no potable water no modern conveniences. It is just the old-style hut which has been used for generations before the Ilaje people realised that they were rich in hydrocarbons. That unsteady house represents the permanence of problem for the people of the Niger Delta. Emegere and his colleague were marched outside into the endless mangrove. They kept them in the mangrove from about 1 pm until sunset. At about 8 pm they ferried the captives to another community.

With their prized captives the kidnappers began negotiations with Chevron which was ready to do everything permissible within its policy regarding employees’ safety and welfare to ensure that its staff were unharmed and freed. The kidnappers kept their captives in a small room with neither electricity nor any other facility for modern living. They were fed sparingly. It was a harrowing experience. Emegere became ill. “I think it was malaria so they got me Fansidar – an antimalarial medicine. On the day we were released I could barely walk. Chevron had to send a helicopter to Igbokoda to move me to Warri clinic. I was on admission for days.”

Emegere believes his kidnap was an elaborate operation planned and executed with the active involvement of a commissioner in the Ondo State government. He also came face-to-face with the logistics of kidnapping with the support staff of caterers and doctors to ensure that the high profile hostages remained alive as bargaining chips. He came to realise that his company too had a sophisticated proactive infrastructure to deal with such emergency. With the kidnap Chevron swung into action and eventually succeeded in getting the hostages released. The company knew it was now in a different kind of war. It was a new dangerous Niger Delta.

To some Niger Delta leaders kidnapping was a legitimate weapon of the struggle. Their main targets were the staff of the oil companies especially the expatriates who were seen as more valuable hostages. But once you are a staff of an IOC you were a potential victim.

Before kidnapping became a way of life in the labyrinthine Niger Delta staff of Chevron were free to interact with members of the neighboring communities. They had friends and sometimes they went out on furlough in the neigbouring villages and towns. It was a good and peaceful environment before the Warri crisis was ignited. Since then the oil companies had learnt to take pre-cautionary measures.

Rilwanu believes he was taking the right precautions. Then came 25 July 2003. It was a Friday. It was also his birthday and his daughter’s. Early that morning he had packed his bag to spend the weekend in Benin and celebrate with members of his family. As was his habit he would call John Ashima his direct boss usually by 6.45 every morning. If Ashima did not receive his call by 6.50 am he would call him as they always talked before the usual 7 am leadership meeting in Escravos.

By 6.30 am he stepped out of his house and entered his car. In a jiffy three men emerged and asked him to step out. He knew he was in trouble. When his boss called him at 6.50 am the phone rang and rang but there was no reply. He (Ashima) knew there must be trouble. When he still could not get through he contacted Rilwanu’s neighbours and they told him that what he feared had happened. By 7.30 am the entire Chevron management was aware of what had happened. The company had to work collaboratively with the state government to secure his release.

His kidnappers told Rilwanu that they had been trailing him for more than a month for he was their specific target. They even trailed him to his home in Benin but did not have the opportunity to capture him. They tried to set him up with ladies but Rilwanu was not a ladies’ man. They said he was a straightforward but stubborn man. They knew their quarry well and were joyous that they had captured such an important prisoner.

They took him to a safe house in Warri where they kept him for two days. The kidnappers did not try to hide their identity. They told him they were Ijaws representing the Egbema National Development Forum (ENDF). They wanted their community to be recognised as one of the oil-producing communities within Chevron operations. Chevron had no business in that community. They believed this kidnap would get them what they wanted. Rilwanu knew his life was in the hands of these hard men. He prayed hard.

By virtue of his job he also interfaces with the government making him quite popular.

Rilwanu’s direct supervisor was at the centre of efforts to get him freed. The company contacted Governor Ibori who then summoned the State Security Council. For them the kidnap had come too close to the centre of the state. They employed all the resources at their disposal to look for Rilwanu and that was why the kidnappers were moving him regularly.

They knew Chevron would not pay ransom and therefore they settled for the olive branch offered by the government of Ibori who promised to investigate their grievances. On the eighth day the kidnappers quietly dropped Rilwanu on a side street in Warri and told him he was free.

Many years after the memory of that ordeal still holds Rilwanu captive. He said he could not drive alone and anytime a vehicle overtook him his heart would skip a beat or two. It is as if the kidnappers could again emerge from the shadows and present him with another nightmare.

As he had promised Ibori persuaded the various ethnic groups in Delta State to accept government proposal on the sharing of benefits from the oil companies. The state government fused the ijaw kingdoms of Gbaramatu Egbema Ogulagha together as offshore stakeholders in NNPC/Chevron JV operation – in a bid to accept joint recognition as offshore community stakeholders. According to Rilwanu: “Government was able to impose a political solution by merging them. It just fused the three kingdoms together. This (was what) gave birth to the Gbaramatu Egbema and Oghulagha Coastal Community Front (GEOCCF).”

The state government’s formula brought relative peace. With the intervention of the state government it became easier to engage the communities in constant dialogue so that they would understand and appreciate the changing circumstance of the oil industry. Part of these engagements includes explanation on the declining production suffered by all oil producing companies since the emergence of community crises.

The Delta State Government tackled the primary cause of the conflict which was the sharing of political power. The government knew the tussle for the control of the Warri South-West Local Government Council was a festering sore dividing the Itsekiri and the Ijaw. After Ibori was sworn-in as governor on 29 May 1999 he moved to create a working relationship between the leadership of the two ethnic groups. His government brought them to Benin City (capital of Edo State). It was here after many days of negotiations that the Delta State Government was able to broker peace and reach an acceptable agreement on power sharing.

Seven years after that nightmare precisely on July 8 2010 Rilwanu was captured again.

Fifteen projects are being funded in 2022.

The annual event is among the fundraising activities of OSC an annual charity drive run by the Post and public broadcaster RTHK since 1988.

About 200 players took part in a five-a-side football tournament co-organised by the Hong Kong Football Club (HKFC) and Operation Santa Claus (OSC) at the Happy Valley Recreation Ground on November 27.

As football fans around the world were swept up in World Cup frenzy a group of children and adults in Hong Kong laced up their boots for a sports tournament that involved pitching in for charity.

The football tournament has been held since 1998.

“It’s one of the highlights of the Operation Santa Claus fundraising period” said Jim Gould RTHK’s head of the English programme service.

“The objective is to create a good fun experience for all the teams for everybody taking part and to allow everybody to contribute and take part in a happy healthy activity” he added.

“And it’s always enjoyable for the players the teams and for their supporters their families mums and dads” he said. “I’m very grateful to everybody who took part.”

Long involved in the tournament HKFC fielded teams and generated cash contributions for OSC in addition to taking part in the organisation of the tournament.

“We are very fortunate to be able to cooperate with SCMP and RTHK and help organise this event” Mark Grainger the club’s football section chairman said.

“With the profile of OSC – it’s been in Hong Kong for so long everybody knows about it – I think it’s a very positive message to the community especially to the club to understand that we through football were able to support OSC. And it’s nice to be part of it” he said.

“It’s just fabulous for the kids participating” Grainger added.

A total of 27 teams competed in the Junior U10 Boys Tournament Junior U12 Boys Tournament Junior U12 Girls Tournament and the Adult Tournament. HKFC was among the winners in each category.

“We played very well. It was a bit nerve-racking at the end but we’ve got the best goalkeeper” said Athena Grabowski 11 of the HKFC team that won in the U12 Girls competition.

“I think it’s really fun doing what you love and doing it for charity as well” she added.

Grabowski’s teammate Lola Miller also 11 could barely contain her excitement.

“I feel happy playing football and I get to play with my friends” she said.

In the adult tournament the Cup honours went to the teams representing Savills Property Management and financial giant UBS.

“We’ve supported this event for the last 10 years” said Ian Yip Wing-hoi Savills acting senior director who leads the company’s football team.

“Environmental social and corporate governance is part of our company culture and we are dedicated to fulfilling our CSR responsibilities. We’re very happy to support this charity event” he said.

“Staff wellness is also part of our ESG objectives. The company sponsors the football team. We actually play every week and we also trained specifically for this tournament.”

UBS also said it was deeply committed to the event.

“OSC is a big thing for UBS. Every December or late November we will have a lot of fundraising activities for OSC” said David Pun Hiu-lok the company’s executive director. “We have joined this football tournament for many years.”

He added the team was well-prepared for the match.

“We held some internal games to select the best players in UBS. Best not just in terms of skill but also for their spirit and for having a heart that wants to do something good for society” Pun said.

“We have observed a lot of world-class games at the World Cup” he said adding his team members had stayed up until 6am the night before their match to watch the global tournament.

Chubb Insurance another participant found the event worthwhile in more ways than one.

“We find it very meaningful and at the same time we can do some exercise as well. One important thing is to build the team spirit” said Charles Lui Ka-kui head of financial lines at Chubb.",,,,,,

""Theologians are like the scouting party sent by Joshua to explore the land of Canaan"" in the Book of Numbers; ""they are charged with finding the right paths toward the inculturation of the faith"" Francis wrote in a message he handed to members of the International Network of Societies for Catholic Theology May 10.

The network which includes the Catholic Theological Society of America and similar groups around the world promotes collaborative research projects by theologians from different cultures and encourages dialogue with scholars from other churches other religions and various scientific disciplines.

In his prepared text Francis told members of the group that theology is ""a significant and necessary ecclesial ministry"" because ""it is part of our Catholic faith to explain the reason for our hope to all those who ask.""

But in ""our increasingly multiethnic and mobile societies marked by the interconnectedness of different peoples languages and cultural backgrounds"" the pope wrote theology helps Catholics and the church assess the changes and reflect on values needed ""to help build a future of peace solidarity and universal brotherhood to say nothing of care for our common home.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhdGhvbGljbmV3c2FnZW5jeS5jb20vbmV3cy8yNTc2MTYvcWF0YXJzLXN0LWNoYXJiZWwtbWFyb25pdGUtY2h1cmNoLXByZXBhcmVzLXRvLXdlbGNvbWUtd29yc2hpcHBlcnPSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYXRob2xpY25ld3NhZ2VuY3kuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzI1NzYxNi9xYXRhcnMtc3QtY2hhcmJlbC1tYXJvbml0ZS1jaHVyY2gtcHJlcGFyZXMtdG8td2VsY29tZS13b3JzaGlwcGVycw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Qatar’s St. Charbel Maronite Church prepares to welcome worshippers,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhdGhvbGljbmV3c2FnZW5jeS5jb20vbmV3cy8yNTc2MTYvcWF0YXJzLXN0LWNoYXJiZWwtbWFyb25pdGUtY2h1cmNoLXByZXBhcmVzLXRvLXdlbGNvbWUtd29yc2hpcHBlcnPSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYXRob2xpY25ld3NhZ2VuY3kuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzLzI1NzYxNi9xYXRhcnMtc3QtY2hhcmJlbC1tYXJvbml0ZS1jaHVyY2gtcHJlcGFyZXMtdG8td2VsY29tZS13b3JzaGlwcGVycw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000212251E1C00>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Olive Baptist Church in Pittsview AL burns down after an overnight fire,"PITTSVIEW Ala. (WTVM) - In Pittsview Alabama a pastor is now without his church after it was burned down in an overnight fire. The church is believed to have been struck by lightning.

We went to Mount Olive Baptist Church where there was still smoke from the fire. Officials say the church was around 200 years old and some members had gone to the church for as long as 50 years.

We spoke with Reverand Eugene Brown who has been the pastor at Mount Olive for the last 8 years.

He said the group’s faith is still strong despite seeing their beloved church in ashes.

“The building is destroyed but We are still here because we are the true church of God not the building and we can worship anywhere” said Brown.

No injuries were reported at the church on Continuation Street in Pittsview - there have also been no announcements for rebuilding.

Taking place on May 2 Orthodox Holy Thursday the ordination was conducted at St. Nektarios Mission Parish near Harare Zimbabwe by the archbishop of Zimbabwe Metropolitan Serafim.

The St. Phoebe Center for the Deaconess a U.S.-based organization that has advocated for reviving the ancient female diaconate said in a press release that Molen’s ordination would prepare the way for the restoration of the role in other branches of the Orthodox Church. The group’s board chair Dr. Carrie Frost wrote: “Being the first to do anything is always a challenge but the Patriarchate of Alexandria has courageously chosen to lead the way with Metropolitan Serafim laying his hands on Deaconess Angelic.”

According to the release Molen said: “At first I was nervous about going into the altar but when Metropolitan Serafim blessed me to enter the altar as part of my preparation this week those feelings went away and I felt comfortable. I am ready.” According to the St. Phoebe Center Molen was well received by her community and parish.

“The Alexandrian Patriarchate in Africa felt the need to revive this order to serve the daily pastoral needs of Orthodox Christians in Africa” the release read. Metropolitan Serafim said that Molen will have both liturgical and pastoral roles. He said: “She is going to do what the deacon is doing in the liturgy and in all the sacraments in our Orthodox services.”

Serafim added that “one of the most important fields of work of the deaconess was the exercise of the works of love. They were the angels of mercy and the visiting sisters of the sick the ‘grieving’ and poor women imparting to them the gifts of Christian love.”

One of the important functions of deaconesses will be to distribute the Eucharist even while their role will not be identical to the work of their counterparts of more than 1000 years ago. However he noted that “we must admit that women can offer the Orthodox Church a great missionary work” as well as evangelism and teaching and highlighted their missionary catechetical and teaching work. After her ordination Molen distributed the holy Eucharist which in the Byzantine rite is given via spoon and includes the body and the blood.

The Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa has been on the way to diaconal ordination of women for several years. At a 2016 synod in Alexandria Egypt the Patriarchate voted to reinstate the female diaconate. In 2017 the Patriarchate ordained six sub-deaconesses in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Among the functions of deaconesses may be baptism which in Orthodox churches is conducted by full immersion. In the early Church full immersion for adults was followed by anointing of the whole body which required the assistance of deaconesses for the sake of propriety.

According to the 1917 Catholic Encyclopedia the only mention of a deaconess in the Bible is in St. Paul’s Letter to the Romans (16:1) which refers to Phoebe as diakonos or “servant” even while no official status was implied. However citing testimony by Roman author Pliny the encyclopedia says “there can be no question that before the middle of the fourth century women were permitted to exercise certain definite functions in the Church and were known by the special name of diakonoi or diakonissai.” The fourth-century apostolic constitutions include instructions for the ordination to the female diaconate.

Despite the ancient practice Pope Francis has declared it is impossible for women to be ordained to the priesthood or diaconate.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndyYmwuY29tL25ld3MvcnVzc2VsbC1jb3VudHktY2h1cmNoLWRlc3Ryb3llZC1pbi1maXJlLWZyb20tc3VzcGVjdGVkLWxpZ2h0bmluZy1zdHJpa2Uv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3JibC5jb20vbmV3cy9ydXNzZWxsLWNvdW50eS1jaHVyY2gtZGVzdHJveWVkLWluLWZpcmUtZnJvbS1zdXNwZWN0ZWQtbGlnaHRuaW5nLXN0cmlrZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Russell County church destroyed in fire from suspected lightning strike,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wrbl.com/news/russell-county-church-destroyed-in-fire-from-suspected-lightning-strike/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndyYmwuY29tL25ld3MvcnVzc2VsbC1jb3VudHktY2h1cmNoLWRlc3Ryb3llZC1pbi1maXJlLWZyb20tc3VzcGVjdGVkLWxpZ2h0bmluZy1zdHJpa2Uv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3JibC5jb20vbmV3cy9ydXNzZWxsLWNvdW50eS1jaHVyY2gtZGVzdHJveWVkLWluLWZpcmUtZnJvbS1zdXNwZWN0ZWQtbGlnaHRuaW5nLXN0cmlrZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

A recent report by the union SEIU 32BJ finds that New York City private hospitals charge three to four times Medicare rates for the same care and routinely bill multiples more than their big city counterparts. The city’s outrageous hospital prices cause financial devastation suppressed wages municipal budget shortfalls and worse health outcomes as people avoid care.

City Councilwoman Julie Menin introduced legislation on Dec. 7 to empower New Yorkers to substantially reduce their healthcare costs. Her proposed Office of Healthcare Accountability will aggregate actual city hospital prices on a website allowing consumers including unions employers and the municipal government to compare and save. It can hold city hospitals accountable for their rampant overcharging. The bill has since been sponsored by 40 Council members meaning it is supported by a supermajority of the City Council.

Real price information is essential in healthcare given the well-documented wide price variations for the same care even at the same hospital. The price of a standard brain MRI at Mount Sinai varies from $219 to $3600 depending on the insurer. At NYU Langone Tisch the price of this basic treatment is $838 if covered by an Aetna HMO versus $2744 if covered by a UnitedHealthcare HMO.

NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital has 40 prices for an epidural injection. Those covered by Aetna Cigna or Blue Cross commercial plans pay more than $7300 while those with UnitedHealthcare pay $3100.

When consumers can access actual prices upfront they can avoid price gouging hospitals in favor of less expensive alternatives. Armed with real prices no one will tolerate paying ten times more than the person in the bed next to them for the same care. Prices will fall to fair market rates.

New York City Council Members Julie Menin and Lynn Schulman speak on the steps of City Hall supported by Coalition for Affordable Hospitals NYC Labor Unions and Power to the Patients with Susan Sarandon on their proposed legislation to pass the Healthcare Accountability and Consumer Protection Act on Wednesday Dec. 07 2022 in New York. (Andrew Kelly/AP Images for Power to the Patients)

Americans already have the right to know hospital prices before care due to a federal price transparency rule that took effect on Jan. 1 2021 requiring hospitals to post their discounted cash and negotiated insurance rates.

Unfortunately the rule has been marred by widespread hospital non-compliance. According to a recent study by PatientRightsAdvocate.org only 16% of hospitals nationwide — and only two out of 14 examined in New York City — are fully following it.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has only fined two hospitals for non-compliance out of the thousands nationwide not obeying the rule. This lack of robust enforcement allows hospitals to continue blinding patients to prices so they can blindside them with bills they otherwise never would have agreed to. As a result many hospitals are so profitable they have their own private equity arms venture capital funds and offshore bank accounts. According to a Kaiser Health News analysis American “non-profit” hospitals together hold more than $283 billion in invested financial assets.

The proposed Office of Healthcare Accountability will encourage more New York City hospitals to post their actual prices by 1) assessing hospital compliance with the price transparency rule — i.e. naming and shaming bad actors; and 2) drawing on available price disclosures to make recommendations to city officials about how to reduce healthcare costs. Hospitals that want to best compete for the significant business of municipal employees will have to be price transparent.

Municipal hospital savings are needed now. According to a recent report by state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli the city faces a $10 billion budget shortfall. SEIU 32BJ which covers approximately 200000 building services workers and their families across the Northeast estimates the city can save $2 billion by steering city workers to public hospitals.

SEIU 32BJ has enjoyed dramatic healthcare savings of its own. It recently dropped NewYork-Presbyterian hospital from its health plan for overcharging its members. For instance the hospital billed it an average of $10368 for outpatient colonoscopies versus $2185 at the city’s public hospitals. The union saved roughly $30 million as a result of this move. It used these funds to give its members their largest pay increases in history and $3000 bonuses.

The Office of Healthcare Accountability will make it easier for unions employers and patients to follow 32BJ’s lead and identify substantial savings.

To coincide with this bill’s introduction the Coalition for Affordable Hospitals which includes unions patient advocacy groups and community organizations rallied in front of City Hall. Demonstrators demanded City Council rein in price-gouging hospitals that continue to profiteer off price opacity. Passing this measure is a good place for legislators to start.

Robust price transparency can reverse New York’s runaway hospital prices through choice and competition and empower residents to access the care they need at prices they can afford. It can cut New York City hospital prices down to size.

Financial challenges prompted district officials to consider consolidating Anderson and Turpin high schools – an idea now on hold as officials weigh putting a levy on the May ballot.

But an unrelated big-money suit filed against Forest Hills five years ago over a $23 million construction project at Anderson High School is heating up.

And it’s likely off many people’s radars despite the impact it could have on the school district’s budget and how special meetings are conducted.

Here are five things to know about the lawsuit:

What's new in the case?

A Hamilton County Common Pleas Court judge has scheduled a jury trial in July 2023 for the suit brought by Performance Construction of North Bend the general contractor of the work at Anderson High.

What's the beef?

Performance sued the Forest Hills Board of Education and others in 2019 after the school district fired it from a renovation and expansion job at Anderson High School.

Forest Hills said it let Performance go because the district was unhappy with the quality and pace of the company’s work.

Performance said Forest Hills fired it to conceal the fact that the district was responsible for delays and overspending.

Performance also said Forest Hills did not want to pay the company what it was owed and that the district fired Performance after a series of school board meetings that violated Ohio’s Open Meetings Act.

All parties to the suit deny wrongdoing.

What's at stake?

To put it plainly: millions of dollars. Performance originally asked for $8 million in its lawsuit. It sought an additional unspecified amount of money when it filed an amended suit in 2020 with the Open Meetings allegations.

A year later presiding Judge Tom Heekin narrowed the number of allegations Forest Hills will face at trial to breach of contract and violations of the Open Meetings Act.

Heekin tossed out other accusations in the lawsuit such as and unjust enrichment potentially lessening Forest Hills’ financial liability should it lose the suit.

Still in play is a breach-of-contract claim Forest Hills filed against Performance after the company sued the school board – even though the school district ultimately rehired Performance to finish the work at Anderson High.

The claim will be part of next year’s trial.

Related suit settled

Forest Hills and its insurance company agreed in November 2021 to pay about $2.2 million to settle a lawsuit filed by a subcontractor that cleared and prepared the construction site at Anderson High School.

J&D Rack Co. of Green Township had sued Forest Hills Performance and others in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court in 2018.

Forest Hills agreed to pay Rack $1.28 million.

The school district also agreed to pay Performance $969678 so Performance could pay what it owed its subcontractors material suppliers and laborers for their work on the project.

That included $39557 owed Rack.

Forest Hills’ payment to Performance in the Rack case did not absolve the district of the claims it faces in the 2019 lawsuit filed by Performance and set for trial next year.

Another related suit settled

In July 2020 Hamilton County Judge Robert Ruehlman put a lawsuit filed in common pleas court by another subcontractor on the Anderson High project on hold because the case was in arbitration.

B&J Electrical Co. of Golf Manor sued Forest Hills Performance and an insurance company earlier that year for $117500 in unpaid work.

In September B&J Electrical filed a notice of dismissal in court saying the matter has been settled.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZm94YW5kd2Vla3MuY29tL29iaXR1YXJpZXMvby85NDI4L1JvYmVydC0oQm9iKS1Mb3Vpcy1MZXN0aW5h0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Robert (Bob) Louis Lestina - Savannah,"Robert (Bob) Louis Lestina Jr. an 18-year resident of Savannah GA passed away on December 26 2022 after a courageous and lengthy battle with pancreatic cancer.

Bagaimana tidak? Anda dapat merasa disayangi didambakan dan diperhatikan dari waktu ke waktu secara konsisten.

Usai hari yang melelahkan Anda pun tahu ada yang menunggu kehadiran Anda untuk sekadar bertukar cerita dan keluh kesah tentang apa yang terjadi begitu juga sebaliknya.

Namun ternyata cinta saja tak pernah cukup untuk membuat hubungan dapat berjalan dengan baik hingga bertahun-tahun kedepan. Lalu apalagi yang dibutuhkan?

""Cinta itu perasaan yang hebat. Tapi itu saja tidak cukup untuk membuat siapapun bisa berkomitmen denganmu"" ujar terapis perkawinan dan keluarga Kiaundra Jackson mengutip Elite Daily Senin (26/12/2022).

Tak peduli seberapa kuat perasaan cinta Anda pada pasangan tetap ada kenyataan hidup yang harus dihadapi hari demi hari. Anda dan pasangan akan dihadapkan dengan berbagai persoalan dan membutuhkan landasan yang sangat kokoh untuk berpijak.

""Jadi jika Anda tidak memiliki unsur-unsur lain seperti saling menghargai saling jujur percaya tanggung jawab saling mendukung dan mau berkomitmen maka jatuh cinta saja tidak akan mempertahankan apapun dalam jangka panjang"" kata Jackson.

Apalagi menurut Jackson banyak film maupun tontonan di media yang hanya menekankan pada perasaan cinta. Namun tidak membahas secara gamblang soal ikatan pada awal hubungan yang harus dilengkapi dengan berbagai aspek.

""Saya pikir itu secara tidak sadar telah mengubah cara kita memandang hubungan percintaan yang sebenarnya"" kata Jackson.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8va3VtcGFyYW4uY29tL2luc3BpcmFzaS1rYXRhLzIwLWthdGEta2F0YS1wZW5na2hpYW5hdGFuLWNpbnRhLXlhbmctbWVueWFraXRrYW4tMXpWOGNhRXVCU2_SAWdodHRwczovL20ua3VtcGFyYW4uY29tL2FtcC9pbnNwaXJhc2kta2F0YS8yMC1rYXRhLWthdGEtcGVuZ2toaWFuYXRhbi1jaW50YS15YW5nLW1lbnlha2l0a2FuLTF6VjhjYUV1QlNv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,20 Kata-kata Pengkhianatan Cinta yang Menyakitkan - kumparan.com,Suatu pengkhianatan bisa merusak kepercayaan termasuk dalam urusan.

WOOD COUNTY Texas — Officials say they believe two escaped inmates from Mississippi who left a stolen van in a Wood County lake Sunday were spotted between Dallas and Abilene.

According to the Hinds County Sheriff's Office in Mississippi inmates Traverro McElroy 36 and Tyler Charles Payne 31 escaped from the Raymond Detention Center in Jackson Mississippi around 7:30 p.m. Christmas Eve (Saturday).

The sheriff's office in Mississippi performed a headcount of the inmates around 11 a.m. Christmas Day to find that McElroy who is jailed for possession of a firearm and murder and Payne who is charged with carjacking had escaped.

Officials said the inmates took a van that belonged to Belmont Church which was burglarized Sunday overnight in Mississippi. The van was found in Lake Fork in Wood County around noon Christmas Day Hinds County Sheriff Tyree Jones said.

A statement from the Wood County Sheriff’s Office said the van was seen driving into Lake Fork. Divers from the Quitman Fire Department located and recovered the vehicle.

In an update Wednesday the WSCO said on Facebook that Cisco Police Department officers tried to make contact with a silver Toyota Camry on Tuesday which had a white man and Black man inside. The vehicle evaded officers and headed westbound on Interstate 20 from Cisco.

The Cisco Police Department chief said the driver matched the description of one of the Mississippi inmates but officers didn't get a good enough look at the Black occupant to get an identification the sheriff's office said.

""At this time the inmates have yet to be captured however they are believed to be continuing west"" the sheriff's office Facebook post read.

Jones said the inmates escaped through the recreation center door and jumped several fences. The staff failed to complete a headcount Saturday evening.

Witnesses on Sunday saw two men near the van and they reportedly left in a white or silver older model Toyota or Honda compact vehicle.

The sheriff's office said it's unknown where the other vehicle is from. Neither of the inmates have ties to Wood County but they do have connections to the Dallas/Fort Worth area.



Payne has multiple tattoos including a tattoo on his neck. He is 5’11"" and 195 pounds with green eyes and a shaved head. McElroy is 5’5"" and 120 pounds and he has a dread hairstyle.



Both are considered dangerous and people are encouraged to call 911 if they see them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vY2lvLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9jb3Jwb3JhdGUtbmV3cy9pbnRlbC1jb25uZWN0aW9uLWRpZ2l0YWwtdHJhbnNmb3JtYXRpb24tdW5sZWFzaGVkLzk2NTE1OTY30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel ConnectiON: Digital Transformation Unleashed,"Advt

The Straits Times

Dec 23 2022

An enforcement officer who was authorised to apprehend offenders for having illegal tobacco-related products ended up pocketing more than $1000 worth of those that were voluntarily disposed of by incoming travellers at the airport.

Mohan Raj Akilan 31 was sentenced to three months’ jail and fined $800 on Friday after he pleaded guilty to one charge of receiving stolen property and another charge of possessing an imitation tobacco product.

Another charge was taken into consideration during the Malaysian’s sentencing.

Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Hsiao Tien said Mohan was employed by Certis Cisco Auxiliary Police Force as an enforcement officer between April 19 2011 and Aug 8 2022.

He was deployed around May 2021 to the enforcement operation unit under the Tobacco Regulation Branch (TRB) of the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) which outsourced tobacco enforcement works to Certis.

One of the duties of officers in that branch is to collect prohibited tobacco-related products that were voluntarily disposed of by travellers entering Singapore via Changi Airport.

They can dispose of these products without any repercussions by filling up a voluntary disposal receipt and an immigration officer will discard the item in a bin which is locked.

Every week or whenever the bins are full or nearly full HSA will issue ad hoc requests to Certis to collect the items that will eventually be destroyed at an incineration plant in Tuas.

Some time in 2021 and 2022 DPP Tan said several TRB officers tasked to perform the collection began misappropriating contraband cigarettes e-vaporisers and e-vaporiser pod products after they realised there was an opportunity for them to do so.

They realised that no other staff member would be around when they transferred the discarded items into empty black bins.

They also realised there was no record of the amount description or weight of the items collected and no procedure to ensure that the items collected tallied with the items declared in the disposal receipts.

So the officers pocketed a portion of the contraband items when transferring the contents into the black bins and packed them in a separate plastic bag.

After the remaining products were packed into the black bins they kept the separate plastic bag in the Certis van parked at the carpark.

The misappropriated items would then be shared among the team of TRB officers on collection duty at the airport.

On some occasions they would also share the misappropriated items with other TRB officers including Mohan.

DPP Tan said: “Gradually the sharing of misappropriated items among the Certis TRB officers became an ‘open secret’ or ‘unspoken rule’ among them.”

Some time between June and July 2021 Mohan received $1417 worth of tobacco-related products including 40 packs of e-vaporiser pods and seven e-vaporisers from a fellow enforcement officer.

For receiving stolen property he could have been jailed for up to five years fined or both.

Meanwhile another officer from the same unit was jailed on Friday for three weeks for forging forms documenting illegal tobacco products he had confiscated from trainee officers.

Mohamad Nor Amali Halmi a 35-year-old Malaysian who was employed by People Advantage a member of the Certis Group got the trainee officers to sign on the initial documents he sent to his team supervisor.

But when his supervisor could not locate the documents Amali forged a new set of documents after he could not get the trainees to sign them again.",,,

Rep.-elect George Santos told The New York Post he fabricated key details about his credentials.

The report confirmed an earlier investigation by The New York Times claiming Santos misled voters.

Santos lied about working for Goldman Sachs and Citigroup and graduating from Baruch College.

New York Rep.-elect George Santos told The New York Post on Monday that he lied about his education and work experience confirming an earlier New York Times investigation that found he likely misrepresented his background to voters.

The Republican congressman-elect elected in November to represent parts of Long Island and Queens told The Post that his fabrications wouldn't stop him from assuming office.

""I am not a criminal"" Santos told The Post.

Santos admitted to The Post that he fabricated several details regarding his professional and educational background including claims that he worked for Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. He said Monday that he ""never worked directly"" for either of the major Wall Street banks calling claims that he worked there ""a poor choice of words.""

Santos told The Post that he actually worked for Link Bridge a company he said did business with both firms.

He also admitted that he never graduated from college. Santos had previously claimed to be a 2010 graduate of Baruch College. The New York Times investigation revealed that Baruch College had no record of Santos as a student.

Santos also addressed a report from the Jewish news outlet The Forward that appeared to show he lied about his family background on his campaign website which said that his mother was Jewish and his grandparents had escaped the Nazis during the Holocaust.

""I never claimed to be Jewish"" Santos told The Post saying that his grandmother ""told stories about being Jewish"" before converting to Catholicism. ""I am Catholic. Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background I said I was 'Jew-ish.'""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMjYvbnlyZWdpb24vZ2VvcmdlLXNhbnRvcy1pbnRlcnZpZXcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,George Santos Admits to Lying About College and Work History (Published 2022),"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.nytimes.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2022/12/26/nyregion/george-santos-interview.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000212272F2E30>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMjYvbnlyZWdpb24vZ2VvcmdlLXNhbnRvcy1pbnRlcnZpZXcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMTIvMjYvZ2VvcmdlLXNhbnRvcy1iYWNrZ3JvdW5kLW55LXBvc3QtMDAwNzU2MDXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rep.-elect Santos admits lying about his credentials,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.politico.com/news/2022/12/26/george-santos-background-ny-post-00075605 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMTIvMjYvZ2VvcmdlLXNhbnRvcy1iYWNrZ3JvdW5kLW55LXBvc3QtMDAwNzU2MDXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzI2L3JlcC1lbGVjdC1nZW9yZ2Utc2FudG9zLWFkbWl0cy1mYWJyaWNhdGluZy1rZXktZGV0YWlscy1vZi1oaXMtYmlvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Liar Rep.-elect George Santos admits fabricating key details of his bio,"Long Island Rep.-elect George Santos came clean to The Post on Monday admitting that he lied on the campaign trail about his education and work experience — but insisting that the controversy won’t deter him from serving out his two-year term in Congress.

“I am not a criminal” Santos said at one point during his exclusive interview. “This [controversy] will not deter me from having good legislative success. I will be effective. I will be good.”

Santos’ professional biography was called into question earlier this month after the New York Times reported that he misrepresented a number of claims including where he attended college and his alleged employment history with high-profile Wall Street firms.

“My sins here are embellishing my resume. I’m sorry” Santos said Monday.

Santos confessed he had “never worked directly” for Goldman Sachs and Citigroup chalking that fib up to a “poor choice of words.”

The 34-year-old now claims instead that a company called Link Bridge where he worked as a vice president did business with both of the financial giants.

“I will be clearer about that. It was stated poorly” Santos said of the lie.

At Link Bridge Santos said he helped make “capital introductions” between clients and investors and Goldman Sachs and Citigroup were “LPS Limited Partnerships” that his company dealt with.

He also admitted that he never graduated from any college despite previously claiming to have received a degree from Baruch in 2010.

“I didn’t graduate from any institution of higher learning. I’m embarrassed and sorry for having embellished my resume” he said. “I own up to that … We do stupid things in life.”

Santos elected to Congress on Nov. 8 to represent the Long Island- and Queens-based 3rd District was also accused of lying about his family history saying on his campaign website that his mother was Jewish and his grandparents escaped the Nazis during World War II.

Santos now says that he’s “clearly Catholic” but claimed his grandmother told stories about being Jewish and later converting to Catholicism.

“I never claimed to be Jewish” Santos said. “I am Catholic. Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background I said I was ‘Jew-ish.'”

Santos the first openly gay non-incumbent Republican elected to the House also faced accusations that he lied about his sexual orientation with the Daily Beast reporting last week that he was previously married to a woman until shortly before he launched his unsuccessful 2020 campaign against Democrat Tom Suozzi.

The soon-to-be lawmaker confirmed to The Post on Monday that he was indeed married to a woman for about five years from 2012 until his divorce in 2017 but insisted that he is now a happily married gay man.

“I dated women in the past. I married a woman. It’s personal stuff” Santos said adding that the relationship “got a little toxic.”

“I’m very much gay” he says now. “I’m OK with my sexuality. People change. I’m one of those people who change.”

Santos also acknowledged being a deadbeat tenant in Sunnyside Queens where the Times reported he was ordered by a judge to pay more than $12000 to a former landlord who claimed non-payment of several months of rent — as well as that Santos had tried to pass a check that bounced.

On Monday Santos claimed that at the time of the lawsuit his family was deep in medical debt from his mother’s cancer battle.

“We were engulfed in debt” he said. “We had issues paying rent at the time. It’s the vulnerability of being human. I am not embarrassed by it.”

Santos said his mother died of cancer on Dec. 23 2016 after living with him at the Queens apartment and acknowledged the judgment against him.

Asked if he ever actually paid the arrears Santos admitted: “We didn’t pay it off. I completely forgot about it.”

Santos also admitted to lying when he claimed that he owned 13 different properties saying he now resides at his sister’s place in Huntington but is looking to purchase his own place.

“George Santos does not own any properties” he said.

Santos was defiant on one point — denying an allegation raised by the Times that he had an unspecified criminal charge filed against him in Brazil.

“I am not a criminal here — not here or in Brazil or any jurisdiction in the world” Santos said. “Absolutely not. That didn’t happen.”

The incoming congressman dismissed concerns that his lies will impact his effectiveness in representing New Yorkers in the lower chamber in the new year.

“I campaigned talking about the people’s concerns not my resume” Santos told The Post.

“I intend to deliver on the promises I made during the campaign — fighting crime fighting to lower inflation improving education” he added saying that “The people elected me to fight for them.”

“I came to DC to bring results on those issues and that’s what I’m going to do.”

Meanwhile Santos said the $11 million in assets reported in his financial disclosure report filed in September are tied to his Devolder consulting firm.

“All of my finances come from the firm. The assets are the contracts with the firm” he told The Post.

His campaign committee Devolder-Santos for Congress also reported that he personally loaned his campaign more than $600000.

Senior House Republicans were apparently aware of the inaccuracies and embellishments in the member-elect’s resume and the topic became a “running joke” multiple insiders close to House GOP leadership told The Post over the weekend.

“As far as questions about George in general that was always something that was brought up whenever we talked about this race” said one senior GOP leadership aide. “It was a running joke at a certain point. This is the second time he’s run and these issues we assumed would be worked out by the voters.”

Last week the top Republican in Nassau County demanded that Santos explain himself after his web of lies began to unravel.

“While I have indicated that the congressman-elect deserves a reasonable amount of time to respond to the media voters deserve a sincere accounting from Mr. Santos” said Nassau County Republican Committee Chairman Joseph Cairo. “I will be listening attentively and I want to hear meaningful remarks from George Santos.”

That same day Santos broke his three-day silence since reports of his prevarications emerged tweeting: “To the people of #NY03 I have my story to tell and it will be told next week. I want to assure everyone that I will address your questions and that I remain committed to deliver the results I campaigned on; Public Safety Inflation Education & more.”

He then added: “Happy Holidays to all!”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvaG91c2UvMzc4ODk5My1uZXcteW9yay1yZXAtZWxlY3QtZ2VvcmdlLXNhbnRvcy1hZG1pdHMtZmFicmljYXRpbmctY29sbGVnZS13b3JrLWV4cGVyaWVuY2UtZGV0YWlscy_SAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9ob3VzZS8zNzg4OTkzLW5ldy15b3JrLXJlcC1lbGVjdC1nZW9yZ2Utc2FudG9zLWFkbWl0cy1mYWJyaWNhdGluZy1jb2xsZWdlLXdvcmstZXhwZXJpZW5jZS1kZXRhaWxzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New York Rep.-elect George Santos admits fabricating college work details,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3788993-new-york-rep-elect-george-santos-admits-fabricating-college-work-experience-details/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvaG91c2UvMzc4ODk5My1uZXcteW9yay1yZXAtZWxlY3QtZ2VvcmdlLXNhbnRvcy1hZG1pdHMtZmFicmljYXRpbmctY29sbGVnZS13b3JrLWV4cGVyaWVuY2UtZGV0YWlscy_SAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9ob3VzZS8zNzg4OTkzLW5ldy15b3JrLXJlcC1lbGVjdC1nZW9yZ2Utc2FudG9zLWFkbWl0cy1mYWJyaWNhdGluZy1jb2xsZWdlLXdvcmstZXhwZXJpZW5jZS1kZXRhaWxzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

It strained their budgets reduced their spending power and clobbered their 401(k) balances. Despite a recent burst of positive news—moderating gas prices and a slowing pace of inflation—many believe the economy will be in worse shape in 2023 than it is now.

Whatever the next 12 months bring there are some simple steps you can take now to prepare your finances for any further economic uncertainty.

Move cash to banking accounts that yield more in interest and charge less in fees. Cancel unused memberships and negotiate charges on those you keep. Review 401(k) contributions and allocations.

It might pay to act with urgency. Some financial benefits that could make a difference expire on New Year’s Eve. Here are six money moves to consider making before breaking out the bubbly:

Earn more on your savings

Keeping your cash in a typical savings account right now is only marginally better than stuffing it under a mattress. The average annual interest rate on savings accounts at all banks is 0.268% according to the financial site DepositAccounts.com meaning $1000 in savings will yield barely enough to buy a slice of pizza.

Some of the lowest rates are at the biggest institutions. Customers of the five largest U.S. banks could have earned $42 billion more on their balances in the third quarter just by moving their cash to higher yielding accounts at other banks by one estimate. Some online-only accounts for example pay rates around 4% and can be linked to an existing account for easy transfers.

The payoff involved in moving your cash away from the biggest banks is currently greater than at any point in the last decade according to Ken Tumin the founder of DepositAccounts which is owned by the financial-services marketplace LendingTree.

True optimizers might appreciate MaxMyInterest a service that in exchange for a 0.08% annual fee on their holdings monitors which banks offer the highest interest rates and allows customers to reallocate their cash accordingly on a regular basis.

For those willing to sacrifice some liquidity one of the best risk-free returns right now comes from inflation-adjusted I Bonds which currently pay out 6.89% but must be held for at least a year. Americans can buy up to $10000 of these U.S. government-backed savings bonds each calendar year so those who want to max out their purchases should do so before January says Mr. Tumin. The interest rate on these bonds is based on a calculation tied to the consumer-price index one reason they became popular this year as inflation surged.

After I Bonds Mr. Tumin suggests considering certificates of deposit or Treasury securities some of which offer higher rates than those of the top online savings accounts; for instance a six-month T-bill purchased Thursday would yield about 4.66% on an annualized basis. That said temporarily tying up your money could mean missing out on better yields soon if the Federal Reserve continues to raise rates.

Finding a home for your cash that pays higher yields won’t make you rich but it can give you some protection from inflation says Gary Zimmerman the CEO of MaxMyInterest. Even some of the best options have still been outpaced by inflation recently. “The real return on cash may be negative but it would be even more negative if you’re complacent about where you keep your cash"" he says.

Switch your bank accounts

Banking changed dramatically over the last two decades but chances are the institution you bank with hasn’t. Americans stick with the same primary checking and savings accounts for about 17 years on average according to a Bankrate survey. That is longer than the average marriage.

It is worth regularly shopping around to make sure you’re still getting the best deal says Greg McBride chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com particularly if you are paying any ATM or monthly maintenance fees. It is now easy to find a bank that offers those services free he said and the benefits could outweigh the inconvenience of switching institutions.

For example customers who typically carry a low balance in their checking account may benefit from choosing accounts with an extended overdraft grace period. One institution Citizens Financial Group added a feature to some of its checking accounts that gives customers who overdraft until 10 p.m. the following business day to cover the negative balance to avoid fees.

A customer who has more than $250000 which is the maximum amount per depositor that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. may also benefit from switching to a brokerage that can offer more insurance coverage by partnering with multiple FDIC-regulated banks. One brokerage giant Fidelity Investments allows customers to hold up to $3 million in insured deposits in its cash management account through partnerships with 26 banks.

Many new financial-technology companies offer even more specialized features bundled with checking accounts. LiliApp Inc. an online-only bank for gig-economy workers and entrepreneurs includes a tax-write-off tracker with its checking account. Majority a digital bank for migrants offers unlimited international transfers as part of its monthly subscription fee.

Cancel your subscriptions

This time of year many Americans sign up for gym memberships as part of a resolution to lose a few pounds. It is also a good time to cancel unused memberships to shed a few bucks from your budget.

The average American spends more than $200 a month on subscription fees and underestimates the cost by roughly $130 according to a study by C+R Research earlier this year. Roughly three quarters of consumers say it is easy to forget about recurring charges and 42% admitted that they were still paying for a subscription they had forgotten about.

The monthly costs associated with streaming services subscription boxes gym memberships and mobile apps have all crept higher over the past year according to data from Rocket Money which operates a personal finance app that tracks spending. Subscription spending among Rocket Money members increased an average of 8.5% this year compared with 2021. Once you authorize a company to take recurring payments from your account they can change the price without asking permission making it easy to lose track of exactly how much you are spending.

This is a good moment to take stock in the recurring payments you may have forgotten said Yahya Mokhtarzad chief revenue officer at Rocket Money. “This year more than recent years it is important to not just take stock of your finances but to really cut unneeded expenses and brace for what could be a tough 2023"" he said.

Renegotiate your bills

For all the recurring bills you cannot cancel pick up the phone and negotiate.

Cable companies and wireless providers may be willing to lower your bill since it costs more to acquire a new customer than to keep an existing one said Ted Rossman a consumer-spending analyst at Bankrate.

Don’t be afraid to ask the company for your old rate back or to match a competitor’s price he said. There is often an unadvertised retention discount to keep customers from canceling. You can also request any deals and discounts being offered to new customers even if you’re a longtime subscriber he said.

If you’re asking for a lower rate with a service provider such as your wireless company be aware that you may be offered a promotional rate that increases significantly after an initial period expires said Sophie Raseman head of financial solutions at Brightside a company that provides financial guidance to workers. Set a reminder to cancel or downgrade then she said.

Another way to cut costs is to ask that certain fees be removed from your statement. These charges include line items on your phone internet or cable bill and may appear as “other fees.""

If your first attempt to negotiate isn’t successful call again on a different day as you may have more success with a different customer-service representative said Bruce McClary senior vice president at National Foundation for Credit Counseling.

Check your 401(k)

The standard advice for retirement plans is to let them run on autopilot and to resist the temptation to check your account and make changes when markets are down.

But at least once a year it pays to log into your accounts and review your savings rate investment mix and the types of tax-advantaged accounts you use. The S&P 500 stock index is down 19.3% this year through Friday and U.S. intermediate-term bond funds are down 12.4%; investors should rebalance if their asset allocation has strayed from their long-term targets.

The Internal Revenue Service recently raised the annual 401(k) contribution limit $2000 to $22500 for 2023 the largest increase ever in terms of dollars and percentage according to benefits provider Milliman. For those 50 or older the 2023 limit rises to $30000.

“You should avoid checking too often based on what the market did that day but you need to check in periodically to make sure your choices are still aligned with your long-term retirement goals"" said Mike Shamrell a vice president at Fidelity Investments.

As inflation strains budgets some Americans have had to make temporary reductions in 401(k) savings. The good news: The impact of doing so—even for a few years—isn’t as big as you might think provided you have a plan to catch up later.

For those able to save more the higher contribution limits create an “unprecedented opportunity"" said Ed Slott a certified public accountant and IRA specialist in Rockville Centre N.Y.

More investors with money in workplace retirement plans now have the option of choosing between a traditional 401(k) where contributions are deducted and withdrawals are taxed and a Roth 401(k) where contributions are taxed and distributions can be tax-free. Workers can also divide their 401(k) contributions between the two.

Using some of each could pay off down the road. One advantage to putting some money into a Roth is that retirees can pull money out tax-free in years when dipping into a regular 401(k) would push them into a higher bracket.

Don’t wait until it is too late

It doesn’t pay to procrastinate. A number of important financial benefits that could improve the position of your household in 2023 expire on New Year’s Eve.

Make your financial gifts: Families can give gifts of up to $16000 to an unlimited number of people without triggering estate or gift tax. That amount known as the annual exclusion jumps to $17000 for 2023.

A special rule lets donors use five years worth of annual exclusion gifts at once to superfund 529 college savings plans which let parents grandparents and others invest money to be used for a beneficiary’s qualified education expenses. That works out to $80000 per beneficiary account for 2022.

“Paying for education is a really efficient way to transfer wealth"" says Elisa Shevlin Rizzo a chief fiduciary officer for Northern Trust Wealth Management in New York.

A separate rule lets individuals pay anyone’s qualified education expenses and medical bills without estate or gift tax consequences if they make payments directly to the school or medical provider.

Donors who give away more than $16000 to anyone must report the gifts on a federal gift tax return Form 709. Any excess amount counts toward the amount you can give during your lifetime or at death and be exempt from federal estate and gift taxes. That exemption is $12.06 million per person for 2022 and rises to $12.9 million for 2023.

Use your healthcare accounts: Many workers have bigger balances than usual in their workplace healthcare flexible-spending accounts which allow employees to set aside pretax money from their paychecks to pay for medical expenses because of special Covid-related FSA carry-over rules. Now they are facing a Dec. 31 deadline to use their money or forfeit it. Check your FSA balance and your plan’s spend down rules now.

Take your losses: This year’s painful selloff brings an opportunity for investors to harvest losses in their brokerage accounts. Taxpayers who sell investments including crypto at a loss through Dec. 31 can offset gains on winners and up to $3000 of ordinary income on their 2022 tax return. Unused losses carry over to future years.

Make your required withdrawals: In most cases taxpayers 72 and older must take annual required minimum distributions or RMDs from traditional individual retirement accounts and 401(k)s by Dec. 31 or face a penalty of 50% of the amount they should have withdrawn. One exception: Those who turned 72 this year can wait until April 1 2023 to take their first RMD. Inherited IRAs both traditional and Roth have RMDs too with special rules for IRAs inherited in 2020 or later. A bill passed by Congress Friday raises the RMD age to 73 in 2023 and 75 in 2033 and reduces the penalty for missed RMDs.

When people are able to borrow capital get insured or save money in formal financial institutions they are able to live better lives. Yet the fact also remains that a major part of Bharat is still underserved and underinsured. For India to achieve a sustainable growth greater financial inclusion is crucial. Towards this purpose the fintech companies have largely been instrumental in providing greater access to financial products like credit savings investment micro-insurance.

Fintechs are rapidly becoming the face of financial empowerment globally particularly in economically diverse and emerging countries like ours. These new-age companies are experimenting and innovating on all fronts. The technological innovations aimed at breaking the barriers of the urban-rural divide are able to bring more tech-shy people within the realm of financial and digital inclusion. From tapping the retail network stretched across the country to implementing a ‘sachet’ or ‘bite-sized’ approach to target the un/underserved segments of the economy they are pushing India towards true financial empowerment.

Sachet approach: Hand-crafting customised financial services

The 1970s’ shampoo sachet revolution paved the way for sachetised services in India. Driving on customisation and cost economics fintechs have re-imagined their product offerings to address specific financial needs. By incorporating the key attributes of small ticket size short tenure and contextual need-based offerings sachetisation is leading the way to an omnipresent financial services distribution model.

In India the majority of the unbanked and underserved masses find it hard to transact with banks because they lack the financial know-how and are mostly tech-shy. So when it comes to designing financial products for the last mile it is crucial that they are easy-to-access and easy-to-consume. This is where sachetisation shines. It simplifies products and brings them within the reach of the general masses.

For instance insurance at INR 10 a month in small sachets catering to specific risk coverage is the first step to introduce the largely uninsured India’s last mile to the benefits of insurance. It will reduce the cost and make it accessible and affordable to the masses while protecting them from future uncertainties. Interestingly the sachet model has immense potential to influence consumption habits that can drive radical changes in the way insurance is perceived and consumed. Thus this micro-sized or bite-sized consumption behaviour can bring about a systemic change in the mindset towards other financial products like investments and even lending.

DaaS leveraging financial services in a ‘sachetised’ form

In the entire sachetisation journey Distribution-as-a-Service (DaaS) model has a crucial role to play. It is a framework that ensures local retailers today can make a host of financial and non-financial services readily available to the masses in an assisted mode through their stores. The services range from banking to e-commerce OTT to online education and travel to easy lending solutions that were earlier unavailable in rural areas. DaaS is a mission to simplify high-end technology for consumption at the last mile thereby democratising services and making the benefits of the modern world accessible to all. By utilising the power of technology it digitises sachetises and universalises products and services for last-mile distribution. It enables secure consumption for communities not part of the financial or digital mainstream. Now people can simply visit a local kirana shop and buy micro-insurance along with 1 kg potatoes or 1 kg pulses.

The secret lies in local trust. Given that they have been purchasing household items from them for years customers have faith in the owners of the nearby local kirana shops. The streamlined technology that serves as the backbone of the DaaS platform enables fast dependable and scalable solutions for service providers on one end and easy and steady consumption at local retailers on the other. It also enables a speedy error-free and trustworthy go-to-market which is one of the main success metrics for any distribution-led strategy. Every citizen can access high-end technology thanks to a micro-simplified sachetised delivery system.

Fintechs: Leading the inclusion brigade

New-age fintechs are paving the road for financial service sachetisation. From offering micro-insurance to micro-credit products fintechs are addressing the unmet needs of customers small-scale retailers across the country. However the implementation of a sachet service framework to serve the population across the country would require an architecture that is modular scalable API-driven and cloud-based. With multiple fintech players striving to provide financial and banking solutions the sachet model aims to empower microentrepreneurs and consumers alike creating a win-win situation for all.

Sachetised products that can be accessed anytime in any quantity according to specific requirements will stimulate aggregate demand and thereby economic growth. One of the key goals of sachet services is to transform luxury into affordability. Products like insurance which were earlier too distant for the masses are made available in small values. Sachetisation together with enhanced last-mile connectivity and distribution has the potential to truly transform the way people consume financial services in the country and pave the path to a financially empowered India.

Brooke Henderson Mackenzie Hughes and Adam Svensson's combined four wins between the LPGA and PGA Tours were highlights of the season. But the achievements of Canadian golfers were not limited to those victories.

Corey Conners and Taylor Pendrith became the first two Canadians to compete in the Presidents Cup at the same time Mike Weir was named the first-ever Canadian captain of the International team for the 2024 Presidents Cup at Royal Montreal Golf Club and the RBC Canadian Open and CP Women's Open both returned after a three-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""It's only getting better and that's been shown on the golf course and it continues to show"" said Hamilton Ont. native Hughes who won the Sanderson Farms Championship on Oct. 2 for the second PGA Tour title of his career. ""It's very exciting to be part of that winning group this year and to add to that total.

""I think that in the years to come you're going to see those records continue to fall. I wouldn't be surprised to see us eclipse that total once again in 2023.""

WATCH | Hughes wins Sanderson Farms Championship:

Mackenzie Hughes captures 2nd career PGA Tour title in playoff Duration 4:55 Dundas Ont. Mackenzie Hughes sunk the winning putt on the second playoff hole of the Sanderson Farms Championship to claim his second PGA Tour victory.

Henderson of Smiths Falls Ont. won the 11th and 12th tournaments of her career adding to her all-time Canadian record. She was victorious at the ShopRite LPGA Classic on June 12 and then won her second career major at the Evian Championship on July 24.

Despite playing through the season-ending CME Group Tour Championship with an injured back Henderson was still in contention to win the LPGA Tour's player of the year in the tournament's final round. Although Henderson tied for seventh at that tournament and New Zealand's Lydia Ko won the annual award it was still impressive finish to an exceptional year for the Canadian.

""I just love being in contention and being near the top of the leaderboards on the weekend. Hopefully I can do more of that in 2023"" said Henderson who won two tournaments each LPGA Tour season in 2016 2017 2018 and 2019. After the circuit lost its 2020 season Henderson won once in 2021 and was eager to start a new streak of multi-win years.

""Hopefully I can do more of that in 2023. I really wanted to get off to a hot start (in 2022) and try to get more top 10s and be in better positions on the weekends especially coming off a year where I won one.""

WATCH | Henderson wins her 2nd career major:

Henderson wins Evian Championship to collect her 2nd-career major Duration 3:24 Smiths Falls Ontario native Brooke Henderson battled back from a rough start on Sunday to win in France by one stroke.

The same day Henderson was finishing out her season Surrey B.C. native Svensson won on the PGA Tour for the first time of his career with a two-stroke victory at the RSM Classic.

On Sept. 22 Conners and Pendrith made their Presidents Cup debuts. The two best friends were the first Canadian duo to play in a Presidents Cup at the same time with Hughes and Adam Hadwin also considered to make the International team at the best-on-best tournament at Quail Hollow Golf Club in Charlotte N.C.

WATCH | Svensson wins RSM Classic:

B.C.'s Adam Svensson clinches 1st PGA Tour win at RSM Classic Duration 2:21 The Surrey B.C. native fired off six birdies in the final round to finish at -19 for his first career Tour victory.

The next Presidents Cup will have even more of a maple flavour as Royal Montreal Golf Club hosts the 2024 edition and Weir serves as the International team's captain. The Canadian Golf Hall of Famer joked that after his was introduced as the team captain at Bell Centre on Nov. 30 his phone was blowing up with messages from Canada's PGA Tour players eager to make the team.

""We have a huge country land-wise to try to bring everybody together as best we can and make sure that they feel like this is part of our golf legacy"" said Weir after closing the Toronto Stock Exchange on Dec. 1. ""We want people coming from Vancouver Calgary Edmonton from the East Coast Halifax.

""I'm hoping they want to come and see the best players in the world compete.""

Golf makes its return to Canada after pandemic

Top-flight professional golf made its return to Canada in 2022 after the COVID-19 pandemic put the RBC Canadian Open and CP Women's Open on hiatus for two years.

Golf Canada reported that the Canadian Open drew a record 135000 spectators to Toronto's St. George's Golf and Country Club as superstar Rory McIlroy won the national title for the second consecutive time.

The Women's Open drew over 70000 fans to Ottawa Hunt and Golf Club earning Tournament of the Year honours from the Tournament Partners of the LPGA. Tourism Ottawa said that the event had an expected economic impact of $13.4 million as the National Capital Region's hospitality sector tried to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and anti-government protests that gridlocked Ottawa in February.

In recognition of the economic benefits of hosting the two national golf championships Canada's Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario gave Golf Canada $4.4 million in September. The non-repayable investment is earmarked for the Canadian Open and the Women's Open.

Mona Fortier president of the Treasury Board and member of Parliament for Ottawa-Vanier said the investment will help the tournaments stimulate local economies.

The men's championship is typically held in the Greater Toronto Area and will be at Oakdale Golf & Country Club in 2023 while the women's event travels across Canada with next year's tournament scheduled for Vancouver's Shaughnessy Golf & Country Club.

Garrett Ball Golf Canada's chief operating officer said in September that the organization was approached by the federal development agency about the investment in 2021. He said that the money will go in part a new double-decker hospitality suite as well as the development of new mobile phone apps for spectators at the two events.

""Simply put these are innovative assets that will benefit the championships for the foreseeable future"" said Ball. ""In fact at the RBC Canadian Open in June these assets were major factors in the announcement of record sales record crowds and record media impressions.""",,,,,,,,,

Kinetic Energy starts parts production,"Source: Navbharat Times - Image is used for representational purpose only KEL has not disclosed details on E-Luna's design yet.

CHAL MERI LUNA

Kinetic Engineering Ltd (KEL) is all set to resurrect the iconic ‘Luna’ moped in an electric avatar for India. The manufacturer reports that it has started the production of the chassis and components for the upcoming ‘E-Luna’. Components such as the main chassis main stand side stand and swing arm has begun on a dedicated production line with an initial capacity of 5000 sets per month at the Ahmednagar plant near Pune.The original Kinetic Luna was first introduced in the country in 1972. It was a moped that features a 50 cc engine and was a licensed copy of the Piaggio Ciao. At the time it was a well known product around the country through creative jingles such as the ‘Chal Meri Luna’ advertisement. After a 28 year production run Kinetic Engineering had stopped the production of the Luna in early 2000.Now the company is all set to bring the moped back as an EV. It will be launched by KEL’s sister company Kinetic Green Energy & Power Solutions Ltd. KERL has set up a brand new line of over 30 welding machines in an exclusive shop within the plant. All the assemblies will be fully finished and painted in the Ahmednagar unit. To meet the requirements KEL has also invested over Rs 3 crores in upgrading its paint shop and press & fabrication shops.However KEL has not yet disclosed any details on the design and features that the E-Luna will sport. Details relating to battery capacity range and performance are also being awaited as of now.Speaking on the development Ajinkya Firodia  MD Kinetic Engineering Limited said “At its peak Luna was selling over 2000 units per day. I am sure it will do very well in its new avatar. We expect this business to add over Rs 30 crores annually over the next 2 to 3 years as the volumes of the E-Luna increase. This will also help KEL to boost its presence in the EV segment.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L29pbC1nYXMvbGF3LWxpa2VseS10by1iZS1hbWVuZGVkLXRvLXJldGFrZS1zb21lLXBvd2Vycy1mcm9tLXBldHJvLXJlZ3VsYXRvci9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjUyNjE0Mi5jbXPSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5L2VuZXJneS9vaWwtZ2FzL2xhdy1saWtlbHktdG8tYmUtYW1lbmRlZC10by1yZXRha2Utc29tZS1wb3dlcnMtZnJvbS1wZXRyby1yZWd1bGF0b3IvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk2NTI2MTQyLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Law likely to be amended to retake some powers from petro regulator,"

The government is planning to amend the law to claw back some power from the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board ( PNGRB ) which will help it intervene to resolve some of the contentious issues plaguing the sector such as the monopolies of the city gas licensees according to people familiar with the matter.The planned amendment also aims to eliminate the current provisions for imprisonment up to three years for marketing oil and gas or building pipelines and liquefied natural gas terminals without the regulator's nod the people said.The government aims to introduce the amendment to the PNGRB Act 2006 in the budget session of Parliament. The amendment will arm the regulator with appropriate legal provisions to deal with the emerging opportunities and challenges in the hydrocarbon sector said the people.""The Act needs to be strengthened in some ways so that PNGRB has the powers to deal with new molecules such as hydrogen and ammonia as well as new market mechanisms such as gas trading or the exchange"" said one of the persons who did not wish to be identified.The Act covers only fossil fuels Hydrogen ammonia and biogas are likely to play a big role in meeting the country's energy needs in future. Companies are piloting blending of hydrogen with natural gas while the government is considering mandating the use of green hydrogen and ammonia by refiners and fertiliser plants. Biogas is already being mixed with natural gas and supplied to customers.The amendment may also provide the legal backing for setting up a transport system operator which has been delayed for nearly two years. The transport system operator is expected to manage the common carrier capacity of all natural gas pipelines in the country.One key driver of the planned amendment is to bring back some power to the government so that the latter can intervene quickly to resolve issues that fester for long the person cited above said. A key issue has been the inability of the PNGRB to end the city gas companies' exclusive rights to operate in dozens of licensed areas. The current law empowers the regulator to decide on the period of exclusivity for city gas companies but its attempts at ending exclusivity have met with legal challenges.The PNGRB has been without a chairman for two years. The government has run the candidate selection process multiple times but hasn't been able to appoint a chairman yet.Last month the regulator decided to have a uniform tariff for natural gas pipelines which will help lower transport cost for consumers sitting far from the supply sources.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS9lbmVyZ3kvcG93ZXIvbGFuY28tYW1hcmthbnRhay1yZXNvbHV0aW9uLWZhY2VzLWRlbGF5cy9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjUwMTM0OS5jbXPSAXdodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvZW5lcmd5L3Bvd2VyL2xhbmNvLWFtYXJrYW50YWstcmVzb2x1dGlvbi1mYWNlcy1kZWxheXMvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk2NTAxMzQ5LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lanco Amarkantak resolution faces delays,"

While banks are set to vote to select a winner for Lanco Amarkantak Power  an inter-creditor dispute stemming from the unfair treatment of secured minority lenders is simmering and could be heading for litigation that could delay the resolution.Minority debt holders with superior security led by Edelweiss Asset reconstruction Company have alleged that the distribution of the proceeds from the sale of the power company is against the tenets of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and designed to favour creditors with inferior security such as Power Finance Corporation PFC ) and REC - who hold 41% of the debt.The resolution professional Saurabh Kumar Tikmani backed by KPMG invited lenders last week to vote on the resolution plans given by the PFC-REC team Adani Power and Reliance Industries . The voting will end on December 30.Lanco Amarkantak which has been undergoing bankruptcy proceedings comprises three phases. The first phase has two units of 300 MW each of which is operational while the second phase which has two units of 660 MW each is under construction. The third phases have two units each of 660 MW which is at the conceptualisation stage.The company has generated ₹1400 crore cash and ₹300 crore receivables solely from the operation of phase one units which are exclusively charged with Edelweiss ARC Canara Bank and UCO Bank Despite this most lenders including PFC REC and Axis Bank  decided to distribute the proceeds from the sale of the power company in the ratio of the admitted claim said people aware of the matter. Distribution of proceeds based on claims will significantly lower the recovery for phase one lenders who have referred the matter to the Hyderabad bench of the NCLT.Interestingly the PFC-REC team also emerged as the highest bidder for Lanco Amarkantak offering an upfront payment of ₹3020 crore at an auction held on December 1. Adani Power and Reliance Industries which were in the fray boycotted the auction. Both expressed dissatisfaction over the last-minute changes in the bidding process that favoured the majority lenders the PFC-REC team who was also a resolution applicant as reported by ET on December 2.""The decision on the distribution mechanism is in complete disregard to the security structure"" said a legal expert dealing in insolvency cases. In Essar Steel's resolution the Supreme Court ruled that distribution should be based on the quality of the security held by the lender. Thus Standard Chartered Bank received 2% of proceeds due to the inferior security it held despite having a 7% voting share.Edelweiss ARC declined to comment stating that the matter is pending in court.The Hyderabad bench on October 19 comprising VRD Nandula as a judicial member and VBR Arekapud as a technical member expressed divergent opinions regarding the appeal by phase one creditors. The matter is referred to a third referee member who will hear the case on January 5.The technical member directed the Committee of Creditors (CoC) to undertake an equitable mechanism of distribution of proceeds while instructing the RP to make a fresh estimation of the liquidation value since the company generated cash solely from phase one operations. Phase one creditors have sought a recomputing the liquidation value so that potential dissenting creditors receive a minimum amount.""It is understood that the majority CoC with its brute majority bulldozed the previous proposal and arrived at the present mechanism to the detriment of the lenders of Phase-I thereby denying the said lenders the benefits that rightfully accrue to them by virtue of the lending agreements and commercial bargains that were entered into pre-insolvency"" the technical judge stated.The CoC had earlier agreed to put on the vote two options on the distribution mechanism: based on security held and based on claims. But later it modified the proposal and put only one proposal for vote based on claims.When the company entered corporate insolvency in September 2019 the liquidation value arrived at ₹2241 crore wherein ₹1146 crore was assigned for the first phase and ₹1095 crore jointly for the second and third phases.The legal counsel of the phase one lenders pointed out that the distribution of proceeds after recomputing the liquidation value is robbing the potential dissenting creditor of even its assured minimum safeguard.The judicial member agreed that the modified distribution mechanism (based on admitted claims) ""proposed by the majority lenders has been suggested as an afterthought solely to deprive the phase one lenders of the rightful entitlement of the proceeds from the resolution plan through an opaque and arbitrary mechanism"".However the judicial member also stated that CoC's commercial wisdom is paramount because at the 37th CoC meeting 85.2% of lenders voted in favour of the distribution of the proceeds based on the admitted claims.The RP has admitted ₹14632 crore claims from 17 lenders.",,,

I had come for a few days this past fall dutifully overloading my senses and depleting my wallet every time I left my hotel room. But at a dinner one night with a large group of colleagues I heard the first rumblings of discontent and unfulfilled wishes. ""You wouldn't"" the woman next to me at our table asked the waiter gently ""just happen by any chance to have Coke?"" He shook his head. She'd already guessed as much.

""Am I tripping or is everything here Pepsi products?""

Vegas is a Pepsi town — so much a Pepsi town that it's one of the few places in the world that's ever served Pepsi in some of its McDonald's locations. If you go on travel forums you will discover spirited discussions about how tricky it can be to find a Coke or as one Redditor put is earlier this year ""Am I tripping or is everything here Pepsi products?"" And if you Google ""Las Vegas Pepsi"" your results will produce the plaintive ""Why is there no Coke in Las Vegas?"" Naturally once I realized this I wanted nothing else from Sin City but an icy bottle of the Real Thing.

There is in fact Coke to be found in Vegas most notably in some higher-end properties like the Bellagio. There is even a Coca-Cola store on the Strip so you won't be deprived if that's your preference. But as the Vital Vegas guide noted back in 2019 ""The Strip is Pepsi dominated as the big casino companies have deals with Pepsi."" Caesars properties for instance are Pepsi zones. And with Pepsi comes its suite of other beverages — handy to know if you're a fan of Mountain Dew. But considering the deluge of advertising for Bacardi I encountered in my hotel I did find myself wondering if my cocktail hour plans might have to include a rum and…. Pepsi.

Pepsi's relationship with the town shows up in other ways. In 2020 PepsiCo launched its Dig In initiative to support Black owned restaurants across the country which just this fall featured a Restaurant Royalty Residency program to ""bring signature dishes from Black-owned restaurants"" to MGM properties in Las Vegas.

In hindsight I can see how Pepsi with its somewhat edgier brand identity is a natural fit for Vegas. It likewise checks out that wholesome all-American Coke in contrast dominates the happiest place on earth.

The Disney relationship goes back to before there were even Disney theme parks. As Chelsea Burnett Alliance Manager of Disney Corporate Alliances wrote on the Disney Parks blog last year ""Our relationship with Coca-Cola started in 1942 when Walt Disney first appeared on the Coca-Cola radio program 'The Pause That Refreshes on the Air.'"" Coke was on the menu when Disneyland opened back in 1955 but it's been the parks' exclusive beverage provider since the 1980's. Today the company's products are ubiquitous in Disney parks all around the world.

Theme parks and casinos are of course just a larger manifestation of the kind of corporate contracts that not so subtly guide our recreational consumption choices. Julian Goldie CEO of the SEO link-building Goldie Agency notes ""A movie theater may enter into a partnership with a particular soda brand and exclusively serve that brand in their concessions or an amusement park may be sponsored by a particular snack food company and feature their products throughout the park. Brands can often guide our choices through strategic product placement and promotional efforts. For example a casino may prominently display certain brands of beverages near popular gaming areas or a music venue may offer discounts on certain brands of drinks as part of a special promotion."" Or Caesars may choose like it did this spring the High Roller wheel as the perfect place to launch a Pepsi Nitro pop-up experience. The result as Steven Zhang founder of the tea culture blog TeaJust notes is that ""these tactics create an association between the brand and the experience of enjoying a night out.""

If you're very a brand-loyal traveler you might want to do some advance work before you take off so you're not already ordering room service before you learn that Pepsi is the drink of choice in Marriott's over 6300 properties. And if you're thirsty for the thing that refreshes you most you might have to get out and stock up. Matt James of the travel blog Visitingly suggests ""If you are in a 'Coke town' and want a Pepsi you can usually find one at a convenience store or grocery store. You may also be able to request a different brand of soda at restaurants or bars although they may not always have it available."" When all else fails you can always just order something else — but it wouldn't be quite the same right?

I am not enough of a soda consumer to usually care — or notice — the soft drink culture of a particular town or resort. (I have however been known to get feisty about the beer offerings at certain stadiums.) But the elusiveness of Coke in Vegas made it absolutely tantalizing to me. There Coca-Cola glittered like an effervescent dream in my imagination as out of reach as a row of cherries on a slot machine. I bought a bottle at my bodega when I got home. It was okay. But like so many things about Las Vegas getting it wasn't as good as wanting it had been.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG93ZWVrLmNvbS9yYWNpbmcvbmFzY2FyL2E0MjMwOTA0Mi90aGUtaW5keS01MDAtY29jYS1jb2xhLTYwMC1kb3VibGUtcHV0LW5ldy1zcG90bGlnaHQtb24tbWVtb3JpYWwtZGF5LXdlZWtlbmQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Indy 500 Coca-Cola 600 Double Put New Spotlight on Memorial Day Weekend,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.autoweek.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /racing/nascar/a42309042/the-indy-500-coca-cola-600-double-put-new-spotlight-on-memorial-day-weekend/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021224F85BA0>, 'Connection to www.autoweek.com timed out.

While English fans may be kicking back with a pint of beer and French fans with a deep glass of wine Argentinian fans are toasting to victory with their national drink Fernet con Coca.

For the uninitiated Fernet is an Italian aromatic spirit. This bitter 45% ABV spice-heavy concoction is made from a base of distilled grape spirits mixed with the likes of myrrh rhubarb chamomile cardamom aloe and saffron. In terms of color and flavor it’s often likened to Jägermeister.

Invented in 1845 Fernet was introduced to Argentina through the great wave of European immigration that the country saw in the late 19th and early 20th century.

The spirit’s presence would lay relatively dormant until the 1980s when the Fernet con Coca cocktail saw a huge surge in popularity among college students in the city of Cordoba.

Today the cocktail’s popularity is allegedly surpassed only by that of beer and wine. It’s consumed at family gatherings and pre-games enjoyed both by the older generation and the new. It has become an emblematic cultural icon one that has established Argentina as a consumer of more than 75% of the world’s Fernet supply.

So what’s actually in it?

Simple enough — the cocktail is a two-part mix of Fernet and Coca-Cola. If you can get your hands on a bottle of Fernet just follow the easy steps below and you’ll be ready to commemorate the end of 2022’s iconic World Cup.

Fernet con Coca

Ingredients

3 oz Fernet

CTSH,Cognizant,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vanVzdHdvbWVuc3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vcmVhZHMvbndzbC1qZXNzaWNhLWJlcm1hbi1mdXR1cmUtaW52ZXN0bWVudC1hYnVzZS1yZXBvcnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jessica Berman: NWSL is ‘rebuilding the future of the league’,"The NWSL had its foundation shaken by a wide-reaching abuse scandal but the league is reestablishing its trust with players and rebuilding its future as it heads into 2023 commissioner Jessica Berman said.

Before the NWSL could move forward it needed to prove itself to players Berman told Lisa Leslie and Tracy Wolfson on the Dec. 25 episode of CBS Sports show “We Need to Talk.”

Berman joined the NWSL in April six months after former commissioner Lisa Baird resigned. Baird who had started as commissioner in February 2020 left the post after misconduct allegations against coaches rocked the league throughout the 2021 season.

The allegations culminated in two reports published this fall one commissioned by U.S. Soccer and one undertaken by the NWSL and NWSLPA which detailed “systemic” abuse.

“You can’t take steps forward to build the future of the league without rebuilding the credibility of our league and it starts with listening” she said. “I sat in every locker room in person and sat with the players to listen and learn about their experience and to understand their vision for how we rebuild the future of the league.”

The 2022 season ended with one marker of success in Berman’s view: When two of the NWSL’s 12 teams played for the championship on Oct. 29 61 players from the 10 other teams attended the match as spectators.

The commissioner wanted to invite players to the final match between the Portland Thorns and Kansas City Current at Audi Field so they could recognize where the league has been but also celebrate where it is going.

“If we could get players to come to what is our tentpole event which is our championship game it would really be an indication to me internally that we’re doing the right things” Berman said. “We’re setting the league on the right path… So these 61 players coming to Washington D.C. was just incredible.”

“Women’s sports in no longer thought of as charity or nice to have or part of a corporate social responsibility budget. This is part of investment for the future of sports.”@NWSL Commissioner @JessicaBerman1 on the future of #womenssports and the #NWSL. pic.twitter.com/gWzWeyHON5 — We Need To Talk (@WeNeedToTalk) December 25 2022

With 2023 just around the corner and expansion on the horizon in 2024 Berman sees a bright future for the NWSL — and for all women’s sports.

“Women’s sports in no longer thought of as charity or nice to have or part of a corporate social responsibility budget” Berman said. “This is part of investment for the future of sports. And when that paradigm shifted which I would say happened over the last year or so culturally in the world it really changed the future of what is possible in the NWSL.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndwdHYuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy9mb290YmFsbC9kb2xwaGlucy9kb2xwaGlucy1xdWFydGVyYmFjay10dWEtdGFnb3ZhaWxvYS1pbi1jb25jdXNzaW9uLXByb3RvY29sLWFnYWlu0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tagovailoa in concussion protocol again; status uncertain,"MIAMI GARDENS Fla. — Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa has returned to the NFL's concussion protocol Miami coach Mike McDaniel said Monday.

Tagovailoa met with doctors a day after the Dolphins' 26-20 loss to Green Bay and was experiencing concussion symptoms.

Teddy Bridgewater is expected to get most of the first-team reps in practice this week but McDaniel said it is too early to name a starter for Miami's game at New England on Sunday.

It is the second time this season that Tagovailoa has been in the concussion protocol. He took a scary hit that knocked him unconscious during Miami's Week 4 game at Cincinnati. He was stretchered off the field and returned in Week 7.

Tagovailoa took another hard hit four days before the Cincinnati game during a win over Buffalo. He appeared to show concussion symptoms but was evaluated and stayed in the game. The NFL later changed its concussion protocol to mandate that any player who shows possible concussion symptoms — including a lack of balance or stability — sit out the remainder of a game.

The injury comes at a challenging time for Miami (8-7) which has lost four straight to fall to the bottom of the AFC playoff field.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9qb2JzL2luZGlhLWluYy10by1oaXJlLW1vcmUtd29tZW4tdGhpcy1uZXcteWVhci1pbi1kaXZlcnNpdHktcHVzaC9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjUwMTQ4Ni5jbXPSAXpodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vam9icy9pbmRpYS1pbmMtdG8taGlyZS1tb3JlLXdvbWVuLXRoaXMtbmV3LXllYXItaW4tZGl2ZXJzaXR5LXB1c2gvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk2NTAxNDg2LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India Inc to hire more women this new year in diversity push,"Corporate India wants more women within its ranks - and come 2023 it's all geared up to intensify the push toward that end.Leading organisations including Cognizant Larsen & Toubro HDFC Bank ITC  KPMG Axis Bank Cipla and Procter & Gamble are doubling down on efforts to improve gender diversity in the workplace. Initiatives taken include among others offering flexible work arrangements improving the intake of women at trainee and campus levels providing access to mentoring and employee resource groups hiring more women at leadership levels and initiating programmes to attract second-career women.""Diversity helps in getting best ideas and driving innovation"" said C Jayakumar head corporate human resources L&T. ""Many studies have shown how diverse teams tend to outperform others. As for gender diversity from the talent market point of view a progressive organisation like ours can't miss out on this large talent pool.""At several companies flexibility is a focus area to attract women.ITC has additional flexibility in work arrangements for expectant and young mothers extended maternity and childcare leave and travel support for infants and caregivers during business travel by women employees. At Axis Bank alternate work formats are used to bring in diverse talent. A pilot for bank's Gig-A-Opportunities programme saw 44% women hired including some young mothers returning to work virtually said Rajkamal Vempati head of HR at Axis Bank.At L&T if any woman employee needs to relocate to a different city the company tries to facilitate that.""When a diverse workforce is supported by an equitable and inclusive workplace compassion creativity and conviction get unleashed which in turn reinforces the competitiveness of the enterprise"" said Amitav Mukherji head corporate human resources ITC.At HDFC Bank the current gender ratio stands at 23.3 % having risen over the past quarters as the bank formalised its structured approach to diversity. As part of its inclusion agenda it has created a three-tier governance structure to achieve its objectives and launched multiple internal campaigns on the themes of diversity said Vinay Razdan CHRO HDFC Bank.Second-career women comprise a pool that companies are tapping actively as is the campus hiring route. HDFC Bank for instance has the Bank Again Programme for Women that provides an opportunity to high-calibre women professionals to join the workforce through two approaches: returning to work after a career break as well as rehiring those who left in the past five years.Senior leadership is actively driving the agenda. At Cognizant executive leadership compensation in 2022 included a metric focused on gender diversity globally and developing and retaining talent said Shameka Young global head of diversity and inclusion Cognizant.Since 2020 every leader at the level of director and above has had a target relative to their business area for hiring and retaining women at the senior manager level and above.""We work to expand and grow these numbers through various programmes including Propel our female leadership development programme and our Returnship programme for talented technology professionals"" Young said. ""The programme began in 2021 in India and has since expanded throughout India and to the US. Returners have access to mentorship training upskilling and work with cutting-edge technology. At the end of the programme they are considered for full-time employment.""Efforts range across levels from entry to leadership. In the next three years Schneider Electric aims to have women as 50% of its new hires 40% of frontline managers and 30% of senior leadership said Rachna Mukherjee CHRO India and South Asia.Consumer goods maker P&G is heavily focusing on STEM and is working on building the digital skills of women across its external network. Nearly 35% of managers at its manufacturing sites are women.""We are committed to building equality and inclusion into the core of our business"" said Srinivas PM head of human resources P&G India subcontinent.Pharmaceutical company Cipla has launched several initiatives to drive inclusion. This includes Flexi Field Days a policy that offers the women in its field force two days of flexibility to work from home. There’s also a constant focus on having more gender-diverse profiles for hiring at all levels and employee resources groups said Raju Mistry global chief people officer CiplaAt KPMG in India diversity at lateral hires is approximately at 42% and at 49% for campus hires.

Rising costs debt-ridden balance sheets and a renewed focus on profitability weighed on the embattled sector as investors quickly punished companies struggling to turn a profit.

Netflix (NFLX) shares are down about 50% on the year while companies like Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Spotify (SPOT) have sunk more than 60% with Roku (ROKU) plummeting a whopping 80%.

Cable operators Fox (FOX) and Comcast (CMCSA) dropped roughly 20% and 30% respectively as Paramount Global (PARA) shares plunged more than 45%.

Disney (DIS) once a Wall Street darling also slid 45% on the year and the stock is heading toward its worst year since 1974 after the much-anticipated ""Avatar"" sequel missed opening weekend expectations to cap off a challenging year for the House of Mouse.

In this year alone the stock market wiped a whopping $500 billion-plus in market capitalization from the world's biggest media cable and entertainment companies with more pain expected in 2023 amid higher interest rates and an unfavorable macroeconomic environment.

So what exactly happened — and what could happen next?

Wall Street's profit push: 'Time to be a real company'

2022 was a clear ""soul searching"" year for media after the industry experienced a bumpy ride throughout the pandemic with record highs and jarring lows.

As the ""stay at home"" trade ran its course peak subscriber penetration levels in the U.S. and Canada resulted in streaming companies quickly seeing growth flatten.

Netflix the long-time leader of the streaming wars lost subscribers for the first time in its history as its market cap sank from more than $267 billion at the end of 2021 to roughly $130 billion.

Similarly NBCUniversal's Peacock experienced zero growth in its second quarter although subscribers rebounded in Q3 with 2 million net additions.

Stalling subscriber growth has led to heightened criticism of production budgets which have sharply increased as competition intensifies. Netflix committed $18 billion to content alone in 2022 while Disney upped its budget by $8 billion this year to $33 billion.

Among companies that have begun to pivot from linear to streaming (excluding platforms like Netflix Amazon and Apple) direct-to-consumer content spending jumped from $2.7 billion in 2019 to $15.6 billion in 2021 according to Wells Fargo data cited by Variety.

That number is expected to balloon to nearly $24 billion this year — despite mounting streaming losses.

Disney's direct-to-consumer division shed a whopping $4 billion-plus in its fiscal 2022 which ended on October 1. Meanwhile Paramount told investors streaming losses would total about $1.8 billion this year — higher than Wall Street expectations.

Story continues

Warner Bros. Discovery which has seen its market cap cut in half amid its messy restructuring efforts reported free cash flow of negative $192 million in the third quarter compared to $705 million in positive cash flow the year prior. The company now plans to take on $3.5 billion in content impairment and development write-offs by 2024.

Ad-supported 'pivotal' for industry

Amid the race to profitability advertising has become one potential bright spot for investors — despite the global slowdown in ad spending.

Netflix and Disney jumped on the ad-supported bandwagon this year joining Warner Bros. Discovery's HBO Max NBCUniversal's Peacock and Paramount Global's Paramount+.

Netflix rolled out its $6.99 offering in November while Disney+ followed one month later at a price point of $7.99. Wall Street analysts remain largely bullish on the profitability aspects of ad tiers while advertising experts have referred to the debuts as a make-or-break moment for the media industry.

""It is absolutely a pivotal moment for the industry"" Kevin Krim CEO of advertising measurement platform EDO previously told Yahoo Finance.

""I think what we have learned as an industry is that there's a limit to the number of consumers out there that will pay"" Krim said. ""Advertising is a really smart way to subsidize those subscription fees.""

Industry experts agree offering lower-cost ad-supported options serve as an important hedge against churn — something all streamers want to avoid amid increased competition.

""I'm a big fan of giving consumers an option for an ad tier"" Jon Christian EVP of digital media supply chain at Qvest the largest media & entertainment-focused consulting company told Yahoo Finance.

Christian added data will be a big driver (and potential money maker) when it comes to more targeted advertising in 2023: ""Data can drive up the pricing of the different ads they're pushing on the platform.""

Still the benefits of ad-supported will likely take time to mature.

Netflix's ad tier already appears to be undergoing some serious growing pains — including reports of insufficient sign-ups and failed viewership guarantees. Analysts however caution it's still early days.

Analysts eye next media merger

Coupled with a greater focus on content spend and advertising investors should also expect more media merger activity next year.

Wells Fargo analyst Steve Cahall wrote in a recent note: ""Our 2023 predictions indicate Media and Cable sectors reacting to generally harder times both cyclical and structural. Tough times mean tough decisions.""

Possible acquisition targets in 2023 and beyond include the embattled Warner Bros. Discovery.

Lionsgate's film and TV studio which the entertainment giant plans to spin off into a separate company will also be for sale while AMC Networks (AMCX) continues to undergo a restructuring that could result in an acquisition.

Needham's Laura Martin wrote in a recent client note Paramount could be attractive to unload while smaller players like WWE (WWE) Curiosity Stream (CURIW) and Chicken Soup for the Soul (CSSE) will likely sell due to their size.

Disney CEO Bob Iger who returned to the media conglomerate to much fanfare in November will also face a slew of decisions — including what to do with notable assets like Hulu (sell it to Comcast?) and sports behemoth ESPN (spin it off?).

Layoffs hiring freezes hit big media

Amid greater profitability concerns media giants have enacted mass layoffs and hiring freezes in an attempt to stop the bleeding. More than 3000 jobs have been cut through October this year according to data from Challenger Gray & Christmas cited by Axios.

Netflix laid off about 150 positions of the streamer’s 11000 workforce in May blaming the headcount reduction on ""slowing revenue growth"" and a greater depletion in spending.

Earlier this month Warner Bros. Discovery revealed prominent Discovery executives will be exiting the company after it axed CNN+ nixed more CNN staffers and slashed 14% of its HBO Max workforce this year.

So far the company has eliminated a reported 1000-plus jobs across units as WBD CEO David Zaslav doubles down on restructuring efforts which have also included scrapped projects and programs.

Paramount Global began to cut jobs in November targeting its ad sales group according to Deadline while AMC Networks (AMCX) announced plans to lay off about 20% of its U.S. workforce amid CEO Christina Spade's exit.

AMC Chairman James Dolan reportedly told employees the network has struggled to offset cable declines as cord cutting accelerates referencing the company's owned-streaming entities like AMC+ and horror platform Shudder.

Similarly Comcast's cable unit made job cuts in November while Roku (ROKU) slashed 200 jobs or 5% of its workforce shortly after its third quarter earnings results.

Theatrical comeback still TBD

Avatar: The Way of Water

The theatrical industry continued to recover from pandemic losses in 2022 — although whether a complete comeback will be made remains to be seen.

Films like ""Top Gun: Maverick"" broke records while Marvel's ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" and ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" easily nabbed $100 million-plus domestic openers.

Still Disney's ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" secured just $134 million in domestic markets over its three-day opening weekend missing expectations and sending Disney shares to their lowest level since March 2020.

Despite the miss theater executives championed the debut surmising the movie will steadily add box office dollars over the holidays and well into 2023.

Streaming giants have embraced the theatrical as well with Netflix's ""Knives Out: Glass Onion"" enjoying a successful limited theatrical release over Thanksgiving week while Amazon will reportedly invest $1 billion to produce 12 to 15 movies a year exclusively for theaters.

Overall the domestic box office is estimated to bring roughly $7.4 billion for the year according to Box Office Pro. Although that number still lags pre-pandemic figures by about 30% there is hope that next year's more beefed-up release schedule will help close the gap.

Betty Francisco remembers all too well how hard it was to find financing for her startup fitness business Reimagine Play. She had established a professional network in the city first as an attorney for dot-coms and venture capital firms and later as in-house counsel for Sports Club/LA.

Her fitness business did not pan out. But Francisco is helping dozens of other entrepreneurs of color avoid similar hardships as the chief executive of the Boston Impact Initiative a nonprofit fund manager. BII’s first fund placed some $7 million with about 50 businesses. Francisco recently launched the second fund aiming to raise $20 million to support entrepreneurs of color and community-governed real estate; so far BII has raised about $3 million. Both of these funds are debt funds in which investors receive promissory notes rather than stock and BII invests both debt and equity into the startups that benefit. Investments in the new fund can range from $1000 to $25000 for people with ordinary means and from $10000 to $3 million for accredited investors and philanthropies.

The second fund will broaden BII’s geographic reach to include more of Massachusetts beyond Greater Boston as well as other New England states.

As cofounder of Amplify Latinx Francisco knows how important it can be to have a powerful advocacy organization on your side. But advocacy can only go so far. With BII Francisco said BII has financial resources to help small business owners reach critical mass. Helping them build equity can lead to systemic change by bringing wealth to communities that often lack it. It’s one reason she left her job at Compass Working Capital to join BII as its chief executive in 2021 taking over for its cofounder Deborah Frieze.

“As a leader within the Boston community that talks about racial justice and how we can amplify leaders of color we are very limited if we just have one tool advocacy” Francisco said. “This organization gives me a very different footprint that allows me to create a fund that is about moving capital but also about advocating for the field to change.”

The hard lessons of her fitness venture from several years ago remind her what BII’s beneficiaries are up against.

“Massachusetts is so rich in resources but it doesn’t often reach entrepreneurs of color or women” she said. “I’m pretty well-networked. I know where to look. And even I had a challenging time.”

A new boss brings a new name to Community & Banking Council

Tom Callahan has been on staff at the Massachusetts Community & Banking Council for just under a year and he’s already shaking things up.

Callahan left his longtime position running the Massachusetts Affordable Housing Alliance a year ago to be the MCBC’s executive director. Now the council overseen by a mix of bankers and activists has a new name and identity the Partnership for Financial Equity. (The original legal name will continue but the “Partnership” moniker will be the name the public sees now.)

It’s a big change for a council that has been around for 32 years created after the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston discovered discriminatory lending practices among many of Boston’s biggest banks.

The council was assembled to monitor banks’ community lending commitments and to maintain an open dialogue between activist organizations and the industry. It recently hired Woodstock Institute a Chicago think tank to produce its annual reports on mortgage and small business lending.

Callahan said the new name was created to underscore the council’s mission as well as to reflect a board decision to get more engaged in public policy — by weighing in on new Community Investment Act rules for example or studying state legislation that would require more disclosures for small business loans.

“‘Massachusetts Community Banking Council’ is a mouthful [and] it never said much to anybody” Callahan said. “We as a board sat down earlier this year and said ‘Let’s come up with a name that reflects what we’re trying to accomplish.”

AT&T chief’s footprint just got bigger.

John Emra just got one of those promotions in which he now has to do the job of three-plus people. But he doesn’t seem to mind one bit.

Emra had been the New England president for Dallas-based telecom giant AT&T but now oversees the entire Atlantic region combining his previous position and at least two others.

Emra is embracing the territory which stretches from rural parts of West Virginia to the coast of Maine. He likes the variety and the impact that the region’s big cities such as Boston New York and Washington have on the world. It means a lot of time on the road for the Southern Connecticut resident who grew up in Boston’s western suburbs. The territory doesn’t include local phone service but does cover cell service and fiber optic lines. He’s a familiar face around Boston in part because he helps spearhead AT&T’s philanthropy and university partnerships in the area and occasionally sneaks in a game at TD Garden or Fenway Park.

Keeping tabs on such a large region wouldn’t be possible to do well without some assistance and Emra says he’s getting that help from some of the best in the business: his colleagues.

“Managing high performers is the best thing you could do as a manager” Emra said. “Being able to manage a great team of people is a blessing.”

Defense industry pro Donovan strikes out on his own.

After building a career out of connecting defense company leaders with their government counterparts while at law firm Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough Joe Donovan is striking out on his own. The lobbyist is leaving the law firm’s Boston office to open his own firm Donovan Strategies — above the restaurant space where he held his first job as a teenager in Randolph.

Donovan earned his stripes working in then-governor Mitt Romney’s administration alongside then-economic affairs secretary Ranch Kimball in part to protect Hanscom Air Force Base and the Natick Soldier Systems Center from being shut down in a massive round of base closures. He has spent more than a decade with Nelson Mullins whose roots are in South Carolina and has become an expert in the Massachusetts defense sector. He brings several clients with him to his new practice including General Dynamics and electronics manufacturer SI2 Technologies.

Comcast spreads some Christmas cheer on behalf of digital equity

Christmas came early for many nonprofits when Comcast Corp. chief diversity officer Dalila Wilson-Scott crisscrossed the state last month giving out $600000 in grants to increase digital access and equity.

Wilson-Scott was in Boston in November distributing about $500000 to 17 organizations — including Tech Goes Home Central Boston Elder Services and One Bead. She also trekked to Springfield to deliver $100000 to the Western Massachusetts Alliance for Digital Equity.

Groups are using the money to help people access the Internet and acquire digital skills.

“People have been so focused on affordability but we’ve recognized for a long time adoption is a bigger barrier trust is a bigger barrier” said Wilson-Scott who also serves as the president of Comcast NBCUniversal Foundation.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of remote work telemedicine and education have highlighted the importance of online connectivity. Comcast’s grants are part of Project UP a 10-year $1 billion commitment the Philadelphia-based telecom giant has made to eliminate the digital divide.

“Most of us are connected every single day so we in some ways take it for granted” Wilson-Scott said. “You can’t really be on that path to economic mobility without being connected.”

While it is not uncommon for people to become CEOs due to nepotism at work the practice can raise ethical concerns and may be perceived as unfair by employees and stakeholders. In this article we will explore the phenomenon of nepotism in CEO appointments through case studies of four individuals who became CEOs due to their family connections: Lakshmi Mittal Mukesh Ambani Anne Wojcicki and Brian Roberts.

Ethical Concerns Surrounding Nepotism in CEO Appointments

Nepotism in the workplace can raise ethical concerns because it may result in people being chosen for positions of power or influence based on their family connections rather than their qualifications or merit. This can create an impression of favoritism and may undermine the perceived fairness and meritocracy of an organization. Additionally nepotism may exclude qualified candidates from being considered for leadership roles which can have negative consequences for the overall performance and success of the organization.

Case Study 1: Lakshmi Mittal CEO of ArcelorMittal

Lakshmi Mittal is the CEO of ArcelorMittal one of the world’s largest steel companies. Mittal’s father L.N. Mittal founded the company in 1976 and served as its CEO until 1995 when he handed over the reins to his son. Lakshmi Mittal has a bachelor’s degree in commerce from St. Xavier’s College in Kolkata and began his career in the steel industry in 1976 working for his father’s company. He eventually rose through the ranks to become CEO a position he has held since 1995.

The appointment of Lakshmi Mittal as CEO of ArcelorMittal may have been influenced by nepotism as he was given the opportunity to lead the company due to his family connections. However it is important to note that Mittal has a strong background in the steel industry and has demonstrated his abilities as a business leader during his tenure as CEO. The success of ArcelorMittal under Mittal’s leadership suggests that he is a qualified and capable CEO regardless of his family connections.

Case Study 2: Mukesh Ambani CEO of Reliance Industries

Mukesh Ambani is the CEO of Reliance Industries one of India’s largest companies. Ambani’s father Dhirubhai Ambani founded the company in 1966 and served as its chairman until his death in 2002. Mukesh Ambani joined the company in 1981 and worked his way up through the ranks eventually becoming CEO in 2002.

Ambani’s appointment as CEO of Reliance Industries may as well have been influenced by nepotism as he was given the opportunity to lead the company due to his family connections. However Ambani has a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering from the Institute of Chemical Technology in Mumbai and has a strong background in the energy and petrochemical industries. He has also demonstrated his abilities as a business leader during his tenure as CEO of Reliance Industries.

Case Study 3: Anne Wojcicki CEO of 23andMe

Anne Wojcicki is the CEO of 23andMe a personal genomics and biotechnology company. Wojcicki’s sister Susan Wojcicki is the CEO of YouTube and a co-founder of Google. Anne Wojcicki co-founded 23andMe in 2006 and has served as its CEO since then.

Wojcicki’s appointment as CEO of 23andMe may have been influenced by nepotism to some extent due to her family connections. However Wojcicki has a bachelor’s degree in biology from Yale University and has a strong background in the biotech industry. She has also demonstrated her leadership skills and business acumen as the CEO of 23andMe leading the company through several successful funding rounds and partnerships.

Case Study 4: Brian Roberts CEO of Comcast

Brian Roberts is the CEO of Comcast one of the largest media and telecommunications companies in the world. Roberts’s father Ralph Roberts founded the company in 1963 and served as its CEO until 2002 when he passed the position on to his son. Brian Roberts joined the company in 1981 and worked his way up through the ranks eventually becoming CEO in 2002.

Roberts’s appointment as CEO of Comcast may have been influenced by nepotism as he was given the opportunity to lead the company due to his family connections. However Roberts has a bachelor’s degree in economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and has a strong background in the media and telecommunications industries. He has also demonstrated his abilities as a business leader during his tenure as CEO of Comcast.

The Importance of Meritocracy and Fairness in CEO Appointments

The cases of Lakshmi Mittal Mukesh Ambani Anne Wojcicki and Brian Roberts demonstrate that people who become CEOs due to nepotism in the workplace are not necessarily unqualified or lacking in merit. However nepotism can raise concerns about fairness and meritocracy in the workplace and it is important for organizations to ensure that they are selecting the most qualified and capable individuals for leadership roles regardless of their family connections. Ensuring that CEO appointments are based on merit can help to foster trust and confidence in an organization and can ultimately contribute to its long-term success.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2RlYWxzLXJlY2Vzc2lvbi1ob2xseXdvb2Qtc2VsbGVycy0xMjM1Mjg2NTU0L9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2RlYWxzLXJlY2Vzc2lvbi1ob2xseXdvb2Qtc2VsbGVycy0xMjM1Mjg2NTU0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hollywood’s Deal Dilemma for 2023: Go Big or Wait Out the Downturn?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2RlYWxzLXJlY2Vzc2lvbi1ob2xseXdvb2Qtc2VsbGVycy0xMjM1Mjg2NTU0L9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2RlYWxzLXJlY2Vzc2lvbi1ob2xseXdvb2Qtc2VsbGVycy0xMjM1Mjg2NTU0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021227306950>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee recently implemented the seventh interest rate hike of the year a 0.5-point increase that came a day after data indicated that the Consumer Price Index eased a bit in November to a 7.1-percent annualized rate down from a prior 7.7 percent.

The latest FOMC increase followed four straight interest rate hikes of 0.75 points each.

Rising interest rates throughout the year have slowed the economy although a continued strong jobs market and consumer spending have generally led economists to forecast a mild recession in 2023 as opposed to a deeper downturn.

“It will be a modest recession” in the second half of 2023 Jeff Korzenik chief investment strategist for Fifth Third Bank said during this month’s annual economic outlook hosted by The Right Place Inc. in Grand Rapids.

“We will not have the big dislocation in the economy that you typically associate with a big recession” Korzenik said. “We simply have too much momentum in the labor market. We’re adding 200000 to 300000 jobs every month and it takes a longer period of erosion before you actually get into recession.”

Korzenik believes there remains a “very distinct possibility perhaps a 40 percent possibility that we get some kind of soft landing” for the U.S. economy and avoid recession he said.

“There is some cause to believe that inflation will break before the economy but it gets a lot stickier when you start to get into some of the details” he said.

For instance Korzenik cited expectations for transportation and housing costs to trend downward while new vehicle prices will continue to stay elevated. He’s also “really concerned” about wage inflation from an acute labor shortage as employers raise compensation well above recent norms to attract and retain workers.

Across the nation there are roughly 10 million open jobs with only 6 million people actively seeking employment. Wage inflation has been running at a nationwide average of about 5 percent more than twice the rate of productivity gains Korzenik said.

“That’s too high. That’s inconsistent with getting to the Fed’s goal of 2 percent inflation” he said. “If we go into a recession it will be because we can’t seem to get our hands around the labor issue. This labor issue is truly extraordinary.”

The University of Michigan’s Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics expects a “very mild recession” said Don Grimes a regional economic specialist. Grimes predicts the U.S. economy will ease into recession in the second half of 2023 with full-year Real GDP growth of 0.5 percent followed by 0.8 percent in 2024.

The new year will begin with 0.3-percent Real GDP growth in the first six months of 2023 according to the University of Michigan’s latest economic outlook. Real GDP then shrinks 0.8 percent for the second half of the year.

The U.S. should then return to 0.8-percent Real GDP growth for all of 2024 as the Federal Reserve eases monetary policy according to the University of Michigan outlook.

Outlooks that several economists submitted to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago project a median of 0.6-percent growth in Real GDP between the fourth quarter of 2022 and the fourth quarter of 2023.

“The big question for the coming year is will inflation come down as we’re all hoping it does so that the Fed won’t have to put the brakes harder on the economy” Thom Walstrom a senior business economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago said in a recent economic outlook symposium.

“The least rosy forecast according to our forecasters is for at most a mild recession” in 2023 Walstrom said. “The median forecast is for what I would call a ‘soft landing.’”

In an updated U.S. outlook issued last week Comerica Inc. economists predicted Real GDP would shrink 0.2 percent for 2023 then grow 1.3 percent in 2024. Comerica expects Real GDP to remain flat for the fourth quarter of 2022 then decline 1.8 percent and 1.4 percent in the first and second quarters of next year respectively. Real GDP growth should return in the third quarter and get to 1.8 percent a year from now according to the Comerica outlook.

As well Comerica expects that wage growth “will likely slow to a rate in line with the pre-pandemic trend” by the end of 2023. Comerica pegs the chance of a recession occurring by the end of next years as “a four in five proposition.”

Economic outlooks also predict that inflation and the CPI will moderate during 2023. The University of Michigan predicts core inflation will register 6.2 percent for 2022 and ease to 4.3 percent in 2023 and 2.5 percent in 2024.

An outlook the FOMC issued after last week’s latest interest rate hike projects that core inflation — which excludes volatile food and energy prices — could dip from an expected 4.5 percent this year to 3.5 percent in 2023.

Given the continued job growth the “tremendous strength” in the financial system consumer spending that remains solid and high savings rates the U.S. economy is “just not as exposed as you typically would be” from rising interest rates Korzenik said.

“We would argue that the economy has more resiliency than we normally would have and that gives us time” he said noting the question remains whether that resiliency will give the economy enough time to tackle inflation without falling into a recession.

“It’s a different kind of cycle (and) that gives you more resiliency” Korzenik said.

Wells Fargo also predicts that inflation should ease with a 4.1 percent Consumer Price Index in 2023 and 2.7 percent in 2024. The Producer Price Index estimated to finish 2022 at 9.9 percent will decline to 3.9 percent in 2023 and ease further in 2024 to 2.4 percent according to Wells Fargo.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago expects “a pretty substantial slowdown in inflation” Walstrom said. Economists who submitted outlooks to the Chicago Fed predicted a median 4.4 percent CPI.

“We need inflation to slow down or else the Fed is going to be forced to keep raising rates” Walstrom said. “If inflation doesn’t come in as expected it’s going to have to slow it further and that’s where this ‘harder landing’ is coming from in the forecast from folks.”

The FOMC throughout 2022 has been “on the warpath” against inflation and increased rates at “unprecedented speed” Korzenik said.

“Some of this is because the Fed fell behind in fighting inflation” he said.

In a statement following last week’s interest rate increase the FOMC said that “ongoing increases” in interest rates “will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.”

Comerica’s outlook expects the FOMC “will probably make two final rate hikes of a quarter percentage point each in early 2023” and tag inflation will “probably slow to under 5 percent by next spring.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

(Loren Holmes/ADN)

A major oil prospect on federal land in Alaska is hanging in the balance as pressure mounts on the Biden administration for a final decision to approve or reject the project.

Conservation groups and climate activists have urged the administration to deny ConocoPhillips the permission it needs to build the $8 billion Willow oil project. National groups protested outside the White House earlier this month arguing the project will imperil wildlife like polar bears and undermine President Joe Biden’s goals to combat climate change.

The project’s advocates including Alaska’s bipartisan congressional delegation are calling for approval from the administration so construction can start immediately during the North Slope’s short winter season or else it will be delayed until next year. They say the project is vital for the struggling Alaska economy and could combat future high oil and gas prices.

Alaska Native leaders are also weighing in both in favor and against.

Political observers say they don’t know where the Biden administration will land saying the president is in a tough political position.

ConocoPhillips has said it will begin construction as soon as the administration makes a decision supporting development.

“Any further delay (at Willow) is unwarranted” after five years of environmental review of the project the company said in a statement Thursday.

Additional delay “jeopardizes ConocoPhillips’ ability to initiate construction of the project in this winter season and further advance major contract awards that are needed to execute the project” the company said.

Also this month ConocoPhillips Alaska President Erec Isaacson signaled in an interview with Bloomberg that the company will back out of the project if the Biden administration scales the development down to two drilling locations called pads.

ConocoPhillips said the “viable path forward” is a development proposal with three initial drilling pads a plan the federal government proposed this summer. That plan arose after a federal judge rejected initial approval of the project by the Trump administration in 2020 after conservation groups argued that the government had underestimated the plan’s harm to wildlife among other factors.

Alaska delegation meets Biden officials

If built Willow would be one of the first oil fields in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. The reserve which is the largest block of federal land in the U.S. was established by President Warren Harding in 1923 as a source of oil for the U.S. Navy. But commercial oil didn’t flow from the reserve until ConocoPhillips established its first small field there in 2015.

The Willow field could produce 600 million barrels of oil over three decades worth $50 billion at today’s oil prices. Its oil could also lead to the release of 278 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions during that time equivalent to what 76 coal-fired power plants emit in a year conservation groups say.

ConocoPhillips called the power plant figure used by the conservation groups is “deliberately misleading” as it compares emissions over Willow’s 30-year life to the annual output of coal plants. The oil company said that based on new calculations in the draft environmental report released in July which presents the smaller proposal for three initial drilling pads ConocoPhillips found that Willow’s “annualized direct and net indirect emissions” are equal to about one of the “theoretical power plants.”

Alaska Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan and Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola said in a statement Wednesday that they’ve met twice with senior Biden administration officials in recent days to urge approval of the project. The meetings included John Podesta Biden’s senior adviser on clean energy innovation and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh Sullivan said in an interview.

The administration has committed to releasing a final environmental report for the project before February and a final decision before March according to the delegation’s statement.

In September the delegation had implored the administration to approve the project by year’s end.

Spokespeople with the Interior Department declined to comment on the current timeline for a decision.

“We have nothing to offer on this” said Melissa Schwartz communications director with the agency.

Sullivan said the timeline is “disappointing” and limits the development that could begin in the four-month construction season that begins in January. Work that can’t happen this year will need to wait until early next year.

“Even the news today was in my view somewhat disappointing because you’re getting into the middle of the construction season” Sullivan said Wednesday.

Climate activists protest Willow outside White House

Climate activists in early December protested at the Ellipse outside the White House unfurling a bright-yellow banner that said: “Stop the Willow Oil Project.”

“Our recent climate wins the clean energy advancements we’ve made President Biden’s 2030 goals — they’re all for nothing if the administration approves this colossal drilling project” said Magnolia Mead of This is Zero Hour. “Youth turned out to elect President Biden and Democrats because of their ambitious climate promises and all eyes are on him to follow through.”

Alaska Native leaders have also weighed in.

Rosemary Ahtuangaruak Nuiqsut’s mayor wrote in an opinion piece in The Hill last month that her village the closest to the project is being ignored as Biden “barrels towards approving” it.

“The Biden administration is moving forward with a massive oil and gas project that is a climate disaster waiting to happen while refusing to listen to the voices of my constituents and community who will bear the burden of this project with our health and our livelihoods” she wrote.

Harry Brower Jr. mayor of the North Slope Borough that includes Nuiqsut and borough president Amaulik Edwardsen expressed support for Willow in a September opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal.

“We are tired of outside groups trying to turn this project and every other oil and gas project in our region into the poster child for a global movement away from fossil fuels” they wrote. “This is more than a political oil debate for us; it’s about access to land we were promised many years ago. Without projects like Willow and their crucial economic benefits many of my neighbors would be forced to leave the lands they and their ancestors have inhabited for thousands of years.”

‘A tough spot’ for Biden

Observers of oil field activity and federal policy in Alaska said they weren’t sure where the Biden administration would land on Willow.

Andy Mack former Alaska Department of Natural Resources commissioner under independent Gov. Bill Walker noted the Biden administration has taken positions that have allowed the Willow project to advance.

The Bureau of Land Management and ConocoPhillips have worked together to find a way to reduce harm to the environment that would have been caused by an original development plan proposed by the oil company he said.

“I think they’ve done as much as they can do to mitigate the impacts” through the project’s design said Mack chief executive of Kuukpik the Alaska Native village corporation for Nuiqsut and an oil field services provider.

Mack said Willow is an “economic opportunity” for Alaska. But it is “immense” and will have environmental impacts he said. Kuukpik will push for improvements like urging the federal government to require electronic monitoring of caribou in the area to provide details on their status he said.

Pat Pourchot the former top Interior official in Alaska for six years under President Barack Obama said in an interview he thinks Biden is “under a lot of pressure” on Willow.

Biden has set ambitious goals to reduce carbon emissions but the Willow project will increase those emissions he said.

That creates a contradiction in policy something emphasized by conservation groups said Pourchot board president for the Alaska Wilderness League which was part of the legal effort that stopped Willow’s approval under the Trump administration.

Pourchot said the administration also has political calculations to consider in a Willow decision.

That includes future support that might be needed from Murkowski a moderate who at times has been a critical swing vote on issues that Democrats favor.

And Democratic leadership will want to support Peltola politically who they’ll need in two years to regain control of the House he said.

“The Biden administration is in the crosshairs between his own policies and on the political side” Pourchot said. “I think Biden is in a tough spot and I don’t know what he’ll do on Willow.”

Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly reported how many barrels of oil the Willow field could produce over 30 years. The correct amount is 600 million not 600 billion. This article has also been updated to include a response from ConocoPhillips about emissions at Willow.

makes strides in global LNG industry's largest project at North Field in 2022| Gulf Times,QatarEnergy made significant strides in realising the North Field Expansion by choosing partners this year for both North Field South (NFS) and North Field East (NFE) expansion which is the global industry’s largest ever LNG project.This unique project is characterised by the highest health safety and environmental standards including carbon capture and sequestration to reduce the project’s overall carbon footprint to the lowest levels possible.The North Field expansion plan includes six LNG trains that will ramp up Qatar’s liquefaction capacity from 77 mtpy per year to 126 mtpy by 2027.Four trains will be part of the North Field East and two trains will be part of North Field South project.In January this year QatarEnergy announced the awarding of a major Engineering Procurement Construction and Installation (EPCI) Contract for the offshore scope of its North Field Expansion Project to McDermott Middle East Inc.The scope for the awarded contract includes some 13 normally unmanned wellhead platforms topsides (eight for NFE and five for NFS) in addition to various connecting pipelines and the shore approaches for the NFE pipelines beach valve stations and buildings.In March His Highness the Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani inaugurated the Barzan Gas Plant at a special ceremony held at Ras Laffan Industrial City.The Barzan Gas Plant will produce and process natural gas from the North Field to serve the requirements of local power generation and water desalinisation.It will also produce associated hydrocarbon products for supply to local refinery and petrochemical industries as well as for export to international markets.In the same month QatarEnergy’s updated Sustainability Strategy set aggressive targets by capturing in excess of 11mn tonnes of CO2 annually in the country by 2035.QatarEnergy’s Sustainability Strategy outlines multiple initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions including flagship projects such as the further deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology.These projects will further reduce the carbon intensity of Qatar’s LNG facilities by 35% and of its upstream facilities by at least 25% (compared to previous targets of 25% and 15% respectively) bolstering Qatar’s commitment to responsibly supply cleaner LNG at scale in support of the energy transition.In April Industries Qatar (IQ) and Mesaieed Petrochemical Holding (MPHC) gave their approval to Qatar Vinyl Company (QVC) for a new PVC (polyvinyl chloride) project with 350000 tonnes per annum capacity at an estimated cost of $239mn.In the same month QatarEnergy signed a series of time-charter parties (TCPs) with a subsidiary of Mitsui O.S.K Lines (MOL) for the long-term charter and operation of four LNG ships constituting the first batch of TCPs awarded under QatarEnergy’s massive LNG shipping programme.In April a joint venture between Técnicas Reunidas SA (TR) and Wison Engineering (Wison) was also selected as the EPC contractor and awarded a lump-sum contract by QatarEnergy for the expansion of the sulfur handling storage and loading facilities within Ras Laffan Industrial City.In June and July the $29bn North Field East (NFE) expansion the single largest project in the history of global LNG industry saw QatarEnergy joining hands with five global energy companies – TotalEnergies Shell ExxonMobil Eni and ConocoPhillips.The five partners of QatarEnergy in the prestigious project were chosen through a competitive process that started in 2019 which will expand Qatar’s LNG export capacity from the current 77mn tonnes per year (mtpy) to 110 mtpy by 2026.While it was Eni’s first entry ever into Qatar’s upstream sector the four other global energy companies - TotalEnergies ExxonMobil Shell and ConocoPhillips - have been QatarEnergy’s partners in the energy industry for many years.The multi-billion dollar North Field Expansion the largest LNG development in global history will generate substantial revenues for Qatar and hugely contribute to the country’s GDP noted HE the Minister of State for Energy Affairs Saad bin Sherida al-Kaabi.The North Field expansion comprising North Field East (NFE) and North Field South (NFS) will provide significant benefits for all sectors of the Qatari economy during the construction phase and beyond al-Kaabi said in reply to a question by Gulf Times at a media event at QatarEnergy headquarters in June.In July Dolphin Energy marked 15 years of operations after recording the first gas flow from Qatar to the UAE on July 10 2007.Dolphin Energy’s major strategic initiative the Dolphin Gas Project involves the production and processing of natural gas from Qatar’s North Field and transportation of the dry gas by sub-sea export pipeline from Qatar to the UAE which began in July 2007.In August QatarEnergy awarded the engineering procurement and construction (EPC) contract to Samsung C&T for its QR2.3bn industrial cities solar power project (IC Solar).This project includes two large scale photovoltaic (PV) solar power plants to be built in Mesaieed Industrial City (MIC) and Ras Laffan Industrial City (RLIC) and is expected to start electricity production by the end of 2024.In September QatarEnergy announced that it selected TotalEnergies as the first international partner in the multi-billion dollar North Field South (NFS) expansion project.In the same month QatarEnergy signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with General Electric (GE) to collaborate on developing a carbon capture roadmap for the energy sector in Qatar.In October QatarEnergy chose Shell as its second international partner in the North Field South (NFS) expansion project.In October HE the Minister of State for Energy Affairs Saad bin Sherida al-Kaabi also the President and CEO of QatarEnergy received the 2022 ‘Energy Executive of the Year’ award which was presented to him by Energy Intelligence in London.In October QatarEnergy announced an oil discovery in the 4-BRSA-1386D-RJS well in Brazil's world class Sepia oil field which is located in the prolific Santos Basin in water depths of about 2000 meters off the coast of Rio de Janeiro.In October Qatar’s first and one the region’s largest solar plants was inaugurated by His Highness the Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani at Al Kharsaah.The multi-billion dollar 800MW Al Kharsaah Solar PV Power Plant (KSPP) was constructed on a 10sq km land area and can provide the national grid with about 10% of peak electricity demand.In the same month QatarEnergy announced the signing of a share sale and purchase agreement with Qatar Electricity and Water Company (QEWC) to acquire QEWC’s 49% interest in Siraj Energy which would result in Siraj Energy becoming a wholly-owned affiliate of QatarEnergy subject to customary approvals.October also saw QatarEnergy selecting ConocoPhillips as its third and final international partner in the North Field South (NFS) expansion project which comprises two LNG mega trains with a combined capacity of 16 mtpy.In October His Highness the Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani issued Amiri Decision No 48 of 2022 on restructuring the QatarEnergy Board of Directors.The decision stipulated that the QatarEnergy Board of Directors would be reconstituted with His Highness the Deputy Amir Sheikh Abdullah bin Hamad al-Thani as Chairman.In October Affiliates of QatarEnergy and ExxonMobil have agreed to independently

BUFFALO — In Buffalo one of the snowiest cities in the country residents pride themselves on weathering extreme winter conditions. But the city and region were left reeling from a fierce and sprawling storm that pummeled parts of the country last week and devastated Western New York where hundreds were stranded in their cars and stuck in homes encased in six-foot drifts on Saturday.

At least three people died in Erie County two of them because emergency responders could not get there fast enough; whiteout conditions left roads so choked with snow that sometimes even snowplows could not clear them.

“This may turn out to be the worst storm in our community’s history surpassing the famed Blizzard of ’77 for its ferocity” Mark Poloncarz the Erie County executive said on Saturday.

Emergency workers who had already performed dozens of rescues Friday and early Saturday were still retrieving people from cars as darkness fell. Some residents prepared to spend another night at home without power with no safe way to reach shelter elsewhere.

In one case a doctor had to talk a woman through her labor on the phone giving instructions to her sister on how to deliver the baby.

Almost 28000 customers in the Buffalo area remained without electricity as of 4 a.m. Sunday according to the website poweroutage.us which collects information on power outages. Utility crews had been expected to fix some power substations by Saturday night but Mr. Poloncarz cautioned that some may not be restored until late Monday. Officials said blizzard conditions were likely to persist overnight before beginning to subside Sunday morning. Forecasters said they expected very low temperatures — as much as 15 to 25 degrees below average — across the eastern United States on Christmas Day.

The storm’s unusual duration fueled its devastating impact as it struck highly populated areas and raged all day on Friday and all day Saturday. Howling winds drove mounds of snow more than six feet high burying front porches and parked vehicles. In the hardest-hit areas — including Buffalo Cheektowaga Lancaster and Williamsville — two-thirds of emergency responders became stuck themselves and were unable to reach people Mr. Poloncarz said.

County officials urged people to stay put even without heat or power and asked the National Guard to assist with rescue operations. Buffalo-Niagara International Airport is closed until Monday said Kathy Hochul the governor of New York.

As the cold deepened and urgency grew emergency workers resorted to using snow plows to transport some residents to shelters Ms. Hochul said.

“Everyone is like ‘Oh you’re from Buffalo you’re used to this’” said Tommy Bellonte 37 who briefly emerged from his Buffalo home Saturday morning to check on a neighbor. “But you can’t get used to this.”

Americans in dozens of states on Saturday faced the frigid aftermath of the powerful four-day storm that knocked out power to 1.5 million homes and businesses at its peak. The potent weather system a “bomb cyclone” packing high winds intensified by a collision of air masses upended travel plans for tens of thousands forcing many to spend Christmas without heat electricity or the company of family members.

Temperatures plunged into the single digits in central southern and eastern states as the huge weather system swept north into Canada and frigid Arctic air settled in behind it. The cold set records for Christmas Eve in some places across the country including in Baltimore where the temperature plummeted to 8 degrees and in Bluefield W.Va. where it bottomed out at minus 9.

On Saturday the fourth day of the storm millions remained under winter storm or blizzard warnings. Half a million homes and businesses were still in the dark up and down the East Coast at midday Saturday according to poweroutage.us; by day’s end the total had declined to 320000. Maine was the hardest hit with 162000 customers without service.

Some residents of beachfront areas in New York City also faced the prospect of leaving home for Christmas after Friday’s storm surge caused heavy flooding in the Rockaways swamping basement apartments said Donovan Richards Jr. the Queens borough president.

At least 17 deaths were attributed to the storm including a dozen in traffic accidents across four states. In Castleton Vt. a 51-year-old woman was killed by a falling tree local police confirmed. In the Chicago area a 54-year-old man died of hypothermia a spokeswoman for the Cook County medical examiner said. In Houston a homeless person died trying to set up a fire to keep warm according to the mayor Sylvester Turner.

As the cold tightened its grip cities and towns opened warming shelters in fire stations and school gymnasiums and residents sought shelter some after spending Friday night in unheated homes huddled under blankets and clustered around fireplaces in the dark.

After a day without power Shantel Moncrief and her husband tried to sleep in their apartment in south Nashville on Friday night layered in sweaters and blankets. Too cold to rest they moved into their car at 2 a.m. and at 6 a.m. relocated to her mother’s house.

“We were bundled up” Ms. Moncrief 24 said. “It just wasn’t enough.”

Nearly 8000 U.S. flights were disrupted on Saturday because of the storm according to FlightAware a website that tracks flight data. And many with plans to travel by car were thwarted by icy roads highway closures and travel bans.

At La Guardia Airport in New York more than 50 flights were canceled Saturday morning and travelers prepared to spend Christmas Eve at the airport or in nearby hotels.

Misty and Dan Ellis arrived at the airport for check-in at 3 a.m. with their teenage children. Hours later their flight was canceled and each member of the family was rebooked on a different flight said Mr. Ellis.

The family decided to rent a car instead and drive 14 hours to their home in Nashville. The cost would be hefty Mr. Ellis said but he did not mind paying it.

“We’ll be home together” he said “for Christmas.”

As darkness fell in Western New York on Saturday and temperatures crept even lower thousands of utility workers and plow drivers faced another long night of work to restore power and clear roads. With snow forecast to continue and travel bans still in effect stores were empty of last-minute shoppers and streets mostly silent.

For those still out in the perilous conditions home seemed a world away however close.

Frank Anderson 50 was stuck in deep snow in his large white pickup truck on Saturday for the second time since wrapping up his shift as a prison guard.

Still wearing his work jacket with a New York State Corrections and Community Supervision emblem on his left sleeve and with only a spare sweater in the back seat he found his truck jammed along Hertel Avenue his tires spinning on ice as he tried to make it back to his wife and three children in time for Christmas. He was about “a mile from home” in the suburb of Tonawanda.

“I’m going to miss Christmas with my people” he said the truck and heat still running as he sat inside in the middle of the unplowed road packed with feet of snow.

“I am not going to walk home” he added. “If I have to sleep here I’ll be all right.”

“It was like a waterfall coming down the steps. I had to put a towel down so it wouldn’t come in my apartment” Lincoln Houses resident Chante Hill said of the “dirty water” that seeped into her own and neighbors’ homes after the pump burst sometime Christmas Eve.



The misery was felt elsewhere as well for tenants in some New York City Housing Authority-run buildings.



According to the city as of Monday 3000 people at Astoria Houses were without heat or hot water after both were knocked out at midnight — and another 3000 were without heat at Vladeck Houses in Manhattan.



For Hill the flooding at the Lincoln Houses was only the beginning of a frigid Christmas weekend upending holiday plans delaying deliveries and leaving her and neighbors shivering under several blankets.

“I don’t got no heat. I got walls leaking and everything” complained Hill’s husband Jeffery Childs. “I just worked a double last night. You think I don’t want to take a shower? I don’t want to get under four five blankets.”

Elizabeth Hernandez 36 who lives at Lincoln Houses on the floor closest to the leak said the incident initially trapped her there with her sister and three teenage kids.

“I have no heat. We couldn’t leave” Hernandez said. “My food delivery was canceled because they couldn’t come upstairs.”

The water Saturday filled the hallways and poured down the building’s stairs Hernandez recalled — trapping residents inside. The heat had yet to return Monday.

“It was like balls of water dripping all over. It was dirty brownish water” she said. “It was scary as hell. We didn’t know what to do because they didn’t tell us nothing.”

Another 50-year-old resident said the dirty water made it all the way down to her first-floor apartment and into the building’s lobby.

“All of the water started rushing into my house” the woman who gave her name as Miss Miller told The Post. “My sons and two neighbors started sweeping the water in the shaft. It was like a river out here.”

The Fire Department arrived soon enough but NYCHA officials were missing in action Miller said.

“Housing never said anything to us. They just came and was mopping” she said.

A broken window in the building’s lobby meant cold air seeped into the building creating a potential ice hazard amid sub-freezing temperatures she added.

“Someone broke the window out and it was brick cold” Miller said.

A spokeswoman for NYCHA said outages at the Lincoln Houses could have resulted from “high winds” Friday night causing water to spill from roof tank — but that “two mobile boilers on site are functional and …the buildings have heat water and hot water.”

She said a heat and hot water outage at Astoria Houses was “due to low oil in the boiler plant” — and that a secondary tank was used while repairs were done. She said heat and hot water service were “fully restored.”



The spokeswoman said “transformer failure” affected boilers at Vladeck Houses I and II and added “Con Edison made the repairs and the boilers were in service but additional repairs were needed.” She estimated full restoration by Monday evening.

Utilities have been one of the hottest topics of 2022 as the Russian invasion of Ukraine ushered in a wave of inflation especially in Europe. In fact in the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) energy inflation stood at 28.1% on average. The bulk of this inflation was contributed by 13 countries all of which saw energy inflation soar above a painful 30%. The largest inflation was in Italy where energy prices soared by a whopping 71% annually in October.

The U.S on the other hand saw relatively 'muted' energy inflation that stood at just 17.3% in the same month. This was the third lowest among all G7 economies and the primary reason that Americans remained better off was that they do not rely on Russian energy imports. However this does not mean that prices are low as natural gas and coal shortages have nevertheless pushed up retail utility prices to five year highs especially as record natural gas prices ended up driving the cost of producing electricity. For America these price increases are unavoidable since the largest portion (35.4%) of electricity is generated via natural gas. The price volatility itself has expedited the shift to renewable energy among utilities according to the IEA.

However these prices which end up in massive profits for power producers do have a silver lining. According to Bloomberg these companies are selling excess capacity at lower prices - rates that coal and gas producers cannot match. This according to analysts can end up putting the coal companies out of business and reducing emissions in the long term. The latest in the U.S. energy and utility sector these days is Winter Storm Elliott which has disrupted oil and gas output - which in turn has led to higher prices and power blackouts all over the country. U.S. benchmark oil prices jumped to $79.56 a barrel while power prices soared to $3700 per megawatt hour. Some oil companies that suffered from the reduced output are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC).

Today we will look at which companies are the largest when it comes to providing electricity and gas to Americans. Some largest U.S. utilities are Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO).

ESO 415-19 is a peculiar spiral galaxy approximately 450 million light-years from Earth.

Also known as LEDA 8936 or IRAS F02188-3210 it is found in the southern constellation of Fornax.

ESO 415-19 has a bright core with patches of dark dust and fuzzier dimmer spiral arms in cooler colors with spots of bright blue.

Long faint tidal streams stretch from the galaxy’s arms: one up to the top of the frame one curving down to the bottom-left corner.

“While the center of this object resembles a regular spiral galaxy long streams of stars stretch out from the galactic core like bizarrely elongated spiral arms” Hubble astronomers said in a statement.

“These are tidal streams caused by some chance interaction in the galaxy’s past and give ESO 415-19 a distinctly peculiar appearance.”

“ESO 415-19’s peculiarity made it a great target for Hubble” they added.

“This observation comes from an ongoing campaign to explore the Arp Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies a menagerie of some of the weirdest and most wonderful galaxies that the Universe has to offer.”

“These galaxies range from bizarre lonesome galaxies to spectacularly interacting galaxy pairs triplets and even quintets.”

“These space oddities are spread throughout the night sky which means that Hubble can spare a moment to observe them as it moves between other observational targets.”

“This particular observation lies in a part of the night sky contained by the Fornax constellation” the astronomers said.

“This constellation was also the site of a particularly important Hubble observation: the Hubble Ultra Deep Field.”

“Creating the Ultra Deep Field required almost a million seconds of Hubble time and captured nearly 10000 galaxies of various ages sizes shapes and colors.”

“Just as climate scientists can recreate the planet’s atmospheric history from ice cores astronomers can use deep field observations to explore slices of the Universe’s history from the present all the way to when the Universe was only 800 million years old.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZW1vbmRlLmZyL2VuL2Vjb25vbXkvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIyLzEyLzI2L2Vsb24tbXVzay1zLXN0YXJsaW5rLWFuZC10aGUtYmF0dGxlLW9mLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1jb25zdGVsbGF0aW9uc182MDA5MTIwXzE5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon Musk's Starlink and the battle of satellite constellations,"In Depth'Race to the stars' (1/4). The war in Ukraine has revealed the importance of broadcasting high-speed internet through space when terrestrial infrastructure is destroyed or non-existent. In this emerging market a host of projects including those by Amazon and Eutelsat are competing with Mr. Musk's satellites.

Starlink OneWeb Kuiper and now Iris². Until recently the competition between these different satellite networks to provide high-speed internet throughout the world was carried out in an atmosphere of general indifference. Only the professionals involved or space enthusiasts were interested in it.

The war in Ukraine however has brought their strategic importance to light as the country's military was able to restore its internet and phone links thanks to Elon Musk's Starlink constellation. As soon as the conflict began on February 24 with terrestrial telecommunications infrastructure partially destroyed by the Russians the billionaire made his 3200 satellites available to Kyiv. This allowed the army to better organize itself to launch counter-offensives. After the success of this initiative the libertarian entrepreneur now imagines himself influencing the peace process.

Suddenly what was science fiction – a private investor coming to the aid of a government with his space equipment – has become reality. Questions have been raised as a result about the danger of this power being concentrated in the hands of a single person pushing governments to react in order to preserve their sovereignty – which is what Europe is doing today with its Iris² project as well as Canada with its Lightspeed constellation.

It all started about 15 years ago when three American billionaires – Greg Wyler the pioneer Elon Musk the disruptor and Jeff Bezos the outsider – began to set their sights on space. In 2007 aware that terrestrial infrastructure would not allow the entire world population to be connected Mr. Wyler conceived O3b short for ""Other 3 Billion"" a satellite network intended to connect the 3 billion Internet users on the planet who did not have access to it. Very quickly due to a lack of resources he sold his company to the Luxembourg operator SES.

Seven years later in 2014 not giving up on his idea Mr. Wyler proposed to Mr. Musk that he participate in the creation of OneWeb a network of 500 satellites covering the entire globe 1200 kilometers from Earth. The orbit would be much closer than that of the O3b satellites (8000 kilometers) with the idea of reducing the latency time as much as possible to approach the speed of terrestrial networks. Low latency is essential for the real-time operation of cars and connected devices as well as for financial transactions and air transport not to mention video games.

Different marketing stances

Mr. Musk still working on his plans to go to Mars and above all win the space race with SpaceX turned down Mr. Wyler's offer. With his low-cost reusable Falcon 9 rockets the electric car pioneer and head of Tesla also established himself as a major player in the space world dictating his own rules and breaking the European-Russian Ariane-Proton duopoly.

Keep staring you'll quickly learn that our Universe can be so much stranger and more wondrous than anything the human mind can dream of.

A recent image released by the European Southern Observatory (ESO) has captured just a small glimpse of that on a cosmic scale: a dark nebula 7 light-years long looking like a titanic lighthouse keeping watch over the cold black void of space. Perhaps it's a cyclopean giant seeking planets to devour. Or death itself haunting the heavens cloaked in shadow.

Far from a destroyer of worlds this darkness represents something far more fertile.

The new image comes from ESO's Very Large Telescope to celebrate the observatory's 60th anniversary. The image's eerie subject is the Cone Nebula part of a larger complex 2500 light-years away called NGC 2264 in the constellation Monoceros (the Unicorn).

It might not look like most other nebulae you're accustomed to seeing glowing brightly with a complex array of colors. That's because not all nebulae are the same. Some reflect the light of nearby stars. Some ionized by the stars within them emit their own light.

And some like the Cone Nebula are dark thick with dust that absorbs visible light. Only light at wavelengths invisible to the human eye such as infrared and radio can penetrate them.

Opaque nebulae of this type are known as molecular clouds. These include some of the most interesting nebulae to be found: places where baby stars are born. The dust is an efficient emitter of infrared light which carries away thermal energy and causes the cloud to cool. Without the outward pressure supplied by heat gravity overwhelms the clumps of the dust and gas and forces them together.

It's these dense clumps form the seeds of stars; spinning they draw in even more mass from the surrounding cloud providing the growing protostar with the pressure needed to kick-start fusion in its core.

At a certain mass the star produces what astronomers call feedback. Jets of plasma accelerated by the star's magnetic field lines erupt from its poles and powerful radiation pressure generated by the star's ultraviolet light. Both contribute the a stellar wind that pushes away material from the baby star.

This is what gives the Cone Nebula its iconic shape. Baby stars burning blue and hot (although appearing gold in color in the new image) are at the stage of their life where their feedback is blasting away at the dusty nebula. Similar processes carved out the famous Pillars of Creation structures within the Eagle Nebula.

Because infrared light can penetrate these dense clouds instruments that can see the Universe in infrared light – such as the James Webb Space Telescope – are invaluable for revealing the particulars of the star formation processes that take place therein.

But visible light images like the VLT's show details that disappear in other wavelengths. It's only by studying the full spectrum that we can obtain a comprehensive understanding of everything at play in these enigmatic fascinating structures.

In this article I’ll be going over everything you need to know about Arataki Itto including their playstyle best artifacts weapons teams and more.

Arataki Itto is a limited 5 star Geo claymore user who boasts respectable damage within his teams despite having access to no reactions along with a fairly straightforward playstyle that extracts value at a low barrier of entry.

Active Talents

Normal Attack – Fight Club Legend

Performs 4 strikes with unique properties behind his combos/scalings. Apart from his Standard Normal Attacks Itto has a special charged attack that allows him to perform consecutive slashes [Arataki Kesagiri] without consuming stamina provided Itto consumes a stack of Superlative Superstrength. An important thing to note is that when performing Itto’s Normal Attack combo dodging or using his Elemental Skill does NOT reset his combo which is a nice addition to his combo execution.

Superlative Superstength: Stacks which are unique to Itto that contribute to performing his Normal Attack combos. When a 2nd hit of your string hits opponents Itto will gain 1 stack of Superlative Superstrength and then 2 stacks on the 4th hit. Stack management is very relevant when it comes to Itto’s DMG output and will be covered in the Combos section.

Elemental Skill – Masatsu Zetsugi: Akaushi Burst!

Throws a bull called Ushi in front of him dealing Geo DMG on hit as well as giving Itto 1 stack of Superlative Superstrength. On-field Ushi taunts nearby enemies and will give Itto an additional stack of SS when Ushi takes DMG. This skill can be pressed or held with Ushi also being considered a Geo construct.

Elemental Burst – Royal Descent: Behold Itto the Evil!

The talent that enables Itto to function as a Geo carry. Upon cast Itto enters a state that converts his Normal/Charge Attacks to Geo DMG that cannot be overridden. Additionally his Normal Attack SPD is increased and gains an ATK Bonus based on his DEF.

Character Talent Priority

Here’s a quick talent priority for Arataki Itto.

Normal Attack > Elemental Burst > Elemental Skill

Simply put the multipliers on his combo slashes/finishers scale with his Normal Attack talent NOT his burst. Burst talent levels only affect the DEF to ATK conversion. Given that the majority of Itto’s DMG contribution is with his combos his Normal Attacks should not be neglected whatsoever.

Character Best Combos

Itto combos while in his burst state are quite varied. On one hand you can choose to prestack his Superlative Superstrength stacks in order to maximize his DMG or you can simply opt not to for ease of performance. On top of Itto’s initial rotation there are also combos to incorporate from the second rotation onwards in which you are able to get 1-2 prestacks for his maximum DMG with the tradeoff being harder to pull off. That being said here are combos for each level of prestacks [0-2].

Notation:

E – Skill

Q – Burst

N – Normal Attack

# – Number of Attacks

C – Charge Attack/ Combo Slash

F – Finisher / Final Slash

Standard Combo 0 prestacks [any rotation/easiest]:

Itto Q N1 E N2 C3F N4 C4F E F

1 prestack Combo [1st/2nd rotation onwards]:

Itto N1Q N1 E C4F N4 C4F E F

2 prestack Combo [only possible from 2nd rotation onwards/hardest]:

Itto N1Q N1 E C3F N3 E C3F

These combos are by no means the end-all be-all and you can even improvise depending on the situation. Maybe Ushi gets hit a couple of times or you preemptively consume stacks whatever the case may be. The main takeaway from his combos are prioritizing Kesagiri slash execution before performing finishers and getting 2 E casts per burst.

Passive Talents

Ascension Stat

As you ascend Arataki Itto he will gain Crit Rate.

1st Ascension

Arataki Ichiban: When Arataki Itto uses consecutive Arataki Kesagiri he obtains the following effects:

Each slash increases the ATK SPD of the next slash by 10%. Max ATK SPD increase is 30%.

Increases his resistance to interruption.

These effects will be cleared once he stops performing consecutive slashes.

A nice addition to Itto’s playstyle giving him ATK SPD with each consecutive Kesagiri Slash along with resistance to interruption which ensures his DMG output. Note that In order to maximize the ATK SPD buff you must have max Superlative Superstrength stacks before performing your Kesagiri slashes.

4th Ascension

Bloodline of the Crimson Oni: Arataki Kesagiri DMG is increased by 35% of Arataki Itto’s DEF.

Straightforward DMG increase towards Itto’s Charged Slashes further incentivizing DEF stats on him.

Utility Passive

Woodchuck Chucked: When a party member uses attacks to obtain wood from a tree they have a 25% chance to obtain an additional log of wood.

Constellations

As always for constellations every 5 star unit is completely functional at c0. Constellations in general and what they offer are far from needed. Itto’s constellations – along with other 5 stars – usually translate to unnecessary increases in damage/ clear time or quality of life aspects.

Do keep in mind constellation value takes into account the value you lose going for another copy of the character rather than a completely different character that could impact your account far more than a constellation would.

C1: Low/ Medium Impact

C2: Low Impact

C3: Low Impact

C4: Low/ Medium Impact

C5: Low/ Medium Impact

C6: Medium Impact

Constellation 1: Stay a While and Listen Up

After using Royal Descent: Behold Itto the Evil! Arataki Itto gains 2 stacks of Superlative Superstrength. After 1s Itto will gain 1 stack of Superlative Superstrength every 0.5s for 1.5s.

Essentially this constellation allows for more combo slashes earlier in your combo due to the stacks you gain. Depending on the buffs available in your team Itto’s slashes can take advantage of buffs that would usually run out by the time he gets to his combo slashes. Not a major constellation but not particularly bad either.

Constellation 2: Gather ‘Round It’s a Brawl!

After using Royal Descent: Behold Itto the Evil! each party member whose Element is Geo will decrease that skill’s CD by 1.5s and restore 6 Energy to Arataki Itto.

CD can be decreased by up to 4.5s in this manner. Max 18 Energy can be restored in this manner.

A quality of life constellation overall with the most relevant part being the Energy restoration which can lower ER requirements. The Burst CD decrease is pretty irrelevant due to his CD already lining up within his rotations anyways.

Constellation 3: Horns Lowered Coming Through

Increases the Level of Masatsu Zetsugi: Akaushi Burst! by 3.

Maximum upgrade level is 15.

A straightforward increase to his Elemental Skill DMG. Nothing much to be said here as Ushi’s damage isn’t a large portion of Itto’s DMG compared to his combos.

Constellation 4: Jailhouse Bread and Butter

When the Raging Oni King state caused by Royal Descent: Behold Itto the Evil! ends all nearby party members gain 20% DEF and 20% ATK for 10s.

While it provides a decent team wide buff it’s important to note that this constellation is only relevant after your initial rotation meaning that if you’re already one rotating content this constellation loses value. That being said it is a very relevant buff that Itto and his teammates generally appreciate.

Constellation 5: 10 Years of Hanamizaka Fame

Increases the Level of Royal Descent: Behold Itto the Evil! by 3.

Maximum upgrade level is 15.

An increase to Itto’s Elemental Burst talent level which only affects the ATK bonus he gets. A sizable increase to his damage but straightforward nonetheless.

Constellation 6: Arataki Itto Present!

Arataki Itto’s Charged Attacks deal +70% Crit DMG. Additionally when he uses Arataki Kesagiri he has a 50% chance to not consume stacks of Superlative Superstrength.

A strong constellation overall however it’s largely RNG dependent. The +70% Crit DMG yo Itto’s Charged Attacks are nice however the 50/50 chance to not consume his stacks are solely random and unreliable making this constellation tricky to value. On one hand it can be a significant damage increase on the other hand quite literally nothing changes. Overall a significant increase in DMG with optimistic assumptions but there are glaring caveats.

Playstyle

Arataki Itto has a very straightforward playstyle while having a layer of depth to his kit regarding his combos [see combo section]. Overall once his combos are comfortable to execute his rotations don’t change much as long as he is played with Gorou.

While he is limited within his team archetypes [basically only mono Geo] the units within that team can be quite flexible in terms of slots [besides Gorou ALWAYS play Gorou please]. Itto teams typically don’t require units that are highly valued in other comps as well making his teams a fine 2nd half team should you have access to it.

Artifacts

Husk of Opulent Dreams

Easily Itto’s best-in-slot artifact set. Simply put this set gives Itto the most beneficial stats along with a passive that he can easily stack due to his field time. Every other set falls off significantly compared to this set with most of them not even being resin efficient over the husk domain.

Main Stats

Circlet: Crit Rate/DMG

Sands: DEF%

Goblet: Geo DMG

Sub Stats

Here’s the order of sub stats to prioritize:

Energy Recharge [until requirement] = Crit Rate/DMG DEF%

Energy Recharge: 130-140%

Weapons

5-Star Weapons

These are the best 5-star weapons for Itto. Other 5-star options are usable but these are the only ones that are recommended for him.

Redhorn Stonethresher

Itto’s signature weapon. This has a huge crit damage value and a passive that is perfectly suited to Itto’s kit. Definitely use this on Itto if you have it as it is undoubtedly his best weapon.

4-Star Weapons

Serpent Spine

A strong weapon for Itto and his second best weapon at R1 while being close to R1 Redhorn at R5. Not only does it offer a Crit Rate substat the passive is fairly easy to fully stack in context of the Spiral Abyss.

As long as Itto is in your 1st slot you are actually able to fully stack Serpent Spine before you start a chamber [see the stack indicators around your character]. That being said it is generally recommended to have a shielder with this weapon regardless in order to maintain the stacks.

Whiteblind

Itto’s go-to F2P option and his baseline weapon. The DEF substat is appreciable on Itto with the passive being much more relevant after your initial rotation.

This is because Itto’s Elemental Burst snapshots his DEF meaning the subsequent stacks from this weapon post burst will not be converted during your 1st rotation.

That being said prestack combos do allow for a prestack on this weapon as well. Overall still a viable baseline weapon being better or comparable at high refinements to other 5 stars such as Wolf’s Gravestone and The Unforged.

No real reason to stray away from this weapon when it is free given that you don’t have Serpent Spine/ Redhorn.

Teams

Mono Geo

Itto’s go-to team composition which is usually composed of at least 3 Geo characters and a flex slot. Besides Itto a mandatory character that occupies a Geo slot on this team would have to be Gorou for how he greatly buffs Itto along with other Geo characters on the team that would appreciate his buff as well [Albedo].

Your optimal 3rd Geo slot would be Albedo for the off-field damage he provides and the difference he makes towards your team DMG compared to when you don’t have him. Otherwise Zhongli or Ningguang do just fine both being objectively weaker but having supporting capabilities within their kit that synergize with this team.

The options for your flex slot are as flexible as your roster allows it to be contextual to the content you are facing. It could be a fourth Geo character [not recommended in Abyss floors that require shield-breakers] or some sort of buffing/off-field character like Bennett Mona Fischl etc. Usually you can draft your flex slot after drafting your first team then assess the options you have available.

Example Rotation [Itto Gorou Albedo Mona]:

Notation:

E – Skill

Q – Burst

N – Normal Attack

# – Number of Attacks

C – Charge Attack/ Combo Slash

F – Finisher / Final Slash

Gorou EQ > Albedo E > Mona EQ > Itto combo string [see combo section]

Summary

Arataki Itto has proven to be quite the balanced character with a respectable performance as a carry. While the teams that he fits in are limiting he does provide some sort of value in not requiring high value units that can be utilized on the other side of Abyss.

A potential downside for Itto teams is having no access to reactions making his damage nowhere near comparable to amp reaction/ chain reaction teams meaning his value is quite low compared to 5 star enablers/supports/carries that are otherwise more impactful.

That being said he offers a very simple playstyle that can be appealing to players along with fine damage that is able to clear comfortably. As always if you like the character and viability/meta does not affect your decision making you are more than welcome to roll for them."

This is the process that powers the sun. Scientists were able to create more energy in a fusion reaction than was used to ignite it.

Corning Inc. announced this week that it played a role in that breakthrough. The glass company’s fused silica components manufactured in Canton served as laser transport optics at the heart of the process.

In simple terms fusion is the process of pressing atoms together so forcefully that they become a new larger element. As result they release massive amounts of heat and energy.

Scientists hope that this could play a role down the road in helping power things humans use.

“Corning’s advanced optics technologies play an essential role in moving our world forward” said John Bayne senior vice president and general manager Corning Mobile Consumer Electronics. “From our optical components that enabled the awe-inspiring James Webb Space Telescope photos to our leading solutions in cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing to our proprietary glass making augmented and mixed reality devices possible Corning’s innovations are vital to progress. We’re thrilled to have contributed optical components for LLNL’s fusion experiments which could ultimately lead to cleaner energy sources that prolong the health of our environment.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15Y2hhbXBsYWludmFsbGV5LmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbmFsLW5ld3MvbWFuLWFycmVzdGVkLWluLWNvcm5pbmctb24tb3Zlci00MDAtY2hpbGQtc2V4LWFidXNlLWNoYXJnZXMv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubXljaGFtcGxhaW52YWxsZXkuY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwtbmV3cy9tYW4tYXJyZXN0ZWQtaW4tY29ybmluZy1vbi1vdmVyLTQwMC1jaGlsZC1zZXgtYWJ1c2UtY2hhcmdlcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man arrested in Corning on over 400 child sex abuse charges,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15Y2hhbXBsYWludmFsbGV5LmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbmFsLW5ld3MvbWFuLWFycmVzdGVkLWluLWNvcm5pbmctb24tb3Zlci00MDAtY2hpbGQtc2V4LWFidXNlLWNoYXJnZXMv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubXljaGFtcGxhaW52YWxsZXkuY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwtbmV3cy9tYW4tYXJyZXN0ZWQtaW4tY29ybmluZy1vbi1vdmVyLTQwMC1jaGlsZC1zZXgtYWJ1c2UtY2hhcmdlcy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021224F05720>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

There's no place like Costco. (Sorry Sam's Club but you just can't hold a candle to this wholesale juggernaut (even if the differences between you two are relatively minor).) Costco's membership model and bulk item deals have turned it into the world's second-largest retailer only outdone by Walmart (via Statista).

Costco boasts 847 locations in 14 countries and a membership base of 120.9 million. These numbers reflect a business largely defined by bulk from its wholesale products to the sheer vastness of its warehouses averaging 146000 square feet. For a first-timer stepping into one of these stores gives one pause as the mind struggles to wrap itself around a place where you can seemingly find everything.

And when we say everything we mean everything. In 2019 Insider told the story of a couple in Hawaii who got married in the Costco aisle where they met showing that cheap gas and rental cars are just the tip of the iceberg. You can even find love at Costco. That Insider story is just one of many glowing appraisals of the wholesale giant which by and large receives great press.

Here’s how to visit the locations from the Netflix show.

If you’re like millions of people around the world it’s highly likely you’ve taken the tumultuous journey through British royal history with “The Crown.” The Emmy-winning Netflix series has enthralled viewers with drama costumes and historical sites since it was released in 2016. The show begins its final sixth and final season on Nov. 16.

Using a cast of frequently changing actors the show brings the extensive reign of Queen Elizabeth II to life — though Britain’s government has urged fans to remember that the series is loosely based on past events and is in fact a work of fiction.

Royal residences and key landmarks are also staged in the show with country houses and cathedrals serving as stand-ins for Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey.

If you’re looking to plan your own trip through the show here are some of the locations that are used as stand-ins for royal homes and historic buildings — and how to visit them.

Wilton House and Lancaster House (Buckingham Palace)

Almost 100 miles from London’s Buckingham Palace stands Wilton House a sprawling 14000-acre estate in Wiltshire England and one of the homes that subs as the luxury royal residence in “The Crown.”

With its rose gardens Gothic hall Tudor tower and crimson silk velvet curtains the mansion is considered one of Britain’s finest country homes and serves as a fine stand-in for the palace in seasons 1 2 and 3.

Built by the first Earl of Pembroke in the 1540s Wilton House now belongs to the 18th Earl and Countess of Pembroke William Herbert and Victoria Bullough. The couple open their doors to the public at certain times throughout the year. Organized tours take visitors through state rooms dating back to the 17th century and into the ornate library which fans of the show will recognize as the queen’s drawing room.

Just a five-minute walk from Buckingham Palace is London’s Lancaster House a Grade I-listed mansion (the highest historical significance) with Louis XIV-style interiors that have been used by the show’s producers to depict life inside the royal palace for at least four seasons. The house which was commissioned in 1825 by the Duke of York features a sweeping staircase a music room chandeliers and Corinthian columns.

Formerly a royal residence Lancaster House is now managed by the British government. The venue has been used for international summits formal dinners and conferences. The venue is available to book for private events.

Ardverikie Estate (Balmoral Estate)

At the heart of Scotland’s Ardverikie Estate in Kinloch Laggan Inverness-shire lies Ardverikie House a striking 19th-century building that serves as the perfect substitute for Balmoral Castle in several episodes. Balmoral the Scottish home of the royal family since 1852 is where Elizabeth died in September.

Nestled in woodland with “pepper-pot” turrets and high gray walls the buildings are strikingly similar. Ardverikie is surrounded by mountains lakes wild red deer and some 38000 acres of land. Balmoral about an 80-mile drive can be found in Aberdeenshire surrounded by some 50000 acres of peaceful landscape.

The public is welcome to tour Ardverikie Estate according to the official website. Those who want to spend the night can pick from cottages a farmhouse or an isolated eco-pod.

Somerleyton Hall (Sandringham Estate)

Somerleyton Hall in Suffolk England is the 5000-acre estate used to re-create Sandringham House a country retreat long cherished by generations of British royalty.

Somerleyton and Sandringham are linked by design according to Somerleyton Hall’s events manager Peter Thompson. “Both were originally Jacobean houses that were extensively remodeled in the Victorian era so they have a very similar feel and sensibility about them.”

Thompson said that filming inside the hall and the grounds was a “mammoth operation” and that it took 12 days to strip contents from the hall and redress it for just three days of filming. Specialist teams photographed the original layout of rooms and their contents so all items would eventually be returned to their original place.

In Season 4 Princess Diana played by Emma Corrin dances in Somerleyton’s ballroom in Episode 9 as her marriage to Prince Charles continues to unravel.

Lord and Lady Somerleyton Hugh Crossley and Lara Bailey live at Somerleyton Hall so the venue is closed to the public though visitors are invited to tour 12 acres of lush green gardens between April and October each year.

Burghley House (Windsor Castle)

Burghley House a Tudor mansion with arched windows and towering walls in Lincolnshire England plays the role of Windsor Castle in Season 4 of “The Crown.” Earlier seasons depicting the castle were recorded at Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire.

The real Windsor Castle in England has served as home for about 40 British kings and queens in the past 1000 years.

Although producers of the show used the grand 16th-century English country house to capture its regal interior Burghley was also used in Season 5 of the show to re-create the 1992 Windsor fire that devastated the royal family and sparked a five-year restoration project that cost roughly 37 million pounds.

The blaze burned for 15 hours and took 1.5 million gallons of water to extinguish. The queen arrived at Windsor after the blaze a moment re-created by actor Imelda Staunton in Season 5.

Burghley House was built by Queen Elizabeth I’s Lord High Treasurer between 1555 and 1587. Visitors can book to stay overnight in the Dairy opt for a luxury tent on the grounds or book a room at the William Cecil within the estate. People can also take a tour online.

Hylands House (The White House)

Hylands House in Chelmsford England usually hosts weddings private business events and parties. But the Grade II-listed building which is set within 574 acres of historic parkland is also featured in “The Crown” as a stand-in for the White House.

With its pearly exterior front-facing columns and green backdrop Hyland House resembles the U.S. presidential office and residence despite being about 10 hours away by plane.

In Season 3 of the show Helena Bonham Carter plays the queen’s sister Princess Margaret. Scenes depict the princess arriving at the presidential office with husband Antony Armstrong-Jones also known as Lord Snowdon played by Ben Daniels. The two embark on a meeting at the fake White House in Essex with the President Lyndon B. Johnson played by Clancy Brown.

Hylands House is free to explore and is open every third Sunday of the month. Visitors are invited to sit for afternoon tea or watch live music in the courtyard. You can also take a virtual tour.

Royal Yacht Britannia

The Royal Yacht Britannia a.k.a. “the floating palace” served the queen and the royal family for more than 40 years. The ship sailed more than 1 million nautical miles globally.

The vessel was another home for the queen a safe space away from the mainland and used for honeymoons and vacations. The yacht is seen in the latest season of “The Crown” though scenes were not filmed on the real vessel but inside a studio that re-created the ship.

Before the filming of Season 2 “The Crown’s” art director visited the original vessel — now retired and moored in Edinburgh — to photograph draw and capture drone footage of Britannia so the re-creation would be perfect.

The Royal Yacht Britannia said there has been a spike in visitors to the real yacht since it was featured. Guests are asked to book tickets in advance. Want to spend the night? Britannia’s sister ship Fingal is a floating hotel just minutes away.

Ely Cathedral (Westminster Abbey)

Ely Cathedral in the city of Ely in Cambridgeshire England doubles as London’s Westminster Abbey in “The Crown.”

Recall that over the past several decades intermodal was where railway freight growth was projected to be. Gil challenges that business hypothesis. Here I summarize my interpretation of Gil’s observations and then discusses those strategies by focusing upon one of the west’s largest markets the California Central Valley. How might intermodal work there?

Both Gil and I see the same challenges ahead as to where intermodal rail can and will grow. Whether you are in California or North Carolina how do you see the critical choices ahead? Care to share your views?

Here is the direct internet URL link to Gil’s complete reporting and options selection choices: https://www.railwayage.com/news/why-intermodal-isnt-everything-its-cracked-up-to-be/

I begin by reviewing the strategic challenges as an entrepreneur like Gil Lamphere sees them. Gil laid out the financial logic behind the investment risks associated with the railroad industry’s business model for the intermodal sector. He reminded us of how challenging it is for rail carriers to make continuous high-margin returns from hauling trailers and containers on railway cars.

Gil spent years trying to answer the simple question of how profitable intermodal rail was or was not. He was looking to define the complex spreadsheet calculation of just the intermodal sector operating income as a percent of costs. The lower the OR (operating ratio) number the higher the commercial profitability. Put another way expensing only 55% of a railroad’s operating budget to earn a 45% revenue margin is better than having expenses at about 70% with a revenue margin of just 30%.

Gil’s point is this: Given the private railway investment model the standalone intermodal financial feasibility must be measured if intermodal is to continue to attract railway investment. Diverting highway market share and obtaining annual high-volume growth rates are insufficient to define intermodal success if you are in that as a trade business.

I concur. It is a challenge.

Class I railroad prefer to have a business with a constant non-variable flow of goods to make their intermodal operations work profitably. As a business-focused railroader Gil concluded that strategic planning for the intermodal commerce segment has to focus mostly upon the prices and expenses of the enterprise’s income statement. Those changes plus the return on the invested balance sheet assets are the most critical measurements at least to those requiring private investment to drive the business expansion. Focusing upon increasing tons or ton-miles of work performed is less important.

Gil’s Financial Score Card:

This may best represent Gil’s executive summary:

Intermodal is largely a myth under the railroads’ current physical configurations.

Intermodal offers limited and barely adequate service.

Intermodal is an incremental cash flow producer but is challenging when it has to cover a fully allocated cost burden.

Gil’s message is important for all parties including states and shippers to comprehend if you are expecting to collaborate with rail companies on joint-venture intermodal projects.

Here are Gil’s five possible paths going forward to test the intermodal market as I define them. Each option has different associated inputs and risks.

Strategy No. 1: Build It Out wherein the railroads add new track and terminals taking on the market risk by building around specific customer contract terms operating perhaps as many as eight up-to-200-car long daily trains. This strategy uses the shipper-contract promised revenues to leverage a separately financed intermodal subsidiary and price to recover a ROE (return on equity) of ~13% to maybe 20% with a 65% OR.

Strategy No. 2: Selected Hub and Short Shuttle what I rename as a Fixed-Schedule Shuttle “horizontal elevator” type service. Each intermodal train departs and arrives at a precise time throughout the day. It is a railroad carrier hook-and-haul/drop-and-pickup return service—something we at Zeta Tech Associates proposed for others like the The Port of New York and New Jersey and an Israeli Railroad-served inland port operation. The logical distance move might be about 350 to 500 miles but the real market opportunity is in 150 to maybe 250 miles.

Strategy No. 3: Restructured for a Low-Cost Center a “selected short line lanes” service as in Georgia or the mixed CSX train connecting Wilmington to Charlotte N.C. Sort of a niche market.

Strategy No. 4: Mixed Intermodal/ Merchandise/Transloading. This is built around intermodal and blended transload carload freight commodities that share a common O/D lane with mixed cargo types at the same key ports. This leverages higher profit returns for coastal and inland port market pairs that have blends of container and either general cargo freight or selected premium bulk agricultural exports.

Strategy No. 5: All-in P&G-Like Model. This approach might work if railroad management has the investor backing to risk a presumed “Proctor & Gamble” optimistic marketing strategy. That classic entrepreneurial thinking assumes that as volume grows and more and more trucks are shifted to rail the result has got to be an improving profit margin. It might work but it’s a bit risky not fully proven.

Wait: There is a sixth choice: Do Nothing Strategy. Many economists define this as the classic “milk-it” strategy. Invest very little added capital be satisfied with a probable 10% to 12% rate of return and a PSR-like free cash flow profit at an OR between 55 and 65 characterized by the absence of any significant market share gains. This model has a high probability of becoming an eventual exit strategy.

Failures Among Some Successes

Yes there clearly are challenges. But let’s acknowledge that when using confidential railway costing models some of us have identified clear high volume density corridors where intermodal trains do already operate profitably and where additional margin might be achieved by modifying the business model used. Those opportunities have to be balanced against certain risks.

For a balanced scorecard let’s acknowledge that not every intermodal project tested has succeeded. There are failures. Several Class I’s have exited markets toward which they used to be opportunistic. For example Norfolk Southern and others tried a West Virginia intermodal project and it never caught on with customers. The reasons are not fully understood but possibly it was due to an overestimation of the regional market demand. The terminal was sold off last year in an auction.

My takeaway message: Anyone planning a new intermodal terminal or route service should assume that private ventures come with an unspoken but possible failure rate. The lesson learned is that each new project must have its own due diligence review. How much risk is hard to exactly predict but case history reviews suggest that about one-third may not achieve their strategic business targets.

Still failure is part of the natural cleansing when you employ private initiatives. Closing some down and selling the parts off is a natural part of testing new markets.

Some Unexpected Successes

About a decade ago a large all-new hub-and-spoke CSX terminal built at New Baltimore Ohio (south of Toledo) didn’t pan out as expected. But that business outcome had an unexpected upside. What might be characterized as a CSX intermodal stumble became perhaps a BNSF win. BNSF negotiated a deal whereby today this CSX Ohio location looks like a forward BNSF Logistics Park far to the east of BNSF’s normal Chicago operating territory. Under a freely negotiated arrangement CSX earns revenue by hauling BNSF intermodal trains between the Chicago terminal and northwestern Ohio under a special haulage agreement. So in October 2018 BNSF extended its direct West Coast intermodal service east as far as western Ohio. It’s five days a week. two trains per day in each direction. CSX also earns a rental use income from the “sunk cost” intermodal yard it built. Who saw that outcome back around 2012?

BNSF corporate marketing map

I’m not sure that this business outcome fits neatly into the five strategies outlined by Gil. Let’s call it a hybrid operation. Very few of us old hands projected this positive outcome:

This boils down to opportunities for one company to have an operation of its private train over another carrier’s tracks with both parties earning commercial compensation. This type of business model might be used going forward on other routes.

This week the editors of Railfan & Railroad Magazine are looking at some of the biggest stories in railroading in 2022. Be sure to check Railfan.com every weekday all year long for all your (free) railroad news and if you like what you see consider subscribing.

In 2021 the biggest story in railroading were the mergers and acquisitions that would change the railroad map in the year to come. Twelve months later one of those acquisitions has been completed while two more await a likely high green from federal regulators. Because of those transactions nearly every railfan had at least one of the following on their “must-see” list in 2022: Pan Am Railways Kansas City Southern and Montana Rail Link.

The Final Hours: Pan Am Railways SPED (Springfield to East Deerfield Mass.) passes through Holyoke Mass. on the night of May 31 2022 not long before CSX Transportation took over the New England regional. Photo by Justin Winiarz.

Pan Am became the first to fall when CSX Transportation took over the New England regional — the largest independent railroad in the country — on June 1. The takeover of Pan Am ended owner Timothy Mellon’s 41-year reign over New England railroading. Mellon’s Guilford Transportation Industries took over the Maine Central in 1981 the Boston & Maine in 1983 and the Delaware & Hudson in 1984. The latter turned into a financial boondoggle and Guilford cast off the bankrupt D&H after just four years. After that the combined MEC-B&M system would remain mostly unchanged for the next three decades. In 2006 the railroad changed its name to Pan Am Railways but the gray and orange Guilford scheme still remains on some locomotives today although many were repainted in a simple but attractive blue and white.

For railfans of a certain generation Guilford was a pariah that had swallowed up the iconic Pine Tree and Minute Man routes. Its rocky relations with labor didn’t help its reputation either particularly during a series of contentious strikes in the late 1980s. But to fans a little bit younger Guilford was a source of fascination especially for enthusiasts of older power. Up until the 2000s Guilford maintained an eclectic fleet of motive power including EMD SD26s GP7s and General Electric U18Bs and U23Bs. Even the Guilford gray and orange scheme seemed to be more appealing with each passing year. And in an era of corporately-owned short line and regional railroad operations that frequently look the same from one road to another an independent regional railroad was something to celebrate regardless of its roots.

But the Pan Am-CSX deal was a ripple compared to the tidal wave created by the proposed Kansas City Southern-Canadian Pacific merger which has been making its way through the review process for more than a year and a half. If approved it would create a 20000-mile network connecting Canada the United States and Mexico. As the new year approaches it looks as if the U.S. Surface Transportation Board will either approve or deny the transaction in the next few months. If approved it would be the first Class I merger in more than 20 years and considering that there will then be just six Class Is in North America afterward it will likely be the last.

What exactly the image of the combined “Canadian Pacific Kansas City” will look like is unclear. While CP is the dominant partner in the marriage — and as a result most railfans have focused on the 7300-mile KCS with its flashy “Southern Belle” locomotives — it’s not a sure thing that the CP’s equally iconic image will escape unchanged. Will “Canadian Pacific Kansas City” simply be a corporate identity behind the enduring “Golden Beaver” shield adorning the side of locomotives from Calgary to Lazero Cardenas? Or will both roads fade in a new brand CPKC Railway much like how “BNSF” and “CSX” emerged from past mergers?

But while the CSX-Pan Am and CP-KCS deals were known long before the calendar turned to 2022 the one transaction that shocked everyone this year was the announcement in January that BNSF would be taking over fan-favorite Montana Rail Link. Consisting of the former Northern Pacific main line through southern Montana and northern Idaho MRL had been a popular railfan destination for years thanks to its clean EMD power great scenery and friendly crews. The railroad was created in 1987 when Montana businessman Dennis Washington leased the NP-main line from Burlington Northern for 60 years. But earlier this year BNSF and MRL decided to end that lease early. Since BNSF already owns the tracks and most of the trains over those tracks originate from the Class I it seems unlikely the STB will delay the transaction.

On November 18 MRL asked the STB for an exemption from the normal review process for the discontinuance of common carrier service. Attorneys for the regional railroad argue that MRL’s discontinuation of service will not negatively impact employees or customers. A few weeks later the STB announced that it would make a decision on that petition by March 8. The timeline put forward by the federal regulator suggests that MRL could become a fallen flag during the first half of 2023.

The quick timeline is a reminder that the only constant is change and if you want to see some of these fan favorites now is the time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvcHNwZWVkLmNvbS9hbWVyaWNhbi1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1jYXJzLXRoYXQtY2FuLWJlLWNsYXNzaWZpZWQtYXMtdWx0aW1hdGUtc2xlZXBlcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 American Performance Cars That Can Be Classified As Ultimate Sleepers,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.topspeed.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /american-performance-cars-that-can-be-classified-as-ultimate-sleepers/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021223BA66E0>, 'Connection to www.topspeed.com timed out.

However the lights automatically activated at the approach of the southbound train which had 188 cars. Pinchuk walked away from her vehicle before it was hit by the locomotive which pushed the car to the intersection of East Central Avenue. Sumter County sheriff’s deputies found Pinchuk walking near the area of the initial collision.

A witness dialed 911 to report what had happened. The witness reported seeing a blonde woman “lingering” around according to the arrest report from the Florida Highway Patrol.

A CSX employee who responded to the scene estimated the damage to the tracks to be $150000.

The FHP trooper investigating the incident suspected Pinchuk had been drinking and asked her to perform field sobriety exercises. She demanded to speak to the trooper’s supervisor and said she wanted a lawyer. She also refused to provide a breath sample.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vdmludGFnZW1vdG9yc3BvcnQuY29tLzIwMjIvMTIvMjYvZXhwZWN0LXRoZS1leHRyYW9yZGluYXJ5LWF0LXJtLXNvdGhlYnlzLTIwMjMtc2Vhc29uLW9wZW5lci1pbi1hcml6b25hL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Expect the extraordinary at RM Sotheby's 2023 season opener in Arizona,"After an unprecedented and record-breaking year RM Sotheby’s is thrilled to launch into 2023 with a return to the Arizona Biltmore & Spa in Phoenix on January 26 for its 24th annual Arizona sale.

When temperatures reach 0F and below diesel-powered vehicles often struggle with gelling diesel fuel freezing DEF and rough-running engines. Modern diesel vehicles do better than older ones but how will our 2022 Ram HD 2500 Cummins turbo-diesel fair after sitting outside all night with temperatures dipping below -14F? Let’s find out!

While many of us are recovering from record-setting cold temperatures some are still entangled in freezing and snowy conditions. If your truck has a block heater grid heater glow plug system or radiator heater – you would be smart to use it. Our new Ram HD Cummins has a grid heater (which has its own durability problems). However our truck did not come with a heater wire & plug. This part is not easy to get at this time as the demand is high.

While some sports refrain from this the game of ice hockey adores it. The sport saw one of its most brutal and bloody brawls in an NHL game between the California Golden Seals and Philadelphia Flyers on December 2 1973. One player received a pounding from six players!

California Golden Seals defenseman Barry Cummins raised his stick toward Philadelphia Flyers center Bobby Clarke. After that all hell broke loose. In Brad Kurtzberg’s 2006 book Shorthanded: The Untold Story of the Seals: Hockey’s Most Colorful Team Cummins described the incident.

NHL witnessed a spine-chilling fight:

The former player recalled “I got a stick in the eye (from Clarke). My eye bled and I couldn’t see. I reacted. I picked up my stick and did the same thing.” Soon after the ‘Broad Street Bullies‘ came up and made it a point to show their presence. Winger Joey Johnston of California spoke to Hockey Digest about the details of the fight.

He said “Bob Kelly went out with his stick and Dave Schultz and then the rest. Ed Van Impe was going around jabbing Cummins with his stick—spearing him. There’s gotta be six guys pounding him while this was going on.”

Fighting in ice hockey is a familiar instance. Enforcers or goons may start the fight as a system of unwritten rules known as ‘The Code’ governs it.

Despite six players pounding one player the Flyers player Kelly explained how “Cummins got what he deserved” as Bill Flett added “It’s easy to kill somebody. I don’t know who that goon was but you can bet if he stays around there will be a lot of people taking runs at him.”

Players received bans and fines!

While Bobby Clarke received 12 stitches due to the fight Cummins had three stitches a $300 fine and a three-game suspension. Even though the Flyers won the game this ugly fight marred the 5-1 victory.

Barry Cummins played 36 games in the NHL while his counterpart was an icon of the Flyers. Bobby Clarke claimed two Stanley Cups in a 15-year tenure with the team and was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players.

Hackett 43 coached 15 games with the Broncos finishing with four wins and eleven losses. His team carried playoff expectations into the season after acquiring Super Bowl champion quarterback Russell Wilson in a blockbuster trade in the offseason.

However Wilson and the team have not lived up to those expectations and tempers have flared in public. After a 51-14 blowout loss to the Los Angeles Rams on Christmas Day Broncos owner George Penner and general manager George Paton decided to move on without Hackett with two games remaining on the schedule.

""Following extensive conversations with George and our ownership group we determined a new direction would ultimately be in the best interest of the Broncos"" team owner and CEO Greg Penner said in a statement. ""This change was made now out of respect for everyone involved and allows us to immediately begin the search for a new head coach.""

Penner said fans ""deserve much better"" and called the current situation with the Broncos ""a challenging stretch for our team.""

We have parted ways with Head Coach Nathaniel Hackett.

""Moving forward we will carefully evaluate every aspect of our football operations and make whatever changes are necessary to restore this franchise's winning tradition"" Penner added.

Hackett became the fifth coach in NFL history to be fired before the end of his first season according to ESPN's Field Yates.

With this firing there will now be at least three head coaching vacancies in the NFL when the season ends. The Carolina Panthers and Indianapolis Colts let go of their head coaches earlier this season.

""In this holiday season we have three problems. We have RSV influenza and COVID-19. We never had such an amount of people getting sick at the same time"" Dr. Ilan Shapiro a pediatrician at AltaMed Health Services told CBS News.

The ""tripledemic"" is impacting Americans like the Schoenherr family in Wisconsin. All of them had the sniffles but their 19-month-old daughter Elizabeth had it the worst.

""It started out as a cold and progressed within a couple of days to extremely high fevers"" her mother Meghann Schoenherr said. She and her husband believe Elizabeth had the flu — just one of the viruses keeping doctors busy.

The ""tripledemic"" is causing another problem at drug stores: a run on children's pain relievers like acetaminophen and ibuprofen.

Michelle Lozano the owner of East LA Pharmacy said she's never seen a shortage like this before.

""It is a national shortage. It's not just our pharmacy"" Lozano said.

To combat part of the problem the U.S. government released reserves of Tamiflu. CVS Target and Walgreens are limiting purchases of over-the-counter children's medication to prevent stockpiling.

CVS has a two-product limit in-store and online. Target placed a two-product limit for online purchases. Walgreens is allowing customers to purchase six products per online transaction.

Schoenherr said she searched everywhere for medication for her daughter.

""I had myself looking my husband's checking and we had our pastor looking both my parents my siblings. Nobody could find anything!"" she said.

Dr. Sean O'Leary the chair of infectious disease for the American Academy of Pediatrics said ""the manufacturers are still manufacturing these medicines as much as they always have been. We are just seeing unprecedented demand.""

He added that parents shouldn't panic if their child is experiencing mild to moderate symptoms.

""You know this is not going to lead to any kind of a complication with your child. These are medicines simply to make your child more comfortable"" O'Leary said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9qYW1pZS1jaHVuZy1zaGFyZXMtY2hyaXN0bWFzLXBob3Rvcy0wMDU1NTA5NDIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jamie Chung Shares Christmas Photos of Her Twins Teases 'What Did I Get the Boys?',"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cml_VgwLKoM/ jamiejchung's profile picture jamiejchung Verified Merry Christmas from our chunky reindeers to yours!!

Jamie Chung gave her twins quite the gift for their second Christmas.

The Dexter: New Blood actress 39 shared some photos and a video to Instagram of her adorable 1-year-olds who were dressed in Rudolph onesies — celebrating the holiday by their tiny Christmas tree.

In the first photo Chung hugs one twin to her chest while she looks at the other sitting by the tree. A stuffed sloth and wrapped presents can be seen in the background. In another photo she crouches down to her twins and gazes at them as they look out the windows.

A final candid shot shows one of her twins with his reindeer hoodie up crawling to the other. Chung made sure that her children's faces weren't fully visible in the pictures something she's done with other photos posted on social media.

""Merry Christmas from our chunky reindeers to yours!! What did I get the boys for Christmas?"" Chung teased.

In a second follow-up post uploaded hours later she finally revealed what she gave them as a gift.

""They got a banana for Christmas since they got so many noise-making toys for Hanukkah. And let me tell you. This banana was a hit!"" she wrote on the video which shows the twins climbing up on a play set with one of them holding a banana.

""🍌 🎁 A peel good gift"" Chung joked in the caption.

""Their pediatrician told us to let them try everything you're eating so every meal that I have ordered or cooked at home I was able to see their reaction to trying it"" she shares. ""It's fun to see how one son is really weird about textures and the other one is just a garbage disposal.""

""I'm looking forward to all of it.""

The Atlanta-based carrier filed six new domestic routes over the Christmas weekend as first seen in Cirium schedules and later confirmed by an airline spokesperson.

The new flights won't start until spring 2023 (at the earliest) but they are all available for purchase as of Sunday Dec. 25 giving travelers dreaming of warm-weather escapes plenty of possible destinations.

All six routes are focused on boosting connectivity in the Northeast and you'll find the full list below.

Delta's six new domestic routes. COURTESY CIRIUM

Most of the new routes will be operated by Delta Connection affiliate Republic Airways using the 76-seat Embraer E175 regional jet which features 12 first-class recliners 20 Comfort+ extra-legroom seats and 44 economy seats in a comfortable 2-2 configuration.

Delta will operate flights between Washington D.C. and both Miami and Orlando using an Airbus A320 which features 157 seats. Delta's A320s sport 16 first-class recliners 18 Comfort+ extra-legroom seats and 123 economy seats.

While these routes are all new to Delta's schedule many of them have been operated in years past. For instance the Boston-to-Memphis flight last operated in January 2014 while the service from Boston to Louisville last regularly operated in June 2008 Cirium schedules show.

Delta will not hold a monopoly on any of these six routes when each commences. In fact American Airlines operates service in all six markets meaning that Delta will go head-to-head against one of its biggest competitors on each route.

(Southwest also operates flights between Washington D.C. and both Nashville and Orlando while JetBlue flies between D.C. and Orlando.)

ZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY

Delta is no stranger to defending and growing its position in key markets and it's likely no surprise to aviation observers that the carrier will go up against American in additional routes focused on the Northeast.

American operates a hub at the Reagan National Airport so Delta will likely be competing for O&D (origin and destination) traffic in this market.

Meanwhile Delta has been neck-in-neck in Boston for the title of the region's largest airline and the two new routes launching in May could help the carrier reassert its dominance in a key city.

Under the Northeast Alliance tie-up between American and JetBlue Airways the two airlines have added a slew of new routes and additional frequencies from Boston so Delta may be feeling some competitive pressure.

ZACH GRIFF/THE POINTS GUY

But perhaps most interestingly Delta is adding routes at LGA and DCA which are two of the nation's most capacity-constrained airports.

To manage capacity these airports are categorized as Level 3 facilities by the Federal Aviation Administration meaning that takeoff and landing permissions are administered via slots.

Each new flight requires a slot pair and Delta didn't remove any flights or cut any routes to or from LGA or DCA as part of this week's schedule load.

It remains to be seen whether Delta acquired new slots to operate these flights or whether the carrier will eventually trim flights elsewhere to free up slots for these routes.

Separately Delta made a notable boost to one of its flagship domestic routes to Hawaii. Over the weekend Delta extended the schedule for its 4431-mile Atlanta-to-Maui route to operate year-round.

Flights had previously been filed as seasonal winter service but the plan was always to upgrade the flight to year-round service a carrier spokesperson confirmed back in February.

Now Delta is following through on that plan which will make it easier than ever for travelers based in the Southeast to get to one of Hawaii's most popular destinations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvZGVsdGEtZmxpZ2h0LTM1Ni1lbWVyZ2VuY3ktbGFuZGluZy1uYXNodmlsbGUtZW5naW5lL9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2RlbHRhLWZsaWdodC0zNTYtZW1lcmdlbmN5LWxhbmRpbmctbmFzaHZpbGxlLWVuZ2luZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta flight makes emergency landing in Nashville due to possible engine issue,"A Delta flight traveling from Atlanta to Sacramento was forced to make an emergency landing Monday morning in Nashville due to reports of engine trouble the airline said Monday.

Delta Flight 356 a 757 aircraft had 185 passengers on board and six crew members. It took off at 8:46 a.m. according to Flight Aware and landed about an hour later at Nashville. Delta said in a statement that the crew received a notification of a possible engine issue and they ""elected to divert to Nashville where the aircraft landed without incident.""

Delta said it would send another aircraft to pick up those customers.

Delta's flight woes come during one of the busiest travel periods of the year. There were more than 10000 flights delayed and 2500 flights canceled on Thursday Dec. 22 alone — one of the busiest travel days of the year — as a cross-country storm slammed major travel hubs in the Midwest with snow and in the south with freezing cold temperatures.

The weather and travel woes continued throughout the holiday weekend especially after a bomb cyclone — when atmospheric pressure drops very quickly in a strong storm — developed near the Great Lakes. Blizzard conditions and freezing temperatures gripped the region especially in western New York and Buffalo.

As of 1 p.m. ET on Monday there were already more than 4500 flight delays and 2600 flight cancellations within into or out of the U.S. according to Flight Aware.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9kZWx0YS1haXItbGluZXMtYm9laW5nLTc1Ny1lbWVyZ2VuY3ktbGFuZGluZy1uYXNodmlsbGUtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1haXJwb3J0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Air Lines Boeing 757 Makes Emergency Landing At Nashville International Airport,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='simpleflying.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /delta-air-lines-boeing-757-emergency-landing-nashville-international-airport/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021223BA4F40>, 'Connection to simpleflying.com timed out.

The carrier has started new nonstop service from both Boston Logan Airport and Detroit’s Wayne County Airport to San Juan’s Luis Munoz Marin International Airport.

The new flights will represent an additional 25000 seats for Puerto Rico’s tourism industry between December and April 2023.

“The air access sector continues to strengthen as renowned airlines such as Delta Air Lines continue betting on the combination of modern infrastructure diversity of options and accessibility that Puerto Rico has as a world-class destination in the Caribbean region” said Carlos Mercado Santiago the executive director of the Puerto Rico Tourism Company.

Digital Realty Hellas acquired a property next to Athens Campus which hosts its other data centers ATH1 and 2. ATH3 is under construction and although slightly delayed is expected to be operational by March 2023; the company recently acquired the permit to build ATH4 planned to be completed by 2024.

Together ATH1-4 will have a capacity of 31.1 megawatts. Digital Realty Hellas is also building a 6.5 MW data center Heraklion 1 in Crete to be completed by 2025 that will bring its total capacity to 37.6 MW.

Outgoing chairman and CEO Apostolos Kakkos said that the investment will complete his personal vision of making Greece an important digital hub. “I am proud of the fact that Digital Realty has already become by far the biggest data center services provider in Southeast Europe” he said adding that through its investments the company will create a total added value in excess of €4 billion and that it will double its personnel over the next few years.

Kakkos who has led Lamda Hellix for 21 years will be succeeded at the end of the year by Alexandros Bechrakis currently the Company’s Chief Commercial and Technology Officer.

This content was paid for and produced by OMRON in partnership with the Commercial Department of the Financial Times.

The COP27 UN climate conference in Sharm El-Sheik Egypt brought together diverse stakeholders to discuss issues related to the climate crisis. More than 2000 speakers covered over 300 topics including water and food security biodiversity loss decarbonisation efforts and the clean energy transition.

What matters now is translating these words into action.

Ahead of the gathering Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi the host of COP27 said the conference would be an opportunity for the world to move ""from negotiation to implementation"" and embark on a greener future. Keeping the focus on outcomes is relevant because lofty language about ESG inclusion and diversity has become commonplace at high-level climate discussions. However going from talk to walk requires top-down leadership and bottom-up initiatives to drive sustainable actions.

OMRON the Japanese technology company is one company building such a culture.

Practising its purpose

Since its founding in 1933 OMRON has produced unique technologies spanning factory automation to healthcare devices. These innovations are driven by its founding principle: ""To improve lives and contribute to a better society"".

Guided by this purpose the company encourages employees to set their own goals for solving social issues in the OMRON Global Awards (TOGA) programme. Teams behind the shortlisted initiatives selected from thousands of entries worldwide gather at company headquarters in Kyoto every year to share their projects.

Past winning initiatives have included efforts to develop the world's first wearable blood pressure monitor to prevent cardiovascular events and reduce the number of industrial robot accidents.

""I started TOGA because I wanted to expand the circle of resonance by sharing stories of each employee's initiative to put OMRON principles into practice and draw out the passion and potential of our employees"" says Yoshihito Yamada the president and CEO of OMRON.

Eliminating plastic waste

Last year's winning entry -- ""Eliminate marine plastic waste!"" -- captures Yamada's vision well.

The project aimed to reduce plastic waste by developing a technology for wrapping consumer items using sustainable materials. Project leader Miho Nishide who was developing temperature controllers at the firm's components division approached over 80 device makers and research institutes to conduct demonstrations and experiments on her concept.

The result was the Perfect Sealing solution. The innovative solution combines OMRON's sensing and control technologies to reduce temperature changes at the bonding surface to a tenth of previous devices virtually eliminating packaging defects. This feature allows manufacturers to switch from plastic to more sustainable materials such as Kraft paper thinner packaging and biodegradable film which are sensitive to heat levels. Over 350 manufacturers have already adopted the Perfect Sealing solution saving an estimated 1m tonnes of plastic waste.

""Solutions to social issues are not easy to find but OMRON encourages its employees to take on new challenges. We worked tirelessly to find a breakthrough by bringing together knowledge from within and outside the company"" says Nishide.

Services for people and the planet

On the factory floor automation is not just about maximising efficiencies in resource and energy use - thereby reducing the environmental footprint of manufacturing.

At OMRON's healthcare plant a multidisciplinary team from the company's industrial automation and healthcare divisions is working to unlock a next-generation energy productivity solution.

Based on data-driven automation that visualises production volume quality and energy consumption at their respective production bases the solution - this year's TOGA winner - demonstrates the potential for energy reduction. Through such energy-control technology the company aims to realise more sustainable manufacturing in the future.

Automation can also address social issues such as the diversification of consumer needs a shortage of skilled workers and soaring labour costs.

For example in healthcare OMRON's automatic blood pressure monitors (which have sold over 300m units globally) and other healthcare devices continue to evolve. The goal is to create services which automatically monitor and predict cardiovascular events and asthma attacks thereby contributing to extending healthy lives.

And to fight climate change the company is expanding its line-up of storage battery systems combined with solar power systems to facilitate distributed renewable energy. As a result its greenhouse gas emissions are set to fall by 53 per cent between FY2016 and FY2024 and scope 3 by 18 per cent for the same period with a target of net-zero operational carbon emissions by 2050.

More recently the company joined the EP100 -- a global initiative led by the international non-profit Climate Group -- bringing together over 120 energy-smart businesses committed to measuring and reporting on energy efficiency improvements.

""OMRON continues to deliver on its 'Shaping the Future' commitments based on our mission to improve lives and contribute to a better society. This includes combatting the social issue of climate change by working to achieve global climate neutrality. We do this by empowering people through automation. We are pioneers committed to solving social issues through business. As such OMRON became the first Japanese manufacturer to join the EP100 - an initiative to address climate change by improving energy efficiency - pledging to double its energy productivity"" says Preben Olsen president OMRON Management Center of Europe. ""The EU - with its European Green Deal - is at the forefront of the global mission to achieve climate neutrality. OMRON's European office serves as the driving force behind our global efforts to transparently disclose to the world how we deliver on our climate change commitments and accomplish our ambition of net zero carbon emissions.""

Certified sustainability targets

Leading ESG rating organisations have recognised OMRON's ambitious sustainability targets. Dow Jones Sustainability World FTSE4Good and MSCI ESG Leader Index have selected OMRON for their indices. The firm has also won high marks from the green disclosure group CDP for its leadership in environmental issues and disclosure transparency and achieved the silver class distinction in the 2022 S&P Global Sustainability Awards.

Earlier this year OMRON elevated non-financial targets as part of its management objectives. By working towards these ESG goals in partnership with stakeholders OMRON says it is striving to create solutions to social issues through its business. By further evolving its corporate management the company is on a path to create sustainable business growth and find solutions to more diverse social issues in the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy53aGF0Y29tdGFsay5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8yNi9kaXNjb3Zlci1sZXNzZXIta25vd24tYmVhY2hlcy10aGF0LWFyZS1oaWRkZW4tZ2Vtcy1uZWFyLXJ1YnktYmVhY2gtb24tdGhlLXdhc2hpbmd0b24tY29hc3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Discover Lesser-Known Beaches That Are Hidden Gems Near Ruby Beach on the Washington Coast - WhatcomTalk,"Many who are interested in geotourism or have traveled the Olympic Peninsula Loop are familiar with the majestic Ruby Beach. Not only is the name glamorous but the towering sea stacks and red colored minerals in the sand make this stop a true gem to experience while visiting the Washington Coast. For nature lovers who seek quiet reverence without crowds visit the other Kalaloch beaches near Ruby Beach on the Olympic Peninsula that are jewels in their own right.

Where To Hike While Visiting the Olympic Peninsula

The Kalaloch beaches named simply Beach 123 and 4 each offer a unique opportunity for wild immersion without an excess of people. The trail to Beach 1 is lined with bulbous spruce burls that give an “Alice in Wonderland” feel to the area. Cross a wooden bridge to find long stretches of coastline that is less frequented by tourists.

Beach 2 begins with a vibrant forest walk which winds down to a wide and sandy beach below. Here explorers can observe the driftwood forts that are decorated with cairns made from the abundance of river stones.

Beach 3 offers extraordinary beauty and tranquil solitude with uniquely curved boulders views of the iconic coastline and intertidal life to explore.

Beach 4 is a hidden gem of the Olympic Peninsula which offers a parking lot and bathrooms upon arrival. The interpretive trail which is excellent for bird watching winds down an invigorating path to a charming driftwood bridge. Make sure to check Washington tides before visiting as high tide will cover this beach completely. Beach 4 is one of the best locations to observe the tide pools and is part of the Marine Wildlife Preserve that is protected by the National Park and part of the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary.

North of Beach 4 make sure to turn east off highway 101 onto Big Cedar Road to walk the short and accessible Big Cedar Tree – Kalaloch Trail. This quick drive on a bumpy gravel road ends at a cul-de-sac where visitors can park. Walk a short distance on the well-managed trail and take in the extraordinary view of a massive cedar that is believed to be nearly 1000 years old.

Journey Into the Temperate Coastal Rainforest of the Washington Coast

Erin and Ben Braudrick visit the Washington coast annually and stay in a private Bluff Cabin at the Kalaloch Lodge located in the Olympic National Park. “Each day is a little different” explains Erin. “We enjoy walking our dog Dottie at Beach 2 which is more secluded than the popular Ruby Beach.”

Located just north of Beach 4 follow signs to the Big Cedar Tree to witness the magnificence of this nearly 1000-year-old cedar. Photo credit: Jess Caldwell

“Our favorite adventure is a day trip into the temperate rainforest without all the hullabaloo” adds Ben. “We recommend vacationing in the off-season during the winter months and feel that the South Fork of the Hoh is a reviving best of the pacific northwest kind of encounter that will make a hot shower and warm beverage by the fire so rewarding at the end of the day.”

Based on Ben’s recommendation consider planning a sensory adventure into the complex ecosystem of the rainforest through the South Fork Hoh River – Big Flat Trail. Hikers will enter the Olympic National Park surrounded by a canopy of towering old growth beauty but without the crowds of the popular Hoh Rain Forest.

Although Beaches 1 through 4 were not given catchy names the invitation is to discover for yourself what makes each Kalaloch beach special. The Washington Coast is an all-season vacation destination for all ages.

For more information and ideas to plan a unique travel experience that celebrates profound nature-scapes history agritourism and front-country adventure visit Enjoy the Olympic Peninsula.

These cards are never previewed in any way shape or form by Wizards of the Coast so it’s difficult to know what they are until players start opening their goodies and posting them themselves. This creates some FOMO moments where players open a precious bonus Secret Lair slot but for the most part there are a lot of stinkers. Here are some of the newest bonus slot cards that we currently know about spoiled over the Christmas break!

Shadowborn Apostle

We just talked about this in another article because of just how much this card is an outlier from the other cards we are currently seeing. This Shadowborn Apostle was discovered in a December 2022 Superdrop Secret Lair that shipped early. Found in Just Add Milk this is the newest Shadowborn Apostle among a series of $100 premium cards that tend to hold a ton of value on the secondary market. You can read more about this here.

Frank Frazetta Secret Lair Bonus Card

Everyone’s favorite discount Lightning Bolt is back! This isn’t doing much in excitement or value but the artwork is incredible. Previewed on Reddit you can find this exclusive Secret Lair Bonus Slot card in the art of Frank Frazetta.

While the bonus card isn’t much to scoff at outside of the incredible artwork the same cannot be said for the Frank Frazetta Secret Lair. As one of the most renowned fantasy artists in history the Secret Lair’s artwork is absolutely stunning. Temporal Manipulation and Seize the Day ensure that you get about your money’s worth in terms of singles but these artworks are likely to catch a premium in the secondary market. If you want to buy one of these Secret Lairs you can still do so. Just know that this slot is likely locked so there probably will not be any dice rolling for a Shadowborn Apostle with this Secret Lair.

Aleksi Briclot Secret Lair bonus Card

Previewed on Reddit this Secret Lair bonus card may be slightly disappointing. Considering Eldrazi Tron is on the rise in Modern another copy of Thought-Knot Seer may not be bad. That said the card isn’t exactly doing you any favors financially. These colorless (not Devoid the coloring of the image) cards have been done for past guest artist Secret Lairs and have received varying responses from the community.

Sidewinder Sliver and More

In the continuing trend of full-art Sliver cards Sidewinder Sliver has joined the massive array of Sliver cards you may find in Secret Lairs without a dedicated bonus slot! Another card found in Just Add Milk a Redditor has confirmed that Just Add Milk comes with an unfixed Secret Lair bonus slot.

Sidewinder Sliver gives all creatures Flanking. This is a keyword that we do not see all that often so for context here is what the keyword does! This was taken from another copy of Sidewinder Sliver found in Time Spiral:

“Whenever a creature without flanking blocks a Sliver the blocking creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn.“

The rare Secret Lair Bonus Slot card Tangle Wire has returned. Posted on Reddit this appeared in the Yoji Shinkawa set. This is an older Secret Lair Bonus Slot card part of a series of schematic-like artifacts. These are rarer so they all tend to have a secondary market price but they are far behind that of a Shadowborn Apostle. Those lucky enough to find Tangle Wire who are not interested in it can try to sell it for somewhere between $25 and $35 depending on how poorly the card is warped out of the package.

The Collection of Full Art Slivers Just Keeps Growing

The number of different full-art Sliver cards players find in these Secret Lairs is slowly becoming more and more baffling. It’s challenging to keep track of varying rarities between cards when there are so many different copies constantly being opened at relatively common intervals. It’s therefore becoming increasingly difficult to keep track of which Slivers are returning and which Slivers have been seen before.

To close things off it seems that a new Secret Lair is being teased by Wizards of the Coast. This shouldn’t be a shock to anyone but it was noteworthy enough to get some discussion. This Secret Lair will be a WPN exclusive which is a lot different than what we’ve seen in the past. While this is the first Secret Lair that may not be directly sold by Wizards of the Coast it is still sold exclusively by some of the company’s exclusive partners. Maybe if this does well Wizards of the Coast could make a Secret Lair product for LGS which would be an amazing effort to support the core of the MTG community. If you’re looking forward to Phyrexia: All Will Be One this Secret Lair may be one for the books.

But there's a new cuisine that's gaining a lot of followers and it's famous for its substantial foods tongue-tingling spices and elaborate feasts at which visitors are regarded as ""gifts from God."" Time to introduce yourself to Georgian cuisine.

Georgia which is located at the crossroads of Asia mediterranean Middle East and Europe (along the old Silk Road route) has developed a distinctive culinary culture by absorbing and fusing influences from these regions. The cuisine is dominated by wonderful homemade breads cheeses and meats as well as traditional Georgian ingredients like tarragon walnuts and agika (spicy paste).

Your taste receptors will be on fire for days after eating these delicacies. (And don't forget you'll get the chance to test them out on Trafalgar's Georgia trip!)

The world's greatest comfort meal may very well be Georgian cuisine.

Khachapuri is a pofoopular cheesy bread among locals. However this is unlike anything you've ever experienced. The contrast between the pristine outside and the warm comforting inside is so satisfying that you may find yourself rolling your eyes in delight. Let's speak about some of the permutations now. Yeast-infused pastry filled with salty Imeretian cow's milk cheese is a must-try while in Imeretia.

There's also the boat-shaped khachapuri a favorite of the native Laz inhabitants who formerly roamed the Black Sea. We suggest ripping off the crust and letting it soak in the molten egg melted cheese and melted butter. Remember what we said about tummy stodgers?

Meet khinkali Georgia's meat-filled dumplings in a flavorful soup. These are a staple of Georgian supras (feasts) which typically go late into the night and lead to the satiating state of shemomedjama.

When you take that first mouthful of this steaming delicacy you will feel a rush of pure joy. Suck out the flavorful broth and chow down till you're ready for another serving if you want to fit in with the locals. You can't forget about this famous dish from Georgia.

It's time you learned about badrijana nigvzit another beloved Georgian dish. You may serve these savory fried eggplant rolls as an appetizer or a main course thanks to their filling of walnut paste. As you munch into these goodies and your taste buds dance with the aroma and flavor of coriander cumin turmeric and wonderful walnuts you'll get a taste of the local culture.

After a day exploring Georgia's beautiful outdoors there's nothing better to refuel on than a bowl of kharcho. Beef pieces cherry plum puree walnuts and the signature Georgian spice khmeli-suneli (a blend of bay leaves mint fenugreek seeds coriander parsley and dill) give this soup its delicious aroma. You guessed correctly: a big spoon and a bowl are required for enjoying this Georgian favorite.

The scene looks like this. You've just gotten back from a trip to the Black Sea or the Caucasus Mountains in Georgia and you're hungry. Now please welcome churchkhela candies. To make these brightly colored candelabra-shaped candies walnuts are woven into a string then dipped into a mixture of grape juice flour and sugar and allowed to dry for 5 days. Hazelnuts almonds and/or dried fruits including plums apricots and raisin are also added sometimes. Decide which one you like most and have fun with it!

Vegetable balls may not be the initial item you think to order when you're in a restaurant. However pkhali is precisely what your spirit need. Pomegranate seeds are sprinkled on balls of cooked vegetables such beets spinach eggplant cabbage beans butternut squash or carrots. Beautiful in hue (depending on the vegetable) these are a staple of Georgian supra feasts."

Her almost 100000 Instagram followers enjoy her affordable hauls and hacks which she posts thanks to ""lots of coffee.""

The saving-savvy mom of two recently made a post that she captioned ""Dollar Tree kitchen tools you should and shouldn’t buy!""

""These $1.25 cooking essentials are some of the most useful tools that I keep in my kitchen and I’m excited to hear your thoughts"" she added in the caption of the video.

Sarah also informed her followers that she posted a full YouTube video sharing even more about the products.

BUY

In her video the Instagrammer said that the dollar store's meat chopper is ""a great deal.""

She said that the plastic meat chopper ""works really well.""

""Buy this for $1.25"" Sarah said.

""Similar versions being sold on Amazon for $7.99.""

Sarah showed a large 7.5-inch Santoku knife that you can get for $1.25 and she said that she has tested it out herself.

""I definitely say buy it"" Sarah advised about the knife.

She also suggested silicone pot holders from the store for $1.25.

Sarah admitted that the Dollar Tree pot holder mitts are some of her ""absolute favorites.""

DON'T BUY

The bargaining mom said she wouldn't advise her followers to buy hand graters that can be found at Dollar Tree.

""It falls apart"" she confessed.

""The handle always breaks.""

She added that the hand grater is ""not good quality"" and she ""definitely"" doesn't recommend it.

The Philly-mom said Dollar Tree's brand of aluminum foil is ""a no"" for her.

""We are not buying that"" she said.

""It always runs out.""

Sarah showed some of Dollar Tree's paper plates that she doesn't think people should buy.

""We're passing on the paper plates"" she said.

Then she explained that they're ""not a great deal.""

""They are not good quality and you don't get a lot in the pack"" she said.

A number of her followers chimed in on things that they think people should and shouldn't buy from Dollar Tree.

""Add can opener"" an Instagram user commented.

""Knob just keeps on turning going nowhere.""

Sarah replied saying: ""literally the worst!""

""I’ve gave the can opener so many tries and it breaks every time"" she added in her response.

Another one of her followers admitted that they ""need to check out the Dollar Tree bc there are a few things you mentioned that are in my Amazon cart for 7-10x more!""

The money-saving mom replied saying: ""Seriously!""

""I shared price comparisons on the YouTube video but Dollar Tree has a lot of the same items for a fraction of the price"" Sarah added.

""Dominion Energy and other utility companies are experiencing high demand on the electric system that will continue for the next few days"" the utility company that provides power to portions of Virginia North Carolina West Virginia Ohio and several other states wrote in an email to customers. ""Customers are asked to reduce their energy usage over these next few days to help protect the stability of the electric system.""

Dominion offered the following tips:

Set thermostats to 68 degrees or lower.

Turn off non-essential internal and external lights.

Unplug non-essential appliances and devices.

Limit the use of major power-consuming equipment such as dishwashers washers and dryers.

Ensure HVAC vents are open and unobstructed.

Temperatures in Richmond were expected to be between 16 and 35 degrees Sunday with warmer temperatures (in the 30s and 40s) later in the week.

A Christmas-week winter storm knocked out power in communities from Maine to Seattle and a major electricity grid operator warned 65 million people across the eastern U.S. of possible rolling blackouts.

But heat and lights were steadily being restored across the U.S. According to poweroutage.us less than 300000 customers were without power at 8 a.m. EDT Sunday - down from a peak of 1.7 million. In North Carolina less than 6600 customers had no power - down from a peak of 485000 or more. Utility officials said rolling blackouts would continue for the next few days.

Across the six New England states about 121300 customers remained without power on Sunday with Maine still the hardest hit. Some utilities said electricity may not be restored for days.

Around 900 Dominion customers remained without power in Central Virginia on Christmas morning. The majority of those outages were reported in and around the town of Ashland in Hanover County.

Sherlock

I am referring in the title of course to Dominion Power’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project to be located in the hatched area below.

It is planned for one of the U.S. Department of the Interior’s (DI) Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) offshore wind farm lease areas. Lease areas that have been rendered obsolete by operational modern floating turbine technology.

The area for which CVOW construction is proposed is overlaid below on an operational graphic of Atlantic international maritime vessel density. Red indicates highest density.

There are only a half dozen expanses of water that reach that international vessel density on the entire U.S. Atlantic coast. They are of course the approaches to the East Coast’s major ports.

See the Atlantic Coast Port Access Route Study Final Report Appendix III Fig. 18 below for an operational rendering of international shipping flow at the location proposed for CVOW.

See the coastal shipping traffic chart below.

The nearest point is 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach and the furthest 42 miles offshore. The lease area occupies 112800 acres. One seventh the size of Rhode Island.

Undersea noise propagation characteristics will not be known unless and until it is built.

CVOW if built will threaten:

the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay;

the point at which international maritime traffic funnels to and from the ports of Norfolk and Baltimore;

the point at which coastal maritime traffic on the east coast is most dense; and

the point at which Navy warships and logistics vessels enter and depart the world’s largest naval base.

You might reasonably ask “Of the entire Atlantic Coast why there?” Or you might put it somewhat less gently. Net of all the risks and rewards there is no reasonable answer to that question. Never was.

But the facts have also changed.

At this point Dominion can testify that it must have offshore wind power under Virginia law that itself can be changed.

But because of the deployment of operational floating turbines it can no longer testify that it must source that power from that singular spot at the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay.

CVOW in a class of risk that we used to call a “grenade with the pin pulled” has yet to receive final construction approval from the federal government. But the time is late.

We can ask questions of BOEM in three online public meetings in January and February. You can mail in your questions to BOEM to their office in Sterling listed at the link ahead of those meetings. I will submit this column.

The SCC in an order a couple of weeks ago wrote:

The magnitude of this project is so great that it will likely be the costliest project being undertaken by any regulated utility in the United States. And the electricity produced by this Project will be among the most expensive sources of power — on both a per kilowatt of firm capacity and a per megawatt-hour basis — in the entire United States.

So project risk — project magnitude plus inexperience in offshore wind project management at Dominion – is enormous. It is so big a project that they don’t and won’t hire a prime contractor.

So Dominion is the prime. This is the project they start with?

That SCC action was celebrated as final. It is not. Construction cannot begin until the federal approval is granted.

Whatever approvals have been granted by the SCC will be withdrawn if the General Assembly revises Virginia law to ban energy from that specific place in the ocean.

As it should.

The magnitude and utilization of CVOW. CVOW scheduled pending federal and state approval to begin offshore construction in 2024 in an immense span of ocean leased from the federal government is planned to be a 2.6-gigawatt wind farm.

In the totality of Virginia’s energy needs that is not a lot of energy.

If built it will consist of 176 wind turbines standing slightly more than 800 feet tall three offshore substations to collect and bundle the energy undersea cables to get it ashore and new onshore transmission infrastructure to deliver the energy onto the broader electric grid. At night.

To replace solar energy dormant at night that we have at utility scale because we fund it with federal dollars in foregone tax credits and rebates. Tax dollars that are spent in the name of clean energy.

Those tax credits and rebates are with CVOW about to threaten maritime safety the reliability of the grid and national security.

BOEM. BOEM is given authority and responsibility for granting of leases under

section 388(a) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct) (Pub. L. 109-58)

Requirements under that act are specific. They include:

(4) REQUIREMENTS- The Secretary shall ensure that any activity under this subsection is carried out in a manner that provides for–

(A) safety;

(B) protection of the environment;

(E) coordination with relevant Federal agencies;

(F) protection of national security interests of the United States;

(G) protection of correlative rights in the outer Continental Shelf;

(I) prevention of interference with reasonable uses (as determined by the Secretary) of the exclusive economic zone the high seas and the territorial seas;

(J) consideration of– (i) the location of and any schedule relating to a lease easement or right-of-way for an area of the outer Continental Shelf; and

(ii) any other use of the sea or seabed including use for a fishery a sea lane a potential site of a deepwater port or navigation;

And with that charter they came up with among others the grid on which CVOW is to be built?

In practice that agency considers commercial fishing industry and environmental impacts and picks locations that offer the right wind and bottom conditions.

“Relevant” federal agencies are supposed to provide the rest of the inputs.

BOEM in 2020 released a supplement to its draft environmental impact statement (EIS). That statement found major adverse impacts to commercial fishing and scientific research moderate impacts to marine life and minor impacts to air quality.

Impacts but apparently not obstacles now.

And now the federal map of approved locations similar to that where Dominion hopes to build CVOW has been disrupted by a new technology floating turbines that allows offshore wind farms nearly anywhere. They are proven successful and undergoing accelerated deployment in waters off of the U.K.

But that BOEM map given some combination of bureaucratic inertia and forward-leaning administration ideology persists.

Coastal traffic. The Coast Guard published in 2015 a draft study of the effects of offshore wind farms on maritime traffic on the Atlantic Coast with an utterly negative opinion of the idea. You see the international traffic above. Below is an illustration of the coastal traffic.

The Coast guard objection was beaten back to the point that you cannot find that draft report on the Coast Guard website any more nor can you find there the final study linked above.

The Navy. The CVOW location certainly wasn’t the Navy’s idea.

The Department of the Navy was reportedly consulted in the Obama administration when the lease areas were set but I don’t know whether the operational navy was asked its opinion.

I sincerely doubt it was asked whether it thought that location a good idea.

The Navy if it has to will work to deal with potential enemy submarine threats made more challenging by the physical obstacles in that location and the noise that massive field will put in the water. And with the physical restrictions on ingress and egress routes for the naval bases in South Hampton Roads.

Engineers having never built either a field or wind turbines this size much less in a location like this reportedly have no real idea how that noise will propagate.

If it is built the Navy will measure the noise and its propagation and spend a great deal of money over time to overcome the challenges it will present to defense of the national assets within the Chesapeake Bay.

Marine mammals will either deal with it. Or not.

Money for Navy efforts will be hidden in the defense budget not included in the advertised costs of the project. A hundred studies will be dedicated to technical and operational approaches to dealing with the massive field of towers.

Exercises will be held. The exercises should require shutting down the field as would happen in wartime. Operational commanders will in time of conflict shut CVOW down to eliminate the undersea noise it generates. For the duration of the threat.

But because of floating turbine technology such zones no longer have to hover over the Navy’s bases or major international sea lanes.

But bureaucratic inertia will cause policy to trail transformational change for years. Always does.

CVOW is just the first project at such a strategic location facing a federal construction permit action.

Then there are freedom of navigation operations (FONOPS) arguably the Navy’s most successful mission since WWII. It has kept open sea lanes all over the world to support the international trade that has enriched the world.

We are now doing what we have spent 75 years protecting against extending national interests into international waters. We will have no basis to complain when Russian warships including submarines get very close to CVOW just as we sail into the Black Sea and the new”islands that the Chinese have built near the Philippines.

Perhaps retired admiral submariners not subject to silencing by the Secretary of the Navy will make their voices heard on the national defense matter.

Perhaps the new Republican-led House will hold hearings.

The Greens. The interesting thing is that the Greens don’t care where such generators are located. In their own Sophie’s choice they have long made their peace with killing raptor birds ashore and marine mammals in the ocean in a trade for wind power.

They don’t care whether there is ever a CVOW at that spot in the ocean. They just want offshore wind power. With floating turbine technology now available the options for locating such turbines have expanded immensely.

So CVOW does not have to present an obstacle to international shipping or commercial fishing. It does not ever have to represent a complication to the defense of the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay.

Power generation does not ever have to occur in that spot. Virginians who support clean energy don’t care if it comes from there.

If CVOW winds up being built it will be there because it was available Dominion leased it and is using the Virginia Clean Energy Act and that Act’s Mandatory Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard Program to get SCC permits to bring the power ashore.

For that the entire federal government the fishing and maritime industries the national defense and the Virginia State Corporation Commission are lashed to the helm.

Wind industry and the Greens vs. the Coast Guard — no contest. The Coast Guard conducted a study into broader issues with wind farms offshore of the U.S. coasts; particularly how wind projects are sited within shipping lanes and safe operating clearances for vessels traveling past turbine towers.

The Coast Guard’s Atlantic Coast Port Access Route Study (ACPARS) as reported by the Checks and Balances Project a not-for-profit transformed into a spokesperson for the wind industry concluded that:

After five years of delay the U.S. Coast Guard finally released a study that concludes commercial shipping off the Eastern Seaboard is incompatible with a proposed offshore wind energy industry – despite the fact that Europe has successfully integrated the two for more than a decade. The Obama Administration has promoted the development of offshore wind energy since 2009. In September 2015 the Administration held a Summit on Offshore Wind with federal agencies. Yet though the Dept. of Homeland Security participated the U.S. Coast Guard of which it is a part has sailed in a different direction. The Atlantic Coast Port Access Route Study (ACPARS) released on March 14 2016 focuses on what its authors assert are dangers from offshore wind farms to shipping even going so far as to say that offshore wind energy could be an impediment to American energy independence. The study calls for dramatically limiting space for wind energy installations on the Outer Continental Shelf and even recommends removal of blocks from currently leased areas.

The attacks were swift brutal and effective a testimony to the political clout of the Greens.

ACPARS which in an act of contrition has disappeared from the Coast Guard’s web site showed that only one of the BOEM lease areas in 2015 was squarely in the middle of a high-density shipping lane. If you have not already guessed which one see the first map above.

The Greens through the Obama Administration beat the Coast Guard into submission because of ACPARS broader findings. They don’t care about CVOW per se.

But it is the one Dominion wants.

The shore transmission system. Another concern is the substantial increase in energy to the coastal transmission system. Offshore wind will add an enormous amount of power to the existing grid and the current grid must be modified to handle the influx.

When it comes to integrating the resulting influx into the power grid Dominion will need to construct new facilities to handle what the industry calls euphemistically “the uptick in load.”

The power will come ashore at the state military reservation on the coast and be transported to Naval Air Station Oceana and finally terminate at Dominion’s existing substation at Naval Auxiliary Landing Field Fentress in Chesapeake.

One wonders it there are to be complications or risks in that plan.

Game changer – floating turbines. The U.K. earlier this year in partnership with industry increased funding to its Floating Offshore Wind Demonstration Programme to accelerate deployment not R&D into such sources. The UK already has eleven projects it has deemed successful.

The UK is already home to the world’s largest deployment of offshore wind however floating turbines which can be deployed in deeper waters than conventional turbines will boost energy capacity even further by allowing wind farms to be situated in new areas around the UK coastline where wind strengths are at their highest and most productive.

It is the near-term availability of that technology that is driving lobstermen from the Gulf of Maine.

Floating turbines make the East Coast BOEM lease areas map obsolete.

That map was limited to wind areas that were of the right bottom depth to support towers. Like the ones that Dominion plans to build. At the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay.

Dominion asserts to the State Corporation Commission that it must have CVOW power ashore to supply power at night when the solar farms are impotent. That it must under the Act and can under its assumptions use it to provide power to the 600000 customers they estimate it will serve at peak power generation presumably including Hampton Roads military installations.

It can provide that power when the wind does not blow. Or when it blows too hard in a Nor’easter. When maintenance and repair are necessary. When ultimately replacement is necessary after what Dominion hopes will be 30 years. These are not perpetual motion machines.

Dominion testifies that batteries will store energy for those contingencies.

We wonder what they will testify in response to a question about what will happen when a military commander in time of conflict orders CVOW shut down to silence it. For the duration of the threat. However long that may be.

Has anyone ever told a broad swath of Virginians that entirely because of Northam’s Act even CVOW won’t provide nearly enough power? Below is what Dominion showed the SCC about capacity.

Alternatives. Since wind turbines are freed from their dependence on depths for the towers Dominion can either find a place less threatening for its own floating turbines or buy wind power from those that can.

Virginia is also blessed to sit adjacent to by far the largest proven natural gas reserves in the nation and some of the largest in the world — those in West Virginia.

Virginia can join the natural gas pipeline wars in favor of those pipelines.

With the looming Dominion power gap national defense and reliable power as front-line issues and floating turbine technologies to satisfy their green base’s desire for offshore wind power Virginia’s two senators can join with West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin to block further related appropriations until:

Gas pipelines to Virginia’s Atlantic Coast and Southern Virginia are mandated in federal law; or CVOW is eliminated from the list of available offshore wind turbine areas; or Both.

Or they can tell us why they will not.

Such a move will fill not only the nighttime need here but also fill the capacity gap that Dominion so clearly describes.

Observations and Recommendations for Approaching Federal Milestone. CVOW construction start awaits the BOEM Record of Decision for the Construction and Operations Plan (COP) in Q2-2023.

This article is filled with information and unanswered questions that argue for a no on that decision.

The development and operational success of floating wind turbines has made the current map of government-approved locations for offshore wind turbines obsolete.

But make no mistake. I argue that the location proposed for CVOW violates current law regardless of floating wind turbine technology.

Section 8 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1337) as amended by SEC. 388. requires:

“(F) protection of national security interests of the United States; and (J) consideration of–

(i) the location of and any schedule relating to a lease easement or right-of-way for an area of the outer Continental Shelf; and (ii) any other use of the sea or seabed including use for a fishery a sea lane a potential site of a deepwater port or navigation;”

Three observations:

If the lease location at the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay through which the warships and logistical vessels of Atlantic Fleet pass does not qualify as a threat to the national security interests of the United States then the words in the law are meaningless. The fact that the wind farm in that location with the noise it puts in the water and the proximity of sea lanes and the world’s largest naval base will attract both potentially hostile and hostile naval vessels including submarines is unchallenged. The open question is whether we can defend against them the level of effort it will take to do so and how Dominion will deal with the prolonged shutdown that such operations would require. The unanswerable question already asked in the law is why BOEM would complicate the defense of that strategic location in the first place. That site will be identified and published as a hazard to navigation. Finally BOEM need not consider the effects of this and some other identified locations on “potential” deepwater ports. Consider the ports that already exist on both coasts.

A federal judge and the appropriate committee of the new House of Representatives will ask three questions of BEOM. So I will:

Is this specific location critical for the energy security of the United States? Are there viable alternatives? Does this specific location compromise the national security interests of the United States by requiring dedicated military effort to account for its strategic location?

If the answer to the first question is “no” and the second and third are “yes” BOEM must withdraw and update the current lease area maps to make the changes required by existing law.

The first step will be to deny the construction permit cancel the lease currently held by Dominion and remove that location from the map.

The Virginia General Assembly. Construction awaiting federal permission and with it the biggest costs to Virginia rate payers has not begun in earnest.

But Ralph Northam’s Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) (the Act) represents Dominion’s entire justification before the State Corporation Commission for this abomination.

That is vulnerable to General Assembly action. And should be foreclosed by such action.

Bottom line. Others will do what they can to prevent federal approval.

Virginia’s General Assembly can amend the Virginia Clean Energy Act to make illegal the bringing ashore in Virginia of power from the CVOW.

That will end the madness of CVOW.

And must.

Update Dec 27 at 12:20 AM. Updated “Approaching Federal Milestone” with arguments I will use in a letter to BOEM in conjunction with its review of the final approval of construction of CVOW.

America is one of the world's most industrialized regions with the largest economy in nominal terms. This also makes it one of the world's largest consumers of electricity ranking second only to China through 3.9 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2021. In terms of sources of energy consumption petroleum and natural gas account for the largest sources and renewable energy ranks in third place. Sector wise industrial transportation and electrical power use are the largest electricity consumers in the U.S. and natural gas is the most widely used production source according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Courtesy of some of the best educational institutions in the world the U.S. is also leading the charge in researching innovative mediums for generating renewable energy. Not only is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) an American firm the world's first car maker to successfully mass produce an electric vehicle but researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are investigating methods to improve electricity generation through waves and the Sun as well as new mediums to store electricity. While solar cells are common these days these materials are unable to tap the vast amounts of energy that the Sun beams down to the Earth. On this front MIT is searching for materials that are cost effective scalable reliable and efficient at the same time. To do this they are utilizing machine learning and rapid experimentation to quickly sift through materials in hopes that a new one will provide a breakthrough.

When talking about energy any discussion would be incomplete without nuclear power plants. There are two kinds of nuclear reactions fission and fusion. With the former atoms are split up to squeeze out energy from them. However the latter is vastly more powerful (and complex) since it requires squeezing the atoms together and the resulting energy is harnessed as power. Fusion is the Sun's primary energy source and all nuclear plants in the world use fission instead. In the area of fusion the U.S. federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California was able to generate more energy from a Hydrogen plasma bombarded with lasers than the electricity used in operating the lasers instead. This was a crucial breakthrough since fusion is the most efficient and cleanest source of power - even on the nuclear front as it does not generate any radioactive waste.

Additionally America also passed one of the most important pieces of legislation for renewable energy this year in form of the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill provides roughly $370 billion in government subsidies for clean power generation. This provides the incentive for even some of the biggest American energy companies to invest in the field. Finally global crude oil prices have injected fresh rigor into renewable energy production after they jumped to a whopping $139 per barrel earlier this year in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Today we'll take a look at the largest American energy firms with the top picks being Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE).

There is something about that no mans land time between Christmas and New Year that makes us look at the oven with distain and feel like out entire body will revolt in protest if we try to entertain the idea of cooking.

That ""something"" might just be the fact that many of us will have put in hours of work to get a lovely festive feast ready on the 25th and so a Christmas treat may be in order.

If you don't want to nibble on a leftover turkey and stuffing sandwich your mind might start wandering to the ease of ordering a pizza and wonder ""is Dominos open?""

Now each Dominos store will be able to set their own hours so it is worth checking out your local branch's social media pages for more information.

These hours are set based on what works for their store teams and local communities.

However a spokesperson told RSVP Live that the hours will vary on Christmas Eve and St Stephens Day.

""All Domino's stores will be closed on Christmas Day franchises will close at either 9pm 10pm or 11pm on Christmas Eve.""

""Certain franchises will open at 3pm on St Stevens Day and regular hours resume for all stores on New Years.""

The beloved pizza brand recently made two new additions to their menu that might be the perfect antidote to the delicious but ultimately mild-flavoured traditional festive fare - The Ultimate Spicy Sausage pizza and Loaded Wedges with Spicy Sausage.

Specially chosen by the flavour champions in the Domino’s Innovation Team the new ingredients are an adventure with every bite combining flavours like nduja sausage and sweet red jalapeños.

The monarch had been called to action in February after Kent was hit by the worst floods in living memory bringing havoc and unparalleled damage.

A severe European windstorm over the North Sea caused a storm tide flooding the coast up to 5.6m high overwhelming most sea defences.

The week after disastrous floods hit Kent in February 1953 the Queen crossed the Thames from Purfleet to Gravesend in a Port of London Authority launch to see the damage. She was the first reigning monarch to make an official visit to Gravesend in 95 years. She talked to so many stricken residents that she was two hours behind schedule by the time she set off for Erith and Belvedere

1957

Kent was struck by two disasters in 1957.

In November a blaze broke out at Oakwood Hospital in Maidstone resulting in the deaths of three firemen.

And the following month two packed commuter trains collided outside Lewisham railway station killing 90 people - most of whom were from Kent - and leaving 176 injured.

Three firemen were among the six people killed and 15 badly hurt when a 120-foot ventilating shaft collapsed at Oakwood Hospital in Maidstone in the early hours of November 29 1957. The tower collapse came after a fire broke out at the mental hospital. Some 350 patients were evacuated. Pictured is the funeral procession through the town

CHARLOTTE N.C. – Duke Energy is crediting its customers’ energy conservation with helping keep the lights on for everyone on Christmas Day and is asking customers to continue implementing simple conservation measures until 10 a.m. Monday Dec. 26.

“Extremely cold temperatures combined with increasing customer demand has strained the electric grid across the country” said Jason Hollifield Carolinas Storm Director. “We are grateful for our customers who saved energy this morning and we are asking them to conserve energy again tonight through tomorrow morning.”

As businesses open on Monday morning and people begin returning to the workplace during this time of sustained frigid temperatures the company projects an increase in customer demand that could require rotating outages again on Monday.

“Our Duke Energy crews have been laser-focused on restoring power to our customers” said Hollifield. On Friday high winds caused outages throughout the Carolinas. On Saturday the extreme temperatures prompted energy interruptions in the region to maintain overall energy grid reliability. “We’ll be ready to respond to whatever the weather brings tomorrow morning. But we are optimistic that with the ongoing energy conservation of our customers we can avoid having rotating outages again.”

There are several ways customers can reduce energy consumption to help maintain an adequate supply for the region:

Select the lowest comfortable thermostat setting and bump it down several degrees whenever possible.

Avoid using large appliances – this means appliances with a three-pronged plug such as dishwashers ovens and dryers – during high-demand periods like early winter mornings.

Shift non-essential activities like laundry to late evening hours when power demand is lower.

Charge electric vehicles overnight.

If you have an electric water heater limit the use of hot water as much as possible.

Governor Roy Cooper is calling on Duke Energy to provide more information about the utility company's decision to implement rolling outages this past weekend during some of the coldest Christmas holiday weather in decades.

In a tweet Monday morning Cooper wrote: ""Duke Energy assures me NC is in the clear now. But I'm deeply concerned about people who lost power and who didn't get notice about rotating outages. Grateful for those who conserved energy. I've asked Duke for a complete report on what went wrong for changes to be made.""

""When we made the difficult decision to take these temporary outages they were done in a fairly fast order. So that work happened at a pace that didn't allow us to be as proactive in our communications as we'd typically be on other types of planned outages. This was sort of an emergent event. So I would say we did not get to communicate as well as we would like to with customers on the front end but we did try to provide information when we could during the event. And I think there's opportunities for us there to go back and look at that and see are there other things that we can do going forward to help improve that process just as will look at this entire event to figure out what things can be added to our plans and our processes to help either avoid this in the future or to improve that process"" said Duke Energy spokesperson Jeff Brooks.

Duke Energy e-mailed customers Monday afternoon shedding more light on the decision to institute outages.

Heavy rains in the Triangle Thursday saturated the ground ahead of high winds Friday which let to knocked over trees and branches causing power outages. During that time temperatures dropped leading to higher energy usage. Since other areas of the country were also experiencing high usage rates Duke Energy was unable to import power from elsewhere leading them to institute rolling outages.

""They help to protect the grid from a potentially larger and uncontrolled outage that could potentially happen if you don't manage the grid properly"" said Brooks.

The bulk of outages related to the storm were addressed by Saturday with Duke Energy sharing Monday there was no further need for rotating outages. Brooks explained the process of how specific areas are identified for such outages.

""We look for where we have pockets of electricity that we can pull from and then where do we have gaps that we need it"" Brooks said.

Duke Energy used solar energy which played a role in aiding power generation Friday during the initial wave of outages.

""We are in a time of transition. There's a lot of things like battery storage coming online very fast. But we're talking about a big system that's been built over decades if not approaching a century at this point. So it's going to take time to transition. The climate's changing how we use power is changing"" said Dr. Christopher Galik a Public Administration Professor at NC State.

Galik explained utility companies are focusing on diverse energy sources including renewables.

""We had a paper actually on this just recently where we were doing some research into better planning for what's called 'winter-peaking.' It's when you have your peak events your greatest energy consumption in the winter as opposed to when it's really hot on a summer afternoon. This is all changing too. So I think it's a matter of not only looking at these other generational sources but also trying to do a better job planning from local to federal in how to make everything work together"" Galik said.

He added customers can also play a role in reducing their own energy usage.

""Something as simple as weatherization I think is really important. Simply putting more insulation or sealing gaps"" said Galik.

North Carolina's Electric Cooperatives suggested temporary measures such as delaying the use of large appliances like dishwashers and dryers lowering your thermostat by a few degrees and turning off unnecessary lights can also reduce usage rates.

Shoppers stopped by Triangle home improvement stores both in anticipation of this recent weather stretch and in response as they prepare this winter.

""With the power outages over the past few week we have seen a high uptick in generators"" noted French Ratliff Store Manager of The Home Depot in Knightdale.

""Whenever we get a cold spell storm's coming through we always see people coming in for general things to stay warm so generators are one of our biggest asks any sort of heater-device"" added Brandon Dazarm a Department Supervisor with the Lowe's in West Raleigh.

That includes honing in on outside energy sources and efficiency.

""We make sure that we have fire pits gas-powered wood-powered we have wood to burn as well"" Ratliff said.

""They want to keep as little heat as escaping as possible so what they can do to lower the heating bill electric bill especially in today's day and age"" Dazarm added.

Get the news first in your inbox by signing up here.

California utility regulators last week adopted new rules sought by utility companies that reduce what rooftop solar owners get paid for electricity they send back to the grid. Will North Carolina be next?

Charlotte-based Duke Energy hopes so. Last year's state energy reform law requires regulators to revise rooftop solar rates. So in November 2021 the state's major utility asked North Carolina regulators to approve its proposed new rules for what's known as ""net metering."" That sparked a year-long battle with solar advocates and installers over the new rules which would not only reduce payments but also add an extra monthly fee for anyone who installs solar panels on their home.

Last week Duke and several industry groupsfiled a joint proposed order for North Carolina Utilities Commission approval. Opponents filed their own orders and briefs in hopes of persuading regulators to reject or at least delay a decision. The fight could be decided in 2023.

Solar advocates say Duke’s proposal would make solar less attractive cost customers with rooftop solar systems more and increase the length of time it takes for people who invest in solar panels to recoup their investment.

Right now solar panel owners whose systems produce more electricity than they need get credits on their bills equal to whatever they pay for electricity. Under the proposed changes those monthly credits would be lower and would vary according to the time of day and electricity demand. And homeowners would be charged an extra $10 monthly fee if they add solar. Duke says the changes would better align payments with the cost of electricity.

Net metering and rebates have been important incentives driving growth in North Carolina's solar industry. But in recent years utilities across the country have tried to roll back these incentives - with some success. It's not difficult to see why. If too many consumers generate their own electricity demand will fall and so will the need for expensive centralized power plants. (And those plants are where Duke makes most of its money since it sells electricity to customers at cost.) In a national campaign utilities and pro-utility groups have argued that net metering is unfair to customers who don't have solar.

That's how Duke Energy CEO Lynn Good put it at the company's annual meeting in May.

""We need to pay at a fair and reasonable rate so that not only the customer who generates the power but the customers who benefit from power are paying a fair amount"" she said.

But some environmental groups solar owners and installers have objected. They say Duke's plan would slow adoption of solar energy and make it harder for the state to meet its climate goals. Meanwhile North Carolina's 2017 law House Bill 589 required an ""investigation of the costs and benefits of customer-sited solar."" Duke says it has provided that information but the groups say Duke's in-house study was ""flawed"" and doesn't comply with the law.



Attorney general's office objects

North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein has also objected in multiple filings including one last week. Back in March his office called for postponing consideration of the plan to allow time for further analysis of what role rooftop solar should play in meeting the state's goal for reducing carbon emissions from energy production. State law requires a study of rooftop solar's costs and benefits.

Nobody at the attorney general's office was available for an interview this week but the office said in a statement: ""Our office believes that Duke hasn’t appropriately studied the benefits of customer-sited generation and its proposed net metering rates don’t take those benefits into account including the carbon-reduction benefits of rooftop solar.""

""It's important that rates fairly compensate people who installed solar energy to support the transition to clean energy. As it stands Duke’s rates don’t take into account all of the factors they should consider to ensure customers who install solar are fairly compensated and customers who don’t aren’t unfairly penalized with higher rates"" the statement said.

Duke has won the support of some large installers and solar industry groups by agreeing to slow the transition to new rules which would help existing solar owners. Last week's proposed order was filed jointly with the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association Vote Solar Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and the Solar Energy Industries Association.

Among other things that agreement would create a 15-year ""bridge rate"" for some current solar owners and those who install solar by the end of 2026. That bridge rate would be lower than the current one-to-one net-metering rate but still above the final rate. And it would be available to only a limited number of customers each year. The deal also lets Duke proceed with its original plan to ultimately trim payments and add a new monthly fee for solar users.



Opponents keep fighting

But other installers and rooftop solar advocates are still fighting the idea. In a March letter to the governor attorney general and regulators 15 installers wrote that their own calculations show Duke's plan would reduce the value of a home solar investment by 25% to 35%. They worry that could make it difficult for solar owners to pay off loans to buy solar panels.

“Duke’s proposed changes would significantly increase the time required to pay back my initial solar system capital investment"" Donald Oulman of Durham a home solar owner said in a statement last week. ""No corporation should have the right to change the value of an individual homeowner’s investment after the purchase is made.”

Oulman was one of the parties to anotherjoint filing last week at the utilities commission.Others included the Environmental Working Group NC WARN Sunrise Durham 350 Triangle 350 Charlotte the NC Climate Solutions Coalition and the NC Alliance to Protect Our People and the Places We Live. They also called for a formal cost-benefit study of rooftop solar before any change in rates.

Duke Energy spokesman Randy Wheeless says Duke is paying too much for electricity from solar owners.

""If you're paying a retail price for solar every time you get it a lot of times it's not really worth that. So you're overpaying people to generate solar at the detriment of other people who are saying 'Wait I don't get that same benefit.' So we're just trying to come up with something that is fair to the solar customer and to the non-solar customer"" Wheeless said this week.

For now the utilities commission is busy working on the carbon plan which is due Dec. 31. It's not clear when regulators might turn their attention to the net metering changes.

You can read all filings in the case at NCUC.net.



More about the carbon plan

State regulators have spent much of this year reading filings and comments and holding public hearings on Duke's proposed carbon plan. Last year's N.C. energy reform law requires the commission to draft a plan by the end of the year for how Duke Energy will eliminate carbon emissions at power plants to meet the state's climate goals. Regulators are expected to issue an order by next Friday. Read more in my Dec. 21 report ""NC energy regulators face a choice with Duke carbon-cutting plan: How fast and how far to go?""

(WECT) - Cold weather combined with high winds heading into the Christmas weekend led to problems for customers of Duke Energy with thousands being left in the dark during some of the coldest days of the year. Rolling blackouts were scheduled by the power company leaving some without power for hours in an effort to prevent even larger outages.

Jeff Brooks has worked for Duke Energy Progress for years and says during that time he’s never seen something like this happen but the combined factors are what led to the inconvenience for many.

“We had a windstorm that came in that created significant outages on Friday and that was a main focus just from physical damage to the system. But there was also the extreme cold temperatures that we had going into the weekend” he said.

Rolling blackouts are not common but they can help protect the power grid and prevent overloading the system causing even more problems.

“The idea behind those outages is that we can take a temporary controlled outage that will help to avoid a potentially larger outage that affects more customers for a longer period of time” Brooks said.

Fortunately for customers the weather is warming up and Brooks said these outages shouldn’t be needed in the coming days.

“We’re looking at as typical North Carolina weather goes 70 degrees by the end of the week. So we’re not going to be in a situation where we we have to deal with this” he said.

On Monday Governor Roy Cooper expressed his concerns with the outages and posted a statement on Twitter.

“Duke Energy assures me NC is in the clear now. But I’m deeply concerned about people who lost power and who didn’t get notice about rotating outages. Grateful for those who conserved energy. I’ve asked Duke for a complete report on what went wrong and for changes to be made” he wrote.

“I always kind of felt like my path was such a random existence until Chemours” Donovan said. “That’s when I realized these three skills have been incredibly useful.”

Donovan just so happened to have created the perfect skillset when reporting by the StarNews in 2017 revealed that two chemical giants Chemours and DuPont had been contaminating the area with toxic chemicals for nearly 40 years.

PFAS or per- and polyfluorinated substances are a group of chemical compounds manufactured at Fayetteville Works a chemical plant outside Fayetteville. The facility sits on the banks of the Cape Fear River and for more than 30 years Chemours and DuPont released untold amounts of PFAS compounds into the air groundwater and river contaminating the drinking water to approximately 500000 North Carolinians.

Background:The GenX water crisis began 4 years ago. Here's a recap of the key moments so far

Fear erupted when the scope of the contamination was first revealed. There were many questions and few answers. The community needed someone with a detailed understanding of government to lobby elected officials an eye for marketing to raise awareness and a knack for organizing to rally residents.

That’s when Donovan realized she was uniquely equipped to help. Since then Donovan’s become a leading advocate both here in North Carolina and nationally on the issue of PFAS and the damage this relatively unknown class of chemicals can have on communities if not properly managed.

A miraculous gift

Donovan and her husband David moved to Leland in 2009 from Charlotte. Donovan was seven-months pregnant with the couple’s twin boy and girl at the time.

Donovan who’s originally from Florence South Carolina had spent the past decade in corporate marketing. She worked for the world’s largest printing and coding technology companies.

“I put my career on hold to take care of the twins and adjust to living in a new town and all the things that come with that” Donovan said.

Three years into the family’s time here at the coast Donovan and her husband learned David had developed a brain tumor. David was slowly losing his vision and after consulting with experts doctors discovered a tumor in David’s skull base. They recommended David have the tumor removed immediately.

Months later the couple returned to the surgeon’s office for a follow-up exam. Doctors cautioned the pair that David’s vision loss would likely be a permanent consequence of the tumor. Yet when David’s vision was checked it was perfect.

“David did the eye exam and he had perfect 20-20 vision” Donovan said. “The surgeon was like ‘That's not me. That's God.’”

The moment humbled Donovan. It felt as though her family had received a gift greater than they probably could ever understand or repay she said.

“It really stuck with me and where I wanted to go in my life” Donovan said. “I didn’t want to get back into the corporate world. I wanted to focus on ministry work.”

Fighting America’s chemical makers

It was while Donovan was working as the director of a youth ministry program in Wrightsville Beach that the GenX crisis began.

Donovan began to fear Chemours and DuPont could’ve contributed to her husband’s close call five years earlier and the various ailments affecting the children in her youth program she said. “Maybe this is it” she thought.

“These students were just offering some really heavy prayers” Donovan said. “Half of the kids’ parents or siblings had severe medical problems. I just remember thinking that it wasn't like this when I was growing up in South Carolina. It just didn't seem normal.”

Research from North Carolina State University have found PFAS compounds in the blood of many Wilmington and Fayetteville residents at quantities higher than the national average. Blood samples collected by NC State’s GenX Exposure Study indicated most of the 1000 participants in the study face a greater chance of developing adverse effects such as cancer issues with infant and fetal growth and other health conditions.

Donovan felt she had to get involved. “This is huge and it requires attention” she said. As a result Donovan joined Clean Cape Fear as a co-founder in 2017 beginning her years’ long fight against Chemours and DuPont.

Clean Cape Fear is a grassroots community group working to protect the area from PFAS contamination and hold polluters and government agencies accountable. In the months after the crisis began Clean Cape Fear worked to get credible information out to the public and provide filtration systems to schools so children could get access to drinking water that wasn’t tainted by PFAS.

“Our focus is to just get existing nonprofits advocacy groups and elected leaders to come together and keep focus on this topic to keep holding companies accountable to make sure that we get help studies and sure that the responsible parties pay for the cleanup not us” Donovan said.

Before Chemours or DuPont Donovan’s life was focused on her family. Taking her kids to school setting up playdates and preparing meals – traditional housewife activities Donovan said. These days she’s up late answering emails attending meetings and conferences testifying before committees and doing just about anything she can to prevent the GenX Crisis from being forgotten.

Helping plan a national conference on PFAS was among those many tasks this summer. Donovan was part of the planning team for the third National PFAS Conference which was hosted in downtown Wilmington last summer. It was at that conference that the EPA announced new health advisories for GenX and a small number of other PFAS which tainted the Cape Fear River not far from where the conference was taking place.

“That was a full circle moment to go from five years ago sitting in my house going holy cow what does this mean to having the EPA actually unveil health advisories in this town"" Donovan said.

Keeping the pressure on

The fight to bring the GenX crisis under control is only just beginning. It took two years for the state to get a court order to force Chemours to start testing and providing safe drinking water to those with contaminated drinking water wells in addition to various improvements they were forced to make to the Fayetteville Works facility.

Well testing is ongoing and Chemours is still working to control releases.

Beyond the consent order multiple lawsuits by the state of North Carolina public utilities municipalities and various class-action lawsuits have been filed against Chemours and DuPont. However any damages if they’re awarded could be years away.

“I have to remind myself that this is not a sprint this is definitely a marathon even though I frickin’ hate running” Donovan said.

“Where I do find sustainment through this is reminding myself to look at where we actually have come even though five years feels like a long time” Donovan said. “We have changed the narrative on discussions at the national level about PFAS. We're no longer just talking about PFOA or GenX we're actually talking about the whole class of chemistry.”

Donovan never imagined she’d be battling corporations and government agencies and planning national conferences. She never imagined speaking to large groups organizing protests or even having the understanding of biochemistry that she now has (Donovan hated chemistry and science class when she was in school).

In addition to the work Donovan continues to do at the national level she and Clean Cape Fear have set up three milestones they’re striving to achieve with the GenX crisis. The organization wants to end all PFAS exposure get access to comprehensive health studies so residents can understand the risks they face and continue to hold polluters accountable for the damage they cause.

“It's provided me the opportunity to see that when you feel like you're presented with an impossible challenge something as impossible as a multi-billion-dollar chemical company that has all the resources all the power that with the snap of a finger can change the existence of this region… just because they have the money that doesn’t necessarily mean they have the power” Donovan said.

The Commonwealth Group bought Chestnut Run Plaza a nearly 94000-square-foot office building originally designed for DuPont for about $18.5 million earlier this month according to county land records. It is the largest office sale in the state this year according to Delaware Business Times records and translates to a cost of about $195 per square foot. Chestnut Run Plaza adds to a portfolio of New Castle County office buildings for Commonwealth which also includes One River Place in the Riverfront that is home to AAA.

The seller was Miami-based LNR Partners the world’s largest commercial mortgage special servicer which acquired the office building amid a particularly acrimonious foreclosure on the building then-owned by Commonwealth in 2017.

The Class A three-story building is currently fully leased and home to tenants like home health care provider Bayada business services giant CSC global IT and business consultancy Tata law firms like Bifferato Gentilotti and Allen & Associates and accounting tax and business advisory giant BDO. A small 5000-square-foot space is reportedly becoming available for lease in January though.

“We are thrilled to have the opportunity to purchase the property. It is a Class A office building in a prime location” Keith Quinn director of leasing and management for Commonwealth told Delaware Business Times.

After acquiring the property for $8.6 million in 2017 LNR will reportedly see a sale-to-sale return of nearly $10 million on the property after replenishing the tenants in the building.

The property was put to auction a few months ago with a $5.7 million starting price meaning it’s likely that Commonwealth faced some other competitive bids in seeking to regain the property. Chestnut Run Plaza reportedly produced an annual net operating income of about $1.7 million according to the auction listing.

Built in 2004 the office building was home to neighboring DuPont for about a decade. After it left the property however Commonwealth and LNR fell into dispute over contract lengths for several other tenants to help replenish the space. Eventually LNR forced a foreclosure through the courts to take ownership.

Chestnut Run Plaza now faces a very different opportunity however as it lies between two major redevelopment projects. To the south MRA Group of Pennsylvania is investing $500 million to reimagine the aging Chestnut Run labs into an innovation campus and has already attracted major tenants in DuPont Solenis and Prelude Therapeutics. To the north local developer Pettinaro has razed the old DuPont campus at Barley Mill to build a new mixed-use project featuring more than 100 residential units new offices and a number of retail storefronts anchored by the state’s first Wegmans supermarket.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd2Vnb3R0aGlzY292ZXJlZC5jb20vbW92aWVzL25leHQtZ29hbC13aW5zLXJlbGVhc2UtZGF0ZS1jYXN0LXBsb3QtYW5kLW1vcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Next Goal Wins' release date cast plot and more,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='wegotthiscovered.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /movies/next-goal-wins-release-date-cast-plot-and-more/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021225E9D900>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd2Vnb3R0aGlzY292ZXJlZC5jb20vbW92aWVzL25leHQtZ29hbC13aW5zLXJlbGVhc2UtZGF0ZS1jYXN0LXBsb3QtYW5kLW1vcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd2Vnb3R0aGlzY292ZXJlZC5jb20vdHYvaGFybGV5LXF1aW5uLXNlYXNvbi1mb3VyLXJlbGVhc2Utd2luZG93LWNhc3QtYW5kLW1vcmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Harley Quinn' Season Four Release Window Cast and More,"One of the most popular shows that has established a healthy position within the DC comic book world is Harley Quinn. From humor to insane violence two things that fans of any genre of show or movie can agree are important Harley Quinn has it all.

Adding on to this is the fact that Harley figures out that she is attracted to girls and even gets a girlfriend in the third season. This kind of representation has made the show a staple in the LGBTQ+ community. This is what fans can expect in the fourth season of Harley Quinn.

When will the fourth season be released?

During a trailer for the upcoming year HBO Max revealed that the fourth season will be released at some point during 2023 however there were no specifics were given as to the exact date. The fourth season will probably give more of an insight into who Harley is especially after she vowed off her villain role.

She is confirmed to be working with the Bat Fam thus making her have to control her actions and really grow as a person. There will no doubt be moments during this season when she struggles but she will have a lot of positive influences around her to help guide her.

Not only will there be a fourth season but there will also be a Valentine’s Day special that will be titled Harley Quinn: A Very Problematic Valentine’s Day Special. HBO released a statement about the special that said “The special will feature Harley and Ivy celebrating their very first Valentine’s Day together while also revealing how the rest of the ragtag crew spends the gushiest mushiest most romantic day of the year.”

Who will be in the fourth season?

Kaley Cuoco will be back in the fourth season as the titular main character and star of the show Harley Quinn. Lake Bell will also be back as Ivy the love interest and girlfriend of Harley. Fans can also expect Alan Kudyk to return as Joker as well as continue to do other voices during the season as he has done before.

Another person who does multiple voices and will be back is Tony Hale. Hale will continue to be the voice of Doctor Psycho in addition to the characters he does from episode to episode. Fans can also expect to hear Ron Funches as King Shark.

The first three seasons have been very good so fans can expect the fourth to continue the trend.

This story was produced through a collaboration between KQED in California and Climate Central.

Jeff Hunerlach a building trades union leader based in Humboldt County doesn't represent any maritime workers — but he expects a windfall of new jobs for his members from two clusters of wind turbines planned on floating platforms 20 miles off the coast.

While the turbines are unlikely to generate power for another decade the transformation of 80 acres of waterfront land in Humboldt into a hub for offshore wind operators and their vessels is imminent following a federal lease auction earlier this month. Similar work will be needed in Morro Bay onshore from three clusters of wind turbines.

""The work starts now"" said Hunerlach district representative at Operating Engineers Local No. 3 and local leader of 16 affiliated locals representing a variety of trades laborers. ""For Humboldt this means growing the middle class.""

Joining the chorus of environmental groups that celebrated the results of the lease auctions were unions representing electricians laborers and other trades — groups that for decades were frequently at odds with the green movement.

Substantial new waterfront infrastructure will be needed at Humboldt and Morro Bay to bring electricity from offshore wind turbines onto shore where it will power homes electric vehicles and industry.

At the Humboldt port Hunerlach anticipates that hundreds of union workers will be employed during construction with additional permanent jobs once the facility is running. Statewide he expects that the number of jobs created to support the new industry will be in the ""tens of thousands.""

The wind farm development rights were secured by large energy companies already developing wind farms on the East Coast where shallower waters allow for the use of traditional tower-based designs. Some of the winning bidders are transitioning or expanding from fossil fuel to clean energy production.

The floating platforms would be located about 20 miles off the state's coast.



""On an overall basis for offshore wind we see the U.S. market as one of the top one or two markets globally that we'll be investing in over the next decade and a half"" said Sam Eaton a U.S.-based executive at RWE a German energy company founded more than a century ago that secured the rights to build one of the wind farms off Northern California.

""When we focused in on the floating offshore wind space California's option really put the U.S. right at the forefront"" Eaton said. ""It's one of the first to hit the kind of scale that we're talking about and sets up the Western part of the country extremely well to be a hub for the industry globally.""

Best wind potential

While offshore wind power is a significant component of energy industries in Europe and Asia just a handful of turbines are currently generating power in the U.S.

A belated offshore wind farming boom along the Atlantic Pacific and Gulf coasts is anticipated in the years and decades ahead aided by international technology and know-how. Offshore wind energy is also being considered for Hawaii.

Offshore wind farming off the West Coast is complicated by the closeness to shore of the steep continental shelf. Waters viable for wind farming are too deep for the towers that hold most offshore turbines in place worldwide. The wind farms off California will be among the first in the world to float on giant platforms tethered to the seafloor and connected to land through electrical cables.

Efforts to build out the new industry will create jobs while providing federal incentives for developers to invest in coastal communities where new infrastructure will be needed. The efforts are however creating clashes with fishing fleets fretful not only of losing hunting grounds but of broader impacts on their quarry from the new approach to renewables generation.

""We're going to throw billions of dollars into something that we don't really know what the impact is going to be"" said Dick Ogg a commercial fisherman of crab albacore black cod and rockfish. He's based out of Bodega Bay but chases salmon from the state's North Coast south to Morro Bay which is another quiet part of California where an infrastructure boom is planned to get electricity from offshore wind turbines to land-based power customers. ""We'd like to see a project that is smaller.""

Fishing fleets nationally are angry about what they say is a lack of consultation with them by wind developers and by the federal government with hundreds of lobstermen in Maine attending protests about plans there. Tribes too say their members are being ignored.

""We're asking developers to simply view us for what we are: sovereign nations"" said Frankie Myers vice chairman of the Yurok Tribe who for thousands of years have lived on the redwood coast and along the Klamath River in what is now northwestern California.

Yurok tribal leaders spoke with half a dozen potential developers in advance of California's offshore wind auction but Myers said they weren't consulted by RWE or the other auction winners.

Myers said the worst impacts would be visual viewed from sacred high country particularly at night during ceremonies that include prayers. But he said the tribe also worries about unknown effects of rapid development in what has long been a quiet region.

""The last thing we want to do is destroy the environment in the process of trying to save it."" Myers said. ""This gung ho approach of having a single-minded goal is exactly how that happens. We have to look at this. We have to weigh every step. That's what we do as tribal people.""

RWE's Eaton said the company had held off on engaging with groups like fishing fleets and tribes in California until it had won a lease at auction. ""We're prepared to begin those dialogues very soon"" he said.

Researchers at Princeton University modeled a variety of pathways that could see the U.S. reach net carbon neutrality by 2050 meaning the nation would stop being a net climate polluter by that point. Without offshore wind it would technically be possible to reach ""net zero"" by 2050 but that would be ""more expensive than tapping into the abundant strong wind potential that's right off our shores"" said Jesse Jenkins a member of Princeton's Net-Zero America project.

""The best wind potential in the country if not the world is off the Northern California and Southern Oregon coast"" Jenkins said. ""It's an important resource that the region is looking to tap into.""

While the Net-Zero America project didn't consider potential wave energy generation because it isn't yet commercially viable Jenkins said the heavy chop of the Pacific Ocean could eventually be used to produce this additional form of clean ocean energy — perhaps operating off the same floating platforms as wind turbines.

""There are several companies working to develop wave energy"" Jenkins said. ""It's very difficult to build things that can survive the pummeling of West Coast waves.""

A cornerstone of ambitious plans

State renewable energy mandates in California and elsewhere have for years spurred planning of offshore wind farming with the goal of replacing power plants that generate the pollution responsible for climate change. More recently the federal government under President Joe Biden has been working to open up additional offshore waters for potential leases and to eliminate development bottlenecks imposed by the pro-fossil-fuel Trump administration.

California air regulators have charted an ambitious path to dramatically reducing planet-warming emissions over the next two decades which Gov. Gavin Newsom has said will ""spur an economic transformation akin to the industrial revolution"" and create a ""pollution-free future.""

To hit clean energy targets that are among the most ambitious in the world California will have to foster the construction of renewable generating capacity faster than ever before. The state is relying on robust offshore wind development in this plan and it wants to see 5 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity installed by 2030 which would be roughly equivalent to the output of eight or 10 natural gas power plants. The goal quadruples by 2045.

California is working to overcome workforce and technological barriers that could hinder the new industry and it's banking on rapid global innovation to push wind farms into deeper waters.

""Floating platforms are going through a period of great innovation"" said Stephanie McClellan executive director of the nonprofit Turn Forward which aims to accelerate the build-out of offshore wind farms nationally. Gas-and-oil drillers already use floating turbines and some of those designs are being adapted for wind farming.

""We're starting to see a variety of different innovations a number of different designs"" McClellan said. ""We'll start to see which of these are going to rise to the top in terms of usage.""

While floating technology is essential for building wind turbines along California's coast it in many ways could turn out to be superior to the fixed-tower turbines that currently dominate the industry.

That's because building further offshore where floating technology would be required even along the East Coast and along other shallower coastlines reaches stronger winds while reducing potential conflicts with fishing fleets. It can also ease concerns of residents and tourism operators about impacts of wind farms on ocean views. ""There's higher wind speeds in deeper waters"" McLellan said.

Some environmental risks many benefits

Assessing the likely environmental impacts of floating wind generation is difficult ""because there's not an awful lot of it in the world"" said Andrea Copping an oceanographer at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. After spending a decade investigating likely impacts she said ""I think the risks are reasonably small and manageable.""

Because the turbines will be so far out to sea there would be fewer threats of turbine blades striking land-based birds and bats Copping said. And tethering of platforms to the seafloor should cause fewer harms than the installation of towers which require extensive pile driving that can harm whales and other wildlife by creating underwater booms.

""The more platforms you put out there you increase the risk incrementally with each one"" Copping said. ""If I have concerns at all it's probably looking 30 or 40 years in the future with many many things out there.""

Impacts aside some environmentalists are leery at the presence of fossil fuel companies in the growing offshore wind sector.

Shell is a joint-venture partner on a wind farm planned off the coast of New Jersey which is leading efforts on the East Coast to attract offshore wind farm manufacturing and other facilities to its shores. Other gas and oil giants like BP registered to bid for last week's auction though none emerged as auction winners.

Jeff Tittel a veteran New Jersey environmentalist and former president of the state's Sierra Club chapter points out that many of the wind developers setting up operations in the U.S. retain extensive fossil fuel operations which he says erodes trust. RWE for example operates natural-gas-fired power plants across Western Europe.

""I kind of get it that energy companies want to diversify like they used to be coal and then they went into oil and then they went into wind and solar"" Tittel said. ""Does that mean that they're willing to go to 100% renewable and put their other businesses out of business? That's why I say there's a trust issue.""

For unions working for fossil fuel companies is nothing new. What's new for them are vast workforce opportunities in a fast-emerging industry — one that's slowing the destruction of a livable climate instead of contributing to it.

""This is a climate change issue"" said Hunerlach the union official in Humboldt County. ""We're really excited to be able to be part of this historic new industry.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMivgFodHRwczovL3d3dy51bmlvbmxlYWRlci5jb20vdm9pY2VzL2xvb2tpbmdfYmFjay9hdXJvcmUtZWF0b25zLWxvb2tpbmctYmFjay10aGUtYmljZW50ZW5uaWFsLWhpa2Vycy1mcm9tLWNoaWNhZ28tcy1wbGF5Ym95LWNsdWItdG8tYS1oaXN0b3JpYy9hcnRpY2xlX2Q3MDFmYjk2LTAwN2QtNTg1Mi04OWM5LWI0NTgzNGEzNzZhMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aurore Eaton's Looking Back: The bicentennial hikers – From Chicago's Playboy Club to a historic Missouri jail,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMivgFodHRwczovL3d3dy51bmlvbmxlYWRlci5jb20vdm9pY2VzL2xvb2tpbmdfYmFjay9hdXJvcmUtZWF0b25zLWxvb2tpbmctYmFjay10aGUtYmljZW50ZW5uaWFsLWhpa2Vycy1mcm9tLWNoaWNhZ28tcy1wbGF5Ym95LWNsdWItdG8tYS1oaXN0b3JpYy9hcnRpY2xlX2Q3MDFmYjk2LTAwN2QtNTg1Mi04OWM5LWI0NTgzNGEzNzZhMC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000212252DF9A0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

There's no turning back for Corporate India in 2023 - the hybrid work model is here to stay.Companies across sectors including Tata Steel Marico  LTIMindtree Boston Consulting Group and Eaton intend to keep the hybrid work model going in the new year offering flexibility to employees to better maintain work-life balance Hybrid work fulfils both employer-employee needs said experts. Employees want flexibility but also in-person time with their teams colleagues and friends at work. Organisations want more people back in offices but recognise that the world of work has changed irrevocably- and employees can be more productive even while operating in flexible models ""Flipkart employees have been functioning in a hybrid model for the past few months now"" said Krishna Raghavan chief people officer Flipkart. ""We will continue to remain flexible in our approach and modify our model as needed - based on both employee needs and external factors.""In the manufacturing sector where the majority of employees are back in office Tata Steel plans to continue with the agile working model it had introduced for white collar employees during the pandemic. Blue collar employees are regularly coming to work.“We have seen a significant increase in the percentage of employees working from home as compared to the prepandemic era” said a Tata Steel spokesperson.LTIMindtree calls it the Yin-Yang model. It has steered away from a one-size-fits-all approach categorising all roles under different ‘personas’— client-office work-office hybrid and home-office—based on roles client-project requirements and personal preferences “The hybrid model is here to stay and it is unlikely that the industry will go back to fully working from offices all the time. The journey from here on will involve retaining what is best and fixing what isn’t. Like Yin and Yang the future productivity of teams and organisations will depend on striking the right balance between working from office and home” said LTIMindtree CHRO Manoj Shikarkhane.“As normalcy resumes our plan is to get back most of our workforce in the office in 2023. We plan to extend the Yin-Yang model to a wider employee base and actively advance the persona-based approach.”BCG has put in place various flexible and hybrid work models. “There is room for all working models to co-exist and companies that will be able to embrace flexibility in the way they work how they work what time they work will be able to attract engage and retain talent better” said Suresh Subudhi managing director and senior partner at BCG.A November survey by HP bore this out. It found that the hybrid model scores high among Indian employees 92% said it improves work-life balance 88% said it increases employee retention and 72% found it to be more productive.“For most employees there will be no going back to the daily commute and traditional nine-to-five workday but rather fluidity between remote and in-person work environments” says Arvind Usretay commercial leader India and South Asia at management consulting firm Mercer. “Having said so sectoral and job role-related differences will continue to remain.”Companies will invest further in perfecting their hybrid models and it will be interesting to see how they overcome challenges of trust collaboration inclusion and engagement said Mercer’s Usretay.“However the good news is that companies are now taking decisions based on nearly three years of data established structures and systems and equipment to support their employees aspirations and requirements” he said.Companies said they are also seeing more employees showing interest in returning to office – at least on some days of the week.A certain amount of physical interaction is critical for culturalisation and driving innovation said Marico CHRO Amit Prakash. It’s seeing more staff preferring to come back to the office.“We are currently in the process of evaluating the best work model for our workforce but are encouraging members to be in office” Prakash said. “At the same time we continue to offer flexibility.”Marico offers an option for location flexibility to employees based on roles and individual needs. It has helped the consumer goods company reach a larger and diverse talent pool.At most of power management company Eaton’s offices employees are currently working on a 3:2 basis — three days in and two days out of office. It has also seen an increasing number of employees keen to return to work.However the hybrid work trend is here to stay says Ashish Kapoor India HR director at Eaton. “Hybrid models allow employees to access remote and on-site working options and provide flexible hours that accommodate their lifestyles” he said."

In 2017 while working in childcare Hannah decided to try her hand at making soaps face masks and bath bombs at home.

“I was trying a couple of different hobbies like I tried refurbishing furniture and selling that on (Facebook) Marketplace” Hannah says.

“Then a friend said ‘You should make bath bombs from the kits you can buy online and see if you can sell them’.

“So I ordered the ingredients on eBay to make them myself” she says deciding on the name Bath Box for her company.

In demand

From there Ashton built the e-commerce site and Hannah posted on Facebook groups including Melbourne Gal Pals where she made her first sale.

Within six months her bath bombs were in hot demand after she used Facebook advertising and organic growth on Instagram to build her customer base.

“Our two-bedroom unit in Bentleigh was packed to the brim with bath bomb supplies” she says.

“I’d have to move packing peanuts off the bed at night to go to sleep.

“I’d wake up at 6am every morning and go to work (in childcare) then come back at 5pm and work until 2am filling orders then do it all over again.

“It became too much.”

After 12 months the business was booming - and Hannah quit her full-time job to focus solely on Bath Box.

Moving operations to a bigger warehouse the business expanded to selling luxury bath pillows and bath caddies.

And when the pandemic hit in 2020 sales surged again.

“I think people were looking for a way to spend time and relax in their own home so sales really took off for us” Hannah explains.

Five years from its inception the company has now made more than $6 million in sales.

But Hannah concedes she’s made a lot of mistakes along the way.

“My biggest learning from my business is knowing when to pivot if something isn’t working” she says.

“My business is my second baby so there are a lot of emotions involved but it’s important to recognise when you need to move on.

“I spent so much time and money on the face masks when they weren’t working for me.

“It’s important to be agile and to keep up with the trends so your business can keep evolving.

“In today’s society there is a big push to get rich quick but that’s not the reality.

“Running a business is hard work it’s dedication you need to stick with it and be consistent.”

While Hannah’s business now allows her to travel in luxury for months of the year with her son she has had to work hard to get to where she is.

“When I started Bath Box I had to make a lot of sacrifices” she says.

“You dedicate everything to your business.

“You can’t take time off or go to the movies with friends you have orders to fill and you’re responsible for that.

“Now I’ve got employees I’m also responsible for those families so I can’t just clock off at 5pm.

“But now the business is more stable I am so lucky to get to spend more time with my son and travel around the world while I’m working.

“I never imagined the business would grow to this scale so fast.

“I used to say if we made $100000 in one year I’d be thrilled but you always keep striving for that next goal.”

What is Project Delgue?

Started by The Hidden Palace community Project Deluge is described as an ongoing initiative to “archive and assess all of the items featured in a lot of video game development material that has been gathered over the course of many years.”

One of The Hidden Palace’s goals is to prevent the loss of historic game content including artwork development builds and source code. Project Deluge contributors collect prototypes test them for playability document each item and provide an overview of general differences and facts.

Initially they released almost 800 prototypes for PlayStation 2 games and then added over 500 prototypes for Xbox PlayStation Sega Dreamcast and Philips CD-i titles. So far Project Deluge has collected almost 5000 discs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL2xpZmVzdHlsZS5saXZlbWludC5jb20vc21hcnQtbGl2aW5nL2lubm92YXRpb24vbmVlZC1mb3Itc3BlZWQtdW5ib3VuZC1yZXZpZXctdGhpcy1yYWNpbmctZ2FtZS1zdHJ1Z2dsZXMtdG8taGl0LXRvcC1nZWFyLTExMTY3MjA0MzQ4NjE4OS5odG1s0gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vbGlmZXN0eWxlLmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9hbXAvc21hcnQtbGl2aW5nL2lubm92YXRpb24vbmVlZC1mb3Itc3BlZWQtdW5ib3VuZC1yZXZpZXctdGhpcy1yYWNpbmctZ2FtZS1zdHJ1Z2dsZXMtdG8taGl0LXRvcC1nZWFyLTExMTY3MjA0MzQ4NjE4OS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Need for Speed Unbound review: This racing game struggles to hit top gear,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL2xpZmVzdHlsZS5saXZlbWludC5jb20vc21hcnQtbGl2aW5nL2lubm92YXRpb24vbmVlZC1mb3Itc3BlZWQtdW5ib3VuZC1yZXZpZXctdGhpcy1yYWNpbmctZ2FtZS1zdHJ1Z2dsZXMtdG8taGl0LXRvcC1nZWFyLTExMTY3MjA0MzQ4NjE4OS5odG1s0gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vbGlmZXN0eWxlLmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9hbXAvc21hcnQtbGl2aW5nL2lubm92YXRpb24vbmVlZC1mb3Itc3BlZWQtdW5ib3VuZC1yZXZpZXctdGhpcy1yYWNpbmctZ2FtZS1zdHJ1Z2dsZXMtdG8taGl0LXRvcC1nZWFyLTExMTY3MjA0MzQ4NjE4OS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021225632380>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Lewis defeated longtime incumbent and fellow Democrat Lambert Boissiere III — a member of a prominent New Orleans political family who had heavy institutional support — and became the first openly LGBTQ person elected to a state-level seat in Louisiana.

Lewis ran on a progressive platform promising to push for expanding renewable energy codifying a “bill of rights” for utility ratepayers and prohibiting commissioners from accepting political contributions from companies they regulate such as utility giant Entergy Corp.

Lewis sat down last week for an extended interview with Verite discussing the election and his plans as a commissioner representing a district that stretches from Baton Rouge where he lives to New Orleans.

He also talked about what the seat means to residents of New Orleans where the City Council — not the Public Service Commission — is the primary utility regulator.

This transcript has been edited for length and clarity. You can listen to the interview here:

Verite: Just to get started I want to set the stage of this race that you entered. We had an incumbent who was on the commission for nearly two decades and had a lot of institutional support. And you entered this race as someone who was seen as a longshot initially. Could you explain what prompted your decision to run for this office?

Lewis: This is a real different time in Louisiana. People this summer saw their electricity bills the highest that they’ve seen in years. And we are now very prone to natural disasters that happen any given moment like the tornadoes we saw just two days ago.

But my response was after Hurricane Ida. Even though I lived on the western side of this district that didn’t see as much damage as other parts of the region from Hurricane Ida I was without power for five days. That prompted — plus the high bills — that there needed to be someone to be a stronger advocate to hold these companies accountable. And when I looked around I didn’t see anybody standing up cause it was going to be a long-shot campaign. I said “Look I just can’t keep talking about this in Twitter threads and text messages. Let’s step up and and put it in the ecosystem and see what happens.” And that was the catalyst of this race.

Verite: Going back to November during the primary: Your main opponent Lambert Boissiere was about 7 points shy of winning outright. You had 18%. Then we get to the December runoff and 18% is pretty close to what your margin of victory was. What changed between that November election and the December runoff?

Lewis: One of the things that we saw in that November primary was there was significant discontent with the incumbent. About 57% of all the people in the district voted against him. …

It was also about galvanization so we made sure that we had a robust ground game and that we were not leaving anything unturned. So we knew they were gonna spend a lot of money on TV and we weren’t gonna have the money to compete on TV. But we had enough money to run a robust texting campaign and GOTV and phone calls and direct canvassers…. We even won the incumbent’s own precinct [in the runoff]. That’s how much we spent time on targeting and voter engagement.

Verite: A lot of your campaign focused on support from the regulated utilities that Boissiere received. But there was also the Louisiana Democratic Party.

Over the summer they went against their usual practice and instead of endorsing a single candidate they endorsed all the Democratic candidates in the election. But later on we saw spending from the Louisiana Democratic Party going only to the Boissiere campaign.

Did you request support from the party? What is your impression of what happened with the Democratic Party this election?

Lewis: It has been a complete utter failure. As you mentioned the process was changed. Typically what we had is that the body itself would vote on endorsing or endorsing multiple people. In the spring they changed that rule. Now the executive committee would make a recommendation to the full body and the full body would vote that up or down.

I won the sole candidate from the executive committee. So the new rules that the party put in place we won by and won by a healthy margin. And so when it came down to ratifying the executive committee’s recommendation of me being the solely endorsed candidate the party changed the rules again via resolution and endorsed us all.

At that point in time there’s supposed to be communication. There was no communication. Actually the only reason I knew I was endorsed was because of the press release and the people in the room who were telling me the live things. And so the only way I found out about even some of this financial help for the incumbent was they accidentally sent one of the mailers to me. …

Then by the time we got to a process of them engaging me we were about two weeks out from the December election. And at that point I don’t think there was much trust there was much time. And so we didn’t engage any further about the services. They may say I didn’t take it up but it’s very hard to take up an offer that is given to you with the clock at two seconds left in the fourth quarter.

Verite: When you’re talking about sort of outside forces being involved that was also a criticism from Mr. Boissiere of your campaign. He attacked you frequently especially as we got toward the end over “dark money support” — nonprofit donations routed through a political action committee. The major one was Keep the Lights On PAC.

Feel free to address his support from the regulated utilities — but on the flip side is there an extent to which he has a point? We’re talking about money that originates with nonprofit groups in many cases that aren’t required to disclose their donors. …

Lewis: Campaign finance is a major question. It’s a problem.

We have way too much money in politics and it doesn’t really benefit the people. I’m a big proponent of public financing of campaigns. I wish we would go to that system but certainly that’s not the system that we live in. And so it’s this give and take between the theoretical world and the practical world. Right now the theoretical world doesn’t work.

The attacks were really hollow. When we talk about these dark money out-of-state interests let’s remember Keep the Lights On was a PAC that I didn’t coordinate with because I can’t by law that was developed with the Louisiana chapter. Louisiana has its own chapter of the Environmental Defense Fund that asks people to help them out.

When we talk about some of these other nonprofits — VOTE or the New Orleans Greater Housing Alliance or the Sierra Club — these are people in Louisiana saying “We need help here in Louisiana.”

It is a very different marker in my brain when we hear this line of attack because it’s not like just some random billionaire from New York picked a candidate and then funded them. I was someone who had been working with these groups for years been working in these communities for years. They have been on the ground for years. And we all believed in each other.

It’s very hypocritical to talk about that when you look at the campaign finance reports. I got three PAC checks to my campaign: the Sierra Club the Environmental Defense Fund and the Victory Fund PAC. That’s it.

: Lewis’ campaign finance reports show he received two additional PAC contributions. One for $5000 came from the Clean & Prosperous America PAC . The other for $500 came from the Communication Workers of America PAC. Boissiere’s campaign received 28 PAC contributions for the 2022 election — including contributions from committees representing Entergy Cleco Energy and AT&T — totaling $94000.]

The incumbent had the utility companies’ PACs had two PACs created for him because the utility companies hit their statutory limit of what they could fund his campaign with.

And then subsequently when they hit their limit there wrote a check for $10000 to the Louisiana Democratic Party to then send information from the party on his behalf.

What we are showcasing is when you give money to an upstart or just enough money — let’s be very clear he still out raised me by a mile — what we are seeing is that when you give money to other candidates and other candidates find a money stream to be viable they win. A PAC is not gonna give me a 20-point advantage over the incumbent. That tells you that we did the work and all we needed was a little bit of investment to make that work happen. For me this attack is all about power. It is that the Louisiana political establishment no longer has the ultimate grip on politics in the state because now they don’t control the money stream.

Verite: Let’s move past the election and discuss what you plan to do as a commissioner. You ran on a really ambitious platform. Given the makeup of the Public Service Commission — you’ll be one of two Democrats on there — what do you think you’re realistically able to accomplish as a commissioner and what will it look like working with the other commissioners?

Lewis: What people did not realize is that the incumbent who I unseated was more of the swing vote than one of the Republicans who represents an adjacent district. And so this is a very interesting opportunity. We saw this. [The PSC] had a meeting yesterday where one of the Republicans was the leading voice in pushing Entergy Louisiana on renewables. When you add another strong voice with [Democrat] Foster Campbell we now can create a three-member majority on the [five-member] council.

This is gonna be an opportunity where you really need someone to be vocal. Cause oftentimes the pressure or the internal communications changes when somebody is timid versus outspoken because now that pressure on the swing vote is — I may not have to be the voice but I can give the vote. But you can’t be the voice and the vote sometimes. My addition will relieve that because I will be very vocal.

I’ve been having meetings and briefings and getting ready to continue looking at this docket that was created on the customer’s bill of rights. Entergy and Cleco are just submitting their drafts of their [Integrated Resource Plans] where they are at least mentioning renewables. I have not read them fully. But as I’ve been advised they at least hint that they should be going that direction and now it’s time to start holding them accountable. So there’s gonna be a lot of opportunities to really hit the ground running in these first few months on all the initiatives that we talked about. And then we have a legislative session coming up. I already have a bill drafted and I’m talking to authors to follow up on corruption.

Verite: Speaking of a customer’s bill of rights what does that entail? What would you include in there?

Lewis: I do not morally believe we should be disconnecting people’s utilities. It is too life important. People’s medicine depends on that. That is something that I want to be very particular that we have the strongest rules possible on disconnections. But secondly it’s going to be examining these fees. We’ve heard this debate a lot in Louisiana that our utility rates are relatively low per kilowatt which is a true fact that I’m not denying.

But our cost in Louisiana what people spend on utilities is sky-high about 42% more than the average American. Let’s just look at one spot where I’m going to focus on which is late fees. Louisianans are paying about $16 per customer in late fees. The national average is around $5. That is unacceptable. And so the ratepayer’s bill of rights will be talking about that making sure we’re not keeping this lineage of excessive late fees that is basically pricing our people out in the state of Louisiana.

Verite: Can you talk about what else can be done from a regulatory perspective as it relates to the high cost of bills for ratepayers?

Lewis: This is about investments in renewable. We know our power grid right now is only around 2% renewable energy. So when we’re looking at those IRP plans we need to demonstrate and we need to see what is that transition? What are you doing? Because we know the cost of natural gas is skyrocketing. …

Secondly it is in hardening the grid as well. When we talk about these fees if the grid is unsustainable and unreliable and we have to constantly repair and maintain and harden it after every storm that burden of the cost is being shifted to the ratepayers. You’re having higher-than-normal natural gas rates no strong investments in renewable energy when solar is proving to be cheaper at the natural gas at this point. You’re having excessive late fees. And then you couple it with the storms. Now you’re having to harden the grid every year or two. You are now creating a catastrophe of utility costs going up every single year.

That’s part of where the regulatory process comes in. You can’t look at these things as one-offs. You can’t just vote for a hardening fee and not look at whether or not we are investing in renewable energy or we’re maintaining the grid. You can’t talk about the investments here and not talk about “Should we be rolling off some of these late fees and protecting ratepayers in this way?” All of that is in the regulatory control. How often do we review it in a comprehensive way versus an individual “I need a rate increase for X because of something and I’m only dealing with that issue not looking at the other five issues that will determine whether or not that rate increase is making or breaking something?”

Verite: What do you hope to propose as far as expanding renewable energy? What might deregulation look like in that space?

Lewis: I strongly believe Louisiana needs to really be on the forefront. That’s why I’m pushing that we go ahead and create and join the 37 other states with the renewable energy portfolio standard so we can start to look at all these questions. Cause everybody has questions about what is the duration what are the penalties what is the compliance process looks like? That’s what a portfolio standard is for is to set up that exact debate in those conversations. That is a place where I’m gonna be very strong as we talk about that.

With the investments that we’re seeing from the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the IRA there is a lot of federal money that can be matched in some of these investments. … We need to be ensuring that we are providing that information to our Louisiana families. But we’re also moving in a way and returning back to net metering so it’s beneficial to Louisianians to utilize them right? It’s this kind of this holistic policy approach for me about how net metering is going to be important to draw down federal funds then it’s gonna build sustainable housing. That’s the process.

Verite: The Public Service Commission is currently involved in a lawsuit over the Grand Gulf Power Station. How would you like to see that resolved and do you support more investment in nuclear in the region?

Lewis: I’m very pleased that the commission has not accepted the settlement. We need to negotiate a better deal for Louisianians. I know there’s been a lot of privileged conversation and executive items so I can only speak from what I’ve been able to see in the news thus far. … I’m very pleased to see that where my fellow commissioners have been publicly is also where I’m at at the moment. That’s an issue that hopefully once sworn in I can actually read some of the briefings and some of the confidential documents that have not been a part of the public record at this point.

In terms of nuclear I am not a big proponent of nuclear. We should be moving away from it. I know there’s conversations about nuclear in terms of hydrogen but that’s a very different debate in my eyes. But we don’t have too many nuclear power plants left in Louisiana. I know one I believe is in the process of actually closing down. I would say in terms of my personal views the status check right now nuclear is not something I’m gonna be a strong proponent of.

Verite: There were some groups during the election such as Voters Organized to Educate that had a focus on prison phone call charges which are regulated by the Public Service Commission. Can you speak to what incarcerated folks are currently being charged and what the PSC can do about prison call rates?

Lewis: Right now the average 15-minute phone call in our state is somewhere between $3 to $5. A person’s yearly income prior to being incarcerated in the state is around $20000. If you think about that 15-minute phone call you do it every single day of the year we are talking about a Louisianian spending over half of their income to talk to a loved one who happens to be incarcerated. That’s how predatory this practice is.

We’ve been trying to work on this. In 2005 there were some great reforms done with Securus because they were charging late fees that were not approved by the PSC. But sadly two months after that rule was passed the incumbent who I unseated issued a stay on that rule. A judge in 2015 ordered that because the PSC has not removed that stay the millions of dollars that Securus owes to Louisiana families cannot go out because the PSC has stayed the ruling.

Lewis appears to be referencing a 2012 order by the PSC to remove fees and surcharges which was stayed in early 2013. A 2015 PSC order  following the recommendations of an Administrative Law judge maintained the stay was still in effect.]

One of the first things we’re working on right now is: Can we remove that stay very fast to get that money back into the hands of Louisianians? That’s short-term but more long-term it is about reform. I want to follow some of the other states that have made incarcerated phone calls free. If we can’t make them entirely free maybe the first 30 minutes a week?

So many people in Louisiana have someone who is incarcerated. For too long Louisiana has incarcerated more individuals than any other place in the world. This is why this is an issue that is very important to our people … It helps with recidivism it is a tool of human interaction … We’re gonna do a lot of work on this. Me and Commissioner Campbell have already had some conversations and we’re gonna move very fast on bringing some immediate relief and then continue the work on a long-term fix.

Verite: You want to propose a rule that bans the acceptance of contributions from regulated industries. To what extent do you see that proposed rule going? Are you going to ban employees of regulated utilities from making those donations or LLCs they control? What about consultants and contractors? What does that look like and how would you envision enforcement for this?

Lewis: Those are places where we’re going to have to talk. I am leaving it on the table. The most important thing is the utility company’s PACs. That’s primary. …

This process is going to be twofold because the PSC does not regulate campaign finance. That is going to have to be a legislative fix that I’m engaging legislators with right now. But I do believe that PSC does have the authority to set rules for members of the body the same way that other executive branches can do where you can set your own internal rules. I’m going to be pursuing both a legislative fix that would help prospective and currently sitting [commissioners]. But even if we can’t then we should do the rule that if you are sitting on the PSC you can’t accept those at all.

Verite: Do you think you’ll get support for these efforts from other commissioners?

Lewis: It’s open. This election showcased that there is a different blood in our state when it comes to this issue. Our campaign was the district base but the issues we have elevated have sparked this conversation around the state. And these are places where members may have not known this. We’ve elevated the PSC to a different level. When you talk to people about knowing that the same utility company that has been raising your bill for the last few years and has been unworkable is regulated by five elected people and then they get to donate basically they’re getting rich off of your bill going higher and then they can take some of that profit and put it into the person that’s supposed to be checking you — it’s going to showcase a different level of engagement.

So I’m eager — I haven’t had a chance to really talk with my colleagues fully yet on this issue. But I think you’ll see some work especially on those who may be coming up for reelection cause it’s an issue they don’t want on their backs.

Verite: How do you envision your relationship with your constituents? What does the work look like as far as translating these really important but wonky issues to everyday people?

Lewis: This is the beauty of being a policy advocate by trade. This is what I’ve done for a living is take complex budgetary tax and public policy and then engage people. And so I’m going to take that organizer model that I’ve been working in and bring it to the PSC. That’s community meetings that’s town halls that’s engagement that’s newsletters that letting them know what’s happening in the meeting before. Oftentimes we have this kind of like convoluted one-way communication where it’s like I tell you all what I did at the meeting. Did I actually tell you when the meeting was and what is up at the meeting?

And so it’s going be a lot of upfront stuff like “In two weeks we’re gonna be discussing a rate increase. What are your thoughts?” You have to center yourself in community. That’s the race that we ran and that’s how we’re going to govern. The ability I’ve possessed over the years to take complex policy issues I’m going to bring that same skillset onto the PSC in a more fruitful way especially because we know so many people are now interested and they just need to know about it.

Verite: Let’s talk about the PSC’s relationship to the city of New Orleans. One of your biggest bases of support in this election was in Orleans Parish. Now as we know in Orleans Parish the PSC doesn’t regulate electric and gas. That falls to the New Orleans City Council. You’ve said in debates leading up to the election that you support the New Orleans City Council retaining that regulatory authority. Can you explain for people in New Orleans who may not be terribly familiar with this commission how it works and how regulation works? Why should this election why should this seat matter to people in Orleans Parish?

Lewis: It should matter because of the relationship between Entergy New Orleans and the relationship with Entergy Louisiana. They’re a subsidiary of Entergy Louisiana. If we are being very strong on Entergy Louisiana and its renewable energy or in processes around fixed billing for seniors and ratepayers that’s going to fall to Entergy New Orleans because that’s how the relationship works. But there’s also a lot of other issues. When we talk about Hurricane Ida and the transmission structure that fell down into the river that knocked off most of the power in the city of New Orleans that is a PSC regulatory entity because it is crossing jurisdictional lines.

And so there are a lot of times where yes your direct power your direct bills are not regulated by the PSC [but] there’s a lot of indirect policy that’s going to affect how high or low your bills are and whether or not you have services or not. So if we are pushing Entergy Louisiana to do more investments let’s say in burying the transition lines underground that’s going to fall back down to Entergy New Orleans. It’s a little bit of a tap-dance relationship. They coexist with each other and there are places of overlap.

Verite: We’ve seen instances where the New Orleans City Council was working in an official regulatory capacity on matters that the PSC was dealing with. Grand Gulf was an instance where we saw that recently. Are there ways that the New Orleans City Council as regulator of Entergy New Orleans could be working more closely on some of these matters with the PSC? What would those be toward? What ends?

Lewis: The City Council has been intervening in some of the dockets at PSC right now and I’m getting caught up to speed on exactly what their interventions were. But this is a place when it comes to investments in renewable energy this is going to be a conversation of energy efficiency. There’s a pilot program that was created under the PSC that was supposed to be a two-year pilot. It’s been eight years now. We have seen that dockets typically and rate cases move very slow. And so that relationship can build upon each other if the city council has moved on a very similar docket complementary to the PSC to doing something or vice versa.

I plan to attend many of the utility committee hearings for the New Orleans City Council even though I’m not a resident because I know their work is going to indirectly or directly impact my work. And so building that kind of communal presence also helps the public because there is an relationship there.

I was very clear with the folks in New Orleans. I’m not your direct regulator but the things that we do really impact you and can benefit you and so let’s do it together.

Verite: Getting back to something you said before — you mentioned Ida where we saw portions of the power grid that are regulated by the PSC having a direct effect on the city of New Orleans. A big part of your platform is strengthening that grid to avoid another situation like Ida where the entire city is out of power for two weeks. Could you get into specifics? What should be done and how does it get accomplished without what we’ve seen before which is raising rates for ratepayers?

Lewis: We’ll use the prime example of the securitization that’s before the PSC right now. There was a discovery where it looks like the state law for bond securitization does not require a utility company to pass 100% of the cost to the ratepayers. They started those discussions yesterday at the PSC meeting. They did not finish which means I will come on at the tail end of those.

That is a place where we’re going to have some significant conversations about — maybe Entergy Louisiana needs to be eating up some of this hardening cost. For too long we operated on the notion that the state law and statute and constitution didn’t allow us to pass those costs onto Entergy Louisiana or a utility company. Now there is a report. I have not been able to see the report; the report was only to the commission and it was talked about in the meeting. I’m speaking based off of only what was shown in the public hearing. Hopefully when I’m sworn in I can read that full report — that’s a place. When we talk about hardening the grid especially not on ratepayers because everything that we’ve talked about burying transition lines underground the investments in the grid has always talked about “Oh it’s gonna cost us money it’s gonna cost us money but all that money has gone to the ratepayers.”

But it’s this convoluted system. If the grid goes down — hey you’re not investing in hardening the grid proactively because you say “If I do that it’s going to the ratepayers.” Then a storm comes the grid goes down. Now you need to repair it. And the way you repair it is by passing it to the ratepayers. So this like kind of argumentation that it’s going to raise costs really falls flat on me because either way these companies if they are proactively trying to do it or if they’re retroactively doing it because of damages have always tried to pass it to the ratepayers.

It looks like we now have an avenue where that doesn’t have to be the case. Like I said I don’t have all the details just yet. But this is something that I’m gonna take very seriously on because this is important for energy efficiency. This is important to our transition over time. This is important to protecting our ratepayers.

America is one of the world's most industrialized regions with the largest economy in nominal terms. This also makes it one of the world's largest consumers of electricity ranking second only to China through 3.9 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2021. In terms of sources of energy consumption petroleum and natural gas account for the largest sources and renewable energy ranks in third place. Sector wise industrial transportation and electrical power use are the largest electricity consumers in the U.S. and natural gas is the most widely used production source according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Courtesy of some of the best educational institutions in the world the U.S. is also leading the charge in researching innovative mediums for generating renewable energy. Not only is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) an American firm the world's first car maker to successfully mass produce an electric vehicle but researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are investigating methods to improve electricity generation through waves and the Sun as well as new mediums to store electricity. While solar cells are common these days these materials are unable to tap the vast amounts of energy that the Sun beams down to the Earth. On this front MIT is searching for materials that are cost effective scalable reliable and efficient at the same time. To do this they are utilizing machine learning and rapid experimentation to quickly sift through materials in hopes that a new one will provide a breakthrough.

When talking about energy any discussion would be incomplete without nuclear power plants. There are two kinds of nuclear reactions fission and fusion. With the former atoms are split up to squeeze out energy from them. However the latter is vastly more powerful (and complex) since it requires squeezing the atoms together and the resulting energy is harnessed as power. Fusion is the Sun's primary energy source and all nuclear plants in the world use fission instead. In the area of fusion the U.S. federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California was able to generate more energy from a Hydrogen plasma bombarded with lasers than the electricity used in operating the lasers instead. This was a crucial breakthrough since fusion is the most efficient and cleanest source of power - even on the nuclear front as it does not generate any radioactive waste.

Story continues

Additionally America also passed one of the most important pieces of legislation for renewable energy this year in form of the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill provides roughly $370 billion in government subsidies for clean power generation. This provides the incentive for even some of the biggest American energy companies to invest in the field. Finally global crude oil prices have injected fresh rigor into renewable energy production after they jumped to a whopping $139 per barrel earlier this year in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Today we'll take a look at the largest American energy firms with the top picks being Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE).

Twitter CEO Elon Musk has been urged in a post on a criminal data breach forum by a member who claims to have gotten the emails and phone numbers of 400 million Twitter users.

With users flocking to the rival Mastodon controversial new view count feature and now the breach; Elon Musk seems to have no end of troubles to deal with. The seller a member of data breach forums named Ryushi claims the data was scraped via a Twitter vulnerability. Vitalik Buterin Sundar Pichai Mark Cuban and others are among those whose data was allegedly compromised.

Twitter data breach: 400 million users affected according to a hacker

Over 400 million Twitter accounts have had their data exposed and are now for sale on the deep web. The hacker claims the information is confidential and contains the email addresses and phone numbers of famous people government officials businesses and normal users. An Israeli cyber intelligence agency called Hudson Rock reportedly discovered the posting first.

BREAKING: Hudson Rock discovered a credible threat actor is selling 400000000 Twitter users data. The private database contains devastating amounts of information including emails and phone numbers of high profile users such as AOC Kevin O'Leary Vitalik Buterin & more (1/2). pic.twitter.com/wQU5LLQeE1 — Hudson Rock (@RockHudsonRock) December 24 2022

A sample of the data was shared on one of the hacker forums by the hacker to demonstrate the authenticity of the data. The followings are included in the Twitter data breach sample data:

Email addresses

Names

Usernames

Numbers of followers

Profiles’ dates of creation

Phone numbers

The shocking part is that the hacker released sample data from high-profile user accounts. The Twitter data breach sample includes information from the following sources:

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

SpaceX

CBS Media

Donald Trump Jr.

Doja Cat

Charlie Puth

Sundar Pichai

Salman Khan

NASA’s JWST account

NBA

Ministry of Information and Broadcasting India

Shawn Mendes

Social Media of WHO

Many more data from high-profile users can be found in the sample set. If the data leak is real it will be incredibly destructive but most of the traces will point to the social media team. Hudson Rock co-founder and CTO Alon Gal speculate that the information was accessed through an API vulnerability that allowed the threat actor to query any email or phone number and receive a Twitter profile.

“Twitter or Elon Musk if you are reading this you are already risking a GDPR fine over 5.4m breach imagine the fine of 400m users breach source. Your best option to avoid paying $276 million USD in GDPR breach fines like facebook did (due to 533m users being scraped) is to buy this data exclusively.” The hacker explains his motives in his post

The Twitter data breach hacker indicates that he is willing to negotiate the ‘Deal’ through a middleman:

“After that I will delete this thread and will not sell this data again. And data will not be sold to anyone else which will prevent a lot of celebrities and politicians from Phishing Crypto scams Sim swapping Doxxing and other things that will make your users Lose trust in you as a company and thus stunt the current growth and hype that you are having also just imagine famous content creators and influencers getting hacked on twitter that will for sure Make them ghost the platform and ruin your dream of twitter video sharing platform for content creators also since you Made the mistake of changing twitter policy that got an immense backlash.” The hacker

According to Alon Gal Twitter has inserted a “readers context” in which they credit the database of 400000000 Twitter users to the data leak in August that affected 5400000 users.

“This is easily disproved by comparing the samples in the new leak to the older 5.4m version which had already been leaked publicly. 250 out of 1000 are found. (the count would have been lower had it been a sample of non-verified accounts) I can’t share some sensitive information I have but as time goes on I am more confident this is a 400000000 users leak and as always it will unfortunately leak to the hands of every hacker for free.” Alon Gal

After slamming Twitter’s business and policies with a sledgehammer Elon Musk may find himself on the receiving end of a massive data breach. The DPC is currently looking into the earlier security breach.

The Twitter data breach claim came a day after the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) stated it would look into a prior Twitter data leak that affected over 5.4 million users.

Have you ever wondered what could happen if an open-source Twitter algorithm existed? We did.

Twitter data breach: How did alleged hack happen?

The Twitter data breach seller identified as Ryushi a frequent contributor to hacker forums asserts that the information was obtained via exploiting a security hole. While the Twitter data breach allegedly happened hacker Sunny Nehra hinted that more information was stolen through the same vulnerability.

According to reports the hacker is attempting to sell the data which includes contact information for prominent Twitter users like Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai Bollywood actor Salman Khan the Indian Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Elon Musk’s SpaceX CBS Media Donald Trump Jr. and American politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

2/ Twitter had accepted that the said API flaw was abused in the wild but it’s high time now that they also confirm how many exact users and who all were infected (alert all those users). We can’t wait for some or other new dumps related to the same flaw getting leaked with time. — Sunny Nehra (@sunnynehrabro) December 26 2022

According to reports the Twitter data breach hacker is negotiating a purchase of the data with Twitter CEO Musk in an effort to sidestep potential GDPR-related legal action.

The hacker claims that they will destroy the data and not sell it to anyone else if Musk pays the ransom “to avoid a lot of celebrities and politicians from Phishing Crypto frauds Sim swapping Doxxing and other things.”

Targeted phishing attempts via text and email sim switch attacks to get access to accounts and doxing are all possible outcomes of a data breach using such information.

The supposed hacker’s Breached post promoting the database for sale is still active as of this writing.

Users are urged to take measures such as using a private self-hosted crypto wallet changing their passwords frequently and storing them safely and using two-factor authentication settings (through an app rather than their phone number) on all of their accounts.

Data breaches and hacks are today’s biggest problems. Check out the latest data breaches and hacks before we continue: CHI Health data breach Facebook data breach Uber security data breach American Airlines data breach Medibank cyber attack and Binance hack.

Outcomes of similar major data breaches: Equifax & T-Mobile

The credit reporting firm Equifax acknowledged on September 7 2017 that one of its computer networks had had a data leak that had exposed the personal information of 143 million clients which eventually rose to 147 million. These records included information about the customers’ names residences dates of birth Social Security numbers and credit card numbers all of which may be exploited for fraud and identity theft.

Equifax agreed to establish a fund to provide customers with free credit monitoring identity theft protection and cash compensation of up to $20000 per to people harmed by the event per the deal’s conditions. Additionally the company must pay court fees and government fines.

Take a closer look at how data breaches effects companies: Equifax Data breach settlement

The cybersecurity vulnerability was first disclosed by T-Mobile and was made public on August 16 2021. According to reports almost 77 million consumers’ personally identifiable information was stolen due to the T-Mobile data breach. This contained database data such as addresses dates of birth social security numbers driver’s license numbers unique IMEIs and identification codes for client phones and so on.

If granted the $350 million T-Mobile deal will represent US history’s second-largest payment for a data breach.",,,,,,,,,,,,

At HousingWire we decided to break down the challenges the title insurance industry will be up against in 2023.

It was too darn hot: the housing market slows down

Many in the title insurance industry reported record years in 2021 but while experts were predicting things to slow down in 2022 the suddenness at which the market cooled was unexpected or as Jodi Ketchersid a Destin Florida-based Corcoran Group agent said: “It was like ‘Holy cow! What happened to the market?’”

At many title firms the slowdown in homebuyer demand due to rising mortgage rates and higher home prices meant a decrease in order volumes. At “Big Four” title insurer First American the number of closed title orders in the third quarter of 2022 fell to 160500 compared to 252700 a year ago while the number of purchase orders closed per day at Fidelity dropped 23% year over year in the third quarter.

On top of slowing purchase order volume rising mortgage rates also decimated refinance orders. First American executives noted that refinance revenue had declined 68% compared to a year ago on the firm’s third quarter earnings call with investors while Old Republic International Corp.’s president and CEO Craig Smiddy told investors on his firm’s Q2 2022 earnings call that refinance activity had “dried up.”

As a result many title firms have found revenue coming from different sources including stronger than expected commercial revenue and other mortgage products such as home equity lines of credit (HELOCs).

A report by TransUnion showed that the number of HELOC originations nationwide based on the credit bureau’s analysis jumped from 207422 for second-quarter 2021 to 291736 for the second quarter of this year — a 41% increase. In addition nearly $69 billion in HELOC credit limits and $27 billion in closed-end home-equity loans were originated over the first five months of 2021. That compares with $101 billion in HELOC volume and $38 billion in closed-end home-equity originations over the same period this year according to a recent report by the Urban Institute’s Housing Finance Policy Center.

“I would say starting back in the spring we started seeing a lot of lenders switch to HELOCs” Regina Braga the president of RES/Title said. “Currently I would say the majority of our volume is some type of HELOC product.”

Prior to the recent rise in HELOC volume Braga said her firm typically saw HELOCs as part of simultaneous closings where buyers would do a first mortgage and a HELOC at the same time. Product specific HELOCs such as those for solar panels were also common.

“HELOCs were definitely out there but what is happening now is that you are seeing lenders that hadn’t really been pushing it as a main product line before and now all of a sudden you go to their website and it is the first thing you see” she said. “They have always been there but now they are at the actual forefront of the marketing lenders are doing.”

Braga anticipates that the market will slow down even further in 2023.

“The market has cooled way down but I don’t even think we are necessarily there yet of what we are going to see” Braga said. “The holidays and early part of the winter are always slow for the industry but then as the spring comes you will start to see a little bit more movement on the purchase side. We have already started to see sellers start to lower their prices to adjust to what is acceptable in this market so that might drive more buyers in and then you will always have that steady level of purchase demand for people who need a home due to life events.”

For the title insurance industry she feels this will result in a thinning of the herd.

“People that rode the wave of the boom might not be able to sustain it” Braga said. “But I do think that companies that are diversifying companies that have already been around for the long haul they will be OK because I think diversification is the key and it we have learned anything in the title industry over the last year it is that you cannot dedicate all of your business to one particular market.”

A thoroughly modern threat: Wire fraud

Although the title industry has dealt with its share of market slowdowns shifts recessions and depressions one challenge the industry will face in 2023 is decidedly 21st century.

As consumers demand more of a seamless and digital home-buying process more of the closing process has migrated online making home-buying transactions ripe for things like hacking ransomware attacks and wire fraud.

In mid-November the Federal Bureau of Investigations released its 2022 Congressional report on business email compromise (BEC) and real estate wire fraud. According to the report in 2021 the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) received BEC-related complaints with claimed losses exceeding $2.4 billion far higher than the $360 million in claimed losses recorded in 2016. In comparison the second highest dollar loss category reported to the IC3 in 2021 was investment fraud with losses of approximately $1.45 billion.

In addition ALTA expects the annual number of BECs to more than double in the next two years.

For the past several years the FBI says BEC has consistently been the largest dollar loss by victims’ crime typology reported to the IC3 as “criminals have been refining their exploitation of technology especially the internet to carry out financial crimes.” According to a 2022 survey by ALTA of all the reported wire fraud incidents that occur each year only 17% of victims successfully recovered all of their funds but 94% of respondents reported some amount of recovery.

“You have minutes to hours to act once you have knowledge that either your company sent money where it wasn’t supposed to go or you’ve got a buyer out there hanging because they sent $50000 to a fraudster” Matt McBride the vice president of risk management and compliance at Shaddock National Holdings told attendees at the 2022 ALTA One conference. “If it goes to 24 hours your likelihood of recovery is 15%. If it goes to 48 hours you are in the 2% range. If it goes to 72 hours then it is gone. There is nothing anybody can do at that point.”

But even as the title industry improves its awareness and preparedness to deal with wire fraud attacks the fraudsters are hard at work refining their tactics.

“The fraudsters keep getting more sophisticated and the frequency of attacks continues to go up” Tyler Adams the co-founder and CEO of SaaS company CertifID said. “Fraud doesn’t sleep and even though transaction volume has gone down the amount of fraud we are seeing hasn’t gone down so your likelihood of getting hit with an attack is higher.”

As the industry looks to combat this problem education about wire fraud and prevention is paramount.

“It starts with education because you can’t expect the consumer to educate themselves on this problem” Matt Kilmartin the vice president of sales at CertifID said. “Also a lot of business comes from referrals so strengthening those relationships and making sure everyone is aware of the risks the better. Title is at the middle of the transaction but that doesn’t mean it should bear all of the responsibility.”

Kilmartin also added that clearly communicating when and how the closing will be conducted as well as using things like two factor authentication to ensure you are sending the funds to the right place can also help prevent people from becoming victims of wire fraud.

What’s old is new again: the resurgence of attorney opinion letters

In early April Fannie Mae sent shock waves through the title insurance industry when it announced that it would be accepting written opinion letters from an attorney in lieu of a title insurance policy “in limited circumstances. The announcement meant that Fannie Mae joined the other GSE Freddie Mac in accepting AOLs.

Prior to the advent of title insurance before taking title to a property the buyer required that the title be free of any rights interests liens of encumbrances of others for which the buyer would be responsible for. A title search would be conducted and then a conveyancer would issue an opinion on the title incredibly similar to the attorney opinion letter option now available through the GSEs.

Since Fannie Mae’s announcement the title insurance trade group American Land Title Association has taken a strong stance against AOLs and other title insurance alternatives.

“Since Fannie’s announcement earlier this year ALTA has been out front opposing the irresponsible use of title insurance alternatives that provide less coverage and introduce more risk for the lenders and the consumers” Diane Tomb the CEO of ALTA told ALTA ONE conference attendees in mid-October. “This is a top priority for ALTA.”

Over the summer of 2022 Tomb said the impact of this policy change was expanded when the Federal Housing Finance Agency approved the GSEs’ release of their Equitable Housing Finance Plans.

“The intent was to promote affordable and sustainable housing opportunities for more households nationwide” Tomb said. “One of the goals they outlined in those plans is a push to reduce closing costs especially for low-income borrowers. Based on those plans both GSEs are pushing pilot programs promoting the use of attorney opinion letters reportedly as an alternative to reduce closing costs.”

So far a handful of firms have begun offering AOL products including Voxtur Analytics SingleSource Property Solutions and United Wholesale Mortgage whose CEO Mat Ishbia announced that the firm is hiring attorneys to review title and closing documents AOLs and the risks associated with them. All three firms claim that the savings generated by using an AOL product instead of a traditional title insurance policy could save consumers up to an “entire mortgage payment.”

“The use of Attorney Opinion Letters as an alternative to title insurance is an established practice that provides security and coverage to the lender and borrower comparable to that of title insurance” Voxtur’s CEO Jim Albertelli told HousingWire earlier this year. “As this alternative continues to grow in popularity we anticipate that misinformation will continue to be released particularly by those that see an alternative product as a competitive threat. The reality is that innovation like this leads to more efficient processes and lower costs that benefit homeowners and that is exactly what we should all be striving to achieve.”

ALTA on the other hand said it has not noted considerable savings in using AOLs versus a traditional title policy. Instead ALTA warns that due to the risks posed by AOL coverage using an AOL may cost a consumer more in the long run.

“These products that are going into the market — it is confusing because they are giving people who need it the most less coverage” Tomb said. “We haven’t seen any real data based on the conversation that it is going to save money. In some ways it could cost them more. They might actually lose their home.”

In mid-October the AOL debate caught the attention of U.S. Congressman Blaine Luetkemeyer (MO-3) a top Republican on the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions and Congressman Brad Sherman (CA-30) a top Democrat on the Subcommittee on Investor Protection Entrepreneurship and Capital Markets. Together the congressmen sent a letter to FHFA Director Sandra Thompson sharing their concerns about the broadening use of attorney opinion letters.

“The plans aim to lower closing costs and make homeownership more accessible for low- to moderate- income and minority homebuyers. However these initiatives appear to risk exposing these consumers to harm by not providing the same consumer protections as title insurance. They also raise concerns about the safety and soundness of the Enterprises increase taxpayer risk which FHFA must consider as the GSEs’ regulator and conservator” the letter stated.

“Given these issues it is critical for Congress and other policymakers to understand how attorney opinion letters will be promoted to consumers and what representations will be made to encourage their use of this product” it continued. “For example Freddie Mac indicates its pilots will involve ‘targeted marketing and outreach’ through ‘lenders and community organizations.’ Many legal practitioners and respected legal scholars have argued that not requiring homeowners to purchase title insurance (absent an extensive written disclaimer explaining the risks to the consumer) should itself be considered legal malpractice. This raises concerns that the ‘targeted marketing’ of the closing cost pilots may fail to adequately convey these risks to consumers misleadingly suggest to homebuyers that attorney title opinions have been endorsed by the Enterprises or the federal government and even potentially cross the line into the unauthorized practice of law.”

ALTA said it was pleased to have the support of the two congressmen.

“We certainly think that the fact that it was a bipartisan letter means that it is going to get a lot more attention over at FHFA” Steve Gottheim ALTA’s general counsel said. “We hope that means that they really do take the concerns much more seriously seeing as they come from senior members of both house financial services and house small business committee that they are able to really realize that this is not just an industry group coming to them with these concerns.”

ALTA hopes that this letter as well as continued pressure from the trade organization and industry experts will encourage the FHFA to reexamine AOLs and press pause of the rollout of AOL products.

“So much of this hasn’t really been thought through in terms of how it is really going to play out in the marketplace and are we really providing a product or a load a moderate first-time homebuyer that has less coverage the potentially might need the same if not more in some cases” Tomb said. “Then on the other side from a capital markets standpoint what is this going to look like in the market? Is it really costing less? We feel that these things should really be discussed further before this gets out into the marketplace and it doesn’t play out the way they expect.”

With regulatory focus honing in on closing costs and specifically the cost of title insurance ALTA and others in the industry are looking for ways to lower costs.

Steve Berneman the co-founder and CEO of Blueprint Title whose self-proclaimed goal is to “shrink the title insurance business from an $18 billion business to a $10 billion business” fully supports this goal.

“We believe that title insurance premiums are significantly too high and that if underwriters and agents were more efficient and took a different approach to the market they wouldn’t have to charge as much” Berneman said. “The more these companies can invest in technology and streamlining the process and reducing frictions within acquiring a title policy the more they will be able to reduce costs.”

Gottheim added: “Over the last 10 years rates have gone down 6% across the industry and that is important for homeowners and it’s because of the investment the industry has put into things around automation and using machine learning and AI to search title and come to a faster decision about the title” Gottheim said. “These technologies come with a cost at the front end but over time they bring that efficiency and bring the price down.”

Before the parade passes by: title insurance’s aging workforce

As the title insurance industry looks to work through these three challenges in 2023 the final hurdle facing the industry is not a new one.

“Every year since I have been in this role and even before that attracting and retaining talent has been one of our top strategic priorities” Tomb told attendees listening to PropLogix’s State of the Title Industry report webinar in early December. “We do have an aging workforce and it is something that we think about a lot. One of the things that we are currently working on is a new consumer facing website that is focused solely on bringing talent into the title insurance field.”

As of 2014 the average age of title insurance agents and brokers was around 60 years old and the situation has not improved much if at all.

The report which was distributed in August 2022 found that 67% of respondents were over the age of 45 with the largest age brackets being 45-54 and 55-64 at 28% each. The second largest age bracket was 35-44 at 19%.

In addition to improving consumer outreach David Townsend the president and CEO of Agent’s National Title told webinar attendees that he is also working at the college level to recruit younger people into the industry and has written courses for the University of Missouri law school.

“What we are seeing now with a lot of title agents it is not the traditional search and exam that it used to be where you would go over to a dusty title plant and get in the card file” Townsend said. “Now we are a data industry and a lot of what we do the search exam and commitments are provided by the underwriter or a third party. So you are having to make sure that you understand where the data is coming from and more and more. I think you are going to see the jobs in our industry be data driven and technology driven and I think that is critical for us and that will skew younger to a certain degree.”

In addition title firms big and small across the country have started offering internship programs which have led to the cultivation and retention of new younger talent.

“We were recently looking for a role replacement and ended up calling up someone from the internship program to see if they were interesting in coming back for a full-time job” Ryan Swed Stewart’s head of U.S. national commercial services told HousingWire last November. “It has been a great way to expand our potential talent pool.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcy5jb20vc2VhdHRsZS1uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzL3Nob3JlbGluZS1kaXJlY3RzLWdyb3d0aC10by1hdXJvcmEtYXMtd2EtZXllcy1taWRkbGUtaG91c2luZy1jaGFuZ2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shoreline directs growth on Aurora as WA eyes ‘middle housing’ changes,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.seattletimes.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /seattle-news/politics/shoreline-directs-growth-to-aurora-as-wa-eyes-middle-housing-changes/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000212261D2C80>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcy5jb20vc2VhdHRsZS1uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzL3Nob3JlbGluZS1kaXJlY3RzLWdyb3d0aC10by1hdXJvcmEtYXMtd2EtZXllcy1taWRkbGUtaG91c2luZy1jaGFuZ2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,

It announced Friday that it is delaying a planned rule change for those who use apps for business transactions and make over $600 a year in profits.

The new rule would require third-party payment platforms to issue a 1099K to both the IRS and the individual app user.

This follows concerns from the tax preparation community the electronic transactions community and some lawmakers.

In the past a 1099K was only required from a virtual platform if someone completes over 200 business transactions in a year and earns over $20000.

Image: Courtesy Retro Revival SRQ and Sarasota Magazine Composite

When Rhianna Romero and her husband Colton Toth relocated to Sarasota from Tampa in 2021 Romero was puzzled about how to take advantage of their rental home’s shed workshop. Fascinated by vintage furniture and creative hands-on activities Romero decided to combine her passions and use the space to refinish a midcentury modern dresser that she found on Facebook Marketplace. A week after listing the piece on Etsy the dresser sold and the pair realized that they had stumbled upon a profitable side hustle.

“I’ve always been thrifty and enjoy repurposing things” says Romero “and when we sold the dresser Colton recognized a business opportunity.”

They launched their shop Retro Revival SRQ on Etsy in 2021 and began collecting and refinishing a variety of pieces. Less than two years later on Dec. 17 the enterprising couple celebrated the grand opening of a 1600-square-foot brick-and-mortar location.

Together Toth and Romero learned how to repair and refinish vintage pieces a process that has brought them even closer. “We could not do this business if we didn’t have each other because we both bring our own sets of skills and passions together to make this successful” says Romero. “We are grateful that we get to work alongside each other every day.”

When they opened the Etsy shop Toth now 26 worked as an accountant and Romero now 27 was an executive assistant. Eleven months into the project Toth left his job to pursue the venture full-time. Romero kept her job but continues to pour her free time into the business which carries many dressers bedroom sets and chairs.

Most of the pieces on offer are midcentury modern post-modern or Danish modern and were produced during the 1950s to 1980s. Romero and Toth are always on the hunt for new pieces but mainly source them in Florida. Beyond having an inherently sharp eye for finding the pieces though there was a learning curve.

“When Rhianna first refinished the dresser she painted it sage green which we learned is a big no-no when it comes to midcentury furniture because the goal is to keep the piece as close to its original state as possible” says Toth. The more pieces they refinish the more the couple discovers how to ensure the furniture stays period-correct and is refinished to the highest standards.

“Six months ago we would’ve just colored in a chip on a piece but now we take the time to level and paint it resulting in a higher quality end-product” Toth says. The pair mostly spruces up the tops of pieces and fixes chips striving to improve the finish of every piece. While pricing depends on the piece itself most range from $500 to $3000.

""This piece was an heirloom for over 50 years from a family who lived overseas. We restored it with the help of a friend and hope it will last for generations to come"" says Romero. The piece was sold for $2995. Image: Courtesy Retro Revival SRQ

“Older furniture has more charm and character and is built better than what you get today” says Romero an element that has contributed to midcentury furniture’s rise in popularity in recent years. Toth also adds that supply chain issues have made vintage furniture more appealing to consumers who can purchase it right away and bring it home the same day.

Given Sarasota’s history as a pioneering city in the midcentury modern movement it’s no surprise that the couple’s business is booming.

“Sarasota is a great area for us because of the history of midcentury homes and collectors in this area” says Toth. In the future the couple sees themselves continuing to curate an upscale store and giving Sarasotans the opportunity to shop for impressive vintage midcentury furniture locally.

Winter Storm Elliott swept through the Pacific Northwest Plains Midwest and Great Lakes which left many without power and under heavy snow. However nobody was hit harder than the City of Buffalo and Western New York.

The lake effect snow ban made things far worse. Blizzard conditions lasted nearly 48 hours with wind gusts past 70 mph and left thousands without power and everyone either stuck in their homes or stranded in their vehicles or at businesses.

At least 25 people have died from the blizzard and that number could grow this week. The City of Buffalo Amherst Clarence Cheektowaga Lackawanna Hamburg and Evans are all under a travel ban and there is a travel advisory for the rest of Western New York where people are asked not to travel unless it is absolutely necessary.

The Buffalo Bills missed most of the Christmas holiday as stayed in Chicago after their win over the Bears on Christmas Eve. They did get back to Buffalo by late on Christmas Day by flying to Rochester and driving back the rest of the day.

Bills wide receiver Stefon Diggs tweeted on Monday about the storm and asked people to pray for everyone in Buffalo.

The cleanup will take days. There are still tons of stranded vehicles on roadways and many streets especially residential streets have not been plowed yet.

I've lived through the November of 2000 snowstorm the October Surprise Storm Snovember and last month's 6-7 feet of snowstorm...this is the worst storm I have ever seen in Western New York. The fact it had to happen on Christmas weekend just makes it that much worse.

Case in point: Netflix’s documentary series Harry & Meghan which began airing on December 8 shows the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have decorated their Montecito home office which serves as the headquarters of their nonprofit Archewell Foundation with affordable art prints. At center is an image of Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller’s Portrait of Louise Mayer (1836) with its subject newly depicted blowing a bubble with gum.

This particular piece is available for purchase through eBay for anywhere from $9.49 to $79.79 depending on its size which ranges from 13 x 18 centimeters to 90 x 120 centimeters.

Tacking on bubblegum to historical paintings has spawned a veritable industry across craft platforms like Etsy. Other websites such as Outlet Trends and AliExpress retail bubblegum-ified versions of portraits from Johannes Vermeer’s Girl with a Pearl Earring (1665) and Francois-Hubert Drouais’s Portrait of an Elegant Lady (ca. 18th-century) to Leonardo da Vinci’s Lady with an Ermine (ca. 1489–91) and Sir Thomas Lawrence’s Lady Maria Conyngham (ca. 1824–25).

The couple’s office also features a framed print of a bear holding the state of California an image that is featured on the cover of the sheet music for California’s state anthem “I Love You California” first published in 1913. This design choice was likely made because Markle was born and raised in the Golden State.

The artwork also appeared behind Markle during a video call in 2020. Variations of this piece are available on sites including Etsy Zazzle and Redbubble.

While it has been alleged that the docuseries was filmed at a 13599-square-foot Montecito estate that does not belong to the Prince and Markle and is currently on the market for $33.5 million it seems their actual Montecito estate—which they reportedly purchased for $14.5 million in 2020—does appear in the series given a number of exterior shots that match the home’s listing photos.

Another reasonably priced item that appears in the series is a $25 book titled 20th Century Photography published by Taschen. This particular tome—which has been in print since 2012—focuses on the expansive photography collection of Museum Ludwig Cologne the first contemporary art museum to dedicate a significant part of its collection to photography. The museum holds some 70000 photographs from the 19th-century to present day while the book itself contains upwards of 850 photographs spanning a century-long timeline.

The volume is framed in shot with a Hermès throw blanket. Though no longer produced by the luxury house similar versions can be found on the resale market with price tags northwards of $1500.

It would get them through a dark dangerous winter. Those brave embattled men women and children need to know that they are not alone.

They already know that Westport has their back. They are very very grateful for what we’ve done.

Now on Christmas Day let’s give them everything they need.

$250000 sounds like a lot. But it breaks down to just $10 for every resident of Westport.

Eversource earned props for putting crews on the road early during Friday’s wind and rain storm. The number of outages in Westport was halved throughout the day from 700 or so to about 350.

Their performance since then has been less praise-worthy.

An “06880” reader wrote last night just before midnight:

“I am spending the holidays with my 92-year-old homebound mom on Bayberry Ridge Road. Power has been out for the whole street since 4 a.m. Friday. Despite 40-plus hours elapsing Eversource still has no projection for repair citing ‘To Be Determined’ as the date when one inquires.

“They no longer even list Westport on the updated outage report because over 99% of homes have power. This is cold comfort to residents on this street who cannot get any information out of this vastly overpaid and underperforming public utility. With zero communication since the beginning we worry that they’ve forgotten about us entirely.”

The reader responded at 1:04 a.m. that his power was back on. He doesn’t know if it was the result of his phone call Tweet or because they were about to do it anyway.

I’m keeping his complaint up though because it’s not isolated. I’ve heard from other readers in the north end of Westport who also had issues with Eversource.

Most seemed to understand the severity of the problem. What bothered them was Eversource’s lack of communication about when power was expected to return.

“We just want to be able to plan” one reader said.

=======================================================

Compare the situation in Lyman (top story above) with the behavior of one Very Entitled Driver downtown yesterday.

He ignored several “One Way/Do Not Enter” signs. He headed past all the cars on 2 sides of the street facing toward him.

Drivers stopped. One rolled down his window and explained the driver was going the wrong way.

He couldn’t be bothered. Perhaps backing up was too difficult or time-consuming. Maybe doing so would be admitting wrongdoing or a blow to his masculinity.

So he got out of his car. He had angry words with one of the right-way drivers.

Then he got back in his vehicle swerved around a couple of cars and kept driving.

All the way to the Post Road.

=======================================================

Also downtown: Our own Barnes & Noble was featured in the opening seconds of Yahoo News’ recent feature on the chain’s resurgence.

Young readers in particular have driven the opening of new (and newly designed) stores.

CEO James Daunt was interviewed by Dave Briggs. The Yahoo journalist knows what he’s talking about — he lives here in Westport just a couple of miles from one of those slimmed-down brighter more open and less “library-looking” Barnes & Noble’s than the previous one.

======================================================

The Burying Hill High Tide Club has earned an “06880” mention — and props — for weekly swims at that Greens Farms beach all the way through fall.

Now another group is earning even more awe (and raised eyebrows).

Nico Eisenberger reports: “This year we spawned a crazy cousin of the High Tide Club. Inspired by some of the hardy originals and carried forward with an unreasonable and illogical vigor is Club Plunge.

“We’ve done it every week since early November. It’s amazing and wonderful — and makes you think that maybe the extremophiles one sees on YouTube are really on to something.”

The group includes 8 regulars.

“We try to stay in for at least 3 minutes” Nico says. “The screaming subsides after 1 minute then picks up again after 2.”

No word on “weather” they ventured in yesterday.

======================================================

Today’s “Westport … Naturally” photo shows how a gifted decorator can transform beautiful plants and flowers into something even more stunning.

This is the holiday table at the home of Elena and Richard Nasereddin. She’s Catholic. He’s Muslim.

Both wish everyone in the “0688o” community — in Westport and cyberspace — “happy holidays and many blessings in the new year.”

====================================================

And finally … Christmas music ends tonight. Whether that’s good or bad depends on your threshold for jinglyness.

But before we say goodbye (till next year) to Mariah Carey Josh Groban Michael Jackson Bruce Springsteen Bobby Helms Bing Crosby and Gene Autry let’s tip our Santa hat to Johnny Marks.

He lived for many years on Green Acre Lane off South Compo. He died in 1985 from complications of diabetes. His son still lives here.

Who was Johnny Marks?

Just the guy who wrote “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.”

And “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree.” “Run Rudolph Run.” “Have a Holly Jolly Christmas.” And many others.

Not bad for a Jewish kid from Mount Vernon New York.

Merry Christmas! Oy!

Working on Christmas Day

Among the hardest hit communities in the Seacoast region:

Unitil spokesman Alec O'Meara said crews would continue working round the clock into Christmas Day to get power restored to most customers by the end of Sunday.

“It’s Christmas morning and many of our customers are still waking up to no power. We understand this has been a very difficult time for our customers especially on Christmas and with frigid temperatures in the wake of the storm” O’Meara said in a statement. “Our crews have worked around the clock restoring power to tens of thousands of customers who lost power during Friday’s high winds. They’ll continue to work tirelessly throughout the event until all outages are restored.""

He thanked the work of crews and municipal officials during the restoration period and customers for their patience.

O'Meara asked customers who are not restored but their neighbors are to contact the utility as there could be an issue preventing restoration.

Clean Up Safely

The New Hampshire Department of Safety’s Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management offered some advice about cleaning up and handling food that was in a refrigerator without power.

Keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed when you lose power. An unopened refrigerator will keep cold for 4 hours and a full freezer will keep the temperature for about 48 hours.

Throw away any food that has been exposed to temperatures 40°F for 2 or more hours or that has an unusual odor texture or color. When in doubt throw it out.

If food in the freezer is colder than 40°F and has ice crystals on it you can refreeze it.

Contact your doctor if you are concerned about medications having spoiled.

Don't use appliances or motors that have gotten wet unless they have been taken apart cleaned and dried. Some appliances keep electrical charges even after they have been unplugged.

Utilities have been one of the hottest topics of 2022 as the Russian invasion of Ukraine ushered in a wave of inflation especially in Europe. In fact in the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) energy inflation stood at 28.1% on average. The bulk of this inflation was contributed by 13 countries all of which saw energy inflation soar above a painful 30%. The largest inflation was in Italy where energy prices soared by a whopping 71% annually in October.

The U.S on the other hand saw relatively 'muted' energy inflation that stood at just 17.3% in the same month. This was the third lowest among all G7 economies and the primary reason that Americans remained better off was that they do not rely on Russian energy imports. However this does not mean that prices are low as natural gas and coal shortages have nevertheless pushed up retail utility prices to five year highs especially as record natural gas prices ended up driving the cost of producing electricity. For America these price increases are unavoidable since the largest portion (35.4%) of electricity is generated via natural gas. The price volatility itself has expedited the shift to renewable energy among utilities according to the IEA.

However these prices which end up in massive profits for power producers do have a silver lining. According to Bloomberg these companies are selling excess capacity at lower prices - rates that coal and gas producers cannot match. This according to analysts can end up putting the coal companies out of business and reducing emissions in the long term. The latest in the U.S. energy and utility sector these days is Winter Storm Elliott which has disrupted oil and gas output - which in turn has led to higher prices and power blackouts all over the country. U.S. benchmark oil prices jumped to $79.56 a barrel while power prices soared to $3700 per megawatt hour. Some oil companies that suffered from the reduced output are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC).

Today we will look at which companies are the largest when it comes to providing electricity and gas to Americans. Some largest U.S. utilities are Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO).

As of Monday morning fewer than 1000 people are still without power a drop from the more than 80000 customers Friday night.

Crews from across the country have come to New England in an effort to help clean up the remnants of Friday's storm. Powerful winds and rain brought down trees and powerlines across the region causing widespread outages that meant hardship for many over the weekend and Christmas Day.

It was the second weekend in a row for many Granite Staters without power after winter weather.

Sunday Dec. 25: Utility crews continue to make progress on restoring power to thousands of Granite Staters.

As of 8 a.m. on Christmas Day outages were down to about 17000 statewide: 9800 from Eversource 6300 from New Hampshire Electric Co-op and 1100 from Unitil.

Eversource reported that line crews had already restored power to nearly 300000 — one indicator of the severity of this storm.

Today these crews were dealing with extensive tree damage and broken poles on Auburn Rd in Hooksett. Replacing a pole can take ~6-12 hours and typically requires a digger truck & several lineworkers.

Carry On is our series devoted to how we get away in the digital age from the choices we make to the experiences we share.

The pandemic may still be rearing its ugly head but travel is back in a big way.

While bingeing our favorite shows and working from home we've been plotting our next wanderlust destinations. At the same time travel and tech companies have been quickly evolving with the times to develop technologies like AI biometrics and remote work solutions to enhance or improve the travel experience. That's setting up 2023 for a big year in travel. Here are some of the top travel tech trends we expect to see in 2023.

1. Airports getting a tech upgrade

Expect to see a whole lot more technology designed to make airport travel easier. From before you even leave your house to baggage claim new technologies are stepping in to address the headaches that come with flying. Clear now offers a free online tool called Reserve to book your spot in the security line ahead of time. Of course Clear also hopes you'll sign up for its paid membership which offers identity verification and expedited security using biometrics (eye or fingerprint scanning).

The Transportation Security Administration is expanding its biometrics pilot. TSA is testing facial recognition technology in 16 airports for identity verification and plans to expand the program to more airports in the ""coming months.""

Once you're through the security line your face and hands will be put to work a lot more for buying snacks and magazines per a 2023 travel trend report from Amadeus . ApplePay and GooglePay already offer payments authorized by facial recognition technology. But this year your favorite airport store Hudson partnered with Amazon to begin testing its ""Just Walk Out"" technology which accepts payment with palm recognition .

Once you've touched down at your destination companies like Boomerang  SITA  and Roadie will help you track recover and deliver your lost luggage.

We're all for a hassle-free flying experience but the use of biometric data and personal item tracking comes with privacy risks. False biometric identification (which is more prevalent amongst people of color and trans and nonbinary people ) and data breaches are factors to take into account. Plus the TSA biometric pilot is currently opt-in but programs like this often become the norm. ""We often see with these biometric programs that they are only optional in the introductory phases — and over time we see them becoming standardized and nationalized and eventually compulsory"" privacy advocate Albert Fox Cahn told the Washington Post.

Ultimately it's important to know what you're getting into — and giving away — for a slightly speedier experience.

2. Airbnb continuing its domination

In 2022 Airbnb turned lemons into lemonade. First it finally resolved the drama about the surprise cleaning fees that aren't added on until checkout. Now when you search for an Airbnb you have the option of seeing the total amount you would pay  with the cleaning fee included. For good measure Airbnb also had the final say on the growing trend of excessive cleanings requests from hosts: ""Guests should not have to do unreasonable checkout tasks such as stripping the beds doing the laundry or vacuuming when leaving their Airbnb. But we think it’s reasonable to ask guests to turn off the lights throw food in the trash and lock the doors — just like they would when leaving their own home.""

Second it finally solved the problem of landlords who banned tenants from Airbnbing their apartment. This had been a huge untapped market for Airbnb but it turns out cutting landlords in on the deal goes a long way. Now Airbnb has partnered with property management companies across the country to create the "" Airbnb-friendly apartments "" program. Renters can search the website for apartments that allow Airbnb rentals and see how much they could make as a host — after Airbnb and the landlord gets their cut of the profits. It's a pretty ingenious solution to help people offset the skyrocketing cost of rent that Airbnb contributed to in the first place .

Like or not Airbnb is going full speed ahead in 2023. With more transparent pricing and more potential Airbnb hosts the short-term booking platform is expected to be as prevalent as ever. Plus with travel and real estate prices on the rise it's all win-win for Airbnb.

3. Our favorite streaming shows inspiring us to get off the couch

If you found yourself wanting to book a trip to Sicily while watching Season 2 of The White Lotus despite all the scamming and murders you're not alone. Travel-related searches for the Italian island have skyrocketed since the second season launched. But this phenomenon isn't just exclusive to The White Lotus. According to Expedia's 2023 travel trends report 68 percent of US travelers wanted to visit a destination after seeing it in a streamed show or movie and 61 percent actually booked a trip.

Paris (Emily in Paris) the United Kingdom (Bridgerton and The Crown) New Zealand (The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power) and both Hawaii and Italy (thanks to the aforementioned The White Lotus with an assist from Searching for Italy) were all trending destinations in search and flight demand in 2022 with no signs of slowing down in 2023 per Expedia.

Sure these are mainstay favorites on the top travel destinations but the report also says streamed TV shows and movies are now the top sources of travel inspiration so it's hardly a coincidence.

4. Digital nomads are officially mainstream

Digital nomads have been around for a while but the surge of remote work during the pandemic has rocketed this lifestyle into the mainstream. Research shows that hybrid and remote employees have better work-life balance and are more productive  which has fueled more companies offering these policies.

Now that many workers are no longer location-dependent they're taking full advantage of the digital nomad lifestyle. And the remote work trend is expected to increase. According to Upwork  36.2 million Americans will work remotely by 2025 which is double the amount from pre-pandemic times (16.8 million). In fact Nomad List  a membership platform for digital nomads predicts by 2035 one billion people will be working remotely at least part of the year. Last year the platform reported over 4000000 users.

Early on digital nomadism was considered only for privileged twenty-something dreamers. ""You not only need a relatively powerful passport that makes tourist visas seamless to attain but also a knowledge economy job and access to the technology and devices that make remote working possible"" declared The Guardian back in 2015. But broadband continued to improve globally flights continued to get cheaper countries began offering remote work-friendly visas  and there was enough critical mass for digital nomad hubs and co-working spaces to start popping up.

Today according to Nomad List stats  digital nomads are 44 percent women 40 percent non-white an average of 33 years old and work a variety of jobs including marketing UI/UX design product management and yes software development.

Suffice to say being a digital nomad has never been more attainable.

5. Virtual and augmented reality boosts IRL travel

The pandemic brought travel and tourism to screeching halt which forced companies to get creative using virtual and augmented reality. ""Coming out the other side the same absorbing technology will be employed to enhance the visitor experience rather than replicate it"" said Euronews in its 2023 travel report.

VR/AR was quickly adopted to give sheltered-in-place consumers the virtual travel experience they were craving. Without leaving your house you could visit museums and explore sites like Machu Picchu And now it's also being used to help travelers research their next vacation spots as a way to ""try before your buy"" when choosing hotels and tours and even a way to book them. As VR/AR becomes increasingly more mainstream thanks to Meta's Quest lineup and Sony's PlayStation 5 (and maybe soon Apple?) offering consumer-friendly VR headsets expect to see more travel and tourism companies offering VR tours.

Hotel companies like Marriott Shangri-La and Holiday Inn are offering virtual tours of their rooms and companies like Beeyonder and Weezy have cropped up to offer immersive virtual travel experiences. Ultimately VR/AR for travel is being integrated into every step of the customer journey. Whether you're at home or visiting the real deal expect VR/AR to cross your path.

6. Getting back to nature in wild new ways (beekeeping!)

If you're sick of all of this tech talk you're not alone. People want to unplug and recharge — without their devices. After the past few years it's no surprise that travelers are prioritizing wellness. But they're not just looking for a visit to the spa. According to Hotels.com (which is owned by Expedia) 53 percent of US travelers in search of wellness activities want something exciting and new. ""The trend here is that the same old yoga retreat is out. People are looking for what we're calling a new wave of wellness"" said Melanie Fish Head of Global PR Expedia Group Brands at Expedia's event revealing its 2023 travel trends.

If you're looking for a wellness escape expect to see more hotels and tours offering activities like forest bathing (also known as sylvotherapy) foraging fruit harvesting and even beekeeping. Alternative wellness destinations are cropping up all over the world. Apparently the US is the top destination for millennials but Gen Z seems to be more adventurous preferring Norway Turkey Switzerland Iceland and Sri Lanka.

Whether you're a digital nomad who has made globe-trotting a way of life or an everyday traveler getting back in the swing of things after a break these tech trends will be hard at work behind the scenes wherever you are.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Though the businessman Martin Fierro paid as little as $1000 per month to lease 14.4 acres at one point real estate experts estimate each acre by itself could generate as much as $30000 to $50000 per month.

“It’s hugely valuable land and hard to find” said a developer who asked not to be identified because his company does work in Commerce and had not authorized him to speak on the matter. “There is a lot of demand for it because truck parking is a critical component to the supply chain.”

The largest of the lots in Commerce are rented by the city to Fierro without City Council approval or going out to bid. Estimates of the potential revenue generated from the sites indicate the city has potentially missed out on hundreds of thousands — if not millions — of dollars over the duration of the leases.

Few cities however want such parking in their communities because it “doesn’t create much employment and puts more trucks on the road” the developer said. Last year a transportation company agreed to pay $2 million in fees to Carson to offset the impact from its trucks parking on 60 acres of privately owned land.

Why demand is so high

The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are the two busiest in the country handling about 40% of U.S. imports and 25% of exports. Commerce is ideally located about 20 miles away has direct access to both the 5 and the 710 freeways and intersects with the region’s railways.

In 2021 after the ports ground to a halt Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered his staff to identify land owned either privately or publicly that could be used to “address short-term storage needs to address the supply and distribution chain crisis.” A February 2022 Caltrans study found that Los Angeles has the largest percentage gap between available parking and demand compared to other regions and needs to more than double its supply to break even.

Despite this some municipalities have opted to ban truck parking altogether due to citizen complaints about noise and traffic the study found.

The rows and rows of trailers tucked behind chain-link fences on Telegraph Road and Sheila Street suggest Commerce is helping lessen that gap though the city’s coffers and residents aren’t seeing the benefits.

Trucks in ‘every empty lot’

Leonard Mendoza a former councilman and mayor said he often hears concerns from residents that the city is turning into a parking lot. He could not recall voting on any leases for parking during his time in office.

“For the last two or three years it’s become an issue” Mendoza said. “Every empty lot is full of trucks.”

Mendoza said Fierro who also operates a swap meet in the city is well liked by the City Council because he gives back to the community. He regularly donates backpacks and other supplies to students in the Montebello Unified School District for example Mendoza said.

“Whenever any of his businesses come up he gets the thumbs up” Mendoza said.

In an interview City Manager Edgar Cisneros a former Montebello Unified School District board member said he has known Fierro for six or seven years but he denied that Fierro or his company Fenix Entrepreneur LLC get any special treatment.

“I don’t know how I met him he’s just a local business” Cisneros said.

Leases are temporary

Cisneros said the leases to Fierro are temporary and generate revenues while the city finalizes efforts to sell those properties to other parties including Citadel the nearby outlet mall. Having a tenant on the property helps deter homeless encampments and illegal dumping he said.

The fact that the sale might close any day now made it necessary to find a tenant who is willing to accept having to vacate on short notice Cisneros said. Moreover he said there isn’t as high of a demand for the properties because they aren’t paved and have restrictions on use during the holidays when Citadel needs the extra space.

Fenix’s low rental rates also factor in improvements it has made to the various sites including $525000 spent cleaning up debris and dirt illegally dumped on one of the Telegraph properties Cisneros said. Much of the available space wouldn’t exist if the Fenix hadn’t cleared the properties first he said.

“The lower rate was in consideration for the improvements the tenant made on the site” Cisneros said.

None of the improvements was required to go to the city for approval and Cisneros was unable to provide accounting or other documentation showing specific costs. The leases were processed administratively rather than going through the City Council due to their temporary nature and the pandemic he said.

In an email the city manager said the dollar figures for the improvements he provided were reported to him by the company and are consistent with bids the city previously solicited for the removal of the illegally dumped dirt. The city decided not to move forward with any of the project but it appears Fenix has since done the work on its own. Fierro was not one of the original bidders according to staff reports.

Aerial images taken by a photographer and obtained from Google Earth show both of the dirt lots rented to Fenix on Telegraph have been leveled to make more space for parking since 2020. A portion of the dirt on one of the properties was removed after the city settled with the illegal dumpers in late 2020 records showed.

The parking lots are authorized through temporary-use permits. The dirt lots operated by Fenix otherwise do not appear to conform to the city’s Municipal Code which requires parking operators to install lighting and pave every space with “asphalt concrete or Portland cement.” In its study Caltrans stated truck parking should have “essential amenities such as a paved and striped parking area restrooms water vending machines lighting green space and picnic tables.”

Fierro in an email echoed the city’s explanation for his low rental rates.

“Felix (sic) undertook a significant clean-up effort of the properties in question which placed my lease well within market range” he wrote. “I have spent a lot of money and time improving the properties and creating additional parking space for vital goods that our communities depend on during the height of the pandemic and the related supply chain disruption.”

He did not respond to additional questions.

Prices increased this year

Fenix began leasing 6007 and 6241 E. Telegraph Road from Commerce in 2021 for $1000 and $1700 per month respectively. Combined the two properties initially gave Fenix about 18.8 acres of land on which to store trucks and trailers according to the leases.

While these early agreements did not specify that Fenix had to make any improvements newer leases entered into earlier this year — after at least one individual made a public records request for information about the low rental rates given to the company — now state the rate is “in consideration of the fact that Licensee has cleared cleaned and improved and shall continue to secure and maintain” the property at no cost to the city.

“None of the other tenants have made improvements” Cisneros said. “They have saved us from that expense and that liability that’s something to consider.”

Both of the Telegraph properties are dirt except for about 3 acres of pavement on the lot at 6007 Telegraph.

New leases entered into in 2022 increased the total rent Fenix is paying for the two properties — with up to 26 acres available — to $15000 per month. The rent is slated to increase again to $35000 total per month in mid-2023 due in part to the demand for such properties Cisneros said.

If someone were to make a better offer Cisneros said the city would consider it after giving Fenix a chance to match it something it has done in the past.

“We consistently evaluate that” he said.

What they could be making

Eduardo Veronica a local truck driver operating in the area said he tried to rent space from the lot at the corner of Washington and Telegraph for two of his trucks in early 2021 but decided against it when he was told it would cost him about $450 per month per truck.

Fenix was renting about 4 acres there at the time for $1700 per month records showed.

“They were easily renting to a hundred trucks with tractor and trailer” Veronica said.

That’s about 25 trucks per acre — a lower amount than average for an acre — and would generate about $45000 per month in revenues at the prices quoted to Veronica. Assuming those prices haven’t changed and the space isn’t being better utilized now 25 trucks per acre at $450 per truck could mean Fenix is pulling in roughly $300000 per month from the 26 acres rented to the company today.

Cisneros said the city doesn’t monitor how many vehicles are stored or how much the tenant charges. Revenues aren’t factored into the rental rates he said.

“The City charges Jack-in-the-Box $8000 a month for the property it leases and doesn’t base it on their revenues” Cisneros wrote in a follow-up email. “The City doesn’t operate these businesses it holds property that is bound by existing purchase and sale agreements with private parties or that is slated for future development for either public use or housing.”

Doesn’t pass ‘smell test’

The deal between Commerce and Fenix doesn’t seem to pass the “smell test” for being above board said Neama Rahmani a former federal prosecutor who has served as director of enforcement for the Los Angeles City Ethics Commission.

“A grossly under-market rent especially in Southern California where rents are extraordinarily high is a huge red flag” Rahmani said. “$1000 rent for multiple acres is essentially free and makes no business sense. The public and prosecutors need to scrutinize this deal.”

Many small cities such as Commerce don’t have an independent watchdog agency to investigate public integrity complaints or robust citizen participation demanding accountability Rahmani said.

“People living in these cities get screwed” he added.

Other properties rented cheaply

The city’s rental history suggests it has given Fierro deals on other properties too.

In 2019 and 2020 Commerce charged FedEx $36000 per month to place 60 trucks on a roughly 2-acre lot on Sheila Street for three months during the holidays. But in between FedEx’s two seasonal leases Commerce rented a smaller portion of the site to Fenix for $3000 per month to store the exact same number of trucks according to a lease agreement and a staff report at the time.

The map attached to the lease indicated Fenix had access to two-thirds of the site when FedEx wasn’t using it but Cisneros alleges the space shown was inaccurate. Fenix was allowed to use only about 35000 square feet or roughly a third of the lot he said.

Fenix lost the Sheila Street property after another company XPO Logistics offered more according to Cisneros. Today XPO pays $38000 to use a little more than an acre of the lot.

Fenix didn’t have to pay a third of the price charged to FedEx however because according to Cisneros Fenix also made improvements on the Sheila property adding fencing lighting and stripes and removing junk and debris.

Google Street Views of the property show a fence around the perimeter and painted stripes for several years before Fenix rented the property though it appears someone added privacy screens to the fence sometime between 2019 and 2021.

The agreements with Fenix also were during a period “when there was no other use or interest in the site” and allowed the city to end the lease with only 10 days’ notice Cisneros said.

Fenix paid less than the tenants before and after it because it had a smaller portion of the site different terms a different time frame and “less certainty regarding use of the site” Cisneros said in an email.

The company behind the lots

Fenix Entrepreneur is a limited liability company formed in 2016 to act as a wholesaler and today lists its purpose as “general merchandise” according to filings with the state. Besides renting to trucks property records indicate the company has purchased eight residential properties in the past year-and-a-half.

The company’s business license places its headquarters at a home in Downey owned by Fierro.

The Secretary of State’s Office labeled it as “pending suspension” in March 2020 two months before Fenix began leasing the space from Commerce on Sheila Street.

On its most recent leases the company changed its address to 6046 E. Washington Boulevard an address previously listed for a cannabis company that was approved for cannabis manufacturing distribution cultivation and retail delivery. That previous tenant California Green World was one of 24 cannabis companies approved by the city though the East Washington address ultimately was rejected as a location for being too close to residences according to Cisneros.

Cisneros said he wasn’t aware of any connection between and Fenix and California Green World while Fierro said none exists. Fierro isn’t listed as having an ownership stake in California Green World’s application.

Yet the future cannabis business and Fenix used the same email address on city documents and elsewhere. California Green World’s owner Michael Pouras also registered the company with an address in Vernon that Fierro used for a different LLC with a similar name California Green Fields.

Responding from the email address in question Fierro stated that “Fenix has no business relationship with California Green World” but did not answer additional questions asking about the overlaps.

Public records suggest California Green World was quietly sold sometime after it received the city’s initial approval in 2019 but it’s unclear for how much.

The new owners were allowed to continue the process from where California Green World left off and have since received a development agreement to open a commercial cannabis business in the city according to the city’s website.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ2bmcuY29tL21pc3Rlci1jYXItd2FzaC10by1iZS1idWlsdC1vbi1zaXRlLW9mLWZvcm1lci1oZXNwZXJpYS1iYXItdGhhdC13YXMtZGVzdHJveWVkLWluLTIwMTUtZmlyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mister Car Wash to be built on site of former Hesperia bar that was destroyed in 2015 Fire,"Mister Car Wash to be built on site of former Hesperia bar that was destroyed in 2015 Fire

HESPERIA Calif. (VVNG.com) — Mister Car Wash received the ‘green light’ to proceed with the construction of a new car wash on Main Street providing even more options but this time at a spot that was home to a former bar that burned to the ground in 2015.

The 6464 square-foot automated car wash will sit on 1.3 gross acres of land located north of Main Street approximately 190 feet east of Jellico Avenue where the only memory left of the former Main Street Pub formerly the Rocks Club is a concrete slab and an old dilapidated sign.

(Site of the former Main Street Pub that was destroyed by fire in 2015 – Google Maps)

The new build will provide a fresh new look to the area while adding convenience to car owners and will be the first Mister Car Wash to open in the Victor Valley.

The project site contains two parcels; one of the parcels has an existing multi-tenant building that will be demolished as part of the development and the other parcel is vacant.

One of the tenants in the existing building to be demolished is Calling All Paws formerly the Funky Poodle according to Google Maps.

(Building that will be demolished to make room for the new car wash. – Google Maps.)

“The properties to the north and west consist of the Extra Space Storage facility which has several self-storage units throughout their site” a city document showed. “The properties to the south on the opposite side of Main Street consist of the Union Bank and Autozone service/retail buildings. The properties to the west are developed with a multi-tenant commercial building and Napa Auto Parts.”

(Rendings submitted to City of Hesperia)

The automated car wash building is proposed to be located at the center of the site with 3 drive-through entrance lanes on the east side of the building to accommodate a stacking of approximately 33 vehicles that will turn into a single lane.

There are 29 proposed vacuum spaces and 6 standard spaces on the west side of the building giving customers options to leave the site when exiting the car wash or make a U-turn into the vacuum spaces.

The easterly parcel of the site has an existing driveway approach that will be removed and replaced with a curb sidewalk and landscape. The site also has an existing 40-foot-wide driveway approach from Main Street that is shared with the property to the west and will remain in place. The site will also have an additional 40-foot-wide driveway approach from Main Street that will be shared with the property to the east.

(Aerial view of the parcels that will be split.)

The proposed 6464 square foot automated car wash is composed of the drive-through tunnel as well as an area for accessory equipment office space employee break room janitor area and restrooms.

The project also provides a surplus of landscaping the renderings showed meeting the minimum required landscape coverage in the Neighborhood Commercial (NC) zone.

The automated car wash proposes to operate from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Monday through Sunday needing only approximately 10 employees total with 2 to 4 employees per shift.

Drainage: Any additional runoff created on-site will be detained by a proposed underground storm drain chamber system to store the necessary volume on-site. Water and Sewer: The development will connect to an existing 12-inch water line located on Main Street and an 8-inch sewer line located north of the project site.

“Environmental: The project is categorically exempt from the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) by Section 15332 In-fill Development Projects. This exemption applies to developments on sites no larger than five acres which are consistent with the General Plan and are substantially surrounded by urban uses” a City document stated. “The project conforms to the policies of the City’s General Plan as well as the intent of the Specific Plan. In addition the proposed project will be an improvement to the site as it will eliminate the long vacancy of the building by architecturally enhancing the site and providing additional services for the residents of Hesperia.”

A representative on behalf of the applicant Cadence Southwest LLC telephoned into the meeting to participate.

“Good evening Planning Commissioners I just wanted to take this time to say thank you to Staff and their help in getting this project through. We’ve worked with them on not only the architecture but site layout and I think we have a pretty great site here it’s a great location and we’re excited to be coming to Hesperia” stated the representative who finished the call by asking the Hesperia Planning Commissioners if they had any questions.

“It’s a good-looking building that being said I have no other questions” stated Commissioner Member Raymond “Roger” Abreo.

There were no members of the public at the meeting to speak on behalf of the project.

The motion passed with a 3-0 vote with Commissioner Burke Abreo and Steeno in favor.

But Bertha was designed to accommodate a growing family. This beautiful tiny home is loaded with amenities: it has two lofts a triangular Juliette balcony that overlooks the living room a well-equipped kitchen and a bathroom with a shower/tub combo. It also offers storage galore!

This is one of those tinies that don't feel tiny at all. That's because it has a smart layout that incorporates tons of storage hacks and space-saving contraptions. Bertha was designed and built by Indigo River Tiny Homes a family-run business based in Texas. The company has been around since 2005. It started with small dwellings built on land and in 2017 it dipped its toes into the tiny movement.Since then it has designed various mobile habitats that maximize comfort and freedom. Bertha is a gorgeous home on wheels created for big families. It's the perfect tiny for Heather and Nathan who wanted to have a cozy cabin away from the chaos of the city. When they saw it they fell in love with the design of the house because on top of the clever layout it features an interesting exterior.In addition to the smart side siding Bertha has metal and cedar accents that make it stand out. Since the home was exactly what they wanted the two contacted the skilled team from Indigo River. To move it from Fort Collins to Florissant (the town where it's now located) Heather and Nathan had to get a special permit. That's because this is a park model which measures 32 ft (9.7 meters) in length. The home is also 10-ft-wide (3-meter-wide) and 13.6-ft-tall (4.1-meter-tall) so it's definitely on the bigger side.The beautiful dwelling is situated on a 2-acre property in Florissant. Nestled between the trees this private sanctuary is the perfect place to relax and get away from the hustle and bustle of city life. It's a great home for those who want to be closer to nature but also live big. This tiny manages to squeeze all the amenities a family of six needs into approximately 390 sq ft (36.2 sq meters).It has a cozy all-wood interior. Once inside it feels like you've stepped inside a log cabin. There are plenty of large windows that make the whole space seem even larger. On the main floor you have a beautiful kitchen equipped with apartment-size appliances. There's a refrigerator a deep stainless steel sink and a four-burner propane cooktop with an oven.You'll also notice that it includes a range hood and generous cherry wood countertops that offer owners all the space they need to cook up a storm. Speaking about space the kitchen features numerous cabinets and drawers that provide ample storage. It even has a drop-leaf table that can seat three people.Right next to the entryway is a beautiful solid cherry spiral ladder that leads to one of the two lofts. This area is great for guests or kids since it's separated into two spaces for privacy. There's enough room for a twin bed and cabinets with open shelving. Surprisingly it doesn't feel cramped at all. Plus there's even a triangular Juliette balcony that looks over the living room. It's a great addition that offers some extra space for storage. It also can be used as a hangout zone.The living room in this tiny is not that spacious but it feels really cozy. It's equipped with a large sofa that can be converted into a bed allowing two people to sleep comfortably. The sofa is placed right next to a large window that lets natural light come inside. It's a great spot to relax with friends and family and admire the views.In front of the couch you'll see a set of stairs with built-in storage. The stairs include numerous drawers that can be used to store away all the items that don't really have a place inside the house. The stairs lead to the master bedroom which is slightly bigger than the other loft. This one offers plenty of headroom allowing people under 6.4 ft (1.9 meters) to easily stand up and walk around the king-size bed. This area features full-size wardrobes as well.The bathroom is also pretty spacious. It is located under the master bedroom and it comes with a shower/tub combo and a laundry nook designed to host a washer/dryer unit. It also has a gorgeous vanity a standard flush toilet and some storage space. And if all that storage is still not enough Bertha also has two sheds on the outside. On one end it has what Indigo River calls a ""bike shed"" while at the opposite end it has a large utility closet.Many people who want to downsize their lives discover that they don't need much space to live comfortably and Bertha is a great example. The mobile habitat stands as proof that even with less space you can still enjoy all the amenities you'd find in a regular-sized home.Unfortunately the company doesn't mention a price for Bertha . That's because every house on wheels designed by the team Indigo River can be customized to match the preferences of future homeowners. If you want to get some inspiration or find out more about this beautiful 32-ft (9.7-meter) home you can watch the clip down below.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9nb29nbGUtcGhvdG9zLWRlbGV0ZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Everyone Is Using Google Photos Wrong,"Every year more than a billion people use the Google Photos app to upload and store billions of pictures and videos. For many the process is likely identical: You snap some photos with your phone and they’re automatically uploaded to Google’s cloud service. You might pick the best photo and share it on WhatsApp or Instagram and then never think about the rest of them ever again. The photos join a constantly updating stream of data about life.

But it shouldn’t be this way. Uploading thousands of photos and never taking any steps to sort or manage them creates a series of privacy risks and is making it impossible to maintain your photo collection in the future. Now is the time to stop being an information hoarder before it spirals out of control.

For the past six weeks I’ve spent around a dozen hours deleting thousands of photos that had been uploaded to my Google Photos account in the last half-decade. In total I erased 16774 photos and videos. During the process—and thousands of ""delete"" taps—three things stood out: My photos collection unknowingly includes a lot of sensitive personal information (both about me and others); I don't need to keep so many photos; and wrestling my collection into shape frees up a lot of space in my Google account.

My photo archive goes back to the early 2000s when everything was captured using an eight-megapixel digital camera. There are tens of thousands of photos—it’s impossible to say how many exactly—and they are entirely handled by Google. The photos were initially stored on CDs moved to Flickr before it limited collections to 1000 images and finally found their way onto Google Photos around 2018. When Google limited accounts to 15 gigabytes of storage I started paying for more.

Inside the collection family holiday shots sit alongside selfies. Food pictures and dog pictures are plentiful. As phone cameras have improved and cloud storage has become seemingly unending it appears that I take more photos every year. I am not the only one. Google Photos holds an unfathomable amount of data about us all: In 2020 the company said it stores 4 trillion photos with 28 billion new photos and videos uploaded each week.

Deleting thousands of photos was a manual tedious process. Using an iPad I scrolled through every photo I had backed up from the past 15-plus years and tapped each one that I wanted to send to trash. In one of the longer sessions I erased 2211 photos in 45 minutes. The majority of photos binned were duplicates: Instead of having 16 pictures of me running through a forest only the best two or three remain. Thousands of screenshots were culled: The moment I was verified on Twitter and the news article about a goat being arrested didn’t make it through the process unscathed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyY2hpdGVjdHVyYWxkaWdlc3QuY29tL3N0b3J5L3doeS1kby13ZS1sb3ZlLXNlY3JldC1yb29tc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Are We So Obsessed With Speakeasies Hidden Tunnels and Secret Rooms?,"Amidst chiming Teams or Slack notifications the strum of family togetherness and din that became de rigueur in lives spent at home some homeowners found relief and quietude in the form of hidden spaces—nooks niches deep closets and other similarly cozy spots—in which to collect their thoughts and catch their breath while shutting out the rest of the world. Retreating to a just-for-you space became as important a daily ritual as brushing your teeth. Even a modestly sized hideaway can evoke big calming effects on overexcited nerves no doubt due in part to its enveloping and womb-like environment. (However on the nose Cara Delevingne’s “vagina tunnel” may be the ultimate example of the trend.) Some people love to sleep in these spaces others prefer to read books and some others meditate in silent darkness.

Indeed what resonates with these secret spots is the fact that they are hidden generally camouflaged but still accessible and offer a quick escape from common gathering spaces. For many they’re not just a place of respite but somewhere to work imbibe entertain and store valuables. In some instances they might even become full-fledged rooms for activities like crafts or something more provocative where consenting adults are involved.

Speakeasies have had this concept nailed down since the days of Prohibition. And cataphiles or those urban explorers who intentionally roam the catacomb tunnels under the city of Paris know the allure and excitement of hidden passageways. This interest in covert spaces has only grown in recent times increasingly appearing in our home spaces and challenging architects designers and homeowners to thoroughly rethink the small spaces that may be hiding in plain sight.

Cathy Purple Cherry architect and principal of Purple Cherry Architects in Annapolis Maryland shares that it’s not unusual for clients to ask her team to conceptualize new ways to create veiled spots within their homes. Rule one: Never underestimate the power of a conversation starter. “These spaces create a unique experience that clients enjoy showing their guests” says Purple Cherry who recently masterminded a sweet children’s crafts room behind a spinning bookcase for a residence. In another project she worked with Annapolis based Pyramid Builders to engineer and fabricate a wood-paneled secret door that opens like an escape hatch from a spy novel.

Josh Linder of Boston design firm Evolve Residential says the charm is all in the “wow moment” that these hidden spaces afford. Currently the firm is endeavoring to create a bar that will pull out to reveal a hidden space behind it. “For me there is a certain childhood fantasy fulfilled every time I experience a hidden doorway. I could not possibly have imagined anything cooler when I was young and the experience still brings me joy” Linder says.

But don’t mistake this cleverness for child’s play. Turns out our need to escape at least some of the time is fundamental to the replenishment of energy and mental coolness explains Sarah Williams Goldhagen architecture critic and author of Welcome to Your World: How the Built Environment Shapes Our Lives. “One of the elements in both Attention Restoration Theory and Appleton’s Prospect-Refuge hypothesis is the notion that for a space to be restorative it needs to confer the sense of ‘being away.’ Now that so many people are working from home they need these kinds of ‘being away’ spaces more than ever: Such hidden enclaves encourage us to shift cognitive sets which is a necessary precursor to restoring energy gaining perspective and replenishing depleted attentional resources.”"
XOM,ExxonMobil,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YWJyb2VrbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8yNS9uZXdzL2d1eWFuYS9rZXktZXh4b24tYXVkaXQtc3RpbGwtaW4taXRzLWZpbmFsLXN0YWdlcy1vZi1hcHByb3ZhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Key Exxon audit still ‘in its final stages of approval’,"Three years since it was first completed and submitted followed by promises that it will be made public government says that the IHS Markit audit of ExxonMobil’s US$460 million pre-contract costs is still being reviewed by the company.

“The report is being submitted for review and is in its final stages of approval” Minister of Natural Resources Vickram Bharrat told the Sunday Stabroek when asked about the report.

It is about the sixth time over the two-year period that the PPP/C has been in office that he has given similar “final stages” responses.

The Natural Resources Minister did not explain why the review was initiated by ExxonMobil and whose approval has to be sought before it could be handed over to the Government of Guyana.

Back in February of this year Bharrat had said that the report had been in its finalisation stage so it remains unclear why some ten months after that statement it is still being finalised given that by comparison the entire audit of over US$7 billion in post-contract costs had a timeline of four months to be completed.

He would say again in late May that the report was being finalised even as auditing of post-contract costs had begun.

Bharrat contended then that the IHS report was coming to completion and that the post-contract audit agreement had to be signed before the IHS one could be closed as there needed to be some reconciling of expenses. “It is being completed. This one had to be signed first because there are some things expenses that had to be looked at…”

The IHS Markit audit will provide the first real insight into whether ExxonMobil has been making undue expense claims.

In the face of concerns that his administration has only paid lip service to transparency in its stewardship of the oil and gas sector President Irfaan Ali had in August of this year said that government is building a dedicated website to publish all available information. He would later tell this newspaper in an interview in September that he would check on the status of the audit.

“I have to follow up where this is and will definitely communicate” Ali had said.

The President has also said that a website dedicated to the oil and gas sector would be established for the public’s monitoring as his government had nothing to hide.

“I do not believe that we have been hiding anything as it relates to the oil and gas sector” he further contended as he claimed that “every piece of information that the government has every discussion we have had… has been made public and shared with the public.”

It is unclear as to the status of the website.

UPS said it had service outages in 898 zip codes across four states Monday and FedEx continues to expect delays throughout the day.

In Michigan New York Indiana and Ohio UPS said it would make no pickups or deliveries in the hundreds of postal codes it listed on its service alerts website. Although UPS said contingency plans are in place to help packages arrive as quickly as possible the company warned service disruptions persisted.

""Significant weather events across several regions of the US are impacting the UPS Air and Ground network including UPS hubs in Louisville Kentucky and Rockford Illinois"" the company said in a statement. ""As a result some delivery and pickup services in these areas will be affected.""

FedEx continued to warn that ""substantial disruptions"" at its Memphis and Indianapolis hubs would delay shipments across the United States. Like UPS FedEx said it had contingency plans in place to deliver packages in a timely manner. But the company said package delays would continue through Monday.

Amazon and the US Postal Service warned Friday that the winter storm disrupted operations in the final delivery days before Christmas.

President's Day was first established over a century since Washington was born in 1879.

However it wasn't until 1968 that the holiday was made a federal holiday after former president Lyndon B. Johnson signed it into law.

The federal holiday was celebrated on the 22nd every year until 1971 when it was officially changed to the third Monday of February.

The day has since been repurposed as a celebration of the birthdays of every president who has served the United States.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzI2L2RheS1hZnRlci1jaHJpc3RtYXMtc2FsZXMtc3RvcmUtaG91cnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart after Christmas sale hours: When Target Lowe's Best Buy open,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2022/12/26/day-after-christmas-sales-store-hours on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzI2L2RheS1hZnRlci1jaHJpc3RtYXMtc2FsZXMtc3RvcmUtaG91cnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8yNi9vcGVuLWNsb3NlZC1kZWMtMjYtY2hyaXN0bWFzLTIwMjItbWFpbC1iYW5rcy1zdG9jay1tYXJrZXQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Christmas Day 2022 Observed: What's open and closed?,"The halls have been decked and the carefully wrapped gifts are now ripped open (and many people will be discovering shreds of paper for the better part of the next week). But Christmas isn’t quite over yet.

Since Dec. 25 fell on a Sunday this year many people have an extra day off today.

If you’re hoping to take advantage of after Christmas sales that shouldn’t be too much of a problem. But if you’re trying to take care of business with your local (or federal) government office—or are hoping to trade stocks it’s going to be a bit more complicated.

Here’s a look at who’s open and closed on Christmas Day (observed) 2022.

Are banks open on Monday Dec. 26?

Christmas is a federal holiday and as such banks are closed. Since the holiday fell on a Sunday it’s being observed by the government today. You can however still use ATM machines to get cash or put money into your account.

Will there be any mail delivery on Monday Dec. 26?

Nope. The U.S. Postal Service does not operate on New Year’s Day. As for UPS and FedEx it’s not so cut and dry.

FedEx Ground Home Delivery and Ground Economy will all be operating. FedEX Express however will not be offered. UPS meanwhile will not offer domestic ground air or international service. Some UPS stores will be open however though you’ll want to call before you head there.

Is the stock market open on Monday Dec. 26?

The New York Stock Exchange Nasdaq and bond markets are all closed. Trading wil resume on Tuesday.

Are government offices open on Monday Dec. 26?

City county state and federal offices are closed. If you think yours is the exception it’s best to call and confirm.

Which retail and grocery stores are closed on Monday Dec. 26?

Pretty much none of them. Retailers that closed for Christmas took the day off yesterday. Whether you’re hoping to take advantage of clearance deals or restock your fridge you’ve got free reign."
FIS,Fidelity National Information Services,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyL2RlYy8yNS9hcmVuYS1maW5pc2hpbmctYmlnLXllYXItd2l0aC0xMzctZXZlbnRzLTI3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Arena finishing big year with 137 events $27 million in ticket sales,"Simmons Bank Arena is delivering robust results as one of the world's best-producing arenas in 2022 as the year draws to a close.

The multipurpose North Little Rock arena achieved record results this year offering 137 events with more than 315362 tickets sold at a gross margin of $27.4 million.

That performance gained Simmons international attention ranking 50th in the world according to data compiled by Pollstar a trade publication covering the concert and music industry.

As performers returned to the stage Simmons Bank Arena capitalized on the renewed activity which was above the 120 events the facility typically hosts each year. Many countries still had suspended or limited live events with thousands of attendees when bookings were made last year pushing many musicians and other performers to U.S. arenas like Simmons.

""It's been an awesome year"" said Michael Marion general manager of the arena. ""We've never done anything like this. We were able to book a lot of things because they were all staying here in the U.S.""

For example the arena hosted 23 comedy and musical performers in 2018 and 2019 pre-pandemic and held 37 last year. It also has annual bookings such as Monster Truck rallies the Harlem Globetrotters and Arkansas Razorback basketball games.

George Strait sold the most tickets more than 17608 even though others like Elton John sold out the facility. Strait performs in the round creating more seating area for fans.

Elton John was the first major performer in the arena in 1999 after its opening was delayed by 10 days due to structural issues which were found the same day the original opening event -- an NBA game showcasing the Los Angeles Lakers featuring Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant -- was canceled hours before tipoff.

The Pulaski County Multi-Purpose Civic Center Facilities Board has managed the arena since 2004 picking up management duties from a private company that ran the arena when it opened as Alltel Arena.

The name changed first in 2009 when Verizon purchased Alltel Corp. and gained naming rights to the facility. Verizon did not renew the sponsorship contract and Simmons Bank stepped up with a $10.5 million agreement in 2018.

One thing has remained consistent across the name changes -- Marion has been general manager from the very first day.

The entertainment arena provides concerts sporting events and meeting space for the Central Arkansas market.

Usage should return to normal levels in 2023.

""I think things will settle down next year"" Marion says. ""I don't think we'll see this kind of event load next year.""

ALLIANCE RUBBER RECOGNIZED

Alliance Rubber Co. which manufactures rubber bands in Hot Springs is one of eight companies cited by the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) as one of the nation's leading exporters.

The woman-owned company has been operating for nearly 100 years and also offers packaging and promotional products for use in the home and workplace. Alliance currently exports to 60 countries.

""EXIM is dedicated to facilitating the exporting success of U.S. small business as they compete globally"" said bank President and Chair Reta Jo Lewis. ""The eight exporters recognized this year have contributed greatly to fulfilling EXIM's mission of supporting American jobs by facilitating U.S. exports. Congratulations to each business!""

U.S. companies particularly small businesses use the bank's financing tools and resources to increase international sales showcase American-made products and create and sustain American jobs.

VENTURE CENTER WINNERS

A Cincinnati company that enhances peer-to-peer payment options for banks won the Demo Day award as the latest FIS Fintech Accelerator cohort at the Little Rock Venture Center ended last week.

""Partnerships make this possible. FIS and the state of Arkansas have been vital for ensuring collaboration between our organization the financial services industry and field experts in order to continue advancing fintech solutions for real-world problems.""

NWA HOT HOUSING MARKET

The Northwest Arkansas housing market of Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers has been touted by a national organization as one of the top real estate markets in the nation to watch in 2023.

The region is projected to be the fourth-best housing market next year by the National Association of Realtors which is predicting 4.78 million existing-home sales in 2023 down 6.8% from 5.13 million in 2022. The Atlanta metro area was projected to be the top-performing market.

""Half of the country may experience small price gains while the other half may see slight price declines"" said Lawrence Yun chief economist with the real-estate organization.

The national median home price will reach $385800 -- an increase of just 0.3% from this year which was $384500. Rent prices are predicted to rise 5% in 2023 following a 7% increase in 2022.

Mortgage rates which climbed above 7% this year fueled by interest-rate increases should settle down to 5.7% Yun said.

""The demand for housing continues to outpace supply"" Yun said. ""The economic conditions in place in the top 10 U.S. markets all of which are located in the South provide the support for home prices to climb by at least 5% in 2023.""

“We’re the largest bank in Iowa but we have not had a physical brick-and-mortar presence in Cedar Rapids” said Chip Reeves who became MidwestOne’s chief executive officer Nov. 1. “That will change in the first quarter of 2023.”

Reeves 55 talked with The Gazette about his connection with former CEO Charlie Funk the role of a community bank and the ways the industry is evolving.

Q: You were CEO of Beach Bancorp Inc. based in Florida and before that worked in the Pacific Northwest. Iowa has no mountains or oceans. What drew you here?

A: “It’s really a return to Midwestern roots and values. I grew up in Cincinnati Ohio and went to Miami of Ohio. My wife Michelle grew up in the northern suburbs of Chicago and also went to Miami. I worked 22 years with Fifth Third Bank which is primarily based in the Midwest.”

Q: With longtime MidWestOne CEO Charlie Funk’s August bike accident and rehabilitation have you had a chance to talk with him?

A: “I first spoke with Charlie about 2 1/2 years ago and we both enjoyed the dialogue even that long ago. We reconnected in March or April as Charlie announced his intentions to retire. Over these last two months I’ve been able to spend some quality time with him. He’s been an outstanding mentor and board member.”

Q: You have some other things in common right?

A: “Charlie is a tall individual who played basketball in college. I’m 6’7’’ and played basketball at Miami of Ohio. Charlie’s legal name is Charles. My legal name is Charles. My middle initial is actually ‘N’; so is Charlie’s. I spent five years in southwest Florida in Naples and I actually worked in the same building that MidWestOne is in there.”

Q: What structures or cultures did Funk put in place at MidWestOne Bank that made you want to lead the organization?

A: “Two things that I think are Charlie Funk’s legacy. One it’s a legacy of growth. When Charlie first became CEO of what was at that time Iowa State Bank it was probably only $300 or $400 million in size. Today MidWestOne across five states is worth $6.5 billion. The other is the culture and the values and our operating principles.”

Q: The movie “It’s a Wonderful Life” is popular this time of year. The Baileys were a banking family deeply integrated in the community and its needs. How much of being a bank CEO today is about being active in the community?

A: “It’s critical. It’s what separates us as a community bank. My wife and I have lived by those values throughout our lives. You’ll see me being extremely involved in the Iowa City/Cedar Rapids Corridor and community. I have meetings later this week and next week with the United Way of Johnson County with the school district here in Iowa City. I’ll be looking to become part of the Iowa Banker’s Association and many of our team members are incredibly intertwined with the community.”

Q: For a while it seemed like there were bank branches on every corner. Has that changed with more mobile banking?

A: “Why you are seeing less branches today is because the customer has chosen how they desire to interact with us for their normal daily banking. The transactions pieces have gone digital. That’s why we as an industry and we at MidWestOne have invested so much in our digital online experiences.

“What that also means is when a customer is visiting us in our branches or offices we have to be great bankers because most of that now is around specific events advice or solutions. We spend an incredible amount of time in education and training of our bankers and I think we have the best in the market.”

Q: Cryptocurrency is viewed by some as an alternative to traditional banks. To what degree have traditional banking institutions interacted with crypto and is there any intersection?

A: “If you look out to 2030 and 2040 digital currency will almost replace real currency. However the speculation of crypto or Bitcoin etc. I’ve always looked at that as a little bit of a Ponzi scheme. But the digital currency the payment systems that are coming from blockchain are absolutely here to stay. I believe we’ll ultimately see the Federal Reserve begin to step into the space and create a federal digital currency.”

Q: We’d love to hear about your family.

A: “I love to brag about my family. We have four children. They are boy girl girl boy: 26 24 22 and then we took 10 years off and have a boy who is 13 years old and will be relocating here to Iowa City with my wife Michelle.”

Kennesaw State will host Virginia-Lynchburg at Fifth Third Bank Stadium in Kennesaw Ga. on Saturday Nov. 11 2023. The game will mark the first-ever meeting between the two schools on the gridiron.

The game was originally scheduled for Nov. 4 2023 but was pushed back one week to Nov. 11 per a copy of an amendment obtained from Kennesaw State University via a state open records request.

Virginia University of Lynchburg is a historically black Christian university located in Lynchburg Va. The Dragons are a member of the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA).

Kennesaw State currently competes in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) but is transitioning to the Football Bowl Subdivision and will compete in Conference USA beginning with the 2024 season. The Owls were a member of the ASUN Conference in the FCS but were not included in the new ASUN-WAC partnership for the 2023 season.

As a result of their transition Kennesaw State will likely compete as an FCS Independent for the 2023 season which means they will need to schedule up to 11 contests without the aid of a conference. Based on prior contracts Kennesaw State has five games scheduled for next season plus the newly announced contest against VUL.

Kennesaw State was previously scheduled to open the 2023 season on the road against the Jacksonville State Gamecocks. However the Owls announced prior to their contest in 2022 that the contest was the “…last scheduled game between the two.”

Currently Kennesaw State is scheduled to host the Furman Paladins on Sept. 16 and the Tennessee State Tigers on Oct. 7. Road opponents include the Chattanooga Mocs on Sept. 9 Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles on Sept. 23 (confirmed by TTU) and the Charleston Southern Buccaneers on Sept. 30.

Kennesaw State’s final schedule as a member of the FCS is obviously a work in progress. We’ll bring you more on their 2023 slate as it develops.

Efficiency has been taken into consideration when designing the first solar car Lightyear 0.

The first solar-powered electric car to enter production is called Lightyear 0. The electric start-up has given Finland's Valmet Automotive the ownership for production. Almost all of the world's major automakers have used their vehicles in production. Valmet wants to provide full battery and vehicle manufacturing solutions to start-ups like Lightyear with the help of CATL as a partner.

Lighteryear 0: Specifications and features

Efficiency has been taken into consideration when designing the solar car. The body of the 0 has been made extremely slick with a drag coefficient of less than 0.175 in order to accomplish that. This is the lowest ever for a production car. As there is less resistance to the vehicle's motion this helps to maximise range.

Additionally solar panels have been installed on its body panels including the roof and bonnet. Those naturally recharge the battery every day if the sun is out. You won't need to charge it if you drive 50 km per day for months. Four separate in-wheel motors and a 60 kWh battery are included with Lightyear 0. This enables an acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h in just over ten seconds.

In favour of performance the top speed is supported to 160 km/h and the WLTP-certified range is 625 km. The thermal integration enables reusing the leftover heat to keep the vital components at the ideal temperature. The light chassis and body contribute to this. Also included is a battery pack with a high energy density.

Lighteryear 0: Price

The Lightyear 0 costs $262000 to purchase (approx Rs 2.16 Crore). This elevates it to the status of a luxury item but its convenience seems to be warranted. For those who reside in a sunny area they could potentially save a lot of money because the battery will be sufficiently charged for moderate daily use. I

n a few years Lightyear will release a smaller EV with the name 2 catering to those seeking for a more affordable alternative of the solar vehicle. Only 946 units of the 0 will be available for purchase.

Comparing the period between 2017 and 2019 with the period between mid-2021 and late 2022 Qatar increased its investment in renewables from 2% to 8% of overall energy investment. [Al Jazeera]

In recent months the Ukraine war has underscored the centrality of the debate on national and regional energy strategies to global economic and geopolitical security as well as the climate crisis. This paper looks at how three of the major Gulf energy actors – Saudi Arabia Qatar and the United Arab Emirates – have reacted to the pressures of recent geopolitical developments as well as the longer-term trend of the global shift towards cleaner energy. There are precedents for state actors including Gulf actors to focus in on the renewable energy sector as part of wider energy efforts during periods of uncertainty and instability across the international system. However since mid-2021 all three Gulf actors examined here have been much more active across the entire energy sector compared to any single year since the breakdown of intra-Gulf relations and the launch of the embargo of Qatar in 2017. (See Figure 1.)

Figure 1: 2017.7 - 2022.11 Number of deals made by Gulf major energy actors

Breaking down these activities further by sector between July 2021 and November 2022 (see Figure 2) all three energy actors made significant investments in both the gas and renewable sectors.

Figure 2: 2021.7-2022.11 Gulf energy major actors' energy related expenditure by sector

In the years immediately preceding this rising activity Qatar and Saudi Arabia made some large-scale domestic investments in renewables. Notably in November 2018 Saudi Arabia financed its first solar project in Sakaka with a capacity of 300MW. (2) Meanwhile in 2019 the first utility-scale wind farm in the Middle East the Dumat Al-Jandal wind farm was developed for the kingdom with a capacity of 400MW by Masdar and EDF Renewables.(3) In October 2019 the CEO of QatarEnergy Said al-Kaabi announced plans to capture and sequester 5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from its LNG export facilities by 2025. (4) The following January Qatar contracted French oil major Total and Japanese conglomerate Marubeni to build Qatar’s first utility-scale solar PV project (800MW) which came online in time for the November 2022 FIFA World Cup. (5)

In contrast with the exception of the 2013 Shams 1 solar farm whose capacity is 300 MW (6) and the second phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park commissioned in March 2017 with a capacity of 200 MW (7) the majority of the UAE’s involvement in renewables in the period prior to recent activity was overseas rather than domestically. For instance the UAE invested in one waste-to-energy facility in Australia; one solar plant in each of Mauritania Egypt and Jordan; and wind farms in the United Kingdom Montenegro the United States Serbia and Oman. Nevertheless even though the UAE was much more active overseas in this sector relative to Qatar and Saudi Arabia prior to 2020 Emirati investment in renewables still only accounted for approximately 3 percent of its total energy investment in this period. (See Figure 3.)

Figure 3: Gulf major energy actors' investment changes by sector; comparing the year from 2017.1 to 2019.12 with the year from 2021.7 to 2022.11

Since mid-2021 there has been a noticeable increase in the number of renewable projects and the size of relative investment in all three countries. From a base of only approximately 3 percent of its total energy expenditure prior to 2020 between July 2021 and November 2022 the UAE launched 8 major solar plant projects one natural gas-to-methanol project one waste-to-energy project one wind farm three blue ammonia projects four hydrogen projects and one decarbonisation initiative. Most recently during November 2022 the UAE and the US agreed to collaborate on clean energy projects globally with the goal of adding 100GW at a cost of US $100 billion by 2035. (8)

Saudi Arabia went from a base of nearly zero renewable investment before November 2018. However in the period between April 2021 and November 2022 it invested in eight solar plants five hydrogen projects three sustainable desalination projects one solar and wind power plant two wind farms and hydrogen projects. In August 2022 the kingdom announced a further plan to develop three renewable energy projects at a cost of US $10 billion in Uzbekistan. The following November the kingdom agreed to build a 10GW wind farm in Egypt.

Over this same time period Qatar built on its previous endeavours by launching two more solar plant projects two hydrogen projects and one project in each of the areas of decarbonisation and blue ammonia as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4: Gulf major energy actors’ renewables footprint timeline

In terms of the value of these projects in relation to the countries’ overall investments in all energy projects comparing the period between 2017 and 2019 with the period between mid-2021 and late 2022 Qatar increased its investment in renewables from 2% to 8% of overall energy investment. Renewables rose from 0% to 25% of total Saudi energy investment whilst in the case of the UAE they rose from 3% to 43% of all energy investment. (See Figure 3.)

The first explanation for this unprecedented move into the renewables sector is that these three Gulf energy actors are simply aligning themselves with global trends that are increasingly focused on addressing climate change priorities by transitioning to renewable energy. (9) In January 2021 Qatar announced plans to build out capacity for carbon capture and storage to 7 million tonnes per year by 2030. The following August QatarEnergy announced its intention to reduce its Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 25 percent by 2030. (10) In March 2022 QatarEnergy further announced its plan to achieve a reduction of 11 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year by 2035. (11) For its part in the final months of 2021 Saudi Aramco awarded contracts worth US $10 billion for the development of the vast Jafurah field as part of its goal of producing half of its electricity from gas and half from renewables in accordance with its 2060 net-zero target. The following month in December 2021 the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) announced its intention to expand carbon dioxide capture to 5 million tonnes per year by 2030. (12)

These are some of the very public announcements in recent times that reflect the goals set down in the relevant strategic vision documents of all three Gulf states. One of the pillars of Qatar’s Vision 2030 which was published in 2008 is the “Management of the environment such that there is harmony between economic growth social development and environmental protection.” (13) Since 2015 Qatar has aligned the outcomes and goals of its National Development Strategy with the goals of the United Nations’ (UN) Sustainable Development Agenda. Of the 247 goals set by the UN Qatar has managed to align with 199. Qatar’s sustainability targets include installing 2 to 4GW of solar power energy and to have 10% of all motor vehicles electric by 2030. (14)

For its part Saudi Vision 2030 which was announced in 2016 prioritises sustainable social economic and environmental development. It is committed to Saudi investment in at least 9.5GW of renewable energy by 2030 as part of its ongoing move out of fossil fuels and in support of wide-ranging economic diversification plans. In order to offset the environmental impact of these considerable development ambitions this vision also planned to launch more than 35 renewable projects across the kingdom by 2030. UAE Vision 2021 and Dubai’s Vision 2030 published in 2010 and 2016 respectively include sustainable development as a major pillar. According to a report by the influential US-UAE Business Council these visions form part of a wider Emirati plan to ensure that renewable energy accounts for a significant proportion of the country’s energy stock by 2050. (15)

This extensive re-focusing on renewables can also be regarded as one more component of the wide-ranging competition between Gulf actors across many geopolitical and economic fronts. For example as indicated in Figure 5 during the first year of the blockade of Qatar between June 2017 and June 2018 both Saudi Arabia and the UAE the two leaders of the embargo made significant increases in their investments in the natural gas and LNG sectors. In the Saudi case this occurred in the half year between July 2017 and May 2018; and in the case of the UAE it began in November 2017 and continued at high levels over the following two years.

Such heavy spending in these sectors during the most intense period of the embargo of Qatar was born out of desire to reduce gas dependence on Qatari LNG especially at a time when Qatar used its ongoing supply of gas to embargoing states to demonstrate its conciliatory and responsible position. But it also represented a decision at the time to challenge Qatar’s status as the leading regional actor in natural gas and LNG.

Interestingly once the embargo “normalised” somewhat in its latter stages investment in LNG by both Saudi Arabia and the UAE declined only to rise significantly once again when the embargo ended following a meeting of Gulf leaders in Saudi Arabia during January 2021. It is possible to explain this development not only in terms of the end of the blockade but also as a response to the growing emphasis being placed on the move towards cleaner energy from 2021 onwards.

Figure 5: Saudi Arabia and the UAE's investment in the gas sector (in USD million) during and after the blockade from 2017.7 to 2022

The end of the embargo of Qatar in early 2021 and the significant move into renewables subsequently served to intensify energy competition between Saudi Arabia the UAE and Qatar. All three have looked to establish themselves as the dominant regional player or challenge the dominance of the others in various parts of the wider renewable energy sector. Such intra-regional competition is only a secondary driver of the move into renewables. Nonetheless it is worth considering in the rapidly changing energy environment.

In June 2021 the CTO of Aramco Ahmad Al-Khowaiter announced his company’s intention to “have a large share of the market for blue hydrogen.” (16) A little under a year later in May 2022 Saudi Arabia also announced that it would build the largest green hydrogen plant in the Gulf in its hi-tech city of Neom. (17) The following October the kingdom announced its further intention to become a hub for green minerals as part of its plans to become the dominant global hydrogen supplier. (18) In June 2022 the Saudis also announced plans for the construction of the world’s biggest solar thermal plant intended to generate steam to make aluminium rather than produce electricity or enhance oil recovery. If this project comes to fruition it should dramatically reduce Saudi Arabia’s carbon footprint and bring it closer to achieving its net zero goal by 2060.

However it should be noted that over the last decade Saudi Arabia has announced several proposals to invest in solar power that have not come to fruition. This includes a 2011 plan to invest $100 billion in expanding power generating capacity including a nuclear plant and 5GW of solar energy capacity by 2020. This target was not reached. In 2015 Saudi Arabia also announced the launch of its first solar-powered desalination plant in Al Khafji but it only had a planned capacity of 15 MW. This was followed up in 2018 by the Saudi announcement of plans to build its first large-scale renewable energy project in Sakaka with a capacity of 300 MW. A number of other solar projects have been proposed by a variety of public and private sector actors in the kingdom over the years underscoring the ad hoc and uncoordinated nature of the Saudi approach up until recent times. It should be noted however that during this same time period construction did commence on a wind farm project at Dumat al-Jandal with a capacity of 400 MW. Meanwhile in late October 2022 Saudi Aramco’s CEO launched a US $1.5 billion sustainability fund one of the largest funds of its type globally to invest in stable and inclusive energy transition technology. (19)

Qatar on the other hand is currently looking to establish itself as a dominant actor in solar plants and blue ammonia. In August 2022 Qatar announced it would build the world’s largest blue ammonia facility. (20) The following October the country’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani inaugurated the Al Kharsaah Solar Power Plant in Al Kharsaah. This plant which covers 10 square kilometres and includes more than 1800000 solar panels is the first in Qatar and one of the largest in terms of size and capacity in the region with a total capacity of 800 MW. It is intended to satisfy 10% of the country’s peak electricity demands.

The UAE has looked to take a lead across a number of renewables sectors. In August 2021 Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber the Emirati Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and ADNOC Group’s CEO announced that the UAE’s would become “a regional leader in the production of hydrogen and its carrier fuels.” This he continued would be achieved through “the expansion of our capabilities across the blue ammonia value chain” as a way to develop a “legacy as one of the world’s least carbon-intensive hydrocarbon producers and support industrial decarbonisation with a competitive low-carbon product portfolio.” (21) This statement in particular is notable for the way it sought to assert Emirati leadership across the renewable space. In accordance with these ambitions less than three months later in October 2021 the UAE announced plans to invest more than US $160 billion to become the first Gulf state to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. (22)

This rapid progress in developing the renewable energy sectors over the last year both in terms of the number of projects launched and the overall spend has not only taken place domestically. As shown in Figure 6 all three countries have also entered the renewables sector overseas. Qatar has invested in hydrogen projects in the UK and acquired a large holding in a major US clean energy company. Saudi Arabia has invested in hydrogen production and carbon capture in China as well as one solar plant in Indonesia one wind farm and hydrogen project in Uzbekistan and one wind farm in Egypt. Meanwhile the UAE’s overseas renewables projects now include blue ammonia sales to Japan and Germany two hydrogen projects one each in the UK and Egypt and three wind farms one each in Poland Uzbekistan and Egypt. It has also signed agreements for solar projects with Armenia Georgia Azerbaijan Indonesia Iraq India and Tanzania and wind farm projects in Japan and Uzbekistan.

Conclusion

The major moves into the renewables sector between mid-2021 and late-2022 have not come at the expense of projects in the traditional areas of oil and gas. During September 2022 the President and CEO of Saudi Aramco Amin bin Hassan Nasser had a warning for those who “shame oil and gas investors dismantle oil-and coal-fired power plants fail to diversify energy supplies (especially gas) oppose LNG receiving terminals and reject nuclear power your transition plan had better be right.” (23) QatarEnergy‘s CEO Al-Kaabi made a similar point in an earlier television interview in May 2022: “You can’t achieve this energy transition without fossil fuels and the best fossil fuel to mankind is gas.” (24) Subsequently he expressed the view that “the best for the LNG industry is yet to come” and argued that more consumers are realising this vital fact. (25) To take one example in support of his position according to the findings of a March 2022 Pew Research Center poll while a majority of Americans support a move to carbon neutrality by 2050 only 31% think it is a good idea or realistic to phase out fossil fuels completely. (26)

It is also worth noting that recent moves into renewables are not only about addressing the climate crisis meeting national targets for energy transition or competing with local rivals in new areas of energy. They must also be understood as a move that is driven by market forces as traditional customers are increasingly looking to import renewable energy alongside more traditional forms of fuel. Speaking at the LNG Producer-Consumer Conference in Japan in early October 2021 Al-Kaabi explained that “successful energy transition cannot be driven by producers alone. It is a shared responsibility that requires the active collaboration of energy producers legislators and governments and end-consumers.” (27)

In accordance with such arguments in June 2020 the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) signed an agreement with Shell to become the first supplier to China of carbon-neutral LNG imports. The following September Saudi Aramco announced a zero-carbon fuel value chain with Japan alongside their first blue ammonia shipment to the country. The Japanese Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry played a central role in backing the 40 tonne shipment of ammonia that followed. In August 2022 Shell announced that it would set up a joint venture in Shanghai with the backing of Saudi Arabia to build Asia’s first hydrogen distribution network. For its part in August 2021 the UAE made 3 blue ammonia shipments to Japan. The following November South Korea’s GS Energy agreed to import 200000 tonnes of blue ammonia from the UAE. In September 2022 the UAE also completed its first shipment of low carbon ammonia to Germany.

Regardless of the different drivers behind these large scale moves into the renewables sector these actions may well result in these 3 pro-active and ambitious Gulf states establishing themselves as hubs for renewable energy while they also look to consolidate their positions in the ever-changing oil and gas markets over the medium and long term. They have in other words not only increased their commitment to renewables as part of the expansion of their overall energy portfolios. They have arguably much more importantly set themselves on a path that may ultimately locate them at the heart of the new energy system in areas such as hydrogen and blue ammonia like they did in the oil and LNG sectors over the last half century."

This time the safety helped the New Orleans Saints prevail 17-10 in Arctic-like conditions and officially eliminate the Browns from qualifying for the playoffs.

“That's Dirty Dan. That's what we call him” Browns running back Kareem Hunt told the Beacon Journal. “Dirty Dan he's always going to fly around to the ball make hits make plays. He's going to give it 110% each and every play and he's never afraid to back down from nobody. Dirty Dan's scrappy. He's got to be a little bit dirty chippy. He's one of those guys.”

Hunt knows Sorensen because they were teammates as members of the Kansas City Chiefs but other Browns players are familiar with him too. After all he's done enough to give them nightmares.

Saints' Daniel Sorensen familiar foe to Browns

During his Chiefs days Sorensen drilled former Browns wide receiver Rashard Higgins with a helmet-to-helmet hit as the latter dived for a pylon with the ball extended. Higgins fumbled through the end zone and out of bounds for a touchback with 1:34 left in the second quarter of the Browns' 22-17 divisional-round playoff loss on Jan. 17 2021 in Kansas City.

Then in the 2021 season opener at Arrowhead Stadium Sorensen tripped former Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield as he threw and cornerback Mike Hughes made the game-clinching interception with 1:09 remaining in Cleveland's 33-29 defeat.

On Christmas Eve Sorensen completed a hat trick against the Browns who are guaranteed a losing season because they fell to 6-9 and have just two games left.

In the midst of a rally by the Saints (6-9) and with the score tied 10-10 the Browns faced second-and-11 at the Cleveland 42-yard line when quarterback Deshaun Watson's pass deflected off receiver David Bell as the rookie dived for the ball. Sorensen intercepted the pass and returned it 36 yards to the Cleveland 15 where five-time Pro Bowl left guard Joel Bitonio tackled him.

Four plays later running back Alvin Kamara rushed for a 4-yard touchdown on first-and-goal. Wil Lutz's successful extra-point kick gave the Saints a 17-10 lead with 55 seconds remaining in the third quarter and the Browns failed to come back.

“He's been a thorn in our side” Bitonio said of Sorensen. “He's made some big plays and I think that's a testament to he plays hard he plays the game the right way and I'm sure he has some good film study. I mean there's a little bit of luck in there too where the ball tips and [he's in the right place at the right time] but he's made the plays when he's had an opportunity and that's a testament to his film study and the way he works and plays hard.”

Browns vs. Saints second-coldest home game in Cleveland history

With the Browns playing their second-coldest home game in franchise history — 6 degrees at kickoff with a real-feel temperature of minus-16 — Watson went 15-of-31 passing (48.4%) for 135 yards with the interception for a rating of 47.1.

A third-round pick in April's draft Bell said the ball “was like a brick” because of the temperature but explained he still should have caught it and therefore took responsibility for the turnover.

“[Watson] placed the ball where it's supposed to be at and the opportunities that I get I just gotta make them” Bell told the Beacon Journal. “Knowing that I get limited opportunities throughout the game anytime the ball comes to me I have to catch it. So it's completely on me.

“It hit my hands and as a receiver anytime the ball hits your hands you've gotta come down with it no matter the conditions no matter what's going on around you. That's the whole point of playing receiver is being able to dial in on the ball and catch the ball. If you're an NFL receiver you obviously got here for a reason — to be able to catch the ball. So I take full blame for that one.”

Sorensen's takeaway essentially negated an interception the Browns had turned into a touchdown in the first half.

After the Browns went three-and-out on each of their first three possessions safety Grant Delpit provided a spark by intercepting a third-down pass thrown by Saints quarterback Andy Dalton and returning it 40 yards to the New Orleans 30 with 2:44 left in the opening quarter.

Five plays later Watson rushed for a 12-yard touchdown and the Browns gained a 7-0 advantage with 14:55 remaining in the second quarter.

“It was huge” Browns safety John Johnson III said of Delpit's second interception this season. “I was teasing him because in Carolina when he got an interception [in Week 1] me and him were on the wrong sides. It happened again today. I ended up in man to man. Usually I'm the deep guy and he got another one. So I was teasing him about it but it's huge. He's playing around the ball. I think he's been playing high-level football so I'm happy for him.”

“Each week [Delpit is] getting better and better getting more comfortable with the defense making a lot of plays” Browns safety Ronnie Harrison Jr. added. “He's doing a great job right now flying around. I feel like he's finally feeling himself back there a little bit. That's good for him.”

Delpit also stuffed Kamara a five-time Pro Bowl selection for no gain on third-and-2 to force a punt in the third quarter.

“He plays with passion and fire every snap” Browns cornerback A.J. Green said. “That's something I credit to him. If you go out there and play with your hair on fire eventually some plays will come to you and he made the plays when they came to him.”

Yet Sorensen's interception and what followed spoiled Delpit's glory.

“It's just always good to make plays” Delpit said. “Everybody knows everybody's potential and we can all be great so it's good to see that in motion. We just gotta finish games.

“This is a team sport. It's not an individual sport. This is not golf or tennis. So we have to finish as a team.”

Finishing has been a consistent problem for the Browns and Sorensen is well aware of the theme.

Jayson Tatum and Giannis Antetokounmpo lead their respective teams into the third of five holiday matchups on Sunday.

The Bucks and Celtics carry the NBA’s two best records into their first meeting of the season. If it’s anything like last season’s playoffs it should be one heck of a Christmas present to NBA Fans. Tatum and Antetokounmpo are both in the thick of the early MVP race but who has the upper hand right now?

At 5 p.m. Eastern on Christmas Tatum and Antetokounmpo will face each other for the first time since the Celtics outlasted the Bucks in a thrilling seven-game playoff series. It was a series that homecourt advantage meant very little and you could expect the unexpected.

The Bucks had a golden opportunity to close out the series at home in Game 6 but Tatum played the best game of Boston’s grueling postseason run. The Celtics star went for 46 points to lead the visiting Celtics to a 108-95 victory and force a Game 7 back in Boston.

Tatum was spectacular from start to finish. He had struggled throughout the series. In his three previous games Tatum shot 5-for-27 from three-point land. In the pivotal Game 6 he went 7-for-15 from beyond the arc and 17-for 32 in the game.

Antetokounmpo was steady throughout the series. With Khris Middleton out the Greek Freak was forced to do more than normal. The Celtics/Bucks game is the centerpiece of the Christmas matchups this year. The list of holiday games are as follows:

New York Knicks vs. Philadelphia 76ers – 12 p.m. ET (ABC/ESPN)

Dallas Mavericks vs. Los Angeles Lakers – 2:30 p.m. ET (ABC/ESPN)

Boston Celtics vs. Milwaukee Bucks – 5 p.m. ET (ABC/ESPN)

Golden State Warriors vs. Memphis Grizzlies – 8 p.m. ET (ABC/ESPN)

Denver Nuggets vs. Phoenix Suns – 10:30 p.m. ET (ABC/ESPN)

The Joker continues to rise 👀



Check out the latest @Kia MVP Ladder: https://t.co/MjFikuPFc7 pic.twitter.com/8UhjZiE0U6 — NBA TV (@NBATV) December 23 2022

Tatum and Antetokounmpo are always near the top of the early MVP conversation. Two weeks ago Tatum held the lead in the Kia MVP rankings. The Celtics had the best record in the NBA at 21-5 but then things took a turn as they wrapped up a six-game road trip.

After double-digit losses to the Golden State Warriors and Los Angeles Clippers the Celtics trailed the LA Lakers by 13 points with less than four minutes to play but mounted a late rally to pull out an overtime win. When they returned to TD Garden for a seven-game homestand they lost the first three games.

Milwaukee has been much more consistent. Antetokounmpo has led the way by averaging a career-high 31.4 points. He’s also putting up 11.3 rebounds ad 5.2 assists.

Tatum is averaging 30.5 points 8.1 rebounds and 4.1 assists. Boston’s recent slump sent him down a couple of spots in the latest Kia MVP rankings putting him behind Antetokounmpo and Denver’s Nikola Jokic.

For now Antetokounmpo is the right choice. He’s the better player on a more consistent team but as we’ve seen a lot can change in a matter of weeks.",,,

If you want to see more stocks in this selection check out 5 Best Farmland and Agriculture Stocks to Buy.

Kenneth Scott Zuckerberg lead analyst and senior economist with CoBank's Knowledge Exchange division told S&P Global Commodities Insights in an interview in August 2022 that farmers and customers around the world may have to face a turbulent market well into 2023 given the upside risks to the prices of agricultural commodities and inputs. Prices of primary crops like corn soybean and wheat have been accelerating due to the Russia-Ukraine war weather constraints and supply chain bottlenecks. According to Zuckerberg the Russia-Ukraine war will impact the supply of grain and oilseeds for three or more years as Ukraine is one of the world's largest producers of corn wheat and sunflower oil and the war has tightened the supply of these commodities meaningfully.

High energy costs have also made the production of fertilizers costly. Lately fertilizer prices have normalized relatively. Yet the likelihood of natural gas supply challenges in the European Union from Russia can result in a steep increase in gas prices and costs of fertilizers. Zuckerberg further noted:

""If they [Russia] pull supply natural gas prices go up ... it means fertilizer prices go up and we have a restart to the inflation regardless of what the central banks are doing on interest rates.""

Given that China is one of the biggest producers consumers and importers of food and grains in the world Zuckerberg explained that:

""I think we can't ignore the China-Taiwan situation because once somebody tells you their intention it is really important to remember that.""

Farmland and agriculture stocks are likely to continue to boom given the uncertainties in the sector will not tamper with the global demand for agricultural inputs and commodities. Investors usually prefer to invest in farmland and agriculture stocks because of their diversification and inflation hedge characteristics. Billionaire Bill Gates is the #1 private farmland owner in the United States. Some of the best agriculture stocks to invest in include The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) and Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) according to hedge funds. Gladstone Land Corporation (LAND) is a pure play farmland stock that owns and acquires farm-related properties in the US however it failed to make our list because there were only 8 hedge funds with bullish positions in the stock.

The earlier downgrade was due to his belief that the stock's valuation had gotten ahead of the story but FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) has executed well which helped derisk its earnings progression the analyst told investors in a research note.

Here is what Aristotle Capital Management Global Equity has to say about FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:

“FMC is an agricultural sciences company providing solutions for the protection of crops from different pests. Its products are used by farmers to ensure bugs weeds and fungi do not negatively impact their harvest. Headquartered in Philadelphia Pennsylvania the company has a rich history dating back to 1883 when inventor John Bean set out to build a better insecticide spray pump. Over the decades through acquisitions FMC became a disparate collection of chemical companies. FMC has transformed itself to solely focus on crop chemicals having acquired DuPont’s crop chemicals portfolio in 2017 and completed the separation of its lithium business in 2019. FMC is now one of the largest patented crop protection companies globally. Its presence is balanced both geographically around the world as well as from a crop exposure standpoint with soybeans being the largest at roughly 20% of total revenue. In terms of products FMC’s portfolio skews toward insecticides which account for over 60% of its revenue. The remainder are herbicides (~25%) as well as fungicides and other crop chemicals (~15%). High-Quality Business Some of the quality characteristics we have identified for FMC include: Attractive Valuation We believe FMC’s current stock price is offered at a discount to our determination of the company’s intrinsic value given our estimates of both enhanced margins and higher earnings on a normalized basis. Compelling Catalysts Catalysts we have identified for FMC which we believe will cause its stock price to appreciate over our three- to five-year investment horizon include:

FMC is poised to benefit from its focus on crop chemicals as yield gains are needed to support rising food consumption in emerging markets;

Continued margin improvements from its product pipeline. These new products should be particularly effective against insects weeds and fungi that have grown resistant to traditional crop chemicals; and

Further cross-selling of FMC products to DuPont customers. For example in Argentina 78% of the customers it gained from the DuPont acquisition were unique to FMC providing cross-selling opportunities.”

Both big domestic brands have largely eliminated passenger cars in favor of trucks and SUVs so classic confrontations between them are fewer than before. Enthusiasts can still cling to the Camaro versus Mustang face-offs—for now. But in terms of big-time where-the-money-is competition nothing is more telling than Silverado vs. F-150.

The three best-selling models in the United States are full-size pickup trucks. The Ford F-150 ranks number one and has for decades. The Chevrolet Silverado—a long-time number two to the F-150—now ranks third with the relative upstart Ram 1500 coming between it and the Ford. Import brands which increasingly dominate car and crossover SUV segments continue to struggle to make headway against the domestic three-headed monster when it comes to full-size trucks.

Since the big pickups deliver serious sales and profits to their manufacturers it doesn't take a gain-of-function scientist to figure out that their manufacturers are eager to keep the sales and profits flowing with innovations and new tech. A simple example is that big pickups have some of the largest and most elaborate infotainment screens. They also offer a lot of variety which if you haven't heard is the spice of life.

Truck buyers care about utility payload towing economy of operation comfort and style. Ford and Chevy execs know the hot buttons well and they labor every day to make sure their trucks are hitting the mark. Their livelihoods and the fate of the companies that employ them depend on it.

The Chevrolet Silverado got a major ""refresh"" for the 2022 model year. Most importantly the interior received a significant rework that brought it up to contemporary standards. The Ford F-150's last major redesign came for the 2021 model year and it was a big one too. Virtually all areas of the truck received some attention with an emphasis on comfort convenience and infotainment.

Yet the more things change the more they stay the same. (You can write that down if you like.) A big pickup truck does the same basic jobs today that it did in 1960. People use them for hauling towing and general utility work. And it can inflate the ego of the person who drives it.

A significant shift came with the relatively recent growth in popularity of 4-door cab configurations creating vehicles that can seat six. Because of that innovation many full-size pickups are the primary vehicle of their family used for everything from toting lumber from the home improvement store to taking the kids to baseball practice. Both the Chevrolet Silverado and the Ford F-150 offer choices of cab styles bed lengths engines and drive wheels to accommodate just about everything a truck buyer would like to do. Both will tow and haul with aplomb so hitch up that Airstream.

This comparison is a close look at nuance—minor advantages here minor issues there. Further it would be silly to pretend that brand loyalty reputation and exterior styling have nothing to do with consumers' choices. The smart move is to look at all the objective data key in expert criticism and analysis and then buy the one you want. To help you with that decision here is a comparison of the 2023 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and the 2023 Ford F-150.

Price and Value 2023 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 High Country The 2023 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 lineup includes seven trim levels: WT Custom LT RST LTZ High Country and ZR2. There are off-road-oriented Trail Boss versions of the Custom and LT trims. Chevrolet offers three cab configurations (Regular Cab Double Cab and Crew Cab) but the Regular Cab is only available in WT trim. In this instance WT stands for ""work truck"" and Chevy at least partially aims the Custom at commercial truck buyers. The Silverado is essentially a personal and/or dual-use truck from the LT grade up. Chevy equips both the Double Cab and Crew Cab versions of the Silverado to seat up to six—three on a modular front bench and three on a more conventional bench in the rear. Many buyers eschew the front semi-bench and choose twin bucket seats. The rear-seat accommodations in the Crew Cab are superior to the Double Cab. The Regular Cab will provide cozy seating for three across a vinyl or cloth bench seat. The rear-drive WT Regular Cab with the standard-length bed is the least expensive 2023 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 with a manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) of $38195. One could view the rear-drive Custom Double Cab as a plusher work truck or a bargain basement consumer vehicle. With a power-adjustable driver's seat and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto among its step-ups from the WT it has a base MSRP of $45495. The addition of part-time 4-wheel-drive (4WD) brings the suggested price to $48795. The popular mid-level LT trim starts with a rear-drive Double Cab model at $53195. The V8-powered performance-style RST Crew Cab has a base MSRP of $54895 and the off-road-oriented Custom Trail Boss 4x4 Crew Cab has a base MSRP of $53695. The LT Trail Boss—another 4x4 but with LT level equipment—bases at $59895 with the turbocharged 2.7-liter 4-cylinder engine and $62260 with the 5.3-liter V8. And the mid-luxe rear-drive LTZ Crew Cab has a starting MSRP of $59095 with the 5.3-liter V8. The High Country is the most luxurious Silverado with items like open-pore wood interior trim. In 4WD form with the more powerful 6.2-liter V8 engine it has a starting suggested list price of $69940. Choosing stand-alone options and an equipment package or two can run the total cost of all these trucks up by $10000 or more. On the specialty front the Chevrolet Silverado ZR2 is a recently introduced off-road-oriented specialty truck. It features High Country-level equipment plus the ZR2 suspension a 6.2-liter V8 engine mud/terrain tires on 18-inch wheels and skid plates. With a starting MSRP of $73395 it comes only as a Crew Cab short bed 4x4. All 2023 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 trucks are subject to a $1895 destination fee. Like the Silverado the 2023 Ford F-150 comes in a full range of trim levels: XL XLT Lariat King Ranch Platinum and Limited. Beyond those trims there are three specialty versions: Rattler Tremor and Raptor. With the availability of three cab types (regular extended crew) multiple powertrain choices and four wheelbase lengths the F-150 offers customers options regardless of their needs. Both rear-wheel drive (RWD) and 4WD are widely available across the lineup. And the Rattler Tremor and Raptor give off-road enthusiasts pre-packaged choices. The Ford F-150 XL Regular Cab is the least expensive 2023 F-150 model with an MSRP of $34445. In base form the XL has a 3.3-liter V6 engine 10-speed automatic transmission 17-inch steel wheels cloth seats vinyl floor covering and Sync 4 infotainment system. Among the mainstream versions the XLT Super Crew (crew cab) has a suggested base price of $48450. With the turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 engine its price increases to $51185. The Lariat takes the F-150 in a personal-use direction. A Lariat Super Crew with the base turbocharged 2.7-liter V6 and 4WD has a suggested list price of $61270. The King Ranch which features a 5.0-liter V8 has an MSRP of $63005. The Platinum trim also has the 5.0-liter V8 standard and an MSRP of $64695. The Limited (base MSRP $84910) is the most luxurious trim with a hybrid drivetrain featuring a turbocharged 3.5-liter V6. The F-150 specialty off-road variants are the Rattler Tremor and Raptor. The Tremor ($60970) authenticates its off-road prowess with 33-inch all-terrain tires and unique shocks. The Raptor has heavy-duty skid plates Fox Racing shocks 34-inch all-terrain tires plus off-road tech like Trail 1-Pedal Drive and Trail Turn Assist. It has a $76775 base MSRP. All 2023 Ford F-150 pickups carry a $1795 destination charge. Advantage: Ford F-150

Performance and Efficiency 2023 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 ZR2 Bison The 2023 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 offers truck buyers four engine choices: a turbocharged gasoline 4-cylinder two gasoline V8s and a 6-cylinder turbodiesel. The base engine is a turbocharged 2.7-liter 4-cylinder that delivers 310 horsepower and 430 pound-feet of torque. Chevy teams it with an 8-speed automatic transmission. The most-used V8 is a naturally aspirated 5.3-liter that offers 355 hp and 383 pound-feet of torque. The more powerful V8 displaces 6.2 liters and produces 420 hp and 460 pound-feet of torque. Both V8s feature cylinder-deactivation technology for added fuel efficiency. The 3.0-liter 6-cylinder turbodiesel engine delivers 277 hp and 460 pound-feet of torque. The two gasoline V8s and the turbodiesel work with a 10-speed automatic transmission. Compared to its Ford and Ram competitors the fuel economy of the Silverado 1500 isn't particularly impressive. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mileage ratings for the 2023 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 with the turbo-4 and RWD are 19 mpg city/22 mpg highway/20 mpg combined. The Silverado 1500 with the 5.3-liter V8 and RWD has EPA-estimated ratings of 16 mpg city/20 mpg highway/18 mpg combined. The higher-displacement 6.2-liter V8 comes in select 4x4 models. It earns EPA ratings of 16 mpg city/20 mpg highway/17 mpg combined. The fuel economy and overall range leader is the turbodiesel. The EPA-estimated fuel economy of a Silverado 1500 turbodiesel with RWD is 24 mpg city/29 mpg highway/26 mpg combined. And it has a range of 624 miles on a tank of fuel. According to the EPA the 4WD-equipped Silverado ZR2 specialty off-roader which employs the 6.2-liter V8 has estimated fuel economy of 14 mpg city/17 mpg highway/15 mpg combined. With its base turbocharged 2.7-liter 4-cylinder the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 can tow up to 9500 pounds. Some versions of the Silverado with the 6.2-liter V8 will tow as much as 13300 pounds. The 2023 Ford F-150's base 3.3-liter V6 produces 290 hp and 265 pound-feet of torque. Ford matches it with a 10-speed automatic transmission. The turbocharged 2.7-liter V6 makes 325 hp and 400 pound-feet of torque. The lone remaining mainstream V8 delivers 400 hp and 410 pound-feet of torque. The 3.0-liter 6-cylinder turbodiesel engine has a rating of 250 hp and 440 pound-feet of torque. The turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 is the budget-priced ""performance"" engine. It offers 400 hp and 500 pound-feet of torque. The hybrid powertrain with the 3.5-liter V6 brings 430 hp and 570 pound-feet of torque. The Ford Raptor features a 350-hp offshoot of the 3.5-liter turbo V6 and the Raptor R has a 700-hp supercharged 5.2-liter V8. The EPA says an F-150 with the turbocharged 2.7-liter V6 engine and RWD will deliver an estimated 18 mpg city/25 mpg highway/21 mpg combined. Equipped with the turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 the rear-drive version of the F-150 has EPA-estimated fuel efficiency ratings of 18 mpg city/24 mpg highway/21 mpg combined. The addition of 4WD knocks the fuel efficiency down one mpg with both engines. The base naturally aspirated 3.3-liter V6 is EPA-rated at 19 mpg city/24 mpg highway/21 mpg combined. The Ford Raptor with the 3.5-liter high-output turbo V6 has EPA ratings of 15 mpg city/18 mpg highway/16 mpg combined. The Raptor R with the supercharged V8 gets 10 mpg city/15 mpg highway/12 mpg combined. With the base engine the 2023 Ford F-150 has a maximum towing capacity of 8200 pounds but it grows substantially to as high as 14000 pounds. Several versions of the F-150 will tow 12000 pounds or more. Advantage: Ford F-150

Infotainment and Technology 2023 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 ZR2 Bison Infotainment is an area of heated competition among the major truck manufacturers. Neither Chevrolet nor Ford is shying away from the fray. Quite the contrary they are embracing the trend by offering ever-larger and more sophisticated infotainment systems and displays on their big trucks. The infotainment systems in the low-line WT and Custom trims of the 2023 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 are basic. Yet even those offer the availability of wireless Apple CarPlay and wireless Android Auto. Starting with the LT trim the infotainment offering gets much more impressive. It includes Chevrolet Infotainment 3 with Google built-in a 13.4-inch multi-touch display AM/FM/SiriusXM satellite radio Bluetooth streaming audio wireless Apple CarPlay and wireless Android Auto. Chevy's upgraded infotainment system provides customizable entertainment and vehicle feature settings and controls. It also offers the capability of using and controlling smartphone apps. This system with the 13.4-inch touchscreen extends through the top-of-the-line High Country and specialty ZR2 trims. Unlike the Ford F-150 and Ram 1500 the Silverado does not currently offer a name-brand premium audio option. The well-regarded Sync 4 infotainment system is standard across the extensive 2023 Ford F-150 lineup. The base XL has an 8-inch capacitive touchscreen with swipe capabilities AM/FM radio Apple CarPlay Android Auto wireless phone integration and AppLink applications. FordPass Connect enables a wireless hotspot for up to 10 devices. A 12-inch touchscreen is standard starting with the Lariat trim. The display includes an ""Information on Demand"" panel and connected navigation. The voice-command system accepts natural-voice requests eliminating the need to memorize particular phrases. On the premium audio front an 8-speaker Bang & Olufsen sound system is standard in the King Ranch and Platinum trims. The Limited trim's B&O ""Unleashed"" sound system has an astounding 18 speakers. Advantage: Ford F-150

Comfort and Utility 2023 Ford F-150 Raptor R The 2023 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and the 2023 Ford F-150 are each available in three different cab configurations with multiple wheelbases and bed lengths. The regular-cab models are most often commercial rather than personal-use trucks and are best suited to two occupants although three workers can find room in the modified bench seats. The extended-cab Silverado Double Cab and F-150 SuperCab offer up to 6-passenger seating but the rear seating areas are not as generous as in the Silverado Crew Cab and the F-150 SuperCrew. If you plan to use the rear seats often the two crew-cab configurations are the best choices possessing significantly more legroom than their extended-cab counterparts. The most noticeable change to the Silverado in recent years was the 2022 ""refresh"" that featured a completely new interior. Interestingly the big changes only applied to the LT and higher trims while the more commercial-oriented WT and Custom stood pat with the previous interior design. The new interior kicked the looks and functionality up several notches. One important difference is the installation of a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and driver information center. The top-of-the-heap High Country edition got special attention in an attempt to catch up to the interior luxury of the Ram 1500 and Ford F-150's top trims. The High Country has attractive open-pore wood trim and rich leather upholstery. And though it is not precisely an interior item the Silverado's available Multi-Flex tailgate sets it apart from competitors. As the bestseller in the category the F-150 lineup offers a wide variety of choices. While even the base F-150 interior is attractive well-designed and functional the level of sophistication and the quality of the materials depends on the trim level. Commercial-oriented F-150s like the XL can have crank-operated windows and vinyl floor covering which is sensible for their use. The F-150s designed for dual commercial-personal use or personal use alone have interiors similar to mid-level and upscale SUVs. In trims like the King Ranch Platinum and Limited the interior style materials and convenience features perfectly keep with their luxury-vehicle prices. The F-150 also offers interesting and innovative features like the folding shift lever that allows you to use the center console area as a desk or lunch table. Also the fully reclining front seats let you catch a comfortable nap. Advantage: Ford F-150",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL21vc3QtcmVsaWFibGUtdXNlZC1waWNrdXAtdHJ1Y2tzLXlvdS1jYW4tYnV5LXVuZGVyLTUwMDAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Most Reliable Used Pickup Trucks You Can Buy Under $5000,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL21vc3QtcmVsaWFibGUtdXNlZC1waWNrdXAtdHJ1Y2tzLXlvdS1jYW4tYnV5LXVuZGVyLTUwMDAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

New York Attorney General Letitia James' massive fraud lawsuit against Trump is currently scheduled to go to trial in Manhattan in October 2023 — and Trump himself could end up personally testifying.

The lawsuit seeks to bar Trump and his family from doing business in New York State and alleges that the Trump Organization fraudulently exaggerated its worth by billions of dollars for years to obtain loans. Trump responded in turn by suing James alleging she abused her position of power by investigating him.

Experts previously told Insider's Laura Italiano to expect an ""eye-glazing"" slog of litigation before the scheduled trial in New York State Supreme Court next fall predicting that Trump's team will fight tooth and nail to delay the matter. That could include potential attempts to swap judges and heel-dragging over motions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2RlYWxzLXJlY2Vzc2lvbi1ob2xseXdvb2Qtc2VsbGVycy0xMjM1Mjg2NTU0L9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2RlYWxzLXJlY2Vzc2lvbi1ob2xseXdvb2Qtc2VsbGVycy0xMjM1Mjg2NTU0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hollywood’s Deal Dilemma for 2023: Go Big or Wait Out the Downturn?,"This December the general mood on Wall Street is that next year will not see an explosion of major transactions along the lines of the ones that created Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) Paramount Global or Disney’s takeover of large parts of 21st Century Fox assets.

After all companies like the David Zaslav-led WBD are still focused on making prior megadeals work and others are waiting for what is perceived as a more favorable regulatory environment amid increased antitrust scrutiny. All entertainment companies are dealing with such challenges as accelerated cord-cutting and the advertising fallout of recession fears. Higher interest rates and decreased access to capital are also potential obstacles for M&A. Plus sector stocks are depressed making agreements on price tags particularly difficult. “Consolidation has been a theme in media due to the combination of rising content intensity in streaming and well-known declining linear trends” Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall wrote in a Dec. 20 report. “In 2023 we don’t expect any major media deals.”

However under pressure some players could well look for transforming moves after all. “As we look to 2023 higher interest rates and inflation coupled with growing geopolitical tensions and regulatory oversight will require dealmakers to refine their portfolio strategies and be more intentional about deal value creation” consulting giant PwC wrote in a late 2022 deals report. “The media and telecommunications sector may fare better than others as it sits at the center of many sectors’ investment patterns and growth strategies.”

Below are the Hollywood firms that could see M&A interest in the new year — along with a few longer-shot possibilities for deals like Disney that could fundamentally alter the Hollywood studio landscape.

AMC’s ‘The Walking Dead’ Josh Stringer/AMC

The studio has been increasingly viewed as an acquisition target after ending its most popular series The Walking Dead in November and forecasting company-wide layoffs and “cuts to every operating area” later that month. Executive Chairman James Dolan explained the cuts by saying that the company’s streaming ventures which include AMC+ Acorn TV and Shudder hadn’t been able to balance out the impact of cord-cutting losses at the company which owns cable networks AMC IFC and Sundance TV. AMC Networks has also said it will take $300 million to $400 million in write downs on content coming from a mix of “owned and licensed content which will no longer be in active rotation on the Company’s linear or digital platforms.”

All of this comes as CEO Christina Spade left the company at the end of November after taking the position in September. Dolan has stepped up as interim executive chairman as AMC searches for a successor.

AMC Networks has been hoping the launch of its new series Interview With a Vampire alongside spinoffs of The Walking Dead and other new programming such as Mayfair Witches can help fill in the holes left from the departure of its biggest franchise as well as the end of popular shows Killing Eve and Better Call Saul. But with advertising headwinds alongside a rise in cord-cutting and smaller streaming services (which have been growing subscribers but still pales in comparison to the giants) it may face an uphill battle. — Caitlin Huston

Disney

Among entertainment companies Disney is the 800 lb gorilla (er mouse?) in the room. Unlike all of its competitors with lineages that trace back to cinema’s golden age Disney is the one studio that never sold itself. It acquired other business certainly with CEO Bob Iger the architect of some of its biggest deals (Pixar Marvel Lucasfilm) and a product of another (Capital Cities/ABC) but unlike Universal NBC Fox ABC CBS Paramount Pictures MGM (the list goes on…) Disney was always a buyer not a seller.

Could that era be over? Could this “increasingly complex period of industry transformation” to use the words of Disney board chair Susan Arnold necessitate a pivot? Could Iger’s time-limited return mean that he’s seeking a deal?

As far-fetched as it may have seemed just a few short years ago a Disney sale is suddenly not crazy even if the list of potential buyers is short (Apple and … Apple?) but a Disney split: Sending the ABC TV network ABC News and ESPN to another corporate home or their own new company is far more plausible. The “precipice” facing traditional TV (those are Iger’s words spoken at the Recode conference 3 months ago) is steep and if Disney is focused on a streaming future jettisoning its linear businesses may be the most rational thing to do.

As for an outright sale? There is no entertainment company on earth with the intellectual property reach and brand devotion of Disney. Any company interested in the space with deep enough pockets would covet the company’s holdings while its unmatched theme park business gives it real-world interactions with tens of thousands of people daily all using cutting edge tech to bring those stories to life.

As Steve Jobs famously said it is “technology married with the liberal arts married with the humanities that yields the results that makes our hearts sing.” When you look at it that way the biggest technology company acquiring the biggest company in the humanities makes a whole lot of sense. — Alex Weprin

eOne

After less than three years at Hasbro the toy giant is looking to to unload the film and TV production and distribution unit. J.P. Morgan and Centerview Partners are leading the auction for eOne which has a film and TV library with around 6500 titles and a branded film and scripted TV business that produces and finances content like Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves The Woman King Yellowjackets and The Rookie franchise. In mid-November Hasbro first announced it was exploring a possible sale of eOne. Any possible sale of eOne will see Hasbro retain Peppa Pig and other key properties acquired when the toy maker acquired the Toronto-based indie studio in 2019 as part of a $4 billion all-cash transaction. Hasbro shedding eOne should a deal be completed aims to allow the company to focus on branded assets like Peppa Pig Transformers and Dungeons & Dragons as it looks to be become a digital games giant. Any move to sell part or all of eOne to reinvest in fewer more profitable properties and to do so with outside partners to reduce costs and risk has been applauded by Wall Street investors. — Etan Vlessing

EA’s ‘Madden 23’

What is the future of entertainment? It may or may not involve the “metaverse” but one way or another it is likely to be interactive. Video games are already a gigantic business and if traditional entertainment companies want to compete in the future games are likely to be a part of it.

Already Netflix is developing games and interactive content and many traditional studios have dabbled in the space. But with antitrust scrutiny likely to make deals to buy other streamers or networks tough why not go big and outside the box and target one of the industry’s biggest players?

Electronic Arts controls the strongest brand in sports gaming EA Sports including the Madden NFL franchise. It produces the Battlefield Need for Speed and The Sims franchises (all ripe for reimagining as films or TV shows) and it inked a deal with Disney to develop games based on that company’s IP notably the Star Wars franchise.

Speaking of Disney if Iger wants to pull off one last mega-deal EA could certainly fit the bill giving the company instant scale and credibility in gaming an area Disney has never succeeded in.

It was a move contemplated by another deal-hungry conglomerate earlier this year: Comcast which weighed merging EA with NBCUniversal until deal talks fell apart over valuation.

With Activision Blizzard off the market (at least until the Microsoft deal is decided one way or another) Epic Games effectively a founder-controlled company and Nintendo a difficult takeover target for an American company given Japanese regulatory rules EA is probably the ripest takeover target in the gaming space. The question now is who’s in the game? — Alex Weprin

Brian Grazer and Ron Howard Courtesy of Imagine Entertainment/Jeff Lipsky

The past year and a half saw private equity firms nabbing stakes in A24 Legendary Pictures LeBron James and Maverick Carter’s SpringHill and Kevin Hart’s Hartbeat banner while asset manager Blackstone rolled up stakes in Reese Witherspoon’s banner Hello Sunshine and Will and Jada Pinkett-Smith’s Westbrook Media and Brad Pitt’s Plan B sold a majority share to French conglomerate Mediawan. Ron Howard and Brian Grazer’s Imagine Entertainment could be among the next major indie Hollywood firms generating interest.

The firm founded in 1986 after Grazer and Howard collaborated on Night Shift and Splash went on to forge a 30-year relationship with NBCUniversal’s Universal a partnership that included such acclaimed features as A Beautiful Mind Apollo 13 American Gangster and Frost/Nixon and blockbusters like Liar Liar and The Da Vinci Code. In 2016 as the Universal deal ended Imagine secured a $100 million-plus investment from merchant bank The Raine Group with an eye toward emerging media including branded content. A year later Imagine launched a television joint venture with a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based TVB with TVB Venture investing $100 million to co-finance projects.

In film the company partnered with digital studio Animal Logic in 2018 to develop and finance a series of animated and hybrid animation/live-action features including Paramount’s The Shrinking of Treehorn which has a Nov. 2023 release date. Imagine bought Jax Media the producer of Emily in Paris (Netflix) and Full Frontal With Samantha Bee (TBS) and it made a further investment in nonfiction buying a significant stake in 2020 in Alex Gibney’s Jigsaw Productions the banner behind titles like Theranos doc The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley (HBO). In 2021 Imagine struck a multi-year first-look deal with Apple to develop a slate of scripted feature films. Other recent deals have included a bet on podcasting with a division Imagine Audio that inked an exclusive slate deal with iHeartMedia to launch six new series. — Erik Hayden.

Lionsgate’s ‘John Wick’ has turned into a multiplatform franchise. Courtesy of Lionsgate

Will a new wave of M&A in 2023 engulf Lionsgate? The studio has long coyly played buyer and seller most recently as it considers a spin-off of Starz or an outright studio sale. But after purchasing a 20 percent stake in the Spyglass Media Group and around 200 film titles Lionsgate is starting to look a lot like MGM as investors eye its giant library of franchises like John Wick Hunger Games and Saw for a Big Tech player doing its own pivot to streaming and hungry for content. Not that Lionsgate minds having a takeover target on its back. “We’re obviously one of the last remaining very large independent companies and there’s great scarcity value out there” Lionsgate vice-chairman Michael Burns told an investors conference in Sept. 2021. During an earlier consolidation wave in 2017 Hasbro eyed the Vancouver- and Santa Monica-based studio as prey before acquiring Entertainment One a company it’s now selling. While giving no timing on a Starz or studio transaction as part of strategic alternative Lionsgate is hoping growth for Starz’ streaming offering especially internationally TV series placed across all major networks and many more in development and a movie slate that includes a Hunger Games prequel and the John Wick-spinoff Ballerina will grease the wheels for possible M&A. Of course complicating Lionsgate’s dealmaking playbook is whether its studio assets or Starz is ultimately spun-off the studio wants to retain control as it looks to increase the value of its stock price and minimize its tax obligations. — Etan Vlessing

Paramount

Paramount’s ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ Courtesy of Paramount Pictures

Paramount Global smaller than its streaming rivals under CEO Bob Bakish has long been considered a takeover target for bigger fish a prospect only strengthened by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway building its stake in the Hollywood studio in recent months. With top-flight steaming platforms like Paramount+ and Pluto TV and a market cap at $11.2 billion and a stock price in the $17 range Paramount is seen as a ripe target for bigger streaming rivals like Apple Comcast or Warner Bros. Discovery or Big Tech players looking to enter the film TV and digital media space. Controlled via its class A shares by National Amusements the holding company run by Shari Redstone the Top Gun: Maverick studio just isn’t seen as having the scale — it had 67 million global streaming subscribers as of its last earnings tally — to prevail in streaming wars against Netflix and Disney+ just as digital viewing options and content costs rise sharply into 2023. And while Paramount formerly known as ViacomCBS has CBS that network is less of the cable TV juggernaut it once was amid cord-cutting and an advertising slowdown. Hence Paramount doubling down on streaming. — Etan Vlessing

Shane Smith and Nancy Dubuc Craig Barritt/Getty Images

The brash and youth-centric company that once had ambitions of replacing legacy news giants is now settling into middle age and looking for new financing. After a period of rapid growth in the 2010s — the company went from a $1.4 billion valuation in 2013 when 21st Century Fox paid $70 million for a 5 percent stake to $5.7 billion four years later when private equity firm TPG led a funding round of $450 million — Vice Media has gone through rounds of cost-cutting and layoffs. Vice’s biggest swing may have been plans for a major linear TV undertaking with Viceland a cable news brand that took the place of A+E Networks’ channel H2 and aimed at distribution in 70 million homes. But Viceland contrary to the vision of replacing cable news stalwarts like CNN or MTV never fully took hold as a linear TV channel.

101 Studios’ ‘Yellowstone’ Courtesy of Paramount+

The studio behind cable’s biggest hit Yellowstone is an attractive target in an industry clamoring for successful IP in a saturated content market. 101 Studios which was launched by former Weinstein Co. exec David Glasser in 2018 with $300 million in backing from investors including Ron Burkle quickly made a splash with $28.5 million deal for the first and second seasons of Taylor Sheridan’s modern Western drama starring Kevin Costner. Now in its fifth season Yellowstone continues to break viewership records with its dedicated following. And the new prequel 1923 starring Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren was the most-watched series premiere on cable this year drawing 4.12 million viewers to Paramount Network. 101 also boasts several other starry projects — like the Jessica Chastain-Michael Shannon limited series George & Tammy Jeremy Renner-led Mayor of Kingstown and Sylvester Stallone’s Tulsa King — and houses Sports Illustrated Studios. — Ashley Cullins",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZm94NGtjLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jZXJuZXItaGFzLXB1dC00LTFtLXNxdWFyZS1mZWV0LW9mLW9mZmljZS1zcGFjZS1vbi1rYW5zYXMtY2l0eS1tYXJrZXQv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3g0a2MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Nlcm5lci1oYXMtcHV0LTQtMW0tc3F1YXJlLWZlZXQtb2Ytb2ZmaWNlLXNwYWNlLW9uLWthbnNhcy1jaXR5LW1hcmtldC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cerner has put 4.1M square feet of office space on Kansas City market,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://fox4kc.com/business/cerner-has-put-4-1m-square-feet-of-office-space-on-kansas-city-market/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZm94NGtjLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jZXJuZXItaGFzLXB1dC00LTFtLXNxdWFyZS1mZWV0LW9mLW9mZmljZS1zcGFjZS1vbi1rYW5zYXMtY2l0eS1tYXJrZXQv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3g0a2MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Nlcm5lci1oYXMtcHV0LTQtMW0tc3F1YXJlLWZlZXQtb2Ytb2ZmaWNlLXNwYWNlLW9uLWthbnNhcy1jaXR5LW1hcmtldC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL25ld3MvdWsvdG9tLWhvbGxhbmRlci1nYWJyaWVsLWJ5cm5lLWlkcmlzLWVsYmEtamotYWJyYW1zLWhvbGx5d29vZC1iMjI1MTUyNS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Boy The Mole The Fox And The Horse most watched BBC show on Christmas Eve,"For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emails Sign up to our free breaking news emails Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers events and updates from The Independent.

The TV adaptation of Charlie Mackesy’s bestselling illustrated book The Boy The Mole The Fox And The Horse was the most watched BBC programme on Christmas Eve the corporation said.

An average of four million people tuned in to watch the author and illustrator’s distinctive images reimagined with hand-drawn traditional animations for the BBC One short film about kindness friendship courage and hope.

Mackesy told the PA news agency: “It’s difficult to find words to say how I feel about this news.

“I’m very moved and grateful that so many watched it. I really hope they enjoyed it. Thank you so much everyone – I could never have dreamt of this.”

The film enlisted Hollywood star Idris Elba as the voice of the fox and Tom Hollander whose credits include The Night Manager and Bohemian Rhapsody as the mole.

Veteran Irish actor Gabriel Byrne featured as the horse and newcomer Jude Coward Nicoll was the boy.

The short film was produced by Star Wars director JJ Abrams and Hannah Minghella of Bad Robot Productions with an original score by composer Isobel Waller-Bridge sister of Fleabag star Phoebe.

The Boy The Mole The Fox And The Horse was published in 2019 and explores the friendship between the four titular characters as they journey together in search of a home.

After its publication it was named book of the year by Waterstones and was shortlisted for the British Book Awards’ non-fiction lifestyle book of the year.

Mackesy 59 previously worked with Nelson Mandela on a lithograph project The Unity Series and also helps support a honey social enterprise in Zambia.

Discovery (WBD) Paramount Global or Disney’s takeover of large parts of 21st Century Fox assets.

After all companies like the David Zaslav-led WBD are still focused on making prior megadeals work and others are waiting for what is perceived as a more favorable regulatory environment amid increased antitrust scrutiny. All entertainment companies are dealing with such challenges as accelerated cord-cutting and the advertising fallout of recession fears. Higher interest rates and decreased access to capital are also potential obstacles for M&A. Plus sector stocks are depressed making agreements on price tags particularly difficult. “Consolidation has been a theme in media due to the combination of rising content intensity in streaming and well-known declining linear trends” Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall wrote in a Dec. 20 report. “In 2023 we don’t expect any major media deals.”

However under pressure some players could well look for transforming moves after all. “As we look to 2023 higher interest rates and inflation coupled with growing geopolitical tensions and regulatory oversight will require dealmakers to refine their portfolio strategies and be more intentional about deal value creation” consulting giant PwC wrote in a late 2022 deals report. “The media and telecommunications sector may fare better than others as it sits at the center of many sectors’ investment patterns and growth strategies.”

Below are the Hollywood firms that could see M&A interest in the new year — along with a few longer-shot possibilities for deals like Disney that could fundamentally alter the Hollywood studio landscape.

AMC’s ‘The Walking Dead’ Josh Stringer/AMC

The studio has been increasingly viewed as an acquisition target after ending its most popular series The Walking Dead in November and forecasting company-wide layoffs and “cuts to every operating area” later that month. Executive Chairman James Dolan explained the cuts by saying that the company’s streaming ventures which include AMC+ Acorn TV and Shudder hadn’t been able to balance out the impact of cord-cutting losses at the company which owns cable networks AMC IFC and Sundance TV. AMC Networks has also said it will take $300 million to $400 million in write downs on content coming from a mix of “owned and licensed content which will no longer be in active rotation on the Company’s linear or digital platforms.”

All of this comes as CEO Christina Spade left the company at the end of November after taking the position in September. Dolan has stepped up as interim executive chairman as AMC searches for a successor.

AMC Networks has been hoping the launch of its new series Interview With a Vampire alongside spinoffs of The Walking Dead and other new programming such as Mayfair Witches can help fill in the holes left from the departure of its biggest franchise as well as the end of popular shows Killing Eve and Better Call Saul. But with advertising headwinds alongside a rise in cord-cutting and smaller streaming services (which have been growing subscribers but still pales in comparison to the giants) it may face an uphill battle. — Caitlin Huston

Disney

Among entertainment companies Disney is the 800 lb gorilla (er mouse?) in the room. Unlike all of its competitors with lineages that trace back to cinema’s golden age Disney is the one studio that never sold itself. It acquired other business certainly with CEO Bob Iger the architect of some of its biggest deals (Pixar Marvel Lucasfilm) and a product of another (Capital Cities/ABC) but unlike Universal NBC Fox ABC CBS Paramount Pictures MGM (the list goes on…) Disney was always a buyer not a seller.

Could that era be over? Could this “increasingly complex period of industry transformation” to use the words of Disney board chair Susan Arnold necessitate a pivot? Could Iger’s time-limited return mean that he’s seeking a deal?

As far-fetched as it may have seemed just a few short years ago a Disney sale is suddenly not crazy even if the list of potential buyers is short (Apple and … Apple?) but a Disney split: Sending the ABC TV network ABC News and ESPN to another corporate home or their own new company is far more plausible. The “precipice” facing traditional TV (those are Iger’s words spoken at the Recode conference 3 months ago) is steep and if Disney is focused on a streaming future jettisoning its linear businesses may be the most rational thing to do.

As for an outright sale? There is no entertainment company on earth with the intellectual property reach and brand devotion of Disney. Any company interested in the space with deep enough pockets would covet the company’s holdings while its unmatched theme park business gives it real-world interactions with tens of thousands of people daily all using cutting edge tech to bring those stories to life.

As Steve Jobs famously said it is “technology married with the liberal arts married with the humanities that yields the results that makes our hearts sing.” When you look at it that way the biggest technology company acquiring the biggest company in the humanities makes a whole lot of sense. — Alex Weprin

eOne

After less than three years at Hasbro the toy giant is looking to to unload the film and TV production and distribution unit. J.P. Morgan and Centerview Partners are leading the auction for eOne which has a film and TV library with around 6500 titles and a branded film and scripted TV business that produces and finances content like Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves The Woman King Yellowjackets and The Rookie franchise. In mid-November Hasbro first announced it was exploring a possible sale of eOne. Any possible sale of eOne will see Hasbro retain Peppa Pig and other key properties acquired when the toy maker acquired the Toronto-based indie studio in 2019 as part of a $4 billion all-cash transaction. Hasbro shedding eOne should a deal be completed aims to allow the company to focus on branded assets like Peppa Pig Transformers and Dungeons & Dragons as it looks to be become a digital games giant. Any move to sell part or all of eOne to reinvest in fewer more profitable properties and to do so with outside partners to reduce costs and risk has been applauded by Wall Street investors. — Etan Vlessing

EA’s ‘Madden 23’

What is the future of entertainment? It may or may not involve the “metaverse” but one way or another it is likely to be interactive. Video games are already a gigantic business and if traditional entertainment companies want to compete in the future games are likely to be a part of it.

Already Netflix is developing games and interactive content and many traditional studios have dabbled in the space. But with antitrust scrutiny likely to make deals to buy other streamers or networks tough why not go big and outside the box and target one of the industry’s biggest players?

Electronic Arts controls the strongest brand in sports gaming EA Sports including the Madden NFL franchise. It produces the Battlefield Need for Speed and The Sims franchises (all ripe for reimagining as films or TV shows) and it inked a deal with Disney to develop games based on that company’s IP notably the Star Wars franchise.

Speaking of Disney if Iger wants to pull off one last mega-deal EA could certainly fit the bill giving the company instant scale and credibility in gaming an area Disney has never succeeded in.

It was a move contemplated by another deal-hungry conglomerate earlier this year: Comcast which weighed merging EA with NBCUniversal until deal talks fell apart over valuation.

With Activision Blizzard off the market (at least until the Microsoft deal is decided one way or another) Epic Games effectively a founder-controlled company and Nintendo a difficult takeover target for an American company given Japanese regulatory rules EA is probably the ripest takeover target in the gaming space. The question now is who’s in the game? — Alex Weprin

Brian Grazer and Ron Howard Courtesy of Imagine Entertainment/Jeff Lipsky

The past year and a half saw private equity firms nabbing stakes in A24 Legendary Pictures LeBron James and Maverick Carter’s SpringHill and Kevin Hart’s Hartbeat banner while asset manager Blackstone rolled up stakes in Reese Witherspoon’s banner Hello Sunshine and Will and Jada Pinkett-Smith’s Westbrook Media and Brad Pitt’s Plan B sold a majority share to French conglomerate Mediawan. Ron Howard and Brian Grazer’s Imagine Entertainment could be among the next major indie Hollywood firms generating interest.

The firm founded in 1986 after Grazer and Howard collaborated on Night Shift and Splash went on to forge a 30-year relationship with NBCUniversal’s Universal a partnership that included such acclaimed features as A Beautiful Mind Apollo 13 American Gangster and Frost/Nixon and blockbusters like Liar Liar and The Da Vinci Code. In 2016 as the Universal deal ended Imagine secured a $100 million-plus investment from merchant bank The Raine Group with an eye toward emerging media including branded content. A year later Imagine launched a television joint venture with a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based TVB with TVB Venture investing $100 million to co-finance projects.

In film the company partnered with digital studio Animal Logic in 2018 to develop and finance a series of animated and hybrid animation/live-action features including Paramount’s The Shrinking of Treehorn which has a Nov. 2023 release date. Imagine bought Jax Media the producer of Emily in Paris (Netflix) and Full Frontal With Samantha Bee (TBS) and it made a further investment in nonfiction buying a significant stake in 2020 in Alex Gibney’s Jigsaw Productions the banner behind titles like Theranos doc The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley (HBO). In 2021 Imagine struck a multi-year first-look deal with Apple to develop a slate of scripted feature films. Other recent deals have included a bet on podcasting with a division Imagine Audio that inked an exclusive slate deal with iHeartMedia to launch six new series. — Erik Hayden.

Lionsgate’s ‘John Wick’ has turned into a multiplatform franchise. Courtesy of Lionsgate

Will a new wave of M&A in 2023 engulf Lionsgate? The studio has long coyly played buyer and seller most recently as it considers a spin-off of Starz or an outright studio sale. But after purchasing a 20 percent stake in the Spyglass Media Group and around 200 film titles Lionsgate is starting to look a lot like MGM as investors eye its giant library of franchises like John Wick Hunger Games and Saw for a Big Tech player doing its own pivot to streaming and hungry for content. Not that Lionsgate minds having a takeover target on its back. “We’re obviously one of the last remaining very large independent companies and there’s great scarcity value out there” Lionsgate vice-chairman Michael Burns told an investors conference in Sept. 2021. During an earlier consolidation wave in 2017 Hasbro eyed the Vancouver- and Santa Monica-based studio as prey before acquiring Entertainment One a company it’s now selling. While giving no timing on a Starz or studio transaction as part of strategic alternative Lionsgate is hoping growth for Starz’ streaming offering especially internationally TV series placed across all major networks and many more in development and a movie slate that includes a Hunger Games prequel and the John Wick-spinoff Ballerina will grease the wheels for possible M&A. Of course complicating Lionsgate’s dealmaking playbook is whether its studio assets or Starz is ultimately spun-off the studio wants to retain control as it looks to increase the value of its stock price and minimize its tax obligations. — Etan Vlessing

Paramount

Paramount’s ‘Top Gun: Maverick’ Courtesy of Paramount Pictures

Paramount Global smaller than its streaming rivals under CEO Bob Bakish has long been considered a takeover target for bigger fish a prospect only strengthened by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway building its stake in the Hollywood studio in recent months. With top-flight steaming platforms like Paramount+ and Pluto TV and a market cap at $11.2 billion and a stock price in the $17 range Paramount is seen as a ripe target for bigger streaming rivals like Apple Comcast or Warner Bros. Discovery or Big Tech players looking to enter the film TV and digital media space. Controlled via its class A shares by National Amusements the holding company run by Shari Redstone the Top Gun: Maverick studio just isn’t seen as having the scale — it had 67 million global streaming subscribers as of its last earnings tally — to prevail in streaming wars against Netflix and Disney+ just as digital viewing options and content costs rise sharply into 2023. And while Paramount formerly known as ViacomCBS has CBS that network is less of the cable TV juggernaut it once was amid cord-cutting and an advertising slowdown. Hence Paramount doubling down on streaming. — Etan Vlessing

Shane Smith and Nancy Dubuc Craig Barritt/Getty Images

The brash and youth-centric company that once had ambitions of replacing legacy news giants is now settling into middle age and looking for new financing. After a period of rapid growth in the 2010s — the company went from a $1.4 billion valuation in 2013 when 21st Century Fox paid $70 million for a 5 percent stake to $5.7 billion four years later when private equity firm TPG led a funding round of $450 million — Vice Media has gone through rounds of cost-cutting and layoffs. Vice’s biggest swing may have been plans for a major linear TV undertaking with Viceland a cable news brand that took the place of A+E Networks’ channel H2 and aimed at distribution in 70 million homes. But Viceland contrary to the vision of replacing cable news stalwarts like CNN or MTV never fully took hold as a linear TV channel. Founder Shane Smith stepped away from the CEO role in 2018 with A+E Networks’ Nancy Dubuc taking over the top job. In one of Dubuc’s first major moves Vice Media acquired digital media lifestyle publisher Refinery29 in 2019 in a bid to scale up the company’s online readership. After exploring IPO plans via a special purpose acquisition company or SPAC during a frenzy of dealmaking Vice eventually scuttled that effort. In September 2021 Vice announced that it raised $135 million from a round of investors including James Murdoch’s Lupa Systems TPG and TCV as well as Sixth Street and Antenna Group. Now the question may be: Will the company look to merge with another digital media company try to sell itself to a legacy operator in full or look for more private equity financing to go it alone? — Erik Hayden

It was also noted that $1 of every calendar sold supports the Kelly Jo Dowd Breast Cancer Research Fund as part of the ""Give a Hoot"" fundraising efforts. Dowd an original Hooters girl succumbed to breast cancer in 2007. The calendar has raised over $1 million.

And how did Burchett get in calendar-ready shape while being surrounded by the sights and smells of wings all day? She said it’s surprisingly simple.

""I’m a big StairMaster girl"" she chuckled. ""We move a lot at work but the StairMaster has been my go-to workout routine for the last five years. I just get on there and put my headphones on. It’s mindless but it gives you a great workout. You don’t realize how much you’ve worked out in it until you're done. If you want to change your routine you can’t go wrong with it. It’s also better for your joints. And I find it easier for me than running.""

The West Virginia University graduate has also kept busy in other ways. She participated in a fundraiser for Valarie’s House in Fort Myers Florida. The nonprofit organization provides grief support to children and families mourning the loss of a loved one.

""[Hooters] is always presenting us with opportunities to give back both locally and internationally"" she explained. ""Last year we did a raffle to support Valarie’s House. And then during our trip to the Bahamas for the photo shoot this year we brought supplies like coloring books school supplies and feminine hygiene products for Gateway Christian Academy in Bimini. That was special because I want to give back to the community as much as I can.""

""We also have a coworker one of our kitchen guys"" she continued. ""He lived right behind the Fort Myers Beach location. His house was washed away. He was staying with his father in Naples. He also has two children… the company has done so much to make sure that this man and his family are well taken care of. We have plans to adopt the family for Christmas making sure they get a tree and that they have access to a nice big Christmas dinner. We also want to make sure his kids get gifts. In light of such a terrible event as Hurricane Ian good stuff comes out of it. I’m just thankful that we could give him and his family support. To lose your job is one thing but to lose your house is something else. And yet he's been so resilient.""

Hooters was first opened by six businessmen with no restaurant experience. Their goal was to launch an establishment that had hot wings cold beer and big screen TV. More than 420 restaurants can be found today in 42 states and 29 countries. The waitresses can still be seen in the company’s trademark orange shorts.

The West Virginia native said she is aware there are still misconceptions that exist about her job. Burchett shared she is hoping to change that narrative.

""I would say that coming up on our 40th anniversary in 2023 the company has worked so hard to create a more family-friendly environment"" she said. ""There are always going to be people who are critical and maybe haven’t seen that family-friendly environment at locations they’ve been to. But I’m proud of where I work which makes that a priority. There will always be people that give you a hard time… I truly feel we have a good support system.""

""We also have great relationships with our regulars"" she continued. ""We’ve made great connections over the years. Some of these people have become lifelong friends. They’re genuinely good people. And being in Florida it’s beautiful all year round… We have a good work ethic here. I know there are stereotypes about the girls that work here. But we are all working on our degrees. We’ve got girls in nursing school girls going to law school girls who are working seven days a week to provide for their families and girls who are simply saving for the future. I have a business degree and I want to work my way up to a corporate role. My experience is that these girls are hard workers with big dreams. And they’re changing that negative connection that can sometimes be associated with Hooters.""

Most recently Burchett participated in a calendar tour where $10500 was presented to the Children's Advocacy Center of Collier County Florida along with books and stuffed animals.

""I wear my uniform with pride and that’s always been my experience"" she said."

I didn't pay much attention to it until recently but now that I have tried following the suggestions for over a month I can't say I regretted checking out this feature. It helped me get better at running and gave me a fresh perspective on effective training and recovery.

You can read more about the feature here: How do Garmin's Daily Workout Suggestions work? The feature was introduced in the Garmin Forerunner 745 and it's available in all the best Garmin watches including the Garmin Fenix 7X Garmin Enduro 2 Garmin Forerunner 955 Solar and more. You can get some of the same effects but without Garmin's algorithmic smarts with an app like Nike Run Club. A quick extract of my achievements with the full story below:

Down 2kg in bodyweight (approx. 4.4 lbs although I ate a bit better over that time)

Around 20 seconds taken off Park Run PB

Slowing down a bit suddenly made running 10km effortless - great for confidence.

Being told to run the day after a 3 am Gatwick start and 12 hours of drinking in Munich

Losing 1 point of VO2 Max on the same session that I beat the Parkrun PB (?)

Garmin Workouts seems to take things steadily working on gradual improvement

Down in the ruts

Running has stacks of benefits. It’s a competitive sport if you want. It brings structure to your day burns calories and has numerous mental health benefits. And maybe lets you see a bunch of dogs down at the local park. I’ve leaned heavily on all these running facets bar the competitive stuff over the last couple of years. However parts of this seemed to stop working in late 2022.

Do you know that aimless feeling of being in a rut? A couple of personal issues and the 4:30 pm sunsets had laid that feeling on pretty thick — that and more or less actually being in a rut — a few months ago. However running is still cheaper than a therapist so I tried a way to level up my running alongside a few other lifestyle changes to improve matters.

Free will is out the window

The plan was to throw my free will out of the window to reduce the chance of not going for a run. I would use my Garmin watch to tell me what to do each day run-wise. No excuses or backing out unless there was a legit reason to do so. All of Garmin’s higher-end watches have a feature called Suggested Workouts which offers a lightly structured session based on how ready it thinks you are for exertion. Despite having reviewed what feels like a dozen Garmin watches this year up until this point I completely ignored this feature.

Here’s how it works. When you go to start a tracked run on your watch your Garmin throws up a screen suggesting a time and pace. It could be a simple everyday run a set of intervals where you run fast for a few minutes a bunch of times interspersed with slow sections. Or you could be thrown a VO2 Max test designed to leave you more-or-less begging for the session to end.

In watches with Morning Report you’ll get a preview of what’s to come when you wake up. Morning Report is a series of screens that shows how you slept what the weather’s like and so on. My initial plan was to carry this on for a month. At the least I’d learn a bit more about how Garmin’s watches work. But I’m now six weeks into this experiment and it has completely changed how I think about running.

Running slow

The most obvious change the Garmin training programme made was to bring my pace way down for the average workout. Over the past few years I have mostly run roughly every other day generally at a “threshold” pace. You can think of this as the speed that leads to a high heart rate but one you can maintain for a reasonably long time. For everyday casual runs Garmin lowered my pace from around 5:05 per km to 5:55. I’d told myself the faster pace was my comfort zone. And sure I wouldn’t be left “feeling it” in my legs after a run the next day.

However I was fooling myself as slowing down suddenly made 10k runs feel like a doddle. In my old run style I’d rarely run the entire 5-7km of my average run without walking a bit — constantly reviewing phone cameras is a good excuse for slowing down to capture photos — but at Garmin’s pace the issue was more one of not speeding up too much. Going slower makes running easier: it seems ridiculous to say this but in practice going with Garmin’s recommendations was revelatory. Suggested workouts seem to work roughly on an 80:20 principle where only 20% of your exercise is particularly intense.

Gotta go... slow (Image credit: ASICS)

Getting overconfident

Within a week I was carrying on significantly longer after the workout had officially ended and envisioned beating my personal best Park Run (which is a 5k distance) time on the coming Saturday.

That didn't happen; I was already technically breaking my rules. As it turns out running slower for longer takes a bit of getting used to. Halfway through the first 5km Park Run after starting this program my quads were screaming and I ended up with a slower time than before I started this exercise. It's a reminder that a properly structured workout plan actually has some thought behind it.

And if you do what I did you're not going to see the best from Garmin's Suggested Workouts anyway. The system is smart enough that if you overdo a workout and run too fast or too long it will re-calibrate future workouts to compensate.

At one point I got into the habit of checking what was coming up next through the week to get in the right mental zone for any upcoming interval or VO2 Max session. However the interval workout pencilled ended up being replaced by a slow base run because I'd overdone it a bit yet again. This can get annoying but it makes sense. Garmin doesn't want to be blamed for causing injuries or bumping you into overtraining.

Slow and steady

However that doesn’t mean there aren’t some strange things to Garmin’s virtual coach. At one point I travelled to Munich for a birthday weekend spent in German beer halls. Flight times meant a 3 am start followed by more-or-less all-day drinking until past midnight.

The following day Garmin’s energy-rating Body Battery feature had me at 5 points out of a hundred. Its message was “go back to bed” but Suggested Workouts still had me go out for a 30-minute recovery run. Garmin Connect also suggests my exercise routine is highly imbalanced with an anaerobic shortage and a massive overrepresentation of “high” and “low” aerobic activity.

However it’s perhaps a reminder that some strength training — or other types of workouts — complements regular running. You’re just not going to get that with the exercise tunnel vision involved in this experiment. There is a sense of progress however. Suggested Workouts is gradually increasing the “acute load” of the routine the combined required effort if you like which plays out in the sessions becoming slightly longer.

""Running helps but isn’t a solution in itself."" (Image credit: Garmin)

What progress?

The progress I’ve seen or at least felt hasn’t had that much to do with how Garmin’s numbers are gradually ticking upwards. Eventually I did manage to beat my Park Run personal best by around 20 seconds. Over the first month I lost about 2kg in weight although another part of this whole motivation drive was an effort to do more batch cooking( and less pizza eating).

And to cap off six weeks with Garmin’s Suggested Workouts I got a bit bold with my final sessions before writing this piece up. My Garmin Enduro 2 suggested a long run the first time it has given me a workout session longer than an hour.

Despite -2 degree centigrade weather I was feeling good after the hour and five minutes Garmin suggested so I kept going to see how far I could comfortably go. And by the time I hit 15km the half-marathon distance was too tempting not to go for.

I eventually called it a day at 23km and even then the only discomfort was thigh rubbing — admittedly pretty uncomfortable stuff. Before this experiment I had never run anything longer than 10km at a time and had only tried that a handful of times over the last couple of years. As it turns out a little structure and thought can make a big difference to an exercise routine.

Has it got me out of the rut I mentioned at the start of this article? Not really. Running helps but isn’t a solution in itself. However there’s a real sense of empowerment in finding a little shift in perspective that can make you realise you can do things you never thought you could.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvbWFuYW5kaG9tZS5jb20vaGVhbHRoLXdlbGxiZWluZy9nYXJtaW4tdnMtZml0Yml0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garmin vs Fitbit - which fitness tracker is best?,"If you're in the market for a new fitness tracker you may be weighing up Garmin vs Fitbit. As two of the biggest brands around both have a range of devices suited to different lifestyles and health goals.

As woman&home's digital health editor I've tried my fair share of fitness trackers testing each one against certain criteria to establish how it works who it would work best for and the pros and cons of each. Fitbit and Garmin devices are among some of my favorites with so much choice between the two it can be difficult to find exactly the right one for you - or even decide between the brands themselves.

To help you pick in the big Garmin vs Fitbit debate I've weighed up each brand's devices against these important criteria. So whether you opt for one of the best Fitbits or the Garmin model designed perfectly for you no matter your budget you'll be able to choose the fitness tracker for your lifestyle.

Garmin vs Fitbit

1. New models

Where new models are concerned Garmin has a great variety available with running hiking and skiing-specific trackers and smartwatches aplenty while the newest Fitbit selection is a lot more refined with just three new models released this year.

The Fitbit Versa 4 is one of them a sleek and stylish tracker with all the benefits of the previous model - plus the side button is back. The Sense 2 is a great one for those who want to focus on all elements of their health and the Inspire 3 is an upgrade in substance from its previous model but lacks the same impressive battery life.

Garmin has released many new models this year which is unsurprising given the vast selection of ranges sold by the brand for different activities. You have the Forerunner 955 for enthusiasts on more of a budget at one end of the spectrum and on the other end there’s the Epix 2 and Fenix 7 Sapphire Solar. Also released relatively recently was the Garmin Instinct range a perfect pick for outdoor adventurers with unique battery-saving modes. There's also the Garmin Venu Sq 2 which has a slightly shorter battery life but more smartwatch-like features. The Garmin Vivoactive 4 also a new release is one of the brand’s more affordable options and one of the top picks for those new to fitness trackers in my opinion.

2. Features

It's difficult to break down all of Garmin’s incredible fitness features in one hit but I'll give it a go. I tried and tested the newest Garmin Venu Sq 2 for two weeks and still couldn’t get to the bottom of all the brilliant features on offer. Garmin’s devices all differ depending on which model you buy and as expected the more advanced devices offer more advanced features. However all the most basic fitness tracking is available across all models.

Firstly you can track your fitness sessions and general wellbeing 24/7 on Garmin. This means you'll have a total rundown of your heart rate step count calorie burn and workout statistics - including an interesting in-app feature where you can see which muscles you’ve targeted during a strength training session - whenever you need it. Sleep monitoring is also included although I’d argue that Fitbit Premium offers more insights into this as is stress monitoring guided on-wrist workouts breathing exercises women’s health tracking and a specialist fatigue-monitoring feature called ‘Body Battery’.

While Fitbit’s range tends to offer more choice in workouts - for example the Fitbit Versa 4 offers over 40+ workout modes to choose from while basic Garmin models offer around 20 to 25 as standard Garmin does cover all the basics - including running weightlifting swimming and cycling. Although it doesn’t automatically differentiate between spinning and outdoor cycling - this has to be added within the app. If you’re investing more and looking for a specialized watch like the Forerunner 955 then you can track more specific activities. These include favorites like hiking rock climbing and even water sports like surfing.

3. Cost

The most expensive Fitbit comes in at $299/£269 and it's the Fitbit Sense 2. The most expensive Garmin watch is the Marq Expedition a specialist hiking watch and it comes in at an eye-watering $1500 but even the so-called ‘mid-range’ watches sit around the $499 / £479 mark.

If you’re looking for the best Garmin watch at a relatively affordable price you could spend around $299 / £279 on the Garmin Forerunner 245 a specialist running watch. However this is almost as expensive as the most expensive Fitbit but with Garmin you’re essentially paying for a specialty product. The watches are more specialist designed with specific activities in mind such as running or hiking with on-screen maps daily suggested workouts and suggested recovery times so in buying one of these you are committing to an activity. Although all Garmins have multiple workout modes they can track other activities too. Fitbit devices sit at a lower price range for many reasons but mostly they are significantly more generalized to help people improve their overall fitness and health.

4. Design

Many types of Fitbit look almost the same aesthetically although there's a difference between trackers like the Fitbit Charge 5 and smartwatches like the Versa collection. But for example it's very difficult to tell the difference between a Fitbit Versa 4 and the new Fitbit Sense unless you know the model's unique colorways. This reliability works for some people like myself who enjoy the square-shaped screen and sleek design and want that over and over again with every new device.

However if you're looking for a little variation to this design - which the Apple watches also notably have - then a Garmin could be for you. Most devices (apart from the Venu collection) have a thick round clock face more similar to a traditional watch.

Both types of devices are suitable for taking with you in the shower or pool but neither brand offers completely waterproof watches. The Vivoactive Forerunner Venu Instinct and Fenix collection watches from Garmin and most Fitbits are water-resistant up to 50m.

5. Battery life

In many cases Garmin wins out on battery life boasting up to 11 days. Whether you opt for something on the cheaper end of the spectrum like the Vivofit fitness tracker or more expensive such as the Forerunner 945 they all have at least a week’s worth of battery life on a single charge. Importantly the brand also considers the battery usage of GPS or heart monitoring with the outdoor-based devices offering a unique battery-saving mode that increases its life per charge while decreasing how often it records GPS and other data. You can also enable a power-saving mode that switches off battery-draining features you don’t use as much in favor of powering the ones you do.

Fitbit isn’t too far behind though and we may even see the brand catch up in the next couple of years as the Fitbit Inspire 2 can last up to 10 days without a charge in some cases. For now though most of the smartwatches and fitness trackers last around the 6-day mark which is still more than enough in my experience to capture all the health and fitness tracking data you’ll need.

Where Garmin fails and Fitbit succeeds in battery life is the ‘quick-charging’ option that comes with the Fitbit Versa 3. While Garmin’s watches often come with a 60 to 90-minute charging time you can fuel this particular iteration of the Fitbit range to full power in just 12 minutes. Trust me I’ve done it myself.

Both brands have watches that offer an ‘always-on’ mode so you can use your fitness tracker like a regular watch with the clock face always available. However this will drain the battery life significantly faster in both cases than just flicking your wrist to bring the device to life.

Is Garmin or Fitbit better?

Garmin indeed has lots more features than Fitbit if you’re looking to hone in on one particular sport improve your recovery time and cover the basics - like step count heart rate and calorie burn. However there’s something to be said for simplicity and ease of use so even if you want all those features you can still find the perfect Fitbit for you.

If you’re a runner you’ll undoubtedly be better off with a Garmin. The Forerunner collection is one of the best around offering multiple styles to suit everyone from those who are doing their first 5k to marathon runners. The same goes for hiking enthusiasts with the Instinct collection skiers with the Fenix and golfers with the Approach.

However these specialty watches come with a price tag as noted so it's worth exploring other options too - like weighing up Fitbit or Apple Watch. If you’re looking to improve your overall health and fitness a Fitbit device could be a perfectly good one for you. With over 40 different workout modes to choose from on some newer devices on-wrist GPS and plenty of wellness-tracking workout and meditation features available in the Premium app there’s really nothing you can’t do.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvdGhpcy15ZWFycy1nYXJtaW4tcnVubmluZy13YXRjaC1yZWxlYXNlcy1yYW5rZWTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This year's Garmin running watch releases ranked,"It’d be fair to say that Garmin had a great year. The outdoor sports and GPS experts have launched new iterations of its cycling computers fitness trackers exercise bikes and loads more. However it’s the best Garmin watch releases of this year that we’re primarily interested in.

The best part is that each of them is well worth a look with the range running across all price points and feature sets to offer something for everyone all without compromising on quality.

We’ve put together our list below which ranks the top Garmin Watch releases in 2022 not including separate tactical music and solar editions. While our top watch is the Garmin Forerunner 955 and one we prefer over its siblings there’s something for everyone in this list whether you’re a casual runner or cyclist or you’re smashing marathons out of the park. Here are the top Garmin watches of 2022.

1. Garmin Forerunner 955

(Image credit: Matt Evans)

The Garmin Forerunner 955 gets the top spot for us because it’s just a very good all-rounder – although you’d expect that at this price. It takes everything you’d expect from a top-quality fitness tracker like a new Training Readiness score to add to Garmin’s existing Body battery functionality and 20-day battery life but adds in a series of smartwatch-adjacent features too.

That means it has onboard storage for your favorite playlists while its GPS is more accurate than many comparable devices we’ve tested. If you’re a keen runner it adds a whole host of complex data to sift through and while that may be overkill for many it’s also packing an impressive full-color map on your wrist to help you get home safely too. A morning report provides information about the weather your sleep and training readiness along with suggested workout intensities so you know how hard to hit the road. Truly a near-perfect running companion.

2. Garmin Venu Sq 2

(Image credit: Garmin)

Clocking in at around half the price of the Garmin Forerunner 955 the Venu Sq 2 is much more appropriate for more casual runners. If we had a “most improved” award we’d give it to the Venu Sq 2 on this list.

That’s because there isn’t an aspect that hasn’t been advanced from its predecessor the original Garmin Venu Sq – it has an AMOLED screen now which is much easier to read. It has an overhauled user interface that adds improved widgets. It’s even got double the battery life of its older brother with up to 11 hours of use on a single charge.

It doesn’t quite offer the sheer depth of data as the aforementioned Forerunner 955 but it’s still a very solid option for more budget-conscious fitness enthusiasts that may want to get to grips with basic training.

Garmin Instinct 2

(Image credit: Future)

A rugged watch for under $250 / £259 / AU$549 is a surefire way to get into the hearts of many and that’s exactly what the Garmin Instinct 2 offers. It’s not going to win a lot of awards for its design because it’s still fairly chunky (although not as big as its predecessor) but with two sizes now (45mm or 40mm) it’s a much more solid choice for those who have smaller wrists.

For that impressive price it offers excellent tracking across multiple activities be that running cycling swimming or plenty more and again operates in the gray area between smartwatch and fitness tracker even offering its own app store in the form of Garmin Connect IQ.

Honestly the Instinct 2 would be very close to the top of this list if it wasn’t still packing a monochrome (black and white) display but with near limitless battery life on the solar battery model and with impressive training advice on when to rest and when to push yourself harder it’s a great rugged outdoor companion.

4. Garmin Instinct Crossover

(Image credit: Matt Evans)

The newest tracker on this list takes much of what we love about the Instinct 2 and mixes it up with some small but noticeable tweaks.

Much of the chassis is the same as the Instinct 2 so don’t expect a drastically better-looking watch but at least the ruggedness remains intact. The change here is the addition of analog watch hands and all of the small composite UI elements behind the hands have been brought into the same design which makes it feel a little more compact without losing the ease of reading. In fact the small second display has been removed entirely and it looks cleaner in our opinion.

If you want a more modern-looking Instinct 2 it’s well worth a look and if you’re looking for analog watch hands it’s an easy pickup.

5. Garmin Enduro 2

(Image credit: Matt Evans)

The biggest most expensive Garmin Watch released in 2022 will be top of the tree for a very specific group of users and for good reason – it’s the best of everything Garmin does wrapped in a heavy big smartwatch.

That comes at a cost naturally but if you’re out for the best of the best the Garmin Enduro 2 is just that. It’s a good-looking smartwatch that can take some punishment has 32GB of onboard storage for music and apps and has a staggering 150-hour battery life with GPS. It also offers Garmin’s excellent topographical maps as well as route guidance to help keep you heading in the right direction – while also acting as a breadcrumb trail to help you get back. Lost after dark? There’s even a very bright flashlight.

It’s likely to be a bit large for many though and too pricey for others so it settles at the fifth spot on our list. But if you're a serious endurance athlete go ahead and bump this specialist performance tool right to the top.

6. Garmin Forerunner 255

(Image credit: Future)

Our final model is the Garmin Forerunner 255 which comes in lower thanks to its price being somewhere between the Forerunner 955 and the Venu Sq 2 making it a bit of a halfway house.

While it lacks the Training Readiness score found on the 955 (and many others on this list) it’s a great mid-price running watch that’s chock full of clever tech and offers a color screen. It features a range of workout modes but feels ideal for a running watch thanks to its slim design excellent GPS tracking and the fact it’s comfortable enough to be worn 24 hours a day. In fact on standby it offers a week of battery life.

Music fans can even opt for the Forerunner 255S Music variant which adds additional storage for your favorite workout tracks.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vYWZtLmFlcm8vaXJpc2gtdW5pdmVyc2l0eS13ZWxjb21lcy1lbGl0ZS1mbGlnaHQtc2ltdWxhdGlvbi1zb2x1dGlvbnMtZ2FybWluLWcxMDAwLWZsaWdodC1zaW11bGF0b3Iv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Irish University Welcomes ELITE Flight Simulation Solutions Garmin G1000 Flight Simulator,"You may also check our Terms and Conditions for our Content Policy.

Following is the latest in our series of the Best of 2022.

There are so many cybersecurity companies in the IPO pipeline that it took two weeks to cover them all. If you missed Part 1 of the IPO pipeline analysis you can catch up on it here:

Cybersecurity’s 2022 IPO Pipeline (Part 1) The first of a two part series projecting the industry’s most likely IPO candidates for the upcoming year. Strategy of Security Cole Grolmus

And the list just keeps growing. Last week 1Password announced a new $620 million round of funding that values the company at $6.8 billion. Their valuation puts them squarely into the IPO pipeline based on comparable valuations for other companies in the pipeline and ones who have recently gone public.

I chose not to include 1Password in this week’s analysis because they’ve taken such a unique path to reach the point they’re at now. The company has grown steadily over the course of 17 years (!!!). Most of those years were bootstrapped until a recent burst of huge funding rounds. Their story is so unique that I’m planning to do a full article and cover them in much more detail.

This article covers the remaining six of twelve total companies who have the potential to go public this year.

What does the company do?

Netskope has built a comprehensive Zero Trust platform that has become the leader in Secure Access Service Edge (SASE). The platform includes multiple products within cloud security including a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) Secure Web Gateway (SWG) and more.

SASE (“sassy”) is a new cloud-centric networking model coined by Gartner in 2019. Netskope is perhaps the largest and most well known company to focus on the space.

The company was first known for its Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) product and has since expanded into other areas of Zero Trust. Analyst reports for this space are a moving target. Netskope has been a consistent Leader in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for CASB and has ranked consistently high in adjacent domains.

Where do they fit into the cybersecurity ecosystem?

Netskope generally fits into the Cloud Security domain with products spanning multiple areas of Zero Trust.

How much money have they raised?

The company has raised $1 billion over 12 funding rounds according to Crunchbase. The most recent round was $300 million in July 2021.

What is their most recent valuation?

Netskope was valued at $7.5 billion as of their latest round of funding.

Have they stated an intention to go public?

No public statements about an IPO have been made but journalists have speculated the most recent round of funding was its last as a private company.

What is the bull case for an IPO?

Similar to Appgate and Illumio Netskope should ride the popularity of Zero Trust to an IPO.

Netskope may have even more of a bull case because they essentially own the CASB market. Their products are relatively diversified compared to other companies focused on Zero Trust. They were also around long before SASE gained popularity.

A $7.5 billion valuation is also much higher than many cybersecurity companies who have already gone public. This likely means Netskope is in a good place in terms of revenue and growth which should set up well for an IPO.

What is the bear case for an IPO?

There’s not much of a bear case here. Even if Zero Trust and SASE did miraculously end up being fads Netskope’s products are still useful.

A downside is that the CASB market is relatively small — estimated at $8.74 billion back in 2020. However this can be overcome by continuing to diversify into adjacent markets and giving the CASB market time to grow.

What is the most likely outcome?

Netskope is likely to IPO in 2022.

What does the company do?

Pindrop provides voice-driven authentication fraud detection behavioral analytics and more. The product was actually built from the Ph.D. thesis of co-founder Vijay Balasubramaniyan. Seriously here it is.

Voice security is a relatively unique and undefined market which is part of what makes Pindrop’s platform special. However there aren’t many analyst ratings to go by.

Where do they fit into the cybersecurity ecosystem?

Pindrop fits roughly into Biometrics and Fraud and Transaction Security. It’s a unique product though so this mapping isn’t as clean of a fit as other companies.

How much money have they raised?

The company has raised $219.6 million over six rounds according to Crunchbase. Their most recent round of funding was a $90 million Series D in 2018.

What is their most recent valuation?

According to Bloomberg Pindrop was valued at $925 million as of their funding round in 2018.

Have they stated an intention to go public?

Co-founder Vijay Balasubramaniyan discussed an IPO as the end goal with no specific timeline. From CNBC:

“If the world is moving to voice and we’re providing all of security and identity for voice I think we’ll be a very valuable public company so absolutely that’s where we’re headed.”

What is the bull case for an IPO?

Pindrop is the clear leader in the market for voice authentication fraud and security. They acquired their top competitor in 2021. Owning a market with no close competitors and holding a significant intellectual property advantage sure sounds like a nice case for an IPO.

From a strategy perspective their product has more upside than a typical security product because it’s customer-facing. Authenticating yourself on a customer service call with your mom’s maiden name and the last four digits of your SSN is something none of us enjoy doing. I’ll take voice authentication thanks.

Pindrop also prevents fraud which is a big problem for many enterprise businesses with large customer service operations. According to the CNBC interview with Vijay Balasubramaniyan the product caught $350 million worth of fraud attempts in 2018. Delivering that kind of quantifiable value is a big deal.

What is the bear case for an IPO?

Contact center platforms like Talkdesk are growing quickly (Talkdesk is currently valued at $10 billion). These platforms already have or will develop authentication features to include natively. The question for Pindrop is whether voice-based security is a standalone product or a feature within larger contact center platforms.

Pindrop is a case where switching costs could help fend off competition. Once their platform has been integrated into a company’s IVR system and call center workflows it’s unlikely to be removed any time soon. The product is stickier than an average product after the initial sale is made.

What is the most likely outcome?

Details and speculation are scarce so it’s hard to tell what this year will bring. I expect either an IPO or another large funding round in 2022 based on the timing of their last round of funding.

What does the company do?

QOMPLX is a cloud risk analytics platform. The platform is focused on cybersecurity. However it’s capable of handling other risk-based use cases in various industries. Broadly speaking think Palantir.

Analyst ratings are out the window here because it’s such a new and different product category. Public discussion is surprisingly limited for a company nearing an IPO.

Where do they fit into the cybersecurity ecosystem?

Their product is unique and doesn’t map cleanly into existing categories. It roughly maps to Security Analytics or Risk Ratings but the product does much more.

How much money have they raised?

QOMPLX has raised $107 million across four rounds of funding. The most recent round was a $78.6 million Series A in 2019.

What is their most recent valuation?

Their valuation is tricker than usual mainly because of a planned SPAC that was called off (more on that in a second).

The company was valued at approximately $1.4 billion in post-transaction equity value including proceeds and acquisitions from the SPAC shell company.

Have they stated an intention to go public?

QOMPLX announced a SPAC in March 2021. As SPACs do the intent was to take the merged company public that year. They even acquired two companies to round out the company’s product portfolio.

By August the SPAC merger was off. The chairman of the SPAC company stated “market conditions” as the reason the plans were scrapped.

This was a curious answer since well a bunch of other cybersecurity companies managed to go public in 2021 under the same “market conditions.” Intuitively it seems likely there were more factors in play.

What is the bull case for an IPO?

QOMPLX’s platform appears to be ahead of its time. The company has grown quickly. Analytics is a solid foundation for doing lots of interesting things and security teams need the best analytics they can get.

The company’s founders have world-class backgrounds including institutions like Oxford West Point and the Air Force Academy. QOMPLX’s vibe is Palantir-esque — a semi-mysterious company with radically different tech and tone than the rest of the industry.

What is the bear case for an IPO?

I worry their product isn’t well understood or accepted yet. People buy based on existing models and QOMPLX doesn’t seem to fit nicely into a buying category most traditional companies already have. The pessimistic case is “technology in search of a problem.”

In terms of growth Palantir was able to become a massive company because it won the public sector. QOMPLX needs to find a similar growth driver.

What is the most likely outcome?

They were already close in 2021 so I would expect another attempt in 2022. SPACs can be a slow moving game so it’s possible we could see an announcement that doesn’t have the time to fully materialize this year.

What does the company do?

Snyk is a developer security platform that performs real-time scans of source code to identify and fix security issues.

The company was recognized as a Visionary in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing. The market is relatively mature and led by companies that have been around much longer including Synopsys and Veracode. Achieving a Visionary ranking in this market is a significant accomplishment.

Where do they fit into the cybersecurity ecosystem?

Snyk’s products map to the Static and Dynamic Application Security Testing (SAST/DAST) category of the cybersecurity ecosystem.

How much money have they raised?

The company has raised $1.4B in funding over 11 rounds according to Crunchbase.

What is their most recent valuation?

Snyk was valued at $8.6 billion as of their most recent round of funding in September 2021.

Have they stated an intention to go public?

Snyk CEO Peter McKay has set an approximate IPO timeline for the next couple years. From Yahoo! Finance:

Snyk Chief Executive Officer Peter McKay said in an interview in March 2021 that the Boston-based company’s goal is to go public over the next couple years.

What is the bull case for an IPO?

Snyk is a fan favorite among developers because it’s a new and cool way to secure code without needing to deal with people doing time-consuming security reviews. Developer productivity and security are both high priorities for modern companies. Snyk is a force multiplier because it improves security with the least amount of friction possible. That’s an appealing value prop for any company.

Their competitors are much older products that aren’t innovating at the same rate Snyk does. Snyk doesn’t really have a modern publicly traded competitor to dethrone. There is no CrowdStrike or Okta of application security testing. Snyk has a huge opportunity to be that kind of company.

What is the bear case for an IPO?

Basically none. I’d like to be more skeptical but there’s no reason to be. Snyk is clearly leading the reform in the application security testing category. They’re improving their product rapidly and seem to have won the affection of developers in this category of products.

They likely have significant losses because of investing in growth but so does every cybersecurity company at IPO. The only reason for them to hold back on going public is to be better prepared and have their financial house a little more in order before opening it up to the public.

What is the most likely outcome?

I expect an IPO in 2022.

What does the company do?

Tanium is an endpoint security platform with modules covering multiple areas of the domain.

A father and son team spent five years developing the technology before going to market. It’s not just another endpoint security platform. Tanium’s approach to endpoint security and management is highly differentiated IP.

As described by a Reddit commenter when clarifying the difference between Tanium and other Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) products:

First of all Tanium is not an AV solution though it can manage the native Microsoft Windows Defender AV at scale across your enterprise from a central platform console. It’s currently doing this for the US Airforce with over 1 million endpoints under management with Tanium. You can search for the articles discussing this use of Tanium.

Second the communication technology is what differentiates Tanium and is what they have patented. Instead of the traditional hub and spoke model that you typically see in server to client connections Tanium uses a linear chain so there is no need for the server to connect to each endpoint.

Or for a much more detailed rendition check out Steven Sinofsky’s a16z investment memo from 2014.

Where do they fit into the cybersecurity ecosystem?

Tanium is an endpoint management platform that covers multiple domains in the cybersecurity ecosystem. A few of the primary ones include Asset Management Patch and System Management Vulnerability Management and Testing and more.

How much money have they raised?

Over $1 billion according to a press release in October 2020 and an additional $150 million round in January 2021.

What is their most recent valuation?

Tanium is valued at over $9 billion according to a press release in October 2020.

Have they stated an intention to go public?

Tanium’s founders haven’t officially stated a date to take the company public. However Tanium has been in the IPO pipeline for several years.

What is the bull case for an IPO?

Tanium is a unique company that has the potential to join the ranks of very hyped public cybersecurity companies (Cloudflare CrowdStrike Zscaler and Okta) once they IPO.

Tanium has a stellar list of customers including half the Fortune 100 and 8 of the top 10 U.S. financial institutions. They don’t need an IPO to reach the level of enterprise customers — Tanium has been an enterprise-grade company since the beginning.

They publicly disclosed having $430 million in revenue back in October 2020. They’ve likely eclipsed $500 million in the time since. $500 million is more revenue than many cybersecurity companies who are already public.

What is the bear case for an IPO?

Tanium doesn’t directly compete with CrowdStrike and SentinelOne but many parts of their platform are adjacent. They’re on a collision course due to the inevitable bundling of products that’s happening within the endpoint security space.

Endpoint security is already a brutally competitive market for public companies. It will get more competitive when Cybereason (likely) joins the ranks in 2022.

What is the most likely outcome?

Tanium’s decision is hard to predict since they’ve been IPO-ready for a few years. I expect 2022 will be the year Tanium finally goes public.

What does the company do?

Transmit Security is an authentication platform focused on passwordless auth for customer and workforce identity.

The product wasn’t included in Gartner’s 2021 Access Management Magic Quadrant; however it’s a competitor to cloud authentication platforms like Okta Auth0 Forgerock Ping Identity and others. They have received some analyst recognition including Gartner’s 2019 Cool Vendors in Identity and Access Management.

Where do they fit into the cybersecurity ecosystem?

Transmit Security is an Authentication product that has features across several domains within the market including Adaptive Authentication Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Biometrics.

How much money have they raised?

The company has raised $583 million across two rounds of funding according to Crunchbase. Their most recent funding was a massive $543 million Series A in June 2021. This was the largest fundraising round in Israeli cyber history.

Founders Mickey Boodaei and Rakesh Loonkar have done this before — most famously for Imperva. Successful exits put the founders in a position to self-finance the company for seven years (!) before raising outside capital.

What is their most recent valuation?

Transmit Security was valued at $2.2 billion as of their most recent round of funding.

Have they stated an intention to go public?

Co-founder Mickey Boodaei outlined the goal for an IPO in a 2021 interview:

“An IPO has always been a goal and when VC funds come in it only emphasizes it. Every fund has that expectation and while it’s not something I have a set date for it’s something that will come.”

The entire article is a great read about much more than big valuations and IPOs. Multiple Israeli founders describe the ethos for second-time founders and their desire to spend a long time building large enduring companies.

What is the bull case for an IPO?

When Transmit Security goes public it will likely join an elite group of decacorn cybersecurity companies. As third time founders Mickey Boodaei and Rakesh Loonkar look to be in it for the long run. An IPO is just one milestone on the path towards building a much larger public company.

What is the bear case for an IPO?

There are a lot of great cloud authentication companies. A lot. Like this is the golden era for authentication and we need to appreciate it.

A market shared among so many great companies inevitably means intense competition. In that sense Transmit Security is in a similar situation as Cybereason — they’re competing against some of the very top companies in cybersecurity.

Intense competition isn’t a shock to multiple time founders though. They were fully aware of the challenge as they started and grew the company so they’re ready for it.

What is the most likely outcome?

It’s possible but not probable that Transmit Security could IPO in 2022. The founders have taken their time building the company and clearly have plans to create something that lasts. Whether that means an IPO this year or not you can trust it will be the right long-term decision.

Cybersecurity is (Still) Going Public

Despite my best efforts it’s hard to predict exactly how many companies in the cybersecurity IPO pipeline will actually go public this year. Making predictions is a fun game to play but the final number ultimately doesn’t matter.

When you zoom out a bit more IPOs mean more legitimacy for cybersecurity companies. As I wrote in Cybersecurity is Going Public:

The number and size of public cybersecurity companies is a factor in the legitimization of cybersecurity as a standalone industry. The same was true of tech as a whole two decades ago. The next evolution is for segments of the tech industry to establish themselves as viable cohorts of public companies. Cybersecurity is one of those segments.

Even with current market volatility cybersecurity companies have proven to be relatively resilient. Security isn’t a problem that varies or goes away in uncertain economic times. Unless there is a major market correction we’re going to see a lot of IPOs this year.

I’ll be updating and tracking the IPOs in a running list of public cybersecurity companies. I have some updates planned that will make this more than just a list of companies. For now you can follow the current list here:

With the world population topping eight billion for the first time ""Santa is flying faster than ever; we estimate he's traveling over Mach 7 this year""—seven times the speed of sound more than a mile per second—""to hit all those datapoints around the world in one night"" says Adam Gorski aerospace engineer for Exton Pennsylvania-based Ansys Government Initiatives.

AGI a flight-simulation subsidiary of Ansys Inc. is one of two Philadelphia-area tech companies that cooperate to track Santa Claus' Christmas Eve flights in real time using data collected by NORAD the U.S.-Canadian North American Aerospace Defense Command.

NORAD collects data from transmitters in many places including a convenient Santa Claus sled beacon—""Rudolph's red nose"" Gorski added.

""Anything that fast is hypersonic—you see it long before you hear it. You need special technology to go that fast"" the kind that propels satellites into orbit but doesn't yet power commercial aircraft he added.

""Also magic reindeer. They go that fast.""

A sister company Center City-based Cesium builds the user-friendly dashboard software that makes Santa easier to track along with systems used by gamers and other participants in the emerging virtual-reality networks known as the metaverse.

Since the 1960s NORAD has tracked planes satellites and other flying objects over North America and made the data publicly available making it easier for flight planners to avoid accidents and improve air traffic safety.

There are Grinches who object. Twitter owner Elon Musk earlier this month suspended social media users including some journalists who provided similar information from public sources that tracked his and other billionaires' private jets around the world.

Musk said he had safety concerns that the data might be used by those who wish to harm him and other high-profile people; critics accused him of muzzling them and compromising his own promises to lessen restrictions on the circulation of information.

Despite Musk's cancellations NORAD and its Philly tech partners have continued to post their Santa Claus tracking data through the NoradSantaNews.com website (with links in a few languages) YouTube Pinterest LinkedIn—and also @NoradTracksSanta on Musk's Twitter network.

Ansys says the sites it services that provide Santa tracking information received more than 20 million visits last year and that traffic has risen each year.

Both Ansys' Exton unit—it was the private company Analytical Graphics Inc. before Pittsburgh-based military contractor Ansys bought for $700 million it in 2020—and Cesium were founded by engineer Paul Graziani and his colleagues who left what was then GE Aerospace in King of Prussia in 1990 to start a series of space technology businesses.

NORAD began tracking Santa in 1965 after a Colorado newspaper accidentally printed its headquarters' phone number in place of a department store's call-Santa line and NORAD volunteers began answering the resulting flood of calls. Ansys began aiding the effort 25 years ago; the business now known as Cesium signed on in 2012.

I asked Gorski about Musk's concern: Don't his company and NORAD worry all that information about Santa's location might be abused to compromise security? What if bad actors plot Santa's course and attempt to rob the sleigh or wreck the gift-giving operation?

""His only defense is reindeer antlers and the ability to move really fast"" Gorski acknowledged.

But Santa has many friends and able defenders watching out for him he concluded: ""NORAD reports that our Navy jets check on Santa tipping their wings as he goes past.""

The sophomore pass catcher is changing his number from No. 8 to No. 1. The transfer of quarterback Hudson Card allows Worthy to go back to his high school number.

Worthy had a bit of a down year compared to his breakout freshman campaign. He still finished with 678 receiving yards 10 total touchdowns and second-team All-Big 12 honors. Inconsistency at the quarterback position hindered Worthy’s big-play ability at times.

Texas is going to need a big game out of its top wideout against a potent Washington offense in the bowl game. Washington ranks in the bottom half of the country in passing defense providing an excellent chance for Worthy to end the season on a high note.

Here is the first look at Worthy rocking the No. 1 during practice.

Azad and Mitsubishi’s journey started about a decade ago with a few machines progressed to an exclusive bay in their current manufacturing unit and has now entered a new dimension with the forthcoming manufacturing facility being setup exclusively for MHI.

T. Nagayasu Chairman & Managing Director K. Tanaka Dy. CEO of Mitsubishi M Hasegawa Dy. GM Takasago Blade and combustion parts manufacturing MHI Japan Raja Ram Reddy Engineering Head MHI Japan Jayesh Ranjan IAS Principal Secretary Industries and commerce(I&C) Information Technology Govt. of Telangana Praveen P A Director Aerospace & Defence Government of Telangana KP Vivekananda MLA joined Rakesh Chopdar to announce the commencement of works on the USD 20 million plant at Tunikibollaram near Medchal Hyderabad that is scheduled to become operational by mid-2024. It will be part of Azad Engineering’s upcoming Centre for Excellence and Innovation Centre and will employ about 300 people.

Speaking on the occasion Rakesh Chopdar MD of Azad Engineering said: “The collaboration with Mitsubishi to build an exclusive facility is an outcome of our commitment and sustained effort to deepen our relationship as a preferred partner of global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). It’s a highpoint in our decade-long business association with Mitsubishi and testimony to Azad’s commitment to excellence.”

K. Tanaka Dy. CEO of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries said: “Azad Engineering machining capability is very impressive. They provide components of high quality and accuracy for our gas and steam turbines. So we are glad to strengthen our partnership with Azad”.

Raja Ram Reddy Engineering Head MHI Japan said: “our quality requirements are among the highest in the world and Azad is the only partner outside Japan for few critical components who can meet the demanding standards. So we partner with them for gas and steam Airfoils. They are wedded to a customer-centric approach and rate high on cost competitiveness making them extremely attractive partners in our supply chain. Besides Azad steadfastly sticks to delivery commitments. Even during the recent lockdown period when supply chains were disrupted globally Azad did not miss on delivery deadlines. So our trust in them is up multifold a strong base to our collaboration”.

You can also use your voice to control the Fire TV devices around your home or even create intricate automated routines. You can definitely go crazy.

Whatever it is you want to do you can probably do it but first you need to know what to say. If you own an Echo device and want to master Alexa these are all the voice commands you should know.

Newest Amazon Alexa commands

At its annual fall event this past year Amazon not only announced new hardware products but also talked up a few new additions to the already vast Alexa commands library including:

The ""Hey Disney"" command which allows you to get information and play around with some of Disney's most beloved characters Disney's Magic Band Plus to play game-show style trivia games and more.

command which allows you to get information and play around with some of Disney's Magic Band Plus to play game-show style trivia games and more. With the new premium $35 Alexa Voice Remote Pro ""Alexa find my remote"" into any Echo device you own (or the dedicated Remote Finder button in the Fire TV app) to play a sound from your remote making it easier to find when it's lost.

into any Echo device you own (or the dedicated Remote Finder button in the Fire TV app) to play a sound from your remote making it easier to find when it's lost. The third-generation Fire TV Cube ""Alexa watch ESPN on cable"" so that you don't have to manually change inputs on your TV and if you have a compatible webcam that you can connect into the Fire TV Cube you can say something like ""Alexa call dad"" to video call friends and family on your TV.

so that you don't have to manually change inputs on your TV and if you have a compatible webcam that you can connect into the Fire TV Cube you can say something like to video call friends and family on your TV. Amazon also announced the second-generation Amazon Echo Auto which drivers can use to play music make calls and even talk with an agent to request help by saying ""Hey Alexa call roadside assistance.""

If you're into shopping you can say something like ""Alexa show me the green pleated skirt"" to find specific clothing items using the Shop the Look feature which you can also use for home and beauty products.

to find specific clothing items using the Shop the Look feature which you can also use for home and beauty products. Using Amazon to make purchases from Whole Foods for curbside pickup? You can say ""Alexa check into Whole Foods"" to let the grocery store know you're there.

to let the grocery store know you're there. And if you want to turn on a light or some other smart home device you can now schedule it. For example you can say ""Hey Alexa turn off the kitchen lights in 5 minutes.""

Summoning Alexa

By default Amazon's connected speakers all have the same wake word. To cue up a request just say ""Alexa."" You can change the wake word to something else if say your own name is Alexa or you'd just prefer an alternative. You can also trigger your smart assistant with Amazon Echo or Computer. To change it in the Alexa app go to Settings then Device Settings then select the Echo device you'd like to change the wake word on (you have to change each device's settings individually).

If you have an Amazon Tap Dash Wand or the Amazon Fire TV voice remote you'll need to press a button to wake Alexa. Amazon updated the Tap with a hands-free mode that you must enable in the settings. The only wake word available to the Amazon Tap is Alexa.

There's also a feature called Follow-Up Mode that makes it easier and faster to issue multiple commands to Alexa without having to keep repeating the wake word if you enable it. When you do Alexa will continue to listen for another command after it's completed your first request. You can keep issuing more commands until you're done or you say ""Stop.""

Amazon has also built on this a multiple commands feature by allowing you to string two related commands into one. You can say something like ""Alexa play folk music at volume six"" or ""Alexa add bread milk and eggs to my shopping list.""

Your Echo device can be convenient in the kitchen the living room or anywhere for that matter. Amazon

Other places you can access Alexa

While the most obvious or natural way to use Alexa may be through an Echo speaker from Amazon it's not the only way you can call up Amazon's digital assistant.

In fact there are more and more ways to access Alexa being created all the time and you don't even need any specialized devices. Here are some of the most prominent ways to use Alexa with the devices you already have:

The Alexa app on iOS Android

The Amazon Shopping app

The Amazon Music app

Cortana on a Windows computer

You can enable the mobile apps to listen for Alexa when they're open (this will however disable your phone from listening for its native digital assistant's wake word -- i.e. ""Hey Siri"" or ""Hey Google"" won't work while you have the Alexa app open). Otherwise you can tap the Alexa icon to call up the assistant.

On an updated Windows computer you can summon Cortana and say ""Open Alexa."" After the initial connection is made saying this will cue up Amazon's assistant through Cortana.

Alexa Echo Auto allows you to connect your phone to Alexa in your car. The Echo Auto is capable of carrying out many of the same commands and features as your home device but with some restrictions (it won't unlock your doors for example).

The complete list of Alexa commands

The list of Alexa commands is expansive and grows with every new service or device it supports. Alexa isn't perfect but it's pretty great at understanding natural language so you don't always have to speak the commands exactly as you see them below. Many commands work when worded several different ways or even with words omitted.

When you consider the possible third-party commands through Skills -- essentially the apps of Amazon's Alexa -- the list goes on even further. To learn what individual skills are capable of visit the skill's page from the Amazon Alexa app or alexa.amazon.com.

Navya Nanda Ahsaas Channa lead boom,"For Millenials the generation that witnessed the growth of FMs and radio jockeys podcasts are the next natural choice. “We have heard it all from Akashvani ‘cool’ radio jockeys and now podcasts” says 29-year-old Neeta Sharma who bonds with her younger sister over new audio content. Her favourites include Respectfully Disagree a weekly culture podcast from The Swaddle.

True crime food to travel stories—a hyper-visual Gen Z is increasingly turning to audio content for knowledge perspective and pleasure. The generation that scrolls past an Instagram reel and forgets about it the next minute seems to have found a keeper in podcasts.

What is common between Navya Naveli Nanda Sejal Kumar and Ahsaas Channa? From What The Hell Nayva Shutup Sejal to Dear Teenage Me these upcoming Gen Z stars are hosting unique podcasts that offer a fresh take on life love relationships and more building a fan base that is only growing by the minute.

As per a PwC Global Entertainment and Media Outlook study India has the third-largest podcast listener base globally just behind US and China a number expected to rise to 17.61 million by 2023. It is no surprise then that a significant chunk of podcast listeners are Gen Z and millenial.

Riya Neeta’s sister loves both Navya’s show and The Swaddle’s Respectfully Disagree. She also listens to the podcast by influencer siblings Kritika and Deeksha Khurrana called What’s Up Sister? Both of us relate to the topics shared by the two siblings. We listen to it together like a weekly ritual” says Riya.

The next big thing

While Spotify and Apple Music have morphed into inclusive spaces where conversations are welcome music continues to remain a popular choice. As per the Spotify Culture Next Report 80 per cent of Gen Zs have felt “more centred and generally happier” when listening to their favourite music daily while 68 per cent of Gen Zs and 84 per cent of millennials say music is a “gateway to other cultures.” It is no surprise that 23-year-old Abhay Arora’s Spotify account has 16 thousand followers. His playlists like Me and Who When We Go Clubbing Together and Indie Saviours are quite a hit among his followers.

Arora’s popularity comes from That Music Project his personal Instagram page with nearly three lakh followers. It was a natural progression from the video-sharing app to the audio app.

On 5 November this year Spotify organised ‘Spotify IRL’ in Mumbai. This event brought together podcasters video creators and artistes to interact with each other through panel discussions quizzes and music.

“While all generations look back fondly to earlier eras the Zs are reinventing nostalgia. With the instability in the last few years nostalgia has been shown to provide a sense of comfort amid uncertainty for this generation” says Arjun Kolady Head of Ad sales at Spotify India.

Creators find it cheaper to start a podcast. From free platforms to lack of reliance on aesthetic backgrounds podcasts are a far more manageable side hustle for most.

Love teenage angst and learning

Ahsaas Channa hosts Dear Teenage Me a podcast with episodes under 10 minutes where celebrities talk to their teenage versions. “Podcasts feel more personal and when you listen to them you feel less lonely. Podcasts are almost like therapy for me” says the 23-year-old who began her career as a child actor and is now a regular face on OTT platforms.

Sometimes it is also about having ‘meaningful’ conversations that a 30-second reel cannot capture. The absence of ‘viral trends’ from audio platforms also adds an element of surprise to podcasts. Instead hosts rely on cliffhangers to create an air of mystery and focus on making their content feel more personal.

“I listen to the Modern Love podcast. It feels really intimate like these were real people talking about their dates and love stories” says Srishti Garg a student at the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) in Jodhpur. Garg is famous for her If Gen Z Did XYZ series on Instagram and having her own podcast is a goal she has set for herself.

There is also the element of learning something new. “If you give 30 minutes of your life to a podcast you might learn something from it. I wonder if we learn from a 30-sec reel on ‘a day in Delhi’ says Abhay Arora. An avalanche of visual content is driving Gen Z to seek other forms of digital interaction and podcasts fit the bill for many.

A ‘safe’ space

Podcasts have become the space to explore in detail avenues still considered ‘niche’ in India. Esports or online gaming is a fast-growing industry with 100 million people taking to it in 2020. Yet one almost inevitably relies on gamers and streamers from other countries for information interaction and even community building. Podcasts have brought a sea change though.

“I listen to Mythpat because I am an avid gamer. But India’s gaming scene even within Gen Z is pretty nascent. Mythpat helps me know more about all the new happenings in the gaming industry” says 21-year-old Noorie who prefers using only her first name. Noorie is just one among gaming content creator Mithilesh Patankar’s team whose social media followers range in millions.

Loyalty is a unique feature of podcasts one no longer guaranteed on Instagram. Despite reels that easily cross lakhs of views by the minute the numbers do not translate into actual engagement metrics. Since everything is about numbers Instagrammers say there is constant pressure to follow trends to boost posts and increase follower count. “We see ourselves in terms of numbers and we value ourselves in numbers” says Srishti Garg.

According to the MIDAS Survey of Summer 2022 a majority of podcast listeners—that is 68 per cent—listen to the whole episode while 70 per cent listen to almost all episodes they’ve downloaded.

The rapid advent of social media over the past decade has allowed FOMO (fear of missing out) to make its way into conversations. Podcasts are now considered a refuge for those who need affirmations about slowing down instead of rushing through life.

There is no doubt that podcasts are not yet at the phase where one listens to them every day but gradual and steady growth is evident. With more and more people becoming first-time consumers  podcasts are slowly reaching their ‘gold rush phase.

“There are too many ‘inspiring’ stories on social media sometimes that make you feel terrible for ‘wasting’ time by watching Netflix or even doing nothing. Listening to podcasts which are real raw and often unfiltered about everything be it life or relationships helps fight the urge to hustle constantly” says 21-year-old student Ila. Ila felt particularly left out when her friends shared content from parties and vacations while she took extra classes to make up for a month of studies missed due to illness. For Gen Zs like Ila podcasts feel like an understanding older sibling wiser Gen Z counterpart or an equally confused version of themselves—a virtual entity that feels real and does not judge.

This year saw the U.S. Navy moving down an acquisition path with more certainty than in 2021.

With the Biden administration embarking on its second budget cycle the U.S. Navy released its first long-range shipbuilding plan in several years providing more clarity to the industrial base on where the service is headed.

While the Navy still has multiple big-ticket acquisition programs on the horizon amid expected flat budgets the service’s top civilian recently said he is pushing for a realistic approach to cost and mature systems in the pursuit of the DDG(X) next-generation destroyer SSN(X) next-generation attack submarine and Next Generation Air Dominance Program (NGAD).

“We ought to test those technologies out before we fully commit to producing ships aircraft submarines in far larger numbers. So my hope in the Department of the Navy and the Marine Corps is that before we move forward with producing the next DDG(X) SSN(X) and NGAD is that we have designed maturity on these platforms. That takes tremendous discipline on our part not to rush to production … It’s going to take a lot of compromises a lot of balance to come up with the right answers” Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro told USNI news earlier this month.

“Let’s be realistic about how fast we should move forward before we’re ready to commit to a major [acquisition] program.”

Meanwhile the Navy and Marine Corps started off the Fiscal Year 2023 budget cycle on different pages when it comes to amphibious ships but ended the year on more common ground.

Surface Ships

In its FY 2023 budget submission the Navy asked to buy two Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and one Constellation-class frigate continuing its steady purchase of both large and small combatants.

Congressional authorizers and appropriators approved and allotted funds for the Navy to buy three Arleigh Burke destroyers. But lawmakers are urging the Navy to buy more Flight III destroyers. The FY 2023 National Defense Authorization Act includes language giving the Navy Secretary the ability to ink another multi-year procurement contract for as many as 15 Flight III destroyers which will provide a bridge as the Navy pursues its DDG(X) program.

DDG(X) which is in the research and development stages will be a new hull that follows the Flight III Arleigh Burkes. The Navy is leading the design efforts with the help of General Dynamics Bath Iron Works and HII’s Ingalls Shipbuilding helping the service. The Congressional Budget Office’s recent projection estimates that the DDG(X) program could cost between $3.1 and $3.4 billion per hull.

Meanwhile Fincantieri Marinette Marine in August began construction on the first Constellation-class frigate at its shipyard in Marinette Wis. The start of fabrication – nearly two and a half years after the Navy issued the detail design and construction award – took some time so the Navy and Fincantieri could mature the design of the ship Rear Adm. Casey Moton the program executive officer for unmanned and small combatants told reporters in August.

As for amphibious warships in the FY 2023 budget proposal the Navy sought to end the LPD-17 Flight II production line with LPD-32. Shortly after the president’s budget submission the Marine Corps’ annual unfunded priorities list put LPD-33 at the top. While the Marine Corps uses the amphibious warships for various missions ranging from amphibious lift to crisis response the funding to purchase the ships comes out of the Navy’s shipbuilding account.

The apparent disagreement between the Navy and Marine Corps led Congress to include provisions in the NDAA that would give the Marine Corps Commandant a direct say in amphibious ship requirements and fore structure.

“We can stop talking about what the requirement is year to year to year and talk more about what we can afford and how to use it and how to maintain it. Because the CNO wants to keep the LPD line hot also. You all know the reasons. We’re in 100 percent agreement there. What it does is stop talking about 31 or 35 or 38 – we know what the minimum is” Marine Corps commandant Gen. David Berger said early this month when asked what the legislation would enable him to do now that he couldn’t do before.

The Marine Corps is also still focused on building its Light Amphibious Warship to shuttle Marines around islands and shorelines in the Indo-Pacific. But the services appear divided on the number of LAWs needed for the missions – the Marine Corps wants as many as 35 LAWs while Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday’s 2022 navigation plan calls for 18 vessels.

Submarines

The Navy continued a steady acquisition of the Virginia-class attack boats asking for two of them in the FY 2023 budget request. Lawmakers met that request in the FY 2023 NDAA.

Meanwhile General Dynamics Electric Boat in June laid the keel for the lead boat in the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine program.

The Columbia-class boats are slated to replace the Ohio-class boomers as the sea-based leg of the nuclear triad. As a cushion the Navy is considering extending the lives of five Ohio-class nuclear ballistic missile submarines by three years so the service can meet surge requirements USNI News previously reported.

“The riskiest period for them is in the 2030s as Columbias come online and the Ohios go out” program executive officer for strategic submarines Rear Adm. Scott Pappano said in November at the annual Naval Submarine League symposium.

The research and development work for the next nuclear attack boat or SSN(X) also continues. The Navy asked for $144 million in research and development funds for the future submarine which is expected to resemble the Seawolf-class attack boats more than the Virginia-class so it’s stealthier and faster to perform blue water operations and carry more torpedoes.

The CBO estimates that SSN(X) could cost between $6.2 and $7.2 billion per hull while the Navy estimates it at $5.6 billion per hull.

Carriers

HII’s Newport News Shipbuilding which builds the Navy’s aircraft carriers had a record amount of aircraft carrier work at its shipyard this year.

At the start of the year USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) USS George Washington (CVN-73) and USS John C. Stennis (CVN-74) were all at Newport News for various maintenance availabilities. Meanwhile John F. Kennedy (CVN-79) is in the final stages of construction at Newport News and slated to deliver to the Navy in 2024.

Enterprise (CVN-80) is in the early stages of construction with HII laying the keel for the carrier in April USNI News reported at the time. Enterprise is expected to deliver to the Navy in 2028.

The Navy purchased Enterprise as part of a block buy with future USS Doris Miller (CVN-81) which is slated for a 2032 delivery to the service.

Aircraft

The Navy once again tried to end the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet production line so it could invest in modernization efforts. Service officials for the last several years have argued that the fourth-generation aircraft might not stand up to future advanced threats while Congress has pushed for the Navy to continue buying aircraft off a hot production line.

Despite not asking for any Super Hornets in the FY 2023 budget request Congressional authorizers approved funding for the Navy to buy eight Super Hornets. Authorizers also approved funding for 16 F-35C Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters three more than the Navy’s initial request and 15 F-35Bs for the U.S. Marine Corps. Appropriators also allotted funding for the Navy to buy eight Super Hornets.

Meanwhile the Navy increased the amount of research and development dollars it’s spending on the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program but kept the costs classified for the third budget cycle in a row.

“Although NGAD is a classified line investments do go up over the [Future Years Defense Program] somewhat dramatically for NGAD” Rear Adm. John Gumbleton the Navy’s deputy assistant secretary for budget said during a March budget briefing.

The idea is for the F/A-XX sixth-generation manned fighter to function as a “quarterback” for a network of manned and unmanned systems that would make up NGAD which would extend the range of the carrier air wing.

“The NGAD [family of systems] will replace the F/A-18E/F Block II aircraft as they begin to reach end of service life in the 2030s and leverage Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T) in order to provide increased lethality and survivability” according to joint testimony that Department of Navy acquisition officials submitted to Congress earlier this year. “F/A-XX is the strike fighter component of the NGAD FoS that will be the ‘Quarterback’ of the MUM-T concept directing multiple tactical platforms at the leading edge of the battlespace.”

F/A-XX would succeed the Super Hornets when they start to retire in the 2030s.

The Navy is also developing Future Vertical Lift maritime strike capability a family of systems with both manned and unmanned platforms that will replace the MH-60R and MH-60S helicopters.

Earlier this year Navy and Marine Corps officials said the respective requirements for each service’s future vertical lift capabilities were still under discussion but that the two found some common ground when it comes to fleet logistics and the Navy’s Distributed Maritime Operations concept. The initiatives for each service to develop new rotary wing capabilities are contained in the same program office though they may develop different requirements. For example the Navy’s rotary wing aircraft need to operate off of frigates and destroyers more than Marine Corps helicopters.

“[T]he requirements are the key and where we have to diverge based on requirements is still being discussed but I think going in that’s the plan with the Future Vertical Lift – a common site pictures on requirements and deviate only when we have to bring down costs of supporting and sustaining” Rear Adm. Shane Gahagan the program executive officer for tactical aircraft programs said in February.

Unmanned Systems

Navy officials this year continued to push for the need to divest legacy equipment so the service can invest in new platforms and modernize. This argument has been central to the Navy’s pursuit of unmanned platforms across all domains.

The Navy is testing autonomy capabilities with its fleet of USVs. In August the Navy christened Mariner its latest Ghost Fleet Overlord unmanned surface vehicle which will head to the service’s San Diego Calif.-based Unmanned Surface Vessel Division One in the Fiscal Year 2023.

But the fate of the Medium Unmanned Surface Vehicle remains murky. Earlier this year Gilday said he was rethinking the Navy’s plans for the MUSV after seeing U.S. 5th Fleet’s ongoing testing with smaller USVs.

Meanwhile during this summer’s biennial Rim of the Pacific exercise 2022 the Navy paired its two Ghost Fleet Overlord test ships – Nomad and Ranger – and USV Sea Hunter and USV Sea Hawk with manned warships to test out the manned-unmanned teaming concept. Sea Hunter and Hawk are medium-sized USVs.

Rear Adm. Casey Moton the program executive officer for unmanned and small combatants said the testing at RIMPAC would help inform the Navy’s plans for the MUSV.

The Navy also continued its acquisition of the MQ-4C Triton asking for three in the FY 2023 budget request which Congressional authorizers met in the NDAA.

The FY 2023 submission also marked the Navy’s first purchase of its production MQ-25A Stingray unmanned aerial refueling tanker. The service asked for four MQ-25As which Congressional authorizers also met in the defense policy bill.

The MQ-25As which will take over the tanking mission from the F/A-18Fs are slated to reach initial operational capability in 2025 and deploy aboard aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) by 2026.

Shipbuilding Outlook

For the first time in several years the Navy published a 30-year shipbuilding plan providing a long-range outlook for its acquisition plans.

In a departure from previous long-range shipbuilding plans the proposal included three alternatives for the years outside of the Pentagon’s Future Years Defense Program or five-year budget outlook.

While the first alternative included a low-end funding profile that would yield an inventory of 316 ships by FY 2052 the third alternative featured a high-end funding profile yielding 367 ships by FY 2052. The second alternative – yielding 327 ships by FY 2027 – focused on building both attack submarines and the Columbia-class boats under the direction of the Pentagon’s office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation USNI News previously reported.

While the 30-year shipbuilding blueprint provides insight on the Navy’s acquisition plans Congress will ultimately get the final say. Lawmakers have criticized the Navy for pushing to decommission more ships than it plans to build in a given year. In FY 2023 the Navy sought to decommission 24 ships. Congressional authorizers rejected the proposal and prevented the service from decommissioning 12 ships in the FY 2023 NDAA.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vd29ybGRzLWxhcmdlc3QtZGVzdG9yeWVyLXVzcy16dW13YWx0LXVzLW5hdnktc2hpcC1iaWdnZXN0LTIwMjItNtIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vd29ybGRzLWxhcmdlc3QtZGVzdG9yeWVyLXVzcy16dW13YWx0LXVzLW5hdnktc2hpcC1iaWdnZXN0LTIwMjItNj9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Inside the USS Zumwalt the world's largest destroyer,"The USS Zumwalt is the lead ship among three Zumwalt-class destroyers.

The USS Zumwalt was named after Adm. Elmo Zumwalt the youngest chief of naval operations in US history. The ship is a guided-missile destroyer which means its main purpose is to provide antiaircraft support to the US Navy's fleet.

The ship's construction began in October 2008. It was launched in October 2013 and put into commission by the US Navy in October 2016.

The Navy has two other Zumwalt-class destroyers: the USS Michael Monsoor and the USS Lyndon B.

In an interview with Runway Girl Network Şenol shares her inspiring story.

Şenol says she originally planned to become an industrial engineer. But just before she was set to start university in 1993 she received a letter from the Turkish Air Force Academy inviting her to sign on as a student on account of her high scores in high school. The letter urged: “Come fly with us!”

“At that moment I had a great feeling of excitement to fly and I accepted their offer immediately” she confides. That same year she began her training at the Turkish Air Force Academy a four-year co-educational military academy located in the city of Istanbul.

It was unusual for women to serve in combat positions or receive training for such though Şenol says she was eager for the challenge. She was one of roughly a dozen women selected to train at the academy in 1993.

After graduation she entered two years of pilot training in Izmir becoming a jet pilot in 1999. “During my first solo flight that experience taught me that I was far more capable than I ever thought I could be. I felt that I could stay in the cockpit for the rest of my life through a great feeling of excitement and freedom” she tells RGN.

In 2000 Şenol became the first female to fly the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon on behalf of Turkey. “I still remember my first solo flight on the F-16. It took 1 hour and 40 minutes. It was a great experience since I felt as if I had wings just like a bird. I remember and feel the excitement of both the plane the flight and the mission like today” she enthuses.

She flew the F-16 at Ankara and the Northrop F-5 combat aircraft at Konya. Thereafter she served in various units and squadrons in cities across Turkey including Merzifon Ankara Istanbul and Izmir.

Şenol retired from the Turkish Air Force as a Major and started flying Boeing 737 twinjets for Turkish airline SunExpress.

When asked if her transition from military to civilian flights was challenging she responds “Yes. Everything was different so it was a pretty steep learning curve for me.”

She continues: “Transitioning from a single seat fighter jet with no one else at the controls to a crew aircraft with crew management was interesting for me.

“At first I was trying to do everything on my own because I was accustomed to control everything alone as a fighter pilot. But later I was able to find ways to get the things I need to get done but all within the regulation.”

She ultimately became a Captain on the Boeing 737NG. Then the Turkish Air Force came calling again. Şenol answered the call instructing cadets at the academy for three years before retiring as a Colonel.

Now she continues to fly 737NGs as a Captain for SunExpress. As a pioneering female pilot Şenol feels responsible for serving as an example for people around the world. For this reason she also teaches students to fly in addition to her piloting career.

Source: UK MoD/Crown copyright

As with the Universe’s faster-than-light expansion the horizon for the UK’s Ajax armoured vehicle programme service entry remains always over the next hill forever chasing stages moving inexorably to the right.

In the final few days of 2022 a timeline update for the troubled programme intended to deliver 589 platforms into service with the British Army revealed that Reliability Growth Trials and analysis due to begin in January 2023 could run until Q1 2025.

The data was published in a UK parliamentary written answer on 21 December one of a series that UK Government ministers had to field on the programme before the end of the year. According to the UK’s recent Defence Equipment Plan 2022-2032 there was no “realistic timescale” for when Ajax and its variants could enter service.

This future capability is a key element to the restructure of the British Army initially into the so-called Strike Brigades and more recently into Brigade Combat Teams a term seemingly lifted from the US Army vocabulary. The first prototype Ajax vehicle was unveiled in 2015 more than seven years ago.

Statements by UK officials in October failed to provide any clarity as to when Ajax could enter service with its use “remaining limited under safety notices” while work was carried out to resolve noise and vibration issues that have plagued the development of the platform. Further it was stated that it was “not possible to say” when Ajax could enter service.

By mid-October this year a pause in testing had been lifted enabling some limited User Validation Trials to take place with the successful completion of this stage allowing the programme to move towards the Reliability Growth Trials.

In a programme analysis in the UK Ministry of Defence’s (MoD’s) Defence Equipment Plan released in December this year it was reiterated that “technical issues with noise and vibration” had resulted in delays to the Armoured Cavalry Programme under which Ajax is to be delivered. The resumption of trials in October was carried out in part to assess the effectiveness of the modifications proposed by programme prime US defence OEM General Dynamics.

Further it was expected that Ajax would be taken forward for formal approval to reset the programme following what the MoD described as “the effective resolution of the noise and vibration concerns”.

The UK MoD placed a £3.5bn ($5.56bn) order for 589 Ajax vehicles in six variants in September 2014 although the programme earlier described as a military-off-the-shelf vehicle has its origins from the late-2000s in the Scout SV programme. In March 2010 General Dynamics UK was selected as preferred bidder against the BAE Systems CV90 and later that same year MoD awarded a £500m ($780m) contract to GDUK for prototype development based on the Spanish ASCOD armoured vehicle.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kZncvbmFtZS9qZXJyeS1iYWtlci1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zODQ1MzU2N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jerry Baker Obituary (1943 - 2022) - Fort Worth TX - Star-Telegram,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/dfw/name/jerry-baker-obituary?id=38453567 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kZncvbmFtZS9qZXJyeS1iYWtlci1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zODQ1MzU2N9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The 1980s were a golden age for breakfast cereal with manufacturers jazzing up the marketing and bringing daring new ingredients to the fore. The two big movements in this sector were the opposite of one another — the '80s saw a glut of heavily-sweetened sugary cereals despite most brands trying to drop or avoid the use of the word ""sugar"" in their names (via MeTV) to avoid criticism. It was also a time when consumers were extremely interested in diet foods (according to Bon Appétit); the decade saw a boom in processed packaged foods marketing themselves as ""healthy."" Regardless the '80s were a rich era for the consumer economy and advertising alike but with the proliferation of children's television and the popularity of Saturday morning cartoons cereal became less of a food and more of a pop culture medium with TV shows toys and movies generating tie-in breakfast foods.

Many wonderful and memorable cereals were launched in the 1980s. While several were definitely products of their time a few hung around to become all-time favorites. So get yourself ready for a balanced breakfast and take a look back to the time of leg warmers aerobics and the Smurfs with this list of exemplary cereals from the '80s ranked from least to most awesome.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyL2RlYy8yNS9wZWVsLWhvdXNlLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtY2hyaXN0bWFzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Peel House celebrates Christmas,"



Peel Compton Foundation backers celebrated the holiday early at the annual Christmas at Peel Museum on Dec. 2 in Bentonville.

Javier Zavala Foundation Board member shared with those gathered a snapshot of the past year at the 32-year-old nonprofit organization.

""As many of you know the Peel Compton Foundation provides four community spaces in Bentonville: Peel Museum & Botanical Garden Compton Gardens & Arboretum Coler Mountain Bike Preserve and Osage Park. These amazing spaces encompass nearly 400 acres right here in our hometown one in which we are enjoying this evening.""

Zavala said that in the past year:

• Peel Museum welcomed 8300 guests plus more than 1100 4th graders explored Arkansas history at the annual School Days program.

• Compton Garden's annual Native Tree and Plant Sales got over 7000 native plants back into our community to support our Arkansas ecosystem.

• Coler Mountain Bike Preserve's trail counters have tracked more than 895000 trail uses this year.

• At Osage Park 550 hours have been spent on invasive plant removal and 450000 native plant seeds have been spread.

• We welcomed more than 5600 educational program participants across all four spaces which is more than double that number last year.

Also in the past year:

• We welcomed more than 400 members for archery at The Quiver Archery Range at Osage Park many trying the sport for the first time!

• We doubled the size of our pickleball courts at Osage Park to be the first park with eight dedicated courts.

• We opened The Rise the first exercise stairs in the region at Coler.

Proceeds from the event support Peel Compton Foundation's mission to ""connect the community through nature education recreation and preservation at Peel Museum & Botanical Garden Compton Gardens & Arboretum Coler Mountain Bike Preserve and Osage Park.""

Save the date for the 2023 Christmas at Peel Museum on Dec. 1.

It demonstrated his work with “mycotecture” the creation of materials from the manipulation of mycelium which is the substance comprising the root structure of mushrooms. Mr. Ross bought mushroom spores from local farmers and coaxed them to grow into a substance he describes as akin to medium-density fiberboard. Preparing for the exhibit he met Sophia Wang then a Ph.D. student at the University of California Berkeley who helped him produce the show.

Mr. Ross continued to experiment with mycelium and by 2012 after receiving requests from multiple companies interested in the technology Mr. Ross asked Ms. Wang to join him in starting MycoWorks to commercialize his mycotecture technique. They co-founded the company the following year while Ms. Wang was finishing her dissertation.

The Hon. President of Sri Lanka Ranil Wickremesinghe graced the occasion as the chief guest. The presence of the Japanese Ambassador to Sri Lanka His Excellency Mizukoshi Hideaki further made the event memorable. Senior representatives of Toyota Tsusho Corporation the holding company of Toyota Lanka were also present at the event headed by Mr.Takuro Akasaka Chief Operating Officer of the Automotive Division. On behalf of Toyota Lanka Mr.Sachio Yotsukura Chairman and Mr.Manohara Atukorala Managing Director/CEO were part of the opening ceremony.



Sachio Yotsukura Chairman of Toyota Lanka (Private) Limited shared his thoughts. “The automotive industry has entered an era of profound transformation along with the rapid global developments. In line with such developments Toyota’s new Global Vision has also enhanced to ‘lead the future mobility society enriching lives around the world with the safest and most responsible ways of moving people’. Establishment of this Fulfillment Center reflects our strong commitment and a steppingstone towards materializing such mobility society. We have introduced Toyota’s state-of-the-art logistics solutions here in Sri Lanka which enable us to provide quality-controlled products on a timely basis with accuracy and in the most efficient and cost-effective manner.”

Sri Lanka’s pre-eminent automobile provider and the exclusive distributor for Toyota vehicles material handling equipment and Hino commercial vehicles have established its stronghold during the past 25 years. The company has an Island wide network of 18 facilities to support all requirements of its customers from vehicle servicing to medium and heavy repairs.



Despite present challenges faced within the country’s mobility sector Toyota Lanka continues to invest in new infrastructure fulfilling the brands promise in creating happiness to its valued customers and all stakeholders. Toyota Lanka will continue to be a buoyant player in Sri Lanka’s mobility transition.



The newly opened Toyota Lanka fulfillment center will be the foundation for the “new world” in mobility by facilitating all logistic requirements of Toyota Lanka and its customers. The new facility will support the operations of the island wide dealer network and dealer points for all its allied products. Furthermore a significant cost saving is anticipated with the facility being in full operation whilst improving customer convenience through the improved supply chain.

Kite Pharma will acquire Philadelphia-based Tmunity Therapeutics to strengthen its cell therapy capabilities.

A Gilead Sciences company Kite announced Tmunity’s next-generation CAR-T therapies and technology will complement its own cell therapy research capabilities. Kite’s acquisition of Tmunity founded by Carl June creates a strong bridge between the BioHealth Capital Region where Kite maintains its manufacturing capabilities in Frederick and the Greater Philadelphia biohub.

Financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023.

The acquisition brings multiple clinical and preclinical programs into Kite’s pipeline. Among the assets is Tmunity’s “armored” CAR-T technology platform. Kite believes this technology can provide CAR-Ts with the capability to enhance anti-tumor activity. The company announced the platform can also improve manufacturing.

Beyond the pipeline assets Tmunity’s founders including June Bruce Levine James Riley and Anne Chew all innovators in the cell therapy field will become senior scientific advisors for Kite.

June who leads a cell and gene therapy research team at the University of Pennsylvania touted the merger and said Kite is a perfect partner for Tmunity. He said Kite has shown an ability to address challenges associated with cell therapies. June also noted Kite has demonstrated capabilities in scaling its cell therapy platform across the globe in order to bring CAR-T treatments to patients.

“Kite’s singular focus on cell therapy makes them unique and particularly nimble” June said in a brief statement.

Under terms of the acquisition Kite assumes oversight of the research and development collaboration between Tmunity and the University of Pennsylvania. Tmunity has licensed four clinical stage solid tumor CAR-T programs created at Penn. The company is also supporting further development of several more pipeline candidates through sponsored research agreements with the vaunted Gene Therapy Program (GTP) at University of Pennsylvania.

Last year Tmunity expanded its collaboration with the university. That brought additional access to certain platform and manufacturing technologies as well as a Phase I stage Mesothelin CAR T-cell therapy product that is under development for multiple solid tumors including pancreatic ovarian and lung cancer.

When the acquisition of Tmunity is complete the partnership with Penn will be extended until 2026 with an option to extend further.

For Kite the acquisition of Tmunity comes weeks after the company forged a collaboration with California-based Arcellx Inc. to co-develop that company’s lead product candidate CART-ddBCMA. The Phase II Arcellx asset is in development for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. CART-ddBCMA is an investigational autologous T cell therapy that harnesses Arcellx’s novel D-Domain binder. Kite and Arcellx will jointly advance the CART-ddBMCA asset.

Kite Chief Executive Officer Christ Shaw touted the merger with the Tmunity team.

“The Kite team is thrilled to be joining forces with the researchers at Tmunity who are rapidly advancing cell therapy research from the labs into the clinic through their unique partnership with the University of Pennsylvania” Shaw said in a statement. “Together we bring a deep understanding of cell therapy as an effective platform and combined with Kite’s industry-leading global scale we collectively have a singular focus: to use cell therapy to develop potential cures and to get them to patients as quickly as possible.”

Tmunity’s prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) assets are not part of the Kite acquisition. Those are expected to be spun out by Tmunity as part of the transaction the company noted in its announcement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirQFodHRwczovL2FzY29wb3N0LmNvbS9pc3N1ZXMvZGVjZW1iZXItMjUtMjAyMi9yaWJvY2ljbGliLXBsdXMtZW5kb2NyaW5lLXRoZXJhcHktdnMtY29tYmluYXRpb24tY2hlbW90aGVyYXB5LWZvci1wYXRpZW50cy13aXRoLWJyZWFzdC1jYW5jZXItZm9jdXMtb24tdGhvc2UtaW4tdmlzY2VyYWwtY3Jpc2lzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ribociclib Plus Endocrine Therapy vs Combination Chemotherapy for Patients With Breast Cancer: Focus on Those in ...,"According to findings from the phase II RIGHT Choice trial many premenopausal patients with metastatic hormone receptor–positive HER2-negative breast cancer experiencing visceral crisis are best treated with first-line ribociclib plus endocrine therapy rather than with chemotherapy.1

Ribociclib an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) given with endocrine therapy led to a doubling in median progression-free survival compared with combination chemotherapy and was associated with fewer adverse events according to Yen-Shen Lu MD PhD Professor and Division Chief of Medical Oncology at National Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei. Dr. Lu presented the findings at the 2022 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.



Yen-Shen Lu MD PhD

“The results of the RIGHT Choice trial reveal that front-line ribociclib plus endocrine therapy can be an efficacious clinically meaningful treatment option for patients with aggressive advanced breast cancer and helps to avoid the need for combination chemotherapy and its associated toxicities” Dr. Lu said.

As Dr. Lu noted the combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors plus endocrine therapy has been widely adopted as first-line treatment in hormone receptor–positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. However many guidelines continue to recommend chemotherapy for the subset with rapidly progressing or highly symptomatic disease. The RIGHT Choice trial challenges that recommendation.

Moderator of a press briefing Virginia Kaklamani MD SABCS Co-Director and Professor of Medicine at UT Health San Antonio said the study is the first to compare a CDK4/6 inhibitor with combination chemotherapy. “I agree that these findings will change some of the standard of care” she said. “We don’t use a lot of chemotherapy nowadays because of how well the CDK4/6 inhibitors work but I think the little that we use is probably now dead.”



Virginia Kaklamani MD



Ruth O’Regan MD

Also at the press briefing Ruth O’Regan MD Professor and Chairman of Medicine at the University of Rochester in New York commended the investigators of the study. “I think this is a question we’ve had and even though this is a phase II study it is really showing us that we don’t need to use chemotherapy for these patients.”

RIGHT Choice Details

The trial enrolled 222 pre- or perimenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive HER2-negative previously untreated aggressive breast cancer. More than half (52%) were determined to be in visceral crisis as indicated by rapidly progressing disease or impending visceral compromise symptomatic visceral metastases or markedly symptomatic nonvisceral disease. The population was 54% Asian and 46% White.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive ribociclib at 600 mg for 3 weeks on 1 week off given with letrozole or anastrozole plus goserelin or investigator’s choice of combination chemotherapy which could be docetaxel plus capecitabine paclitaxel plus gemcitabine or capecitabine plus vinorelbine. Patients were followed for a median of 24 months. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by local assessment. At the time of data cutoff 46% of patients were continuing ribociclib compared with 24% continuing combination chemotherapy.

Doubling in Progression-Free Survival

“There was a significant progression-free survival benefit of 1 additional year [with ribociclib] compared with combination chemotherapy. The benefit was consistent for most subgroups of patients” Dr. Lu reported.

Median progression-free survival was 24.0 months with ribociclib plus endocrine therapy compared with 12.3 months with combination chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.54; P = .0007). Overall response rate was 65.2% for ribociclib plus endocrine therapy compared with 60.0% for combination chemotherapy and the time to response was rapid and similar: 4.9 months and 3.2 months respectively (HR = 0.78).

“Combination chemotherapy is known to have a high response rate which is why it is sometimes preferred for this patient group. In both arms the overall response rate was similar” he said. “Ribociclib plus endocrine therapy can generate a high tumor response rate matching the data with combination chemotherapy.”

KEY POINTS In the phase II RIGHT Choice trial ribociclib plus endocrine therapy was compared with combination chemotherapy as first-line treatment of patients with advanced hormone receptor–positive HER2-negative breast cancer more than half of whom had visceral crisis.

Ribociclib plus endocrine therapy led to a doubling in median progression-free survival vs combination chemotherapy: 24.0 months vs 12.3 months (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.54; P = .0007).

Overall response rate was 65.2% for ribociclib plus endocrine therapy compared with 60.0% for combination chemotherapy and the time to response was rapid and similar: 4.9 months and 3.2 months respectively (HR = 0.78).

Ribociclib plus endocrine therapy was reported to be better tolerated than combination chemotherapy.

Tolerability

Tolerability was better with ribociclib plus endocrine therapy than with combination chemotherapy with serious treatment-related adverse events seen in 1.8% and 8.0% respectively and treatment-related discontinuations reported in 7.1% and 23.0% respectively. Although neutropenia and leukopenia were more common with ribociclib plus endocrine therapy chemotherapy-treated patients were much more likely to report nausea vomiting and diarrhea—“which impact quality of life” Dr. Lu noted.

“Younger patients with aggressive disease often show resistance to treatment resulting in worse prognoses. So it is encouraging to see RIGHT Choice data demonstrating a significant 1-year benefit for this patient population with ribociclib plus endocrine therapy” he concluded.

The Human Genome Project launched in 1988 when the U.S. National Academy of Sciences outlined the goals for one of the most ambitious projects in human history: the sequencing of the entire human genome. As part of the launch the Office for Human Genome Research was founded within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) making the NIH and Maryland the epicenter of the Human Genome Project for the next 15 years.

Remarkably the Human Genome Project mapped 90% of the genome two years ahead of schedule in 2003 marking a tremendous and invaluable scientific achievement by a team of thousands from 20 research centers and universities across the globe. The sequencing of the human genome planted the seeds that grew into two revolutionary life sciences sectors: the cell and gene therapy industries.

The legacy of the Human Genome Project can be seen all across Maryland today as the state has become a vibrant and expanding hub for leading-edge cell and gene therapy companies.

Jeff Galvin the CEO of American Gene TechnologiesⓇ one of the leading biotech companies in Maryland has championed the state as “DNA Valley.” And Galvin should know: he came to Maryland after a successful career in Silicon Valley and sees parallels between the early days of an emerging Silicon Valley and what’s going on today in DNA Valley which currently stretches from Montgomery County and Frederick Maryland all the way up to Baltimore.

“Maryland has significant unique factors that make it a particularly efficient place to grow a company in the gene and cell therapy industry – a combination of a highly trained workforce federal institutes like NIH and the FDA excellent educational institutions and lots of room for growth. The Human Genome Project happened right here and not only unlocked the secrets of our DNA but also generated a critical mass of scientists experienced in cutting edge genetics who then started or joined companies here” stated Galvin.

“What we’re seeing in Maryland today is what I saw happening in the early days of Silicon Valley where talent technology and local state and federal resources came together to create explosive growth in new high-tech industries such as computers software and the Internet. The Human Genome Project ‘lit the fuse’ on what is now DNA Valley and the momentum building in Maryland around cell and gene therapy will make the state a global leader in this space.”

Scores of companies are developing cell and gene therapies in Maryland. Kite a Gilead Company REGENXBIO NextCure Neximmune Arcellx Maxcyte and American Gene Technologies are just a few that call DNA Valley home. Galvin believes that the exciting scientific innovations emerging from DNA Valley are just the tip of the proverbial iceberg.

Gilead Sciences after acquiring Kite Pharma chose to locate Kite’s brand new 275000 square foot cell therapy manufacturing facility in Frederick Maryland.

REGENXBIO received its first FDA approval for ZOLGENSMA which was created as a one-time fix for spinal muscular atrophy in toddlers under the age of two. REGENXBIO’s platform technology that applied to spinal muscular atrophy was sold to Avexis and later Novartis for $8.7 billion.

In early 2022 Arcellx announced that it closed a successful IPO. In September of this year Maxcyte opened a brand new 67000 square foot headquarters in Rockville. NextCure is growing rapidly and advancing its pipeline of novel potentially first-in-class therapies. NexImmune recently announced a new research collaboration with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and had an IND cleared by the FDA in the summer of 2022.

Galvin’s American Gene Technologies also recently announced an update on its Phase I trial for its promising HIV Cure Program.

In addition to the bevy of emerging cell and gene therapy companies DNA Valley sits within the #4 ranked bio cluster (as per Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News) in the U.S. and is empowered by a remarkable suite of assets that support the larger Maryland Virginia and Washington D.C. biopharma ecosystem. Maryland alone has some 2700 life sciences companies and nearly 500 private research and development organizations. There is also a bio hub sprouting around the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.

DNA Valley’s assets include some of the world’s greatest research and regulatory bodies like the NIH and the FDA. Great research universities like Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland System also call DNA Valley home and continue to provide the talent and great ideas that fuel innovation. Maryland itself has one of the highest concentrations of PhDs per capita in the U.S. making it a state with a deep and rich life sciences talent pool to support growth.

The state of Maryland also offers life sciences companies including those in the cell and gene therapy space a robust slate of tax incentives including a Biotechnology Investment Incentive Tax Credit a Research and Development Tax Credit and a Job Creation Tax Credit.

Those are just a few of the reasons why cell and gene therapy companies choose to hang their shingle in Maryland.

“It takes a village to raise a company and you couldn’t get a better village than Maryland. What we’re doing at AGT™ would be difficult to do anywhere else. This is a small town and a giant town at the same time. There’s so much momentum and growth and opportunity. It’s also an incredible place for a family and life” stated Galvin in his recent Montgomery County Hall of Fame induction speech.

“We can build this community to a level that will make my old home of Silicon Valley jealous” he added.

All the life sciences assets and support elements exist in Maryland to make it a global epicenter of cell and gene therapy innovation well into a bright future. DNA Valley is flourishing and the best is yet to come.

Stay tuned.

King Dollar is facing a revolt.Tired of a too-strong and newly weaponised greenback  some of the world’s biggest economies are exploring ways to circumvent the US currency Smaller nations including at least a dozen in Asia are also experimenting with de-dollarisation . And corporates around the world are selling an unprecedented portion of their debt in local currencies wary of further dollar strength.No one is saying the greenback will be dethroned anytime soon from its reign as the principal medium of exchange. Calls for “peak dollar” have many times proven premature. But not too long ago it was almost unthinkable for countries to explore payment mechanisms that bypassed the US currency or the SWIFT network that underpins the global financial system.Now the sheer strength of the dollar its use under President Joe Biden to enforce sanctions on Russia this year and new technological innovations are together encouraging nations to start chipping away at its hegemony. Treasury officials declined to comment on these developments.“This will simply intensify the efforts in Russia and China to try to manage their part of the world economy without the dollar” said Paul Tucker a former deputy governor of the Bank of England in a Bloomberg podcast.Writing in a newsletter last week John Mauldin an investment strategist and president of Millennium Wave Advisors with more than three decades of markets experience said the Biden administration made an error in weaponising the US dollar and the global payment system.“That will force non-US investors and nations to diversify their holdings outside of the traditional safe haven of the US” said Mauldin.Plans already underway in Russia and China to promote their currencies for international payments including through the use of blockchain technologies accelerated rapidly after the invasion of Ukraine. Russia for example began seeking remuneration for energy supplies in rubles.Soon the likes of Bangladesh Kazakhstan and Laos were also stepping up negotiations with China to boost their use of the yuan. India began talking up more loudly the internationalisation of the rupee and just this month started securing a bilateral payment mechanism with the United Arab Emirates.Progress however appears to be slow. Yuan accounts haven’t gained traction in Bangladesh for example due to the nation’s wide trade deficit with China. “Bangladesh has tried to pursue de-dollarisation in trade with China but the flow is almost one-sided” said Salim Afzal Shawon  head of research at Dhaka-based BRAC EPL Stock Brokerage Ltd.A major driver of those plans was the move by the US and Europe to cut off Russia from the global financial messaging system known as SWIFT. The action described as a “financial nuclear weapon” by the French left most major Russian banks estranged from a network that facilitates tens of millions of transactions every day forcing them to lean on their own much smaller version instead.That had two implications. First the US sanctions on Russia stoked concern that the dollar could more permanently become an overt political tool — a concern shared especially by China but also beyond Beijing and Moscow. India for example has been developing its own homegrown payments system that would partly mimic SWIFT.Second the US decision to use the currency as part of a more aggressive form of economic statecraft puts extra pressure on economies in Asia to choose sides. Without any alternative payments system they’d run the risk of being compelled into compliance with or enforcement of sanctions they may not agree with — and losing out on trade with key partners.“The complicating factor in this cycle is the wave of sanctions and seizures on USD holdings” said Taimur Baig managing director and chief economist at DBS Group Research in Singapore. “Given this backdrop regional steps to reduce USD reliance are unsurprising.”Just as officials across Asia are loath to pick a winner in US-China tussles and would prefer to keep relations with both the US penalties on Russia are pushing governments to go their own way. Sometimes the action takes a political or nationalist tone — including resentment of Western pressure to adopt sanctions on Russia.Moscow looked to convince India to use an alternative system to keep transactions moving. Myanmar’s junta spokesman said the dollar was being used to “to bully smaller nations.” And Southeast Asian countries pointed to the episode as a reason to trade more in local currencies.“Sanctions make it more difficult – by design – for countries and companies to remain neutral in geopolitical confrontations” said Jonathan Wood head of global risk analysis at Control Risks. “Countries will continue to weigh economic and strategic relationships. Companies are caught more than ever in the crossfire and face ever more complex compliance obligations and other conflicting pressures.”It’s not just the sanctions helping to accelerate the de-dollarisation trend. The US currency’s rampant gains have also made Asian officials more aggressive in their attempts at diversification.The dollar has strengthened about 7% this year on track for its biggest annual advance since 2015 according to a Bloomberg index of the dollar. The gauge reached a record high in September as dollar appreciation sent everything from the British pound to the Indian rupee to historic lows.The dollar’s strength is a huge headache for Asian nations who’ve seen prices of food purchases soar debt-repayment burdens worsen and poverty deepen.Sri Lanka is a case in point defaulting on its dollar debt for the first time ever as a soaring greenback crippled the nation’s ability to pay up. Vietnamese officials at one point blamed dollar appreciation for fuel-supply struggles.Hence moves such as India’s deal with the UAE which accelerates a long-running campaign to transact more in the rupee and to set up trade settlement agreements that bypass the US currency.Meanwhile dollar-denominated bond sales by non-financial companies have dropped to a record low 37% of the global total in 2022. They’ve accounted for more than 50% of debt sold in any one year on several occasions in the past decade.While all these measures may have a limited market impact short term the end result may be an eventual weakening of demand for the dollar. The Canadian dollar and Chinese yuan’s shares of all currency trades  for instance are already slowly edging higher.Technological progress is another factor facilitating efforts at moving away from the greenback.Several economies are chipping away at dollar use as a by-product of efforts to build new payment networks — a campaign that pre-dates the surging greenback. Malaysia Indonesia Singapore and Thailand have set up systems for transactions between each another in their local currencies rather than the dollar. Taiwanese can pay with a QR code system that’s linked with Japan.All-in the efforts are driving momentum further away from a West-led system that’s been the bedrock for global finance for more than half a century. What’s emerging is a three-tier structure with the dollar still very much on top but increasing bilateral payment routes and alternative spheres such as the yuan that seek to seize on any potential US overreach.And for all the agitation and action afoot it’s unlikely the dollar’s dominant position will be challenged anytime soon. The strength and size of the US economy remains unchallenged Treasuries are still one of the safest ways to store capital and the dollar makes up the lion’s share of foreign-exchange reserves.The renminbi’s share of all foreign-exchange trades for example may have climbed to 7% but the dollar still makes up one side of 88% of such transactions.“It’s very hard to compete on the fiat front — we have the Russians doing that by forcing the use of rubles and there’s wariness with the yuan as well” said George Boubouras three-decade markets veteran and head of research at hedge fund K2 Asset Management in Melbourne. “At the end of the day investors still prefer liquid assets and in this sense nothing can replace the dollar.”Nevertheless the combination of moves away from the dollar are a challenge to what then-French Finance Minister Valéry Giscard d’Estaing famously described as the “exorbitant privilege” enjoyed by the US. The term which he coined in the 1960s describes how the greenback’s hegemony shields the US from exchange-rate risk and projects the nation’s economic might.And they may ultimately test the entire Bretton Woods model a system that established the dollar as a leader in the monetary order which was negotiated at a hotel in a sleepy New Hampshire town at the close of World War II.The latest efforts “do indicate that the global trade and settlement platform that we’ve been using for decades may be beginning to fracture” said Homin Lee Asia macro strategist at Lombard Odier in Hong Kong whose firm oversees the equivalent of $66 billion.“This entire network that was born out of the Bretton Woods system — the Eurodollar market in the 1970s and then the financial deregulation and the floating rates regime in the 1980s — this platform that we have developed so far may be beginning to shift in a more fundamental sense” Lee said.The net result: King Dollar may still reign supreme for decades to come but the building momentum for transactions in alternate currencies shows no sign of slowing — particularly if geopolitical wild cards continue to convince officials to go their own way.And the US government’s willingness to use its currency in geopolitical fights could ironically weaken its ability to pursue such methods as effectively in the future.“The war in Ukraine and the sanctions on Russia will provide a very valuable lesson” Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said last month at the Bloomberg CEO Forum on the sidelines of the G-20 meetings in Bali.“Many countries feel they can do transactions directly — bilaterally — using their local currencies which I think is good for the world to have a much more balanced use of currencies and payment systems.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vZnJlcXVlbnRtaWxlci5jb20vYW1leC1tZW1iZXJzaGlwLXJld2FyZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,American Express Membership Rewards Complete Guide,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vZnJlcXVlbnRtaWxlci5jb20vYW1leC1tZW1iZXJzaGlwLXJld2FyZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021225EA5720>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

On a recent episode of the Stadium Journey Podcast our correspondent Dave Cottenie asked ""how can you not be romantic about baseball?"" Of all the sports none come close to the feelings evoked by a visit to our favorite ballpark.





Stadium Journey endeavors to visit every Major League Baseball ballpark annually to keep our reviews current for those of us who love to travel the country visiting these cathedrals to the sport. In 2022 we were able to visit 21 of the 30 parks nationwide. Not bad considering we're not back to normal.





Here we are ranking the 30 ballparks according to our patented FANFARE rating scale. This scale takes into consideration a ballpark's concessions game day atmosphere neighborhood fan support access value and more. It's a bit of a different way to evaluate a ballpark and historically our rankings have created much debate. That's OK we can take it. Plus isn't healthy debate the reason why we make lists like this?





The fact that over two-thirds of the Major League ballparks scored a 4.00 rating or better is a testament to the quality of the ballparks and the game-day entertainment provided by the team staff around the leagues. To see the full review of each ballpark just click the link underneath the photo.





You'll notice that there have been some changes in our rankings as we move to this new site. There is no longer a place for readers to contribute their scores. After much consideration the decision was made to discontinue crowd reviews as the vast majority of them came from previous Stadium Journey reviews and simply were not being utilized as designed.





Our rankings are now based solely on the reviewer's FANFARE score. Where two or more venues are tied a counsel of Stadium Journey elders is consulted to break any ties. We encourage our readers to share your input on our social media channels. Stadium Journey can be found on Facebook Twitter  and Instagram.





We hope you are enjoying our new site. Without further ado we present our ranking of the 2022 Major League Baseball stadiums.





Andrei Ojeda - Petco Park continues to play a huge role in the revitalization of the local area throughout the East Village. Despite last year’s late-season collapse the excitement level and expectations remain high among the Friar Faithful. Now in its 18th year Petco Park continues to bring high energy to the East Village and continually ranks among the top ballpark experiences year in and year out.





Chris Green - The Guardians continue to showcase what makes their home one of the best home stadiums in the major leagues. Progressive Field has everything you would want in a perfect setting. Top food and beverage options mix here with a constantly improving stadium that remains one of the best in baseball. Affordability and easy access create a welcoming environment that makes for one of the best game-day experiences around.





Andrei Ojeda - One visit to this beauty and you will see why Oracle Park consistently ranks among the top ballpark experiences among baseball fans. As you walk away to the tune of Tony Bennett’s “I Left My Heart in San Francisco” a piece of your heart will undoubtedly be left at 3rd and King.





Paul Baker - Fenway Park’s mix of historical touches quirky features and modern comforts are unmatched anywhere. Other cities try again and again to find the magic formula that has existed in Boston for 111 years. Simply put Fenway Park is the standard against which all other ballparks are measured.

Paul Baker - Fans who haven’t visited the North Side of Chicago in a while will be amazed by the transformation that has taken place in the home of the Cubbies. Modern features have been integrated into the ballpark in a way that does not detract from the historic aspects of the facility. Wrigley Field is truly a special place to take in a baseball game.





Dave Hanson - Citi’s unique location in Flushing extensive food offerings and rabid fanbase make visiting the park feel completely different from the experience across town at Yankee Stadium. Citi Field is a world of its own both of the city and simultaneously removed from the dense urbanity of Manhattan Brooklyn and the Bronx. Yankee Stadium is a tourist trap that happens to contain a baseball diamond. Citi Field is a proper ballpark. There’s a difference.





Patricia Beninato - PNC Park is a mecca for MLB fans two decades after its opening and the recent right field plaza refurbishment combined with a ton of promotions and discounts make it a relatively cheap day or night out for locals and visitors alike. Pittsburgh hopes that one day the Pirates will field a team that’s worthy of the beautiful ballpark they call home.





Andrei Ojeda - Coors Field was among several yards that opened during the so-called “retro parks” era. The recent enhancements to Coors Field most notably the new video/scoreboard and The Rooftop have only helped improve the game day atmosphere. Coors Field trails only Dodger Stadium and Wrigley Field in the National League senior circuit for years of service.





Gregory Koch - The difference between Target Field and the old Metrodome is like night and day. While the Twins previously played in one of the worst stadiums in Major League Baseball they now play at one of the best. Just walking up and gaping at its gorgeous exterior you get the sense that this place is different and once you get inside you will not be disappointed. From the Minnie and Paul sign to the unique concession items to all the other extras here a trip to Target Field for a Twins game should be on every fan’s bucket list.





Andrei Ojeda - The recent enhancements throughout the third oldest yard in the Majors have made the Dodger Stadium experience much more accessible for fans wanting to experience as much of the historic venue and have assured us that Dodger Stadium will be the home to Dodger Baseball for many more years to come.





David Berger - Busch Stadium offers enough history class and views to make it an ideal baseball destination. The ballpark is a favorite among many ballpark enthusiasts and is considered home to many Cardinals fans during the season. Does it have to stand out among the copious “retro-classic” facilities built in the past 25 years? Perhaps Busch doesn’t necessarily need to be anything more than what it is a nice spot for baseball.





Richard Smith - Philadelphia fans often get a bad reputation and it can be well-deserved at times. The stadium itself can also get lost in the sea of new stadiums across the league but the fact is that Citizens Bank Park is a modern ballpark that offers all of the best things that fans expect out of their stadium experience. It should not be forgotten.





Richard Smith - Oriole Park at Camden Yards opened in 1992 and has been considered one of the best Major League Baseball stadiums in the league. Before its opening the landscape of professional baseball was littered with boring multipurpose bowl stadiums. Now nearly every team has a great baseball stadium. Luckily Oriole Park has kept up with the experiences. Out were lackluster parks and in were fan-friendly stadiums that were designed for the optimum fan experience.





Chuck Utech - Stadium journeys have to include a trip to Kansas City. This is an experience for an individual couple or group that can be done at a variety level of expenses. The level of entertainment however is high.





Eric Moreno - After moving out of the Eighth Wonder of the World the Astrodome the Astros moved into their new luxury downtown facilities at (the now-named) Minute Maid Park. From the friendly confines of their new home at the Juice Box the Astros have made the playoffs nine times claimed four pennants (one when they were still in the National League and three since joining the American League) and won one World Series championship in 2017.





Andrei Ojeda - From the baseball-themed artwork to the vast food selections and the majestic views of Puget Sound along the left field upper concourse the cool Pacific Northwest summer nights with a welcoming fan base and an exciting young team a visit to T-Mobile Park will rank highly among your list of ballpark visits.





Richard Smith - The best feature of Comerica Park is the giant Tiger statues that guard the various entrances to the stadium. These are popular photo spots and/or meet-up locations before games. They are not only a great feature but show a team knowing how to double down on their mascot.





Gregory Koch - In 2005 the Nationals came to town and in 2008 they got a brand-new stadium. Since then the excitement has worn off and the crowds have steadily declined especially as the Nationals’ performance on the field has gone downhill. That being said Nationals Park is still a nice stadium for fans to take in a Major League Baseball game.





Marc Viquez - Great American Ballpark is one of the better values in all of Major League Baseball. It includes a modern Stadium with plenty of great views and concession options affordable ticket pricing a great location along the river and multiple entertainment districts surrounding it. Cincinnati is a town that offers a lot of other things to do besides watching the baseball game; you may find yourself spending a lot longer going up and down the hills of Queen City.





Marc Viquez - The Chicago White Sox has been working very hard to improve the amenities at the stadium. The past few seasons have seen renovations to the concourse regarding food and beverage service social areas for fans a brand new scoreboard and fan-friendly pricing on game day tickets. If you haven’t been to a Sox game lately perhaps you need to come back sometime soon for a game.





Meg Minard - Chase Field provides good game day enjoyment and it is easy to reach and traverse. The swimming pool and the retractable roof and panels offer unique elements to the ballpark. A recommendation is to visit early in the season (April) to enjoy a game with the roof open. Phoenix is a vacation destination in early spring and late fall so enjoy a D-Backs game when in town.

Chris Green - Miller Park is a beautiful stadium and it features a unique roof design mixed with appropriate architectural design. The food is plentiful and top quality and the fans are among the best in baseball. Almost every game is a packed house so you get that exciting experience sports fans to yearn for. If you’re visiting Milwaukee or even just passing through a stop here is a must-consider even for the casual sports fan.





Lloyd Brown - A visit to Truist Park and the Battery provides a daylong set of options for baseball fans. Arrive early or stay late and enjoy a wide range of dining and entertainment options. In between you can enjoy some great baseball featuring the defending World Champion Atlanta Braves. Chop on!





Andrei Ojeda - Angel Stadium is the 4th oldest yard in the bigs behind Fenway Park Wrigley Field and Dodger Stadium. It has gone through its share of changes. From being enclosed in 1979 to accommodate the Rams to its return to its current form as a baseball-only park compared to other yards of the post-Camden era Angel Stadium could use some updates.





Chris Green - While many may regard Tropicana Field as one of the worst stadiums in baseball the facility still has some life in it. Yes the age and overall aesthetic of the place just feels “meh” worthy but the Tampa Bay Rays have called it their home since their inception in 1998 and you can almost feel a bit of history when you walk through the ballpark doors.





Dave Cottenie - With the renovations long overdue coming to Rogers Centre it will be interesting to see if as Blue Jays President Mark Shapiro hopes the former SkyDome becomes a “ballpark” and not a “stadium.” What the future holds will be exciting but for now Rogers Centre remains one of the most influential stadiums in the league and one that needs the most TLC.





Greg Venuto - Yankee Stadium overall is impressive and a must-see for baseball enthusiasts. It can be a bit too much splash and often tries too hard to remove as much money as possible from your wallet. Some detractors also say it’s too much of a museum and not enough of a conventional ballpark.





Michael Davis - Globe Life Field is the newest ballpark in Major League Baseball yet it fails compared to the old ballpark. Maybe my emotions have entered into this review as I loved Globe Life Park. Somewhere the baseball fan was forgotten in leaving the old ballpark – overall attending a game at Globe Life Field is more expensive than its predecessor yet the Rangers product on the field is less.





Matt Fiedler - loanDepot Park is a very interesting place. It has some unique features that make it stand out from the pack of bland ballparks. The park does a good job of showcasing Miami's culture and cuisine. The fans and atmosphere drag things down though. The laid-back vibe of Miami does show at the games.





Chris Green - Oakland baseball deserves better – most everyone agrees on this. The fans who do show up are passionate and proud of their team’s history. And while the Athletics have done the best they can with what they have in their current state the shortcomings are so vast that it is hard to overlook one if not most. The beauty of the weather and climate helps but Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum could use a proper facelift to make it more enjoyable for the fan experience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVzY2llbmNlLmNvbS8xMi1kaXNjb3Zlcmllcy1hYm91dC12aXJ1c2Vz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,12 microscopic discoveries that went 'viral' in 2022,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.livescience.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /12-discoveries-about-viruses (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021224F04E80>, 'Connection to www.livescience.com timed out.

They are the patients who have no family members no friends no one able to step up and speak for them. Scores of people young and old who are unable to make decisions for themselves are stuck in legal limbo medically ready to be discharged from Massachusetts hospitals. But they lack a guardian to sign off on discharging them to a nursing home or rehab center.

The guardianship process say those on the front lines is also one of the most soul-wrenching tasks they encounter.

“It pulls at your heartstrings and it makes you think how lucky you are that you have a family who is supportive of each other” said Deb Hansen a registered nurse and director of case management at Sturdy Memorial Hospital in Attleboro.

“Your heart goes out” Hansen said “because they don’t have that support except for us to be holding their hand and talk to them.”

At least 958 patients statewide were awaiting discharge in November many for more than a month to a nursing home or other post-acute facility according to the most recent monthly survey from the Massachusetts Health & Hospital Association. Exactly how many of these patients are mired in legal issues related to guardianship is unclear but the association estimates that more than 100 patients are languishing in this state.

Hospital leaders in the recent survey listed guardianship problems as the second most challenging issue they faced when trying to discharge patients right behind dealing with insurance company delays in authorizing coverage.

Hospital administrators say too often patients before they are hospitalized fail to complete a health care proxy form a simple document that designates a representative to make health care decisions for the patient if he or she is incapacitated.

“It’s such a simple document anybody can pull it off online to do this” said Joan Smith director of social work services at Tufts Medical Center. “You don’t have to be in the hospital to do it.”

Without that form incapacitated patients most often older people with dementia or younger patients who’ve had a brain injury get stuck in the hospital as administrators embark on a legal maze seeking a court-appointed guardian. That guardian will have the authority to sign off on transferring the patient to more appropriate post-acute care.

The legal part of the process administrators say usually takes about a month. But there are cases that drag on much longer.

Earlier in the pandemic Sturdy Memorial cared for a young man in his 20s who was with them for a year. His medical care was completed in a couple of months but the courts backlogged by the pandemic took a few more months to appoint a social worker as guardian. By then the man’s family had stopped visiting and it became clear they were not going to take care of him when he was discharged.

The young man’s cognition level was high enough that staffers could hold a conversation with him and to know he was desperately seeking friends but it was not enough to live alone or take care of himself.

“There was a vulnerability about him and we understood that he felt abandoned by his family” said Robin Morris the hospital’s senior vice president of clinical operations.

More months went by as the guardian struggled to find an appropriate place. The patient celebrated a birthday with staff bringing him a cake.

“He wanted a life outside of the hospital; he wanted someone to care about him” Morris said.

More months dragged by.

“He became part of the family here” Morris said. “Staff came in with their families so he wouldn’t be alone on Christmas.”

While the Sturdy case stretched longer than most the painstaking steps that staff at most hospitals take are similar as they try to find someone to speak for a patient so their case doesn’t end up in the courts.

“We start by trying to track down anyone we can” said Dr. Rachel Kester medical director of inpatient geriatric services at Cambridge Health Alliance.

“Usually we can get in touch with a neighbor” Kester said. “We usually find someone who knows them at least a little bit.” A friend or neighbor could file with the state’s Probate and Family Court to become a legal guardian. But Kester said friends and neighbors are not often willing or able to do that.

Hospital case workers say they scour patients’ medical records going back years searching for a health care proxy. Failing that they may reach out to social service agencies from the patient’s community as well as local senior service offices in case they have records of a family contact who may be willing to be appointed as a legal guardian.

Seeking a court-appointed guardian they say is a last resort.

“One thing that makes me feel very sad is that our [guardianship] patients have to wait so long in the hospital before they can move on” Kester said. “No one should have to live in a hospital.”

The Massachusetts Health & Hospital Association said it has made recommendations to the state’s court system to try and streamline the guardianship process. For instance it suggests family and probate courts reserve blocks of time each week in each county devoted to these cases.

“We are aware of three counties that have implemented the dedicated block days within the courts” the association said in a statement. “We are grateful for those and hope to ... see that grow.”

Jennifer Donahue a trial court spokeswoman said in a statement that Suffolk County where many hospitals are located is among those instituting the dedicated weeks.

And she said the Probate and Family Court has expanded electronic-filing options in every county for conservatorships. That’s when a court appoints a person to manage the financial and personal affairs of a minor or incapacitated person. A conservator may also serve as a guardian.

The electronic filing can save lawyers time and shorten the process a bit but she said there is a good reason that cases can take a long time.

“Massachusetts guardianship law is complex and filled with procedural safeguards to protect the rights of persons alleged to be incapacitated” Donahue said.

But as the cases drag on patients can grow despondent hospital case workers said. And many patients are not getting the level of rehabilitation they would receive in post-acute care.

Some patients may not have the mental capacity to understand why they have been stuck in a hospital so long. But others like the young man at Sturdy Memorial was keenly aware.

Finally a year after he entered Sturdy his court-appointed guardian found an adult-care foster family who stepped forward and he went to live with them.

Shortly after the family sent the hospital staff a picture of the young man from a trip they took him on to the beach.

He was smiling.

Rep.-elect George Santos told The New York Post he fabricated key details about his credentials.

The report confirmed an earlier investigation by The New York Times claiming Santos misled voters.

Santos lied about working for Goldman Sachs and Citigroup and graduating from Baruch College.

New York Rep.-elect George Santos told The New York Post on Monday that he lied about his education and work experience confirming an earlier New York Times investigation that found he likely misrepresented his background to voters.

The Republican congressman-elect elected in November to represent parts of Long Island and Queens told The Post that his fabrications wouldn't stop him from assuming office.

""I am not a criminal"" Santos told The Post.

Santos admitted to The Post that he fabricated several details regarding his professional and educational background including claims that he worked for Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. He said Monday that he ""never worked directly"" for either of the major Wall Street banks calling claims that he worked there ""a poor choice of words.""

Santos told The Post that he actually worked for Link Bridge a company he said did business with both firms.

He also admitted that he never graduated from college. Santos had previously claimed to be a 2010 graduate of Baruch College. The New York Times investigation revealed that Baruch College had no record of Santos as a student.

Santos also addressed a report from the Jewish news outlet The Forward that appeared to show he lied about his family background on his campaign website which said that his mother was Jewish and his grandparents had escaped the Nazis during the Holocaust.

""I never claimed to be Jewish"" Santos told The Post saying that his grandmother ""told stories about being Jewish"" before converting to Catholicism. ""I am Catholic. Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background I said I was 'Jew-ish.'""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vbWFya2V0L3N0b2NrLW1hcmtldC1uZXdzL2dvbGRtYW4tc2FjaHMtYnV5cy1sYW5kbWFyay1jYXJzLXNoYXJlcy13b3J0aC1ycy0xOC0zMC1jcm9yZS1zaG91bGQteW91LWJ1eS0xMTY3MjA0MzUyNDE5OS5odG1s0gGVAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9tYXJrZXQvc3RvY2stbWFya2V0LW5ld3MvZ29sZG1hbi1zYWNocy1idXlzLWxhbmRtYXJrLWNhcnMtc2hhcmVzLXdvcnRoLXJzLTE4LTMwLWNyb3JlLXNob3VsZC15b3UtYnV5L2FtcC0xMTY3MjA0MzUyNDE5OS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Goldman Sachs buys Landmark Cars shares worth ₹18.30 crore.

As per the in formation available on NSE website Goldman Sachs India Equity Portfolio has bought 392421 Landmark Cars share. Goldman Sachs bought these shares paying ₹466.55 apiece.

What emerged as a result was job seekers becoming prime targets for employment related scams.

In a recent case CA finalist Ritika Rawat took to the professional network LinkedIn to share her encounter with a job scam on the platform.

Rawat on November 18 2022 thought she bagged the perfect opportunity in her career after she received an offer from Goldman Sachs (GS). However the real story began when she noticed ""a blunder"" in the ID creation at Goldman Sachs.

On LinkedIn Rawat was promised that she is already selected at Goldman Sachs and an interview is to be conducted just for formalities. The message also said that in case she was not interested in GS then the person could also refer her resume to JP Morgan.

""At first I was so happy that I was selected without an interview and was so grateful to him. But my skeptical side was not able to digest that a person at that level (AD) is helping me to get a job in GS"" she said in her post.

On November 17 Rawat had posted on LinkedIn that she is a looking for a job in the Transfer Pricing (TP) domain post which she claimed that she ""got many job offers.""

She narrated that she was first reached through LinkedIn and later on WhatsApp for her ""exact address"" in order to create an ID on the GS website which is the first step for the interview process. She was then asked for her passport-size photo as well after which her ID got created.

""After a day I noticed that the job description was for ""Associate Quantitative Engineer"". So I questioned him about this. He replied that the email was a mistake and I would be interviewed for TP only. Still I was not convinced and argued a lot about everything"" she stated.

Later on Rawat said that she searched on Google about job scams and found out there are a lot of victims of job scams.

Highlighting how job scams are done she listed out the steps on her post. She said first a person will receive a message that their CV has been shortlisted. A real ID will be created on the GS portal and confirmation will be sent From GS's original email id.

Post that a meeting link from a fake email address will then be received for an interview. ""After two rounds of interviews you will be selected for those fake interviews"" she pointed.

""They will inform you that you are selected but for joining you have to pay 40-50k for other joining formalities and that will be reimbursed to you during your job"" Rawat highlighted.

She also warned people not to fall for such traps. ""Many candidates will pay the amount as they think they were originally interviewed by Goldman Sachs (GS) only"" Rawat mentioned in her post.

“I am not a criminal” Santos said at one point during his exclusive interview. “This [controversy] will not deter me from having good legislative success. I will be effective. I will be good.”

Santos’ professional biography was called into question earlier this month after the New York Times reported that he misrepresented a number of claims including where he attended college and his alleged employment history with high-profile Wall Street firms.

“My sins here are embellishing my resume. I’m sorry” Santos said Monday.

Santos confessed he had “never worked directly” for Goldman Sachs and Citigroup chalking that fib up to a “poor choice of words.”

The 34-year-old now claims instead that a company called Link Bridge where he worked as a vice president did business with both of the financial giants.

“I will be clearer about that. It was stated poorly” Santos said of the lie.

At Link Bridge Santos said he helped make “capital introductions” between clients and investors and Goldman Sachs and Citigroup were “LPS Limited Partnerships” that his company dealt with.

He also admitted that he never graduated from any college despite previously claiming to have received a degree from Baruch in 2010.

“I didn’t graduate from any institution of higher learning. I’m embarrassed and sorry for having embellished my resume” he said. “I own up to that … We do stupid things in life.”

Santos elected to Congress on Nov. 8 to represent the Long Island- and Queens-based 3rd District was also accused of lying about his family history saying on his campaign website that his mother was Jewish and his grandparents escaped the Nazis during World War II.

Santos now says that he’s “clearly Catholic” but claimed his grandmother told stories about being Jewish and later converting to Catholicism.

“I never claimed to be Jewish” Santos said. “I am Catholic. Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background I said I was ‘Jew-ish.'”

Santos the first openly gay non-incumbent Republican elected to the House also faced accusations that he lied about his sexual orientation with the Daily Beast reporting last week that he was previously married to a woman until shortly before he launched his unsuccessful 2020 campaign against Democrat Tom Suozzi.

The soon-to-be lawmaker confirmed to The Post on Monday that he was indeed married to a woman for about five years from 2012 until his divorce in 2017 but insisted that he is now a happily married gay man.

“I dated women in the past. I married a woman. It’s personal stuff” Santos said adding that the relationship “got a little toxic.”

“I’m very much gay” he says now. “I’m OK with my sexuality. People change. I’m one of those people who change.”

Santos also acknowledged being a deadbeat tenant in Sunnyside Queens where the Times reported he was ordered by a judge to pay more than $12000 to a former landlord who claimed non-payment of several months of rent — as well as that Santos had tried to pass a check that bounced.

On Monday Santos claimed that at the time of the lawsuit his family was deep in medical debt from his mother’s cancer battle.

“We were engulfed in debt” he said. “We had issues paying rent at the time. It’s the vulnerability of being human. I am not embarrassed by it.”

Santos said his mother died of cancer on Dec. 23 2016 after living with him at the Queens apartment and acknowledged the judgment against him.

Asked if he ever actually paid the arrears Santos admitted: “We didn’t pay it off. I completely forgot about it.”

Santos also admitted to lying when he claimed that he owned 13 different properties saying he now resides at his sister’s place in Huntington but is looking to purchase his own place.

“George Santos does not own any properties” he said.

Santos was defiant on one point — denying an allegation raised by the Times that he had an unspecified criminal charge filed against him in Brazil.

“I am not a criminal here — not here or in Brazil or any jurisdiction in the world” Santos said. “Absolutely not. That didn’t happen.”

The incoming congressman dismissed concerns that his lies will impact his effectiveness in representing New Yorkers in the lower chamber in the new year.

“I campaigned talking about the people’s concerns not my resume” Santos told The Post.

“I intend to deliver on the promises I made during the campaign — fighting crime fighting to lower inflation improving education” he added saying that “The people elected me to fight for them.”

“I came to DC to bring results on those issues and that’s what I’m going to do.”

Meanwhile Santos said the $11 million in assets reported in his financial disclosure report filed in September are tied to his Devolder consulting firm.

“All of my finances come from the firm. The assets are the contracts with the firm” he told The Post.

His campaign committee Devolder-Santos for Congress also reported that he personally loaned his campaign more than $600000.

Senior House Republicans were apparently aware of the inaccuracies and embellishments in the member-elect’s resume and the topic became a “running joke” multiple insiders close to House GOP leadership told The Post over the weekend.

“As far as questions about George in general that was always something that was brought up whenever we talked about this race” said one senior GOP leadership aide. “It was a running joke at a certain point. This is the second time he’s run and these issues we assumed would be worked out by the voters.”

Last week the top Republican in Nassau County demanded that Santos explain himself after his web of lies began to unravel.

“While I have indicated that the congressman-elect deserves a reasonable amount of time to respond to the media voters deserve a sincere accounting from Mr. Santos” said Nassau County Republican Committee Chairman Joseph Cairo. “I will be listening attentively and I want to hear meaningful remarks from George Santos.”

That same day Santos broke his three-day silence since reports of his prevarications emerged tweeting: “To the people of #NY03 I have my story to tell and it will be told next week. I want to assure everyone that I will address your questions and that I remain committed to deliver the results I campaigned on; Public Safety Inflation Education & more.”

He then added: “Happy Holidays to all!”"

Barry Nelsen was a junior at Canton High School. According to Principal Andrew DiPippo the 17-year-old joined the school in August and ""immediately made a positive impact with his kindness and positive outlook.""

""While quiet Raheim had a wonderful sense of humor who openly shared his friendly and supportive disposition with all"" he said in a statement sent to the school community.

The teenager was a member of the school's varsity basketball team.

""He was kind dedicated talented and much loved by his teammates and coaches"" head coach Bill Phelps said in a statement.

Police said the West Hartford Accident Reconstruction Team is actively investigating this incident and Simsbury Road has been closed between Bloomfield Avenue to Mohegan Drive during the investigation.

Two cars crashed shortly before 6:49 a.m. Sunday morning.

Two occupants were pronounced dead on the scene while the third was transported to the hospital.

The third victim was later pronounced dead at the hospital.

West Hartford police identified the victims as Raheim Dante Barry Nelson 17 of Hartford Faye Dawson-Judkins 52 of Hartford and Novelette Bailey 55 of Hartford.

Officials say Raheim Dante Barry Nelson was the son of Faye Dawson Judkins.

The road was shut down from Mohegan Drive to Bloomfield Avenue for an accident investigation but has since reopened.

“We are deeply saddened and heartbroken by the tragic loss of life especially during this holiday season” said Mayor Shari G. Cantor. “The families and friends of those involved in today’s incident will be in our thoughts and prayers.”

West Hartford has seen multiple fatal crashes recently including a 60-year-old Bridgeport resident who died after being struck by a car and an 89-year-old West Hartford resident who was killed in a hit and run.

In light of these events Mayor Cantor says she has spoken with the Town Manager to convene a task force on traffic and pedestrian safety.

“The Town Council wants actionable steps we can take to make our roads safer” said Cantor.

The Town Manager Richard C. Ledwith said the safety of residents and travelers on roads are always a top priority.

“Although the fatal motor vehicle collisions that have occurred in town over the last week are isolated incidents any loss of life is unacceptable” said Ledwith. “We are constantly studying evaluating and improving road safety and plans are already underway to step those efforts up with the creation of a traffic and pedestrian safety task force.”

Police Chief Vernon Riddick urged pedestrians and motor vehicle operators to follow traffic laws.

“There are many factors that come into play involving motor vehicle collisions and especially motor vehicle and pedestrian collisions” said Chief Riddick. “The consequences of a crash between a 4000 pound vehicle and a human being can result in death or serious physical injury. Motor vehicle operators and pedestrians must comply with the law. Moreover I strongly urge motor vehicle operators and pedestrians to avoid distractions such as cell phones ear phones etc. and to focus their attention on the road – literally lives depend upon it.”

Many residents think the task force is a good idea.

The tragedy on Sunday is the latest deadly crash in town.

“Obviously it’s horrible” said Tamara Schmidt of West Hartford.

Town officials say the collisions are isolated but regardless any loss of life is unacceptable.

“I’m glad to hear about the task force” said Jill Shalan of West Hartford. “Make it a lot safer a lot quicker. Yeah get people off their phones.”

“I don’t know if people need to just take more pause in their lives or what. It’s just being more aware of other people really” said Tamara Schmidt of West Hartford.

Tamara thinks the task force is a good idea.

“Yeah fantastic. Whatever they can come up with to try to come up with a solution I say more power to them” Tamara said.

West Hartford residents hope to see safety improve throughout town.

“I think ever since COVID people have been driving worse either too fast or too slow and they’re on their phones” said Jill.

Plans are already underway though specific details have not yet been released.

More details on that task force will be released in the coming days.

There have been three total fatal crashes within the last two weeks.

Officials are asking drivers to avoid distractions behind the wheel.

Three people have died following an accident on Simsbury Road.

By Ronni Newton

Eleven days after graduating from Farmington High School in June 2022 Luke Roux was driving home from a baseball game when he tragically lost his life after his car was struck by a drunk driver on Colt Highway.

While he was a Farmington resident Luke had many ties to West Hartford as well and at age 5 began playing in the West Hartford Youth Hockey League where his father Steve Roux coached for 16 years.

Prior to the start of the Conard vs. Hall boys hockey game on Monday the first scholarship from the Luke Roux Memorial Fund was awarded to Conard senior hockey player Gavin McGowan.

In addition to awarding the $500 scholarship the Luke Roux Memorial Fund will support further education and awareness of the dangers of drinking and driving. The Conard and Hall hockey booster clubs each donated to the Memorial Fund.

Also at the game Luke’s parents were presented with a No. 16 jersey – their son’s last youth hockey number – signed by many former teammates who now play for Conard or Hall. A plaque with the names of award recipients will hang at Veterans Rink.

West Hartford Wolves coach Kevin Miller coached Luke Roux in youth hockey and many of the town’s hockey players attended his funeral last summer at Molloy Funeral Home in West Hartford.

An excerpt from the fundraising campaign started in Luke Roux’s honor reads: “Luke was an athlete: ice hockey baseball tennis swimming and his latest passion disc golf. Luke was a gamer and participated in e-sports events. Luke was a lover of music and a musician: an eclectic taste in music mostly leaning toward progressive rock an accomplished drummer violin keyboards and guitar. Luke was a scholar: math was by far his biggest strength and he graduated High School with first honors. UConn recognized his strength and interest in math by awarding him academic scholarship support. Luke was prepared and fully equipped to continue spreading his love and kindness beyond his family friends and the Farmington community before his life was cut short.” Donations can be made by clicking on this link.

Conard won Monday’s game beating Hall 7-4.

Spotted earlier this month at German ComicCon the entire display stretches 40 feet in length. Made to replicate the Ghostbusters Firehouse highlights include Janine’s office a basement complete with an Ecto-Containment Unit and in a clear nod to both Ghostbusters II & Ghostbusters: The Video Game a replica Vigo the Carpathian painting.





Being a fan you’ve likely already noticed the incredible print details and various Easter eggs found on the structure walls from the Firehouse’s first-floor green and white brickwork Peter Venkman’s office fictitious magazine covers and behind-the-scenes set photos.

A few nods paying homage to the character of Egon Spengler played in the first two Ghostbusters films by the late Harold Ramis can also be found. These include a printed framed photo from the production of Ghostbusters: Afterlife and a bust of the character accompanied by his favorite junk food and samples of spores molds and fungus.

Of course We Are Ghostbusters “Germany” members are on call talking with fans and posing for photos. We especially love the more in-character costumes providing the franchise with its resident Janine Melnitz Phoebe Spengler and an entertaining take on Mooglie the Ghostbusters logo.

For those lucky enough to experience the attraction firsthand a rousing game of electro-shock therapy is also available. We’re just hoping that We Are Ghostbusters “Germany” tend to be a bit more honest than Bill Murray’s Peter Venkman character.





Alongside the Firehouse a smaller area can be found dedicated to the Sedgwick Hotel recreating our introduction to Slimer with the disgusting blob accompanied by a food cart.

For those unaware of what that alt mode is it looks like the image below.





We had seen that there are many collaborative projects coming up and now we have a rumour for the next one from JTPrime17. The next G1 Joe Transformers collaborative project is rumoured to be a Dreadnoks Soundwave that turns into the Thundermachine. This set would include an O-ring Zartan and Zarana plus Ravage with chain. Of course we repeat only a rumour right now and release plans are constantly changing.For those unaware of what that alt mode is it looks like the image below.

If that rumor is true and the bot mode is not a pile of kibble cancer like Bee I'd be all over it. Posted by -Kanrabat- on December 25th 2022 @ 3:14pm CST

This kind of make sense: The Dreadnoks were a mini-team more loyal to Zartan than the rest of Cobra memorable and beloved by fans due in part to their use of unconventional weapons and more savage fighting style so if you had to pick some Cobra characters that were the equivalent of Soundwave and the cassettes they're the best fit.

I guess this was more successful than we gave them credit for (though there's still time for this to be cancelled). The initial report when Megatron was leaked was that they were only doing two figures. At least this time we're potentially getting one that'll be mostly the correct color in both modes.

Too small or too big for what I want. But then what I really want is a G1 Soundwave with a surveillance plane alt in line with Prime. That... certainly is a vehicle. As Soundwave I am indifferent and ultimately these are not going to be in a scale I want for my main shelf. But after seeing the picture of the ""car"" I really wish they would pull a Snowcat and give us this as a Decepticon in line with the main offerings. Because that this is wicked and weird lookingToo small or too big for what I want. But then what I really want is a G1 Soundwave with a surveillance plane alt in line with Prime.

It would be quite difficult to turn a bot that is basically a bunch of boxes strung together to an altmode that is sleek and full of curves.



The Siege space barge was the best possible flying vehicle possible to make from the G1 bot.



A ""G1ified"" Prime Soundwave could manage it I guess.

Don't think they'd go to far from main lines for either.



My belief is still Optimus (because they already did Megatron) but options may include:



HAVOC- may allow for bot mode to be comparable to Megs due to removal of hover vehicle despite larger vehicle size



Tiger Cat- longer armored Jeep-type vehicle



Mean Dog- longer vehicle splits in two normally could allow for an armored Prime to counter Megs heavily armed bot mode



MOBAT- because Prime as a tank is long overdue.



""In Your Dreams"" vehicle: Rolling Thunder. 'Nuff said!

The other two looked pretty dire. So I'm not hopeful that this one will course correct the ""Bot in cosplay kibble"" aesthetic that BB and Megs enjoy. The comic book crossover designs ala Dreamwave & IDW seem to grasp the concept a whole lot better than Hasbro does.

Right the Rhino as Optimus seems like an obvious choice but that would probably work as a deco only and not include any of the original play features. That would be the issue for most of the line.



On the other hand the iconic Thunderhawk had only two main functions that I recall the gull wing doors and a minor change with the bumper and spoiler. I think they should be able to develop a 3.75"" compatible functional figure with similar engineering to Siege Sideswipe. I would really like to see that as a one-off.

Most of the MASK vehicles are essentially triple changers EG Switchblade. Not a completely alien concept to Transformers.

Yeah MASK had it's time. Even IDW botched it as a revival. Chiefly because I don't think it works in a shared universe. Particularly the same one as Transformers. The only dormant 80's property I think still deserves a revival is Bravestarr.



GI Joe's popularity is a strange one to me. I dunno maybe it is a popular thing in America? But I don't hear too many people that actually like it globally. Certain characters have pop culture status IE Cobra Commander or Destro. But personally I couldn't name more than probably ten characters?

GI Joe is conceived as an American brand especially the 80s version which is what all this is based on. It makes sense that it wouldn't have much appeal outside of the US if that is indeed the case.

Most M.A.S.K vehicles barely ""transform"" anyway and we already have some Transformers with ""M.A.S.K.ish"" altmodes like Autobot Tracks or even ROTF Megatron. But what will make them never happen is the obscurity of the line. The Joe-Xover is a miracle to have ever happen and it's a HUGE brand.



BTW my Megatron from Amazon.ca was delayed once again a few weeks ago but today I just ""nudged"" it by ""modifying"" the delivery date. So in theory I should finally have it in 2 days. Posted by -Kanrabat- on December 26th 2022 @ 10:08am CST

The other factor for G.I.Joe ARAH is that it hasn't aged all that great due to real world events. In one of Jim Sorenson's animation model books there's a note from Buzz Dixon (I think?) that episodes should be structured like mini James Bond movies when possible. Well one thing the '80s Joe has in common with James Bond is that they don't make as much sense now that the Cold War is over.



And while I agree that making TFs turn into functional MASK vehicles would just create toys that are jumbled messes it always seemed like MASK would actually make sense in a TF universe with the same dynamics as early Marvel continuity where the public feared and hated Autobots and Decepticons alike. R.A.A.T. creating vehicles that partially emulated Cybertronian transformation abilities to hunt down TFs would've made more sense than the full-on sci-fi vehicles they started deploying in the latter half of Budianski's run.

If Soundwave's true I hope they learn from the previous two collabs. But it's probably been in development close to the other two so likely not.



SW is a good choice. He's an iconic TF. I have to admit I don't care about the Ravage with a collar. I'd rather they have redecoed a G1 Ravage into Black Cat. And have G1 tape compatibility!

Pros:

- Big and commanding presence.

- Kibble management is good and the backpack is forgiven because it serves as a ""baby seat"" for a Joe figure.

- Megatron do look like Megatron.

- The vehicle is just PERFECT and is clearly the main mode.

- The Baroness figure is excellent at this scale.

- The transformation was very interesting to figure out.



Cons:

- Too many hollow spaces that needs filling for the bot mode. Especially for Meg's classic arm canon. That's unforgivable.

- Poseability is very limited for the bot mode.

- Transformation is a bit fiddly toward the end to make sure everything align and tab properly.

- Not worth the full 130$CAN at all. It should have been at maximum the same price as the Joe Bee. But that's the price I paid so it's all good.



Conclusion:

Expensive yes but I'm glad I didn't missed out on this flawed yet pretty cool thing. I might get the Bee while I'm at it. I finally did my HISS Tank Megatron. So have my TlDr review:Pros:- Big and commanding presence.- Kibble management is good and the backpack is forgiven because it serves as a ""baby seat"" for a Joe figure.- Megatron do look like Megatron.- The vehicle is just PERFECT and is clearly the main mode.- The Baroness figure is excellent at this scale.- The transformation was very interesting to figure out.Cons:- Too many hollow spaces that needs filling for the bot mode.

Technically The Baroness IS a HISS tank driver. It was on her original file card and her being disfigured while driving a HISS was a major storyline in the comics.

The bot was better than expected despite the fact that just a good shake is enough to untab the whole torso. As for the transformation and the vehicle? Chef kiss.



I wouldn't have paid full price for it. But as a trade-in against some unwanted used Transformers? Count me in!



I'm looking forward the rest of this libe if they ever happen.

While I like these figures overall there are some pretty obvious problems that are pretty hard to ignore. If I were to refine it down to my two biggest gripes it would be:



- Megatron's small hollow fusion cannon with half the bottom cut out so it only looks ok when viewed from above.

- Bumblebee's roll cage that gets in the way restricts all movement; from the hinges and shoulderpad design it looks like it was designed to sit even lower but doing so restricts everything even further!



Does anyone know what the chances of getting upgrade kits for these might be? Maybe even just from one of the little guys making the 3D printed part/shapeways stuff?



If anyone has seen anything along these lines let me know. I'd love to find a better cannon and a rollcage with few extra hinges that can fold up out of the way. Posted by SimianProphet on January 1st 2023 @ 1:04pm CST

I have three or four Siege and Earthrise Megatrons so I'm not hurting for fusion cannons. They might be a tad small for his size but nothing that bothers me. Then again I wasn't too concerned by the hollow parts to begin with. I've found the best way to appreciate my toys is to manage my expectations rather than correct Hasbro's production decisions.

I saw on some forum that an upgrade kit is being made for Megatron but that's yet to be truly confirmed. A bit baffling that it's not already being done.



As for Bee's roll-cage I don't think a ""further folding"" one is possible. Simply because THAT'S the very thing that's holding the whole vehicle together. So unless you want your dune-buggy to be like a wet noodle you have to make do with the solid roll-cage.

That is a good point on the BB roll cage providing stability in vehicle mode. Mine holds together fairly well in alt mode without the front of the roll cage being tabbed in but I'm also not 'playing' with it that mode. I'm not putting extra figures into passenger seats/side boards/back turret or even rolling it around but I could imagine it being less stable if I did.



That all said I'm still hoping to see a roll cage upgrade of some sort one day. Posted by SimianProphet on January 1st 2023 @ 4:46pm CST

The roll-cage in bot mode is cumbersome but not a dealbreaker for me. What it is is the fact that Bee's chest barely tab together. So just a wee bit of play make the whole thing come undone. Is it just my copy or is it a widespread issue? The roll-cage in bot mode is cumbersome but not a dealbreaker for me. What it is is the fact that Bee's chest barely tab together.

I was of the same mind about BB's chest not clipping together well until the last time I changed it and with enough force I was able to clip the chest together better.



The black strut should be straight up and down inside flush up against the backside of the chest piece. there are two tabs that hold it in place when doing this a vertical one along the center of the black strut and the more obvious one one at the bottom. with both tabs in their slot the chest is very stable. I can pick the toy up by its chest piece and shake it around and it does not come loose.



It takes much more force to clip this in to the point I was a bit worried about damaging the figure but it all seems good! Posted by SimianProphet on January 2nd 2023 @ 12:03am CST

I've never been sure about most of the G.I. Joe vehicles. Sure they look cool. And with a toy that's usually the main point. But I always wind up looking at a vehicle with an eye to how practical it would be in real life. For the Triple T there's two 'kinds' of vehicles it might be and what kind it is would determine whether it would be practical.



If it's an all-terrain transport then it might be OK. It looks like it might do well over fields dirt rocky ground sand and so on. But if it's a tank that's supposed to protect the occupant? Then it would be terrible. The driver is completely exposed to enemy gunfire and so is anybody hanging onto the sides. The purpose of a tank is to shield the occupants as well as inflicting damage. It doesn't look like the Triple T would do that. And it's not a slam particularly against the Triple T. A large amount of the G.I. Joe vehicles did that. It was great for the toys which needed an easy-access cockpit so you could jam the figures in as pilots/drivers. But for real-world military application? The designs were not very good.

The Triple T is even structurally similar to Grimlock's War Within tank mode.

Goddamn...if it IS Grimlock I may have to get this.



Though I wonder...the bot choices haven't exactly been in line with the vehicles. Soundwave would've made more sense with a spy plane or a trouble bubble with a Tele-Viper instead of the Thunder Machine. Hound would've made a great choice for the jeep-like AWE Striker...

This new version of the game available only in Canada simply has players end the patient's life immediately.

""For sure this is a much more relatable version of the game for consumers here in Canada eh?"" said Owen Hansen Hasbro's Regional Operations Manager for Canada. ""The way we figure youngsters here in The Great White North don't really need to know much about performing life-saving operations so we'll just have ‘em put the poor hoser out of his misery.""

As a part of the revision there will no longer be any bones or body parts for players to remove from the patient with electronic tweezers. Instead there will simply be one single slot in the patient's chest into which players will insert a knife. The only way to lose the game is to not end the patient's life within the allotted time.

""Yes this is a much more true-to-life version of the game for kids here in Canada unfortunately"" said author psychologist professor and famous Canadian Dr. Jordan B. Peterson. ""But what are the long-term consequences of teaching children to end lives rather than attempt to save them? You think it's a harmless game but it's not!""

At publishing time Hasbro was hoping sales numbers for the new game would be high for the Christmas season with preliminary plans to follow it up with a new Canadian version of the game Clue in which players would simply move room to room through a mansion while performing euthanasia on other characters.

America is one of the world's most industrialized regions with the largest economy in nominal terms. This also makes it one of the world's largest consumers of electricity ranking second only to China through 3.9 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2021. In terms of sources of energy consumption petroleum and natural gas account for the largest sources and renewable energy ranks in third place. Sector wise industrial transportation and electrical power use are the largest electricity consumers in the U.S. and natural gas is the most widely used production source according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Courtesy of some of the best educational institutions in the world the U.S. is also leading the charge in researching innovative mediums for generating renewable energy. Not only is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) an American firm the world's first car maker to successfully mass produce an electric vehicle but researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are investigating methods to improve electricity generation through waves and the Sun as well as new mediums to store electricity. While solar cells are common these days these materials are unable to tap the vast amounts of energy that the Sun beams down to the Earth. On this front MIT is searching for materials that are cost effective scalable reliable and efficient at the same time. To do this they are utilizing machine learning and rapid experimentation to quickly sift through materials in hopes that a new one will provide a breakthrough.

When talking about energy any discussion would be incomplete without nuclear power plants. There are two kinds of nuclear reactions fission and fusion. With the former atoms are split up to squeeze out energy from them. However the latter is vastly more powerful (and complex) since it requires squeezing the atoms together and the resulting energy is harnessed as power. Fusion is the Sun's primary energy source and all nuclear plants in the world use fission instead. In the area of fusion the U.S. federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California was able to generate more energy from a Hydrogen plasma bombarded with lasers than the electricity used in operating the lasers instead. This was a crucial breakthrough since fusion is the most efficient and cleanest source of power - even on the nuclear front as it does not generate any radioactive waste.

Story continues

Additionally America also passed one of the most important pieces of legislation for renewable energy this year in form of the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill provides roughly $370 billion in government subsidies for clean power generation. This provides the incentive for even some of the biggest American energy companies to invest in the field. Finally global crude oil prices have injected fresh rigor into renewable energy production after they jumped to a whopping $139 per barrel earlier this year in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Today we'll take a look at the largest American energy firms with the top picks being Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE).

Hart Energy in a report published on Thursday detailed that Guyana and Brazil are expected to produce an additional 850000 barrels of oil per day in 2023 from new oil ships.

Although other countries in the region including Colombia Mexico and Venezuela are oil producers the report said that the continental neighbours will see greater output.

“…the lion’s share of the production will come from developments in exploration hotspots Brazil and Guyana” the report noted.

With production underway at two developments- the Liza I and Liza II- in Guyana’s prolific Stabroek Block the country is already producing about 360000 barrels of oil per day.

Production at this block is managed by an ExxonMobil-led consortium that includes the United States’ Hess Corporation and China’s CNOOC.

According to Hart Energy in late 2023 once production at the new development Payara starts output should increase by 220000 barrels of oil per day.

At Payara a new Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel or oil ship known as the Liza Prosperity will produce oil.

In 2025 and 2026 new developments at the Yellowtail and Uaru projects are expected to come on stream.

Meanwhile Petrobras estimates that another 630000 barrels of oil will be added to Brazil’s production in 2023. This output is expected to come from five oil ships.

The report also noted that another 13 new oil ships will start production in Brazil between 2024 and 2027.",,,,,,,,,

She’s been trying to retrieve her missing points since then but Hilton won’t budge.

Can a consumer advocate rescue her points?

Maybe. Earlier this year after a lengthy ban my advocacy team and I started accepting loyalty program cases. We’ve helped readers get massive refunds on their credit card points and lent a hand with some loyalty card insurance claims. But mostly our consumer advocacy team has kept a low profile on loyalty problems.

Giammanco’s case is different. Her problem raises questions about the value of Hilton’s program and the best way of approaching Hilton when you have a points problem. Ultimately it underscores the fact that travel companies can do almost anything they want when it comes to your loyalty points — and that you need to become your own advocate to get the most out of these programs.

A canceled stay — but the Hilton points were gone

Giammanco cashed in 40000 Hilton points for a night at the Hilton Garden Inn in Dalton Ga. But her plans changed while she was in Georgia and while she was a guest at the Doubletree by Hilton Atlanta Airport she canceled her stay in Dalton.

“A representative from the Doubletree front desk said the points would revert back to my account” she says.

“I’ve called and emailed Hilton support” she says. “I’ve received promises from Hilton Honors to return the points. But it never happens and I keep being pushed to another supervisor with no results.”

But wait — are Hilton points refundable? Yes they are. Almost all Hilton hotels will let you cancel an award night booking if you do it at least two days before your arrival. The points should show up in your account immediately. Giammanco had canceled before her deadline but something may have gotten lost in translation when she canceled the reservation in person.

Are Hilton points worth collecting?

Hilton Honors is the loyalty program offered by Hilton Hotels & Resorts. If you belong to its Hilton Honors program you can earn and redeem points for stays at participating Hilton properties and other travel and leisure activities. But is it worth participating in Hilton’s loyalty program?

The pros of participating in Hilton Honors

Wide range of redemption options: You can redeem Hilton Honors points for stays at more than 6000 Hilton properties worldwide including luxury brands like Waldorf Astoria and Conrad Hotels & Resorts. You can also cash in your Hilton Honors points for flights car rentals and other travel experiences through the Hilton Honors travel portal.

Many ways to earn points: You can earn Hilton Honors points not only for stays at Hilton properties but also for dining shopping and other activities. Credit card partners like American Express and Visa also offer generous bonus points for spending on their cards.

Elite status tiers: Hilton Honors offers four elite status tiers – Silver Gold Diamond and Diamond Plus – that have increasing levels of benefits. They include room upgrades breakfast and award nights. You can earn elite status by staying at Hilton properties or achieving a certain number of points in a calendar year.

The cons of participating in Hilton Honors

Points lose value: Hilton like other hotel companies is in an almost constant process of increasing its redemption levels which devalues points. Some redemptions may offer poor value. Paying for your hotel with cash instead of points may make sense on certain stays.

Limited transfer options: There are limited opportunities to transfer your Hilton Honors points to other loyalty programs such as airlines. Also the 10:1 transfer ratio makes transfers cost-prohibitive. You are better off leaving your points in the Hilton Honors program. (Related: How did 550000 Hilton points become 55000 Delta miles? And can you undo it please?)

Loss of privacy and increase in spending: Hilton collects your personal data every time you stay in a hotel and use its loyalty program. It knows your room preference and spending patterns and it has a complete history of your hotel visits when you participate in the Hilton Honors program. Loyalty programs sometimes sell this information to third parties or it can be compromised in a data breach. And of course there is the ultimate goal of every loyalty program — to get you to spend more. I outline this in my free guide to loyalty programs.

How much are Hilton points worth?

It isn’t difficult to guess the value of a Hilton point. Giammanco used 40000 points for a room that cost $150. That makes each point worth little less than four-tenths of a cent.

Other estimates have pegged the value of a Hilton point at about half a cent. Hilton has in the past also sold points directly to customers at 0.5 cents per point.

Of course Hilton doesn’t disclose the actual value of its points. From time to time travel companies will make an oblique reference to their point valuations in an earnings report but it is never enough to hang an authoritative valuation on.

Only one thing is certain in the world of point points and miles — the value of awards is constantly declining. So 40000 points today will be worth significantly less in a year. Never stockpile your awards. They are not an investment. They lose value over time. Earn ’em and burn ’em.

How many Hilton points do I need for a “free” night?

Award nights — or “free” nights as Hilton calls them are technically available for as few as 5000 points and as many as 95000 points per night for a standard room. However for some speciality accommodations you may spend upward of 120000 points per night for a standard room. Hilton uses a dynamic system to price its rooms so the number of points required may vary depending on the hotel time of year and cost of a room.

Bear in mind that there is no such thing as a “free” night contrary to the language used by Hilton and others. You have earned points by staying in a hotel or using a credit card. If the room nights were truly “free” then anyone could claim them and not points would be required. But they are not free — it just sounds better.

How to use your Hilton points

Giammanco had the right idea. The most cost-effective use points for award nights is at a mid-priced hotel like a Hilton Garden Inn. The number of points required for an award night at a Hilton Garden Inn is often — but not always — lower than the number required for an award night at a higher-tier hotel.

But there are other ways to stretch your points. Hilton Honors members can maximize their points by using them for room upgrades or other add-ons such as breakfast or late check-out. These options require fewer points than an award night plus they can make a hotel stay more comfortable and enjoyable.

If an award night wasn’t in her future Giammanco could have also used her Hilton Honors points in conjunction with other frequent flyer programs. This is an easy way to burn through your points and fly somewhere if you need to but as I mentioned before the transfer rate is generally not advantageous to the member.

By combining points with miles travelers can often book more expensive flights or upgrades that would normally be out of reach.

By following these strategies Hilton Honors members can get the most value out of their points and enjoy even more luxurious travel experiences.

Can Hilton just keep your points?

The bigger question here is: Can Hilton keep your points?

As a matter of fact it can. Its terms and conditions are clear on that matter:

Accrued Points and Reward Certificates and Confirmations do not constitute property of the Members. Except as specifically provided herein neither accrued Points nor Reward Certificates/Confirmations are transferable for any reason or by operation of law.

In other words you do not own the points you earn. They belong to Hilton.

By the way these terms are not unique to Hilton. Almost every travel loyalty program stipulates that the points you earn do not belong to you — and can be removed from your account for any reason. Some agreements even say that the company does not owe you an explanation for removing the points.

Most travelers don’t bother to read the fine print in their agreement and believe — falsely — that they own the points they’ve worked so hard to earn. But they don’t. Almost every travel loyalty program stipulates that the points you earn do not belong to you — and can be removed from your account for any reason. Some agreements even say that the company does not owe you an explanation for removing the points. — Christopher Elliott

Giammanco wasn’t about to accept the loss of her 40000 points. She emailed me to tell me that she wanted to appeal this to someone at the executive level. I list the names numbers and email addresses of Hilton’s executives on my consumer advocacy site Elliott.org.

But Giammanco wanted a better name. “I need the higher-level contacts for the Hilton Honors program” she told me.

That would be Mark Weinstein Hilton’s chief marketing officer. Mark is extra responsive to emails and in my experience he tries to resolve any loyalty problems quickly and fairly. But instead of bothering Mark with this over a holiday weekend I thought I would try my advocacy channels so I reached out to Hilton on Giammanco’s behalf. (Read here about a bride who was billed for hotel rooms that went unused.)

Hilton “sincerely” apologizes for the missing 40000 points

Within 48 hours Giammanco had a written response — and a resolution — from Hilton.

I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused to you. Post reviewing your case file in an effort to resolve your concern. I am taking the ownership and issuing the 40000 Hilton Honors points to your account. I hope you will consider it as a commitment towards our service. Please allow us 24-48 hours to reflect these points in your Honors account.

There are a few things I like about that response. It was fast and didn’t mince words. Also it talked about “taking the ownership” of the problem — in other words not placing the blame on another department or person. Hilton was fixing the problem now in the interests of good customer service.

Smart move refunding those 40000 points. Something tells me Giammanco would have moved her business to another hotel if Hilton hadn’t done the right thing.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbG95YWx0eWxvYmJ5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzI1L2hpbHRvbnMtZ29sZC1kaWFtb25kLWJyZWFrZmFzdC1jcmVkaXQtZXhwYW5kcy10by1vbnRhcmlvLWNhbmFkYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hilton's Gold & Diamond Breakfast Credit Expands To Ontario (Canada),ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://loyaltylobby.com/2022/12/25/hiltons-gold-diamond-breakfast-credit-expands-to-ontario-canada/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbG95YWx0eWxvYmJ5LmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyLzI1L2hpbHRvbnMtZ29sZC1kaWFtb25kLWJyZWFrZmFzdC1jcmVkaXQtZXhwYW5kcy10by1vbnRhcmlvLWNhbmFkYS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9oeWF0dC1yZWdlbmN5LWpmay1hdC1yZXNvcnRzLXdvcmxkLXJldmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hyatt Regency JFK At Resorts World Review,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='viewfromthewing.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /hyatt-regency-jfk-at-resorts-world-review/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021226EACD60>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9oeWF0dC1yZWdlbmN5LWpmay1hdC1yZXNvcnRzLXdvcmxkLXJldmlldy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyaXBzYXZ2eS5jb20vYmVzdC1vY2VhbmZyb250LWhvdGVscy1pbi12aXJnaW5pYS1iZWFjaC00MTc0NzMx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 7 Best Oceanfront Virginia Beach Hotels,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyaXBzYXZ2eS5jb20vYmVzdC1vY2VhbmZyb250LWhvdGVscy1pbi12aXJnaW5pYS1iZWFjaC00MTc0NzMx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021226EADE40>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Fast forward almost a century and all this remains true – if a little clichéd by now. Yet contemporary Greece is far richer than its well-explored tropes. Athens in particular currently packs quite a punch making a strong case for a type of transcendence embodying various phases in the country’s history while providing a melting pot where fresh trends global influences and time-honed local traditions meet. ‘Athens is breaking away from an over-edited idealised antiquity-driven image’ says Nicholas Yatromanolakis the country’s Deputy Minister of Culture and Sports. ‘Everything coexists here – different styles and periods - and we need to embrace it. We also have a strong outdoors culture and you are always exposed to a very layered urban spaceit is its blend that makes Athens unique.’

Fresh takes on classic Athenian moments mixed with entirely new offerings represent an ever-evolving contemporary Greek identity that is much less about looking back and more about a positive future for the Mediterranean country. There is a reimagining of some of the city’s finest modernist architecture; a boom in the hospitality industry; a move towards sustainability; and a wave of new cultural destinations. Creativity is running high and Athens is on an upward trajectory following a ten-year period of economic woes political changes and of course the troubles brought by the worldwide pandemic all of which hit the city hard. Yet here we are and the Greek capital seems to be heading towards sunnier times.

The former Athens Hilton

The former Hilton Athens one of the city’s most recognisable 20th-century buildings represents this well. Originally built between 1958 and 1963 during that era of optimism and growth and designed by Greek modernists Emmanuel Vourekas Prokopis Vasileiadis and Spyro Staikos it features site-specific reliefs by celebrated local artist Yannis Moralis the largest swimming pool in the city and was its first international brand hotel – no wonder guests have included Aristotle Onassis and Frank Sinatra. It came to be such a landmark that the whole neighbourhood around it took its name. But the noughties found it in need of a refresh and it was bought by Greek developer Ionian Hotel Enterprises (IHE) (TEMES the powerhouse that owns the popular and ever-growing Costa Navarino resort complex in the Peloponnese holds a controlling stake in IHE). Now it is being brought into the 21st century with a brand new concept for a luxury hotel and private residences to be developed by Hilton and IHE in partnership with Conrad Hotels & Resorts Conrad Residences and Waldorf Astoria Residences. The team behind it including studios such as AETER Architects Charry C Bougadelis & Associates Tristan Auer and AvroKO aims to offer an unprecedented lifestyle destination for the city with a members club multiple culinary entertaining leisure and wellness options as well as a brand new poolside pavilion restaurant by Yabu Pushelberg. Construction is ongoing and the first guests should arrive in 2024.

The National Museum of Contemporary Art Αthens (EMST)

The former Hilton is not the only modernist jewel in Athens’ crown to be given a new lease of life. One of the city’s most notable cultural draws the National Museum of Contemporary Art Αthens (EMST) launched its new home in 2020 – although the ensuing pandemic closures meant it wasn’t fully accessible until June 2022. It is now located in the transformed ruin of the former Fix brewery. Created in 1963 by Greek modernist Takis Zenetos – and dubbed by locals the ‘horizontal skyscraper’ for its elegant lines but also its sheer scale – the building is now a modern art space thanks to a revamp by 3SK Stylianidis Architects in collaboration with Kalliope Kontozoglou I Mouzakis & Associates-Architects and Tim Ronalds Architects. The space feels fresh and beautifully fit for purpose – if perhaps a little too removed from its previous life (the building’s past doesn’t come through particularly strongly – and 40 per cent of it was demolished to make way for the local metro to considerable controversy before it was reassigned as an art space). Still it’s a significant arts hub for Athens and its artistic director Katerina Gregos appointed last year promises a new era for its displays too.

Piraeus Tower and more by the port and Syngrou Avenue

Meanwhile the long-abandoned modern ruin of the 1972 Piraeus Tower the second tallest in Greece is currently being reimagined as a mixed-use scheme aimed at redefining the busy yet somewhat architecturally neglected port district of Piraeus. The developer behind it Athens based Dimand is one of the city’s most design-led players in real estate. The project’s special new façade is by young studio PILA (local studio Betaplan acted as the lead architect for the overall scheme) founded by architect Ilias Papageorgiou who left a partner position at New York’s SO-IL in 2019 to return to Athens and set up shop on his own. ‘After ten years of a harsh economic crisis Greece is undergoing a rapid transformation on many fronts’ he says. ‘This building is situated on a really important part of the wider city of Athens. We see the “awakening” of the abandoned structure of the Tower as sparking a broader regeneration allowing for the life of the city to move closer to the water.’ Dimand COO Olga Itsiou adds ‘The Piraeus Tower was an unfinished building a sleeping giant for more than 40 years. It has never operated except for minimal commercial uses on the ground and first two floors. It was not filled with people. [Now] offices shops a gym an all-day restaurant and a café will enable approximately 2000 people to work there.’

The tower’s transformation into sleek offices and retail space also includes public landscaping which will reframe the port’s pedestrian access and circulation via a new green footbridge. Sustainability has been a big part of the plan too as the team ensured a range of eco-friendly strategies are used such as its louvres which reduce solar gain on the façade by 45 per cent; the use of photovoltaic panels; and the recycling of more than 5000 sq m of glass during construction a proportion of which will be installed as new glass in the project.

Similar themes around community and sustainability are found in more Dimand projects. Some of the company’s assets in the nearby Agios Dionysios neighbourhood (also known as Papastratos from the namesake tobacco brand that had its factory here in the last century) include office spaces that breathe new life into the area coinciding with the arrival of neighbours that created a new international art district Galleries Rodeo Carwan and The Intermission have made Agios Dionysios their home reviving the formerly neglected industrial area.

Further up Syngrou Avenue towards the city centre a new office hub by Athens- and London-based Divercity Architects and Bennetts Associates for Dimand is hailed as one of the city’s most eco-friendly workspaces matching elegant design and minimalist looks with LEED Gold targeting green credentials – including the use of recycled or local materials and careful shading and view-framing strategies - to promote health and wellbeing. ‘Having had the time to reflect on the lessons the last couple of years have taught us the city feels more extrovert more dynamic and more creative than ever and it is infectious’ says one of Divercity’s founders Nikolas Travasaros. ‘Projects of all scales are on the rise. It is a great place to be for architecture studios with the city shaping and reinventing itself into a more contemporary capital.’

The former Ellinikon airport

Athens also plays host to one of the largest redevelopment sites in the country (and at 6200000 sq m probably the whole of Europe) – the former Ellinikon airport which is being reinvented as a vast mixed-use neighbourhood by owners Lamda Development. The substantial site will feature the city’s largest public park (by Sasaki Associates in collaboration with Greek architecture firm Doxiadis+); a selection of designs by local and international architects such as Foster + Partners Kengo Kuma & Associates and Aedas; and a restored piece of global architectural history – Eero Saarinen’s East Terminal (built in the 1960s) which has remained largely unused since the transport hub officially transferred to the current Eleftherios Venizelos airport in 2004 in time for the Athens Olympic Games. While the project is quite far off from completion some elements such as Foster + Partners’ Marina Tower are underway. A recently opened visitor hub The Ellinikon Experience Centre in a reimagined aircraft hangar on site gives a taste of what’s to come. Skyscrapers greenery and mixed-use seaside neighbourhoods dubbed by the developers ‘the Athens Riviera’ showcase how the city might change – quite drastically so too given the distinct absence of ultra high rise buildings in the whole of Greece.

Modern Athens hospitality

More opportunities for reinvention are available more centrally too as the high-profile competition for the redevelopment of the National Archaeology museum is currently underway – one of the many opportunities for architects in the country says Xristina Argyros co-founder of London-based studio Neiheiser Argyros which recently established a second base in Athens. ‘There is a range of exciting projects happening in Greece and overall more opportunities than before for younger practices to participate. We have noticed a larger number of public competitions but also many project initiatives by developers such as Dimand and Intracom that value the newer ideas and sensibilities that younger emerging practices are putting on the table.’.

This upsurge in cultural activity has inevitably brought an influx of hospitality venues. Hotels of all shapes and sizes have been popping up across town. Ksenodoxeio Milos is among them a grand luxurious contemporary space designed by Divercity Architects. Its restaurant Estiatorio Milos serves some of the best fish in Athens – having relocated from its former spot in the Hilton to its new home a stone’s throw from Syntagma Square. Established venues such as Milos are juxtaposed with smaller boutique outfits such as the art-filled live-like-an-Athenian mini hotel M18 by Oliaros at the foot of the Acropolis; and Mona – an industrial-space-cum-experimental-hotel members club and event venue that also showcases as part of its concept a range of independent Greek designers and artists of all disciplines in the trendy Psirri neighbourhood.

Gagosian Athens

Such is Athens’ pull that international art dynamo Gagosian has bolstered its presence here with a new home in 2020 designed by Kois Associated Architects in the upmarket Kolonaki district. One of its recent exhibitions celebrated the country’s cultural influence through the work of legendary designer Marc Newson. The show presents new limited-edition furniture including some of Newson’s most celebrated works – presented in Greece's national colours of blue and white. ‘Greece is a country that is close to my heart my grandfather was from there. I have spent every summer there for the last 24 years’ says Newson. He talks about the country’s enduring creative influence on his work. ‘It has always been in my consciousness I draw probably more inspiration from it than I know. I was one of the first people working with marble in a contemporary way 25 years ago. I am trying to champion Greek manufacturers and skills that may be now dying – there is this wonderful expertise there. I always wanted to do something in Greece and the time was right now with Gagosian. Athens is an exciting contemporary destination. I am already thinking of the next thing I do there.’

Curator and researcher Katerina Papanikolopoulos feels that attraction towards the local cultural heritage too. The Greek-Cypriot-American creative moved from the US to Athens in 2020 and set up the non-profit Athens Design Forum cultural festival. In many ways it is still in its infancy – only two editions in it previously focused on architecture and art with a third iteration turning its attention to film craft and labour currently in development. The annual event aims to celebrate and explore the different dimensions of design thinking in Athens and the country beyond. Papanikolopoulos hopes to shine a light on Greek vernacular crafts look at intersections of old and new practices and discover design beyond the beaten track in all its forms. Examples of her approach include celebrating the rarely seen Kypseli house which she opened to the public for ADF’s inaugural event thereby highlighting the work of lesser-known Greek modernist Aristomenis Provelengios.

Nikos Vatopoulous – art editor of the major national broadsheet Kathimerini author of the book Walking in Athens and self-appointed flaneur – has written extensively about the capital’s layered identity and especially its lesser known ‘everyday’ architectural gems as opposed to the well-documented monuments. ‘You get crumbling houses juxtaposed with modern concrete buildings all eras next to each other at once’ he has said referring to Athens’ ‘secret landscape.’ And it’s just that the city’s evolving multi-layered urbanscape that is shining dynamically through today's Athens – fuelling its cultural rise and possibly where its strength may lie. ‘Athens caters for very different tastes and experiences’ concludes Deputy Minister of Culture and Sports Yatromanolakis. ‘And we have a vision to do more – showcase Greek crafts more create space for artists and grassroots activity explore less travelled paths of Greek culture. We also want to invest in developing artists' skills and enrich cultural experiences across all fields.’

Governor Roy Cooper is calling on Duke Energy to provide more information about the utility company's decision to implement rolling outages this past weekend during some of the coldest Christmas holiday weather in decades.

In a tweet Monday morning Cooper wrote: ""Duke Energy assures me NC is in the clear now. But I'm deeply concerned about people who lost power and who didn't get notice about rotating outages. Grateful for those who conserved energy. I've asked Duke for a complete report on what went wrong for changes to be made.""

""When we made the difficult decision to take these temporary outages they were done in a fairly fast order. So that work happened at a pace that didn't allow us to be as proactive in our communications as we'd typically be on other types of planned outages. This was sort of an emergent event. So I would say we did not get to communicate as well as we would like to with customers on the front end but we did try to provide information when we could during the event. And I think there's opportunities for us there to go back and look at that and see are there other things that we can do going forward to help improve that process just as will look at this entire event to figure out what things can be added to our plans and our processes to help either avoid this in the future or to improve that process"" said Duke Energy spokesperson Jeff Brooks.

Duke Energy e-mailed customers Monday afternoon shedding more light on the decision to institute outages.

Heavy rains in the Triangle Thursday saturated the ground ahead of high winds Friday which let to knocked over trees and branches causing power outages. During that time temperatures dropped leading to higher energy usage. Since other areas of the country were also experiencing high usage rates Duke Energy was unable to import power from elsewhere leading them to institute rolling outages.

""They help to protect the grid from a potentially larger and uncontrolled outage that could potentially happen if you don't manage the grid properly"" said Brooks.

The bulk of outages related to the storm were addressed by Saturday with Duke Energy sharing Monday there was no further need for rotating outages. Brooks explained the process of how specific areas are identified for such outages.

""We look for where we have pockets of electricity that we can pull from and then where do we have gaps that we need it"" Brooks said.

Duke Energy used solar energy which played a role in aiding power generation Friday during the initial wave of outages.

""We are in a time of transition. There's a lot of things like battery storage coming online very fast. But we're talking about a big system that's been built over decades if not approaching a century at this point. So it's going to take time to transition. The climate's changing how we use power is changing"" said Dr. Christopher Galik a Public Administration Professor at NC State.

Galik explained utility companies are focusing on diverse energy sources including renewables.

""We had a paper actually on this just recently where we were doing some research into better planning for what's called 'winter-peaking.' It's when you have your peak events your greatest energy consumption in the winter as opposed to when it's really hot on a summer afternoon. This is all changing too. So I think it's a matter of not only looking at these other generational sources but also trying to do a better job planning from local to federal in how to make everything work together"" Galik said.

He added customers can also play a role in reducing their own energy usage.

""Something as simple as weatherization I think is really important. Simply putting more insulation or sealing gaps"" said Galik.

North Carolina's Electric Cooperatives suggested temporary measures such as delaying the use of large appliances like dishwashers and dryers lowering your thermostat by a few degrees and turning off unnecessary lights can also reduce usage rates.

Shoppers stopped by Triangle home improvement stores both in anticipation of this recent weather stretch and in response as they prepare this winter.

""With the power outages over the past few week we have seen a high uptick in generators"" noted French Ratliff Store Manager of The Home Depot in Knightdale.

""Whenever we get a cold spell storm's coming through we always see people coming in for general things to stay warm so generators are one of our biggest asks any sort of heater-device"" added Brandon Dazarm a Department Supervisor with the Lowe's in West Raleigh.

That includes honing in on outside energy sources and efficiency.

""We make sure that we have fire pits gas-powered wood-powered we have wood to burn as well"" Ratliff said.

""They want to keep as little heat as escaping as possible so what they can do to lower the heating bill electric bill especially in today's day and age"" Dazarm added.

What are rolling blackouts?

Turbulent 2022 Supply chain disruptions economic uncertainty IT industry layoffs cybersecurity threats and multi-billion-dollar acquisitions. As the year draws to a close here’s a look at what have been the biggest news stories so far in the IT industry and the channel in 2022. COVID-19 itself may have faded as a top story. But several of the top news stories this year stem from the ongoing repercussions of the global pandemic and its impact on the economy the IT industry and the channel. Continued supply chain disruptions for example were a major challenge for the industry. Shortages of semiconductors components and finished systems have left IT vendors and solution providers scrambling to meet their customers’ needs. And with IT products needed to run on-premises data centers sometimes unavailable for weeks or months some see the supply chain problem accelerating the adoption of cloud services. Economic uncertainty kept many IT and channel executives awake at night as they watch for any signs of slowing sales or customer pullback. Many IT companies from giants like Intel Cisco Systems and HP Inc. to startups and solution providers initiated cost-cutting efforts and laid off employees. And in a major shift in how businesses operate the work-from-home and hybrid work practices imposed by the pandemic on millions of workers now appear to be at least semi-permanent. And that means changes – and opportunities – in the IT products and services the channel provides. Some of this year’s biggest news stories involve blockbuster acquisitions that are changing the face of the IT industry and the channel. Some like AMD’s $49 billion buy of Xilinx – the largest acquisition in the history of the semiconductor industry – are done deals. Others like Broadcom’s pending $61 billion deal to buy virtualization giant VMware are in the works. The ongoing threat of malware ransomware and other cyberattacks against businesses government agencies and IT companies remains a major story with managed service providers a frequent target. Changes in Microsoft’s channel program and practices and their impact on partners have made headlines this year. And how the IT industry has responded to the war in Ukraine rounds out the top stories. Here’s our look at the top 10 news stories of 2022 starting with No. 10 and counting down to No. 1. Take a look and see if you agree with our choices.

No. 9: AMD Completes $49 Billion Xilinx Buy In Semiconductor Industry’s Biggest Acquisition On February 14 chipmaker AMD completed its acquisition of Xilinx allowing AMD to expand beyond its core CPU and GPU product lineup to add reprogrammable chips called field programmable gate arrays to its technology portfolio. The acquisition is already paying off: In August AMD reported that Xilinx revenue accounted for 51 percent of its $6.55 billion in revenue in its second quarter. Going forward the acquisition is expected to significantly expand AMD’s opportunities in data centers embedded computing and telecommunications. Xilinx also had a presence in other markets including defense broadcast and consumer electronics. Altogether the acquisition grew AMD’s total addressable market to $135 billion from $80 billion according to the company. The cost of the all-stock acquisition deal was originally $35 billion when it was announced in October 2020. But the double-digit growth of AMD’s share price since then boosted the deal’s final price tag to $49 billion – the largest acquisition deal in the history of the semiconductor industry. AMD’s successful Xilinx acquisition was in contrast to the failed effort by rival Nvidia to acquire British chip designer Arm for $40 billion. Nvidia abandoned that deal in February in the face of regulatory opposition. Intel meanwhile has taken steps in 2022 to aggressively expand its chip manufacturing capacity including striking a deal in February to buy Israeli chipmaker Tower Semiconductor for $5.4 billion. Tower operates a network of chip manufacturing plants that Intel said will significantly advance its plan to manufacture chips for other companies through Intel Foundry Services.

No. 8: Hybrid Work/Work-From-Home Is Here To Stay On Aug. 29 HP Inc. completed its blockbuster $3.3 billion acquisition of Poly a provider of videoconferencing equipment cameras headsets and other audio peripherals. The big idea? Combining Poly’s product line with HP’s own portfolio of desktop and laptop PCs printers and other accessories will make HP the go-to vendor for supporting hybrid work models and work-from-home employees. “The rise of the hybrid office creates a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine the way work gets done” said HP CEO Enrique Lores in a statement extolling the HP-Poly match. “Combining HP and Poly creates a leading portfolio of hybrid work solutions across large and growing markets.” When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in early 2020 millions of office workers were confined to their homes. That created a huge surge in demand for laptop and desktop PCs collaboration applications videoconferencing services and other products that solution providers scrambled to provide. Most everyone assumed that work-at-home would be temporary. But the pandemic lasted far longer than many expected and – surprise – many workers discovered they preferred working from home. While offices have reopened around the nation many businesses and organizations have adopted a hybrid work model where employees split their time between their home office and “The Office.” In June HP released the results of a survey of 1000 office workers in the U.S. and Canada that found that 68 percent of employees expect to work from home at least three days a week. “The digitalization trend continues to accelerate and the hybrid work model is here to stay” said Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing during an earnings call in August. The hybrid work model is creating opportunities for solution providers as well as vendors. NWN Carousel debuted its Hybrid Work Suite in January followed in April with the consumption-based At-Home Essentials and Office Collaboration Room-as-a-Service kits. “During the pandemic we saw organizations in triage mode of sustaining business with work at home” NWN Carousel Chief Marketing Officer Andrew Gilman told CRN. “Now hybrid work is real and customers are looking at how do they make hybrid work actually work. It is no longer about swiping a credit card and getting by. It is about the employee experience being consistent whether you are working at home or coming to the office. It has to be consistent frictionless and something that actually works and is sustainable.” In October Cisco Systems addressed the next stage of hybrid work by adding more security and manageability capabilities into its popular Webex platform. “Cisco is all-in on hybrid work” said Jeetu Patel Cisco’s executive vice president and general manager of security and collaboration at the WebexOne event. Also in October Cisco partner Aqueduct Technologies said 2022 was shaping up to be a record year with the move to hybrid work generating demand for its networking collaboration solutions. And in an interview with CRN in November Todd Surdey Zoom’s new channel chief touted the opportunities for partners created by the “hybrid world.” Some businesses and their CEOs have taken steps to attempt to force workers back to the office – one such battle at AT&T received a lot of attention. But in a LinkedIn post on Sept. 7 none other than Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell chided his fellow CEOs for that approach. “From my experience if you are counting on forced hours spent in a traditional office to create collaboration and provide a feeling of belonging within your organization you’re doing it wrong” Dell said.

No. 7: Google Buys Incident Response Superstar Mandiant For $5.4 Billion The security segment of the IT industry has seen a lot of merger and acquisition activity this year including Cloudflare’s $162 million acquisition of Area 1 Security and Ping Identity’s deal to be taken private by Thoma Bravo for $2.8 billion. But perhaps the most notable acquisition in IT security this year was Google’s acquisition of incident response technology developer Mandiant for $5.4 billion in what observers see as a move to compete with Microsoft and Amazon Web Services. (Microsoft reportedly was considering a bid to buy Mandiant before Google’s deal.) Google completed the Mandiant acquisition in September with Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian saying his company planned to “reinvent security” for customers through the move. Acquiring Mandiant significantly expands Google’s cybersecurity capabilities in real-time threat intelligence and incident response. The deal came just four months after Mandiant sold its network endpoint and email security product business to Symphony Technology Group for $1.2 billion. In October Jeff Reed vice president of product for Google Cloud Security told CRN that integrating and developing synergies between the Google Cloud and Mandiant technology portfolios was well underway to provide “unprecedented” threat intelligence capabilities to customers and partners. In October Google Cloud said it would inject Mandiant technology into its Chronicle cloud-native security service and create “billions of dollars” in new opportunities for the channel.

No. 6: Microsoft Partners Wrestle With Channel Program Requirements Management Changes It’s been a turbulent 2022 for many of Microsoft’s 400000 channel partners as the software giant makes some of the biggest changes to its partner program since the Microsoft Certified Solution Provider program launched 30 years ago. At the heart of the controversial changes is Microsoft’s New Commerce Experience (NCE) which sets the rules for how customers buy and renew commercial software subscriptions through partners. Microsoft began enforcing NCE requirements for new deals in March. Some partners have struggled to adapt to the myriad of NCE changes which impose stringent software licensing requirements and an accompanying 20 percent premium on monthly commitments for popular Microsoft software packages. Partners say the changes force them to renegotiate terms with customers and pushes partners and customers into annual subscription commitments instead of monthly ones. The software giant has also repeatedly delayed the timeline for moving legacy subscriptions to NCE. Partner Capability Scores another major change to the partner program set to start in October will be used to determine who qualifies as a Microsoft solution provider. That has some partners scrambling to figure out how they can earn enough points to maintain their partner status under the new program. In March partners launched an online petition disapproving of the program changes calling the new scoring requirements “impossible” to meet. A CRN poll of 160 Microsoft partners conducted midyear found that 27 percent were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with NCE the new partner requirements and the changes in partner requirements. An equal number were more dissatisfied or significantly more dissatisfied with Microsoft as a partner than one year before. During a fourth fiscal quarter earnings call in July Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said “partner transition work” had a negative effect on sales growth among small and midsize business customers including for paid Office 365 commercial seats the Enterprise Mobility + Security business and Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue. In late August Microsoft even came under fire from cloud rivals Amazon Web Services and Google who said that changes to Microsoft’s Services provider Licensing agreements were anti-competitive and would lock customers into Microsoft’s cloud. Microsoft recently announced program policy changes around outsourced infrastructure hosting after the company’s software licensing policies stirred controversy in Europe. The changes continued into September with the announcement of a 16.7 percent discount promotion for new and upgrading Microsoft 365 customers a new Teams Rooms Pro offer and changes to the Partner Center user interface. On Dec. 20 Microsoft said it would go forward with plans to end legacy partner incentives for certain products sold under the pre-NCE way of transacting licenses and services from the software giant. Microsoft’s channel leadership itself has undergone significant changes. Rodney Clark Microsoft’s channel chief for more than a year left the company in May. His duties were split between David Smith vice president of channel sales and Julie Sanford vice president of go-to-market programs and experiences. Nicole Dezen is chief partner officer and corporate vice president of the Global Partner Solutions organization. In October Microsoft hired Nina Harding previously Google Cloud’s chief of global partner strategy and programs to become Microsoft’s new corporate vice president for global partner solutions in the U.S.

No. 4: Kaseya’s $6.2 Billion Acquisition Of Rival Datto Kaseya a developer of IT management tools used by businesses and managed service providers shook up the MSP space on April 11 when it announced an all-cash deal to acquire rival Datto for $6.2 billion. The acquisition was officially completed on June 23. Combining two of the biggest MSP-focused platform providers was expected to put competitive heat on rivals ConnectWise and N-able in such areas as remote monitoring and management security and professional services. Kaseya CEO Fred Voccola touted the acquisition as providing its global customers with “more functional innovative and integrated solutions.” Datto CEO Tim Weller said the deal “brings together a broader array of technology products to create additional opportunities for MSPs.” But the acquisition has been controversial with concerns about the impact on Datto employees and that company’s MSP-focused culture. A frowny-face emoji reaction to the deal posted three days after the announcement ignited a social media firestorm that included vitriolic comments berating Kaseya. In an interview with CRN two weeks after the acquisition deal was announced Voccola tried to assuage the fears and criticisms saying Kaseya was firmly committed to investing in Datto’s strong channel culture product set and brand and said there were no plans to shutter any Datto offices. “We’re spending $6.2 billion to buy an awesome company” Voccola said. “We don’t buy companies to gut them for profit. Every acquisition we’ve done we’ve doubled or tripled or in some cases quintupled the amount of investment in the products and support in the business. We’re not buying Datto to destroy it. We’re buying Datto because we want to get better at that and Datto is the best so we buy the best.” At Kaseya’s ConnectIT conference the week the acquisition closed Voccola sought to reassure Datto employees partners and customers and provided more details about Datto management changes – including the departure of CEO Tim Weller – and plans for combining the Kaseya and Datto technology portfolios. “It’s our job to make sure that we build the best freaking platform for our customers because they rely on us to make sure it’s complete” he said. But closing the deal didn’t end the controversies. Datto founder and former CEO Austin McChord posted a blistering diatribe on GitHub and LinkedIn in July saying that post-acquisition changes were destroying the Datto Culture. (Kaseya CFO Kathy Wagner later issued a statement disputing McChord’s comments.) The ramifications of the acquisition continued into late 2022. In October Rob Rae who as senior vice president of business development was the face of that company for solution providers left Kaseya. Earlier this month CRN reported that Ryan Weeks Datto’s well-regarded chief information security officer was no longer in that role.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWx3YXktdGVjaG5vbG9neS5jb20vbmV3cy9zaWVtZW5zLWluZGlhLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmctZWxlY3RyaWMtbG9jb21vdGl2ZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Siemens India wins manufacturing contract for electric locomotives,"Siemens plans to deliver prototype locomotives in the coming two years.

Siemens which will serve as a technological partner will maintain these locomotives at four depots located in Vishakhapatnam Raipur Kharagpur and Pune.

Indian Railways plans to use the HP locomotives on Western DFC as well as on graded sections of Railways for hauling container freight trains in double stack configuration of 4500t at 75 kmph at 1 in 200 gradient.

These locomotives are expected to have an average speed of around 50-60 kmph over the existing 20-25 kmph.

They will feature insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) based propulsion technology which will enable savings in energy consumption due to regenerative braking technology.

Siemens India has been selected through a competitive bidding process for manufacturing and maintaining these locomotives using Railway staff under the technology partner supervision.

Last month Siemens launched a new production facility for rail bogies at Aurangabad in the Indian state of Maharashtra.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL2xlZ2VuZGFyeS10dW5pbmctc2hvcHMtamFwYW5lc2UtYXV0by10dW5pbmctc2NlbmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Most Legendary Tuning Shops In The Japanese Auto Tuning Scene,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.hotcars.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /legendary-tuning-shops-japanese-auto-tuning-scene/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000212273DC640>, 'Connection to www.hotcars.com timed out.

Since national signing day on Wednesday Sanders and the Buffs have added 31 players including 15 transfers. In the coming months the Buffs are sure to add more as they re-shape the roster and that means there are more players from the 2022 roster likely to move along.

While there are sure to be many changes coming here’s a look at how the roster is shaping up for now. This list only includes scholarship players. As of now CU has 86 players slated to be on scholarship as far as what’s known publicly.

Quarterbacks (5)

Returners: JT Shrout Sr.; Drew Carter So.

Newcomers: Shedeur Sanders Jr.; Ryan Staub Fr.; Kasen Weisman Fr.

Note: Sanders a two-year starter at Jackson State and the son of the head coach is sure to take over as the starter. Shrout started seven games this season for the Buffs and could be a key backup if he stays.

Running backs (5)

Returners: Deion Smith Sr.; Jayle Stacks Jr.; Anthony Hankerson So.; Victor Venn Fr.

Newcomers: Dylan Edwards Fr.

Note: For now Smith and Hankerson are the top two in terms of experience. Both had good moments this season as did Stacks when called upon. Edwards is a four-star recruit however and has the ability to compete for the top job.

Wide receivers (13)

Returners: Maurice Bell Sr.; Montana Lemonious-Craig Jr.; Ty Robinson Jr.; Jordyn Tyson So.; Grant Page Fr.; Chase Sowell Fr.

Newcomers: Jimmy Horn Jr. Jr.; Isaiah Hardge Fr.; Adam Hopkins Fr.; Omarion Miller Fr.; Jordan Onovughe Fr.; Jacob Page Fr.; Asaad Waseem Fr.

Note: Tyson was dynamic this season but faces a long offseason of injury rehab. Lemonious-Craig had a productive season as well. Bell would need a medical hardship waiver to return. Coach Sanders has made this a high priority and Horn was a huge addition. He could be the top receiver. Transfer cornerback Travis Hunter is also expected to play receiver.

Tight ends (6)

Returners: Caleb Fauria So.; Erik Olsen So.; Louis Passarello So.; Austin Smith So.; Zach Courtney Fr.

Newcomers: Seydou Traore Jr.

Note: With Brady Russell graduating there isn’t much experience coming back. Traore could slide in as the top target. He was first-team All-Sun Belt at Arkansas State this year. Fauria and Olsen showed great potential this season.

Offensive linemen (14)

Returners: Gerad Christian-Lichtenhan Jr.; Alex Harkey Jr.; Jake Wiley Jr.; Jackson Anderson So.; Lucas Eckardt So.; Van Wells So.; Carter Edwards Fr.; Travis Gray Fr.

Newcomers: Landon Bebee Sr.; Isaiah Jatta Jr.; Tyler Brown So.; Savion Washington So.; Jack Wilty So.; Hank Zalinskas Fr.

Note: Three starters – Christian-Lichtenhan Wiley and Wells – are slated to return but Sanders loaded up on transfers. Jatta was a JUCO All-American Brown was an FCS All-American Bebee and Wilty earned all-conference honors and Washington was a full-time starter at Kent State. There will be plenty of competition in the trenches.

Defensive linemen (9)

Returners: Jalen Sami Sr.; Na’im Rodman Sr.; Allan Baugh So.; Tyas Martin So.; Ryan Williams So.; Aaron Austin So.

Newcomers: Taijh Alston Sr.; Shane Cokes Jr.; Marshawn Kneeland Jr.

Note: Sami and Rodman were full-time starters this season but they’ll be fighting for starting jobs if they stay with the Buffs. Alston (West Virginia) Cokes (Dartmouth) and Kneeland (Western Michigan) were all brought in as experienced starters to beef up the Buffs on the D-line.

Edge rushers (6)

Returners: Joshka Gustav Jr.; Devin Grant So.; Zion Magalei So.; Shakaun Bowser Fr.; Kaden Ludwick Fr.

Newcomers: Taje McCoy Fr.

Note: The least experienced group on the team as it stands now. Grant and Gustav have played a combined 35 games but not as full-time starters. Both have been role players – and Gustav missed all of the 2022 season with injury. McCoy is the only addition so far but there could be more on the way.

Inside linebackers (9)

Returners: Marvin Ham II Jr.; Isaac Hurtado Jr.; Mister Williams So.; Eoghan Kerry So.; Aubrey Smith So..

Newcomers: LaVonta Bentley Jr.; Victory Johnson Fr.; Morgan Pearson Fr.; Kofi-Taylor-Barrocks Fr.

Note: The Buffs lost their top three linebackers to graduation. Bentley a transfer from Clemson could stop in as a Day 1 starter. Beyond that it’s a lot of potential. Ham Hurtado and Williams have played well at times in limited roles. Kerry and Smith have a lot of upside along with the new freshmen.

Cornerbacks (8)

Returners: Nigel Bethel Jr. Sr.; Toren Pittman Jr.; Nikko Reed Jr.; Jason Oliver So.; Keyshon Mills Fr.; Joshua Wiggins Fr.

Newcomers: Travis Hunter So.; Carter Stoutmire Fr.

Note: Hunter a transfer from Jackson State is an instant starter. He was the top recruit in the country a year ago and the top transfer this year. Reed was a full-time starter this year and played well. He would currently be penciled in as a starter.

Safeties (9)

Returners: Jeremy Mack Jr. Jr.; Tyrin Taylor Jr.; Trevor Woods Jr.; Simeon Harris So.; Dylan Dixson Fr.; Oakie Salave’a Fr.; Xavier Smith Fr..

Newcomers: Cam’Ron Silmon-Craig Jr.; Jaden Milliner-Jones Fr.

Note: The Buffs are slated to return a lot of experience. Taylor and Woods were full-time starters this year while Mack and Harris played a lot of snaps. Silmon-Craig is likely to fill one starting role though. He played for two seasons at Jackson State for Sanders.

Specialists (2)

Returners: Cole Becker Jr.

Newcomers: Mark Vassett Jr.

Note: The Buffs appear to be in great shape with the kicking game. Becker is one of the best kickers in the Pac-12 and was exceptional this season for the Buffs. Vassett committed to CU on Monday. He’s been one of the best punters in the ACC and leaves Louisville as the program’s all-time leader in single-season and career punting averages.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNwYXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9hcnRzLzIwMjIvMTIvMjUvY29sdW1idXMtbWFpbi1saWJyYXJ5LWJyYW5jaC1oYXMtYXJ0LWhvbGlkYXktdHJhaW4tb3RoZXItYXR0cmFjdGlvbnMvNjk3MzUxNzIwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Columbus main library branch has art holiday train other attractions,"Nancy Gilson

Special to The Columbus Dispatch

The Columbus Metropolitan Library is more than books – something that’s apparent every day but especially at the holidays.

The main library located Downtown is in festive shape with a Christmas tree made of books a merry diorama of woodland creatures and the Huntington Holiday Train – celebrating its 30th anniversary – all on display in the lobby.

About the Huntington Holiday Train

The train was built in 1992 by Paul Busse who also designed the Garden Railway at Franklin Park Conservatory and Botanical Gardens. The original home of the Holiday Train was the Huntington Bank Downtown.

Since 2009 the train has been shown during the holidays at the library with the exception of the library’s 2015 renovation year and the 2020 year of the COVID-19 pandemic.

At the library the train covers more than 600 square feet has more than 280 feet of train track 50 pounds of “snow” and multiple trains traveling through the layers of the exhibit.

Busse designed the buildings after real churches homes and stores in Bavarian towns in Germany and constructed them all of natural materials including bark leaves seeds pinecones and moss. There’s a castle a cathedral and a waterfall. He created miniature townspeople vendors and children who gather and watch the trains pass by.

At the library’s holiday open house earlier this month the more than 4000 people attending enjoyed this year’s version of the train.

“It’s assembled a little different every year and it’s magic every year” said Ben Zenitsky media specialist for the library.

Charming 'Weasel Burrow' still a big hit

When my adult daughters were little one of our holiday traditions was visiting “Weasel Burrow” at the main library. Created in 1990 by design students at Columbus College of Art & Design the charming diorama has stood the test of time.

The detailed glass-encased scene this year is located on the first floor in the children’s area of the library. Throughout the clever landscape anthropomorphic critters – turtles squirrels rabbits mice birds beavers and of course weasels – celebrate Christmas.

In their underground house little forest creatures gather near a Christmas tree and a fireplace mice toddlers sleep in a cozy bedroom a mama squirrel tends to dinner at the stove a toad takes a bath and a little bunny wanders around in pink bunny slippers.

Above ground a group of turtles and rabbits sing carols a chipmunk skates on an icy pond and a big beaver seems stuck trying to get out of a tree hole. The whole scene is a delight with unending characters to look at.

More art at the library

While the holiday attractions continue only through Jan. 8 many more art works can be found year-round at the Main Library and 22 branch libraries.

Through Ohio’s Percent for Art program in new and renovated buildings and the library system’s own portion of renovation budgets dedicated to art works many paintings sculptures photographs and works in other mediums are displayed.

Among these at the main library is Aminah Brenda Lynn Robinson’s colorful “Sellsville & Blackberry Patch” mural ascending the lobby staircase; Todd Slaughter’s suspended sculpture “Vanitas” in the atrium; Virginia Overton’s outdoor sculptures on the east plaza made from marble salvaged from the library’s 2015-16 renovation; Ann Hamilton’s ink jet prints “book weight” located near bookshelves and much more. These attractive and stimulating works of art add a visual dimension to the powerful media force of the library.

Dropping your kid off at college has long been a milestone for parents just as much as their teens. But is getting a degree going the way of bell bottoms cable television and calling someone on the phone?

With a strong economy and an excess of jobs with few workers to take them big companies like Google IBM and Delta Air Lines have eased up on educational requirements in an effort to find hires based on skills and experience instead.

With a four-year degree perhaps seemingly not as crucial for Americans climbing the career ladder as it once was — young people might be rethinking the need for higher education as well.

“It's a bit [like] musical chairs right now” says Alicia Modestino an associate professor and labor economist at Northeastern University. “We're seeing a lot of people shift jobs move up in the labor market. That’s great.”

However she warns that with the Fed raising interest rates in an effort to quell inflation Americans need to be prepared for the job market to slow in the coming months.

“Pretty soon the music's going to stop — so you want to have someplace to land that's going to be good for the long term.”

Employers responding to tight labor market

The tech industry in particular has been struggling with a talent shortage since pre-pandemic times.

Google and 150 other companies use the tech giant’s online college-alternative program to train and hire entry-level workers reports The Wall Street Journal. And according to CNBC IBM doesn’t ask for a bachelor’s degree for half of its U.S. roles.

Bank of America also doesn’t request college degrees for most of its entry-level jobs while Delta says degrees for pilot applicants are “preferred” but not required.

And applicants for thousands of government jobs in the state of Maryland no longer need a bachelor’s degree — instead they can submit any relevant work experience military training or other educational certificates.

This shift arrives during a thriving labor market with low unemployment and high job vacancies. And although there’s been talk of that coming to an end the Labor Department’s latest jobs report indicated that hiring slowed only slightly in November with 263000 jobs added last month compared to 284000 jobs in October.

Story continues

Modestino adds there’s precedent for this approach. During the Great Recession employers responded by focusing on skill requirements in addition to educational requirements since there were more college-educated workers available to them.

It may not be an actual ‘culture shift’

So should parents stop putting cash away for their kids’ college tuition? Modestino is “pessimistic” about whether big employers relaxing their educational credential requirements is truly part of a “culture shift.”

And with recent shifts in the economy she has concerns about the future of work.

“Looking at where we are in terms of the business cycle and what the Fed’s doing with interest rates [there’s] the potential for us to overshoot and tip into a recession” Modestino warns.

The Fed raised its federal funds rate for the seventh time this year and more hikes are expected to arrive in 2023. Experts like Modestino worry this could trigger a recession which would mean a slowdown in hiring and potential job and salary cuts.

Modestino advised her own son — who has a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice — that he needs to capitalize on the hot job market and get on a career path.

“We don't know if it’s going to be a soft landing in the labor market in the next six months” she says. “So I would certainly urge any young people … that now's the time to make those decisions. Because I do worry that the window’s closing on those opportunities.”

She anticipates that when workers are plentiful again and employers have many applications to sift through many companies will “revert back to the lowest common denominator” when they’re hiring — a four-year college degree.

So is getting a bachelor’s degree actually worth it?

Parents may have long encouraged their kids to pursue higher education but Modestino points out that there are many jobs that don’t require a four-year college degree. And so making that big decision about whether to go to college should depend more on the young person’s career goals.

For example you don’t need a bachelor’s degree to become a phlebotomist but it’ll likely require a certification in phlebotomy. On the other hand a PhD is necessary to become a tenured college professor.

That said having more credentials can look good on a resume and open doors for inexperienced workers — especially when job opportunities aren’t as abundant and employers can afford to be choosy.

In a recession or weaker labor market having an academic credential to your name can often have a “sheepskin effect” Modestino says — an economic phenomenon where employers pay higher wages to workers with degrees.

A study from Georgetown University found that bachelor’s degree holders earn 31% more than those with an associate’s degree and 84% more than someone with a high school diploma. But higher education doesn’t always equate to higher earnings.

“When you're in a labor market like this we've seen wages actually rising faster at the bottom because they're so desperate for talent. And so [employers are] actually trying to hire on talent and reward on talent rather than just a credential” explains Modestino.

But keep in mind that students pay a price for that extra earning potential. With about 43 million borrowers in the U.S. who owe over $1.6 trillion in student debt getting a degree isn’t always worth the financial burden. Parents pushing their kids to get higher education just for the sake of it might want to have a bigger conversation about whose interests they’re prioritizing.

“There's been this message for at least the last two decades that college is the only pathway” says Modestino.

“That's been a disservice I think to some young people who would have been better off going to a vocational technical school or taking a different pathway through workforce training and development.”

Open-chip surgery is a thing. And it involves ion beams. This came as news to me as I wandered through Intel's lab in Haifa Israel and no sooner had I learned about its existence I came face to face with the impressive machine that performs the surgery. It's surprisingly small quiet even and it has one of the coolest names imaginable: Focused Ion Beam or FIB for short.

When it comes to fixing a faulty processor there's no easy way to do it. I should have known that performing bypass surgery on chips with transistors only nanometers across would require intense effort and precision. Yet it's so easy to disregard what goes into making a chip when you're regularly benchmarking heaps of them like I am.

But as I'm standing in the FIB lab watching an engineer hone in on a microscopic area inside a chip and alter how it functions with extreme accuracy the intense effort that goes into each stage of the chipmaking process hits me like a ton of bricks. The fact that any of these chips exist and we get new ones every single year is mind boggling.

The reason I'm here at Intel's Israel Development Center (IDC) is to get a glimpse of what it takes to develop manufacture and validate a processor. Intel's IDC is where a lot of the legwork takes place in the creation of its processor architectures including many of those familiar to PC gamers over the years. Skylake Kaby Lake Coffee Lake Ice Lake Rocket Lake Alder Lake and now Raptor Lake chips—these all originate with IDC.

So you could say it's a good place to learn about the intricacies of building a processor from scratch.

""You have a spare tyre in your car I have a spare block in my CPU.""

Our tour begins at the end: the Post Silicon Validation Lab. This is where engineers team up with manufacturers OEMs and partners to ensure that Intel's upcoming chips work well in their systems. While most PC builders will work to their own spec most large-scale system builders are working to Intel's.

To one side of me Microsoft Surface laptops with the latest mobile chips. To the other two Alienware desktops running Raptor Lake. These systems were in the lab in September so at least a month in advance of the 13th Gen's launch if not long before our hoard of journalists were bused in.

At the end of the room sits a drawer of goodies including two early Raptor Lake samples. Though what's more out of the ordinary in this lab is the PCIe 5.0 test card. When Intel adopted Gen 5 for its 12th Gen CPUs for the first time there were no add-in cards capable of utilising Gen 5 ports. Intel had to make one for itself. It seems so obvious in that testing environment that such a device would be required but I hadn't thought about how testing new features on your unannounced or high-performance products often means building cutting-edge testing vehicles too. It's not a sleek looking device but it's not particularly shoddy either and I'm told it gets the job done.

Intel's PCIe 5.0 test card is a pretty nifty-looking piece of gear. (Image credit: Intel)

This validation lab is also where we hear of Alder Lake's first boot on Windows. The 12th Gen chips were the first to use Intel's new hybrid architecture: a slightly less homogenous approach to computing utilising both Performance-cores (P-cores) and Efficient-cores (E-cores) on a single die. This disparate build requires a different approach to OS optimisation and Intel's engineers made no bones about the hours it took to boot an Alder Lake CPU into Windows for the first time.

The first time Intel booted the chip was from the very building I was standing in. But the 12th Gen chip wasn't. The chip was located over 6000 miles away in the US. A completely remote first boot.

Could you send us one of these adjustable chassis please Intel? (Image credit: Intel)

We head out the lab the way we came in back into a room lined with test benches for aisle after aisle. This is Intel's stress and stability area: where CPUs are put through their paces to see if they're ready to ship or if another stepping is required. Intel has some of the most modular and impressively compact test benches I've ever seen and I'm only slightly (very) jealous of them. The PC Gamer test benches are a mess by comparison—functional (mostly) but messy. These are gorgeous modular and compact by comparison.

Intel is running what must be hundreds of systems with bespoke hardware automated programs and cooling. The liquid cooling loops throughout Intel's labs are actually plumbed into the wall for goodness' sake which is the first time I've seen anything of the sort.

There are rows and rows of test benches just like this. (Image credit: Intel)

As we're walking through the aisles of test benches there are heaps of recognisable codenames stuck to each and every one: RPL (Raptor Lake) and ADL (Alder Lake) among them. There is more often than not a familiar benchmark running on a constant pre-programmed loop too. 3DMark is being used to measure the might of these chips and we're told that engineering samples from different stages have variable standards set for stability in order to get the go-ahead to move to the next stage of the operation.

Then we're onto power and thermal performance testing though it's not so much next in a chip's life as it's just where we're ferried to next. I'm told there's plenty of communication between teams and a constant back and forth on samples so it's less of the one-way street to validate a chip as you might imagine it to be.

Most of the gear in power and thermal testing will be familiar to PC gamers. (Image credit: Intel)

This is where a lot of debugging for future chips happens in regards to applications that customers like you and me might actually use.

Gaming is the benchmark of choice for many of the chips being tested while we're in the lab. Here Intel is pairing its CPUs namely Raptor Lake at this time with Nvidia and AMD graphics cards. It has a whole lot of them and lots of consumer motherboards lining the workbenches alongside accurate thermal and power monitoring tools. A handful of high-end cards were being tested in Shadow of the Tomb Raider while I was in the room with intermittent monitors flickering to life with graphs showing voltage curves and temperatures.

Intel uses some heavy-duty testing gear mixed in with off-the-shelf parts. (Image credit: Intel)

The engineers here are also using standard CPU coolers to better replicate how these chips will be actually setup out in the wider world.

All roads lead to the Class Test Lab. Every engineering sample spotted in a database or sold on eBay over the past few years once made its way through here. We're told it's the most engineering focused lab at Intel but it's said with a smirk. It has the desired effect of getting a rise out of our Intel tour guides from other departments at least.

Everywhere you look in the class test lab is another rack of chips being tested. (Image credit: Intel)

In this lab which is lined with racks of test machines and containers with multiple generations of samples within Intel is able to classify blocks independently of each other. ""You have a spare tyre in your car I have a spare block in my CPU"" an engineer tells us.

Each block in a CPU is a functional component. They range in size from the smallest of buses to a whole core component. Having the ability to classify these on a block by block level offers flexibility in both construction and troubleshooting so it's an important step in speeding up the design and validation process.

If it's broken we'll find it.

Electrical validation offers another way to check a processor for errors. This is primarily a job for robots which work through trays of chips installing them into a motherboard one by one and run various scenarios and configurations to check for errors. We're stood by some of Intel's older testing tools which require some human calibration to prevent a robot arm jabbing its suckered finger into the socket. Though close by is a brand new machine. This fancy number we're told removes the need for even more human configuration allowing for swifter more comprehensive data gathering.

Intel even has a robot that slots RAM sticks into a motherboard. The future is now. (Image credit: Intel)

As you might already be noticing there are many steps to validating a processor before its final design or release. But what happens when one of these steps finds something isn't working as intended? That depends on the error of course but when an error is found the chip heads to a department called Component Debug.

""If it's broken we'll find it"" an engineer called Arik tells us.

If you know what you're looking for you can spot errors even in these two nondescript images. (Image credit: Intel)

In debug they uncover the root cause of an issue. Say a chip isn't hitting the speed expected of it to give one example of myriad things that could go wrong with billions of transistors in play someone has to figure out why. Arik explains to us that in this example they'd be looking for a path that's limiting frequency or causing instability.

To do that they can scan the CPU with a laser to find areas where something isn't looking right. The image they get back from the scan sort of looks like red noise to me but I'm no electrical engineer. It's absolutely some sort of electrical divination but from these splodges of red and black Arik and his team can spot where something doesn't look right. From there they can attempt to devise a permanent fix.

If you look closely here the ACB signals don't match the ABC signals. To test if this is the cause of a bug the green path will be added to the CPU in the FIB lab. (Image credit: Intel)

Then it goes to the FIB lab. I began this feature talking about the Focused Ion Beam machine and it's because it blows my mind. The FIB tool sits in the centre of the room. It's smaller than I imagined. This is used to mill a CPU and fire ions on it until it works. Sounds so simple right?

To fix a CPU first it has to be milled creating a tiny upside down pyramid shape in the silicon. This area is tough to see with the naked eye but these systems have an electron microscope at hand to help with that. With a microscopic worksite created an ion beam is blasted into it to either deposit materials in order to etch a new pathway into the silicon—a tiny bridge or connection that wasn't there before—or destroy one. It's marvellous.

The issues and their potential fixes from debug end up in a bucket of work for a FIB team to look at patch up and send back for retesting. The key thing here is that the blueprints for a processor known as masks aren't necessarily being changed before a fix is found and tested to ensure it works. This way when the debug team find a fault and suggest a fix the FIB lab can etch the fix into a chip at a nanometre level and then fire it back for retesting If the issue is resolved great that's a change for the next stepping of an engineering sample along with many other fixes.

The end result would you believe. (Image credit: Intel)

The one thing you have to be extremely careful about in the FIB lab is vibration however. One small movement could send an ion beam on a destructive path across perfectly fine silicon. Even though the FIB machine is on a vibration-proof section of the floor from where I'm standing I'm constantly checking my feet don't tread over the edge as I watch someone carry out silicon surgery less than a metre away.

We leave the FIB lab and head back to wrap up the day. At Intel's IDC Haifa lab we've met the people behind validation design and development for Intel's processors but to get an idea of manufacturing we need to head down the road to Fab 28.

Fab 28

""Every die wants to live.""

An hour away from Tel Aviv a few hours from Haifa just outside a city called Kiryat Gat is one of Intel's major manufacturing hubs: Fab 28. This is one of few places worldwide with bleeding-edge fabrication capability. It's where I'm given a rare opportunity to not only tour the fab facility but walk inside the beating heart of a chip fabrication plant known as the cleanroom.

If you have a 12th Gen or 13th Gen processor in your gaming PC it may well have come from here. Intel likes to split production of any one chip across multiple locations—eggs in baskets and all that—but a great deal of its top gaming processors come from right here.

I dare not think of the risk assessment Intel had to carry out to let gaggles of journalists enter its hallowed halls but somehow we were allowed to enter. Above the door a motto created by the Intel engineering team: ""Every die wants to live.""

The Gown Room staff are very particular about you wearing your bunny suit correctly. (Image credit: Intel)

But before I can step foot in the cleanroom itself I must take the necessary precautions. Intel is serious about no contaminants getting inside the cleanroom following a few too many issues with dust crumbs and pizzas making their way into the fab floor back in the early days. Nowadays Intel has rigorous rules for attire on entry. Hence the bunny suit I'm instructed to don in the gown room before I'm allowed to enter.

The bunny suit has undoubtedly become one of the more famous symbols of Intel throughout its history—just behind the Intel bong. That's bong as in the five-note song played at the end of every Intel advert for years not the other thing. I don't even know what that is.

Once upon a time these famous protective suits included ventilators that engineers would have to wear for the duration of their 12-hour shifts. Nowadays the tools each come with their own controlled environment so they're no longer required. Instead engineers have to wear only a fabric face mask hood hair net gloves more gloves overalls and tall boots. All of which is washed stored reused or recycled in the gown room in a cordoned off area at the entrance of the cleanroom.

Though the 12-hour shifts remain. In fact many of those that work in the roles responsible for the day-to-day operations of the fab will work relatively long shifts including those lining the desks in the control room.

The other thing I'm handed for my cleanroom visit is a specially-made cleanroom safe notepad and pen. You wouldn't think much of them to look at—they're fairly standard looking jotting utensils—but it's a good example of the standards that must be kept to ensure a smooth operation.

FOUPs fly overhead throughout the major thoroughfares in the fab. (Image credit: Intel)

From the preparation area it's a short walk to the cleanroom doors. The first thing I notice as I approach are the lights bathing everything in a yellow glow after them. That's not just for show. Intel uses yellow lights to protect the wafers from harmful rays causing unwanted exposure on the nascent CPUs. This is a factory built to etch wafers with lithography after all and that means light is the primary tool with which to go about that.

It's all one big fab.

My first thought upon entering the fab is how gargantuan it is. It goes on seemingly forever in one direction and we're a football field or two away from the end in the other. Fab 28 is connected up to Fab 18 and to Intel's engineers ""it's all one big fab."" Someday soon it'll also be connected to Intel's Fab 38 which is currently in construction next door.

Fab 38's floor plan makes Fab 28 look almost small by comparison but it's largely just steel girders and colossal cranes right now.

My second thought upon entering the fab is slight concern at the wafer bots screeching along above my head. These are known adorably as FOUPs (Front Opening Unified Pods) and you can't see it from the cleanroom floor but above our heads there's an automated superhighway for FOUPs that can travel at even faster speeds to reach the far ends of the fab. These bots are how all wafers go from point A to point B inside the fab then onto point C D E F and so on—there are many stages to the chip making process and I don't pretend to know them all.

As a stack of wafers is finished in one machine a FOUP zooms over two lines descend from under it the wafers are secured and it reels them up into its cold robotic embrace. Then it figures out the best route to take to the next station and zips off thataway. Potentially slowing or stopping on occasion along the way to allow another bot to give way to traffic on a busy intersection.

This system like most in the fab is entirely automated and is a part of Intel's Automated Material Handling System.

Not sure how I'd feel about working at my desk with FOUPs flying overhead. (Image credit: Intel)

There are also plenty of engineers at work to ensure the fab is functioning properly and efficiently some of which work in the cleanroom and others that monitor progress from the ROC or Remote Operation Control—a 24/7 control tower where every two hours the entire staff gets up for some routine stretching to if my memory serves me Israeli psychedelic trance duo Infected Mushroom. They say it's really important to them that everyone has a break—they work long 12-hour shifts—but we didn't chance upon this ritual. With a smile they admit they've been doing it for every group which works out to roughly six two-hourly stretches in an hour or so.

Next door to ROC—close enough you can hear their psy-trance through the door—is DOR or Defect Operational Review. This team is the first defence against dodgy wafers scouring data and harnessing statistics to uncover the cause of defects out of the fab floor. Any issue however big or small could come from a number of sources: a specific tool a process a material. It's a key job and the relatively small team here take care of all of it.

Dave is that you? Oh no sorry. (Image credit: Intel)

But I'm wrapped up in my overalls for a reason and over in the cleanroom a few friendly engineers took the time out to talk us through the tools and processes they're working on each day. I would think it's a strange place to spend a lot of time mainly for the yellow lights and bunny suit. But also because you can recognise your coworkers while you're there by only their badge and eye colour.

An Intel engineer explains a few of the key tools surrounding me as we walk further into the fab. It's all frightfully expensive equipment—from the likes of Cymer Tokyo Electron Limited (TEL) and ASML—but it's the lithographic tools that I'm told are the priciest. At one point we stand next to an ASML Twinscan immersion system which will cost $100 to $200 million and we're facing another pricey tool a TEL Lithius Pro V.

Bear in mind some of these tools can handle over 200 wafers in an hour and they're absolutely massive and there's a seemingly endless amount of them.

If you can believe it these DUV tools are on their way out and the next-generation will require even more space and cost that much more money. Hence why Fab 38 is springing up next door. The next few nodes from Intel will require masses of EUV machines for Extreme Ultraviolet and will allow for the progress to smaller and more efficient process nodes.

Yet one tool used inside the cleanroom might be more familiar to us PC gamers and that's the Microsoft HoloLens set up nearby. Unlike your VR headset gathering dust in the corner the Intel team actually uses this kit for training new staff. A routine job is pre-programmed in by a more experienced member of the team and the new staff member has prompts images and explanations so they may better learn the process on the job.

AR training is a relatively new addition to the cleanroom. Intel introduced it just a few months before the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 which by most people's opinion is pretty good timing.

And with that our time in the fab comes to a close. A short trip through a very long building but you could spend all day in there just rooting around the maze of tools.

Yet the cleanroom is just one slice of the fab. There's also the roof space where the cleanroom's controlled environment is maintained; the sub-fab which houses the important facilities for power management chemicals etc.; and then the dirty utilities floor below that which as you might imagine houses all the less sanitary power and waste facilities. Four floors total.

You might be able to spot me. I'm in the back third from the right. (Image credit: Intel)

As we walk out from the yellow light and back to the gown room to get back into our civvies we take a snap. I'm at the back on the right of the photograph feeling pretty content. Life goal achieved.

Fab 38

More of Fab 38 had been constructed during my visit than shown in this photograph. There were certainly a lot more cranes. (Image credit: Intel)

Fab 38—10 bigger than Fab 28

Fab 28 is big. Fab 38 is massive. When Fab 38 is completed it will house tools capable of delivering EUV-based process nodes which won't come a moment too soon for the next generation of processors.

EUV technology offers to dramatically reduce the complexity of making a modern processor and continue the descent into smaller and more efficient nodes. Up until now engineers have been working tirelessly to find new ways to stuff more transistors into a given area of silicon with existing 193nm technologies. That means tricking a 193nm lithographic source into producing a much denser and efficient product. They've generally been quite successful at it too using multi-patterning and masks to get the desired results. But it involves more steps more ways for things to go wrong and generally will continue to get more expensive as time goes on.

That wouldn't be very 'Moore's Law is alive and well' would it? So Intel and its like-minded competition has other plans: EUV.

EUV uses extreme ultraviolet wavelengths that are roughly equivalent to a 13.5nm source cutting out a heap of extra steps and improving yields. Basically saving a whole lot of time and money. It was once upon a time considered too difficult to ever really work in practice. However that's a challenge most boffins couldn't resist and lo and behold we're now on the precipice of EUV process nodes from all the major chipmakers including Intel TSMC and Samsung. The impossible is becoming reality.

That's Fab 28 in the background. (Image credit: Intel)

The shift to EUV is still a massive undertaking however. Not the least bit because these machines are somehow even more pricey than the ones they replace. The other challenge is where do you put these machines: they're bigger than ever partially due to requiring even more controlled environments to function and they won't easily fit where older machines exist today.

The answer: you have to build a big new fab to house them. And that's exactly what Intel's doing with Fab 38 and its other new fab developments in Germany and the US.

But Fab 38 is nowhere near ready to build chips yet. What I'm staring at from across the top of a multi-story car park is primarily the foundations of a very expensive building wrought from thick girders of metal and up to 42 metres into the Earth.

Every square metre matters in a fab. Intel avoids having pillars in the fab for this reason and instead uses a metal frame circumventing the outer walls of the building. It's not a cheap design decision nor is it an easy one to carry out. In fact Intel has hired the world's second largest crane to lift the constituent parts of this metal frame into place.

This isn't the supermassive crane but by comparison this crane would have looked tiny. (Image credit: Intel)

I'm told Intel had wanted the world's biggest crane but that it was busy building a nuclear power plant in the UK. So it had to settle for the second-largest. Our guide tells us that even this crane costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to operate each day.

The other key ingredient for the fab is concrete. The construction requires so much that Intel has three concrete factories set up dedicated to getting it to the site. To get the concrete from these sites to the fab construction a large fleet of trucks is required. That causes another issue: congestion. Israel's main highways and roads seem in good enough condition and on our travels it looks like they're building a lot more of them but we did get stuck in traffic a handful of times. To try and avoid causing that logistical nightmare and to not make matters worse for those nearby Intel's concrete trucks only travel at night.

The exact date when the fab will be finished isn't set but it'll be ready sometime in the middle of the decade. Likely it'll miss out on the first wave of EUV processes out of Intel with Intel 4. It takes so long to build new capacity Intel is essentially betting on demand many years in advance of when it'll come. It's a forecasting nightmare: we're just off the back of unprecedented demand for silicon and now we're in a period of a relatively slow market for processors.

But if another such wave of demand for chips comes again in the future Intel says it will be prepared. Fab 38 has more room to grow if needed it's just a matter of when it can hire an extremely large crane.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9pbnRlbC1jb25maXJtcy1tZXRlb3ItbGFrZS1oYXMtYXYxLXZpZGVvLWVuY29kaW5nLWFuZC1kZWNvZGluZy1zdXBwb3J00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel confirms Meteor Lake has AV1 video encoding and decoding support,"Intel Meteor Lake with AV1 decoding

Intel Media Driver video coding matrix confirms AV1 support for Meteor Lake.

The decentralized architecture of Intel Meteor Lake will enable the company to offer more flexibility when it comes to graphics and video coding support. The integrated Xe-LPG graphics a successor to Xe-LP on Tiger Lake series will enable new gaming modes and improve encoding capabilities.

Intel has now confirmed that the MTL (Meteor Lake) will officially support AV1 8bit and 10-bit video encoding and decoding just as DG2 (Arc Alchemist) series. This is a new royalty free video format that is up to 50% more efficient than H.264 format.

Support for low-power AV1 encoding was already mentioned in a leaked slide posted by Igor’sLAB a few months ago. The update to Media Driver now confirms it.

The AV1 decoding and encoding support for Meteor Lake will bring should fast-forward the adoption of this video format by popular streaming services. The AV1 encoding is now supported by AMD RDNA3 NVIDIA Ada and Intel Alchemist. This support will soon be expanded for AMD/NVIDIA mobile products.

According to OneRaichu a product codenamed “MTS-S” which should stand for desktop series could actually be canceled. This rumor is definitely on a surprising note given how much we have learned about said product already. However this leaker has a good track record especially for Intel related content.

Recently there was a leak featuring internal Intel slides revealing the plans for Raptor Lake series refresh. This product would appear around a third quarter next year so just about when news on desktop Meteor Lake were to be expected. Should these rumors turns out true this should not really change plans for the Meteor Lake mobile deployment though.

We know the icehouse was a big deal because the Sumerians like to name each year after something significant that happened within it. Year 13 was the year of the icehouse. It is described in the surviving cuneiform tablets as being twice as long as it was deep and insulated with branches of tamarisk.

What we cannot know is whether this was Shulgi’s innovation or whether ice pits had been built previously perhaps even before the founding of the Sumerian civilization. But if it was his or his engineer’s idea it would take more than 4000 years for the use of ice to become as unremarkable as it is today. Yet historical sources for it remain limited perhaps because even then it seemed ordinary.

This is a fundamental obstacle with history: it is fickle. That thing we might be interested in might not have been of interest to the ancient writer. In the case of Sumer the clay tablet we might hope to tell us what we hope to know could simply have been ground into dust by time. Or in the case of more Classical texts the papyrus scroll of our needs may simply not appeal to its copyist. So much knowledge has been lost. So many books by famous and important ancient writers we know of simply do not survive. Take for example our sources for no lesser figure than Alexander the Great: while we know that contemporary historians wrote about him their works never made it through the centuries. While these works were cited by historians like Arrian and Quintus Curtius Rufus they wrote at least 400 years after the events they described. This complicates things for those of us today who might wish to discern what really happened so very long ago.” Looking into this distant past we like Louie Kamookak are detectives but with even less to go on.

Nevertheless we can still perhaps trace a through line of ice storage and usage from these distant times at least as far as the Classical era. References to icehouses dry up after Shulgi’s momentous achievement returning to the tablets some two hundred years later when icehouses are recorded in Mari a Bronze Age kingdom in eastern Syria. The question we cannot answer is whether there might have been an exchange of ice technology between the Ur of Shulgi and the Mari of Zimri-Lim. Given the volume of correspondence that survives from the Near Eastern Bronze Age we must consider it a possibility not least because of the this tantalising fact: Shulgi was married to a woman named Taram-Uram the daughter of Apil-KinShulgi’s contemporary and ruler of Mari.

Mari grew up on a trade crossroads between Mesopotamia and Babylon. Not only is it considered to be one of the earliest planned cities it was also a center of technical innovation. Its people were great canal builders both for irrigation and navigation constructing one that ran 126 km past the city allowing traders a more direct route that bypassed the long and winding Euphrates. The icehouses crop up towards the end of Mari’s time of influence the late nineteenth century b.c.e. when the city was ruled by the so-called Lim Dynasty.

History does not seem to have run smoothly for the Lims. Their first ruler Yaggid-Lim successfully passed the throne to his son Yakhud-Lim. Despite various successes including expanding his city-state’s irrigation and refortifying his wall Yakhud-Lim found himself becoming vassal to the more powerful city of Aleppo then of the Mesopotamian city Eshunna and then having reasserted his independence one more at war with the Assyrians. All this before being assassinated by his son.

That would have been that for the Lim Dynasty were it not for Zimri-Lim Yaggid-Lim’s apparent grandson in approximately 1776 b.c.e. And it is to Zimri-Lim that we must turn to find our ice.

Having cemented his relationship with Aleppo by marrying its king’s daughter Zimri-Lim sought to restore Mari to its former glory. He did so through diplomacy marrying his daughters to neighboring kings allying with the powerful kingdom of Babylon to his south and thanks to the frequent letters exchanged with his married-off daughters keeping himself abreast of everything around him through what is best described as a familial intelligence network. His vast archive of correspondence and official records was uncovered by archaeologists in the 1930s. Written in Akkadian the official language of Near Eastern diplomacy these tablets—more than 22000 of them—shine an extraordinary light into the life and workings of the Syrian mid-Bronze Age. And it is one of these tablets the so-called Tablet of Zimri-Lim now housed in the Louvre that tells of the foundation of an icehouse in Terqa not far from Deir ez-Zor on the banks of the Euphrates.

It seems that the Terqa icehouse was not unique. Zimri-Lim claims to have built similar icehouses across his kingdom. But while we know from the tablets that they existed we have no idea what they looked like how they were stocked with ice nor how they were maintained. Our best guess suggests that they might have been similar to later examples built by the Persians. This would seem to make sense. Though the surviving ancient Persian icehouses called yakhchals were built around 400 b.c.e. much later than the those of Zimri-Lim there is no reason that their technology should not have existed a good 1300 years later. A yakhchal works by evaporative cooling. In the dry desert air the temperature drops fast after sunset often going below freezing at higher altitudes. The yakhchal’s domed structure allows this cold air to pour inside and into the pit within while the conical walls draw warmer air up and out. In addition the structure is built of a particular mortar called sarooj made to a specific recipe that includes sand goat hair clay egg whites ash and lime. It is both water resistant and an excellent insulator.

A yakhchal gives you ice and cold food storage under specific regional conditions — were there higher humidity here it simply wouldn’t work — and those conditions exist on the site of Mari. But though it seems highly likely we cannot know if the two cultures used a similar or the same technical idea to make their ice. There is a missing link between them in the chain of ideas so we cannot connect them. We can only suppose.

Nor can we connect the Persian use of ice with that of Ancient Greece. We know for example that snow was available in the markets of late fifth century b.c.e. Athens. There is a story recounted by the rhetorician Athenaeus about the comedian Diphilus whose many plays only survive in fragments in which he attends a dinner at the house of a woman called Gnathaena where the wine is cooled with snow sent by one of her lovers. We know too from Chares of Mitylene that when Alexander came to Petra after his conquest of Nabataea he ordered the construction of ice pits to be filled with snow and protected with oak branches. Lacking the climactic conditions that allowed the Persians to build their yakhchals the Greeks took a different tack to storing the cold. We find it described in Plutarch though the pits he records were covered with straw and cloth.

Similar techniques were practiced in Italy from the Roman period into the nineteenth century. In his book The History of Ancient and Modern Wines Alexander Harrison quotes a Mr. Lumsden who describes the collection of snow for use in Rome at a site known as Hannibal’s Camp:

Subscribe for counterintuitive surprising and impactful stories delivered to your inbox every Thursday Notice: JavaScript is required for this content.

“On this dry plain they dig pits without any building about fifty feet deep and twenty-five broad at the top in the form of a sugar loaf or cone. The larger the pit the snow no doubt will preserve better. About three feet from the bottom they commonly fix a wooden grate which serves for a drain if any of the snow should happen to melt which otherwise would stagnate and hasten the dissolution of the rest. The pit thus formed and lined with pruning of trees and straw is filled with snow which is beat down as hard as possible till it becomes a solid body. It is afterwards covered with more prunings of trees and a roof is raised in form of a low cone well thatched over with straw.”

So not wildly dissimilar to Alexander’s pits at Petra.

Ice so stored was then sold in shops or hawked on the streets of Ancient Rome much to the disapproval of Seneca who in his work Naturales Quaestiones lamented its use as a “true fever of the most malignant kind.” Sniffy old Seneca aside ice was a serious luxury business even if its transportation from store to city often caused it to be spoiled with dirt which led to the invention described by Pliny the Elder of a vessel in which previously boiled water could be surrounded with this snow without contamination and left to freeze.

Such references to ice remain rare in the ancient canon. But this should not make us think that the thing they describe was rare as well even if it was not available to everyone. We have to tease the quotidian from our ancient sources. The everyday is most often mentioned as an aside for it is something the intended reader already knows and doesn’t need explaining to them. As L. P. Hartley wrote the past is a foreign country and we — the unintended readers — are frequently left to deduce from scant evidence just how differently they did things there.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYWRpbmd2aWV3LmNvbS9zeW1ib2xzL05ZU0UtQU5WUy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ANVS Stock Price and Chart — NYSE:ANVS,"Annovis Bio Inc. is a clinical stage drug platform company which engages in the development of drugs which aim to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD).

The problems began Friday according to information from the plant’s union.

A tube in a power boiler blew Friday night a post on IP Union Facebook page. “The water swung on the other boiler causing it to trip.”

With the boilers out of service the public noticed no steam was coming from the steam stacks at the top of the mill.

“We were able to recover from that but only had one turbine running and two recovery boilers” the post states. Then one of the recovery boilers tripped.

Because IP was unable to generate enough power in its internal power plant they began to rely on Santee Cooper for power.

However because of the hard freeze Santee Cooper was having trouble meeting the demand for electricity systemwide so it could not provide the amount of electricity needed for IP.

A company official told GAB News Santee Cooper notified the company of the situation but there was not enough time to get the company’s power-making back up and running.

With no power and below-freezing temperatures the black liquor inside pumps tanks and lines “froze solid” the post states.

“Once black liquor solidifies it does not thaw out. It turns into black concrete. We have two tanks on the third floor of the recoveries that you can see in” the post states. “It’s a big block of solid liquor.”

We were told the electricity was restored on Christmas Day which the post states was the easy part.

“Getting everything unplugged to start making pulp…That is going to take weeks. We are in serious trouble and it is going to be bad” the post states adding it “will cost this company millions” to recover from the damage.

Company spokesman Josh Fleming said Monday is too soon to know the accuracy of the predictions made by the union.

He told us nothing he has seen so far indicates it will take weeks to recover.

He did say the fact paper is not being made is costing the company a lot of money but he does not have an estimate on how much money is being lost.

He said unlike the paper mills located in the northern states Georgetown’s plant is not designed for the temperatures we experienced over the weekend because such weather is so rare in this part of the country.

Fleming said the company is in the process of getting boilers restarted so the steam from the stacks should be seen again “sooner rather than later.”

Fleming said as of this posting no layoffs are expected due to the damage.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhcmFkaXNlZnVuZXJhbGhvbWVwYi5jb20vb2JpdHVhcnkvbGluZGEta2lya2xhbmTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary | Linda Faye Kirkland of Sherrill Arkansas,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhcmFkaXNlZnVuZXJhbGhvbWVwYi5jb20vb2JpdHVhcnkvbGluZGEta2lya2xhbmTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021224D21BD0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

This is an important paper that makes a number of key points but the bottom line is we must act immediately to address the climate crisis. Hansen uses the framing ""human-made geoengineering of Earth’s climate must be rapidly phased out” to call for emissions elimination Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) and Solar Radiation Management (SRM).</p>

Here is a summary of some of the key points of this quite long (48 page) paper:</p>

1. The Earth Climate Sensitivity (ECS) — the Earth’s short-term response to a CO2 doubling — is higher than previously assumed. Most scientists said it was ~3ºC but Hansen et al now say it is 4ºC or more based on paleoclimate data. This means there is more warming “in the pipeline” than previously assumed.</p>

2. While humans have increased atmospheric CO2 by 50% since the industrial revolution the actual climate forcing from all the added greenhouse gases is now ~4W/m^2 which is equivalent to a doubling of CO2 (i.e. CO2e (including all greenhouse gases not just CO2) is about 560 ppm).</p>

3. Part of the current warming has been hidden by human-made particulate air pollution (aerosols) mainly sulfur. When North America and Europe started to reduce emissions after the introduction of clean air acts in the 1970's regional and global warming became more pronounced. In the past decades China and global shipping slashed sulfur emissions through cleaner fuels and sulfur filter systems ('scrubbers'). There are clear signals from ground ocean and satellite based observations that the rate of global warming has recently doubled which needs to be taken into account in risk assessments.</p>

4. Assuming today’s forcing (4 W/m^2) stabilizes and human-made aerosols are eliminated when all feedbacks — including “long-term” feedbacks — play out we are on track for about 10ºC warming and 6~7ºC if aerosols stay at today’s levels. This is a “scenario” and we still control our future though we are on track to increase climate forcing from today’s 4 W/m^2.</p>

If greenhouse gas forcing keeps growing at the current rate it could match the level of the PETM mass extinction within a century. We are increasing climate forcing 20X faster than in the PETM so “long-term” feedbacks won’t take as long as in the paleo record (though some feedbacks will still be much longer than a human lifetime).</p> 5.. We are increasing climate forcing 20X faster than in the PETM so “long-term” feedbacks won’t take as long as in the paleo record (though some feedbacks will still be much longer than a human lifetime).

""human-made geoengineering of Earth’s climate must be rapidly phased out” i.e. we must stop emitting greenhouse gases remove CO2 from the atmosphere and research and implement safe solar radiation management to counter the massive geoengineering experiment we are currently running; and (c) we must improve international cooperation to allow the developing world to grow using clean energy.</p> 6. The paper concludes that we must: (a) implement a carbon fee and border duty ( Fee and Dividend ); (b)i.e. we must stop emitting greenhouse gases remove CO2 from the atmosphere and research and implement safe solar radiation management to counter the massive geoengineering experiment we are currently running; and (c) we must improve international cooperation to allow the developing world to grow using clean energy.

7. A companion paper will be coming out that addresses the near-term shutdown of the AMOC and associated “multi-meter” sea level rise on a century timescale.</p>",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbnF1ZS1mcmFuY2UuZnIvZW4vcHVibGljYXRpb25zLWFuZC1zdGF0aXN0aWNzL3B1YmxpY2F0aW9ucy9zb3ZlcmVpZ24tZGVidC1hbmQtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC10cmFkZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sovereign Debt and International Trade,"One of the consequences of a sovereign default is that it makes it more difficult in a country to borrow from foreigners but also to trade with foreigners. As a consequence a sovereign default is more frightening for more open economies which should make more open economies more reluctant to default. Consequently more open economies should be able to sustain higher debt-to-GDP ratios because their willingness to pay their debt back should be higher. Moreover this higher willingness to pay should be anticipated by the financial markets which should translate into lower cost of financial borrowing. Finally countries should be tempted to enjoy this lower cost of borrowing and borrow more debt – although not enough to make default more likely.

The starting point of the paper is the long-run relationship between sovereign defaults in the world (as measured by the share of countries in the world that default weighted by their GDP) and international trade (total volume of trade divided by world GDP). It is apparent on the data that waves of default coincide with decreases in commercial integration.

Moreover a regression using historical data shows that in the years following a sovereign default imports decrease by 10% or more depending on the specification. The same is true for exports though the magnitude tends to be lower as defaulting countries are generally equilibrating their trade balance. Therefore total gains from trade are lower after a default.

From these stylized facts I write a sovereign debt model with strategic default and international trade. Not only do countries borrow from other countries to smooth their consumption over time but they also trade with the rest of the world to enjoy the benefits associated with specialization. The gains from trade can be computed directly from the openness ratio in the model. If a country defaults it loses its ability to borrow from financial markets and its trade costs increase which reflects a disruption in trade market credits. Since imports and exports tend to decrease proportionally because of this increase in trade costs more open countries find it more costly to default. I prove that because rational markets anticipate that more open countries benefit from lower default costs through lower interest rates. Impatient governments benefit from that discount to borrow more debt. In general equilibrium these properties stay true. Calibrations of a rich model including realistic debt maturities and possibility to redeem from default as well as fluctuations from terms of trade shows that governments emit more debt which they borrow at a lower interest rate and are less likely to default.

Finally I test these theoretical predictions empirically. To avoid reverse causality issues or spurious regressions driven by political cycles I use geographic instruments from the international trade literature as proxies for trade. The Frankel-Romer instrument is an instrument that predicts total trade in a country based on its geographic proximity with other big countries: small countries surrounded by big populated countries tend to be more than isolated large countries. The Feyrer instrument is a similar instrument that is dynamic: it takes advantage of the technical transformations in transport costs: air transport that was too expensive for trade became a more common tool for trade in the last decades. As a consequence the propension to trade of a country does not depend the same way on sea distance and air distance depending on the period we consider: air distance has become a more important determinant. Thanks to these instruments I can estimate plausible causal estimates for the effect of trade openness on spreads and debt. Let us assume that a country suddenly trades twice as much relative to its GDP as it happened in France between the 1960s and today. I find that such a country benefits from a 300 b.p. decrease in its spreads. Moreover this country tends to borrow twice as much debt."

If you want to see more stocks in this selection check out 5 Best Adtech Stocks To Buy.

Although there is weakness in the ad market driven by an uncertain economic outlook and expectations that a potential recession will crush consumer demand ad-tech stocks remain comparatively resilient. This is because marketers are now more selective with their advertising budget which means they are looking to spend those ad dollars efficiently. They now rely more on data and technology when it comes to marketing their products and services. Ad-tech firms are also benefiting from the transformation of ad spending from linear TV to connected TV.

In the beginning of December media buyer GroupM forecast that traditional TV ad spending would decline by 3.8% to $64.4 billion in 2023 with the drop offset by a 19% increase in ad spending on connected TV to $13.3 billion. The media buyer sees a similar pattern in 2024 and 2025 as well while CTV spending will accelerate by 1.8% to $20 billion by 2026.

It uses its own measurement and analytics across the advertising ecosystem providing brands with consistency and standardization in measuring the efficacy of their digital advertising spend.

Here is what Alger has to say about Magnite Inc. (NASDAQ:MGNI) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:

“Magnite provides an advertising supply side platform for publishers. The technology helps publishers such as network television stations or cable news providers automate the sale of digital advertising inventory across different formats and channels like desktop mobile video audio connected TV and over-the-top TV. Publishers monetize their digital advertising inventory by using Magnite’s platform to access a global market of ad buyers including advertising agencies that use supply side platforms. Magnite also helps sellers decrease costs and protect their brands and user experience. Magnite receives ad inventory from sellers and optimizes publishers’ revenue yields by processing the highest buyer bids. Currently Magnite keeps approximately 10% of ad spend as revenue (i.e. take rate) and passes on the remainder of the ad spend to publishers. Magnite’s clients include many of the world’s leading publishers of websites and mobile applications and the company believes that its platform reaches approximately 1 billion individuals globally. Shares of Magnite underperformed in the second quarter due to the growth market selloff and slower-than-expected growth in connected TV during the first three months of this year. We believe the 32% growth in connected TV was below expectations and due to a one-time issue with one of the company’s publishing partners that ran out of advertising inventory. Management noted the issue has been fixed and the company saw strong reaccelerating growth in April. Additionally we believe Magnite’s recent acquisition of video advertising company SpotX will significantly bolster the company’s positioning within connected TV a high-growth area of the digital advertising market that is taking share from linear TV ad budgets.”

In the last two years thematic funds have gained traction prompting mutual funds to add newer products in this category.In 2021 the net inflows into such funds were a little over Rs 25000 crore. While this number dipped to about Rs 21000 crore as of November 2022 thematic funds remain popular among the investor community.Given the emerging growth themes in India  experts do see inflows to thematic funds continuing in 2023.About 40% of the total equity schemes launched in 2022 by the mutual fund industry were thematic or sectoral funds.Unlike sectoral funds thematic funds are more broad-based and are as good as diversified equity funds said Santosh Navlani chief operating officer of ET Money.If one looks at the top-performing thematic funds in 2022 public sector thematic funds gave the best returns to investors.Stocks of public sector companies across many sectors had a stupendous year. Several stocks in the railways defence and banking turned multibaggers in 2022 driven by positive growth factors.The strong credit growth and a major clean-up of the balance sheet drove public sector stocks while the government’s push to increase spending on infrastructure and domestic manufacturing propelled the railways and defence sector outlook.“If the Indian economy will be the fastest growing in the world as many forecasts predict banking must do well. The sector is a direct reflection of a country's economic growth” Navlani said.Thematic or sectoral funds are riskier than regular diversified equity schemes given the higher exposure to equity.Therefore Navlani believes that for investors it's best to stick to a diversified equity fund instead of focusing on any themes.THEMES FOR 2023At a time when globally the US and the UK are on the brink of a recession and geopolitical tensions persist the growth outlook for India remains bright. Therefore sectors that are domestically linked are expected to do well and remain among the top bets for 2023 for analysts.Expecting credit growth and capital investment to play out as two broader themes in 2023 Motilal Oswal Broking expects sectors like banks financial services and insurance capital goods infrastructure cement housing defence and railways to be in focus.An uptick in the capex cycle saw order flows of most companies rising in double digits despite the Russia-Ukraine war and higher commodity prices. State Bank of India  Larsen & Toubro ITC Titan Co PI Industries Indian Hotels  and Bharat Forge are among the bets for the brokerage.Jefferies India sees multi-year growth prospects for the automobile sector ahead and is also bullish on cement chemicals consumer finance and real estate. Despite the higher home loan rates analysts believe that the upcycle in the Indian residential property market is unlikely to be disrupted.“With the RBI rate hike cycle nearing an end and fundamentals still strong we believe real estate stocks should O-PF (outperform) in 2023” Jefferies said.",,,,,,

I am lucky enough to have a bathtub at home and love to impulse-buy bubbles and salts. I'm a novelist and not a medical professional but I can attest to the fact that a lavender bath salt seems to work wonders. So when I read that The Springs Resort & Spa in Pagosa Springs Colorado hired Dr. Marcus Coplin a naturopathic medical doctor as its first on-site medical director I was intrigued. Dr. Coplin's goal is to help guests understand the power of mineral-rich water to treat ailments from insomnia to arthritis. And so I thought I enjoy books about Victorian-era heroines ""taking the waters"" in Switzerland or Budapest could the age-old cure work for people like me?



At more than 1002 feet deep the Mother Spring aquifer is the deepest geothermal hot spring in the world. The Ute People discovered the spring hundreds of years ago and the waters have been used for healing ever since — indirectly. You see the Mother Spring itself is too dangerous for people as it comes with a surface temperature of around 131 degrees Fahrenheit making it far too warm for human exposure. But its waters are pumped into the pools around the spa which come with varying temperatures to suit everyone's mood. The waters contain 13 minerals including potassium magnesium zinc lithium iron and manganese which the hotel alleges can promote healthy skin lower blood pressure strengthen bones and muscles increase energy and much more.



When I first arrived at The Springs Resort & Spa a resort featuring 79 rooms and suites and 25 soaking pools I made a beeline to the Mother Spring. There I took a deep chest-expanding breath and inhaled the scent of sulfur mixed with chilly mountain air. This was when I realized why the Ute who came before us called this place ""Pah Gosa"" which loosely translates to ""water with a bad smell."" Don't worry. The smell dissipates as quickly as it comes allowing you to focus on the task at hand: total relaxation.



Yes the bubbling azure aquifer at the resort is a marvel. Though you don't even have to be a guest to experience it as the soaking pools fed by its depths can be accessed for free along the San Juan River in downtown Pagosa Springs or by hiking to the Piedra River Hot Springs or the more remote Rainbow Hot Springs.

After meeting the mother I made my way to my spacious suite where I discovered an array of wellness goodies and several ""soaking guides"" penned by Dr. Coplin. The guides suggested just how long to soak and how to make the most of the experience — including what to eat before and after and what temperature is optimal — along with explanations of what happens in the body during contrast bathing.



""It is incredibly beneficial for the person soaking to understand how the different temperature levels can affect their body"" Coplin shared ""so they can journey through multiple stages of hydrothermal self-guided wellness to receive long-lasting and exceptional results."" Next to the guides sat a ""cell phone sleep sack"" which felt like just the right mix of suggestion and command to turn off the rest of the world and settle into this restorative experience.

According to my personalized soaking guide I was meant to eat a nutritious dinner with protein heavy greens and high fiber. That was easy thanks to The Barefoot Grill the on-site restaurant located next to the soaking pools. Its menu came with two sides — Comfort Food and Health/Wellness Food. I went for a bit of both ordering a burger with a delicious kale salad and one of the resort's divine mocktails.



Then as my guide suggested I made my way to the spring which sat just outside my window to experience its magic for myself.

It was evening as I approached the soaking pools selecting the warmest one. I eased myself into the water and exhaled as it surrounded me. I lay back and looked at the stars; my muscles seemed to ease one by one. The mineral-rich water pressed against my skin. It felt like the best bath in the world the crisp air on my face a tonic. I switched between various temperature pools for a while and when I returned to my room I felt peaceful.

Sitting in the warm water isn't the only way to unwind here. The resort also offers wellness activities ranging from aqua yoga to sound baths a ""Hang Time"" experience (a sound bath while hanging in a hammock underneath Aspen trees) and more. The resort also offers a guided contrast bathing ritual called the Warrior Plunge which involves alternating soaking in hot water then dunking into a freezing cold plunge pool to help shock your system. According to the resort this therapy ""increases blood circulation flushes the body of toxins and reduces muscle inflammation. It is a natural way to exercise your vascular system by expanding and constricting your blood vessels."" There is some science to back up these claims. However the clinical jury appears to still be out on if it will cure you of all that ails you. But the most important takeaway is do you feel better after? If you do that's what matters.



Though the resort was the main attraction on my trip I'd be remiss not to say that the Pagosa Springs area has a lot more going on outside the property too. From hot air balloon rides over the Pagosa Mountains with Rocky Mountain Balloon Adventures to art galleries like Two Old Crows it's a destination worthy of exploration. While I didn't want to leave the soaking pools the town's delicious dining options like Kip's Grill Old Miner's Alley House Grill and Root Coffee beckoned.

I left The Springs Resort & Spa with the feeling I came for: renewal. And yes I took the soaking guides and some bath salts home with me to try to recreate the magic though I doubt I'll ever be as successful in my tiny little tub. Dr. Coplin added that he hoped guests would return again and again to The Springs allowing the mineral-rich soaking pools nourishing food enjoyable classes and spa treatments to help recover from the stresses of daily life and address complex health issues like arthritis and anxiety. You know just like going home again and getting a warm hug from a mother figure.

FMCSA denies petition to allow hair drug testing reports to Clearinghouse

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has denied a request from the Trucking Alliance to ""amend the definition of actual knowledge to include the employer's knowledge of a driver's positive hair test which would require such results be reported to the FMCSA Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse and to inquiring carriers.”

Trucking companies who have ""actual knowledge"" of a driver's positive urine drug test are currently required to report that test result to the Clearinghouse.

In its application for exemption the Trucking Alliance said it believes that because hair testing is more reliable and accurate than urine testing it is the “appropriate drug testing method for preemployment and random testing protocols.”

In denying the petition FMCSA said it lacks the statutory authority to grant the exemption request to amend the definition of actual knowledge to include the employer's knowledge of a driver's positive hair test.

The Department of Transportation including FMCSA is required to follow the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Mandatory Guidelines for technical and scientific issues related to testing for controlled substances. Because HHS has not yet issued final guidelines for hair testing FMCSA cannot grant the exemption.

The FAST Act transportation bill signed into law by President Obama in December 2015 allows for hair follicle drug testing as a DOT-approved method but not until HHS establishes guidelines for testing. The FAST Act mandated that those guidelines be developed within a year of the FAST Act becoming law but HHS did not publish proposed guidelines until September 2020. HHS has not yet issued a final version of those guidelines.

The Trucking Alliance is made up of a group of large carriers including Cargo Transporters Dupré Logistics Frozen Food Express J.B. Hunt KLLM Knight Transportation Maverick Transportation Schneider Swift Transportation U.S. Xpress and May Trucking Company.

FMCSA denies training exemption requests

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has denied petitions from two truck driving schools seeking waivers from certain provisions of the Entry-Level Driver Training regulations.

SBL Truck Driving Academy sought an exemption from the theory and behind-the-wheel instructor requirements contained in the ELDT regs for two of its instructors. SBL specifically requested an exemption from the requirement that instructors have at least two years of experience driving a commercial motor vehicle requiring a CDL of the same or higher class and/or the same endorsement level for which training is to be provided.

FMCSA said in its denial that SBL “presented insufficient evidence to establish that not complying with the provisions of the ELDT regulations relating to driving experience requirements for CMV instructors would meet or exceed the level of safety achieved by complying with the ELDT regulations.”

A separate request from the Western Area Career and Technology Center (WACTC) also sought an exemption from the theory and behind-the-wheel instructor requirements in the regulations. The provider said in its request it wanted to use an instructor with less than two years of CDL driving experience adding that it has been difficult to find qualified instructors. WACTC stated in its request that the instructor would meet the ELDT regulation’s requirement for two years of driving experience with a Class A CDL in August 2022.

FMCSA said if it allowed “an individual instructor to provide ELDT without the required driving experience it could open the door for similar exemption requests on a widespread basis” which would go against the goal of the regulations the agency added. Additionally because the instructor in question met the two-year requirement in August the request is now moot.

“Adding our 10th state to the Volvo Trucks Certified EV Dealer network is the perfect way to close out a year that has seen significant expansion of the electromobility ecosystem that is necessary to support battery-electric trucks” said Peter Voorhoeve president Volvo Trucks North America. “Our dealerships play a critical role for fleets in every stage of the transition to battery-electric trucks — from selecting the right vehicle configuration to securing incentive funding when available and then ensuring customers can maximize their uptime once the trucks are deployed.”

Two of Young Trucks’ technicians have completed Volvo Trucks’ hands-on training course that demonstrates how to safely maintain and repair electric drivetrains and components.

Additionally the dealership has invested in the necessary diagnostic tools for its maintenance bays and its service team has been outfitted with the personal protective equipment necessary to work with high-voltage systems. Young Trucks has dedicated one service bay for battery-electric trucks with plans to expand as adoption of the Volvo VNR Electric truck increases in the region.

Young Trucks opted to utilize a portable 50 kW Heliox charger to support charging its customers’ Volvo VNR Electric trucks. The portable charger provides the flexibility to move it to other bays as needed. In addition the charger has lower power requirements enabling the dealership to use its existing electrical service and fast-track its infrastructure deployment timeline.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Walk down a 30-foot hallway through a mosaic of photos showing hundreds upon hundreds of children with parents siblings and staff from Jacob’s Heart each image holding a story that starts with cancer and ends in triumph or in grief.

Take a turn past Maddy’s Jungle where toddlers frolic across the room’s tiger-print carpet ride stuffed-animal rockers and play with toys in front of a wall covered in an animal-filled forest scene. The room is named for the little girl who was among the first kids served by Jacob’s Heart to pass away. Maddy loved jungle creatures.

Pause before Art from the Heart a section of wall showcasing the work of bereaved siblings. There’s a cheerful goldfish beside handprints from a sister and brother named Angela and Alex and a green flower against a pastel background painted for Janet by Noemi who drew a heart by her sister’s name.

Head over to the volunteer room and check out decorations added to brown shopping bags to brighten the days of the children and families who receive weekly grocery deliveries to help them through unimaginably hard times. You’ll see bunnies and rainbows and nearby you’ll find the cards that healthy kids make to be mailed to kids who are sick: One has two penguins with a heart between them and a message that says “Let’s stick together.” Another has a sheep with googly eyes and a message in Spanish saying “There’s no one like you.”

Take a look at the mural in the Full Hearts room where volunteers bag groceries. The artwork shows a majestic lion its mane surrounded by a heart. After Johnny Robledo died at 16 his cousin painted the mural adding beside the lion some words Johnny left behind so people would know he didn’t depart this world in defeat: “I want people to know that I was here and that I fought.”

Poke around Caroline’s Closet a room full of clothing from a partner thrift store. You’ll see clothing for all ages plus necessities like soap cleaners and toothpaste. In a stack are about a dozen volunteer-knitted beanies to fit babies suffering the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation. “Beanies are a big request when the kiddies start losing their hair” says family support specialist Daniela Ramirez.

Stop in front of the large pinboard map showing the region from San Francisco south to King City. Each of the multitudinous pins represents a child with cancer whom Jacob’s Heart has helped colored according to the type of cancer. Most of the pins are clustered in Watsonville Santa Cruz and Salinas within the Watsonville-based nonprofit’s primary coverage area. Jacob’s Heart is seeking $40000 to bolster its services — and to start offering its help throughout Santa Clara County.

For parents whose child receives a cancer diagnosis troubles pile onto fears and worries: Caring for the young girl or boy — whose life has been catastrophically altered by a life-threatening or terminal illness and who may be hospitalized for months at a time and require treatments far from home — becomes all-consuming. A parent sometimes a single parent often has to quit their job. For the families Jacob’s Heart serves many with low incomes there’s not enough money not enough time. Siblings already traumatized by the knowledge their beloved family member may die can feel neglected putting more pressure on distressed mothers and fathers already struggling to meet one child’s now-vast needs.

Sebastian Van Deren of Gilroy was diagnosed in August 2020 with a rare brain cancer a week before his sophomore year in high school was to start. The diagnosis sent the Van Deren family into “hell on earth” says Sebastian’s mother Andrea 43 a yoga teacher and photographer. “Your whole world just falls out from underneath you” she says. Sebastian’s father James recalls watching his healthy and active son turn sick and weak from the cancer and the side-effects of radiation and chemotherapy. “We were happy when he would eat two grapes” says James 52 an electrician.

A school district nurse connected the family with Jacob’s Heart and the organization’s financial support guidance and compassion helped the Van Derens through their two-year nightmare. Today after two surgeries trips as far as Ohio for precision radiation treatment and six rounds of chemotherapy Sebastian 17 is cancer free on the honor roll in high school loves studying physics rides his bike for miles around his Gilroy neighborhood and continues attending teen events at Jacob’s Heart. “I’m just really glad to have who I have with me especially my family and Jacob’s Heart” Sebastian says. “Everybody there is so kind.”

In operation for 25 years Jacob’s Heart is named for another boy who survived cancer against long odds whose mother had to leave her job to care for him. The organization serves upward of 350 families at any given time working closely with the Bay Area healthcare facilities where young patients receive much of their treatment including Stanford Medical Center UC San Francisco and Kaiser Permanente. Jacob’s Heart relies on 14 full-time staff a host of contractors and hundreds of volunteers like Tanner Tedsen a local insurance agent who drops off groceries at families’ homes every week. “It’s all the cutest little kids you can imagine running out to thank you” Tedsen says.

The goals at Jacob’s Heart are fairly straightforward: to lighten the burdens on children and families from a life-changing diagnosis and to bring light to lives suddenly shadowed. The nonprofit takes a wrap-around approach embracing young patients and their families from babies to grandparents and helping them through every stage of illness treatment and beyond.

“We have a saying: Once a Jacob’s Heart family always a Jacob’s Heart family” says Allyssa Gil-Ojeda a coordinator at the nonprofit.

Jacob’s Heart’s offerings include family support in English and Spanish professional counseling peer mentorship transportation to medical appointments gas cards grants for bills and funerals social gatherings for teens trips to the beach zoo and amusement parks and Holiday Hearts seasonal gifts. It also provides an annual Forever Loved camp for parents and siblings who have lost a child to cancer and an annual Camp Heart & Hands staffed by Stanford pediatric nurses for families and their children in treatment or remission.

The nonprofit also forges links — between families and other service providers between kids and other kids who share a diagnosis that no other child can really understand and between families sharing similar ordeals including siblings going through traumatic events that have not touched their peers.

“What we really bring into a community is the social and emotional connection” says Heidi Boynton executive director of Jacob’s Heart and a cancer survivor. “Knowing that you’re not alone definitely changes things.”

Outside Jacob’s Heart on this particular day up in the mountains between Watsonville and Gilroy the Van Derens are camped in a county park among redwoods and oaks with their two small dogs Dexter and Lincoln. They camp there often.

The family walks down the trail to the redwood they call Big Tree. It’s a dozen feet across at the base — blackened by fire and bears scars from someone trying to cut it down. For the Van Derens Big Tree has become part of the story of their trials. “I don’t know how it survived but it did” James says. Sebastian tips his head back and gazes upward. “Through it all it’s just kept going” he says. “Look at it. You can’t even see the top. This tree is just so tall.”

Wayne was born on April 15 1942 in Grand Forks North Dakota to George and Lillian Gregoire. He was baptized and confirmed at St Jude’s in Thompson North Dakota.

He was preceded in death by his mother father sister Diane brother Doug three brothers-in-law and two sisters-in-law. He is survived by his wife Carol daughter Michelle and son David. He is also survived by two brothers-in-law and three sisters-in-law and many nieces nephews great-nieces and nephews and great-great nieces and nephews.

Wayne grew up on a farm in Thompson North Dakota and spent many hours working in the fields. After graduating from high school he went on to the University of North Dakota graduating with a degree in chemistry. During that time he joined the U.S. Army Reserve. He then moved to the Minneapolis area where he met and married the love of his life Carol and they have been married for 51 wonderful years.

After working as a chemist he turned his career path toward selling hospital laboratory equipment and diagnostic kits to hospitals which he thoroughly enjoyed. This endeavor took them to Omaha Nebraska for a year and then on to Denver Colorado for 2-1/2 years. In 1979 they relocated with his job back to Minnesota and settled in Eden Prairie. There they were blessed with two wonderful children whom he loved dearly.

Wayne was an extremely creative guy that dabbled in all kinds of crafts from painting pictures to working with stained glass. He loved to cook and after his retirement would always have dinner ready when Carol came home from work. He also loved cooking for friends and baking cakes when it was birthday time. He played Santa Claus at his brother-in-law and sister-in-law’s for many years and with a great big “Ho Ho Ho” he made it fun for all the little ones even into their adulthood.

He could fix anything from a broken stove to a broken heart. He loved working with wood and because of that love he saw a need to invent items that could help cabinetmakers in their shops. He spent countless hours creating and making his equipment and starting his own company Wynmatic Inc.

He and Carol especially after her retirement enjoyed many years traveling to trade shows and woodworking shops throughout the country. Mostly he cherished spending time with his family and friends that he loved dearly. In February of 2018 he became ill and after several months in hospitals and rehabs he was able to come home in the fall of 2018. Although he still struggled with health issues he was happy to be home and near those he loved so much.

Wayne had a deep faith in God and we know he is spending Christmas with his Lord and Savior. Services will be held at 11 a.m. Wednesday Jan. 4 at Pax Christi Catholic Church in Eden Prairie with visitation from 10-11 a.m. If so wished memorials can be made to the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center of Minnesota or Lightshine Canine.

Both All-Americans. One earning the honor twice the other once.

Both of them Team USA candidates along with several other area standouts who are graduating this spring. Nearly inseparable.

When Ethan Jacobs and Million Evans decided to drop their pursuits of academy soccer and come play for Robert Dougherty at Bay for the start of their sophomore years it opened them to a world of wide-ranging opportunities.

In a way it also saved each of them and allowed for the best to come through.

“I don’t think I was able to accomplish all of the things I wanted to accomplish the past three (years)” said Evans who signed with Cleveland State in November to continue his soccer career. “I came here my sophomore year and I don’t think I would have accomplished all of the things I did. The team set me up including the seniors from past years to succeed. I think it’s both of us leaving a legacy for the next guys to come up.”

“Yeah” Jacobs agreed nodding slightly as if Evans were present.

Jacobs and Dougherty were sitting at a table outside Bay’s gymnasium with Evans calling in on speakerphone on a mid-November afternoon as he was out of school sick but recovering.

Jacobs was also in the process of being recruited by some big-name Division I schools. He was yet to have made a decision.

“I was able to get comfortable with this team. I came in my sophomore year as well with Mill. We both made the decision to come” Jacobs said. “I wasn’t that confident coming in. I had lost a lot of confidence playing in academy (soccer). But coming into high school I really found myself and finding this perfect group of guys.”

Jacobs rattled off former All-Americans such as Brock Pickett and a “great friend” in Matt DeCapua as part of the group that helped him springboard toward success.

“I was able to be comfortable with them and getting really comfortable to play at my best has really brought me up to that status” he said.

“You know you’re blessed as a coach when you have the quality and quantity of the amazing players that have come through (our program)” Dougherty said. “I remember that (Million) had come home from Philadelphia and it was around Christmas time before his sophomore year. I was at a basketball game and he came running up there while I was watching (one of his players at the time) play and Million said ‘I’m coming back’.”

Dougherty was stunned and couldn’t have been happier saying he couldn’t wait and it was going to be amazing to have him back and have “so much fun.”

“Ethan had come back and made the same decision” Dougherty said. “It’s one of those things where I missed them horribly and obviously I knew for their growth and development that they’d get every bit they could possibly want with us they could playing with the academy program. In Ethan’s case it would probably be a better experience than the academy program because of the strength of our schedule and the popularity of our program.”

One such game drew over 10000 views on a livestream with Dougherty being correct in the amount of growth Jacobs could achieve. While Evans was named All-American his senior season Jacobs earned the honor twice his junior year and this season becoming the first Bay soccer player to be named an All-American twice.

Getting away from the academy soccer programs was a breath of fresh air in no uncertain terms for Jacobs and especially Evans.

“For me it was kind of different because I moved out for two-and-a-half years” Evans said. “I lived and breathed soccer for two-and-a-half years and I did the same thing with the Philadelphia Union. I did everything the same every day with my teammates and everyone pushed each other to the limit and created new limits for themselves. It was a different kind of … I don’t know setup I would say.”

“For those of us at nationals we were all coming from separate schools” Jacobs added with a difference in how his experience worked compared to the “brotherhood” Evans had. “We all didn’t play high school because it wasn’t allowed. But at nationals there really wasn’t any connection. It didn’t feel right.

“When my sophomore year came around and I made the decision to play for Bay I think it’s the best decision I’ve ever made for my soccer career.”

Together the two friends under Dougherty made regional semifinals two of the last three years before dropping a heartbreaker in the 2021 Division II state final something that leaves a desire of wanting to have accomplished more. At the same time each player couldn’t have achieved what they had without the other’s help and growing together.

The bond the two share on the same pitch was evident throughout the fall. It was a special sight to see with the over 30 years Dougherty has coached the Rockets.

“Without a doubt” Dougherty said detailing the various combinations of players to come through the Bay program over the years before turning back to his All-Americans. “You watch kids that just have it and have been blessed to watch it for years.”

“Ethan and Mills were on the tail end of those older guys coming in but it was the same thing. It was the perfect combination of amazing players and exceptional leaders on the field where they could dictate tempo flow tempo and control of a game from any position anywhere on the field. We spent a lot of time talking about communication and leadership over the past year and how to get people to follow you is not a matter of being loud enough or good enough.

“You have to be able to communicate it and that’s where I see the growth of these two young men over the past calendar year. They went from unbelievably talented players to amazing leaders. That is not an easy step or an easy transition and a lot of people just can’t transition to that step. I was just so pleased and proud of these two gentlemen for what they’ve done and how they’ve brought our program along especially this year.”

The chemistry the two developed all the way on a small rec field in the middle of town eventually blossomed after vastly different experiences. It traces all the way back to their younger days and the two of them making the last three years the best years of their lives.

“These past three years have changed me completely both as a person and as a player” Jacobs said with Evans in agreement.

“Obviously coming up with Mill we played on the same rec team. We’ve been friends since … I can’t even remember” he said with a light chuckle. “That chemistry is super important for us and that aspect doesn’t even have to be verbal. We can look at each other and know how to push the tempo and stuff like that and that’s what can lead a team to be great.”

The two both might even have a chance to go up against each other in college though friendships will be pushed aside if they end up going toe-to-toe.

“I think it’s going to bring the competitive sides out of both of us” Evans said. “At the end of the day when the game’s over we’re going to go back to being friends. But when we step on the field we’ll be playing for our schools and I think with how competitive we can both be and push each other.”

While Dougherty received degrees from Cleveland State and Bowling Green he demurred on what would happen with a head-to-head matchup.

“Whoever wins that’s the jersey I’ll wear” the coach joked drawing laughs from around the table. “So no matter what I’m on the winning end.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHA6Ly9jYXJpYmJlYW4ubG9vcG5ld3MuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvaGVyZXMtd2hhdC13YXMtcmVhbGx5LXNhaWQtYWJvdXQtc2ludC1tYWFydGVucy1uZXh0LWVsZWN0aW9uc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's what was really said about Sint Maarten's next elections | Loop Caribbean News,"Prime Minister of Sint Maarten and Minister of General Affairs Silveria Jacobs has clarified that recent reports stating that the Council of Ministers has made a decision to hold elections in November 2023 are incorrect and the statements made by the cabinet in this regard were misconstrued.

However manager Brian Snitker provided a promising update on one of the club’s injured relievers.

Pierce Johnson was placed on the 15-day injured list on May 4 with elbow inflammation. On Friday though the 33-year-old was scheduled to do some mound work as reported by Justin Toscano of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Pierce Johnson is doing well Brian Snitker said. He was scheduled to throw a touch-and-feel off the bullpen mound today.



No update on Tyler Matzek. He’s been shut down from throwing for a brief period. — Justin Toscano (@JustinCToscano) May 10 2024

Tyler Matzek was also placed on the 15-day injured list retroactive to May 5 with his own case of elbow inflammation. Snitker did not provide an update on his injury except that he had been shut down from throwing.

Hopefully each of them will recover well and get back to the pen in due time.

The old-time image of an anarchist that has long been fixed in popular imagination is of a guy with wild hair and a deranged smile holding a circular bomb with a lit fuse. Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman looked nothing like that. Photographs of them from more than a century ago show them to be quite proper and well dressed; they could have been any elegant couple decked out for a stroll along Fifth Avenue.

But Berkman and the better-known Goldman onetime lovers born in the Russian Empire were indeed anarchists believing in a society without leaders one rooted in an egalitarian spirit free of the top-down organization that has defined governance for oh only forever. Sure many anarchists were unruly: In their heyday roughly from 1880 to 1920 they went around blowing things up employing the dynamite invented by a Swedish gent Alfred Nobel whose name now graces the world’s most coveted peace prize.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1tYWZpZ2h0aW5nLmNvbS8yMDI0LzUvMTAvMjQxNTM3MjMvZGVtZXRyaW91cy1qb2huc29uLXJldmVhbHMtaG93LW11Y2gtbW9uZXktaGVzLW1hZGUtZnJvbS1lYS11ZmMtZ2FtZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Demetrious Johnson reveals how much money he's made from EA UFC games,"Demetrious Johnson didn’t make a king’s ransom from the EA UFC games but he’s happy with what he received.

A seemingly ever-present topic of conversation in the MMA world is the topic of fighter pay in the UFC. But while that conversation primarily focuses on fighters’ show money win money bonuses and pay-per-view points there are other instances that don’t immediately jump to mind like likeness rights. And while UFC is primarily a fight promotion the company also has a longstanding licensing deal with EA Games to produce the UFC video game series. So how does that work for the fighters?

Well Johnson recently described the entire thing on his YouTube channel.

“One day I’m at home I’m playing video games and I get an email stating that ‘Hey since your likeness is being used a lot in the video game we are sending you a check’” Johnson said. “Now the very first check I got for being in the UFC video game was $25000. A lot of you guys are like ‘That was it?’ Guys think about this $25000 to just be in a video game. I don’t think Ryu [or] Ken has ever gotten a check for $25000. [It’s] $25000 for not getting punched in the face $25000 for just being in a video game because you people love using me as a character. So I was ecstatic.

“How do they dictate how much money you’re going to get paid? I can’t dictate it. You guys actually dictate how much I get paid by how often you guys use me in the game. When you log onto your game let’s say you’re playing offline mode or you’re playing online mode each character you pick it does a little tick and sends the data to the mainframe computer. That’s how they keep track of it. ... They do it for all the games out there because they want to see what characters are being played the most and what game modes you like the most. They’re always tracking your data and keeping all the analytics.

“I think that’s fair. It’s based on your popularity in the game. So if everybody and their mom keeps playing me I will get a bigger check.”

Johnson is widely considered to be one of the greatest fighters in UFC history so it’s not surprising that he’s a popular character choice for fans. In fact Johnson was so popular that he also served as the cover athlete for a specialty edition of EA UFC 3 which “Mighty Mouse” explained came with a little extra money for him.

“So let’s fast forward: The next one that came out was UFC 3 and for this bad boy the next check that I ended up getting was $12500” Johnson said. “Now it’s a little bit lower but I was OK with that because the timeframe of the checks was coming every year or quarter. I wasn’t too worried about it because once again it’s free money just coming to me.

“Now after I did something after my Ray Borg fight they offered me the opportunity to be on the front cover. That’s when they came out with the Icon Edition with me on the front. ... So in order for me to be on the cover I signed an agreement to be on the front cover and with me signing I got a whopping $10000 — $10000 to be on the front cover and it’s pretty dope. I love every bit of it.”

There are currently five iterations of the EA Sports UFC titles with the most recent released this past October. Johnson has been in all of them aside from the first even after leaving the promotion in 2018. Johnson said he has yet to receive his check from the latest edition but for the three version of the game he has been in including his time as a cover athlete “Mighty Mouse” revealed his grand total of payouts comes to just under $75000.

“Let’s fast forward: UFC 4 comes out” Johnson said. “I leave the UFC I’m not part of the company anymore but my character is still in the game and you guys are playing as my character. The next check I get in the mail is another whopping $25000. For being in a game! And it’s absolutely amazing because to me it’s something where your likeness is being used and I think it’s cool where the UFC or EA keeps on paying the athletes for their likeness and that people are using me.

“Now after all that from the first iteration of me being in the game in 2014 all the way to 2024 the total money I have made is a whopping $72500. I think it’s absolutely amazing for me to make that type of money without getting punched in the face.

“Now I have not gotten a check yet for UFC 5 which I’m in the game. ... Obviously when you guys use me as a character and my popularity is still good I will also receive another check from EA or Zuffa or whoever the hell is in charge of the UFC now. So I think it’s pretty cool.”

Likeness rights in sports video games can be wide-ranging. For instance the NFL Players Association struck a deal with the Madden franchise that reportedly paid the players $500 million over a five-year extension while the NBA 2K deal was reportedly for $1.1 billion over seven years. Conversely EA Sports College Football 25 will reportedly only offer athletes featured in the game $600 and a copy of the game.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYWxtYmVhY2hwb3N0LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvcGdhLzIwMjQvMDUvMDkvd2h5LWR1c3Rpbi1qb2huc29uLXNheXMtbGl2LXBsYXllcnMtc2hvdWxkLWJlLXJld2FyZGVkLWluLXBnYS10b3VyLW1lcmdlci83MzYyOTg3NTAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Dustin Johnson says LIV players should be rewarded in PGA Tour merger,"Dustin Johnson has a completely different take on those who shunned the PGA Tour for LIV Golf and those who are being hailed as loyalists for remaining on the tour.

Speaking on the second second season of the Netflix series ""Full Swing"" Johnson believes those golfers who were handed tens and some hundreds of millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund are the ones who ""took the risk."" One reason is the criticism those golfers received from joining a league financed by a country with atrocious human rights violations.

Johnson who lives in Jupiter also wonders why those who remained on the tour — many turning down those multimillions — should be compensated if the two sides one day unite.

""No I don't"" Johnson said on the episode when asked whether PGA Tour players were owed compensation if LIV players returned to the tour.

""The guys that went to LIV we took a lot of criticism. We're the ones that took the risk for everything. So why should they be compensated? Obviously if this merger comes along there's gonna be a lot of guys who wish they would've signed.""

With no final deal since the framework agreement was announced 11 months ago one heavily discussed aspect is how PGA Tour players are rewarded and LIV golfers penalized for their decisions.

PGA Tour players are being promised very large sums of money through the enterprises' equity share plan. Large as in a reported $100 million for Tiger Woods $50 million for Rory McIlroy and $30 million for players like Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth according to the The Telegraph.

When it comes to legacy reputation and their safety Johnson is correct. These players have made sacrifices.

Paulina Gretzky Johnson's wife revealed that the couple received death threats after her husband joined LIV.

""People sending death threats and awful awful awful things"" she said. ""People were aggressive that’s for sure. But that’s when I shut it down for a little bit. I was like I don’t need to look at this. Everyone has an opinion on it. Fine.”

But financially … Jon Rahm's sacrifice will earn him a reported $550 million including bonuses for joining LIV while Johnson Phil Mickelson Bryson DeChambeau Brooks Koepka and Cam Smith reportedly all signed with LIV for more than $100 million.

And many others will earn tens of millions such as Tyrrell Hatton who reportedly signed for around $65 million.

Over the last twenty years the renowned ceramics studio has produced projects with over 500 artists including Nairy Baghramian John Baldessari Sarah Crowner Abraham Cruzvillegas Nicole Eisenman Mario Garcia Torres and Jonas Wood.

In conversation with the main exhibition the adjacent gallery will host a solo show of works by artist Eduardo Sarabia titled This Must Be The Place. Though born in Los Angeles Mr. Sarabia emigrated to Guadalajara in 2003 at the invitation of Cerámica Suro.

In a press release announcing the exhibitions DC Executive Director Carolina Alvarez-Mathies remarked “Dallas Contemporary is honored to host this selection from the collection of Marcela and José Noé Suro an exhibition that so beautifully describes the spirit of generosity and possibility that José Noé Suro has cultivated not only in his hometown of Guadalajara but here in Dallas as well through many creative collaborations.”

Both exhibitions will open on April 20 2023. Mr. Sarabia’s solo exhibition will close on August 27 2023 and the Cerámica Suro exhibition will close on December 31 2023.

In February 2023 the Dallas Museum of Art (DMA) will be the final venue to host Saints Sinners Lovers and Fools: 300 Years of Flemish Masterworks an exhibition organized by the Denver Art Museum in collaboration with The Phoebus Foundation. The exhibition drawn from the Foundation’s collection showcases more than 130 works from the Flanders region of Belgium spanning from the 1400s through the 1600s.

Dr. Nicole R. Myers the DMA’s interim chief curator and The Barbara Thomas Lemmon senior curator of European Art commented “We are thrilled to bring the Phoebus Foundation’s stunning collection of Flemish masterworks to our Dallas community. This period of production was a defining and pivotal moment not only in the development of medieval Renaissance and Baroque art but in the greater scheme of cultural scientific and political evolution in Europe. Stepping into this exhibition truly feels like you’re embarking on a journey through time. We’re excited for visitors to peer through this window to the past while also seeing reflections of their own ever-changing world.”

Saints Sinners Lovers and Fools: 300 Years of Flemish Masterworks will be on view in the DMA’s Chilton Gallery I from February 19 through June 25 2023.

Also debuting in February is the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth’s I’ll be Your Mirror: Art and the Digital Screen. Curated by Alison Hearst the group show brings together art spanning from 1969 to present day that features or is inspired by screen culture. A variety of mediums will be represented including painting sculpture video games digital art augmented reality and video.

With more than 25000-square-feet of gallery space dedicated to the exhibition this is the most in-depth show of its kind in the Southwest region. The exhibition will feature 51 artists including prominent national and international artists such as Nam June Paik Arthur Jafa Gretchen Bender and Andy Warhol as well as important Texas artists including Liss LaFleur Kristin Lucas and John Pomara.

I’ll be Your Mirror: Art and the Digital Screen will be on view from February 12 – April 30 2023.

In March the Amon Carter Museum of American Art will present Emancipation: The Unfinished Project of Liberation highlighting the perspectives of contemporary Black artists.

The show will feature commissioned and recent works by artists responding to John Quincy Adams Ward’s bronze sculpture The Freedman from the Carter’s collection.

Emancipation includes sculpture photography paper and textile works by Sadie Barnette Alfred Conteh Maya Freelon Hugh Hayden Letitia Huckaby Jeffrey Meris and Sable Elyse Smith. The Carter is pairing the contemporary works with Civil War materials to provide context and deepen visitors’ understanding of the history of representations of Blackness.

Environment America assessed the progress of six companies on their use of virgin fibers and indirect greenhouse-gas emissions. The group also looked at whether they obtained consent from Indigenous communities whose land is used for pulp supplies. It found most of the firms lacking either because they hadn’t made explicit promises to address those issues or because their plans didn’t go far enough.

“The industry has made progress but it still has a long way to go” report author Sammy Herdman said in an email. “Companies should prioritize providing consumers with sustainable products that don’t harm our forests.”

The group assigned grades from A through F based on its criteria. Walmart was given an F because it doesn’t disclose how many products are made with 100% recycled fiber or other non-virgin wood according to the report. In addition its goal to reduce indirect greenhouse-gas emissions isn’t as ambitious as what Environment America recommends and it has “no public policy relating to the free prior and informed consent of Indigenous communities.”

The other three companies given a failing grade for similar reasons were Costco Wholesale Corp. Amazon.com Inc. and privately held Georgia-Pacific which makes toilet-paper brand Quilted Northern.

P&G which received a D released a bamboo toilet paper product this year which the advocacy group said is a “step in the right direction.” But it said the Charmin manufacturer’s emissions could be improved.

In November another environmental group called on U.S. regulators to review P&G’s claims to investors about its wood-pulp sourcing policies. The consumer-goods giant issued a policy update earlier this year pledging to preserve forests “for generations to come.”

Kimberly-Clark Corp. got the best grade — a C — because it has already committed to cutting its use of “natural forest fibers” by 50% by 2025. However the Cottonelle maker doesn’t have an explicit policy on “informed consent” with Indigenous communities Environment America said adding that the company could also have a more ambitious emissions-reduction target.

In a response to questions about the report Georgia-Pacific which is owned by Koch Industries Inc. said it follows guidelines on forest protection and sustainable practices. The company said its suppliers are private companies that are approved by local governments — and Indigenous groups help to determine how these suppliers use the land. Georgia-Pacific is also working to reduce greenhouse gases by improving energy efficiency and using new technology the company said in an email.

Kimberly-Clark said it’s progressing toward its goal of sourcing 90% of its tissue fiber from “environmentally preferred sources” by 2025 with 87% coming from such sources in 2021. The company said it reduced its use of forest fibers by 34% in 2021 from its 2011 baseline and is “committed to unlocking further reductions through innovative new materials and technological solutions.” An increasing percentage of virgin wood fiber used by Kimberly-Clark is certified by the Forest Stewardship Council a nonprofit group that promotes responsible forestry the company said in an email. The FSC “applies the most rigorous criteria for the conservation of biodiversity and the protection of the rights of Indigenous communities” Kimberly-Clark said.

P&G said it has “comprehensive policies practices and investments” in order to “ensure no one has to choose between the products they use today and what they hope to preserve for tomorrow.” In an emailed statement P&G said it has strengthened its supplier policies and audits in the areas of human rights and forest protection.

The company said it received a score of A- for wood pulp in the CDP Forest Survey.

Walmart referred to its Project Gigaton climate plan which aims to “engage suppliers NGOs and other stakeholders in climate action with a goal to reduce or avoid one billion metric tons (a gigaton) of greenhouse gas emissions in the global value chain by 2030.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL21hcnktbW9ucm9lLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM4NDY5NjQz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mary Monroe Obituary (2022) - Jesup GA - Royal Funeral Home Inc. - Jesup,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/mary-monroe-obituary?id=38469643 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL21hcnktbW9ucm9lLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM4NDY5NjQz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oYXJ0Zm9yZGNvdXJhbnQvbmFtZS9nZW9yZ2UtbW9ycm93LW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM4NDY2Mzcx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,George Morrow Obituary (1936 - 2022) - South Windsor CT - Hartford Courant,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/hartfordcourant/name/george-morrow-obituary?id=38466371 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oYXJ0Zm9yZGNvdXJhbnQvbmFtZS9nZW9yZ2UtbW9ycm93LW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTM4NDY2Mzcx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,

What happened next?,"One day I was sitting on the Tube and saw this bright pink advert. I mouthed the word “Klarna” as I sat opposite it and wondered what it was for.

This was back in 2016 when no one knew the concept of buy now pay later. Previously spending largely meant handing over money instantly from your current account or paying for it in the future using a credit card that charged you extortionate interest rates.

But that all changed when Klarna offered up a third way – a way to shop now and worry about paying it off later. You paid in three instalments and as long as you did this you weren’t charged any interest. As someone who is more of a shopper than a saver Klarna was too appealing to resist for long.

And before I knew it it was my default form of payment. I wasn’t alone of course. Klarna’s tentacles have spread far and wide and now one in eight of us use it according to data from UK Finance the trade body for the banking industry.

Like most people I use Klarna for non-essential spends. In the past year I’ve used it on £1446 of items I may well not have bought had it not been invented.

£600 was spent on a sofa from Wayfair and the other £800ish was on clothes. Were we to factor in last December you would see the £60 I put on Klarna to pay for last year’s Christmas tree.

As we’re all feeling the strain of inflation my use of buy now pay later increasingly bugged me. It enabled my financial spontaneity and allowed me to spend beyond my means. In short it made my bad financial habits worse at a time when they needed to get better.

And so in November I came to a decision: I was going Klarna cold turkey for the month. I needed to see what life was like without it. The first week was fine: I tried not to look at ASOS (my drug of choice) and I avoided interacting with adverts for clothes companies by scrolling quickly past or not opening social media sites at all.

I didn’t find it too difficult in the first week and it felt good to know I wasn’t ‘wasting’ money on spontaneous purchases. I felt less guilty as I wasn’t buying items I would only wear once and that my bank balance wasn’t taking a (future) hammering as a result.

But then two weeks in a ping on my phone alerted me to ASOS’s ’20 per cent off everything’ sale. This caused a major wobble. The temptation was too much and I decided to have a browse.

As much as I wanted to fill my virtual basket with all of my many (many) saved items I tried to rein in my spending and opted for just one pair of Adidas leggings which to be fair I needed as my current pair are littered with holes.

Instinctively I went to check out with Klarna my default option but I stayed strong. Instead I forked out the £28 upfront feeling annoyed that the money had to be taken out of my account straight away (I’d got out of the habit of paying for something – shock horror – immediately.) But then the purchase would be the end if it – no surprise second or third instalment would come out of my account later.

But as the month wore on the challenge became harder and I was itching to browse for items online. I wanted to see if I could find a new outfit for my upcoming engagement party but reminded myself that I had bought several options last month that I still hadn’t paid off.

Things became harder still with the siren call of Black Friday and Cyber Monday (25 and 28 November).

I am usually a big advocate of the two shopping events – a time when I not only treat myself but also stock up on Christmas presents.

However this year without being able to pay later I found myself only opting for a small number of items mourning the thought of potentially hundreds of pounds coming out of my bank account at one time.

Although I could use my credit card this would also be a dangerous move as there is *cough* already a fair amount in there that needs paying off.

Here I am in an outfit that I paid for entirely using Klarna – just one of many I bought then forgot I hadn’t paid off in full (Grace Gausden)

By the end of the month although I found it a struggle I had managed to swerve Klarna all together. I think I saved around £200 over the month by not giving in to my impulses.

So how did my month change me? Well I am no longer so trigger-happy with the ‘Buy Now’ button; it has made me pause before making purchases deciding whether it was something I really wanted or needed.

I have to admit I have gone back to Klarna after my month-long detox but the relationship has altered.

I still have £125.99 outstanding to pay on it but that is for a mirror and rug I bought earlier this year to be paid off in instalments.

I will use continue to use Klarna but only for big-ticket items that are easier to pay in instalments as opposed to using it as an excuse to purchase mountains of clothes I don’t need.

Now I will be indulging in a spot of Boxing Day sales but for the first time in years will try to do so in cash – not with credit.",,,,,,,,,

I wasn't a fan of the Publix frosting on its own. Rachel Askinasi/Insider

Customers have a strong connection to the fluffy icing and fresh-tasting cake from Publix and I can totally see why.

When I cut into this cake I saw a four-layered yellow cake with three interior layers of buttercream. The cake was moist and held together while I picked up the full slice as one piece.

The first bite showed me why everyone loves this treat for special occasions. It tasted sweet in a natural way and had what I would call a medium density — it wasn't too heavy and rich but it didn't fall apart from being too airy. The flavor of the yellow layers was mildly sweet and rich with butter. If someone offered me a slice I would definitely be excited.

But I thought it smelled kind of strange when I first took the lid off. After tasting the buttercream frosting on its own I noticed that it had a lovely silky light whipped texture but I didn't think it tasted like frosting at all. It tasted artificial but not in the same sugary way as the Food Lion frosting.

As I expected the red balloon on top of the cake dyed my mouth the same way the blue coloring on the Food Lion cake had. But that's just part of the fun of eating food coloring.

While the frosting wasn't my favorite it did taste better when I ate it in conjunction with the cake layers. But since I'm someone who enjoys scooping frosting with my pinky finger and eating it on its own I don't think I would request this cake at my birthday party.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdvb2Rob3VzZWtlZXBpbmcuY29tL2hvbGlkYXlzL2NocmlzdG1hcy1pZGVhcy9hNDIyMTk0NjYva3JvZ2VyLWNocmlzdG1hcy1ob3Vycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Kroger Open on Christmas Day 2022? Kroger Holiday Hours,"Kroger supermarkets are all across the United States. So it makes sense that when you're looking for some last-minute Christmas items or you're wanting to get your grocery shopping done before you have to head back to work you'll be wanting to stop at a Kroger.

After all the stores are known for having everything you need from food to home goods to even a pharmacy. But since Christmas is a federal holiday and it just so happens to fall on a Sunday in 2022 there are a lot of stores that are closed.

Is Kroger open on Christmas Day 2022?

Kroger will not be open on December 25 2022. It's actually the only holiday where all locations close their doors (so Kroger will be open on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day).

(Marc Lester / ADN)

Beginning in January many Alaskans may no longer be able to go to Fred Meyer pharmacies to pick up their prescriptions.

That’s due to the announced termination of a pharmacy agreement set to end at the end of 2022 between Express Scripts and Kroger Fred Meyer’s parent company. Express Scripts is a pharmacy benefits manager a company that acts as an intermediary between many local pharmacies and major health insurance companies to handle reimbursements.

The split will impact thousands of Alaskans who have health insurance through companies that work with Express Scripts such as TRICARE Cigna and Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alaska among others.

Those affected include most Alaskans who signed up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace all military members and their families employees with federal contracts all Anchorage municipality employees and many more.

Experts say it will be hard to predict the full impact of the terminated agreement in Alaska and that it’s possible the two companies could still come to some kind of last-minute agreement before the end of the year.

“It is not unusual for there to be posturing between the two parties as they negotiate” Lori Wing-Heier director of the Alaska Division of Insurance said in an email. She said no contract termination had yet been registered with the state.

But pharmacists interviewed for this story worry that if no agreement is reached the impact could be significant in Alaska especially in smaller communities where pharmacy options are already limited and understaffed leading to long waits and patients being turned away in some cases.

The pharmacists say they anticipate confused customers and long wait times as thousands of prescriptions are transferred away from Fred Meyer to other local pharmacies that will need to step in to fill the gaps.

“This is definitely going to have ripple effects throughout the community” said Dan Nelson a pharmacy manager with Tanana Chiefs Conference.

Nelson and other pharmacists reached for this story also say that an announced merger between Kroger and Albertsons the company that owns Safeway and Carrs could further exacerbate the problem — the potential loss of access to Carrs and Safeway pharmacies as well could mean a dearth in pharmacy options for many Alaskans.

Questions of access

Kroger Family Medicine owns 13 Fred Meyer pharmacies around Alaska or just about 8% of all pharmacies around the state.

A spokesperson with Express Scripts said she couldn’t disclose how many Alaskans were serviced by the company.

“With this change the vast majority of our customers in Alaska will be able to continue to fill their prescriptions at their pharmacy” Justine Sessions a spokeswoman with Express Scripts said in an email.

[Many Alaska pharmacies are understaffed leading to sporadic hours and patients turned away]

Alaskans in the military are covered by TRICARE the health care provider for uniformed service members which uses Express Scripts for prescriptions.

“We believe there will be minimal impact other than the inconvenience of transferring the prescription to another pharmacy. While Kroger is opting to no longer be a part of the Tricare Network beneficiaries have other options within the area” Brandy Ostanik-Thornton public affairs officer with U.S. Army Alaska said in an email.

She included a link where military members and their families could use to find a nearby pharmacy.

Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alaska one of the state’s largest health insurers also sent a letter out to members this month about the split informing them what steps to take next.

Premera spokeswoman Amanda Lansford said that while the company is not involved in the negotiations it is “committed to ensuring our members have access to in-network pharmacies.”

Fred Meyer represents only 8% of pharmacies in Alaska Lansford said and every city with a Fred Meyer pharmacy also has one other in-network pharmacy Premera members can use.

While it’s true that Alaskans will have many other options for pharmacies besides Fred Meyer after the termination — Sessions said there were at least 135 others — smaller communities would still likely be affected by the split.

Navigating the changes

A reduction in the number of pharmacy options for patients has the potential to exacerbate staffing challenges and long waits for prescription caused by an existing pharmacist shortage in Alaska.

In Fairbanks the two Fred Meyers in town are often the busiest and most-staffed pharmacies in the city according to Nelson who helps coordinate the delivery of medications to the tribal consortium of the 42 Interior Alaska villages that make up Tanana Chiefs Conference.

He estimated that around a quarter of all Fairbanks residents were enrolled in a health insurance company that contracted with Express Scripts and relied on Fred Meyer to fulfill their prescriptions.

Nelson laid out what might happen to those Alaskans picking up a prescription at Fred Meyer after Jan. 1: First they would be quoted the cash price for their medication instead of the price that their insurance typically covers.

“Then they’re going to have a heart attack and need to pay that full cost up front” he said. Then they would have to manually submit a reimbursement to their insurance company which would probably be less than what they were expecting.

Meanwhile the workload for non-Kroger pharmacies in Fairbanks will likely increase by about 25% Nelson predicted causing backlogs in prescription transfers that translate to delayed wait times for patients.

The best way for Alaskans to switch pharmacies is to call the pharmacy they are switching to and say they have a prescription at Fred Meyer that they want to transfer Nelson said.

His advice to avoid lengthy delays for prescriptions: “Don’t wait until January to change pharmacies: be proactive change it now.”

Affected Alaskans have likely already received a letter from their health insurance company announcing the change. But Brandy Seignemartin executive director of the Alaska Pharmacists Association encouraged those who were unsure to call the number on the back of their health insurance card and ask questions.

She said her biggest priority over the coming weeks will be helping Alaskans figure out how to quickly navigate the potential changes to where they can access care.

“When patients lose their pharmacies it has an impact on patient health outcomes” Seignemartin said. “So making sure we can get patients support around where they can get their medications as quickly as possible is going to be incredibly important to make sure that there’s continuity of care.”

Long-brewing problems imperfect solutions

In letters from Express Scripts and the affected insurance companies many Alaskans have been offered an option to switch to an online pharmacy managed by Express Scripts at a slightly reduced cost as a way to offset the loss of access.

Alaska pharmacists reached for this story said they worried that online orders won’t work as well in Alaska as they do in other states due to lengthy distances extreme temperatures and other challenges related to the state’s remoteness and large swaths of communities not connected to the road system.

“My biggest concern is access” said Justin Ruffridge a Soldotna-based pharmacist.

“It’s not good health care for people to lose access to their pharmacies” Ruffridge said. “It’s not good health care for people to have to question whether or not their prescription is coming in the mail whether it’s going to be OK sitting outside in a freezing mailbox for the next four hours.”

According to Ruffridge and others the business practices of pharmacy benefits managers like Express Scripts — especially dismally low reimbursement rates — have led to the closures of many independent pharmacies.

“There’s only so little reimbursement you can accept until you can’t afford to safely staff your pharmacies anymore which creates so many workforce problems and other issues as well” Seignemartin said.

Ruffridge views Kroger’s decision as another example of the harm caused by pharmacy benefit managers.

“The more that these practices go on the more difficult it is for pharmacies to operate in local communities. And you’ll end up with essentially a pharmacy by mail” he said.

Nelson the Tanana Chiefs Conference pharmacy manager said he’s seen firsthand how difficult it can be for medications to be delivered by groups without experience shipping to rural Alaska from warehouses in the Lower 48.

He hears weekly from people whose medication didn’t arrive on time or is frozen or expired.

“I think there’s a lack of understanding of you know there’s not a road out to all these locations and it’s going to be put on a plane and a caravan and it’s going to be 50 below” he said.

As of late Monday lottery officials estimate Tuesday’s prize at $565 million — or more than $293 million if delivered in cash — after there were no lucky winners holding a ticket that matched all six numbers in the last drawing held on Friday.

Tuesday’s drawing will be held at 11 p.m. EST.

Tickets sold in California and Florida for an Oct. 14 drawing shared the last Mega Millions jackpot of $502 million. The lottery’s top prize has been building anew over 20 drawings held since then.

Lottery officials say there have been 11 winning jackpots of $500 million or more since Mega Millions began in 2002. The record Mega Millions jackpot is more than $1.5 billion won in 2018 and a jackpot surpassing $1.3 billion was won in Illinois in July.

The largest U.S. lottery jackpot ever won was $2.04 billion in November. The winner bought the lucky Powerball ticket in Southern California.

Now L3Harris is bidding even higher.

At long last Aerojet Rocketdyne's (AJRD) two-year-long attempt to sell itself may be drawing to a close. Last week defense company L3Harris Technologies (LHX 0.05%) announced it will buy Aerojet and take the rocket-maker in-house. And the most amazing part of the news is this:

L3 is going to pay more to acquire Aerojet than Lockheed Martin (LMT 0.10%) wanted to pay early last year.

Military history

Let's rewind a bit. Early in 2021 Lockheed Martin -- the world's biggest defense company -- announced its plans to get even bigger by buying Aerojet which manufactures rocket engines for everything from spaceships to cruise missiles. In doing so Lockheed would add new revenue streams to its defense business (which earns 10.5% operating profit margins according to S&P Global Market Intelligence) and also give Lockheed a leg up in space (profit margin: 9.3%).

There was just one problem: The Federal Trade Commission decided that Lockheed Martin was already quite big enough all by itself (thank you very much) and nixed the deal in February 2022. And so with Lockheed's $4.4 billion acquisition offer dead as a proverbial doornail Aerojet Rocketdyne set about trying to find itself a new buyer.

This shouldn't have been an easy task. As I explained last month Aerojet has a lot of problems that make it an unattractive target for acquisition (or indeed stock investment). In addition to stagnant sales declining profits and negative free cash flow one of the company's premier products of the last few years -- its AR1 rocket engine -- has no obvious market. Its most obvious potential customer United Launch Alliance decided to buy its rocket engines from another supplier.

On top of all that Aerojet stock looks very expensive at a P/E ratio of 47.

Let the bidding commence

Nevertheless several potential bidders emerged for Aerojet with Reuters reporting that companies ranging from private equity houses to defense companies like Textron to conglomerates like General Electric might all be interested in acquiring the company. Ultimately though L3Harris came out on top with a bid of $58 per share -- cash -- valuing Aerojet at $4.7 billion inclusive of net debt.

That bid by the way was $2 a share more than Lockheed had bid two years earlier. It's also a fair bit more than I suspect Aerojet Rocketdyne stock is worth.

How crazy is L3Harris?

To understand why this $2 difference matters consider that in early 2021 the Federal Reserve's targeted interest rate was basically zero -- versus 4.5% today -- making it easy to borrow money for acquisitions at attractive rates. Today however interest rates are soaring and cash is king.

Yet L3Harris is still spending like there's no tomorrow.

This is particularly important in light of the fact that while L3Harris is promising to pay $4.7 billion for Aerojet L3Harris doesn't actually have $4.7 billion. To the contrary S&P Global data show that L3Harris has less than $530 million in the bank versus $7.8 billion in debt. And so as L3Harris admits it will need to take on new debt in order to finance its purchase of Aerojet.

Result: Even if interest rates don't rise any higher (hint: interest rates are definitely going higher) this implies at least a 60% increase in interest expense for L3Harris going forward as total debt approaches $12.5 billion. This implies annual interest costs of $435 million eating up 17% of operating profit. And if you assume that lenders will charge more for loans to more heavily indebted companies then interest expense will probably rise even more than that.

The upshot for investors

Granted L3Harris may be happy to incur the extra expense hoping as it will that booming demand for rocket motors for new weapons systems -- a hot commodity since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war -- will help to grow sales at Aerojet's defense business. If the new revenue from Aerojet is sufficiently profitable it may end up offsetting much of the added interest expense for L3Harris.

Failing that though I'm afraid what we're looking at here is basically a stock (L3Harris) that costs an expensive 37 times trailing earnings borrowing a lot of cash in order to buy a stock that costs an even more expensive 47 times earnings. That seems like a bad bargain to me.",,,,,,,,,,,,

“Sexy baby” (a possible “30 Rock” reference?) sent social media into meme overdrive but the most telling part was Swift’s description of herself as a “monster on the hill.” It is fitting: Over the past 16 years Swift 33 has become so famous that her mere presence is simply all-consuming the rare figure that manages to dominate pop culture at all times. During a time in which so many millennial music stars struggle to sustain momentum in their careers she maintains an unbreakable hold on our increasingly fractured world — and its discourse — in a way that almost no one else can.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZ29vZG1lbnByb2plY3QuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVkLWNvbnRlbnQvc3dpZnRpZXMtd2VsY29tZS10by10aGUtYW50aS1tb25vcG9seS1tb3ZlbWVudC_SAV9odHRwczovL2dvb2RtZW5wcm9qZWN0LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlZC1jb250ZW50L3N3aWZ0aWVzLXdlbGNvbWUtdG8tdGhlLWFudGktbW9ub3BvbHktbW92ZW1lbnQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Swifties Welcome to the Anti-Monopoly Movement,"By Bella DeVaan

The anti-monopoly movement is having a moment. Gone are the days of associating evil market dominance with Standard Oil or Carnegie Steel Bill Gates’ petulance during deposition or how it feels to desperately mortgage Marvin Gardens because you landed at the hotel on Park Place.

As now-Federal Trade Commission (FTC) chair Lina Khan asserted five years ago in her seminal work “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox” our government’s outdated enforcement standards “fail[ed] to register” monopolistic harm. Since then millions more Americans have been awakened to the sinister power of monopolies in our economy – and the exciting political opportunities to rein them in.

Last week legions of new anti-monopolists were born. They have enormous potential to change the game: shrewd social media skills undying loyalty and encyclopedic knowledge. They’re Taylor Swift’s superfans – and they just might be the reason that the government breaks up Ticketmaster.

The Swifties – as Swift’s stans are affectionately nicknamed – experienced the destructive power of the live event and ticketing monopoly firsthand. Hoping to procure pre-sale tickets to their favorite pop star’s upcoming tour millions of fans waited in endless e-queues only to be hit with sky-high ticket prices and exorbitant fees – if they were able to snag a ticket at all.

“Ticket prices may fluctuate upon demand at any time” read an ominous warning on the Ticketmaster website. And they did: Due to their “dynamic pricing” system which vaults ticket costs to a maximum market rate fans reported buying tickets for thousands upon thousands of dollars not including hefty fees and prices spiked even higher on the secondary resale market. On StubHub for example ticket listings reached upwards of $95000.

Finally Ticketmaster threw in the towel and canceled subsequent presale windows. Their site crashed thousands of times. It was absolute mayhem – and fans had no other option but to endure it the kind of undignified customer experience caused only by an unchecked monopoly.

Ultimately the Swifties got results.

Hours after Taylor Swift released a statement apologizing to the fans for the bungled presale and chastising Ticketmaster for incapably handling demand the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced it has launched an investigation of Live Nation Entertainment’s abuse of market power. While their work wasn’t prompted by Swift reported David McCabe and Ben Sisario in the New York Times Swifties’ wave of discontent was overwhelming enough to warrant the Department’s public disclosure. Immediately the company bragging about a record-smashing 2022 (“benefitting” from “fee bearing tickets”) saw its stock plummet.

How did we get here? When it comes to antitrust issues the American government has essentially been asleep at the wheel allowing Ticketmaster’s monopoly to crush its competition for over a decade.

As Chokepoint Capitalism author Cory Doctorow explained to More Perfect Union Ticketmaster’s dominant control of the live show ticketing market had a natural customer in Live Nation’s concert promoting business which managed an impressive portfolio of major artists and live music venues.

In 2010 the two entities merged into Live Nation Entertainment to suppress their rivalry – a process waved through by the Obama administration’s consolidation-friendly Department of Justice. The company was subject to a relatively weak consent decree which asked the merged companies to not use their live venue dominance to expand their ticketing capacity. But it’s been easy to intimidate their naysayers and flout guidelines ever since.

Put simply the merger created a monster subordinating all parties in the live event life cycle from ticket acquisition to performance.

“Ticketmaster bullies venues into not working with their competitors” concluded Doctorow. “They bully smaller artists by denying them management. They bully big artists by controlling their ticket prices and letting their fans down. And they bully their customers into paying exorbitant prices for tickets not only by enabling resellers but by collecting massive fees on every ticket those resellers sell.”

Even Swift an aspiring billionaire and private jet power-user has no choice but to bend the knee to the ticketing monopoly often an exclusive partner at her massive preferred venues.

Greg Maffei chairman of the monopoly’s parent group – and head of Liberty Media a media conglomerate with Republican ties – blamed the service’s lag time on Taylor’s popularity. “Ticketmaster will twist any situation to protect its market power over live events” noted the American Economic Liberties Project. (It’s time to mention that Maffei took home $47 million from Liberty Media in 2021 and is personally worth hundreds of millions like Swift herself.)

Soaring ticket prices are not entirely the artist’s fault for their popularity. Even as Taylor Swift’s music is of the money-printing monocultural variety – incentivizing “dynamic pricing” to the highest degree – she’s still a worker exploited by and beholden to an overarching system. As Live Nation and Ticketmaster can force artists to work with them and make a killing on their sale and resale fees less popular or well resourced artists are uniquely harmed by the business model without other streams of income.

“Corporations are extracting the maximum capital from artists’ labor and they’re not sharing it anymore” said Doctorow.

Ticketmaster’s unsustainable market dominance has long been understood. Well before the Taylor Swift fiasco a coalition of research organizations and artists collectives launched the Break Up Ticketmaster campaign – asking the DOJ to “investigate and unwind” the live events monopoly. The campaign quickly gained ground generating tens of thousands of signatures on an advocacy letter.

Pro-breakup legislators also harnessed the news cycle calling on the Department of Justice to investigate the abusive ticketing monopoly.

“Consumers deserve better than this anti-hero behavior” tweeted Senator Richard Blumenthal punning off a song from Swift’s latest album Midnights.

And on MSNBC Senate Antitrust Committee chair Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) promised a Senate hearing on Ticketmaster’s market power and insufficient consent decree in the coming year. She expressed political interest in “put[ting] the Taylor Swift fans right on antitrust” as their ticketing experience was “a story of a monopoly gone wild.” Her bills with Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Mike Lee (R-UT) aim to facilitate antitrust enforcement with new filing funding and state empowerment rules.

State lawmakers too seized the opportunity to criticize consolidation. After all Swifties are spread across the country and party lines. The Attorney General of Tennessee – home to the “angriest Swifties” – opened an investigation into Ticketmaster’s misconduct. And in New York state Senator Mike Gianaris called attention to his 21st Century Anti-Trust Act which would “hold [Ticketmaster] accountable for manipulating the ticket market to bleed concert-goers.”

For his part President Biden recently directed his administration to “reduce or eliminate” junk fees like Ticketmasters’ infamous extra charges which sometimes total up to 78 percent of the cost of a ticket. And he’s appointed a passel of pioneering antitrust enforcers – like New Brandeisian icon and FTC chair Lina Khan DOJ Antitrust lead Jonathan Kanter and former economic advisor Tim Wu – who are dedicated to bucking Robert Bork’s inert “consumer welfare standard” overhauling the state’s merger guidelines and appropriately disciplining monopolistic harm in the contemporary economy. Biden also signed a robust competition-oriented executive order in his first months in the Oval Office.

The President’s paradigm shift comes not a moment too soon. Monopolies aren’t just disfiguring our economy or our political processes. They are capable of stripping everything for parts – even our arts and culture cornerstones of democratic society that should be unequivocally protected from the incursions of greedy corporations.

Swifties understand this. And they experience the villainy of monopolies across the board – through the high price of a tight seat on a plane home from college in the improbability of a solid career in journalism in their skyrocketing monthly rent or in the marginalization of their small e-commerce business.

So present day monopolists steel yourselves and remember: When you provoke a superfan they’ll come for you.

Now L3Harris is bidding even higher.

At long last Aerojet Rocketdyne's (AJRD) two-year-long attempt to sell itself may be drawing to a close. Last week defense company L3Harris Technologies (LHX 0.05%) announced it will buy Aerojet and take the rocket-maker in-house. And the most amazing part of the news is this:

L3 is going to pay more to acquire Aerojet than Lockheed Martin (LMT 0.10%) wanted to pay early last year.

Military history

Let's rewind a bit. Early in 2021 Lockheed Martin -- the world's biggest defense company -- announced its plans to get even bigger by buying Aerojet which manufactures rocket engines for everything from spaceships to cruise missiles. In doing so Lockheed would add new revenue streams to its defense business (which earns 10.5% operating profit margins according to S&P Global Market Intelligence) and also give Lockheed a leg up in space (profit margin: 9.3%).

There was just one problem: The Federal Trade Commission decided that Lockheed Martin was already quite big enough all by itself (thank you very much) and nixed the deal in February 2022. And so with Lockheed's $4.4 billion acquisition offer dead as a proverbial doornail Aerojet Rocketdyne set about trying to find itself a new buyer.

This shouldn't have been an easy task. As I explained last month Aerojet has a lot of problems that make it an unattractive target for acquisition (or indeed stock investment). In addition to stagnant sales declining profits and negative free cash flow one of the company's premier products of the last few years -- its AR1 rocket engine -- has no obvious market. Its most obvious potential customer United Launch Alliance decided to buy its rocket engines from another supplier.

On top of all that Aerojet stock looks very expensive at a P/E ratio of 47.

Let the bidding commence

Nevertheless several potential bidders emerged for Aerojet with Reuters reporting that companies ranging from private equity houses to defense companies like Textron to conglomerates like General Electric might all be interested in acquiring the company. Ultimately though L3Harris came out on top with a bid of $58 per share -- cash -- valuing Aerojet at $4.7 billion inclusive of net debt.

That bid by the way was $2 a share more than Lockheed had bid two years earlier. It's also a fair bit more than I suspect Aerojet Rocketdyne stock is worth.

How crazy is L3Harris?

To understand why this $2 difference matters consider that in early 2021 the Federal Reserve's targeted interest rate was basically zero -- versus 4.5% today -- making it easy to borrow money for acquisitions at attractive rates. Today however interest rates are soaring and cash is king.

Yet L3Harris is still spending like there's no tomorrow.

This is particularly important in light of the fact that while L3Harris is promising to pay $4.7 billion for Aerojet L3Harris doesn't actually have $4.7 billion. To the contrary S&P Global data show that L3Harris has less than $530 million in the bank versus $7.8 billion in debt. And so as L3Harris admits it will need to take on new debt in order to finance its purchase of Aerojet.

Result: Even if interest rates don't rise any higher (hint: interest rates are definitely going higher) this implies at least a 60% increase in interest expense for L3Harris going forward as total debt approaches $12.5 billion. This implies annual interest costs of $435 million eating up 17% of operating profit. And if you assume that lenders will charge more for loans to more heavily indebted companies then interest expense will probably rise even more than that.

The upshot for investors

Granted L3Harris may be happy to incur the extra expense hoping as it will that booming demand for rocket motors for new weapons systems -- a hot commodity since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war -- will help to grow sales at Aerojet's defense business. If the new revenue from Aerojet is sufficiently profitable it may end up offsetting much of the added interest expense for L3Harris.

Failing that though I'm afraid what we're looking at here is basically a stock (L3Harris) that costs an expensive 37 times trailing earnings borrowing a lot of cash in order to buy a stock that costs an even more expensive 47 times earnings. That seems like a bad bargain to me.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmZvcmNlLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kuY29tL25ld3MvbG9ja2hlZWQtbWFydGluLWFkdmFuY2UtZjM1LXByb2R1Y3Rpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lockheed Martin wins $1.05bn contract to advance F-35 production,"A formation of 42 F-35A Lightning II on the flight line during a routine readiness exercise at Eielson Air Force Base Alaska.

The company is expected to complete the work by January 2024.

The Naval Air Systems Command Patuxent River is managing this contract.

In another development Pratt & Whitney a Raytheon Technologies’ company has received additional $75m in fundings for its F135 Engine Core Upgrade (ECU) programme for the F-35 aircraft.

The funds have been provided under Fiscal Year 2023 Omnibus Appropriations Bill and represents congressional contribution for the US DoD’s F135 engine modernisation effort.

The company claimed that ECU is the only F-35 propulsion modernisation alternative for all F-35 variants.

Pratt & Whitney F135 programmes vice president Jen Latka said: “Thanks to the support we have received from Congress with leadership from Chairwoman DeLauro upgraded engine will be ready for fielding starting in 2028.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzb2Zpc3JhZWwuY29tL2lzcmFlbC1ncm91bmRzLTExLWYtMzUtamV0cy1hZnRlci11cy1maWdodGVyLWNyYXNoZXMtZHVyaW5nLXRlc3Qv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGltZXNvZmlzcmFlbC5jb20vaXNyYWVsLWdyb3VuZHMtMTEtZi0zNS1qZXRzLWFmdGVyLXVzLWZpZ2h0ZXItY3Jhc2hlcy1kdXJpbmctdGVzdC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Israel grounds 11 F-35 jets after US fighter crashes during test,"The Israeli Air Force on Sunday said it had grounded 11 of its advanced F-35 stealth jets after a similar model of the plane crashed during a test flight in the United States earlier this month.

On December 15 an F-35B crashed on a runway at a US Navy base in Texas reportedly during a test of its hovering capabilities being conducted by Lockheed Martin. The pilot ejected safely and was unharmed.

The Israeli military on Sunday said 11 of its F-35I jets would be checked for a similar issue to the one that apparently caused the crash before being returned to service following recommendations by the F-35 Joint Program Office.

“From the findings and the information given it was found that these planes require a dedicated inspection in order to rule out the possibility of a repeated malfunction in the Israeli array” the Israel Defense Forces said.

The F-35I the Israeli version of the F-35 is based on the F-35A which has a conventional takeoff and landing system. The B variant used by the US Marine Corps and other navies allows for short takeoff and vertical landing on aircraft carriers.

Earlier this year the IAF grounded its entire F-35 fleet over a problem with its ejector seats which was discovered by the US. The jets were returned to service after a week after being examined for the issue.

The fifth-generation F-35 has been lauded as a “game-changer” by the military not only for its offensive and stealth capabilities but for its ability to connect its systems with other aircraft and form an information-sharing network.

Israel has agreed to purchase at least 50 F-35 fighter jets from the US defense contractor Lockheed Martin. So far 36 aircraft have been delivered and the remaining planes are slated to arrive in batches of twos and threes until 2024.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhaGVyYWxkLmNvbS92aWV3LnBocD91ZD0yMDIyMTIyNTAwMDEwNdIBOGh0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYWhlcmFsZC5jb20vYW1wL3ZpZXcucGhwP3VkPTIwMjIxMjI1MDAwMTA1?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is KAI on Hanwha’s mind after DSME acquisition?,"Hanwha Group’s planned acquisition of Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering the nation’s No. 2 shipbuilder is once again fueling speculation over its possible attempt to take over Korea Aerospace Industries the sole aircraft maker here that would complete the conglomerate’s vision to become the Korean version of Lockheed Martin.

The rumor of Hanwha looking into buying the state-run Export-Import Bank of Korea’s 26.41 percent stake in KAI began late September after it signed a conditional memorandum of understanding to acquire DSME’s controlling stake at 49.3 percent for 2 trillion won ($1.6 billion).

According to the rumored message that went viral among investors Hanwha initially wanted to take over DSME’s certain business only but the government demanded a total buyout. Hanwha then pledged to do so only if a KAI acquisition would be made available by the government. The two sides reached an agreement. Hanwha was now expected to begin the takeover process of KAI after it acquires DSME this year.

All three parties denied the rumor. Hanwha said it has not reviewed such a buyout plan. KAI released a rare statement to refute a rumored report that said officials from Hanwha and KAI met multiple times to discuss the practically state-owned KAI’s privatization. Eximbank Chairman and President Yoon Hee-sung made it clear that there were no plans to sell the bank’s stake in KAI during an audit at the National Assembly on Oct. 19.

However now that the DSME deal has been signed on Dec. 16 industry sources say the rumor has come back again.

“Although Hanwha still has to go through the administrative processes and receive approvals from the Korean and foreign fair trade authorities it looks like there won’t be many obstacles. Once the acquisition is completed Hanwha is probably going to think about what it will look for to take the next big leap” an analyst at a local securities firm told The Korea Herald on condition of anonymity.

Pointing out that Hanwha’s all defense businesses had been put together under Hanwha Aerospace in July the analyst said the DSME acquisition will make the group a total defense firm covering the land the sea and the air.

“Getting KAI’s technology of fighter jets helicopters and aerospace could help Hanwha reach its goal of becoming the Korean Lockheed Martin” the analyst added.

As Hanwha prepares for leadership succession from Chairman Kim Seung-youn to his eldest son Kim Dong-kwan the group’s vice chairman and CEO of Hanwha Solutions another industry source said it would make sense for Hanwha to go after KAI to boost the apparent heir’s climb to the chairman position in the long term.

“If you think about Korea’s space industry shifting gears from the government-led area to the private-oriented sector Hanwha is the country’s leading aerospace company. Chairman Kim’s eldest son is leading the group-wide committee to nurture its space businesses” said the source who also wished to be unnamed.

The source however noted that Hanwha’s priority right now is to face the tough task of normalizing DSME’s continued losses and reviving the financial status of the shipbuilder that has logged an accumulative sales loss of almost 1.2 trillion won over the first three quarters this year.

“Hanwha is already spending 2 trillion won for the acquisition of DSME. It will need more investment to normalize the shipbuilder’s financial structure. Eximbank’s stake in KAI is worth about 1.25 trillion won. It appears difficult for Hanwha to raise enough amount of cash in the near future” the source said.

According to a Hanwha official the conglomerate does not have an interest in buying Eximbank’s stake in KAI adding that the rumor has been around for one to two years already. Hanwha is the seventh-largest family-run conglomerate in Korea with a total market capitalization estimated at about 80 trillion won. With a possible acquisition of KAI it could outpace steel giant Posco to become the sixth-largest business group.

KAI the country’s sole fighter jet manufacturer has also maintained a firm stance to turn down any possibilities of handing over its ownership.

Kang Goo-young CEO of KAI said the company should not be bought out by Hanwha and added that he believed it should not be acquired by any private firms in a press conference with local reporters held at the KAI headquarters in South Gyeongsang Province on Dec. 20.

“The weapons KAI makes account for 60 percent of the aerial weapons system of the Air Force the Navy and the Army. The figure will go up to 70 percent or higher in 10 years. It is very risky to entrust private companies with core forces that have an essential impact on the outcome of the war” said Kang.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9icmVha2luZy1uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtNzI1NzYz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Eleven F-35 fighters grounded after US crash - Israel News,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.jpost.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /breaking-news/article-725763 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000212272F16F0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9icmVha2luZy1uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtNzI1NzYz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

A new story will be revealed daily until New Year’s Day.

10. YSU’s Tressel has rough final year.

9. Trumbull Energy Center becoming reality in Lordstown.

8. Gunfire rings out in very public places in 2022.

7. Historic “Yellow House” moved to new home.

HOWLAND — The oldest house in Howland reached its new home in the early morning of Aug. 14 as the Ohio Department of Transportation Ohio Edison FirstEnergy Howland police and fire and others teamed up to help make the move possible.

Stein House Movers moved the historic home commonly referred to as the “Yellow House” from its former site on state Route 46 across from Lowe’s to a new spot off South Street across from Howland Middle School. The move took just two hours and 15 minutes well shorter than earlier predictions of up to five hours.

Cindee Mines with the Howland Historical Society said plans for 2023 include working on needed restoration mostly inside the house and having a walkway installed in memory of society Vice President Warner Taiclet who died of pancreatic cancer in March. Mines said he was instrumental in getting the house opened as a museum and the walkway may be called “Warner’s Walk.”

“Warner really wanted to save the house so we want to have his name there” she said.

Mines said the occupancy permit the society will have will allow the house to be opened and show the public what work needs to be done.

The house was taken from the hillside off state Route 46 where it had been located for more than a century and then transported up the nearby ramp traveling east onto state Route 82. The truck hauling the oversize load made an intended U-turn at the intersection of Howland Wilson Road and then headed west to the exit ramp from Route 82 onto Route 46.

The house then traveled less than a mile along Route 46 before turning left onto South Street. Power lines in the area of Route 46 and the intersection of South and Willow streets were taken down and put back up as the house moved along its route.

REASON FOR MOVE

The historic home’s relocation was necessary because its former location off Route 46 was adjacent to the site of an intersection where a major road project is planned by ODO. The intersection will be expanded in a project commonly referred to as the “diverging diamond project” intended to realign traffic flow at routes 46 and 82 to improve safety and lessen the number of crashes in the area.

Howland police Chief Nick Roberts who was at South Street for the day of the move said he was pleased with the move noting it went well with no unexpected issues. Roberts said six Howland police officers assisted with watching intersections that were closed to traffic.

Residents in the area had lined some of the route with hopes of catching a glimpse of the early morning spectacle. Some watched from the lawn at Howland Middle School and others set up folding chairs in their driveways or stood on nearby sidewalks.

COOPERATION

The move had been considered for more than a year but was pursued in earnest over the summer.

Originally the home was targeted for demolition but Howland Historical Society members worked with ODOT and the home’s owner local Realtor Jason Altobelli donated it to the Howland Historical Society.

Mines said ODOT covered costs for the move — between $375000 to $400000 — with the society responsible for anything over that amount.

Mary Jane Vennitti historical society president said she was pleased with how the move went noting saving the house has been discussed since 2018 when ODOT first announced the project.

Vennitti said the house will be restored to how it looked in the 1830s.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2JmaS0xMC1iaWdnZXN0LXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tYXdhcmRzLTEyMzAwMDk0Ni5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The BFI's 10 Biggest Production Awards Of 2022: Alice Lowe's Romcom 'Timestalker' & Matt Smith Pic 'Starve Acre' Top ...,"Here’s our annual rundown of the 10 largest production awards given out by the British Film Institute’s Film Fund in 2022.

The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints. The three companies deny any wrongdoing. “These voluntary agreements reflect no finding of improper conduct and reaffirm the wireless industry’s longstanding commitment to clarity and integrity in advertising so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products and services that best suit them” Nick Ludlum the senior vice president of the CTIA the trade group representing the carriers tells The Verge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvcmFyZS1taWNoYWVsLWpvcmRhbi1jYXJkLWNvdWxkLWZldGNoLTVtLWF1Y3Rpb24ta2VuLWdvbGRpbi1yZXZlYWxzLTEwMC1iZXN0LWNvbGxlY3RpYmxlc9IBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3hidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL3JhcmUtbWljaGFlbC1qb3JkYW4tY2FyZC1jb3VsZC1mZXRjaC01bS1hdWN0aW9uLWtlbi1nb2xkaW4tcmV2ZWFscy0xMDAtYmVzdC1jb2xsZWN0aWJsZXMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rare Michael Jordan card could fetch $5M at auction: Ken Goldin reveals '100 best collectibles',"Goldin Auction’s second annual Goldin 100 event displays the rarest and most valuable collectibles of the year.

(AP Photo/Seth Perlman)

PLYMOUTH TOWNSHIP Mich. – A 3-year reconstruction project on M-14 and I-96 began this weekend with road closures between Sheldon and Newburgh roads in Wayne County.

Construction will include rebuilding the freeway with new concrete pavement from Sheldon Road to Newburgh Road including the ramps at the M-14/I-96/I-275 interchange.

The work will also include maintenance on 17 bridges and the rebuilding of the I-275 Metro Trail along M-14 from Edward Hines Drive to I-275.

This summer construction will include bridge work and shoulder widening. Next year eastbound M-14/I-96 will be rebuilt. The westbound lanes will be rebuilt in 2026.

Reconstruction is expected to cost $139 million.

Road closures

Starting at 9 a.m. Friday May 10 and lasting around one month Northville Road will be closed over M-14 for bridge work.

Starting at 8 p.m. on Friday May 10 and lasting until 5 a.m. on Monday May 13 eastbound and westbound M-14/I-96 will be closed between Sheldon Road and I-275. The following ramps will also be closed:

Southbound I-275 traffic can go to westbound I-94 then take northbound US-23 to eastbound or westbound M-14.

Eastbound M-14/I-96 traffic will be detoured in Ann Arbor using southbound US-23 to eastbound I-94 then northbound I-275 to eastbound I-96.

Local traffic will be able to take eastbound M-14 up to Sheldon Road.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50YWxsYWhhc3NlZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC8yMDI0LzA1LzEwL2ZhbXUtdG9sZC1ibHVlcHJpbnQtMTVtLW5vdC1uZWVkZWQtZm9yLWJyYWdnLWFmdGVyLTIzN20tZG9uYXRpb24vNzM2MzU4MTcwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FAMU told Blueprint $15M not needed for Bragg after $237M donation,"Two days after Florida A&M University announced it received an eye-popping $237 million donation President Larry Robinson notified the Blueprint board that the university was no longer interested in pursuing $15 million in additional funding for Bragg Stadium improvements.

The Blueprint board made up of all 12 city and county commissioners approved $10 million for major renovations to FAMU's football stadium in 2020. At the time the stadium was in such disrepair it was unclear whether home games would be played there in the 2021 season.

Last year FAMU asked Blueprint for $15 million more for Bragg improvements. The board in February denied the university's request for immediate funding but voted to explore the use of economic development funds rather than infrastructure dollars for the project.

Robinson in a Monday letter to Leon County Commissioner Carolyn Cummings who chairs the Blueprint board thanked the agency for the $10 million and consideration of the additional $15 million.

""However at this time we are withdrawing our request for additional assistance from the Blueprint Intergovernmental Agency for Bragg Memorial Stadium"" Robinson wrote in the letter obtained by the Democrat. ""We look forward to continuing to work with you the Blueprint Board of Directors and Blueprint staff in other ways going forward.""

The letter was dated two days after FAMU's spring graduation ceremony and surprise announcement of the purported nine-figure stock contribution from Gregory Gerami CEO of Batterson Farms Corp a little-known hemp company based in Austin Texas. The gift would have been the biggest ever for FAMU or any historically Black college or university.

But on Thursday FAMU put Gerami's donation on hold amid mounting questions about it. Gerami has a history of philanthropic overtures to other universities including Coastal Carolina University and the University of Texas at Austin that never materialized according to reporting by the Myrtle Beach Sun News.

It's unclear whether FAMU's decision to backtrack on its most recent Blueprint request was directly related to Gerami's would-be donation. The gift agreement between Gerami and the Isaac Batterson Family 7th Trust stipulated that at least $100 million would go toward FAMU athletics.

A FAMU spokesperson was not available for comment on late Thursday on whether the now-paused donation would prompt the university to reconsider its abandoned request for $15 million in Blueprint funds.

Utilities have been one of the hottest topics of 2022 as the Russian invasion of Ukraine ushered in a wave of inflation especially in Europe. In fact in the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) energy inflation stood at 28.1% on average. The bulk of this inflation was contributed by 13 countries all of which saw energy inflation soar above a painful 30%. The largest inflation was in Italy where energy prices soared by a whopping 71% annually in October.

The U.S on the other hand saw relatively 'muted' energy inflation that stood at just 17.3% in the same month. This was the third lowest among all G7 economies and the primary reason that Americans remained better off was that they do not rely on Russian energy imports. However this does not mean that prices are low as natural gas and coal shortages have nevertheless pushed up retail utility prices to five year highs especially as record natural gas prices ended up driving the cost of producing electricity. For America these price increases are unavoidable since the largest portion (35.4%) of electricity is generated via natural gas. The price volatility itself has expedited the shift to renewable energy among utilities according to the IEA.

However these prices which end up in massive profits for power producers do have a silver lining. According to Bloomberg these companies are selling excess capacity at lower prices - rates that coal and gas producers cannot match. This according to analysts can end up putting the coal companies out of business and reducing emissions in the long term. The latest in the U.S. energy and utility sector these days is Winter Storm Elliott which has disrupted oil and gas output - which in turn has led to higher prices and power blackouts all over the country. U.S. benchmark oil prices jumped to $79.56 a barrel while power prices soared to $3700 per megawatt hour. Some oil companies that suffered from the reduced output are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC).

Today we will look at which companies are the largest when it comes to providing electricity and gas to Americans. Some largest U.S. utilities are Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO).

Utilities have been one of the hottest topics of 2022 as the Russian invasion of Ukraine ushered in a wave of inflation especially in Europe. In fact in the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) energy inflation stood at 28.1% on average. The bulk of this inflation was contributed by 13 countries all of which saw energy inflation soar above a painful 30%. The largest inflation was in Italy where energy prices soared by a whopping 71% annually in October.

The U.S on the other hand saw relatively 'muted' energy inflation that stood at just 17.3% in the same month. This was the third lowest among all G7 economies and the primary reason that Americans remained better off was that they do not rely on Russian energy imports. However this does not mean that prices are low as natural gas and coal shortages have nevertheless pushed up retail utility prices to five year highs especially as record natural gas prices ended up driving the cost of producing electricity. For America these price increases are unavoidable since the largest portion (35.4%) of electricity is generated via natural gas. The price volatility itself has expedited the shift to renewable energy among utilities according to the IEA.

However these prices which end up in massive profits for power producers do have a silver lining. According to Bloomberg these companies are selling excess capacity at lower prices - rates that coal and gas producers cannot match. This according to analysts can end up putting the coal companies out of business and reducing emissions in the long term. The latest in the U.S. energy and utility sector these days is Winter Storm Elliott which has disrupted oil and gas output - which in turn has led to higher prices and power blackouts all over the country. U.S. benchmark oil prices jumped to $79.56 a barrel while power prices soared to $3700 per megawatt hour. Some oil companies that suffered from the reduced output are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC).

Today we will look at which companies are the largest when it comes to providing electricity and gas to Americans. Some largest U.S. utilities are Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO).

If you’re cruising from Miami you’ll want to arrive in the city the night before your cruise begins and book a pre-cruise hotel stay.

Booking a hotel can be daunting as it’s easy to be overwhelmed by hundreds of options. Plus if you’re unfamiliar with Miami you’ll want to make sure you pick a hotel in a nice location.

To make your hotel planning process easier we’ve compiled a list of some of the best hotels in Miami. These hotels were recommended to us by Royal Caribbean Blog fans on our message boards or by personal experience our own cruises.

Here’s our list of the best Miami hotels near the cruise port.

Where to stay near the Port of Miami

We don’t recommend picking a hotel based solely on how close it is to the cruise port. You will take a taxi Uber or shuttle to the cruise port anyway so whether the hotel is 2 miles or 5 miles away from the port is irrelevant.

Instead pick a hotel based on what you’re interested in doing while in Miami. If you are looking forward to exploring South Beach consider staying at a boutique hotel near the oceanfront. If your flight doesn’t land in Miami until 11PM on the other hand staying at a hotel near the airport is a better choice.

In addition don’t select a hotel based on whether or not it offers shuttles from the hotel to the cruise port. Here’s why:

Let's say you’re traveling with a group of four people and a shuttle from your hotel to the cruise port is $10 per person. You will spend $40 total to reach the cruise terminal. A Lyft or Uber on the other hand may only cost around $10-15 dollars total from downtown Miami to the cruise terminal as it is priced per ride instead of per person.

Keeping this in mind our hotel recommendations are based in three areas of Miami: downtown South Beach and near the airport.

Best hotels in Downtown Miami

Downtown Miami is close to the cruise terminal yet still offers plenty of ways to kick off your cruise vacation. From walking the waterfront marinas to visiting museums bars and restaurants it’s an exciting place to spend the night before your cruise.

The U.S. embassy in Pakistan has warned about a possible terrorist attack against American citizens at the Marriott Hotel here in the country's capital and prohibited American staff from visiting the five-star facility an official statement said.

The statement was issued by the embassy on Sunday two days after a suicide bombing in Islamabad killed a policeman.

“The U.S. government is aware of information that unknown individuals are possibly plotting to attack Americans at the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad sometime during the holidays” it said.

“Effective immediately the Embassy in Islamabad is prohibiting all American staff from visiting Islamabad’s Marriott Hotel"" the statement said.

The embassy also directed that as Islamabad has been placed on a 'Red Alert' citing security concerns while banning all public gatherings all mission personnel have been urged to refrain from non-essential and unofficial travel in the capital throughout the holiday season.

It asked the U.S. nationals to exercise vigilance at events and places of worship and avoid locations with large crowds while reviewing personal security plans.

The advisory comes after the latest attack in Islamabad and an uptick in countryside attacks by the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terror group.

The TTP has stepped up attacks on security forces since November when they ended a months-long cease-fire with the Pakistan government.

One police officer and two suspected militants including a woman of the dreaded Pakistani Taliban outfit were killed in the suicide attack here on December 23 prompting authorities in Pakistan to issue a ""red alert"" across the federal capital.

According to national data Pakistan has recorded 420 terrorist attacks since August 2021 when the Taliban took over Afghanistan. In the last three months alone the TTP has claimed responsibility for 141 attacks.

At least 54 people were killed and several others injured when a dumper truck laden with explosives was detonated in front of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad’s red zone area on September 20 2008."

This paid piece is sponsored by Marsh McLennan Agency (MMA) Dakotas.

For Steve Vlk the key to dealing with stress while building a successful organization is to find balance. As CEO of the Marsh McLennan Agency Dakotas offices Vlk sees the effects of stress on himself his leadership team and his colleagues.

Years ago working with a high level of stress resulted in a serious health issue for Vlk. The incident was a wake-up call that helped him become aware of his triggers and more disciplined about carving out time daily to relieve stress.

As the CEO for MMA’s Sioux Falls and Fargo offices Steve Vlk oversees a team of more than 180 employees for nearly 7000 clients in business insurance employee health and benefits and private client services. Vlk’s greatest passion is developing the talent and culture of MMA because he believes what an organization does for its team reflects on what the organization does for its clients.

When he feels overwhelmed by a problem or needs to disengage from a situation he often takes a walk around the office to connect with colleagues. “Talking to somebody asking what their world is about takes my mind completely out of the stressor” he said.

Today Vlk is disciplined about disengaging striving to unplug when he’s away from work and choosing to live a more balanced life. And this commitment serves as an example to others in the organization.

In the 2022 Executive Stress Study MMA collected input from business leaders about how stress affects them and their employees. The results were not surprising but they paint a meaningful picture:

One-third work more than 50 hours a week.

49 percent say stress impacts personal and family life.

40 percent say they have health issues as a result of stress.

Ability to take time off and detach from work ranked lowest in satisfaction.

Nine out of 10 are stressed about recruiting and retaining talent.

88 percent said workplace morale contributed to their stress level.

For Vlk an important aspect of dealing with stress and other pressures is creating a culture that reflects the company’s values.

“I think about our culture more than I think about our business” he said. “Eighty percent of our business is doing what we say we can do for others. If we do that right we are energized to do our best for our clients.”

He adds that many conversations with the company’s leadership team are focused on retention and supporting employees. “If we grow our talent as passionately as we work to grow our business we will be successful.”

Vlk strives to create a culture that is reflective of the organization’s values. He calls his leadership style “followership” a concept based on the idea that leaders work side by side with their teams to accomplish goals in a way that is meaningful and fun.

He adds that followership is about being transparent vulnerable and passionate about who you are and what you’re doing. It also requires being willing to make mistakes and learn from them and understanding people are human beings who have lives outside of work.

When team members come to him in times of stress Vlk strives to help them find balance between work responsibilities and life priorities. He reminds them they aren’t alone and asks what he personally can take off their plate to help.

“I think the biggest thing is helping them understand that what we do is meaningful but it is also something we will give them grace on. They feel pressures and they are working toward perfectionism but they’re human” he said.

“At the end of the day it’s just listening and showing them you really care.”

What a year to run a business! An unprovoked war triggers a global energy crisis the worst inflation in decades threatens to derail the global economy and geopolitical forces push even harder for a rolling back of globalization.

Corporate leaders can’t expect a respite in 2023. Inflation may be showing signs of easing but high interest rates energy shortages and residual pandemic supply-chain issues are likely to slow global growth to 2.7% in 2023 from 3.2% in 2022 according to the International Monetary Fund.

Businesses already bruised by the pandemic need to prepare for the next round of challenges and opportunities by trying new things and seeing what works.

Research Plan Experiment

Businesses need to be nimble prepared and willing to experiment in 2023. Now is the time to review what worked this year and what risks could arise next year from macro and micro trends. Some are universal — a changing workforce access to capital climate change supply chain bottlenecks — but others are industry-specific.

Companies should ramp up their data collection and analysis to better understand their customers and colleagues. What products are customers likely to abandon if they have to choose between higher energy costs and groceries? Data can help provide answers.

Business leaders also need to understand their people. Do your employees have the skills they need or are you about to have a brain drain as experienced managers retire? What benefits do they value and what are they willing to give up? Use the data to build best- and worst-case scenarios. That way business is ready whether it’s to relocate a factory or acquire a competitor shrink a product line or provide new benefits.

Interest Rates

Businesses and consumers had grown accustomed to low interest rates and easy access to credit. But that disappeared in 2022 as central banks raised rates to tame inflation. Capital in 2023 will be harder to get and cost more than in the recent past when lenders would provide cash for a good idea without a product or overwhelming proof that it could become a money-making business.

Companies will now need a solid track record and business plan to get cash. But tight credit also could lead to more acquisitions as businesses collapse or seek mergers.

Transition plans that articulate the long-term value of a low-carbon business — and explain the cost of inaction — may help executives walk the line of differing stakeholder expectations.

Add Links to the Supply Chain

While many of the pandemic-era bottlenecks have cleared lots haven’t and protectionism is creating shortages and pushing up prices. Companies need to identify these and other potential supply-chain risks whether they could come from geopolitical tensions or severe weather shuttering a plant.

A growing number of companies are trying to avoid these challenges by diversifying suppliers factory locations and shipping strategies. Companies are now prioritizing security access and stability but are taking cost and friction into account by building more time into projects to ensure that plans are realistic.

Embrace Your New Team

Despite economic weakness business will continue to face a war for talent especially as experienced baby boomers the youngest of whom are 60 continue to retire. Business needs to adjust — and quickly — to Gen Z. These digital natives will account for 30% of the workforce by 2030. Born between 1997 and 2012 they have very different expectations about work from older generations.

The pandemic trauma left them more focused on personal health and less on traditional careers. They expect far more than remote work and appropriate pay. They want benefits that align with their focus on holistic health and opportunities to grow at their own pace. Companies should experiment with different hybrid options to see what works best for their culture. Many are successfully using job sharing flexible hours and four-day work weeks to attract and retain talent.

Digital Assets Are Here to Stay

2022 gave us the most brutal of crypto winters but CEOs should not write off digital assets. The sector shows real promise of useful innovations and the underlying distributed ledger technology continues to gain ground in real world applications such as the European Investment Bank’s recent 100 million-euro bond issued on a permissioned blockchain. In financial markets this will translate to the “tokenization” of stocks bonds and other assets bringing major efficiencies and reducing liquidity needs and operational risks.

Meanwhile digital currencies will assist in the increasing digitization of the economy including in the metaverse with central bank digital currencies private sector stablecoins and bank-issued tokenized deposits all playing a role. There is also strong potential for decentralized finance (DeFi) to eliminate expensive and time-consuming human-centric processes although it will be challenging to ensure DeFi solutions are truly safe.

The spectacular disasters of 2022 — principally the collapses of crypto exchange FTX and the Terra/Luna stablecoin platform — and their ripple effects underline the need for guardrails to protect consumers investors the financial system and the wider economy. Fortunately policymakers are in the process of designing laws regulations and supervisory approaches appropriate for the digital assets sector.

More Climate Pressure

Company leaders will need to make tradeoffs as on top of current economic challenges they face climate-related pressure from multiple angles. This includes employees consumers and regulators who are often pushing for faster progress and increased transparency and a spectrum of shareholder views from the climate-committed to those who think corporates should stick to purely focusing on the bottom line.

Developing detailed transition plans could help provide stakeholders comfort that executives are getting it right. The clock is ticking. About three-quarters of consumers say they want businesses to act on climate change according to a recent Oliver Wyman Forum survey of those in the United States United Kingdom and Brazil.

Government pressure also is growing with several committed to mandatory external disclosures. Earlier this year the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission proposed a mandate for public businesses to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions while more than 1300 of the largest U.K. companies have to disclose climate-related financial information including transition plans as of April 2022.

Transition plans that articulate the long-term value of a low-carbon business — and explain the cost of inaction — may help executives walk the line of differing stakeholder expectations.

Companies will need to make tradeoffs as they face these and other challenges with careful consideration of climate change and China’s shifting COVID policies. But they can also think of this as a time to experiment to try new strategies and to question long-held assumptions.

According to Mastercard SpendingPulseTM U.S. retail sales excluding automotive increased 7.6% year-over-year this holiday season running from November 1 through December 24. Mastercard SpendingPulse measures in-store and online retail sales across all forms of payment and is not adjusted for inflation.

“This holiday retail season looked different than years past” said Steve Sadove senior advisor for Mastercard and former CEO and Chairman of Saks Incorporated. “Retailers discounted heavily but consumers diversified their holiday spending to accommodate rising prices and an appetite for experiences and festive gatherings post-pandemic.”

Key trends this holiday season included:

E-commerce shoppers ‘add to cart’: Online sales grew 10.6% compared to the same period last year the preliminary insights show. This holiday season e-commerce made up 21.6% of total retail sales up from 20.9% in 2021 and 20.6% in 2020. The channel continues to experience elevated growth as consumers prioritize convenience and availability of discounts.

Weekend shopping reigns supreme: Black Friday sustains its title as the top spending day of the 2022 holiday season up +12% year-over-year excluding automotive. This was followed closely by Saturdays in December.

Ringing in the holidays in restaurants: Building on the ongoing demand for experiences in-person dining continued to show strong momentum with restaurants up 15.1% YOY. From gatherings with co-workers to dinners out with friends and family the festive season brought consumers out for the holidays.

“Inflation altered the way U.S. consumers approached their holiday shopping – from hunting for the best deals to making trade-offs that stretched gift-giving budgets” said Michelle Meyer North America Chief Economist Mastercard Economics Institute. “Consumers and retailers navigated the season well displaying resilience amid increasing economic pressures.”

Derivative Litigation1 is the latest example of how the Delaware Supreme Court’s watershed 2014 decision in Kahn v. M & F Worldwide Corp. (MFW)2 has been applied to new and different transaction structures involving a controlling stockholder.

MFW

In MFW the Delaware Supreme Court addressed which standard of review should apply to a controlling stockholder “squeeze-out” merger conditioned upfront on approval by both a properly empowered independent committee and an informed uncoerced majority-of-the-minority vote. The Court concluded that in this limited category of controller mergers “where the controller voluntarily relinquishes its control—such that the negotiation and approval process replicate those that characterize a third-party merger” the deferential business judgment standard of review could apply.3

Specifically a claim is subject to the business judgment standard of review if six prerequisites designed to protect the rights of the minority are present. Those prerequisites now commonly known as the MFW factors are:

the controller conditions the procession of the transaction on the approval of both a special committee and a majority of the minority stockholders ab initio; the special committee is independent; the special committee is empowered to freely select its own advisers and to say no definitively; the special committee meets its duty of care in negotiating a fair price; the vote of the minority is informed; and there is no coercion of the minority.

In the years since the Delaware Court of Chancery and the Delaware Supreme Court have articulated the contours of the MFW requirements.

For example in 2018 the Delaware Supreme Court explained in Flood v. Synutra International Inc. that in order to satisfy MFW’s ab initio prong a controller must condition a transaction on the approval of both an MFW-compliant special committee of independent directors and a majority-of-the-minority stockholder vote before economic negotiations begin.4

Then in Salladay v. Lev the Court of Chancery offered further clarification explaining that the ab initio prong of MFW “requires the committee’s empowerment prior to ‘substantive economic negotiations’ which include valuation and price discussions if such discussions ‘set the field of play for the economic negotiations to come.’”5

In addition Delaware courts have expanded the application of MFW to a number of other transactional contexts:

In In re EZCorp Inc. Consulting Agreement Derivative Litigation Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster pointed out that MFW might apply to a broad range of transactions in which a controlling stockholder extracts a non-ratable benefit. 6

In 2017 in In re Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. Stockholder Litigation Vice Chancellor Joseph R. Slights III applied MFW to a transaction in which a controller allegedly extracted disparate consideration from the transaction not shared with the common stockholders. 7

Later in 2017 in IRA Trust FBO Bobbie Ahmed v. Crane Chancellor Andre G. Bouchard applied MFW to a stock reclassification remarking that there was “no principled basis on which to conclude that the dual protections in the MFW framework should apply to squeeze-out mergers but not to other forms of controller transactions.” 8

In Tornetta v. Musk Vice Chancellor Slights applied MFW beyond “transformational” transactions to other corporate decisions involving controlling stockholders explaining that non-extraordinary transactions such as compensation decisions could be subject to business judgment review by following the procedures set forth in MFW.9

Match Group

Recently Vice Chancellor Morgan T. Zurn applied MFW to a “multi-step reverse spinoff” in Match Group dismissing breach of fiduciary duty claims after finding the controlling stockholder “reverse spinoff” complied with MFW’s dual protections and thus earned business judgment review.

IAC/InterActiveCorp (Old IAC or Controller) controlled Match Group Inc. (Old Match). In 2019 in a series of transactions (the Separation) Old IAC separated its dating businesses (i.e. Match.com and other websites) and some debt obligations (the Exchangeables) from the rest of its business. The Separation was accomplished by a transaction agreement dated December 19 2019. In the Separation Old IAC formed a subsidiary and spun its other businesses off to that subsidiary IAC/Interactive Corp (New IAC). So divested Old IAC held the Exchangeables and a stake in Old Match. Old IAC reclassified its two classes of high-vote and publicly traded stock into one class of common stock and became known as MatchGroup Inc. (NewMatch). The reclassification decreased IAC’s voting control in New Match. Then Old Match merged with and into a New Match merger subsidiary; in that merger minority Old Match stockholders received New Match stock. The merger subsidiary survived as a New Match subsidiary and Old Match ceased to exist.

In the subsequent litigation the court pointed out that “it [was] undisputed that the reverse spinoff was an interested transaction in which a controller obtained a nonratable benefit at the expense of the minority presumptively subject to review under the exacting entire fairness standard.” Thus the central dispute before the court was whether the “reverse spinoff” satisfied MFW’s prerequisites. Because the plaintiff did not dispute the existence of the special committee or the uncoerced majority-of-the-minority vote the court focused on MFW factors (2) through (5).

First regarding the special committee’s independence the court found that just one of the three committee members lacked independence because he relied on the Controller or its affiliates as his primary employment for two decades and he made at least $58 million from those relationships. However the court declined to find that this board member infected or dominated the other two committee members.

Second the court concluded that the special committee was sufficiently empowered to choose its own advisers and say no.

Third the court rejected the plaintiff’s three duty of care arguments that the committee (1) had a “controlled mindset” and negotiated poorly; (2) hired a conflicted financial advisor; and (3) structured the Separation to extinguish derivative claims.

Finally applying the materiality standard the court determined that the minority vote on the Separation was fully informed. Because the Separation satisfied all MFW prerequisites and the plaintiff did not even attempt to allege a claim for waste the court dismissed the plaintiff’s fiduciary claim.

With each new application of MFW the Delaware courts offer “incentive for controllers to embrace the procedural approach most favorable to minority investors with the incentive of obtaining the protection of the business judgment rule standard of review.”10

Takeaways

Delaware courts continue to embrace the expansion of MFW beyond the squeeze-out merger context to include a variety of circumstances in which a controller receives a non-ratable benefit.

Controllers and directors of controlled companies should consider the use of MFW in varying contexts.

Controllers and directors should be mindful to ensure compliance with each MFW factor including the ab initio requirement as failure to satisfy even one factor would preclude dismissal at the pleading stage.

During the December 25 episode of the MBC singing competition four contestants moved forward in their quest to challenge the reigning champion for the throne.

Spoilers

In the first match-up of Round 2 Little Match Boy took the stage with a mellifluous cover of Monday Kiz’s “White Snow.”

After watching his performance the panelists took turns trying to figure out who Little Match Boy might be. Lee Yoon Seok wondered if Little Match Boy was a talented sub-vocalist in a vocal group while 2AM’s Jeong Jinwoon noted “Little Match Boy has a singing style that was used a lot by male idols between 2010 and 2014. So I wondered if he might be a [fellow idol] that promoted at the same time that I did [with 2AM].”

Meanwhile GREE guessed that Little Match Boy was a member of iKON leading 2NE1’s Sandara Park to wonder out loud “[Could it be] Jinhwan?”

However although the audience was charmed by Little Match Boy’s gentle tone his opponent ultimately won the round—leaving him behind to take off his mask and reveal that he was Jaeyun the leader and main vocalist of boy group TO1 (formerly known as TOO).

Jaeyun then shared that his goal for his appearance on “The King of Mask Singer” had been to get yelled at by Kim Gura.

“Ever since I was little I grew up watching many of Kim Gura’s TV shows” explained Jaeyun “and I always felt that there was a certain warmth hidden in the way he yells at people. So I wanted to experience that warmth for myself.”

After the episode aired Jaeyun posted a mirror selfie of himself backstage with his mask on TO1’s official Twitter account.

Read our wrap of all the action and watch the highlights in the player above!

Group A

Sam Kerr's Chelsea ensured a first-place finish in the group after beating Lydia Williams' Paris Saint-Germain 2-0 at Stamford Bridge.

A tight first-half tussle saw the Blues go into the break one goal up with Kerr picking the ball up just outside the box and finishing in the top corner past Sarah Bouhaddi.

Chelsea started the second-half right where they left off with the home side pouncing on a poor ball off from the back and Kerr turning provider for Lauren James.

James added a third after the hour-mark making the task of PSG beating them by two goals to leapfrog them unreachable as the Blues won 3-0 to PSG.

Group C

Steph Catley and Caitlin Foord's Arsenal finished first in their group with a dominant 9-1 win over Zürich with Foord finding the back of the net twice and bagging two assists in the win.

Frida Maanum opened the scoring with a superb free-kick before Foord doubled the advantage soon after. Foord then set up Mannum for her second at the half-hour mark and Stina Blackstenius made it four just before the break.

The second half started in a similar fashion with Maanum completing her hat trick and then Blackstenius made it 6-0. Zürich clawed a goal back from the spot with Foord then restoring the six-goal advantage after picking up a poor back pass from the Zürich defence.

Catley played her part in one goal winning a penalty kick after making a bursting run into the box and sending a cross in that met the hand of a Zürich defender. Captain Kim Little stepped up to slot the penalty.

Foord set up Mana Iwabuchi for the Gunners' ninth of the evening ensuring they finished the group in 1st place.

In other group action Ellie Carpenter's reigning UWCL champions Lyon booked the last spot in the quarter-finals with a narrow 0-0 win against Juventus.

Going into the final matchday Lyon knew they would go through if they avoided defeat against Juventus. A string of saves from former Lyon goalkeeper Pauline Peyraud-Magnin kept the reigning champions at bay denying Eugénie Le Sommer and Delphine Cascarino from opening the scoring.



Lyon qualifies second in the group behind Arsenal and will face the first-place team from the other groups in the quarter-finals.

Group D

Lastly Teagan Micah's FC Rosengård went down 6-0 to Barcelona at Camp Nou going down fighting to the Spanish giants in their last UWCL game of the season.

Rosengård went into the final matchday of the group stage unable to progress to the next round with Micah not appearing in the fixture.

Three goals in either half to Barca helped the former champions qualify first in the group."

Wearing No. 66 David DeCastro’s and Alan Faneca’s old numbers McCormick told reporters he’s fully aware of the legacy he’s replacing. At least in number.

“I have heard a little bit about it” he told reporters via Steelers.com when asked about his jersey digits. “I heard I got some big shoes to fill. And that’s super exciting.”

McCormick clearly isn’t backing away from the expectations. More similar to Troy Fautanu DeCastro was the team’s first-round pick in 2012 going lower in the draft than projections and the last West Coast college prospect the team had taken in the first round prior to Fautanu. After battling injury as a rookie DeCastro turned into one of the NFL’s best guards a six-time Pro Bowler and two-time All-Pro before ankle problems shortened his career. Faneca came before both of them a first round pick and Hall of Famer even if his call to Canton took longer than it should’ve.

A punishing run blocker with tons of experience McCormick didn’t get his phone call until early on Day 3 the team’s fourth round pick. While McCormick will keep his goals high expectations out of the gate are lower than they were for DeCastro. Pittsburgh’s starting guards of James Daniels and Isaac Seumalo are set in stone entering the spring meaning McCormick is set to begin the year as a backup.

But o-line depth is valuable and can be quickly tested. Pittsburgh has been incredibly fortunate to avoid serious or multiple offensive line injuries the past two seasons but sheer law of averages suggests that luck will run out. That could push McCormick into a role sooner than expected.

“I’m ready to do whatever it takes to get on the field” he said. “I’ll play either guard spot center whatever it takes. I just want to help this organization in any way I can.”

That could include reps at center. McCormick noted he was the backup center in college and had South Dakota State’s starter gotten hurt he would’ve shifted over. Pittsburgh worked him out as such shortly before the draft and though Zach Frazier’s selection makes him a clear favorite to start the Steelers like to make their backups as versatile as possible. Friday McCormick played right guard and the Steelers will likely have him work at guard this spring before considering center come training camp.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gvbmV3cy9jYXNleS1nb2VzLWFmdGVyLW1jY29ybWljay1vbi1jb25uZWN0aWN1dC1yZXNpZGVuY3kv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sen.

The video posted on December 17th shows off the location’s automated drive-thru and an empty lobby with a couple of lonely ordering kiosks. Comments feature the usual mix of outrage cheering and sarcasm.

For its part McDonald’s has been publishing its own videos and blog posts about the new restaurant since the beginning of December. The video below shows off the unique features of the concept store and how it makes life for food delivery drivers and on-the-go customers easier:

The new location run by second-generation McDonald’s franchisee Keith Vanecek includes two drive-thrus including one targeted at digital order customers called the Order Ahead lane. The Order Ahead lane utilizes a rotating vertical lift that brings the order from above and drops it onto a conveyor belt. From there the conveyor belt shuttles the order to the customer who picks it up through the window.

While it’s a bit reminiscent of the Taco Bell ‘dumbwaiter’ delivery chute unveiled earlier this year it looks like the McDonald’s Order Ahead pickup is more akin to a second bank-teller window in that the customers’ order is sent across to the customer and not -as is the case with the Taco Bell concept – put into the delivery chute from overhead by an employee working on the second level.

Whatever the mechanics Micky D’s Order Ahead window is yet another signal that the big QSRs are beginning to embrace designs with multiple pickup points at a single location to avoid the order logjam that comes with a typical drive-thru design that zippers multiple order lanes into a single pickup lane.

Inside the store in addition to kiosks there’s a mobile order pickup shelving installation where customers can take and go their orders.

The new concept is another example of how QSRs are continuing to rethink the design of their locations as a larger share of their business goes through delivery and app-generated delivery. While this is the only McDonald’s location with these innovation concepts the company has made it clear they plan to roll out ideas that they determine could benefit customers in other locations as part of their ‘Accelerate the Arches’ growth strategy.

With all of its research and development a new item must be a reflection of what thousands of recipe test tasters prior to us must have declared “This is it!”

So no surprises here: the Smoky BLT Quarter Pounder — QPC for short — and the Oreo Fudge McFlurry should be a sure thing.

Danny Mills of Ruddy and Dean in St. George served as an arbiter of taste on the subject. On a recent trip to McDonald’s at Forest Avenue and Broadway he gave the two items a whirl.

Now before delivering judgement on the 770 calorie thing let’s reflect on the QPC itself. It was first introduced to the U.S. market in 1971. The modern patty on which the sandwich is based is a fresh quarter pound of meat and relaunched in the spring of 2018. I was there when the company gave a sneak peek at the Delancey Street McDonald’s in Manhattan.

Lessons learned from being in the kitchen of that busy McDonald’s are many. Primarily the raw QPC burgers are meticulously managed from the production to the trucking (monitored for proper temperature control) to the refrigerated storage in every McDonald’s outfit. Also the QPC must be delivered to the customer within one minute otherwise it’s supposed to be tossed according to the McD’s staff at the Delancy Street operation.

Starting with the QPC the meal is a sure thing. But about that smokiness and BLT treatment of the QPC: it’s half-hearted. The applewood bacon slices offer little to the combination except some bit of brine and more calories. Roma tomatoes as Mills pointed out could be more “Roma-ree.”

Yet by the time a perfectly toasted seeded bun hugs the sandwich’s components and sauce everything on it melds together pleasantly. Thanks to the quarter pound patty and its perfect amount of cheese it all works.

Did we need the pork off-season tomatoes and sauce? Meh — maybe not. Still at $6.09 we rated it about a 7 on a scale of 10.

On a cool note the Oreo Fudge McFlurry is a good schtick. It could be more fudge-y but the base vanilla McFlurry-ness is delicious thing says Mills. What really proved admirable in eating the treat — its packaging and Sundae spoon with a hefty handle. That shows respect for the food at hand. So in this case McDonald’s subtly built on perfection and we gave it around a 7 as well.

As fleeting as is the Golden Arches’ McRib special so are these two specials. We look forward to the test kitchens’ next experiments with two already winning items.

The location is in the Dallas-Forth Worth Metroplex in Fort Worth Texas. Machines do nearly everything there from taking orders to delivering food.

""When you step inside the test restaurant concept you’ll notice it’s considerably smaller than a traditional McDonald’s restaurant in the U.S. Why? The features – inside and outside – are geared toward customers who are planning to dine at home or on the go"" McDonald's said in .

""Inside the restaurant there’s a delivery pick-up room for couriers to retrieve orders quickly and conveniently. There are also kiosks where customers can place their orders to go and a pick-up shelf for orders. Outside the restaurant there are several parking spaces dedicated to curbside order pick-up as well as designated parking spaces for delivery drivers.""

The hope is that the streamlined design will allow human employees to concentrate more on order speed and accuracy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcG9ydHNrZWVkYS5jb20vcG9wLWN1bHR1cmUvaXQtbG9va3Mtc2FkLWxpZmVsZXNzLWZvcnQtd29ydGgtZnVsbHktYXV0b21hdGVkLW1jZG9uYWxkLXMtb3V0bGV0LXNwYXJrcy1vbmxpbmUtY3JpdGljaXNt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"""It looks so sad and lifeless"": Fort Worth fully automated McDonald's outlet sparks online criticism","American fast-food chain McDonald's has sparked online criticism after it opened its first almost fully automated restaurant in Fort Worth Texas.

The famed fast-food brand is currently testing out an outlet where customers can order their food via an app or a kiosk and pick it without coming into any human contact. Since there are no tables or seating arrangements customers are expected to grab their food and leave.

The restaurant in Fort Worth Texas also has a conveyor belt for drive-thru customers to get their food delivered to their vehicle after they enter a code following the purchase of food items.

Twitter reacts to McDonald's first automated restaurant

After Texas' almost fully automated McDonald's opened its doors to customers the Twitterati criticized the brand's new tech move. Several users pointed out that with this new move many potential employees would lose the opportunity to work thus increasing unemployment.

Meanwhile others simply mocked the brand noting that instead of increasing their hourly wages to $25 McDonald's removed all human labor and made the place automated.

McDonald's new test is to improve efficiency

The nearly fully automated McDonald's outlet is just functional in one place at Fort Worth Texas.

According to a statement obtained by the Guardian a spokesperson for the brand stated that the outlet is not fully automated and employs a team that is comparable to that of a traditional fast food outlet.

The brand said that the food at the outlet is still being prepared by human staff and with the machines at work the orders are being delivered more efficiently.

In a blog post Keith Vanecek who operates the test restaurant stated:

“The technology in this restaurant not only allows us to serve our customers in new innovative ways it gives our restaurant team the ability to concentrate more on order speed and accuracy which makes the experience more enjoyable for everyone.”

The aim of the fast-food chain's new test restaurant is to enhance the accuracy and order speed for customers with the brand dubbing the concept “more seamless than ever before.”

However customers have some qualms about the new system especially in light of the fact that the minimum wage in Texas is $7.25 per hour and it has not grown in almost 10 years. It sits just above the $5.15 minimum pay of Georgia and Wyoming which is $2.10 less than the federal minimum wage.

The other five states that have not established a minimum work wage are Louisiana South Carolina Tennessee Alabama and Mississippi.

The majority of the company's employees nationwide make less than $15 per hour which is much below the minimum wage in practically every state.

McDonald's was founded in San Bernardino California in 1940 by Richard and Maurice McDonald. The brand has since become one of the largest fast-food chains in the world."

The COVID-19 pandemic — and its seemingly never-ending aftermath — has been a nightmare for commercial landlords of many different stripes particularly those with significant holdings in retail and traditional office properties.

But in the Boulder Valley and Northern Colorado — especially along the U.S. Highway 36 corridor connecting Denver Broomfield and Boulder — life-sciences and biotechnology companies with a thus-far unquenchable thirst for flex-industrial square footage have kept brokers and builders busy. And with 2023 upon us there’s no sign of a slowdown on the horizon.

While office users who have largely remained in work-from-home or hybrid mode leaving their workplaces underused life-sciences companies are champing at the bit for additional space in the Boulder Valley a market that’s rapidly becoming one of the industry’s leading regions.

SPONSORED CONTENT Commercial Solar is a big investment but not an overwhelming one Solar offers a significant economic benefit for commercial property owners while also positively impacting the environment and offering a path to compliance for new municipal requirements like Energize Denver. A local experienced solar installer will help you navigate the complexities of commercial solar to achieve financial success for your project.

“It’s been a very active second half of 2022” BioMed Realty LLC president of West Coast markets Jon Bergschneider told BizWest in an interview this month.

In the Boulder Valley region “you’ve got a great convergence of public and private industry academic [institutions] like the University [of Colorado] venture capital” that combine to spur the growth of the local life-sciences industry along with the real estate development necessary to support that growth Bergschneider said. “It’s a multi-piston engine.”

All told that biotech-related development accounts for “approximately 2.5 million to 3 million square feet of construction … underway or in the pipeline along the Boulder/Denver corridor” according to a recent report from Boulder-based commercial real estate brokerage Dean Callan & Co. When you add proposed projects that have not been fully permitted that square footage total is much higher.

“While office leasing has slowed dramatically life science development is full steam ahead” the report said. New development activity “will be a big boost to attracting more companies to our market and create even more demand for the [research and development] product Boulder provides.”

The biotech explosion in and around Boulder over the last half-decade or so comes as little surprise to local players who have long understood the region to be a technology powerhouse that punches well above its weight.

Erik Abrahamson a senior vice president with CBRE said during BizWest’s Boulder Valley Real Estate Conference held last month that “life science follows tech. We’ve got the tech.”

He said the University of Colorado is producing the “best in the world” graduates in bioscience. Smaller companies have been swallowed up by larger players spreading the seeds of capital and talent to foster new generations of biotech startups.

Mike Ruhl vice president of leasing for BioMed compared the Boulder area to “to what Seattle was 10-15 years ago.”

BioMed which this year bought a roughly 1 million-square-foot portfolio in Flatirons Park for $625 million — the largest real estate deal in Colorado history “look[s] for highly educated markets an influx of venture capital and places with tech already here” he said.

Despite the excitement the biotech industry is not of course entirely without its recent hiccups.

For example Inscripta Inc. a genomic-editing platform born out of the University of Colorado is shuttering its Boulder research and development hub and headquarters in January resulting in mass layoffs for employees at the site.

Meanwhile Clovis Oncology Inc. (Nasdaq: CLVS) defaulted on a loan agreement this month and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

“At a high level there have certainly been some macro issues that face everybody no matter what geography or industry you’re in” Bergschneider said. Those issues unsurprisingly relate mainly to interest rates volatility in capital markets supply-chain disruptions and a prolonged period of tightness in the labor market.

Macroeconomics haven’t slammed the brakes on local biotech developments but they are likely to make things more expensive both for builders and tenants.

“As [development costs] continue to rise rents need to rise in lockstep in order for developments to pencil and for there to be economically acceptable returns for landlords” Bergschneider said.

Still “life-sciences on the whole and Boulder on the whole has held on really well” he said. “We still see a tremendous amount of demand and great fundamentals.”

Observers across organizations remain quite bullish on the overall outlook for the local sector with access to top talent often cited as a particularly attractive asset.

“For me talent is everything. You grow through talent and creating great technology is really all about talent” Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. president Damaris Mills told BizWest this week. “We see Boulder as being this central U.S. hub for a lot of [biotechnology] talent — and increasingly so.”

Iowa-based IDT entered the local biotechnology sphere this month with the $48 million purchase of technology developed by and facilities formerly occupied by Boulder-born ArcherDX Inc. Archer producer of genetic assays for cancer patients was previously acquired in 2020 for $1.4 by California genetics-testing company Invitae Corp. (NYSE: NVTA) which is now facing significant financial turmoil.

“We’re excited about the site and we’re really excited about the talent that’s here on the team and in the broader community” Mills said.

Here are some highlights of life-sciences real estate projects planned in progress or recently completed in that broader Boulder Valley and Northern Colorado community:

Boulder

BioMed purchased Flatiron Park with the express purpose of improving its status as a regional hub for biotech R&D.

“At acquisition about 25% of the park was life-sciences. Our goal is to convert that up to about 50% life-sciences” Bergschneider said. “We’ve always envisioned a multi-faceted ownership model in which we’re appealing both to life-sciences and technology [tenants].”

The conversion process is underway and is expected to take a handful of years to complete.

Meanwhile on nearby Walnut Street Conscience Bay Co. LLC is developing West Meadows a 112423-square-foot building that the company said represents a “significant opportunity for a cutting edge two-story science and technology development.”

Broomfield

Dallas-based investor and developer Mohr Capital LLC is dipping its first toe in the market with plans to build a four-building speculative campus on a vacant parcel next to the Oracle Corp. operation in Broomfield’s Interlocken business park.

“They’ve been looking to get into the market here for a while” said WK Real Estate (Wright-Kingdom Inc.) broker Andrew Freeman who along with representatives from commercial brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (NYSE:JLL) is marketing the project.

Mohr’s plan Freeman told BizWest last month is to build four basically identical “life-science slash industrial-flex buildings” that will total nearly 400000 square feet.

Nearby another Dallas developer Lincoln Property Co. is developing a large new office research and development and light-manufacturing campus in Interlocken with an eye toward biotech tenants.

The project known as CoRE – Colorado Research Exchange will be built at 235 Interlocken Blvd. and is planned to total about 450000 square feet spread across four buildings that will range from about 16000 square feet for the development’s amenities center to nearly 200000 square feet for the largest office building.

Louisville

Redtail Ridge represents a major question mark for Louisville’s life-sciences future.

The project which for years has proved difficult to push across the regulatory finish line could eventually house a 2.6 million-square-foot commercial-only development with a focus on biotechnology facilities on the roughly 400-acre long-vacant former Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX) site off U.S. 36.

However residents and Louisville officials have been thus far unwilling to grant the approvals necessary for Denver-based developer Brue Baukol Capital Partners LLC and partner Sterling Bay LLC to break ground.

Superior

Another controversial life-sciences proposal in the eastern portion of Boulder County is the Coal Creek Innovation Campus in Superior which could add more than 1200 jobs including many in the biotech sector.

The project planned by Superior master builder RC (Ranch Capital) Superior LLC by San Diego health care real estate developer PMB LLC calls for the construction of four buildings totaling more than 366000 square feet.

Coal Creek was approved in September on a controversial split vote of Superior’s Board of Trustees. Residents cried foul petitioned and sued and last month the board repealed its approval leaving the project in development purgatory.

Lafayette

Construction began in 2021 at the site of the new Medtronic corporate campus just south of the SCL Health Good Samaritan Medical Center in Lafayette. Lucas High/BizWest.



Redtail Ridge partner Sterling Bay is transforming a Lafayette Corporate Campus office building formerly leased to Ball Corp. (NYSE: BLL) into a speculative flex space geared toward biotechnology tenants.

The company which bought the Campus Drive property as part of a $74.5 million portfolio acquisition deal in 2021 with developer Etkin Johnson Real Estate Partners intends a roughly 50-50 split between office and laboratory uses for the roughly 52000-square-foot space.

The lab space will be geared toward research and development uses rather than light manufacturing such as pharmaceutical or medical-device production.

Just next door to the Lafayette Corporate Campus Medtronic Inc. is putting the finishing touches on its medical-device research and development hub.

The company will soon consolidate its local business into 400000 square feet of new office and laboratory space spread across two five-story buildings. Of that 60000 square feet will be dedicated to research and development a 10000-square-foot increase over Medtronic’s current R&D footprint in the region.

Frederick

One of the region’s most significant life-science projects isn’t in the Boulder Valley but just a few miles to the north in Frederick.

It’s there that Agilent Technologies Inc. is planning a major expansion at its manufacturing hub.

The project which state officials estimate could cost upward of $784 million could could nearly double Agilent’s Colorado workforce and nearly quadruple its physical footprint in Frederick.

The Santa Clara California-headquartered Agilent began developing its 130000-square-foot manufacturing facility on 20 acres in the Eagle Business Park adjacent to Interstate 25 in 2016.

The company — which according to its website “provides laboratories worldwide with instruments services consumables applications and expertise enabling customers to gain the insights they seek” — also has existing operations in Boulder. All told Agilent employs about 520 workers in Colorado Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade documents show.

“Agilent is planning to expand its existing facility located at the northwest corner of Tipple Parkway [and] Eagle Boulevard” according to a traffic analysis report provided to Frederick planners. “The expansion project is anticipated to add 310000 square feet of manufacturing building 61000 square feet of associated office uses 42000 square feet of warehouse/central utility plant 2000 square feet of drum storage expansion and 10000 square feet of tank farm.”

The expansion which planning documents show is expected to be complete by the end of 2024 would “accommodate approximately 465 additional employees for the Agilent facility.”

Agilent much like it did when the existing Frederick operation was built has turned to public bodies to help subsidize the project. The company expects to receive more than $10 million in incentives for the Northern Colorado expansion.

Loveland

Last year Beckman Coulter Life Sciences began expanding its presence in Loveland with the construction of a new $9 million office at Etkin Johnson Real Estate Partners’ Axis 25 development.

The 95114-square-foot building expected to allow the company to hire 85 more local workers is scheduled for completion in 2024.

“We have been on a rapid growth journey in Loveland since 2018 when we started with nearly three dozen employees” Beckman Coulter Life Sciences president Greg Milosevich said last year in a prepared statement. “Our strong business needs required us to ramp up quickly last year and we’re proud that despite the economic downturn in 2020 we were able to create more than 60 high-paying jobs in Loveland.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzI2LzMtbWVkaWNhbC1kaXZpZGVuZC1zdG9ja3MtdGhhdC1oaXQtdGhlLXN3ZWV0LXNwb3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Medical Dividend Stocks That Hit the Sweet Spot,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzI2LzMtbWVkaWNhbC1kaXZpZGVuZC1zdG9ja3MtdGhhdC1oaXQtdGhlLXN3ZWV0LXNwb3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000212273072E0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The initiative supports the company’s work in expanding access to health and accelerating progress toward the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goal 3 which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all. More specifically it is focused on creating a world where no woman has to die while giving life by helping to address the first target under SDG 3 reducing the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100000 live births by 2030.

“I am so proud of our company’s longstanding commitment to our Merck for Mothers initiative which is dedicated to improving maternal health outcomes around the world” Allison Goldberg president Merck Foundation said. “Through Merck for Mothers we have now helped more than 30 million women access high-quality life-saving care around pregnancy and childbirth — surpassing our goal of reaching 25 million women by 2025. This milestone serves as a reminder that much work is left to be done and we remain committed to helping create a world where no woman has to die while giving life.”

Through wide-ranging approaches Merck for Mothers harnesses the power of public-private collaboration to strengthen health systems and mobilize solutions to address the diverse and unique needs of moms babies and families worldwide. The initiative’s milestone of 30 million women reached reflects the combined total impact of the programs and partnerships it supports in more than 70 countries including India Brazil Kenya Nigeria and the U.S.

The U.S. is the only high-income country in which maternal mortality is on the rise — where Merck for Mothers supports a variety of programs to address racial inequities in maternal health outcomes.

Just throw money at any old influencer and who cares what sticks. These days media companies need to show they’re effective at showing an ROI on advertising spend especially for social media.

Social media may be a disruptive technology but it has done little to benefit mankind except to create a generation of superficial narcissists with eight-second attention spans. More concerning are marketers in big corporations throwing money at this behavior under the guise of buying “influence.” Consequently social media firms have become fat and lax Twitter being a great example of what easy money does to large companies.

Mr. Musk’s takeover of Twitter provided the perfect catalyst for advertisers to start questioning what ROI their ad spend has been getting. Outrage aside the corresponding revenue decline is part of a much bigger picture – the global slowing of advertising spend.

Advertising Spend Slows

Ad market growth is expected to slow down significantly in 2023. That’s according to marketing analytics firm WARC which expects global ad spend to grow by 8.3% this year to a total of $881 billion but fall to 2.3% growth in the coming year. There’s every reason to believe growth will stall because of the delayed reactions we’re seeing. It takes time to craft messaging around layoffs and budget cuts.

Despite the latest surge of negative momentum Roblox remains one of the most enticing long-term metaverse plays.

Indeed the metaverse hype has faded in a major way over the past year. Firms like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) committed to investing large sums in building digital worlds have been met with relentless selling. There’s not much visibility as to what the “metaverse” will look like once it’s ready for the average consumer.

In any case the metaverse remains a technological trend to keep tabs on even as investors dismiss it because of the massive investment it entails. With little to no clarity on the type of reward to be expected from hefty capital expenditures it’s unsurprising that investors would rather firms cut their forward-thinking investments.

Undoubtedly the metaverse seems like an abstract moonshot of sorts. In a higher-interest-rate environment the risks of such a project not taking off are much higher than if rates were hovering near zero. In such a high-rate world expect less risk-taking on the part of tech companies especially the smaller ones with smaller cash flows and suspect balance sheets. Such risk-taking could curb innovation and delay many technological trends investors grew excited about in 2021.

Despite the added stress on small- and mid-cap innovators big tech remains financially healthy and more than willing to keep moving the puck forward even as the masses call for cuts. Meta Platforms is still pushing ahead with its metaverse ambitions. If anything higher rates seem to be a higher hurdle for unicorns and startups with sights set on the metaverse.

Roblox is a company that I view as a better metaverse play than Meta Platforms. Its platform is already quite mature and has stuck with younger audiences. Though the recent quarter and November 2022 metric release raised some red flags about the medium-term growth story I remain bullish on the stock.

Roblox Stock Hit with Downgrades after Poor ABPDAU Figure

High-multiple growth stocks have once again felt the full force of the Fed’s interest rate hikes. With a third-quarter miss ($0.50 EPS loss vs. $0.32 loss estimate) recession jitters and investor unwillingness to look too far into the future for profits it’s not a mystery why Roblox stock finds itself in the gutter again at around $26 and change per share. The latest average bookings per daily active user (ABPDAU) report for November added more salt into the stock’s wound. Non-adjusted ABPDAU fell 7% to 9% Roblox estimates catching Wall Street off guard and helping induce a brutal plunge in the stock.

Following the underwhelming ABPDAU number analysts quickly downgraded their RBLX stock price targets. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) recently noted that the weak booking growth broke the reacceleration trend.

Indeed Roblox’s booking numbers could remain under considerable pressure as we approach a recession. Consumer budgets are feeling the pinch right now and things could get worse before they get any better as high inflation meets a global economic downturn. Beyond the recession Roblox could be poised for a swift reacceleration as the firm looks to continue innovating with its platform.

Roblox is continuing to invest in its developers. Recession or not its platform is becoming richer with experiences. As long as Roblox can keep engaging its users the long-term growth profile still seems intact. In my mind a recession is unlikely to mark the beginning of the end for the impressive video game platform.

Is Roblox Stock a Buy According to Analysts?

Turning to Wall Street RBLX stock comes in as a Hold. Out of 17 analyst ratings there are seven Buys six Holds and four Sell recommendations.

The average Roblox price target is $36.56 implying upside potential of 36.7%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $19.00 per share to a high of $51.00 per share.

The Bottom Line on RBLX Stock

Roblox is one of the firms with a metaverse-like economy that’s been alive and well for many years. In that regard I still view Roblox as a metaverse frontrunner and a candidate that could be quick to turn once we start talking about the metaverse again.

Indeed investing in extremely forward-looking trends with rates on the rise is hard. As winds of recession eat into growth many secular growers will be mistaken for firms on their way out. I’d group RBLX stock in the former camp. In the meantime the stock will continue to feel the pressure of the harsh macro environment.

Emma Staffler |

$90M is the price Meta Platforms Inc. (formerly Facebook Inc.) will pay to settle a class action lawsuit for unlawfully tracking user information when users were logged out of the site.

The settlement ruling was issued on November 14 2022 by Judge Edward J. Davila of the Northern District of California. The order which granted plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class action settlement and attorney fees notes of the $90 million dollars in settlement dollars $26.1 million will be for attorney fees. The platform giant was also ordered to delete certain “wrongfully collected” data.

The settlement specifies that $26.1 million of the $90 million settlement dollars will be for attorney fees vs $39.21 per class member. The platform giant was also ordered to delete certain “wrongfully collected” data. (source: govinfo.gov).

Over objections that the settlement amount was insufficient the judge found it to be “fair reasonable and adequate.” (Follow this link to review the entire settlement agreement).

Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement Meta Platforms Inc.will pay the $90000000 into a common settlement fund and sequester and expunge all improperly collected data without admitting liability. This amount also includes attorneys’ fees and costs the cost of class notice and settlement administration and the class representatives’ service awards.

After deductions from the common fund for fees costs and service awards approximately $61124415.87 will remain to be distributed among the participating Class Members. Class members who submitted a total of 1558805 valid claims get approximately $39.21 per class member. This settlement brings an end to litigation going back to 2011."

The Giants can clinch their first playoff berth in six years with a victory in either of their final two regular-season games — beginning Sunday against the Colts — but their first-year head coach was an impenetrable wall of consistent messaging Monday when asked about handling elevated stakes. No need to address the topic that is on everyone’s mind but no one wants to prematurely discuss.

“We just try to control our own destiny each week by trying to win a game” Daboll said. “The goal is always to try to go 1-0 and that’ll be no different this week.”

The only indication of anything out of the routine was a tweet from Barkley urging fans to create a home-field advantage. He deftly avoided mention of the playoffs.

“Home Finale at MetLife [Stadium] this Sunday Giants fans NEED YOU THERE!!! NEED YOU LOUD!! Merry Christmas” Barkley wrote late Sunday night.

Daboll granted one minor concession while absorbing what he called repeat “body blows” — the same question posed in various forms by different reporters — when asked about fan support. The Giants last played a win-and-in game at home in the finale of the 2011 season clinching the NFC East on the way to a Super Bowl XLVI title.

“We work extremely hard each week to put a good product on the field and one of the reasons is for our fan base” Daboll said. “So to play at home in late December [actually Jan. 1] in an important game it’s important to us. I know it’s important to them. And we’ll do everything we can do to be ready to go.”

Oh so it is an important game? Judging by the stoicism on Daboll’s face and in his voice even the most skilled playoff-scenario mathematicians couldn’t be certain.

“Thinking about what’s going to go on a week from now or [in] two weeks or what happened five weeks ago you learn lessons from those things that happened in the past” Daboll said. “And I certainly have in my years watching how different coaches do it and watching how different teams react. But every team is different. Every season is different. Heck every week is different. So what I’ve learned — not just in this business but each day — is to just try to win the day.”

The Giants refused to treat a Dec. 18 game against Washington as a playoff game — even though the outcome offered an approximate 50 percent swing in playoff probability according to fivethirtyeight.com — because there still were paths into the postseason after a loss. And they weren’t focused on clinching Saturday in a loss to the Vikings because other results around the NFL needed to happen too. But this game has to be treated with playoff-like intensity because it is win-and-in right?

“No it’s our next game” Daboll said. “I think everybody knows what you just said. But what we can control is the same stuff we try to control each week — making sure we’re prepared ready to go and put our best foot forward.”

Barkley’s feet are saying what his mouth won’t. He is averaging 8.6 yards per carry with a touchdown and four first downs gained on 10 fourth-quarter carries over the last two games setting a tone for how to handle pressure.

NY Post illustration

“He runs hard” Daboll said. “He makes good decisions with the ball and where to run it and he’s a talented player. Good players have to play well particularly in the fourth quarter of close games.”

The Giants have a 91 percent chance to make the playoffs and actually could clinch Sunday even with a loss to the Colts if one of these three scenarios happens: The Commanders and Seahawks lose; the Commanders Lions and Packers lose; the Lions Seahawks and Packers lose. If the Giants lose and none of those three happen then it’s just about do-or-die in Week 18 at the Eagles.

“I’m thankful for the position that we’re in but there’s a lot of work that needs to be done” Daboll said. “It starts this week just like every other week we’ve had.”

I had come for a few days this past fall dutifully overloading my senses and depleting my wallet every time I left my hotel room. But at a dinner one night with a large group of colleagues I heard the first rumblings of discontent and unfulfilled wishes. ""You wouldn't"" the woman next to me at our table asked the waiter gently ""just happen by any chance to have Coke?"" He shook his head. She'd already guessed as much.

""Am I tripping or is everything here Pepsi products?""

Vegas is a Pepsi town — so much a Pepsi town that it's one of the few places in the world that's ever served Pepsi in some of its McDonald's locations. If you go on travel forums you will discover spirited discussions about how tricky it can be to find a Coke or as one Redditor put is earlier this year ""Am I tripping or is everything here Pepsi products?"" And if you Google ""Las Vegas Pepsi"" your results will produce the plaintive ""Why is there no Coke in Las Vegas?"" Naturally once I realized this I wanted nothing else from Sin City but an icy bottle of the Real Thing.

There is in fact Coke to be found in Vegas most notably in some higher-end properties like the Bellagio. There is even a Coca-Cola store on the Strip so you won't be deprived if that's your preference. But as the Vital Vegas guide noted back in 2019 ""The Strip is Pepsi dominated as the big casino companies have deals with Pepsi."" Caesars properties for instance are Pepsi zones. And with Pepsi comes its suite of other beverages — handy to know if you're a fan of Mountain Dew. But considering the deluge of advertising for Bacardi I encountered in my hotel I did find myself wondering if my cocktail hour plans might have to include a rum and…. Pepsi.

Pepsi's relationship with the town shows up in other ways. In 2020 PepsiCo launched its Dig In initiative to support Black owned restaurants across the country which just this fall featured a Restaurant Royalty Residency program to ""bring signature dishes from Black-owned restaurants"" to MGM properties in Las Vegas.

In hindsight I can see how Pepsi with its somewhat edgier brand identity is a natural fit for Vegas. It likewise checks out that wholesome all-American Coke in contrast dominates the happiest place on earth.

The Disney relationship goes back to before there were even Disney theme parks. As Chelsea Burnett Alliance Manager of Disney Corporate Alliances wrote on the Disney Parks blog last year ""Our relationship with Coca-Cola started in 1942 when Walt Disney first appeared on the Coca-Cola radio program 'The Pause That Refreshes on the Air.'"" Coke was on the menu when Disneyland opened back in 1955 but it's been the parks' exclusive beverage provider since the 1980's. Today the company's products are ubiquitous in Disney parks all around the world.

Theme parks and casinos are of course just a larger manifestation of the kind of corporate contracts that not so subtly guide our recreational consumption choices. Julian Goldie CEO of the SEO link-building Goldie Agency notes ""A movie theater may enter into a partnership with a particular soda brand and exclusively serve that brand in their concessions or an amusement park may be sponsored by a particular snack food company and feature their products throughout the park. Brands can often guide our choices through strategic product placement and promotional efforts. For example a casino may prominently display certain brands of beverages near popular gaming areas or a music venue may offer discounts on certain brands of drinks as part of a special promotion."" Or Caesars may choose like it did this spring the High Roller wheel as the perfect place to launch a Pepsi Nitro pop-up experience. The result as Steven Zhang founder of the tea culture blog TeaJust notes is that ""these tactics create an association between the brand and the experience of enjoying a night out.""

If you're very a brand-loyal traveler you might want to do some advance work before you take off so you're not already ordering room service before you learn that Pepsi is the drink of choice in Marriott's over 6300 properties. And if you're thirsty for the thing that refreshes you most you might have to get out and stock up. Matt James of the travel blog Visitingly suggests ""If you are in a 'Coke town' and want a Pepsi you can usually find one at a convenience store or grocery store. You may also be able to request a different brand of soda at restaurants or bars although they may not always have it available."" When all else fails you can always just order something else — but it wouldn't be quite the same right?

I am not enough of a soda consumer to usually care — or notice — the soft drink culture of a particular town or resort. (I have however been known to get feisty about the beer offerings at certain stadiums.) But the elusiveness of Coke in Vegas made it absolutely tantalizing to me. There Coca-Cola glittered like an effervescent dream in my imagination as out of reach as a row of cherries on a slot machine. I bought a bottle at my bodega when I got home. It was okay. But like so many things about Las Vegas getting it wasn't as good as wanting it had been.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8xMi1iZXN0LXNlYXNvbmFsLXN0b2Nrcy1idXktMTUxODUwNDUxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,12 Best Seasonal Stocks To Buy Now,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8xMi1iZXN0LXNlYXNvbmFsLXN0b2Nrcy1idXktMTUxODUwNDUxLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021225EA48B0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

It’s not the most wonderful time of the year for the Circa Survivor contestant who was eliminated Sunday.

After surviving their 17th straight winning pick on the Vikings — who beat the Giants on a 61-yard field goal as time expired — Maddog was one of only four entrants left entering Saturday night’s Raiders-Steelers game.

Three other entrants needed Pittsburgh to win to advance to “Christmas Week” which was comprised of the four NFL games on Sunday and Monday.

If the Raiders had defeated the Steelers Maddog would’ve won the $1000-entry contest which started with a field of 6133. The Silver and Black led 10-3 at halftime and were still ahead 10-6 in the final minute as Pittsburgh drove deep into Raiders territory.

Facing fourth-and-1 at the Raiders’ 15 with 55 seconds left Kenny Pickett picked up the first down on a quarterback sneak. On the next play the rookie fired a 14-yard touchdown strike to George Pickens to put the Steelers up 13-10 with 46 seconds to go.

Derek Carr then threw his third interception of the second half to seal Maddog’s fate and that of bettors who took the Raiders +2½.

Still alive in the final four Maddog needed the Dolphins to beat the Packers on Sunday to advance. Miami went ahead 20-10 late in the first half before unraveling as Tua Tagovailoa threw three fourth-quarter interceptions in a 26-20 loss.

Contestants “Browna” and “Jed” had better luck with the Buccaneers who erased a 16-6 fourth-quarter deficit en route to a 19-16 OT win over the Cardinals. The last remaining entrant “The Enemy Within” had the Chargers over the Colts on “Monday Night Football.”

Bettor wins $500K on Steelers

The Raiders’ loss resulted in a mixed bag at the books as Station Casinos won big on the game and BetMGM lost big largely because of one bettor who won $500000 on a $550000 straight bet on Pittsburgh -2½.

“We got beat up a little on Saturday” MGM Resorts director of trading Lamarr Mitchell said. “The Raiders was our biggest loser.”

On the flip side bettors overwhelmingly backed the Silver and Black at Station.

“We clearly were Steelers fans” Red Rock Resort sportsbook director Chuck Esposito said. “Having the Steelers win that game late saved the day. The Raiders seem to find more ways to lose late in games.”

Dogs deal loss to bettors

Bettors who lost on the NFL overall as underdogs went 8-7 ATS with six outright wins by the Rams (+3 beat Broncos 51-14) Packers (+3½ beat Dolphins 26-20) Texans (+3½ beat Titans 19-14) Saints (+3½ beat Browns 17-10) Panthers (+2½ beat Lions 37-23) and Jaguars (+2½ beat Jets 19-3).

The same BetMGM bettor who won $500000 on the Raiders also won $500000 on the Chiefs (-10 beat Seahawks 24-10) but lost $550000 on Denver.

The biggest losers for bettors were the Lions Browns and Titans.

Bettors win big on Bengals

The biggest winners for bettors were the Bengals (-3 beat Patriots 22-18) and Cowboys (-3½ beat Eagles 40-34).

Cincinnati squandered most of a 22-0 halftime lead and Bengals backers were ready for New England to deliver the final dagger when it had a first-and-goal at the 5 with 55 seconds left. But Rhamondre Stevenson lost a fumble and the Bengals escaped with the win and cover.

“The Patriots were our biggest loser on Saturday” Westgate SuperBook vice president Jay Kornegay said. “I thought we had a chance there. It would’ve been a nice backdoor (cover) for us. But we ended up coming up short.”

Dallas didn’t lead in the second half until it went ahead 37-34 on a 48-yard field goal with 2:19 left. Philadelphia which had four turnovers without Jalen Hurts fumbled on the next play. The Cowboys added another field goal and held on for the cover when the Eagles turned it over on downs at the Dallas 19 in the final seconds.

“The Cowboys were a loser plus a big loss on in-play that hurt with the Cowboys coming back” Caesars assistant director of trading Adam Pullen said. “Turnovers killed the Eagles. But they showed why they’re one of the best teams in the league. Even without Hurts they could’ve won that game.”

Being a proprietary interface means that even entry-level programmers like the Atmel-ICE are rather expensive at over $100. That’s when for [Scott W Harden] the question arose of whether the much cheaper MPLAB Snap board (~$34) could be used as well for AVR UDPI purposes.

The stages of grief that [Scott] went through before he had it working involved among others the updating of the MPLAB Snap board firmware getting yelled at by the Microchip Studio IDE when attempting to use the Snap for AVR MCU programming and ultimately fixing the board following the relevant Microchip Engineering Technical Note (ETN #36) that specifies the removal of a 4.7 kΩ pull-down resistor (R48) on the Snap board. This allows the UDPI line to be pulled high by the MCU.

As the ETN notes an external pull-up may also be used to override the pull-down which would leave the ICSP functionality of of the Snap intact. As [Scott] mentions in his conclusion it feels as if UDPI AVR support with the Snap is really an afterthought for Microchip. Meanwhile there are also more DIY solutions as [Scott] adds which are useful for just flashing the MCU. An example is with a USB-TTL serial adapter and pymcuprog.

The problem with DIY solutions like jtag2updi ftdi2updi and their kin is the effort required to assemble them and the uncertainty of long-term support as the UPDI ecosystem keeps evolving with new devices and new features. The MPLAB Snap with resistor mod may be just that middle ground between an Atmel-ICE and reverse-engineered OSS projects.

Elon Musk's ambitions for Neuralink raise 'deep serious' questions (part 1),"Home News Healing the lame bringing sight to the blind? Elon Musk's ambitions for Neuralink raise 'deep serious' questions (part 1)

Did we think about Elon Musk more in 2022 than we did a year ago?

That thought might seem inconceivable considering that just 12 months after he was named Time magazine’s Person of the Year for 2021 Musk has become even more of a global presence.

Now that doesn’t mean life has been perfect for the world’s richest man: while he’s recently dominated headlines for his turbulent Twitter takeover his other ventures have not gone unscathed.

While still the darling of the EV industry Tesla has lost nearly half its market value since Musk first made his bid for Twitter potentially threatening his status as the wealthiest man on Earth; SpaceX remains on course to shatter Musk’s goal of 60 launches in 2022 even as some SpaceX employees accuse Musk of violating labor laws; Starlink is well on its way to becoming the world's largest satellite-based consumer internet provider amid mounting frustration from customers; and Musk’s tunneling venture The Boring Company is reportedly losing engineers and staff despite making progress toward building underground transport systems in several U.S. cities.

But despite that resume it’s Neuralink Musk’s medical device company that has perhaps aroused the greatest interest — and suspicion — from both Christian and secular ethicists alike.

In 2019 Neuralink used ""sewing machine-like technology ... to drill small holes into brains and insert super-slender electrodes called threads steering clear of blood vessels as they go.""

Neuralink was reportedly designing its electrodes to not only ""read"" from neural activity but ""write"" signals into the brain amid scientists stating goals of restoring senses like touch or vision.

At that time Musk said that the technology was placed inside a monkey's brain and that the animal was able to control a computer through its thoughts. He aspired to have it implanted in a human being by the end of 2019.

That goal was ultimately revised earlier this month when Musk announced he expects Neuralink to successfully develop a wireless brain chip and begin human clinical trials on such a device by mid-2023.

It marked the latest timeline revision for Musk who has said the brain interfaces could enable disabled users to move and communicate while also restoring vision — evoking almost biblical imagery of Jesus healing the lame and bringing sight to the blind.

While some Christian neurologists have spoken out on ethical questions raised by implanting devices into the human brain Musk has said the reason he created the company in the first place was as a “risk mitigation for digital super-intelligence.”

“The reason I created Neuralink long-term as a risk mitigation for digital super-intelligence in that if we are able to effectively achieve symbiosis with digital intelligence then…the collective human will is better able to steer things in the direction that we’d like or even with benign AI at least go along for the ride” he told The Babylon Bee in an interview last year.

“We’re already at this point partially a cyborg … in that our phones and computers and applications are a digital extension of ourselves at this point.”

Among other goals Musk said he’s confident Neuralink will ultimately allow paraplegic or even tetraplegic to operate a phone “faster than someone who has … working hands.”

While undeniable lofty goals can hardly be described as nefarious some have speculated about whether Musk has an ultimate agenda one that perhaps stems from what at least one Christian thinker has described as a worldview that veers toward “atheistic transhumanism.”

But what exactly does that mean?

The Rev. Christopher Benek a Presbyterian pastor in South Florida and the founding chair of the Christian Transhumanist Association believes the transhumanism movement — which he describes as a “complex web of philosophies theologies and practical technological developments” — will ultimately become an “inevitable part of human reality.”

Benek’s personal aspiration for humanity is to “enact a Christian transhumanism that merges technological development with the teachings of Christ.

“The question is: to which transhumanist worldview will the bulk of humanity adhere?” Benek told The Christian Post.

For Benek the transhumanism movement based on biblical theology shouldn’t pose any conflict.

“Most Christians should be fine with the proposed Neuralink developments as healing is at the core of the Christian tradition” he said.

That sentiment was echoed by Seth Dillon CEO of satire news site The Babylon Bee who told CP he sees great promise in Neuralink’s potential commercial applications.

""The prospect of being able to restore the ability to walk and move to someone who's dealing with paralysis is unbelievably amazing” said Dillon. “That would be a huge huge achievement and it would change a lot of people's lives.""

And as for the whole “microchip in the brain” thing?

""We've already let technology dominate our lives so much I think a lot of people are rightfully very wary of having it be integrated with our bodies” Dillon said.

As Neuralink has conducted animal testing and seeks approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to begin clinical trials in humans Musk has said he wants to be “extremely careful and certain that it will work well before putting a device into a human.

But assuming that development is a foregone conclusion does that mean alarm bells should be going off in the Church when it comes to Neuralink and other similar technology?

Todd Hampson co-host of the ""Prophecy Pros Podcast"" doesn’t think so.

“Guys like Musk are visionaries and often make grand claims. From a leadership perspective a grand vision can push people to aim higher than they would have otherwise” Hampson told CP.

“Thinking big is not wrong. Thinking big apart from the recognition of God is” he added pointing to Nimrod and the Tower of Babel in Genesis 11 as an example of going beyond the bounds that God has established.

“That never ends well” said Hampson.

Even if Neuralink and other technology can cure blindness and other previously incurable conditions Hampson said the greater danger is abusing the technology for political or economic gain which potentially opens the door to digital totalitarianism.

“The more dangerous applications of something like a brain chip is the possibility of using it to control the way people think” he said.

Hampson said intellectual leaders like Yuval Harari and Klaus Schwab founder of the World Economic Forum are on the record stating they want to control minds with brain chips and other implantable applications.

“Harari has even stated that they want to correct how people think and that the resurrection of Christ is ‘fake news’” he said referring to a 2018 interview at Google in which the author and futurist tried to explain how a Jewish rabbi might dismiss Christian beliefs when promoting their own faith.

“Those are the applications I'm more concerned about” said Hampson. “Technology is neutral for the most part ... but if it is in the wrong hands that's when things get scary.”

Musk did not respond to a request for comment from CP for this piece.

And while he didn’t go into the deeper ethical issues raised by Neuralink in his interview with the Bee Dillon said such considerations are “really deep and serious questions.”

""Can things be imposed on you? Can restrictions be applied to you?” he said. ""I don't know where [Musk is] coming from on that or what his end goals are.

""But to the extent that it's used for things like restoring the ability to walk or to see or reconnecting broken nervous systems that's pretty awesome stuff.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3NhbXN1bmctZWxlY3Ryb25pY3MtYWltcy10by1leHBhbmQtc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3Rvci1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLWF0LXAzLWZhY3RvcnktMTIyMTIyNjAwNDc1XzEuaHRtbNIBlgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9zYW1zdW5nLWVsZWN0cm9uaWNzLWFpbXMtdG8tZXhwYW5kLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1hdC1wMy1mYWN0b3J5LTEyMjEyMjYwMDQ3NV8xLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Samsung Electronics aims to expand semiconductor production at P3 factory,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3NhbXN1bmctZWxlY3Ryb25pY3MtYWltcy10by1leHBhbmQtc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3Rvci1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLWF0LXAzLWZhY3RvcnktMTIyMTIyNjAwNDc1XzEuaHRtbNIBlgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9zYW1zdW5nLWVsZWN0cm9uaWNzLWFpbXMtdG8tZXhwYW5kLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1hdC1wMy1mYWN0b3J5LTEyMjEyMjYwMDQ3NV8xLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021226904820>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The memory chip industry has been booming for the past few years and Micron (MU 2.91%) has taken advantage. The company has built up a large pile of cash on its balance sheet partly the result of record profits and cash flow. That will come in handy now that demand and prices for memory chips are falling off a cliff.

Micron had about $12 billion of cash and investments on its balance sheet on Dec. 1 along with roughly $10.3 billion of debt. The company added $3.4 billion of that debt during the fiscal first quarter a move meant to strengthen its cash position amid deteriorating industry conditions. Micron would have even more cash if it hadn't been buying back its own stock over the past couple of years. From fiscal 2020 through the first quarter of fiscal 2023 Micron dumped $4.2 billion into share buybacks.

When you operate in a commodity industry that's going through the worst downturn in over a decade no amount of cash is too much. Micron's free cash flow was a loss of $1.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter alone. The company is slashing capital spending and costs but further free cash flow losses are likely as the situation deteriorates. Micron's balance sheet is strong but it's going to weaken considerably as this cycle plays out.

An inventory problem

One thing that will make this downturn so much worse than recent downturns is the amount of excess inventory floating around. Three things have to happen before memory chip prices stabilize:

Bloated inventory levels at customers like PC OEMs and cloud computing providers need to be worked down. During this process Micron and fellow memory chip manufacturers will see demand far below end-market demand. Once customer inventory levels are back to healthy levels inventory levels at the manufacturers themselves must be brought down to healthy levels. Once excess inventories across the industry are removed either end-market demand must catch up with production levels or production levels must decline to meet demand.

All of this is going to take a while to play out. Micron expects industry profitability to be ""challenged"" through calendar 2023 although it does see things starting to improve in the second half. Demand for PCs has plunged unexpectedly this year with unit shipments dropping nearly 20% in the third quarter. Micron also expects sluggish demand for smartphones and weakening demand from cloud computing customers as those customers work through existing stocks of memory chips.

While it's hard to know exactly how much inventory is bogging down Micron's customers the company's own inventory situation is quite severe. Micron had $8.36 billion worth of inventory on Dec. 1 up from $6.66 billion three months prior and $4.83 billion one year ago. And since per-bit prices are dropping so quickly the number of bits of inventory is likely rising much faster than the value of that inventory.

We can look at days inventory outstanding (DIO) to better understand the hole Micron is working its way out of. This metric measures the average number of days that a company holds inventory before that inventory is sold and converted into revenue. Micron's DIO is currently 214 far above historical levels. It might be the worst ever.

Micron's inventory situation suggests that this downturn is going to be extremely severe and that it's going to last longer than any downturn in recent memory.

Weathering the storm

Thankfully Micron's balance sheet has enough cash to weather just about any storm. The company could burn cash for the next year which it may very well do and still have plenty of liquidity remaining. Micron will make it through this cycle although the balance sheet will certainly be weakened in the process.

Whether Micron is a good investment right now is hard to say. The company trades at a price-to-book value of about 1.1 close to where that metric bottomed out in recent cycles but this cycle is likely to be so much worse than those. As the company burns through cash and potentially writes down inventory its book value will deflate.

It may be best to wait to buy Micron stock until any remaining optimism has been snuffed out. It's going to get worse for the company before it gets better and I suspect the stock could hit much lower levels in the coming months.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc2VyZXQuY29tL3V0YWgvMjAyMi8xMi8yNi8yMzUwNjM4Ny90ZXhhcy1pbnN0cnVtZW50cy1taWNyb2NoaXAtcGxhbnQtb3BlbnMtaW4tdXRhaC1jaGlwcy1hY3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas Instruments micropchip plant now open in Utah – Deseret News,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc2VyZXQuY29tL3V0YWgvMjAyMi8xMi8yNi8yMzUwNjM4Ny90ZXhhcy1pbnN0cnVtZW50cy1taWNyb2NoaXAtcGxhbnQtb3BlbnMtaW4tdXRhaC1jaGlwcy1hY3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021224ED0CD0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

While we have grown accustomed to seeing large heatsinks on accelerators this was the heatsink on the new AMD EPYC 9004 “Genoa” processors in the server powering the Azure HBv4 line. We now have one of them for the STH YouTube set.

Massive Microsoft Azure HBv4 AMD EPYC Genoa Heatsink

As a quick backstory Microsoft reached out after we posted Microsoft Azure at SC22 and The Enormous AMD EPYC Genoa Heatsink on HBv4 and our Best of SC22 video(see starting at 09:48 below):

Through that exchange we were not allowed to purchase the heatsink (because then we would know the cost but as one can imagine it is likely far less than a Genoa CPU.) The folks at Microsoft hunted down the approvals needed to send STH one for the STH YouTube set. At that point it seemed like folks may be interested in a closer look so that is what we have today.

Here is the heatsink:

A few stats:

The heatsink covers both AMD socket SP5 CPUs

There are a total of 16 heat pipes

The heatsink itself weighs 5.7lbs

Here is a top-down view of the heatsink:

Here is a view of the bottom side of the heatsink:

Here is a view of the bottom side of the heatsink on the CPU side.

Here is a look at the massive array of fins compared to the QCT QuantaGrid single Genoa heatsink:

Here is another view of that comparison for scale.

This is enormous.

Final Words

The STH team just wants to say thank you to the folks at Microsoft Azure for getting this. It is awesome to get to see some of the cloud hardware. If you want to learn more about the Azure HBv4 instance you can take a look here. The HBv4 is the company’s high-performance computing offering that today uses the AMD EPYC 9004 “Genoa” processor. Microsoft has already said that these instances will be upgraded to “Genoa-X” with 3D V-Cache like Milan-X when the instances hit general availability. Microsoft has been working hard to make cloud supercomputing a reality with technologies like high-end processors accelerators and even Infiniband. As this heatsink shows the company is not just buying off-the-shelf servers it is investing in hardware innovations to make compute more efficient and sustainable.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHRvcG1hZy5jb20vaG93LXRvL2Rpc2FibGUtbWljcm9zb2Z0LWVkZ2VzLXNpZGViYXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to disable Microsoft Edge's sidebar,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.laptopmag.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /how-to/disable-microsoft-edges-sidebar (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021226CFA950>, 'Connection to www.laptopmag.com timed out.

The former site of a Philip Morris tobacco plant now hosts the rusting infrastructure of a project once promised to strengthen west Louisville which has historically suffered through disinvestment driven by racist policies.

Benea Durrett has run Essentially Unique Salon across the street for two years. She said the abandoned site is a problem for the community.

“It’s definitely an eyesore. It doesn’t look appealing. It doesn’t state that we can take pride in west Louisville as far as development” she said

Now the long-vacant West End property has a new owner years after the latest project fell apart.

Molina Healthcare finalized its purchase of the 20 acres of vacant property on Broadway between Dixie Highway and Dr W. J. Hodge Street in November. The for-profit company is based in Long Beach California and operates the Kentucky Medicare and Medicaid provider Passport Health Plan by Molina so named after taking over the brand in 2020.

Passport was previously a nonprofit organization. In 2019 it was bought by the consulting firm Evolent Health. The next year Molina spent $20 million to purchase some of Passport’s property and assets including its brand and operations after Passport failed to get a contract with the state.

That July a representative for Molina said the company would separately buy the west Louisville property at 18th and Broadway. It finally completed the deal last month by purchasing the land from a subsidiary of Evolent for $8 million according to deed records.

Passport is one of Kentucky’s managed care organizations which provide Medicaid services to residents. States can use them to lower operating costs and strengthen management of the federal health insurance program.

In September the state’s Court of Appeals upheld Molina’s contract with the Commonwealth as well as a lower court’s ruling that its takeover of Passport’s clients was lawful.

Executive Ryan Sadler said in a November press release the company would collect feedback from city and community leaders for the site.

“Our state and local partners have challenged us to think beyond the needs of our own company to help make this property a vibrant place” Sadler said.

A Molina representative declined to provide further comment on the acquisition and specific plans for the site.

Democratic Metro Council member Jecorey Arthur of District 4 which includes 18th and Broadway said he was part of a December community meeting held by Molina to discuss the site’s future.

As a lifelong West End resident he said he’s excited by the purchase.

“Even though it historically for me in the past several years has been a sign of broken promises I think now it's really more of a sign of hope” Arthur said.



A lack of progress

The west Louisville site has not been actively used since Philip Morris moved out in 2000. A mixed-use development called NewBridge Crossing was planned years later though nothing came of it.

Walmart announced in 2014 it was interested in using the land for a store and received nearly $2 million in financial support from the city. But that plan was abandoned after two years after pressure from local preservationists who opposed the “suburban-style” design that included a large parking lot.

In 2017 Passport said it was planning to use the site to create a campus including the company’s headquarters. At the time officials and community leaders praised the $130 million development as a way to bring jobs and spur investment in the area.

Jacob Munoz / LPM Passport Health Plan abandoned a construction project on 18th and Broadway after changes to Kentucky's Medicaid reimbursements.

But the group stalled construction efforts in early 2019 as it challenged changes to Kentucky’s Medicaid reimbursement formula which heavily decreased rates in Louisville. A large portion of Passport’s clients lived in the city leading to concerns about Passport’s financial viability.

Passport was then dropped twice as a state Medicaid provider: once as Republican Gov. Matt Bevin prepared to leave office and again soon after when his successor Democrat Andy Beshear restarted the state’s MCO bid process. Meanwhile Molina Healthcare did receive a contract which paved the way for them to eventually take over the Passport brand.

Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer acknowledged the site’s troubled history but expressed support for the new ownership.

“We are enthusiastic about Molina Healthcare’s next steps in the long-awaited effort to bring this vacant site back into productive use with the input and needs of the community top of mind” Fischer said according to the November press release.



Visions for success

Jeff O’Brien who heads the city’s economic development agency said in an emailed statement earlier this month that further city involvement would depend on a proposal from Molina. The city previously spent nearly $2 million to help Walmart acquire the site for its unsuccessful store.

“Without seeing a specific plan we cannot yet say what role Louisville Metro Government may [play] in these new efforts to revitalize this vacant site” O’Brien said.

Arthur said he’s heard a variety of ideas for the site including using it for health care affordable and sustainable housing and recreation needs and incorporating small businesses and nonprofits.

But he added people have mainly said they want local residents to have their voices heard and utilized which he hopes they will do by sharing their thoughts with Molina.

Jacob Munoz / LPM A group of local and chain businesses line the Broadway corridor across the street from the unused Passport Health Plan site.

“More than anything the theme that I've heard from everyone no matter what their interests are is that this is a community space. It’s not just a space for a private health care company but it's something that community members can walk into and have access to and feel like they have some ownership in” Arthur said.

Jefferson County Public Schools Superintendent Marty Pollio said at a July school board meeting his district was interested in using the land to create a middle school and was talking with Molina about it. In 2021 workers broke ground on a new JCPS elementary school close by.

A JCPS spokesperson declined to comment on potential plans for the 18th and Broadway site.

Durrett said her business and others near the site could benefit from the exposure of another school even though it could lead to traffic and safety concerns.

She said she hopes whatever happens to the unutilized space includes opportunities for small business owners like herself.

“Broadway in west Louisville is supposed to be a staple part of the community” Durrett said.

While some projects on 18th and Broadway have struggled one development at that intersection has delivered success: The Republic Bank Foundation YMCA which is planned to connect to JCPS’s new elementary school opened in late 2019 as part of a push for west Louisville development projects.

Five Trail Blended American Whiskey 2022,"Editor’s Note: This whiskey was provided to us as a review sample by Coors Whiskey Co. This in no way per our editorial policies influenced the final outcome of this review. It should also be noted that by clicking the buy link towards the bottom of this review our site receives a small referral payment which helps to support but not influence our editorial and other costs.

With persistence planning and an expanded company mindset towards alcoholic beverages fifth generation David Coors expanded the family business into whiskey. The first outward hint of a change occurred in 2020 when the company swapped “Brewing” for “Beverage” to become the Molson Coors Beverage Company. The company released its first whiskey in 2021. 2022 marks their second release from batch number 002CWC22-A which was launched in October.

The whiskey is a blend of three bourbons sourced from Kentucky and Indiana and a single malt whiskey. It is a blend of 51% four-year-old wheat-heavy bourbon from Indiana 36% four-year-old four-grain bourbon from Kentucky 8% six-year-old Colorado single malt and 5% 12-year-old corn-heavy bourbon from Kentucky. The single malt is made from High Country Barley from Coors’ malthouse in Golden Colorado.

Not having spent much time in Colorado admittedly at my loss here folks I had to Google “High Country;” it’s another term for the High Rockies and includes some of the most rugged terrain in the state. Presumably this is where the barley is grown but the only definitive statement from the producer is that the single malt is Coloradan. The percentages are a slight departure from the first release which included 15% Colorado single malt and won several awards including a double gold at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition.

The four whiskeys are blended and bottled by Coors Whiskey Co. in Bardstown Kentucky using water from the Rocky Mountains to cut to proof. It is made in partnership with the Bardstown Bourbon Company (BBC). BBC works with over 25 producers at various stages including custom distilling blending and aging. Coors Whiskey Co. also produces a barrel proof version of this batch (at 59.5% ABV) a cask finish series (a different blend that was finished in Imperial Porter barrels) and a small batch release (composed of the oldest whiskeys including an 8-year-old Colorado Single Malt).

The producer’s tasting note suggests that this offers notes of nuts caramel sugar cookies and various spice and herb aromas. It sounds like it will be a pretty straightforward bourbon-esque drink. Let’s explore.

Vital Stats: A blend of one Colorado single malt and three straight bourbons. Bottled at 47.5% ABV Mash bill: two-row barley malt and undisclosed other grains SRP $59.99/ 750ml bottle.

Appearance: Pale mahogany with golden undertone.

Nose: This initially offers up a warming sensation on the nose I attribute to the alcohol content that mutes the intensity of the aromatics. There are notes of fresh pastries red apples and roses. It builds into a strong smoky note like a freshly extinguished candle. There’s a nice blend of citrus and spice like clove-studded dried oranges. The grain side offers up notes of cherry pie raw yeast and warm wheat bread. Aromatically this is satisfying if not mind-blowing.

Palate: Here’s that warm candle wax note again that opens into lush vanilla and cola spices. There’s a strong yeasty note that I find a little unpleasant in its intensity. The body is moderate viscosity and a hint of grippy tannins. The finish is mildly peppery and bitter with notes of dried vanilla pods and cherries. It’s mild enough without any sharp elbows to be a component or star of a cocktail and was excellent in eggnog. It is true to its Coors Banquet roots decidedly inoffensive.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Sapphire RX 7900 XTX Nitro+ ships in a dark blue box with the Nitro+ brand logo taking pride of place on the front. On the back Sapphire highlights some key specifications with accompanying marketing text.

Inside we find a couple of pieces of documentation alongside a 5V ARGB cable used to synchronise the card's RGB lighting with your motherboard. Sapphire includes a GPU support bracket too the kind screws into the PCIe bracket and sit underneath the card itself to help keep it from sagging.

Taking a look at the Nitro+ I have to say this is one of the best looking graphics cards I can remember. Sapphire has opted for a grey shroud that it curves beautifully around both ends of the card before meeting the grey metal backplate on top. Although the grey section is metal the underlying shroud is made from plastic though it feels pretty rigid in the hand perhaps in part thanks to the internal aluminium-magnesium alloy that Sapphire claims is designed to improve ‘structural stiffness'.

As for the three fans these used Sapphire's ‘Angular Velocity' fan blade design with the company claiming up to 19% more airflow compared to the previous generation. Each fan measures approximately 98mm across and they continue to feature Sapphire's Quick Connect feature so they can be individually removed after taking out just a single screw per fan.

We can't get away from the fact that this is a big graphics card however far larger than AMD's reference design. The Nitro+ measures in at 320 x 135.75 x 71.6 mm so it's pretty long and over 3.5 slots thick making it longer and wider than the RTX 4090 Founders Edition. It also weighs in at 1.94KG.

A long RGB diffuser can also be found on either side of the shroud a new design feature for the Nitro+. I have to say the RGB is very well done the light itself is very evenly diffused with no hotspots but it doesn't look overly gaudy either.

Sapphire also includes a 5V ARGB header on the card so you can synchronise the lighting with your motherboard – do note that for this to work you must download the TriXX software and set the LED setting to ‘external source'.

A 4-pin PWM fan header is even placed next to the ARGB connection to allow a chassis fan to be controlled based on the GPU's own fan curve.

Flipping the card over we can note the grey metal backplate that matches the shroud. This doesn't quite extend the length of the card itself leaving a small gap between the end of the backplate and the internal metal frame that wraps around the end of the card.

A dual-BIOS switch is placed next to the I/O bracket. Technically this is a three-way switch as the setting furthest from the I/O bracket engages the primary BIOS the secondary BIOS is in the middle and furthest left Sapphire includes a software switch option. This simply lets you change between the two BIOS modes from within TriXX so there's no need to physically move a switch. For the BIOS modes themselves BIOS 1 has a 420W Total Board Power (TBP) and 2680MHz boost clock while BIOS has a 350W TBP and 2500MHz boost clock.

We can also note triple 8-pin PCIe power connectors – no 12VHPWR here. Sapphire also included two HDMI 2.1 and two DisplayPort 1.4 ports.

In terms of disassembly we'll start with a look at the PCB. Here Sapphire has opted for a 17-phase VRM with the memory seeing a 3-phase VRM in use. 70Amp Monolithic Power Systems MP87997 MOSFETs are used across the board with the GPU VRM controlled by a Monolithic MP2857 and a Monolithic MP2856 controlled is used for the memory VRM.

As for the cooler Sapphire has brought back Vapor-X for the Nitro+ meaning a copper vapour chamber is used to directly contract the GPU and memory modules while seven heatpipes draw heat out into the finstack. That aluminium-magnesium frame we've already mentioned serves a dual-purpose as it also contacts the VRM to provide extra cooling via some thermal pads.

Sapphire also uses thermal pads on the underside of the backplate though they are quite thick at approximately 4mm so I'm not sure how much thermal transfer there will be but I suppose it's better than nothing.

After our launch-day review of AMD's RX 7900 XTX went live earlier this month it's time to take a look at our first partner card. Sapphire's Nitro+ series has a long history of quality designs and we would hope for no different from this new RDNA 3-based card. Offering a very sleek design dual-BIOS and a power limit increased all the way up to 420W there's a lot going for this card on paper so let's see how much of an improvement it really is versus AMD's reference design.

The Sapphire Nitro+ series has undergone quite a change since we last looked at the previous generation of cards. Plenty of core features remain including Quick Connect Dual-BIOS (including a software switch mode) and the Tri-X fan system but alongside the aesthetic changes Sapphire has also brought back its Vapor-X technology meaning the GPU and memory modules are cooled via a vapour chamber.

It's certainly a looker and we've come to expect very good things from the Nitro+ brand over the years so let's find out if this RX 7900 XTX can live up to its billing.

RX 7900 XTX RX 7900 XT RX 6950 XT RX 6900 XT RX 6800 XT RX 6800 Architecture RDNA 3 RDNA 3 RDNA 2 RDNA 2 RDNA 2 RDNA 2 Manufacturing Process 5nm GCD + 6nm MCD 5nm GCD + 6nm MCD 7nm 7nm 7nm 7nm Transistor Count 57.7 billion 57.7 billion 26.8 billion 26.8 billion 26.8 billion 26.8 billion Die Size 300 mm² GCD 220 mm² MCD 300 mm² GCD 220 mm² MCD 519 mm² 519 mm² 519 mm² 519 mm² Ray Accelerators 96 84 80 80 72 60 Compute Units 96 84 80 80 72 60 Stream Processors 6144 5376 5120 5120 4608 3840 Game GPU Clock Up to 2300MHz Up to 2000 MHz Up to 2100MHz Up to 2015MHz Up to 2015MHz Up to 1815MHz Boost GPU Clock Up to 2500 MHz Up to 2400 MHz Up to 2310MHz Up to 2250MHz Up to 2250MHz Up to 2105MHz ROPs 192 192 128 128 128 96 AMD Infinity Cache 96MB 80MB 128MB 128MB 128MB 128MB Memory 24GB GDDR6 20GB GDDR6 16GB GDDR6 18Gbps 16GB GDDR6 16Gbps 16GB GDDR6 16GB GDDR6 Memory Bandwidth 960 GB/s 800 GB/s 576 GB/s 512 GB/s 512 GB/s 512 GB/s Memory Interface 384-bit 320-bit 256-bit 256-bit 256-bit 256-bit Board Power 355W 315W 335W 300W 300W 250W

First let's take a quick look at the specs. The RDNA 3 architecture has seen AMD transition to a chiplet-based design – a world first for a gaming GPU. We find a 300mm² Graphics Compute Die based on TSMC's 5nm node flanked by six 37mm² Memory Cache Dies. In total the Navi 31 GPU packs 57.7 billion transistors.

Internally the GCD makeup hasn't been radically changed compared to what we saw with RDNA 2. That means Navi 31 packs in 96 Compute Units each of which houses 64 Steam Processors for a total of 6144 shaders. There's also 96 Ray Accelerators – one per CU – and 192 ROPs.

As for clock speed AMD has de-coupled the clocks so the front-end and shaders can operate at different clock speeds in a bid to save power. With the RX 7900 XTX the shader clock features a rated game clock of up to 2300MHz and a boost of up to 2500MHz. Sapphire has increased this figure however with the primary BIOS operating with a 2680MHz boost clock.

Meanwhile the memory configuration has taken a step forward. The RX 7900 XTX packs 24GB of GDDR6 memory clocked at 20Gbps operating over a 384-bit memory interface for total memory bandwidth of 960 GB/s. 96MB of Infinity Cache is also present which allows AMD to claim an ‘effective memory bandwidth' of up to 3500 GB/s.

Power draw for the RX 7900 XTX is rated at 355W Total Board Power (TBP) but Sapphire has increased this further up to a 420W TBP for the Nitro+ using the primary BIOS though the secondary BIOS is more conservative at 350W.

The Sapphire RX 7900 XTX Nitro+ ships in a dark blue box with the Nitro+ brand logo taking pride of place on the front. On the back Sapphire highlights some key specifications with accompanying marketing text.

Inside we find a couple of pieces of documentation alongside a 5V ARGB cable used to synchronise the card's RGB lighting with your motherboard. Sapphire includes a GPU support bracket too the kind screws into the PCIe bracket and sit underneath the card itself to help keep it from sagging.

Taking a look at the Nitro+ I have to say this is one of the best looking graphics cards I can remember. Sapphire has opted for a grey shroud that it curves beautifully around both ends of the card before meeting the grey metal backplate on top. Although the grey section is metal the underlying shroud is made from plastic though it feels pretty rigid in the hand perhaps in part thanks to the internal aluminium-magnesium alloy that Sapphire claims is designed to improve ‘structural stiffness'.

As for the three fans these used Sapphire's ‘Angular Velocity' fan blade design with the company claiming up to 19% more airflow compared to the previous generation. Each fan measures approximately 98mm across and they continue to feature Sapphire's Quick Connect feature so they can be individually removed after taking out just a single screw per fan.

We can't get away from the fact that this is a big graphics card however far larger than AMD's reference design. The Nitro+ measures in at 320 x 135.75 x 71.6 mm so it's pretty long and over 3.5 slots thick making it longer and wider than the RTX 4090 Founders Edition. It also weighs in at 1.94KG.

A long RGB diffuser can also be found on either side of the shroud a new design feature for the Nitro+. I have to say the RGB is very well done the light itself is very evenly diffused with no hotspots but it doesn't look overly gaudy either.

Sapphire also includes a 5V ARGB header on the card so you can synchronise the lighting with your motherboard – do note that for this to work you must download the TriXX software and set the LED setting to ‘external source'.

A 4-pin PWM fan header is even placed next to the ARGB connection to allow a chassis fan to be controlled based on the GPU's own fan curve.

Flipping the card over we can note the grey metal backplate that matches the shroud. This doesn't quite extend the length of the card itself leaving a small gap between the end of the backplate and the internal metal frame that wraps around the end of the card.

A dual-BIOS switch is placed next to the I/O bracket. Technically this is a three-way switch as the setting furthest from the I/O bracket engages the primary BIOS the secondary BIOS is in the middle and furthest left Sapphire includes a software switch option. This simply lets you change between the two BIOS modes from within TriXX so there's no need to physically move a switch. For the BIOS modes themselves BIOS 1 has a 420W Total Board Power (TBP) and 2680MHz boost clock while BIOS has a 350W TBP and 2500MHz boost clock.

We can also note triple 8-pin PCIe power connectors – no 12VHPWR here. Sapphire also included two HDMI 2.1 and two DisplayPort 1.4 ports.

In terms of disassembly we'll start with a look at the PCB. Here Sapphire has opted for a 17-phase VRM with the memory seeing a 3-phase VRM in use. 70Amp Monolithic Power Systems MP87997 MOSFETs are used across the board with the GPU VRM controlled by a Monolithic MP2857 and a Monolithic MP2856 controlled is used for the memory VRM.

As for the cooler Sapphire has brought back Vapor-X for the Nitro+ meaning a copper vapour chamber is used to directly contract the GPU and memory modules while seven heatpipes draw heat out into the finstack. That aluminium-magnesium frame we've already mentioned serves a dual-purpose as it also contacts the VRM to provide extra cooling via some thermal pads.

Sapphire also uses thermal pads on the underside of the backplate though they are quite thick at approximately 4mm so I'm not sure how much thermal transfer there will be but I suppose it's better than nothing.

We run each benchmark/game three times and present mean averages in our graphs. We use FrameView to measure average frame rates as well as 1% low values across our three runs.

3DMark Time Spy is a DirectX 12 benchmark test for Windows 10 gaming PCs. Time Spy is one of the first DirectX 12 apps to be built the right way from the ground up to fully realize the performance gains that the new API offers. With its pure DirectX 12 engine which supports new API features like asynchronous compute explicit multi-adapter and multi-threading Time Spy is the ideal test for benchmarking the latest graphics cards. (UL).

3DMark Time Spy Extreme shows performance coming in 3% higher than AMD's reference card making the Nitro+ 8% faster than an RTX 4080 Founders Edition.

Here we test five games all at 3840×2160 resolution using maximum image quality settings.

Despite the factory overclock our game benchmarks show only limited gains for the Nitro+ over AMD's reference design. We saw at most a 4% boost to frame rates in Horizon Zero Dawn but typically the figure was just 2% as shown in Cyberpunk 2077 and Resident Evil Village. As ever the factory overclock alone is not a real reason to buy one card over another as the differences are very minor.

Here we present the average clock speed for each graphics card while running Cyberpunk 2077 for 30 minutes. We use GPU-Z to record the GPU core frequency during gameplay. We calculate the average core frequency during the 30 minute run to present here.

Getting testing under way with a look at clock speed we can immediately notice how the extra power budget afforded to the Nitro+ directly translates into significantly raised clock speeds. BIOS 1 averaged 2751MHz over our thirty minute stress test making it about170MHz faster than the reference design. BIOS 2 does run noticeably slower as a result of its reduced power limit but even then overall performance closely matches AMD's reference card.

For our temperature testing we measure the peak GPU core temperature under load. A reading under load comes from running Cyberpunk 2077 for 30 minutes.

As this is the first AIB card we've tested we've not got any other comparison points apart from the AMD reference design but we can see the Nitro+ BIOS 1 offers similar thermal performance to the MBA design. It's important to remember that these are out of the box thermal results so noise levels are not taken into account. BIOS 2 meanwhile runs about 5C cooler than BIOS 1 as a result of its lower power limit.

We take our noise measurements with the sound meter positioned 1 foot from the graphics card. I measured the noise floor to be 32 dBA thus anything above this level can be attributed to the graphics cards. The power supply is passive for the entire power output range we tested all graphics cards in while all CPU and system fans were disabled. A reading under load comes from running Cyberpunk 2077 for 30 minutes for 30 minutes.

The thermal results look even better when taking noise levels into account – the Nitro+ operates at just 35dBa so that's a healthy 6dBa reduction compared to AMD's reference card. Interestingly noise levels are the same between BIOS 1 and BIOS 2 with both modes peaking at 36% fan speed or around 1480rpm in our testing.

We did however notice some coil whine that was present on our sample. A sound test of this is shown in the video and you can hear it over our system's case fans. It's not the worst I've ever heard but it is noticeable.

Following on from our stock thermal and acoustic testing here we re-test the operating temperature of the GPU but with noise levels normalised to 40dBa. This allows us to measure the efficiency of the overall cooling solution as varying noise levels as a result of more aggressive fan curves are no longer a factor.

To produce 40dBa of noise we increased fan speed to 48% or about 1950rpm. This saw the Nitro+ run comfortably cooler than the reference design offering a 7C reduction in terms of GPU thermals but a 12C reduction when looking at the hot spot temperature. This is also while operating at a higher power limit too as noise-normalised thermals don't take power into account making the design even more impressive.

We use Nvidia PCAT to measure power draw of the graphics card only with readings from both the PCIe slot and the PCIe power cables combined into a single figure. We use Cyberpunk 2077 (4K) for this testing.

Sapphire has pumped up the power significantly with the Nitro+ with the card drawing 440W in our testing – clearly the extra 8-pin power connector is not just for show!

That does mean overall efficiency of the card is significantly reduced – with performance per Watt down by 17% compared to the reference card but hopefully we can tap into some of this extra power headroom when overclocking…

For our manual overclocking tests we used AMD Wattman. Our best results are as below.

After having very limited success with our launch day RX 7900 XTX we spent a bit more time overclocking the Nitro+. One key change we made was adjusting the voltage slider and undervolting really helps with this GPU. We lowered this by 60mV down from 1150 to 1090mV while setting a maximum GPU clock of 3050MHz. The memory clock was adjusted to 2720MHz with the power limit maximised at +15%.

This overclock netted decent gains in our testing far better that what we saw on launch day with improvements coming in around 8% above the Nitro+ running its default clocks. In some cases the 7900 XTX was not too far off from the RTX 4090 though of course it never fully caught up.

The downside to pushing a custom card like this to its limit is power draw increasing significantly. We measured just under 490W power draw in Cyberpunk though as we show in the video this even exceeded 510W in Resident Evil Village! Considering the 7900 XTX was still always slower than a stock RTX 4090 that's a heck of a lot of juice…

Having put the card through its paces over the last few weeks it's not hard for me to come to the conclusion that the Sapphire RX 7900 XTX Nitro+ is one of the finest AMD-based graphics cards I have tested over the last few years.

For me this all starts with the design which really is a cut above most of the cards on the market. The shade of grey used really appeals to me while the subtle curves and RGB light bar add a level of sophistication we don't always get from a gaming graphics card.

The Vapor-X cooler also performs very well. Granted at this point we can’t say how much better or worse it is compared to any other AIB model as this is our first custom card review but the Nitro+ managed to run 7C cooler than AMD's reference card while also drawing about 80W more power so that’s not bad at all.

Factoring in the solid dual-BIOS implementation the reasonable overclocking headroom (once you bring undervolting into play) and just how quiet this card is considering it's pulling 440W and it is very hard not to be impressed with what Sapphire has done here. It really is quite an expertly-engineered graphics card.

The one thing that is just giving me cause for concern right now is – you guessed it! – pricing. While currently out of stock here in the UK the card launched at about £1300 at OCUK making it £100 more expensive than some RTX 4080s currently on the market.

This was a worry for me when the 7900 XTX launched. It's all well and good for the reference card to come in at £999 – but custom cards still need to be cheaper than the RTX 4080 for the 7900 XTX to offer any meaningful value. As good as Sapphire’s design is if you can get something with similar overall performance but with DLSS support and superior ray tracing for £100 less…. well the 7900 XTX becomes very hard to justify.

To be clear the Sapphire RX 7900 XTX Nitro+ is an absolutely fantastic custom design and if you do pick one up I have no doubt you will be very pleased with it. The 7900 XTX just can’t demand a price premium over the RTX 4080 as to me it simply doesn't make sense all things considered.

It is currently out of stock but the Nitro+ is listed on Overclockers UK HERE.

Discuss on our Facebook page HERE.

Pros

Beautiful design.

Runs noticeably quieter than the reference card.

GPU temperatures fell by 7C compared to the reference design when noise-normalised.

Dual-BIOS.

On-board PWM fan header.

Cons

Some audible coil whine.

Pricing is concerning – 7900 XTX doesn't make sense if it's more expensive than RTX 4080.

KitGuru says: We love what Sapphire has done with the Nitro+. If pricing remains around the £1300 mark however it's going to be very hard to justify spending this much on an RX 7900 XTX when RTX 4080s can be had for £100 less.

As many social media users continue to share their experiences with and post about the chain’s new beverage it may contain even more caffeine than expected.

On December 9th yet another content creator went viral after posting a highly viewed TikTok video in which she spoke about the caffeine she consumed through Panera’s Charged Lemonade and why she thinks the drinks should be “illegal.”

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Panera Bread (@panerabread)

First Off What’s In A Charged Lemonade?

Panera’s Charged Lemonade comes in three flavors; Strawberry Lemon Mint Mango Yuzu Citrus and Fuji Apple Cranberry. As reported by The Daily Dot a large Charged Lemonade has over 100 grams of sugar and 390 milligrams of caffeine.

This the outlet emphasizes means that there are almost 13 milligrams of caffeine and nearly 4 grams of sugar per ounce (which is “more sugar and caffeine per fluid ounce” than a can of Monster Energy).

According to Panera’s website these lemonades are the “ultimate energy drink guaranteed to charge up your day.” Powered by “Clean caffeine from guarana and green coffee extract” these caffeinated lemonades feature “refreshing mango cranberry or strawberry mint flavors.” The site also now states in bold “Plant-based and Clean with as much caffeine as our Dark Roast coffee.”

Panera Customer Goes Viral After Sharing Her Thoughts On New ‘Charged Lemonade’

In the video creator Sarah Baus details one remote work day she had at her local Panera cafe that left her feeling overwhelmed with caffeine. “I have learned something that should be illegal 100% should be illegal and it has to do with this drink — give me a second” she said in the video while explaining what led her to film herself “I work at Panera — no I don’t — I work in a Panera.”

In the clip she is seen holding a Mango Yuzu Citrus Charged Lemonade from Panera which could explain her frenzied state. Baus then added that works inside of a Panera location using the chain’s free Wi-Fi rather than opting for a more expensive co-working space. “When I’m at my local Panera they have free refills” Baus went on giving viewers a better look at the Charged Lemonade in her hand.

She noted that while she was aware that her drink of choice had caffeine in it she was astounded to learn just how much was within it. “Sitting there I’ll drink four or five of these and I was always like ‘Man when I work at Panera I feel great! I feel awesome! I get so much done!'” she said.

Baus then said that later on she visited through a Panera drive-thru with her husband who has Type 1 diabetes when she felt a Charged Lemonade craving. Her husband was interested in trying the drink for himself and looked up the nutritional facts to manage his blood sugar. To the couple’s surprise they found out that a regular-sized Charged Lemonade (particularly the Mango Yuzu flavor Baus liked) contains 82 grams of sugar and 260 milligrams of caffeine.

“Espresso has 63 milligrams of caffeine” Baus noted in the video adding “I don’t drink coffee I don’t have caffeine very much … I thought!” She then concluded her story by explaining that the most caffeine she ever has is an occasional Diet Coke which has 46 milligrams of caffeine (per 12-ounce can).

“I feel like the Hulk. And I’m drinking these and I really like them. I said that I’m gonna water them down. But Panera who’s gonna create a product with 263 milligrams of caffeine? Look what you’re doing!” she said to the chain in the video.

After inspiring Twitter memes and going viral on yet another social media platform Baus sat down with TODAY to discuss her time at Panera Charged Lemonade and how she will continue to visit the chain and not consume so much caffeine.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Panera Bread (@panerabread)

“I’m generally a very bubbly hyper person energetic. And so I was just like ‘Whoa I feel really good. I feel very very happy. I feel very me” Baus told the outlet adding that she is a member of the chain’s Unlimited Sip Club which is why she was able to drink so much that day.

Baus then detailed her realization when it came to the drink’s caffeine content. “It struck me that I actually felt quite jittery I couldn’t stop moving. I just wanted to keep doing things. My mind was going so fast and I wondered why I was so productive but now I know” she said.

She added that Panera did a sufficient job of putting the caffeine content on their website and acknowledged that she should have checked it before drinking the beverage. “I just kind of assumed it had a normal amount of caffeine I didn’t really put a ton of thought into it” she said “I should have looked.”

Below are the top ten most-searched product launches on the FoodBev website.

KFC fried chicken-flavoured chips

In September KFC partnered with PepsiCo Foods Canada to create a new flavour of potato chip for the Ruffles brand.

The collaboration saw the companies add the flavour of KFC’s signature herb and spice mix to Ruffles’ ridged chips.

The Ruffles KFC Original Recipe Chicken-flavoured potato chips were available for a limited time in major retailers across Canada.

Monster partner with Lewis Hamilton on sugar-free drink

As the energy drink category continues to soar last month saw Monster Energy team up with Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton to launch a new zero-sugar energy drink.

The zero-sugar and zero-calorie drink is available in a peach nectarine flavour and is available to buy in singular cans with a four-pack multipack set to join the range in the New Year.

Martin Attock vice president of commercial development at Coca-Cola Europacifc Partners GB – which is the manufacturer and distributor of the Monster Energy portfolio – said: “This innovation brings together two cultural icons and we’re confident it’s going to disrupt the category and drive sales”.

Myprotein and Perfect Day launch new animal-free whey protein powder

Earlier this year popular sports nutrition brand Myprotein and food tech startup Perfect Day partnered to launch a new animal-free whey protein powder called Whey Forward.

Whey Forward is made with Perfect Day’s animal-free whey protein which uses precision fermentation to create an identical whey protein from microflora instead of coming from animals. According to the company the end result is identical to the whey protein found in cow’s milk and provides 20 grams of protein per serving. The animal-free protein is available in three flavours: mint chocolate chip salted caramel and chocolate brownie.

The powder is an animal-free protein solution that does not compromise on the nutrition taste or texture of traditional whey protein with a reduce environmental impact.

Doritos launch Doritos Dips in two new flavours

Last month popular crisp brand Doritos expanded its dip portfolio with the addition of two new flavours spicy nacho and cool ranch jalapeno.

With the goal to deliver new and unexpected experiences to consumers the Doritos Dip Spicy Nacho is a spicy twist on the classic Doritos Nacho Cheese flavour while the Doritos Dip Cool Ranch Jalapeno is inspired by Doritos Cool Ranch with an “intensified” flavour and a hint of jalapeno.

Frito-Lay’s vice president of brand marketing Leslie Vesper commented: “We hope Doritos Dips help fans think outside the box just like we’re thinking outside the chip bag with this innovation”.

Kellogg’s and Disney partner on Hocus Pocus 2-themed cereal

In August Kellogg’s partnered with Disney to launch a limited-edition Hocus Pocus 2-themed cereal.

The cereal featured a mixed berry flavour with purple orange and yellow star-shaped pieces topped with green and purple flecks

“Disney’s Hocus Pocus has been a part of family Halloween traditions for years” said Sadie Garcia director of brand marketing at Kellogg. “Now with Kellogg’s Disney Hocus Pocus 2 cereal families can celebrate [the] spooky season…”

The cereal was available at retailers across the US for a limited time.

Red Bull release a Winter Edition Fig Apple flavour

In time for the colder season Red Bull released a new energy drink Winter Edition Fig Apple flavour. The can features notes of apple fig and caramel and was available on the US market during October ahead of the winter season.

The drink’s main ingredient is water and it contains caffeine taurine and vitamins B6 and B12

PepsiCo launch new Rockstar energy drink flavours with added collagen

Energy drinks proved to be a booming category this year with many beverage companies adding more functionality to their drinks. PepsiCo launched two new variants of its Rockstar Recovery drinks but with added ingredients including collagen and vitamin C.

The two flavours – Pineapple Coconut and Mango Lemonade – join the existing variants but with additional ingredients including coconut water collagen and 100% of consumers’ recommended daily dose of vitamin C to help “reset and hydrate for any activity.”

N!ck’s launch ice cream in collaboration with gaming platform Minecraft

Another limited edition launch better-for-you snack brand N!ck’s launched a collection of light ice creams in square pints in collaboration with Minecraft.

The collection marries the innovation of two Swedish brands merging N!ck’s patented food science technology and flavour expertise with Minecraft’s game elements to create treats that are a healthier alternative to the full-fat and high-calorie ice creams on the market.

The two companies were brought together by their shared heritage and a mutual desire to provide healthier snack and dessert options in and beyond the gaming community.

The brand released four keto-friendly flavours including a creamy mint ice cream with peppermint chips a creamy birthday cake ice cream swirled with strawberry and sprinkles a rich chocolate ice cream with gold mines of peanut butter cups and a sweet apple pie ice cream with a swirl of graham crackers.

The ice cream collection dons the iconic square pixelation design from the game. To this end each pint is packaged in distinctive square containers a departure from N!ck’s traditional round pints as a physical embodiment of Minecraft’s signature in-game blocks.

Myprotein add two new ready-to-drink Clear Whey Protein drinks to its portfolio

This year proved that functional beverages do not stop at energy drinks as we witnessed a huge rise in the popularity of protein shakes. Following on from its animal-free protein powder collaboration with Perfect Day Myprotein launched two new non-HFSS protein-rich beverages.

The drinks called protein waters are available in peach tea and orange and mango flavours made with the brand’s clear whey protein ingredient.

The zero-fat and zero-sugar drinks use hydrolysed whey protein isolate and were designed to provide a light and refreshing alternative that’s more like juice than a milky protein shake.

Mondelēz launch limited edition Toblerone Golden

Joining in on the limited edition snack wave Mondelēz International expanded its confectionery lineup with the addition of Toblerone Golden earlier this year.

Toblerone Golden features the brand’s classic crunchy nougat with golden caramel chocolate which is made with a caramelised blend of white chocolate newly developed for UK & Ireland markets.

In the first year of this four-year project the researchers spotted sizable numbers of seabirds and whales — including the largest animal on Earth — in the Oregon and Northern California areas that could one day host floating wind farms.

The OSU researchers are taking to the sea to the air and listening underwater to document which seabirds whales and dolphins forage in and around the parcels put up for lease by the Interior Department for offshore wind farm development.

“The (continental) shelf and the slope have high abundance and high density of marine mammals and seabirds” reported OSU Marine Mammal Institute director Lisa Ballance after the first two of seven planned research cruises were in the books.

MOSAIC project seabird and marine mammal survey

“There are quite a lot of large whales out there quite a number” said Ballance who serves as principal investigator on the project. “Humpbacks are quite abundant. Increasingly blue whales are quite abundant. We also see a whale that is less familiar to most people called a sei whale. It looks a lot like a blue whale not quite as big but a very large animal.”

Blue whales sei whales as well as some sub-populations of humpbacks are federally-listed as endangered. The Pacific Northwest’s critically endangered Southern Resident killer whales also travel along the outer coast seasonally.

The array of seabirds spotted by the researchers included threatened marbled murrelets along with impressive long-distance travelers such as black-footed albatrosses and Laysan albatrosses. Ballance reserved special admiration for the abundant sooty shearwaters a seasonal visitor to Pacific Northwest waters that migrate all the way from breeding colonies near New Zealand.

Ballance said her team needs to do a lot more analysis before she would consider making any statements about whether anchoring massive floating wind turbines amid this maritime abundance would create problems.

A spokeswoman for German multinational energy company RWE Renewables the winning bidder for one of the Northern California offshore leases said it was still very early in the site development process. For that reason the company declined Monday to comment on the initial wildlife survey results.

Early on the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management identified the risk of whale entanglements in floating platform moorings and cabling as a concern. The agency contracted with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to create a computer simulation of whale interactions with different wind farm configurations the results of which have not yet been published.

""It is important to note that a federal offshore wind lease only grants a company the exclusive right to submit plans to BOEM for activities on their lease. It does not grant approval for the construction of an offshore wind facility"" BOEM public affairs officer John Romero said in an email Saturday.

Earlier this month the federal treasury reaped $757 million from auctioning leases to five patches of ocean off Morro Bay and Humboldt County California. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management tentatively plans to auction two more leases off of Coos Bay and Brookings Oregon sometime in the second half of 2023. The lease areas begin around 14 miles off the coastline and extend to 46 to 65 miles offshore. This means the wind farms should be out of sight from shore on all but the clearest days.

The OSU study is just one of more than a dozen commissioned by federal agencies to scope out the environmental economic and social changes that large-scale renewable energy development might bring to the Pacific Coast. The objective as laid out by the U.S. Department of Energy last year is to ""inform offshore wind siting permitting and help protect wildlife and fisheries as offshore wind deployment increases.""

121922TB_OSU-wind-farm-wildlife-cruise-graphic_august_2022.png

The $2 million grant to the OSU-led team piggybacks on other projects already underway by the university’s Marine Mammal Institute and with outside collaborators. In addition to visual surveys from research ships one scientist is regularly tagging along with Coast Guard helicopter crews to survey from the air. Ballance said the project will also incorporate two years worth of undersea hydrophone recordings now deployed satellite tracking tags attached to a small number of blue whales and another prong to collect flight height info on seabirds to assess the likelihood of collisions with turbine blades.

Even though wind leasing is well underway the final report and maps produced by the OSU researchers are not due to be delivered until mid-2026. But a permitting timeline provided by BOEM suggests the Oregon and California floating offshore wind farms will undergo an extraordinarily long review process. The agency said site assessment and surveys could take five to six years. Further technical and formal environmental reviews public comment plus construction and operations permitting adds another two to four years.

That permitting timeline aligns with RWE Renewables’ estimate that its California floating wind farm will begin operations by the mid-2030s.

The continental shelf along the Pacific Northwest coast drops away too fast to fix wind turbine towers to the seafloor as is done along the U.S. East Coast and in northern Europe. That means the Biden administration and state goals to achieve significant volumes of clean electricity generation from offshore wind in the next decade will need to rely on floating turbines that are still undergoing refinement. Even though building offshore will be more expensive and complicated it attracts energy companies because of the ability to capture stronger and more consistent winds with bigger turbine blades than are typically available on land.

There are only four utility-scale floating wind farms in operation worldwide at present — in Portugal Scotland and Norway. None of those projects are in waters as deep as contemplated off Oregon. The proposed lease areas off of Coos Bay Gold Beach and Brookings are 400 feet deep at their shallowest and the water depths easily exceed 1000 feet as you move further offshore.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vcGhvdG9zLWhvdy1zdHlsZS1hbmQtc2hhcGVzLW9mLWJyYXMtZXZvbHZlZC1vdmVyLXRpbWUtMjAyMi0xMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Photos: How the Style and Shapes of Bras Have Evolved Over Time,"Depictions of women wearing bra-like garments were found in a fourth-century mosaic in a Sicilian castle.

Although it's hard to pinpoint when the first iteration of bra was invented experts know bust support has been around for centuries. Colleen Hill the curator of costume and accessories for the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology wrote for Google Arts & Culture that the origins of the bra can be traced back more than 1500 years.

A mosaic in the Villa Romana del Casale in Sicily Italy depicts women wearing supportive garments while engaging in physical activity like lifting weights and throwing a discus.

In 2012 researcher Beatrix Nutz announced she found four bras in a 2008 excavation of the Lengberg Castle in Lengberg Austria. Nutz said in an interview with Smithsonian Magazine that the bras which date back to the 15th century may have been used to ""contain and flatten"" large breasts.",,,,,,

The factoring company collects payment on those customer invoices retaining a fee for its services. Working with a factoring company helps businesses access cash quickly especially if they have difficulty obtaining financing from traditional sources like banks.

In 2021 the U.S. factoring industry was valued at $147 billion. The demand for factoring companies continues to increase as businesses look for additional financing alternatives to convert their receivables into cash more quickly.

If you’re looking for the best factoring company for your business we’ve narrowed the options down to eight by comparing fees speed of service term flexibility and offerings for specific industries. Read on for our reviews of the best invoice factoring companies in America.

Factoring Companies Guide

Main things to know when choosing a factoring company

There are many factoring companies in the U.S. and if you don’t have a good understanding of how to choose one you might put your business at risk. To prevent this from happening here are some things you should know when selecting a factoring company for your business.

Factoring companies can be industry-specific

When choosing a factoring company it’s important to consider whether it specializes in your industry. This can be beneficial because industry-specific factoring companies will better understand the challenges and opportunities specific to your business. Among the many sectors factoring companies offer their services to transportation and construction companies are the most common.

For example a factoring company specializing in the trucking industry (also called freight factoring companies) may be better equipped to handle the unique challenges and requirements of trucking businesses. If you choose a company with little or no understanding of your industry the costs may outweigh your savings.

Understanding the entire contract is a must

Before entering into any agreement with a factoring company it’s important to carefully read and understand the contract. This will ensure that you know exactly what you’re agreeing to and help you avoid potential pitfalls or misunderstandings. Pay particular attention to the terms and conditions of the agreement as well as factoring costs and any additional fees involved. This will save you from any hidden fees now and in the future and allow you to make the most of the services you’re paying for.

Choose either a recourse or non-recourse agreement

Understanding the difference between recourse and non-recourse factoring agreements is essential in choosing the best factoring company for your business. In a recourse agreement the factoring company has the right to pursue you for payment if your customer fails to pay. In a non-recourse agreement the factoring company assumes the risk of the customer not paying.

Both types of agreements have their benefits and drawbacks so be sure to discuss the differences with prospective factoring companies to determine which will work best for your business.

What is the average cost of factoring companies?

On average factoring companies charge factoring rates around 1%-5% of the amount of the total invoices collected but this varies based on the industry.

Industry-specific rates are summarized in the table below.

Industry Factoring Rate General Business 1.15% – 4.5% Staffing 1.15% – 3.5% Transportation 1.15% – 5% Medical 2.5% – 4% Construction 2.5% – 3.5%

How do factoring companies work?

Factoring companies provide businesses with a way to quickly access cash by purchasing their unpaid invoices. This allows businesses to receive payment for their invoices immediately rather than waiting for customers to pay.

To use a factoring company a business first sends the company a copy of its outstanding invoices. The factoring company will then advance the business a portion of the invoices typically between 70% and 90%. The business can then use the cash advance to meet its immediate financial needs.

Once the customer pays the invoice the factoring company will receive the full payment. The factoring company will then subtract any fees or charges and pay the remainder to the business.

Factoring companies typically charge either a flat fee or a percentage of the invoice for their services. The exact terms and fees will vary depending on the factoring company and the specifics of the agreement.

Factoring can be a useful tool for businesses that need cash upfront and are unable to obtain traditional forms of financing. It can also be a good option for businesses that have difficulty qualifying for conventional loans. However it’s important for businesses to carefully consider the terms and fees of any agreement with a factoring company before entering into a contract.

Why do you need a factoring company?

There are several reasons why it can be a good idea to use a factoring company. First factoring can provide businesses with immediate access to working capital. This can be especially helpful for companies that need to pay suppliers or meet other financial obligations but are unable to obtain other forms of financing.

Second factoring can be a good option for businesses that have difficulty qualifying for business loans or lines of credit. This can be because of a poor credit history a lack of collateral or other factors. Factoring companies often have more flexible requirements than traditional lenders and can provide financing to businesses that may not be able to obtain it elsewhere.

Third factoring can help businesses improve their cash flow and financial stability. By selling outstanding invoices to a factoring company businesses can receive payment immediately rather than waiting for customers to pay. This can help companies avoid cash flow problems build up their credit score and improve their financial outlook.

Fourth factoring can help businesses focus on their core operations. Companies can free up time and resources to focus on other aspects of their business by using a factoring company to handle their invoicing and collections.

While factoring may not be the right funding option for every business it can be a valuable tool for businesses that need immediate access to cash have difficulty qualifying for traditional loans or want to improve their cash flow and financial stability.

Factoring companies FAQs

What is the best way to record payments from a factoring company?

The best way to record payments from a factoring company is to create a separate account in your accounting system specifically for factoring transactions. This will allow you to easily track and manage these transactions separately from your other financial activities ensuring they're properly accounted for in your records.

First create a new account in your system using an appropriate name such as ""Factoring Receivables"" or ""Factoring Receipts."" Once the account is created you can use it to record all of your transactions with the factoring company.

When you receive a payment from the factoring company record it as a credit to the factoring account and a debit to the cash account. This will increase the factoring account's balance and decrease the cash account's balance indicating you've received payment from the factoring company.

You should also record any fees or charges associated with the factoring transactions. These can be recorded as a debit to the factoring account and a credit to an expense account such as ""Factoring Fees.""

What are the record-keeping duties of a factoring company in the U.S.?

Factoring companies in the U.S. are responsible for keeping detailed records of their financial transactions. Their record-keeping duties begin when a client business submits all the information regarding their accounts receivable. This is a crucial process as it dictates whether or not the company is eligible for factoring services.

It also needs to keep records of any fees or charges associated with its services such as interest or service charges. Every factoring company should maintain accurate records of the accounts receivable it purchases from its clients as well as the payments it collects on those accounts.

Factoring companies also need to keep track of their clients' creditworthiness and provide regular reports on their accounts' status. These record-keeping duties are essential for ensuring the smooth operation of the business and meeting regulatory requirements.

How can I cancel my factoring company service?

The process for canceling a factoring company's service can vary depending on the terms of your contract and the company's policies. Generally it's best to review your contract carefully and communicate openly with the factoring company to ensure that the cancellation process goes smoothly.

In general the first step to cancel your contract with your factoring company should be to inform it of your intention to terminate the service. You'll likely need to provide written notice of your decision via email or postal mail. Carefully review the terms of your contract with the company as it may specify a minimum notice period or other requirements for canceling the service.

Once you've notified the factoring company of your intention to cancel you'll need to provide it with a list of all outstanding accounts receivable that have been sold to it. It will then work with you to collect any remaining payments on those accounts and finalize the cancellation process. Follow any instructions the factoring company provides to ensure the cancellation process goes smoothly.

In some cases you may be required to pay a cancellation fee or other charges if you terminate the service before the end of the contract period.

How do I list the invoices I sell to a factoring company on my taxes?

The IRS has a way of analyzing receivables that use a factoring company's services. In determining the tax liability from this type of financing the following information is required:

Name and location of the factoring company

Relationship between the seller and factoring company

Whether both parties are part of a consolidated group

Name of the accounting firm that may have assisted in the factoring agreement

Type of factoring agreement

Business tax returns of the seller company

Securitization process if any

In some cases you may be able to claim certain deductions or credits related to the sale of the invoices such as interest paid on the accounts receivable or fees charged by the factoring company.

You may also need to provide documentation to the IRS to support the income you've reported from selling invoices to a factoring company. This may include copies of the invoices sold as well as any contracts or other agreements related to the sale.

Overall it's best to consult with a tax professional or refer to the IRS guidelines for specific information on how to properly report the sale of invoices to a factoring company on your taxes.

What type of businesses use factoring?

While any type of company is welcome to try the services of a factoring company to help improve their cash flow factoring is most common in the trucking and freight manufacturing energy and oil telecom staffing construction and commercial food service industries.

How long does it take to qualify for a factoring company?

Overall the length of time it takes to qualify for a factoring company varies depending on the specific requirements of the company and the complexity of your situation. Generally applying for and obtaining approval for factoring can take anywhere from a few days to several weeks.

The first step in the qualification process is to submit an application to the factoring company. This typically involves providing information about your business such as your industry the size of your company and the type of products or services you offer. The factoring company will use this information to assess your eligibility for its services and to determine whether you meet its credit criteria.

Once your application has been submitted the factoring company will review your information and conduct a credit check to assess your financial health and creditworthiness. This process can take several days or even weeks.

If your application is approved the factoring company will provide you with an agreement outlining its services' terms and conditions. This will typically include information on factoring fees and any other requirements or restrictions. Carefully review the terms of the agreement and ask any questions you may have before signing.

How we found the best factoring companies

Invoice factoring can help business owners increase cash flow quickly but a big part of the process is choosing the right company to work with. These are the factors we considered when preparing this list:

Maximum funding

When deciding what factoring company to work with it’s essential to know maximum funding amounts they can provide. You may have better odds of approval with factoring companies that have higher funding limits as they tend to have a sizable amount of money ready to fund multiple contracts.

Discount rates

Discount rates are the payments made for a factoring company’s services. We sought out companies offering low discount rates without sacrificing service quality.

Advance rates

Advance rates are the percentages a factoring company is willing to extend to its clients. We favored factoring companies with higher advance rates.

Factoring fees

Aside from the discount rates charged other factoring fees are sometimes added to the overall cost of a service package. These include transfer fees (ACH or wire) and origination fees for new customers. We looked for companies who are upfront about the fees they charge.

""[Exports will grow] by about 15%. But one must understand that this is far from the limit"" Izvestia quoted Likhachev as saying in remarks published early on Monday.

The growth comes among others from contracts already being implemented supplies of fuel enriched uranium products as well as conversion services Likhachev said. It also includes the construction of 23 nuclear power units at projects in a dozen countries he added.

Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine 10 months ago Rosatom has avoided Western sanctions although the United States was weighing them earlier this year.

""Even in such conditions our portfolio of foreign orders for 10 years ahead is stable at the level of $200 billion"" Likhachev said. ""This year we will overcome a psychologically important barrier in the supply of our products abroad in the amount of $10 billion.""

Rosatom has been in talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency about a safe zone around Ukraine's Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant Europe's largest which Russian troops captured in March.

In August Rosatom and its Finnish partner Fennovoima have filed claims for billions of dollars in damages from each other over Fennovoima's decision to cancel a planned nuclear power plant in Finland.

The Fennovoima consortium in which Russia's state-owned Rosatom has a 34% minority holding in May terminated a contract for Rosatom to build a nuclear power plant in the cape of Hanhikivi in northwest Finland citing delays and then increased risks resulting from the war in Ukraine.

Earlier in December Rosatom said that the Dispute Review Board (DRB) an arbitration panel that settles international contract disputes ruled the Finnish termination to be ""illegal"".

Fennovoima said on its website on Dec. 15 that the Board's recommendation was neither final nor binding and that the consortium had filed a notice of ""dissatisfaction"" with the Board.

Although there is weakness in the ad market driven by an uncertain economic outlook and expectations that a potential recession will crush consumer demand ad-tech stocks remain comparatively resilient. This is because marketers are now more selective with their advertising budget which means they are looking to spend those ad dollars efficiently. They now rely more on data and technology when it comes to marketing their products and services. Ad-tech firms are also benefiting from the transformation of ad spending from linear TV to connected TV.

In the beginning of December media buyer GroupM forecast that traditional TV ad spending would decline by 3.8% to $64.4 billion in 2023 with the drop offset by a 19% increase in ad spending on connected TV to $13.3 billion. The media buyer sees a similar pattern in 2024 and 2025 as well while CTV spending will accelerate by 1.8% to $20 billion by 2026.

Jeff Green founder and CEO at The Trade Desk Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) announced that his company’s revenues rose 31% in the third quarter of 2022. In an earnings call he said:

Here is what Alger has to say about Magnite Inc. (NASDAQ:MGNI) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:

“Magnite provides an advertising supply side platform for publishers. The technology helps publishers such as network television stations or cable news providers automate the sale of digital advertising inventory across different formats and channels like desktop mobile video audio connected TV and over-the-top TV. Publishers monetize their digital advertising inventory by using Magnite’s platform to access a global market of ad buyers including advertising agencies that use supply side platforms. Magnite also helps sellers decrease costs and protect their brands and user experience. Magnite receives ad inventory from sellers and optimizes publishers’ revenue yields by processing the highest buyer bids. Currently Magnite keeps approximately 10% of ad spend as revenue (i.e. take rate) and passes on the remainder of the ad spend to publishers. Magnite’s clients include many of the world’s leading publishers of websites and mobile applications and the company believes that its platform reaches approximately 1 billion individuals globally. Shares of Magnite underperformed in the second quarter due to the growth market selloff and slower-than-expected growth in connected TV during the first three months of this year. We believe the 32% growth in connected TV was below expectations and due to a one-time issue with one of the company’s publishing partners that ran out of advertising inventory. Management noted the issue has been fixed and the company saw strong reaccelerating growth in April.

If you've spent Boxing Day on the sofa eating copious amounts of chocolate coins and binge-watching the newest Netflix series Treason (us too) then you're probably wondering what the hell was going on during that tense final episode.

To recap: Treason is Netflix's newest drama series starring Charlie Cox as the deputy head for MI6 Adam. When a plot to get rid of the current head of MI6 unfurls Adam steps in but soon finds his new role is a lot trickier than it first appears thanks to people and secrets from his past coming back into his life.

The five part series dropped today (26th December) and it's safe to say we're pretty much obsessed with the intriguing espionage story. In fact we've already raced to the tense final episode and there is a lot to unpack.

Netflix

So what actually happened in the final episode of Treason? This is the ending of the series explained.

The ending of Treason explained

The final episode of Treason opens up with Adam (Charlie Cox) calling Malik to arrange a meeting and Maddy (Oona Chaplin) sending a message to Audrey (Alex Kingston) that Adam has been set up.

Netflix

Maddy and Audrey then meet up where Maddy reveals Adam gave the secret files on Audrey's family. She goes onto explain Angelis (the head of MI6) has secret files on everyone in the government including one that has a Russian plot to install Audrey's rival Kirby as Prime Minister.

After much convincing from Maddy Audrey agrees to spare Adam from prosecution when he gives her the file.

Malik meets up with Kara (Olga Kurylenko) and Adam who tell him Angelis was blackmailing the head of the supreme court and has information on everyone he then uses as leverage.

Adam and Kara track Olamide down where he is seen digitising the files. They plan to ambush him and his colleague however Maddy the CIA and Dede also appear. During the ambush Kara uncovers a file which suggests MI6 believes Adam is Dorian the secret double agent who killed Kara's men in Baku.

Kara ends up killing Olamide after he attacks her. Kara and Maddy then watch Dede confront Adam before shooting him and killing him as Maddy runs to them.

Netflix

Angelis then lies to his team and says it is Kara who killed Adam not Dede.

Maddy calls Audrey to say they have the files and reveals Adam has been killed. Audrey then orders Maddy to give Angelis back the files rather than use them to share the truth of what Adam did.

Maddy and Kara share a glass of wine and Kara explains why Angelis believed Adam was a double agent. She found a transcript of a phone conversation before the CIA arrived which involved two SVR agents talking about a British double agent called Dorian in Baku.

Dorian killed Kara's men which provoked the city and caused it to fall to the Russians. Kara goes onto explain Adam was not Dorian as he was with her the night her men were killed.

Kara calls her associate and appears to offers her the files Maddy has in exchange for a plane trip home. However she then reveals to Maddy this is their way of being able to find out who Dorian is as he will come to their car to collect the files as he is the only one with a cover and they will be able to discover his identity.

At the committee meeting Angelis claims Adam committed an act of treason and was working with Lord Melnikov and Kara in order to influence the result of the election.

Maddy heads towards the chamber where she runs into Adam's friend Patrick (Adam James). Patrick appears to act like a caring friend and then asks for the files claiming Adam would give them to him. It's at this moment Maddy realises Patrick is Dorian.

Maddy manages to get away from Patrick and gives the files to Audrey who exposes the truth about what Angelis is doing to blackmail senior members of aristocracy and politicians.

Maddy confronts Angelis and reveals Patrick is Dorian. Determined not to let Patrick get away with murdering her friends Kara bumps into Patrick and slips a photo of her friends covered in poison into his suit pocket which rapidly kills him when he opens it.

Treason ends with the revelation Angelis has been arrested and Maddy calling Dede threatening to expose what she did. Kara plans to head back to Russia and Maddy reunites with her children.

Ok but now I need to know what happens to Maddy and the kids. A season two is needed asap please Netflix.

Treason is available on Netflix now.

The Padma Shree awardee and CEO of the country's first billion-dollar IT product company said the country lacks a culture of its own R&D and pointed out that merely having manufacturing facilities of global tech product companies like Apple will not bring ""high income jobs"" for people at large in India.

""A corporate mandate to spend one or two per cent on R&D is needed for India like the two per cent CSR (corporate social responsibility) mandate. It is a high potential investment"" Vembu stated in a brief interview with PTI.

He was in the city recently to deliver his lecture on 'Transforming the Indian Economy' organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Swadeshi Research Institute.

The government has expanded the scope of CSR to R&D but the country currently does not have any dedicated research mandate for corporates.

Asked about India's success in receiving Apple's investment to manufacture in India Vembu compared the situation with Mexico where there are factories for US companies but they don't have much value addition.

""We (India) have to know what is a long-term model for us"" he asked.

""We need those factories but we also need the R&D to 'own the technologies' because we need to have high income jobs to come here (India). Then the income will spread through the economy. Mere factories without intellectual properties will have limited benefit on the economy"" Vembu said.

Union IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw had earlier announced Apple's iPhone is now getting made in India and its biggest plant is being set up at Hosur near Bengaluru. Some 60000 people will work in a single factory.

Emphasizing building a culture of research Vembu said ""There are large multiplier effects from R&D jobs. We need these jobs here."" India must focus on design development and manufacturing for the world Vembu said.

He built his billion-dollar product company purely on research by Indians engaging rural talent and resource.

Vembu said the company will begin R&D work on India-made computer-aided design software for engineering and other sectors which are now dominated by the US or other global majors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L21vdG9yaW5nL2x1eHVyeS8yMDIzLWF1ZGktcnMzLXNwb3J0YmFjay1uZXctY2FyLXJldmlldy9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzJhM2M2NTc0ODRkMTYxOTg3M2ZiNWUxYjE2MTFkNjY40gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MuY29tLmF1L3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbW90b3JpbmcvbHV4dXJ5LzIwMjMtYXVkaS1yczMtc3BvcnRiYWNrLW5ldy1jYXItcmV2aWV3L25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvMmEzYzY1NzQ4NGQxNjE5ODczZmI1ZTFiMTYxMWQ2Njg_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The supercar rivalling hatchback,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.news.com.au/technology/motoring/luxury/2023-audi-rs3-sportback-new-car-review/news-story/2a3c657484d1619873fb5e1b1611d668 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzLmNvbS5hdS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L21vdG9yaW5nL2x1eHVyeS8yMDIzLWF1ZGktcnMzLXNwb3J0YmFjay1uZXctY2FyLXJldmlldy9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzJhM2M2NTc0ODRkMTYxOTg3M2ZiNWUxYjE2MTFkNjY40gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MuY29tLmF1L3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbW90b3JpbmcvbHV4dXJ5LzIwMjMtYXVkaS1yczMtc3BvcnRiYWNrLW5ldy1jYXItcmV2aWV3L25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvMmEzYzY1NzQ4NGQxNjE5ODczZmI1ZTFiMTYxMWQ2Njg_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9uZXdzLWNtL2wtdC1jb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb24td2lucy1wcmVzdGlnaW91cy1vcmRlci1mcm9tLXR1bWFrdXJ1LWluZHVzdHJpYWwtdG93bnNoaXAtMTIyMTIyNjAwMjM5XzEuaHRtbNIBkwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvbmV3cy1jbS9sLXQtY29uc3RydWN0aW9uLXdpbnMtcHJlc3RpZ2lvdXMtb3JkZXItZnJvbS10dW1ha3VydS1pbmR1c3RyaWFsLXRvd25zaGlwLTEyMjEyMjYwMDIzOV8xLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,L&T Construction wins prestigious order from Tumakuru Industrial Township,"Secures repeat orders from Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board

Utilities have been one of the hottest topics of 2022 as the Russian invasion of Ukraine ushered in a wave of inflation especially in Europe. In fact in the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) energy inflation stood at 28.1% on average. The bulk of this inflation was contributed by 13 countries all of which saw energy inflation soar above a painful 30%. The largest inflation was in Italy where energy prices soared by a whopping 71% annually in October.

The U.S on the other hand saw relatively 'muted' energy inflation that stood at just 17.3% in the same month. This was the third lowest among all G7 economies and the primary reason that Americans remained better off was that they do not rely on Russian energy imports. However this does not mean that prices are low as natural gas and coal shortages have nevertheless pushed up retail utility prices to five year highs especially as record natural gas prices ended up driving the cost of producing electricity. For America these price increases are unavoidable since the largest portion (35.4%) of electricity is generated via natural gas. The price volatility itself has expedited the shift to renewable energy among utilities according to the IEA.

However these prices which end up in massive profits for power producers do have a silver lining. According to Bloomberg these companies are selling excess capacity at lower prices - rates that coal and gas producers cannot match. This according to analysts can end up putting the coal companies out of business and reducing emissions in the long term. The latest in the U.S. energy and utility sector these days is Winter Storm Elliott which has disrupted oil and gas output - which in turn has led to higher prices and power blackouts all over the country. U.S. benchmark oil prices jumped to $79.56 a barrel while power prices soared to $3700 per megawatt hour. Some oil companies that suffered from the reduced output are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC).

Today we will look at which companies are the largest when it comes to providing electricity and gas to Americans. Some largest U.S. utilities are Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO).

It's tough knowing where to invest right now. The stock market has been in the doldrums all year and 2023 isn't looking much better. There are serious concerns that the Federal Reserve will push interest rates too high and cause a steep economic downturn.

But if we look past all this uncertainty we can see a few longer-term growth trends that should remain strong over the coming years. Three of the biggest megatrends are:

Decarbonization : The economy is transitioning to lower-carbon energy sources.

Digitization : Businesses are undergoing digital transformation initiatives to bring more of their business processes online.

Deglobalization : Countries are shifting their supply chains onshore to improve their resilience.

Because of that companies working to capitalize on these themes should thrive in the coming years. That's why the best place to invest $5000 (or any other amount) is across these megatrends. Here are five companies aligning their businesses to capitalize on one or more of these themes.

The data infrastructure leader

American Tower (AMT -1.01%) is one of the largest global real estate investment trusts (REITs). The company operates 222000 communications sites worldwide and over two dozen U.S. data centers.

This infrastructure is crucial for increased digitization. Growing data use from 5G streaming cloud computing and other digitization trends is driving the need for more mobile-communications infrastructure and data centers. According to one estimate companies must invest $1 trillion over the next five years to upgrade global data infrastructure.

That should enable American Tower to add more tenants to its existing towers and data centers develop new sites and continue to acquire locations. These drivers position the REIT to continue growing its cash flow and dividend at above-average rates over the next few years.

The megatrend infrastructure investor

Brookfield Infrastructure (BIPC -0.69%) (BIP 0.23%) is a global infrastructure investor with operations across the utility energy midstream transportation and data sectors. The company is increasingly focused on investments aligned with the digitization decarbonization and deglobalization trends.

Brookfield has built a leading data infrastructure portfolio with towers fiber optic networks and data centers. It's also capitalizing on deglobalization by helping semiconductor giant Intel onshore manufacturing capacity by financing the construction of two new plants in the U.S.

On top of that it's investing in several decarbonization initiatives. The company expects these themes to power organic growth at or above the top end of its 6% to 9% annual target range in the coming years. That should support 5% to 9% annual dividend growth.

Securing the digital transformation

Palo Alto Networks (PANW 0.61%) is a global leader in cybersecurity. Network security is becoming increasingly important as more companies digitize their businesses and hybrid work becomes the norm.

Meanwhile cyberthreats are growing more complex and costly. According to Cybersecurity Ventures global cybercrime costs will balloon to $10.5 trillion annually by 2025 up from $3 trillion in 2015. Palo Alto Network built a three-platform strategy to help clients secure their digital transformation. That's leading it to gain market share as customers consolidate their network security with the company's integrated platform and best-of-breed capabilities.

The logistics real estate leader

Prologis (PLD -0.61%) is the global leader in logistics real estate with 1 billion square feet of space across 19 countries. Demand for warehouse space has skyrocketed since the pandemic driven by the accelerated adoption of e-commerce and shifting inventory-management practices to improve supply chain resiliency.

These digitization and globalization drivers have the REIT expecting to grow its same-site net operating income at an 8% to 10% annual rate for the next few years as legacy leases expire and are repriced to higher market rates. In addition the company expects to develop additional warehouse capacity.

According to global commercial real estate company CBRE the U.S. will need an additional 330 million square feet of distribution space by 2025 to handle the expected growth of e-commerce sales alone.

The clean energy king

NextEra Energy (NEE -1.06%) is the world's largest producer of wind and solar energy and a global leader in battery storage. It's investing billions of dollars annually to grow its renewable energy capacity and build additional clean energy infrastructure.

These investments have the utility on pace to grow its adjusted earnings per share by as much as 10% per year through 2025. That should support around 10% annual growth in its dividend through 2024. Overall the company sees upward of $4 trillion in investment opportunities to fully decarbonize the U.S. economy over the next 30 years.

Positioned to prosper

Over the coming years companies will invest trillions of dollars in digitizing decarbonizing and deglobalizing their operations. That will benefit the companies focused on capitalizing on these megatrends like American Tower Brookfield Infrastructure Palo Alto Networks Prologis and NextEra Energy. Because of that investors could do very well by investing $5000 across those five stocks over the next five years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpc3VhbGNhcGl0YWxpc3QuY29tL2JpZ2dlc3QtcHVibGljLWNvbXBhbmllcy1pbi10aGUtd29ybGQtMjAyMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ranked: The 100 Biggest Public Companies in the World,"The Biggest Companies in the World in 2022

The World’s Largest Public Companies in 2022

Today Apple stands as the world’s most valuable company towering at a $2.3 trillion valuation.

Despite the tech downturn of 2022—driven by rising interest rates and slower sales—Apple maintained its top spot. This was largely thanks to record revenues and healthy consumer demand for iPhones which drive about half of its total revenue.

Following Apple is Microsoft. Unlike Apple Microsoft has faced slower earnings over the year due to lower demand for personal computers and the weighing impact of a strong U.S. dollar. Overall about 50% of the company’s sales take place overseas.

*As of Dec 12 2022.

Oil giant Saudi Aramco is the third largest publicly-traded company globally at $1.8 trillion. It’s also the only non-U.S. company in the top 10.

In May the state-run company briefly became the most valuable company on the planet as soaring energy prices boosted earnings. Saudia Arabia is the largest exporter of oil in the world and the country’s economy is forecast to grow 7.6% in 2022—one of the fastest globally.

Overall 62 companies of the 100 largest are headquartered in the U.S. 11 are based in China and five are located in France.

Top 10 Performance in 2022

For many of the world’s largest companies 2022 was a brutal year for performance.

As the above graphic shows the vast majority of the world’s titans saw their market values decline. Half of these companies saw double-digit drops.

Tesla has witnessed nearly 70% of its market cap being erased this year. Two main factors are behind this drop: falling demand especially in China and CEO Elon Musk’s volatile and risky acquisition of Twitter.

On the other hand UnitedHealth Group has seen the strongest performance among the top 10.

The company which rakes in a large share of its earnings from employer-backed insurance plans said that recessionary impacts had not yet begun materializing in 2022.

Biggest Companies in the World by Sector

Even with sinking market values across the sector in 2022 tech remains dominant.

Among the world’s biggest companies 20 are in tech spanning a combined market value of $9.2 trillion. For perspective that’s about 31% of the market value of the 100 largest companies.

Rank Sector Combined Market Value Number of Companies Biggest Company in Sector 1 👩‍💻 Technology $9.2T 20 Apple 2 🚗 Consumer Discretionary $4.7T 17 Amazon 3 🩺 Health Care $4.3T 17 UnitedHealth Group 4 🛢️ Energy $3.4T 8 Saudi Aramco 5 💵 Financials $3.0T 14 Berkshire Hathaway 6 🏭 Industrials $1.8T 9 Visa 7 🥫 Consumer Staples $1.8T 7 Procter & Gamble 8 📞 Telecommunications $841B 5 Cisco 9 ⛏️ Basic Materials $326B 2 Linde 10 🔌 Utilities $127B 1 Nextera Energy

Companies are classified according to the FTSE Russell Industry Classification Benchmark. *As of Dec 12 2022.

Consumer discretionary and health care sectors fall next in line with big players such as Amazon and Johnson & Johnson among their ranks.

At the other end of the spectrum is utilities the smallest sector overall at least pertaining to the largest companies list. NextEra Energy the sole utilities company among the rankings is one of the world’s largest developers of wind and solar energy. Over the next three years it plans to invest up to $95 billion in greening its power operations.

Change of Fortune

It comes as no surprise that many of the biggest companies in the world are long-established players in global markets.

Yet within the rankings some of the notable risers compared to 2021 are UnitedHealth Group which launched from #19 in 2021 to #8 this year and NVIDIA which has climbed to become the 11th largest company globally up from #24 last year.

By contrast some of the biggest losers are Meta (Facebook’s parent company) and Alibaba. Meta has fallen across the rankings to #26 in 2022 from #6 in 2021. Meanwhile Alibaba was once the ninth largest globally but has tumbled to #36. Both companies have seen considerable value wiped from their market caps—roughly 66% and 28% respectively​​—amid lagging earnings.

With the year coming to a close it remains to be seen whether the world’s biggest companies stage a comeback in 2023 or face more challenging conditions ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzI2L2dvdC0xMDAwLTUtc3RvY2tzLXRvLWJ1eS10by1zdGFydC0yMDIzLXdpdGgtYS1iYW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Got $1000? 5 Sensational Stocks to Buy to Start 2023 With a Bang,"You don't need a mountain of money to grow your wealth on Wall Street.

For many 2022 has been a disaster from an investing perspective. The ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average broad-based S&P 500 and growth-dependent Nasdaq Composite have tumbled as much as 22% 28% and 38% respectively from their all-time highs. For those of you keeping score at home it means all three indexes are or were at one point in a bear market.

However the grimmest years on Wall Street often beget opportunity for patient investors. Since every bear market throughout history has eventually been recouped (and then some) by a bull market rally the 2022 bear market represents the ideal time for long-term investors to pounce.

Here's the best part: Most online brokerages have completely done away with commissions and minimum deposit requirements. This means any amount of money -- even $1000 -- can be the perfect sum to put to work right now.

If you have $1000 that won't be needed for emergencies or to cover bills putting it to work in the following five sensational stocks can help you start 2023 with a bang.

Novavax

The first game-changing stock to buy to begin 2023 with a bang is one of the worst-performing healthcare stocks of 2022: Novavax (NVAX 98.66%). Multiple filing delays seeking Emergency Use Authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine production delays and a recent share offering and convertible debt issuance all haven't set well with investors. But with its market cap now below $900 million there is plenty of reward with a reasonably low amount of risk.

Although we seem to have moved past the worst of the pandemic initial series vaccines in emerging markets and booster shots in developed markets still represent a multibillion-dollar opportunity for Novavax and a handful of other vaccine developers.

NVX-CoV2373 (known as Nuvaxovid outside the U.S.) is one of only three COVID vaccines to reach the 90% vaccine efficacy (VE) level in clinical trials. What's more it's a protein-based vaccine that relies on older technology to help a person's immune system recognize and fight the infection. This VE and differentiation should allow NVX-CoV2373 to remain a key player for years.

But the Novavax growth story is more about what's to come. With its drug-development platform now proven the company is working on Omicron-specific coronavirus vaccines combination vaccines targeting influenza and COVID and a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine. Expanding its product lineup and moving past near-term clinical trial expenses should result in revenue stabilization and a push toward recurring profitability.

If you need one more reason to trust in Novavax consider that it ended September with $1.28 billion in cash and cash equivalents before its recent capital-raising endeavors. It's a financially sound company.

NextEra Energy

Another incredible stock you can buy with $1000 to start 2023 on the right foot is electric utility NextEra Energy (NEE -1.06%).

Defensive stocks are a really smart way to hedge against the growing likelihood of a recession or at the very least near-term instability in the economy and stock market. Since homeowners and renters don't change their electricity consumption habits from one year to the next a major utility like NextEra can be counted on to deliver highly predictable cash flow every year.

But what really allows this company to stand out is its hefty investment in a green future. There isn't a utility that's generating more capacity from solar or wind power than NextEra Energy. While the cost to invest in these projects has been sizable the company was able to lean on historically low interest rates for over a decade as well as its operating cash flow to make it happen.

The end result is lower electricity-generation costs and a compound annual growth rate of 8.4% over the past 15 years. That might not sound impressive but the typical electric utility grows by a low single-digit percentage.

NextEra Energy is doing right by its shareholders too. Aside from the fact that its shares have delivered a positive total return in 19 out of the past 20 years management is looking to boost the company's dividend by around 10% annually through 2024.

AstraZeneca

To further beat the drum on defensive stocks pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca (AZN -0.55%) makes for a sensational stock to buy with $1000 to start 2023 off right.

From a macro perspective people will still get sick -- however the global economy performs -- and will require prescription drugs medical devices and healthcare services. This provides a base level of demand for drug developers like AstraZeneca.

On a company-specific basis two of AstraZeneca's core businesses are firing on all cylinders. Excluding currency movements the company's oncology and cardiovascular drug segments have increased sales by 20% and 18% respectively through the first nine months of 2022.

The oncology segment has four drugs in blockbuster territory (over $1 billion in annual sales) with double-digit year-over-year sales growth.

And next-generation type 2 diabetes drug Farxiga has cleaned up with 58% constant-currency sales growth ($3.2 billion in total sales) through nine months.

AstraZeneca's acquisition of rare-disease drugmaker Alexion Pharmaceuticals last year is also paying dividends. Rare-disease therapeutics often have little competition and rarely face any list-price pushback from health insurers. Thanks to Alexion developing a next-gen treatment to its blockbuster drug Soliris AstraZeneca can protect more than $4 billion in rare-disease drug sales from generic competition for a long time to come.

Innovative Industrial Properties

A fourth awe-inspiring stock you can put $1000 in right now to kick off 2023 with a bang is cannabis-focused real estate investment trust (REIT) Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR -0.36%) or IIP for short. IIP has a nearly 7% dividend yield!

Like pretty much all REITs IIP's goal is to acquire assets that it can rent out for long periods. In this instance it's acquiring medical marijuana cultivation and processing facilities in pot-legalized states. Since cannabis is a nondiscretionary good -- i.e. people continue to buy it even if the U.S. economy weakens or inflation picks up -- IIP can count on strong demand for its facilities.

One of the more interesting benefits for Innovative Industrial Properties is that the lack of cannabis reform on Capitol Hill is helping the company. As long as marijuana remains illicit at the federal level access to basic financial services for multi-state operators (MSOs) will be sparse. IIP uses its sale-leaseback program to acquire properties from cash-needy MSOs then leases these properties back to the seller. It's an easy way for the company to land long-term tenants.

It should also be noted that Innovative Industrial Properties' portfolio of 111 properties have triple-net leases. These put the onus of all costs on the renter including maintenance utilities insurance and even property taxes. Although this usually leads to lower rental rates it removes surprise costs from the equation for IIP.

Broadcom

The fifth and final sensational stock to buy with $1000 to start 2023 off with a bang is semiconductor giant Broadcom (AVGO 2.08%) which just wrapped up its fiscal 2022 delivering 21% revenue growth to $33.2 billion.

Whereas most chipmakers have been clobbered by demand concerns or supply chain constraints Broadcom has been successfully chugging along. The company should be a key beneficiary of 5G wireless upgrades. This first major improvement to wireless download speeds in about a decade will lead to a persistent device-replacement cycle through at least mid-decade. Broadcom brings in the bulk of its sales from wireless chips and accessories found in next-generation smartphones.

Then again there's plenty of opportunity for Broadcom to thrive as technology takes hold in other parts of our everyday lives. For instance it could see sustained double-digit sales growth from its automotive solutions segment. Likewise demand for access and connectivity chips in data center servers should remain strong with businesses accelerating their push online and into the cloud in the wake of the pandemic.

Don't forget about Broadcom's backlog either. Even though CEO Hock Tan wouldn't discuss the company's backlog during his latest quarterly conference call the company entered its 2022 with a record $14.9 billion in orders. Even if the U.S. and global economies weaken operating cash flow is buffered by its backlog.

The cherry on top is that Broadcom has grown its quarterly dividend by 6471% -- from $0.07 to $4.60 -- over the past 12 years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbWVyY29taW5kaWEuY29tL3RvcC1kZXZlbG9wbWVudHMtdGhhdC1lbGVjdHJpYy12ZWhpY2xlLWluZHVzdHJ5LWluLTIwMjLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top Developments That Shaped the Electric Vehicle Industry in 2022,"The rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and their increasing popularity indicate they are no longer a short-term trend but a viable alternative to internal combustion automobiles.

EV sales stood at 257278 units in the third quarter (Q3) of the calendar year 2022. This represents a 183% year-over-year (YoY) growth compared to the 90831 units sold in the same period last year. The numbers were revealed in the data released by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways through its Vahan Dashboard.

As of December 8 2022 India had more than 1.8 million registered electric vehicles (EVs) with Uttar Pradesh accounting for nearly 23% of the total at 0.41 million Nitin Gadkari Minister of Road Transport and Highways said in the Lok Sabha.

More than half of the total EVs in the country are three-wheelers used for commercial transport followed by 800000 two-wheelers meant for personal use. At present the country has roughly 5151 operational EV charging stations.

Both Centre and state governments have issued enabling policies for the widespread adoption of EVs to align with emission goals in 2050.

Central government policies

In January the Ministry of Power (MoP) issued revised guidelines for EV charging infrastructure. These guidelines helped set the timelines for providing grid connectivity for installing public charging stations.

Further the guidelines aim to enable faster adoption of EVs in India by ensuring safe reliable accessible and affordable charging infrastructure and ecosystem. Another objective is to provide affordable tariffs for charging station operators/owners and EV owners and proactively support the creation of EV charging infrastructure.

In March the Ministry of Heavy Industries approved 2877 EV charging stations in 68 cities across 25 states and union territories under the second phase of the faster adoption and manufacturing of hybrid and electric vehicles (FAME-II) program.

FAME-II was initially intended for three years ending March 31 2022. The program was extended in 2021 by 24 months until March 31 2024. FAME India is part of the National Electricity Mobility Mission Plan which was launched to push for early adoption and market creation for both hybrids and EVs.

In April NITI Aayog issued the draft battery-swapping policy addressing the key technical regulatory institutional and financing challenges to help India develop battery-swapping ecosystems to unlock the large-scale adoption of battery-swapping."

The Memphis Grizzles all-star point guard Morant is the fifth active player with a Nike signature sneaker and the 23rd player in NBA history.

In a press release Sunday from Nike basketball the brand introduced Morant as the first Gen Z signature athlete. He will wear the sneaker in the Christmas Day game against the Golden State Warriors.

From the release date Morant's first comments and the goal of the sneaker here is everything you need to know about Morant's shoe.

The Ja 1 is expected to release globally in April of 2023.

Morant and the Nike design team had been working more than two years on the sneaker and marketing plans around it. Morant's logo features the letters JA above a chevron. Nike said it is a ""nod to the verticality speed and sharpness of Morant's game.""

Nike will release more details and plans for Morant's signature sneaker closer to the release date.

Inside the sneaker

Morant often wears Kobe Bryant and Kevin Durant sneakers during games and you can see similar features of both in his first sneaker. The Ja 1 has a similar low-cut model but the performative goals mimic those that you would expect of a sneaker from Morant. He wanted the shoe to support his ability to cut jump dunk and perform crossovers.

“It’s constructed to keep players in control maximize hang time and reduce landing force through lockdown benefits"" Nike said.

Ja Morant's mindset is sprinkled into the shoe

Morant's shoe will represent his road traveled to this point of his NBA career. He has the words ""beneath no one"" tattooed on his left arm. That's a part of the mentality and grind Morant wants others to feel when wearing the Ja 1.

That grind included doing 800 box jumps on a tractor tire every day while imagining being in the NBA. The mentality of the shoe is aimed to reflect that.

Both Gil and I see the same challenges ahead as to where intermodal rail can and will grow. Whether you are in California or North Carolina how do you see the critical choices ahead? Care to share your views?

Here is the direct internet URL link to Gil’s complete reporting and options selection choices: https://www.railwayage.com/news/why-intermodal-isnt-everything-its-cracked-up-to-be/

I begin by reviewing the strategic challenges as an entrepreneur like Gil Lamphere sees them. Gil laid out the financial logic behind the investment risks associated with the railroad industry’s business model for the intermodal sector. He reminded us of how challenging it is for rail carriers to make continuous high-margin returns from hauling trailers and containers on railway cars.

Gil spent years trying to answer the simple question of how profitable intermodal rail was or was not. He was looking to define the complex spreadsheet calculation of just the intermodal sector operating income as a percent of costs. The lower the OR (operating ratio) number the higher the commercial profitability. Put another way expensing only 55% of a railroad’s operating budget to earn a 45% revenue margin is better than having expenses at about 70% with a revenue margin of just 30%.

Gil’s point is this: Given the private railway investment model the standalone intermodal financial feasibility must be measured if intermodal is to continue to attract railway investment. Diverting highway market share and obtaining annual high-volume growth rates are insufficient to define intermodal success if you are in that as a trade business.

I concur. It is a challenge.

Class I railroad prefer to have a business with a constant non-variable flow of goods to make their intermodal operations work profitably. As a business-focused railroader Gil concluded that strategic planning for the intermodal commerce segment has to focus mostly upon the prices and expenses of the enterprise’s income statement. Those changes plus the return on the invested balance sheet assets are the most critical measurements at least to those requiring private investment to drive the business expansion. Focusing upon increasing tons or ton-miles of work performed is less important.

Gil’s Financial Score Card:

This may best represent Gil’s executive summary:

Intermodal is largely a myth under the railroads’ current physical configurations.

Intermodal offers limited and barely adequate service.

Intermodal is an incremental cash flow producer but is challenging when it has to cover a fully allocated cost burden.

Gil’s message is important for all parties including states and shippers to comprehend if you are expecting to collaborate with rail companies on joint-venture intermodal projects.

Here are Gil’s five possible paths going forward to test the intermodal market as I define them. Each option has different associated inputs and risks.

Strategy No. 1: Build It Out wherein the railroads add new track and terminals taking on the market risk by building around specific customer contract terms operating perhaps as many as eight up-to-200-car long daily trains. This strategy uses the shipper-contract promised revenues to leverage a separately financed intermodal subsidiary and price to recover a ROE (return on equity) of ~13% to maybe 20% with a 65% OR.

Strategy No. 2: Selected Hub and Short Shuttle what I rename as a Fixed-Schedule Shuttle “horizontal elevator” type service. Each intermodal train departs and arrives at a precise time throughout the day. It is a railroad carrier hook-and-haul/drop-and-pickup return service—something we at Zeta Tech Associates proposed for others like the The Port of New York and New Jersey and an Israeli Railroad-served inland port operation. The logical distance move might be about 350 to 500 miles but the real market opportunity is in 150 to maybe 250 miles.

Strategy No. 3: Restructured for a Low-Cost Center a “selected short line lanes” service as in Georgia or the mixed CSX train connecting Wilmington to Charlotte N.C. Sort of a niche market.

Strategy No. 4: Mixed Intermodal/ Merchandise/Transloading. This is built around intermodal and blended transload carload freight commodities that share a common O/D lane with mixed cargo types at the same key ports. This leverages higher profit returns for coastal and inland port market pairs that have blends of container and either general cargo freight or selected premium bulk agricultural exports.

Strategy No. 5: All-in P&G-Like Model. This approach might work if railroad management has the investor backing to risk a presumed “Proctor & Gamble” optimistic marketing strategy. That classic entrepreneurial thinking assumes that as volume grows and more and more trucks are shifted to rail the result has got to be an improving profit margin. It might work but it’s a bit risky not fully proven.

Wait: There is a sixth choice: Do Nothing Strategy. Many economists define this as the classic “milk-it” strategy. Invest very little added capital be satisfied with a probable 10% to 12% rate of return and a PSR-like free cash flow profit at an OR between 55 and 65 characterized by the absence of any significant market share gains. This model has a high probability of becoming an eventual exit strategy.

Failures Among Some Successes

Yes there clearly are challenges. But let’s acknowledge that when using confidential railway costing models some of us have identified clear high volume density corridors where intermodal trains do already operate profitably and where additional margin might be achieved by modifying the business model used. Those opportunities have to be balanced against certain risks.

For a balanced scorecard let’s acknowledge that not every intermodal project tested has succeeded. There are failures. Several Class I’s have exited markets toward which they used to be opportunistic. For example Norfolk Southern and others tried a West Virginia intermodal project and it never caught on with customers. The reasons are not fully understood but possibly it was due to an overestimation of the regional market demand. The terminal was sold off last year in an auction.

My takeaway message: Anyone planning a new intermodal terminal or route service should assume that private ventures come with an unspoken but possible failure rate. The lesson learned is that each new project must have its own due diligence review. How much risk is hard to exactly predict but case history reviews suggest that about one-third may not achieve their strategic business targets.

Still failure is part of the natural cleansing when you employ private initiatives. Closing some down and selling the parts off is a natural part of testing new markets.

Some Unexpected Successes

About a decade ago a large all-new hub-and-spoke CSX terminal built at New Baltimore Ohio (south of Toledo) didn’t pan out as expected. But that business outcome had an unexpected upside. What might be characterized as a CSX intermodal stumble became perhaps a BNSF win. BNSF negotiated a deal whereby today this CSX Ohio location looks like a forward BNSF Logistics Park far to the east of BNSF’s normal Chicago operating territory. Under a freely negotiated arrangement CSX earns revenue by hauling BNSF intermodal trains between the Chicago terminal and northwestern Ohio under a special haulage agreement. So in October 2018 BNSF extended its direct West Coast intermodal service east as far as western Ohio. It’s five days a week. two trains per day in each direction. CSX also earns a rental use income from the “sunk cost” intermodal yard it built. Who saw that outcome back around 2012?

BNSF corporate marketing map

I’m not sure that this business outcome fits neatly into the five strategies outlined by Gil. Let’s call it a hybrid operation. Very few of us old hands projected this positive outcome:

This boils down to opportunities for one company to have an operation of its private train over another carrier’s tracks with both parties earning commercial compensation. This type of business model might be used going forward on other routes.

The Raider most closely resembles its stealthy predecessor the B-2 Spirit and both were built by defense giant Northrop Grumman. With only head-on views of the B-21 released and available to the press it is hard to know all the features that distinguish it from its predecessor. Still the head-on image is enough to identify some major changes.

The Raider is a stealth flying wing designed to carry an explosive arsenal deep into hostile countries while bypassing their radar systems. The B-2 could deliver deadly payloads from conventional explosives to nuclear weapons. Unlike the Spirit’s 1988 reveal the B-21 arrived in a world with a very different geopolitical climate one where the nuclear superpower over the horizon for the US to worry about is China not the Soviet Union.

The “Spirit” of the Cold War

The Spirit’s production which the Air Force originally expected to reach 132 bombers was stopped after just 21. This change matched the geopolitical and domestic expectations of the mid-1990s when the dissolution of the USSR and the seemingly unchecked ascendancy of American power meant specialized aircraft to bypass advanced defenses seemed superfluous at best.

Stealth is a curious kind of protective technology. It is built into the physical form of the aircraft with rounded shapes and smooth edges built to minimize the amount of surface that reflects radio waves back to radar receivers. That makes the shape both tremendously important as a secret during development even if the ultimate form will be discernible by eyes and cameras. A 1988 memo from the CIA declassified decades later estimated that half of what the Soviet Union knew about stealth came from the public reporting on it by one Aviation Week writer in the United States.

[Related: Our first look at the Air Force’s new B-21 stealth bomber was just a careful teaser]

That was before Aviation Week pulled its biggest stunt to report on stealth aircraft. In 1988 for the B-2 rollout the bomber was pulled by a tractor from a hangar into the open air and then wheeled back again. Reporters with Aviation Week knowing the location and time of the rollout rented a Cessna plane to get photographs from overhead.

“One of the driving functions to get us into this mode was ‘Hey if they were going to pull this thing out of the hangar into the open I can guarantee the Russians are going to have a satellite overhead. And if the powers that be don’t care if the Russians see the trailing edge why should they care about the American people?’” William B. Scott former Aviation Week editor recalled in a recent piece.

While the Air Force and pre-merger Northrop revealed more about the B-2 over time the stunt by Aviation Week to capture photographs of the plane’s whole outline and trailing edges was clearly remembered. The 1988 reveal took place outside a hangar and during the daytime. The 2022 reveal of the B-21 took place at night and it barely left the hangar.

Spot these differences

Even limited to the head-on view there’s still striking details that stand out in the new bomber compared to the old one. The B-2 Spirit appears as two caverns and a mound arising from the flat plain of the wing. The B-21 instead shares one generally rising approach to the middle with a gentle slope for the narrower air inlets before a sharper incline to the peak of the cockpit.

“Perhaps the most striking features of the B-21 are its slender barely-there air intakes. Unlike the higher-rise scalloped intakes on the B-2 the B-21’s are almost organically a part of its wing root” reports Air & Space Forces Magazine. “That’s good for stealth—radar loves abrupt angles and big cavities—but the intakes are so thin and shallow they seem hardly big enough to swallow enough air to feed the B-21’s engines.”

The fact that it has slender inlets means that there would be less of a cavity for search radars to find. Moreover the B-21’s engine fan blades are a huge radar reflector that are shielded from direct view.

There are seven other notable differences spotted by Air & Space Forces from depth of the bomber’s belly to its landing gear color and smoothness. Sensor technology has improved greatly in the decades since the first B-2 was introduced to the world and protecting the bomber means stealth not just against radar but from acoustic sensors thermal imaging and other detection strategies.

Many tests and invariably reveals are still ahead for the Raider which has come a long way since the plane was first developed as the Long Range Strike Bomber. The Air Force also intends to roll the B-21 into full production eventually replacing not just the existing B-2 Spirits but the B-1 Lancer bombers. It may even one day replace the still-in-service B-52 bomber though that’s a lower priority for the Air Force.

The new B-21 Raider was unveiled at Northrop Grumman's factory in California on December 2. [US Air Force]

The US Air Force maintains the most capable fleet of strategic bombers in the world empowering the US military to deliver rapid lethal force to adverse situations and to help allies in need.

The Air Force's bomber fleet -- now made up of B-1B Lancers B-2 Spirits and B-52 Stratofortresses -- will look very different in the coming years following the unveiling of the new B-21 Raider which is expected to start service in 2027.

The B-1B Lancer is the backbone of the United States' long-range bomber force and can carry the largest conventional payload of both guided and unguided weapons in the Air Force inventory. There are over 60 currently estimated in service.

The B-2 Spirit is a stealth bomber designed to penetrate dense anti-aircraft defences and capable of delivering both conventional and nuclear munitions. There are an estimated 20 currently in service.

The B-52 Stratofortress is a long-range heavy bomber that can perform a variety of missions including strategic attack close-air support air interdiction and offensive counter-air and maritime operations. There are over 70 currently estimated in service.

The Stratofortress is expected to be in service through 2050 and the Air Force has several upgrades planned including new engines a new radar and a new nuclear weapon.

Although some of these older bombers will continue to be in service and receive upgrades others will retire in the coming years as the B-21 Raider comes online.

Unveiled in early December the B-21 Raider is expected to serve within a larger family of systems for conventional long-range strike including intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance; electronic attack; communication; and other capabilities. It is nuclear capable and designed to accommodate manned or unmanned operations.

""As the United States continues to innovate this bomber will be able to defend our country with new weapons that haven't even been invented yet"" US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin said December 2.

""And the B-21 is multi-functional. It can handle anything from gathering intel to battle management to integrating with our allies and partners. And it will work seamlessly across domains and theaters and across the joint force"" he said.

The Air Force expects to acquire at least 100 B-21s.

Types of weaponry on US bombers

US strategic bombers are able to carry a variety of nuclear and non-nuclear precision guided munitions such as the AGM-86 Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) and the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM).

The ALCM is a cruise missile that aims to dilute an enemy's forces and complicate defence of its territory. An enemy force would have to counterattack each of the missiles making defence against them costly and complicated according to the Air Force.

""The enemy's defences are further hampered by the missiles' smallness and low-altitude flight capability which make them difficult to detect on radar"" it said.

The JDAM is a guidance tail kit that converts existing unguided free-fall bombs into accurate adverse weather ""smart"" munitions. JDAM enables multiple weapons to be directed against single or multiple targets on a single pass.

The JASSM is a low observable standoff air-launched cruise missile with a range of 370km while the JASSM Extended Range (JASSM-ER) has a range of approximately 1000km.

Equipped with 432kg warheads the JASSM and JASSM-ER feature identical low observable airframes designed to evade enemy air defence.

The missiles are also equipped with an inertial navigation system/global positioning system (INS/GPS) unit developed for the Joint Direct Attack Munition and Joint Standoff Weapon bombs an infrared seeker for terminal guidance and a variety of special packages like electronic jamming.

The JASSM-ER when equipped with a weapon data link can correct course after launch enabling it to hit moving targets on land or at sea.

Deliveries to the Air Force of another variant of the missile the JASSM-XR (Extreme Range) with a range of approximately 1800km are expected to begin in January 2024.

Each Stratofortress can carry up to 12 JASSMs on its wing pylons and another eight inside its bomb bay.

With 20 B-52Hs the US Air Force could deliver some 400 JASSM-ERs against targets from a maximum stand-off distance of 1000km.

Recent missions

In 2022 US strategic bombers repeatedly reaffirmed Washington's commitment to its allies.

US Central Command (CENTCOM) conducted the latest of what is known as a Bomber Task Force (BTF) mission on November 10.

During the mission two B-52H Stratofortresses flew from the US state of Louisiana to the CENTCOM region that includes the Middle East and Central Asia and co-ordinated with 13 partner nation air forces along the way.

One such co-ordination was with Israel. Israeli Air Force F-35 Adir fighter jets escorted the bombers above Israeli airspace on their way back from the Arabian Gulf.

The type of high-level co-ordination during the mission showcased ""the ability to rapidly deploy global airpower alongside coalition and regional partner forces and ensuring the security of this critical region"" CENTCOM said.

In February March and June US bombers conducted three ""presence patrols"" in the Middle East.

In the June patrol two US Air Force B-52 Stratofortresses two KC-10 Extenders and three KC-135 Stratotankers flew over the Eastern Mediterranean Arabian Peninsula and Red Sea linking up in some places with regional and international coalition partners military officials said.",,,

Good things happened in 2022 certainly but there were a fair number of bad occurrences and even some ugly ones (melting adapters on top-end GPUs springs to mind in that category). Without further ado let’s get cracking on summarizing Nvidia’s progress – or lack of it in some cases – during 2022.

Lovelace GPUs arrived with a superfast flagship – and some serious problems

Nvidia’s Lovelace GPUs succeeded Ampere with the first next-gen model coming out in mid-October the flagship RTX 4090. That was followed by the RTX 4080 a month later and while both desktop graphics cards were undeniably fast – particularly that flagship – they were both equally undeniably dogged with some thorny problems.

Let’s start with the RTX 4090 and the case of the melting adapters. Even before the RTX 4090 came out we knew it would be a powerful but power-hungry beast and so it came to pass with the flagship sporting a TGP of 450W. So any buyers had to take care that their power supply could handle that and that their case design could cope with the heat produced by the RTX 4090 (and that the GPU would fit inside the case in the first place of course).

However not long after the RTX 4090 emerged worrying reports of melting adapter cables reached our ears. These were few in number to start with and Nvidia was quick to say it was investigating but gradually these complaints multiplied.

The problem was being encountered by those who used the adapter supplied with the RTX 4090 so it could be connected to an ATX 2.0 power supply. (Those PSUs are what most PC owners have with not many folks having upgraded to the very new ATX 3.0 models. But the 4090 comes with a 16-pin power connector that works directly with ATX 3.0 PSUs and doesn’t fit ATX 2.0 models – so with the latter the adapter has to be used).

Unfortunately that adapter was melting in some cases and damaging the graphics card too in some of those instances. Which is obviously a terrible situation (not to mention the fire risk element if you’re not around when the smoking begins).

Now we should note very clearly that according to the Nvidia investigation as of mid-November there were only 50 cases globally. That’s 50 cards in purported sales of something like 125000 boards which if correct would mean the chance of a melting adapter is very unlikely. As the big Reddit mega-thread on this issue points out the chance of a melt being experienced is 0.04% – but still it can happen.

There was lots of theorizing about why the adapters were melting and the most prominent theory – that the adapter wasn’t seated properly in its socket in the GPU – was confirmed by Nvidia to be the most likely culprit. As Nvidia told us: “Our findings to date suggest that a common issue is that connectors are not fully plugged into the graphics card.”

Part of the problem here though  is that to fit this gargantuan graphics card in your PC you have to bend the power cable round quite tightly (maybe with it pressed up against the side panel of the case) and this could put strain on the adapter and perhaps begin to pull it out of the socket slightly.

What’ll be Nvidia’s final conclusion on this affair? We still don’t know that at the time of writing but this has left a somewhat sour taste in the mouths of some buyers who paid a lot of money – a small fortune in fact – for the Lovelace flagship.

However we should make it clear that the RTX 4090 itself is a jaw-droppingly speedy high-end GPU and an incredible performance high point make no mistake on that (for gamers and creatives alike). But a design flaw like this no matter how very uncommon it might be is really quite a serious drop of the ball from Nvidia (even if the company is offering expedited returns for affected graphics cards as you might expect). No matter how great the RTX 4090 might be in raw performance terms this episode has still tarnished Nvidia’s reputation to an extent.

(Image credit: Future)

Let’s move on to the RTX 4080 which may not have suffered from melting controversies but actually caused more of a stir than the RTX 4090 in the end – thanks to pricing and the fact that it turned up as two variants one of which was quickly canceled.

When Nvidia revealed the RTX 4080 two models were shown off – one with 16GB of VRAM and the other with 12GB (and a lesser spec GPU chip). Immediately there was an outcry about the latter lower-tier model and how relatively pants it was – for its price – and the undoubted confusion caused by having two such very different flavors of RTX 4080. Especially when one of those flavors looked suspiciously like an RTX 4070 in RTX 4080 clothing (with that theory very much underlined by RTX 4070 Ti rumors later in the year).

Following all this controversy Nvidia famously ‘unlaunched’ the graphics card and consigned it to the dustbin. (That said its resurrection is rumored to be imminent as the aforementioned RTX 4070 Ti but that story will be for next year).

Price-wise like the scrapped lower-tier model the RTX 4080 16GB that went on sale was still a price/performance nightmare. Particularly when custom third-party boards pushed up the already exorbitant MSRP ($1199 in the US) to dizzying heights that made them almost as costly as the RTX 4090 – which is very much a faster GPU.

So why on earth would you buy the RTX 4080 and not the flagship? That was the thinking of quite a few folks and the value proposition of the RTX 4080 prompted us to call it the GPU that Nvidia should have canceled (referencing the aforementioned canned 4080 12GB of course).

And going by sales estimates floating around via the rumor mill – with some pretty consistent approximations – it seems GPU buyers agreed and RTX 4080 sales flagged trailing the RTX 4090 by a long long way.

All in all the Lovelace graphics card launches for 2022 were seriously problematic in some respects then. But this shouldn’t draw away from the fact that the RTX 4090 offered an astonishing level of frame rate shifting power – plus don’t forget DLSS 3 was added into the mix with all Lovelace cards too (we’ll talk more about that later) – and even the RTX 4080 is a powerful GPU make no mistake.

It’s just that the price of the RTX 4080 is way more off base than the Lovelace flagship value-wise – which is really saying something – although Nvidia may well be about to correct that pricing according to the rumor mill. (Particularly in light of how that value proposition looks even worse compared to the freshly launched AMD RX 7900 XTX). Indeed by the time you read this maybe that RTX 4080 price correction could’ve already happened…

As a final note on Lovelace another blow to Nvidia was delivered by EVGA one of its larger graphics card manufacturing partners which announced just before the launch of RTX 4000 GPUs that it wouldn’t be making or selling these products (amidst controversial rumors – such as “disrespectful treatment” – about why). Effectively that wound up EVGA’s operations on the graphics card front although the firm still supports RTX 3000 boards of which some are still on sale – which brings us onto our next point…

RTX 3000 stock still hanging around

Another issue that Nvidia faced late in 2022 was the amount of RTX 3000 graphics cards that were still on shelves or in warehouses with the RTX 4000 launch looming. That represented a problem because once Lovelace GPUs were released (or even revealed) it’d mean gamers were looking to buy (or wait for) those next-gen graphics cards – and Nvidia or more precisely its partners still had all that RTX 3000 stock to shift and that’d be interfered with.

So this meant Nvidia employed a strategy in which RTX 3000 GPUs were ‘layered on top’ of next-gen GPUs as the company put it. In practice this meant we got the new RTX 4090 and 4080 the weighty high-end offerings we’ve just been discussing whereas the rest of the market remained Ampere (RTX 3070 3060 3050 – and the older budget offerings below that).

In short this meant all we got from Lovelace was super-expensive GPUs allowing breathing room for that whole range of RTX 3000 stock below to sell through. And while throughout 2022 and particularly as the year rolled on graphics card pricing had been dropping – well normalizing from inflated levels and finally dropping just below MSRP eventually – that trend stopped dead in November with Nvidia cards. Sadly RTX 3000 pricing actually rose during that month for many GeForce models as our sister site Tom’s Hardware which tracks GPU price tags on a monthly basis observed with chunky price rises (urgh) on the Nvidia front for the RTX 3090 3080 and 3070.

Perhaps because people realized they weren’t getting an RTX 4060 anytime soon at least not going by the grapevine – and leakage being thin on the ground – so mid-range options or certainly mid-to-lower range are pretty much to look at Ampere for the foreseeable.

This is what Nvidia wanted obviously enough – to be able to clear that stock – but a pair of exorbitantly priced next-gen cards and rising price tags on Ampere GPUs when previously the RTX 3000 series had been dropping in cost significantly is very much not what gamers wanted. And the way this is working as intended we presume is likely another reason as to why we shouldn’t expect an RTX 4060 any time in the near or even medium-term future.

Budget GPU woes (again)

2022 was another year in which Nvidia neglected the budget end of the GPU market which is an ongoing theme in the contemporary world of graphics cards it seems.

Last year we bemoaned the lack of an RTX 3050 at the more wallet-friendly end of the spectrum and this year we finally got this graphics card. Shame then that it turned out to be well not exactly a budget card with an MSRP of $249 in the US – which might sound okay but it’s a good chunk more than xx50 model GPUs that went before it – and you couldn’t buy the RTX 3050 at that price anyway. It’s still a fair chunk above that recommended price at the time of writing and it was not far off double upon launch early in the year (and thin on the ground stock-wise).

Nvidia also deployed the GTX 1630 in June a model actually targeted squarely at the budget arena but it was so weak sauce (plus it was well overpriced at launch and still pricey today for what it is) that the less said about this GPU the better.

Those new offerings for 2022 were not a solution then and to heap more misery on the situation Nvidia could be in the process of making things worse on the cheap GPU front. If the rumor mill is right – and there’s been some fairly consistent chatter on this – the RTX 2060 is being discontinued and the same might be the case for the GTX 1660. While we must take word from the grapevine with a great deal of seasoning if true this would leave Nvidia’s line-up at the very cheapest end of the market looking extremely thin. And things are already shaky as it is as mentioned.

Okay so don’t get us wrong the budget situation throughout 2022 particularly later on was better than last year. Mainly because 2021 was an absolute farce really with gamers paying seriously silly money for the likes of a GTX 1650 Super at the budget end of the spectrum. But still even with GPU pricing normalizing to more reasonable levels (finally) and the RTX 3050 being added to Nvidia’s roster Team Green simply didn’t do enough here and budget buyers remained restricted in choice to put it mildly.

Plus don’t forget that as we’ve already touched on the RTX 4060 looks to be a long way off still although how ‘wallet-friendly’ this GPU might be is entirely debatable anyway (the RTX 4050 isn’t in sight either for that matter; laptop GPUs aside). Apparently what we’ve got for now in the somewhat-more-affordable-department is a refreshed RTX 3060 Ti (with faster VRAM) which was brought into play late in the year – and that’s not nearly enough. (Plus it’s another sign not to expect the RTX 4060 anytime soon arguably).

Ah well. Maybe next year will be different for budget desktop GPUs. Here’s hoping.

More frame rate boosting with DLSS 3

Nvidia DLSS the company’s well-established upscaling tech got a third-gen incarnation this year which was revealed in September. DLSS 3 recruited a bunch of new features (Optical Multi Frame Generation Optical Flow Accelerator; read up more here) to further accelerate frame rates and ensure a smoother gaming experience.

There’s been some controversy around DLSS 3 and its exact use cases along with concerns about increased latency as Techspot reported which can impact certain games like twitch shooters as opposed to say Microsoft Flight Simulator. But where it works well – with supported games and Flight Simulator is very much a highlight here – it’s a great new tech and another step up in terms of getting a seriously smooth frame rate.

The obvious caveats though are that support is thin on the ground thus far and only RTX 4000 graphics cards need apply. Which makes DLSS 3 feel a bit like a tool that’s being used to help improve the value proposition of the super-pricey Lovelace GPUs which are out there the cynical might suggest – although Nvidia has told us there are reasons for the tech being RTX 4000-only. (Namely that it’ll require additional research and engineering to be applied to older Nvidia GPUs and any benefits wouldn’t be as pronounced).

Remixing old games with ray tracing

You know the saying: in with the old and… wait a minute that’s not right. But this was one of the bright ideas Nvidia had on the ray tracing front this year with RTX Remix. This new tech (built on the Nvidia Omniverse platform) was revealed at GTC 2022 alongside Lovelace graphics cards and it truly is a modder’s dream allowing for old games to easily be given a fresh coat of RTX paint with ray tracing and DLSS.

Nvidia showed off Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind in its remastered glory at GTC which looked very impressive indeed. The theory is that when it’s released next year RTX Remix will allow the modding community to spruce up a whole bunch of older games giving them a new lease of life. An exciting prospect indeed.

GeForce Now kept streaming ahead

If you couldn’t afford a new GPU then maybe you signed up for Nvidia’s game streaming service in 2022. Those who did benefited from some solid improvements to GeForce Now one of which was the ability to stream in 4K for those on Windows PCs and Macs. That was for those gamers on the higher-tier RTX 3080 membership and there was another useful change with that plan – namely the ability to sign up for just a month allowing folks to try it out for a short time and see how smoothly the fastest GeForce Now offering runs for them.

Nvidia is building a more attractive streaming option slowly but surely and the demise of Google Stadia this year (well it officially closes down mid-January 2023) has helped make more breathing space in the game streaming arena something Team Green has been trying to take advantage of naturally.

Nvidia said farewell to ARM

Nvidia’s attempted acquisition of ARM a huge $40 billion move was dogged with problems from the outset. Initiated way back in 2020 the buyout ran into nothing but trouble throughout 2021 culminating in a lawsuit from the FTC to stop the deal proceeding on the grounds that it was anti-competitive. This year in February Nvidia finally gave up this ambition and officially terminated its bid for ARM. In the end given all the opposition and the vehemence of those naysayers this was hardly a surprise.

Concluding thoughts

As you made your way through this article you may have found yourself feeling a bit depressed. A lot of what we’ve discussed here is Nvidia’s woes and missteps and that’s inevitable because well 2022 contained a fair few of them. Most obviously sky-high pricing for new GPUs issues around both the RTX 4090 (adapters melting) and RTX 4080 (that canceled version plus value proposition) and more drawn-out budget graphics card misery.

And yet to be fair to Nvidia those Lovelace graphics cards represent some seriously impressive pieces of engineering (adapter cables aside) with the RTX 4090 being ridiculously fast frankly (and a long way ahead of AMD’s rival RDNA 3 flagship albeit with outliers). DLSS 3 also looks very promising (with the caveats that we mentioned) early doors and RTX Remix is a seriously nifty idea too.

It’s not like there weren’t positives then but too many clouds of negativity were blotted across the sky for Nvidia this year. But even so guess what – Team Green is still by far the most dominant desktop GPU power. Indeed the latest stats we have at the time of writing (for Q3 2022 from Jon Peddie Research) show Nvidia with an 88% market share of discrete graphics cards. 88%! Or what we’d call a Google level of dominance.

Is Nvidia untouchable in the desktop GPU space? Could this level of domination be the reason why the company feels confident in pricing new GPUs the way it did with Lovelace? Well whatever the case Nvidia better not get too confident or comfortable on its GPU laurels as AMD has produced a compelling offering with its RX 7900 XTX flagship – one very much capable of taking on the RTX 4080 at a lower price point (as we write this) – and there’s more to come in the RDNA 3 range of course.

Things could start to change quite quickly if Nvidia doesn’t relent in the practice of pushing ever-dizzying premium pricing on its new GPUs because extracting every last dollar from gamers amidst a cost-of-living crisis could leave Team Green looking at a dwindling reservoir of goodwill in terms of its public perception. Which could lead to more people turning to AMD or maybe even Intel at the budget end of the GPU spectrum which Nvidia still seems unwilling to address in a meaningful way.

Let’s see how 2023 starts with the rumored RTX 4070 Ti launch supposed to be happening at CES and if that goes ahead as predicted then come on Nvidia: let’s have a pleasant surprise on the pricing front for once.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vaG93LXRvL3VuaW5zdGFsbC1udmlkaWEtYW1kLWludGVsLWdwdS1kcml2ZXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Upgrading Your GPU? Here's How to Totally Uninstall Old Nvidia AMD or Intel Graphics Drivers,"You've just taken your shiny new graphics card out of the box and you're ready to pull the old one out and replace it with the more powerful alternative. But before you upgrade the hardware or even if you've already done that it's never a bad idea to completely uninstall all the old Nvidia AMD and/or Intel drivers getting rid of all the cruft and potentially freeing up a decent amount of storage in the process.

Whether you're upgrading from one Nvidia card to another one or switching brands — going from Nvidia to AMD vice versa or even to an Intel Arc GPU — wiping out any remnants of the older card's software is a good idea. The old drivers could harm performance or even lead to crashes. Also if you're currently experiencing problems with a graphics card you've had for a while — crashes freezes blue screens — nuking your drivers and starting over from scratch could solve your issues.

You might think that uninstalling old graphics drivers is a simple process and on the surface it is. All three major GPU manufacturers provide the option to uninstall their respective drivers via the Control Panel. Furthermore you can elect to do a “clean install” when updating to the latest release. And a lot of the time things will go swimmingly with your PC and OS none the worse for wear.

But sometimes you end up with corrupted drivers that won’t uninstall properly or perhaps they uninstall but leave behind undesirable remnants (cruft). We’ve experienced situations where performance in a game inexplicably drops and the only way to ensure your drivers are clean is to really make sure they’re clean.

A handy utility appropriately called DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller) will do all the dirty work for you. It’s been around quite a few years now and gets routinely updated. It also has support for removing audio drivers as well as graphics. The important thing is that it’s programmed with all the knowledge of where AMD Intel and Nvidia store the various registry settings and files so it knows exactly where to look at what to delete.

How to Uninstall Nvidia AMD or Intel Graphics Drivers Using DDU

Follow these steps to get rid of every last piece of your old graphics drivers.

1. Download and launch the DDU installer from the Wagnardsoft website. This is free software but the company doesn't make it easy to find the correct download link because the pages are littered with ads that have ""download"" buttons in them that lead elsewhere.

The best bet is to find the ""download and support"" post for the latest version on Wagnardsoft's forums and click the ***Download DDU Here*** link. At publication time the latest forum post was for version V18.0.5.9 and going to that link would get you the download link.

2. Extract DDU to the folder of your choice. It will create a subfolder with a name that contains DDU and the version number. You'll get prompted when newer versions become available when you run the utility.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

3. Boot Windows into Safe Mode (optional). Wagnardsoft recommends that you boot into Safe Mode before running DDU but this is not absolutely necessary. We have used it in regular mode many times without issue. However if you're concerned that the program might miss something you can go into Safe Mode.

We have an article on how to boot to safe mode in Windows. (That applies to both Windows 10 and 11). The quick answer is to go to Settings->Recovery->Advanced Startup click Restart Now wait for it to restart select Troubleshoot->Advanced Options->Startup Settings->Restart and then enter 4 to Enable Safe Mode.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

4. Launch Display Driver Uninstaller.exe from the folder the extraction created. Click Yes if prompted by Windows User Account Control. This will bring up the full program. If you are not in Safe Mode the program will give a dialog box warning you that it recommends Safe Mode. You can click Ok and ignore it.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

5. Click Options if the program isn't already showing you the Options menu (which it does the first time you launch).

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

6. Uncheck ""Show offers from our partners"" and check ""Prevent downloads of drivers from 'Windows Update'"" (under Advanced). We also recommend unchecking ""Create a system restore point"" as that seems unnecessary and could be a waste of space. But if you're concerned you can leave it checked. Click Close when done.

7. Select GPU from the device type menu.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

It should automatically detect the brand of GPU that's currently installed and show it on screen. However if it gets this wrong you can choose the brand from another pulldown menu.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

If you have installed drivers from other vendors in the past you can select these from the pulldown menu and then click ""Clean and do NOT restart"" for each of them.

8. Click ""Clean and shutdown"" if you are planning to install a new graphics card right now. Click ""Clean and restart"" if you already have the GPU installed.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

DDU will take a minute or two to remove all the drivers and cruft from the brand of graphics card you selected. While it's going you will see status updates in DDU's log box. It will typically close any open Windows Explorer widows as well a slight annoyance at times if you're like us and have half a dozen locations open.

(Image credit: Future)

Remember if you select Nvidia it will only remove Nvidia drivers so if you have remnants of other branded drivers you will need to perform the process on those as well.

9. Install your new graphics card (if you haven't already).

10. Boot your PC and download and install the appropriate drivers. You can get them from the following locations:

Some text from the intro of this article also appeared in a recent issue of Maximum PC.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjZ2FtZXNuLmNvbS9udmlkaWEvZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtNDA5MC12cy00MDYw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 isn't as important as an RTX 4060,"There’s no denying that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is an awesome graphics card. It boasts unparalleled levels of performance out of the box that can go even further with DLSS 3 providing you can fit in your case and stomach its eye watering price tag. This latter point plays a large role in undermining the importance of team green’s flagship with the announcement of the company’s much more pivotal pixel pushers hopefully just over the horizon.

To be perfectly clear the RTX 4090 will remain the best graphics card money can buy for the foreseeable future with its closest competition (the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX) looking for a fight with the RTX 4080 instead. However there are fewer people that will buy let alone can afford such a costly GPU versus a prospective RTX 4070 4060 and 4050.

You need only take a look at any Steam Hardware Survey to see just how popular Nvidia’s mainstream offerings are and conversely how little prevalence 90 and 80 class graphics cards are among the user base. The GeForce GTX 1060 despite being six and a half years old remains the most popular pixel pusher on Valve’s platform with the RTX 2060 GTX 1650 RTX 3060 and 1050 Ti making up the rest of the top five GPUs.

There are a couple of reasons why 60 and 50 class graphics cards are so dominant among Steam users with an obvious one being price. The most expensive GPU out of that bunch cost $329 when it first launched and can be had for even less now. Looking at this data it’s pretty clear that while PC gamers strive to boost fps as high as possible the majority of them simply aren’t willing to break the bank for a higher frame rate.

Resolution understandably plays a big part in these purchase decisions too. The GeForce RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 to an extent are powerful enough for 4K gaming but the user base simply isn’t there yet. The prevalence of 1080p screens is undeniable with a whopping 65.08% market share among Steam users at the time of writing compared to the 13.42% enjoyed by 1440p and woefully small 2.33% adoption rate of 2160p.

Given that it makes more sense to upgrade your graphics card before bumping up the resolution of your gaming monitor it’ll likely take some time before the reign of 1080p comes to an end. Even 1440p hasn’t had its day in the sun like its HD counterpart. On the surface this could perhaps shift people away from waiting for this generation’s 50/60 class GPUs but they’ll likely be 4K performance powerhouses themselves armed with Nvidia DLSS 3.

Current rumours suggest that RTX 4060 performance will mirror the RTX 3070 which will be great if it launches for a competitive price. That said Nvidia’s next-gen (or perhaps current gen now) upscaling tech on its side increases its value versus its predecessors while diminishing the appeal of the more expensive GeForce graphics cards.

As hardware enthusiasts it’s easy to sometimes get caught up in the admittedly amazing things happening at the bleeding edge of technology. This has at least in my case warped how I view my own setup and created a completely misplaced fear of missing out on the latest and greatest technology like the GeForce RTX 4090.

Ultimately it’s not the most powerful GPUs that have come to define each generation of graphics card be it from Nvidia or AMD. In fact it’s the value oriented 50 and 60 class offerings that prove the most influential among PC builders and gamers alike making them the most important graphics cards.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9hbWQtZ3B1cy1oYXZlLXRoaXMtb25lLXVuc3VuZy1hZHZhbnRhZ2Utb3Zlci1udmlkaWEv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlnaXRhbHRyZW5kcy5jb20vY29tcHV0aW5nL2FtZC1ncHVzLWhhdmUtdGhpcy1vbmUtdW5zdW5nLWFkdmFudGFnZS1vdmVyLW52aWRpYS8_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD graphics cards have this one unsung advantage over Nvidia,"AMD graphics cards have gotten a lot of the limelight recently especially as the new RX 7900 XTX undercuts Nvidia’s RTX 4080 in performance. But as AMD has continued to refine its GPU performance another big area of improvement has been bubbling under the surface — AMD Software.

It’s been AMD Software Radeon Software Adrenalin and various other names in the past but regardless of the name AMD has continued to iterate and improve the software experience for its GPUs. And the version we have now is a big reason why AMD can go up against the best graphics cards.

Everything all in one place

The biggest perk of AMD Software is that all of your settings are in a single spot. That doesn’t seem like a big deal until you actually want to leverage the many software features available to Nvidia and AMD graphics cards.

Nvidia has a much different approach. You can see your games and some quick account settings in the GeForce Experience app. Your critical game and display settings though are only available in the drab Nvidia Control Panel. On top of that Nvidia’s features like Freestyle filters and Ansel are available in GeForce Experience but not in the desktop app. You can only find those in the overlay.

I’ve used Nvidia GPUs exclusively for close to a decade and I never used features like FreeStyle and Ansel in day-to-day use simply because I couldn’t be bothered to track down where to find them. I actively avoided GeForce Experience on my personal machine — the app would constantly kick me out and I’d have to sign back in to do something as simple as check for a driver update. The situation is even more convoluted now with Nvidia Broadcast. I had three Nvidia apps running on my PC at all times.

You don’t need to bounce through multiple apps and overlays to find features with AMD’s software.

AMD Software has everything in one spot both in the desktop app and in the overlay. On the desktop I can tune game settings and check for graphics drivers and in a game I can customize my picture settings while I’m playing rather than applying custom color settings in a dated app and hoping they stick (I’m looking at you Nvidia Control Panel). Or I can do it all on desktop or all in-game and that flexibility is great.

Overall AMD and Nvidia have very similar software features available. There are a few exceptions like Nvidia’s AI-enhanced camera features available through Broadcast but AMD and Nvidia allow you to easily optimize your game settings record and stream gameplay capture highlights and configure advanced graphics and display settings. The difference is that you don’t need to bounce through multiple apps and overlays to find those features with AMD’s software.

A smoother more robust experience

AMD Software has a few features that make it even more helpful than GeForce Experience too. For nerds like me something as small as the option to reset your shader cache can make a world of difference. A big plus for AMD Software though is the built-in GPU overclocking utility.

You’re not getting an advanced overclocking program but most GPUs don’t call for advanced overclocking in the first place. You can quickly boost your clock speed or memory speed with a slider and AMD includes a few one-click overclocking profiles as well. There’s even a built-in stress test to verify your overclock is stable. Nvidia supports one-click overclocking too but only through MSI Afterburner. It’s among the best GPU overclocking software but it’s yet another utility you need to add onto the Nvidia stack to get all of the features AMD has in a single app.

You have a lot of options with this utility too. The one-click settings are great but you can manually tune your GPU as well and even tie specific overclocking profiles to games. In Destiny 2 I noticed the Overclock VRAM profile helped smooth out my frame rate a lot so I have it applied only when I play that game. And every time I load up a game AMD Software shows a small overlay with what I have enabled so I don’t need to bounce back to the software to double-check.

Beyond overclocking AMD builds out its software with several quality-of-life features. There’s a snappy built-in browser for example so you can quickly look something up if you need to. There’s a search bar so you can find a setting without digging through menus. And once you have your settings configured how you want you can export them as a profile and import them later in case you’re switching machines or need to do a clean install.

You don’t need to sign in to AMD Software either. GeForce Experience requires an Nvidia account and you have to sign on to use any of its features. I’m not a privacy fanatic where a sign-on screen will send me into a frenzy but it’s annoying to constantly sign back into my Nvidia account just to use the features of a graphics card I paid for (especially when Nvidia’s social sign-on process is prone to fail).

Built-in overclocking a web browser the lack of a sign-on screen and various small extras like a search bar help AMD Software feel like a smoother more robust tool compared to GeForce Experience. That’s even before we bring in features like the AMD Link streaming utility which looks like a huge plus now that Nvidia is discontinuing its GameStream service.

Not without problems

AMD Software isn’t perfect though and it’s important to call out its flaws. For starters it’s prone to bugs. On several occasions settings menus simply wouldn’t display or the software would hang on a tab for a while. Restarting the app always resolved the issue but these bugs still pop up from time to time.

In addition the recommendations to tune your game settings are lacking. Nvidia includes a one-click optimization feature in GeForce Experience that will automatically tune your settings based on your hardware. It’s not perfect but it provides a good starting point to tune your performance. AMD Software provides highly general suggestions like “decrease image quality” and “reduce display resolution” which are far less helpful.

My biggest issue is the overlay. Over and over the overlay would slow my entire screen down to around 15 frames per second (including my game) and slowly bring up my settings. AMD Software is robust but the byproduct of doing so much is that it causes your machine to slow to a crawl when you cram so many features into a game overlay.

I’ve found that using Alt + Tab is the best way to go if I need to adjust settings (AMD Software is very friendly on that front). Otherwise I’ve mainly used the hotkeys to do things like save a recording or take a screenshot. On the plus side you can customize your hotkeys and it would be interesting to get everything set up through something like an Elgato Stream Deck in the future.

An unsung hero

There’s plenty to talk about on the performance front between AMD and Nvidia and ultimately that’s what matters most when choosing a GPU. AMD Software doesn’t always get the attention it should though. It’s packed full of features that unlock so much more for your graphics card outside of just playing games.

Nvidia has these features as well and in some cases Nvidia goes further. Admittedly I’ve missed the smooth background blur and auto-framing provided by Nvidia Broadcast as well as the ray tracing filter available through FreeStyle.

Still I’ve enjoyed how much AMD Software has to offer and how much I’ve experimented with it. Saving GIFs instantly from my games tuning overclocking settings on a per-title basis tweaking color settings to get my games looking just right … the list goes on. AMD and Nvidia both have their pros and cons but I’ve undoubtedly used AMD Software far more than I ever used GeForce Experience.

Here's something most HotHardware readers probably know: the same GPU core is used for many different models of graphics card. Case in point: the GA102 processor is used for every GeForce RTX 3000-series model from the RTX 3080 on up the stack . However what you may not know is that it can go the other way: sometimes a single GPU model can be made from multiple different processors depending on what NVIDIA has available.

Apparently the GeForce RTX 3050 is joining the rank of those graphics cards created out of more than one GPU design. There are already two separate models of GeForce RTX 3050 card: one based on GA106 with 2560 shaders and another  typically only found in OEM systems that is also based on GA106 but with only 2304 shaders (two SMs disabled).





The text is very small so click this image.



The previous desktop GeForce RTX 3050 cards were quite considerably cut-down from the larger GA106 die that is used in fully-enabled form on the mobile Geforce RTX 3060  with fully a third of its shaders and memory bus disabled. That's rather wasteful unless NVIDIA had a pile of GA106 dice that couldn't pass muster as RTX 3060s.









Well there's an MSI listing for a new ""OCV1"" model of GeForce RTX 3050 with once again 2560 shaders but a lower power draw of 115W. That's down from the 130W of the original ""OC"" model. Thanks to the drop it gets to step down to a six-pin power connector instead of an eight-pin plug. MSI hasn't confirmed anything but the specifications of the card rather neatly match those of the fully-enabled GA107 die.Given that the GeForce RTX 3050's specifications were already a perfect match for the GA107 die it may seem like NVIDIA planned this pairing all along. Of course we're not likely to ever know the truth about that but it's very likely that the insane state of the graphics card market over the last couple of years forced NVIDIA to change its plans on the fly just as it did everyone else.As for why the company is making this swap now it's difficult to say. Perhaps the demand for laptops with GA107-based RTX 3050 Ti and RTX 3050 GPUs has waned or perhaps it's because demand for GeForce RTX 3060 cards has increased. Likely it's a combination of multiple factors like the fact that a tremendous majority of Steam gamers are still using 20- 16- and 10-series GPUs. It's easy to think of the RTX 30 series as ""last-generation"" but it'll probably be a year or more before we see Ada Lovelace trickle down to the ""x50"" tier.You needn't pore over the specifications for the two cards; they're identical aside from the lower power consumption spec on the new model. That could mean that the new GeForce RTX 3050s can hit higher clock rates but that depends on whether any vendors bother to build a card with relatively robust power delivery. Certainly the big dual-fan cooler on these MSI cards is overkill for the little GA107 GPU."

Peter Sebetic a lifelong Kenosha resident bought the business located at 2929 Roosevelt Road in September and has spent several months working on extensive renovations to the building. That includes work on the roof plumbing and a complete remodeling of the interior.

“People eat with their eyes I want to provide a nice clean place for people” Sebetic said.

Work is expected to be completed in late January with Sebetic saying he hopes to open on his doors Feb. 1 with reduced times and hours. After the winter Sebetic plans to expand the operation hours and add car hops.

Sebetic has known the previous owner Ken Anderson much of his life. He’s been in the restaurant business for over a decade in one form or another. When Anderson closed his doors last February he jumped at the chance to run his own business.

“It sat vacant for a very long time I approached him about selling the business to me” Sebetic said. “I wanted to be an entrepreneur I wanted to be an owner and operator of a restaurant.”

The remodeled restaurant will be an “old-school diner” Sebetic said offering a retro experience with affordable and high quality food. It’s something he felt was lacking.

“It brings a diner experience back to Kenosha it brings the legacy of Andy’s back” Sebetic said. “I want to get this back to being a staple of the community.”

The retro diner will be a family-friendly location Sebetic said and emphasized that it would be a local restaurant run by a Kenosha family as it had been with the previous family.

“I want to provide a good experience to people and their families” Sebetic said.

There’s still plenty of work ahead as remodeling continues and Sebetic said he plans to start hiring staff in the coming weeks. There’s also plenty of big plans in the works with Sebetic hoping to do community-focused events and sponsorships in the future including the return of the weekly cruise-in car shows.",,,,,,,,,,,,

America is one of the world's most industrialized regions with the largest economy in nominal terms. This also makes it one of the world's largest consumers of electricity ranking second only to China through 3.9 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2021. In terms of sources of energy consumption petroleum and natural gas account for the largest sources and renewable energy ranks in third place. Sector wise industrial transportation and electrical power use are the largest electricity consumers in the U.S. and natural gas is the most widely used production source according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Courtesy of some of the best educational institutions in the world the U.S. is also leading the charge in researching innovative mediums for generating renewable energy. Not only is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) an American firm the world's first car maker to successfully mass produce an electric vehicle but researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are investigating methods to improve electricity generation through waves and the Sun as well as new mediums to store electricity. While solar cells are common these days these materials are unable to tap the vast amounts of energy that the Sun beams down to the Earth. On this front MIT is searching for materials that are cost effective scalable reliable and efficient at the same time. To do this they are utilizing machine learning and rapid experimentation to quickly sift through materials in hopes that a new one will provide a breakthrough.

When talking about energy any discussion would be incomplete without nuclear power plants. There are two kinds of nuclear reactions fission and fusion. With the former atoms are split up to squeeze out energy from them. However the latter is vastly more powerful (and complex) since it requires squeezing the atoms together and the resulting energy is harnessed as power. Fusion is the Sun's primary energy source and all nuclear plants in the world use fission instead. In the area of fusion the U.S. federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California was able to generate more energy from a Hydrogen plasma bombarded with lasers than the electricity used in operating the lasers instead. This was a crucial breakthrough since fusion is the most efficient and cleanest source of power - even on the nuclear front as it does not generate any radioactive waste.

Story continues

Additionally America also passed one of the most important pieces of legislation for renewable energy this year in form of the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill provides roughly $370 billion in government subsidies for clean power generation. This provides the incentive for even some of the biggest American energy companies to invest in the field. Finally global crude oil prices have injected fresh rigor into renewable energy production after they jumped to a whopping $139 per barrel earlier this year in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Today we'll take a look at the largest American energy firms with the top picks being Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE).

After reaching out to dozens of schools the all-state and all-region sprinter fell in love with Ferrum College.

“I spent the whole fall of my senior year through December just reaching out to schools” Hamm said in a recent phone interview. “And I went to my first visit at Ferrum and I just fell in love immediately. The team was so welcoming the coaches just truly understood me on a level that my high school coach understood me. I just fell in love right there.”

Hamm’s good friend fellow PCHS senior at the time Kevin Nester was in a similar predicament looking for a school where he could play tennis. Hamm told Nester the 2021 Piedmont District singles champion to get in touch with the coaches at Ferrum.

“I just wanted the opportunity play the sport that I fell in love with in high school at the college level” Nester said. “I had some offers from different schools some in the ODAC some in other conferences but really ultimately what happened with me going to Ferrum was Michael. He got me in touch with Coach (Rod) Baker at Ferrum and I had a meeting with him (Baker) and he actually called me that night and I had a visit the next day. So everything just kind of worked out.”

“I was just nervous meeting people at the moment and Kevin was like ‘I don’t have anywhere to go’ and I was just like ‘Well come with me. I know you you know me it’ll make it a lot easier for both of us’” Hamm added.

Two years later Nester and Hamm are in their second year as roommates at Ferrum and have only strengthened their friendship through working through college and collegiate athletics together.

As a freshman last spring Nester finished runner-up in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference Rookie of the Year award voting and was the winningest player on Ferrum’s men’s tennis team. This fall he and his doubles partner won an invitational tournament at Mary Baldwin College.

Hamm broke a Ferrum indoor track record in the 400-meter-dash and medaled in both the 400 at the ODAC Indoor Track championship and the 200-meter-dash at the ODAC Outdoor Track championship earning All-Conference honors in both.

Both former Cougars found a lot of success early in their college careers. It wasn’t an easy transition from high school to college but they found having each other made the move easier especially when they were going through slumps or tough times mentally.

The two will often do workouts with each other to push one another and let their friend know they’re not alone.

“The biggest thing for me and I’ve told Michael this a thousand times was me and him rooming together” Nester said. “Even though we played two different sports we’re basically teammates to each other. We push each other to do workouts with each other to be better.

“That’s how we were in high school. We wanted to be the best that we could and that translated to us being roommates and being athletes at Ferrum too.”

“Just keeping each other positive letting each other know we’re here for each other” Hamm said.

Both athletes have taken a bit of Patrick County with them to Ferrum but they’re also still very much attached to their hometown. They continue to follow Cougars athletics closely and still keep up with their old coaches and teammates.

Last spring Nester would often go to PCHS tennis practices on his days off and Cougars coach Andrew Terry would let him do some student-coaching.

“It allows you to build bonds with the team that’s still there so that they know you’re there for them” Nester said. “Because you’ve been there before and just to let them see that they can do it they can see a positive influence.”

Hamm and Nester have big goals for the rest of their college careers. Hamm said he wants to keep breaking records but more than anything he wants to win a conference championship.

Both athletes said they have finite goals but they also want to continue to represent Patrick County in a positive way.

“We don’t really see that many athletes go represent at the next level from Patrick County and I just want to represent my high school well” Hamm said.

“I think me and Mike have built really really strong legacies for ourselves here but we can do a lot with triple that amount of time left” Nester said. “I think it’s big to represent where you’re from… Even the ones that do don’t get the credit that they deserve so just to be able to have your name out there and show we’re a small school but we can do that.”

Both athletes had a message for young athletes in Patrick County who would like to emulate their careers and their friendships in the future.

“The biggest message I would have is that no matter what you think... if you think that people aren’t watching there’s going to be people that are watching and you can get your name out there no matter what sport it is” Nester said. “But especially track and tennis those are really good opportunities. Even as small as Patrick County is I think me and Michael are a really good examples of that.”

“Just let them know that no matter who you are or what you do athletically you can achieve any dream you have” Hamm added. “You’ve just got to really push it because it’s hard to get your name out in that area but if you put all your time and effort in it’ll pay off.”"

( SKC Co.)

SKC Co. a chemical materials unit of SK Group said Sunday it will present a range of key products including a semiconductor glass substrate battery-grade copper foil and bioplastics at an upcoming US tech exhibition next week.

The glass substrate considered a ""game changer"" in semiconductor packaging will be unveiled to the public for the first time at the Consumer Electronics Show due to take place in Las Vegas from Jan. 5-8 SKC said.

SKC is investing up to $600 million to build a glass substrate production facility in the US state of Georgia.

A glass substrate refers to a thin layer of glass on which chips can be mounted together to build the brains of the advanced computing system. It takes up less space compared with plastic or silicon-based substrates allowing the chipsets to significantly improve performance and energy efficiency.

SKC's US subsidiary Absolics Inc. aims to become the first in the industry to mass produce the key material.

Copper foil a key anode component in lithium-ion battery cells used in electric vehicles will be on display. The foil-making unit SK Nexilis touts the technology will produce copper foil 4 micrometers thick -- about one-thirtieth the thickness of a human hair -- 1.4 meters wide and 77 kilometers in length: the world's thinnest widest and longest according to SKC.

Silicon anode material an emerging EV battery component that enhances mileage and battery recharging speeds will be exhibited at this year's show. SKC has invested in British battery materials maker Nexeon for collaboration in silicon anodes.

SKC will also join a ""food truck"" event to be hosted by an SK affiliate which will serve alternative foods such as plant-based milk and alternative meat on plastic plates with cutlery made from SKC's biodegradable polymer.

Since that time Texas Instruments has made additional investments in the facility known in the industry as a “fab” which includes multiple buildings with over 2 million square feet of space a few miles east of I-15 in Lehi. The fabrication facility has been in operation since the 1990s previously specializing in building memory chips.

Now a year-long renovation is complete and the fab is in production an ultra high-tech process that begins with a slice of pure silicon and ends around 12 weeks later with a wholly transformed 300 millimeter wafer that can contain hundreds or even thousands of tiny microchips.

Texas Instruments says the Lehi facility has plenty of room for future expansion and has $3 billion to $4 billion in investments planned for the Utah fab. Company executives note it’s just one of multiple projects the company currently has underway as it works to greatly expand its semiconductor manufacturing capacity. A new chip fab facility in Dallas started production this year and a massive buildout is underway in Sherman Texas with two new plants under construction and two more in the planning stages.

Brian Dunlap Texas Instruments’ vice president for 300-mm Wafer Fab Manufacturing Operations said the Lehi facility is a key component in his company’s overall expansion plans.

“We couldn’t be more excited about the expansion potential here in Lehi” Dunlap said. “Our technology and capacity expansion road map ... is going to change our ability to be able to support our customers.”

Why microchips matter

For something so tiny and mostly unseen by consumers the terms used to describe the importance of the microchip might seem entirely out of proportion.

They are the foundation of modern life. The engines that drive innovation. The technology responsible for connecting the world. And they may be the key to the future of world security.

And to be sure you can find a microchip — also sometimes referred to simply as a chip computer chip or integrated circuit — in virtually every device that requires power to operate and quite a few that don’t.

There’s one embedded in your cash card as well as your passport. The cellphone wouldn’t exist without them nor would your computer your television or increasingly any of your home appliances. Vehicles with gas engines have hundreds of them and next-generation electric cars have thousands. They’re the actual brains behind every “smart” “connected” or “virtual” product out there and research is well underway to integrate these tiny electronic engines directly into our own brains.

Microchips are getting smaller more powerful and are in such growing demand that manufacturers can’t build the pricey and complex facilities that make them fast enough to keep pace.

While the U.S. is the birthplace of the technology that led to the microchip and the country where almost 40% of the chips were once manufactured that leadership position has declined dramatically over the past few decades. That diminished role was defined in the harsh light of pandemic-fueled supply chain disruptions where the lack of robust domestic microchip supply upended the manufacturing processes for a slew of American-made goods that rely on them.

And while some relief has come as COVID-19 restrictions have lifted and global manufacturing volumes have returned to near pre-pandemic levels industry experts predict shortages could remain an issue into 2024.

That economic lesson helped rally bipartisan support to pass a massive $280 billion legislative package this summer. Backers of the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act are hoping the funding will help push the U.S. back into a command position when it comes to developing and manufacturing microchips.

What does the $280 billion CHIPS Act do?

The legislation provides more than $52 billion in grants and other incentives for the semiconductor industry as well as a 25% tax credit for those companies that invest in chip plants in the U.S. It also calls for increased spending on various research programs that would total about $200 billion over 10 years according to the Congressional Budget Office.

In a statement following passage of the bill in July Texas Instruments spokeswoman Ellen Fishpaw said the CHIPS legislation would provide a boost for U.S. chip makers as they vie for market share with powerful global competitors.

“We applaud Congress for passing the CHIPS Act” Fishpaw said. “This is an important piece of legislation that will boost domestic chip production and improve the U.S. semiconductor industry’s ability to remain competitive.

“Texas Instruments has an exciting manufacturing roadmap which includes investments in Lehi and these provisions will be very meaningful to the development of wafer fabs to support semiconductor demand for decades to come.”

Texas Instruments reported $5.2 billion in revenue in the third quarter of 2022 and $2.3 billion in net earnings. Overall revenues were up 13% from the same period in 2021.

In an earnings call following release of the third quarter report Texas Instruments Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi said the CHIPS Act was set to accelerate domestic chip production capacity and was already bearing benefits for the Dallas-based company.

“The combination of the investment tax credit the grant as well as funding for research and development will help make the U.S. semiconductor industry more competitive” Lazardi said. “We accrued about $50 million on the balance sheet in third quarter due to the 25% investment tax credit for investments in our U.S. factories.”

Texas Instruments’ Utah investment is big for a lot of reasons

The Lehi chip fab plant is the only one of its kind in Utah but beside the billions of dollars in investment it’s attracted as a stand-alone facility in the state industry watchers say its economic impact will extend far beyond its 700-acre site.

Stephen LeFevre chief of staff and director of strategic and foreign affairs for World Trade Center Utah said investments like the one Texas Instruments has committed to in Lehi are setting up for positive exponential downstream impacts to Utah’s economy.

“Texas Instruments’ investment creates an external economy of scale” LeFevre said. “Other related industries will continue to grow and develop and bring more and more similar and related businesses to Utah.”

Beside being a powerful attractor of additional business interest in Utah LeFevre said the plant itself will be a talent incubator via Texas Instruments’ robust internship program which is set to offer emerging tech professionals with real-world experience in some of the most advanced technology areas.

And he noted Texas Instruments’ confidence in making such a huge bet on Utah is further evidence that the state is on point when it comes to its portfolio of core essentials attracting more big interest from big businesses.

“I think there’s a growing acknowledgment of Utah’s fertile engine for investments like this” LeFevre said. “Our highly educated population homegrown tech talent business friendly policies and high levels of coordination across the public and private sectors all set us up well for more success stories like this.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3NhbXN1bmctZWxlY3Ryb25pY3MtYWltcy10by1leHBhbmQtc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3Rvci1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLWF0LXAzLWZhY3RvcnktMTIyMTIyNjAwNDc1XzEuaHRtbNIBlgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9zYW1zdW5nLWVsZWN0cm9uaWNzLWFpbXMtdG8tZXhwYW5kLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1hdC1wMy1mYWN0b3J5LTEyMjEyMjYwMDQ3NV8xLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Samsung Electronics aims to expand semiconductor production at P3 factory,"Samsung Electronics is reportedly planning to expand its semiconductor production at its P3 factory in Pyeongtaek South Korea which is the company's largest chip manufacturing facility.

This move contrasts with the reduction in investment by rival chipmakers global economic slowdowns and declining demand reports SamMobile.

According to experts in the industry the tech giant is considering the expansion of its chip production in order to outperform its competitors and support the share price of the company once the market recovers.

The expansion plans include a 12-inch wafer capacity for DRAM chips.

Additionally the company intends to increase the plant's 4nm chip capacity which will be built under the foundry contracts the report said.

Meanwhile last week Samsung Electronics had announced the development of its 16GB dynamic RAM built using the industry's first 12-nanometer (nm)-class process technology.

With mass production set to begin in 2023 the company said ""its new DRAM will advance next-generation computing data centres and AI applications with industry-leading performance and greater power efficiency"".

Financial institution recruiters and tech executives consider location organizational structure and reporting structure when they are filling or applying for top technologist roles said Robert Voth managing director at executive search firm Russell Reynolds.

""COVID reset the chess table with a piece that companies had never seen before which is open location"" Voth said. ""Prior to the spring of 2020 the vast majority of CIOs moved to corporate headquarters. At the end of 2022 less than half of our searches required their chief information officer to be at corporate.""

About 70% of companies want their top technologist based at headquarters according to Jesse Reich an executive director of Russell Reynolds. In contrast about the same percentage of talent is unmotivated to relocate.

Additionally Voth said reporting structure is vital. He added that companies that don't have their chief technologists reporting to the top executive officers lose more than half of the potential talent pool.

Control of data and analytics is what Voth called ""the bait that hooks the big fish."" Top technologists want oversight because data is the key to a better understanding of customers Reich said.

Even as economic strain on the tech industry has meant more layoffs at many fintechs and Big tech companies the executive technology roles at financial institutions have remained stable Reich said.

""If you need a top technology officer you still need one in a downturn"" Reich said.

New Zealand elevator and escalator market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.32% during 2021-2027

Increasing demand for high-rise structures and the government's focus on infrastructure in key economic cities have propelled New Zealand's elevator and escalator market to new heights.



The New Zealand elevator market by the installed base is expected to reach 18462 units by 2028. Green star-rated building One Queen Street in Auckland will be redeveloped and comprises 14300 sqm commercial space with an investment of USD 174 million. In its second stage a commercial bay will comprise luxurious hotels office space and retail space with an investment of USD 1 billion and is anticipated to be finished by 2023. This redevelopment will give support to the New Zealand elevator and escalator market.



Escalators used in the public transit sector accounted for the largest share of around 38.5% in 2021 due to increasing public transit projects in the pipeline. The New Zealand escalators market by the installed base is expected to reach 5213 units by 2028.



KEY HIGHLIGHTS



The Artificial Intelligence Forum of New Zealand (AIFNZ) aims to increase New Zealanders' knowledge of artificial intelligence (AI) and its capabilities. The swift development of AI technologies presents significant opportunities and difficulties. The University of Auckland will get millions of dollars from the New Zealand government to better investigate and embrace the power of artificial intelligence (AI). In 2019 about NZ$ 4 million was committed to this field of study.

The Emissions Reduction Plan outlines the steps that will be taken to satisfy the first emissions budget (2022-2025) and it puts us on the right track to comply with the second and third emissions budgets (2026- 2030). This will make it possible to transition to a low-emission future feasibly and cheaply. Every action and initiative the Building for Climate Change program takes will be in collaboration with the building and construction industry to ensure everything is implemented correctly.

Currently 20% of New Zealand's carbon emissions are attributable to the built environment. The council is recommending that the Building Code be modified in three stages with the use of fossil fuels being completely phased out by 2030 and restricted to new construction by 2026. There are currently more than 3000 green construction projects underway around the nation. These include 170 newly certified Green Star buildings with another 70 undergoing evaluation.

Wellington has 152 personal cable cars also known as incline lifts. In the past the city's hills were home to over 300 personal cable cars but regulations were implemented in 2005. The demand for cable cars and inclined elevators has increased due to their ability to increase a property's worth and the fact that accessible locations in Wellington are getting more challenging to obtain. Depending on the terrain installing one can cost between USD 150000 and USD 200000 in addition to ongoing maintenance expenses.

The cost of numerous essential commodities for construction projects including steel and timber has skyrocketed. In contrast the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the supply chain for materials and labor can be traced as the problem's origin. New obstacles such as geopolitical risks like the Ukraine War continue to pressure prices at a time when demand is rising due to government-led infrastructure projects. The cost of building new homes rose by 18% in the March 2022 quarter compared to the March 2021 quarter the fastest growth ever observed since the survey launched in 1985 according to the most recent Stats NZ Consumer Price Index.

A Rise In Residential And Commercial Building Activity Is Expected To Drive The New Zealand elevator and escalator market



Canterbury authorities have experienced an increase in new dwelling building authorizations in 2022 compared to 2021 after a relatively stagnant growth in new dwelling permits across most communities. With 23.1 new permits given per 1000 residents in the Selwyn District in 2021-2022 it continues to have the highest proportion followed by the Mackenzie District with 15. The lowest rate was three per 1000 inhabitants in Waimate District.

Auckland Council has financed around USD 257 million for a high-rise mixed-use residential project around Aotea train station. The development comprises nine levels of commercial space a public plaza and 60 apartments. After the completion of the City rail link in 2024 construction of Aotea Central will commence.

An agreement between New Zealand's SkyCity Entertainment Group and the Government of New Zealand was established to complete the extended project of the New Zealand International Convention center (NZICC). This project is still under planning and is anticipated to be completed in 2024. The development is worth USD 427 million.

With an investment of USD 142 million from Australian developers Ninety-four feet are commencing the construction of a hotel & luxury apartment tower in Auckland Wellington and Queenstown. Initial decommissioning was completed and IconCoPty Ltd (NZ) signed a contract to deliver 41 levels 225 rooms hotel Indigo Auckland and mixed-use development. Such development plans will propel the growth of the New Zealand elevator and escalator market.



Governments Effort To Expand Infrastructure Across Nation To Increase The Demand For New Installations



The increasing population drives the plan of shifting the Port of Auckland to Northland where there is an addition of 77ha of prime waterfront land for public and a new cruise terminal. It is estimated to value around ~USD 6 billion to shift the port and is anticipated to be finished by 2036.

Enabling works of the Auckland Airport Transport hub began in June 2022. The development is worth USD 189 million transforming how people commute directly to the airport. This project is under construction and is expected to be finished by 2027.

One of New Zealand's most significant transportation projects the Karangahape Station is a part of CRL with an investment of USD 2.5billion. This was a 3.45km underground twin tunnel rail line below Auckland City Center. This project is still under construction and is scheduled for completion in 2024.



Regulations For Maintenance of Elevators And Escalators In New Zealand By Building Act To Create Demand



Maintenance and modernization in the New Zealand elevator and escalator market accounted for 69.7% and 30.3% respectively for 2021.

Since there has been a 40% increase in accidents in New Zealand from 2011 to 2016. In the year 2015 the country implemented the Building Act. The Building Act acknowledges the value of elevators to the built environment and the possible risk to life safety they may present. Checks are therefore necessary during the design stage throughout construction and after it is finished. The Building Act mandates routine inspections and maintenance to ensure the elevator maintains its approved standard.



REGIONAL ANALYSIS



Auckland has always been the largest market for construction and building contributing around 40% to the total national construction value and 42% of new dwellings approved in 2021.

All Canterbury authorities have experienced an increase in new dwelling building authorizations in 2022 compared to 2021 after a relatively stagnant increase in new dwelling permits across most communities.

“We see great importance in the entry of banks and additional new players into the banking system in Israel so that they contribute to increasing competition and innovation in the financial system” stated Yaron. “It is evident that the group of entrepreneurs is diverse and brings with it strengths in various fields including entrepreneurs with international technological and business experience.”

Passing the initial regulatory hurdle and the receipt of the control permit will allow the group of entrepreneurs establishing the digital bank to move forward with the mechanical operational and regulatory preparations required for the start of the bank’s operations. This will include testing phases of the new technology completing the recruitment of the management team and hiring additional bank staff. The establishment process is expected to take about a one-and-a-half years the central bank said.

“We have a long way to go” said Hauser. “The uniqueness of our bank is the synergy between technology and banking.”

Hauser announced that the “groundbreaking” Israeli technology will allow for extraordinary operational efficiency that will be rolled out directly to customers.

“This will be reflected in attractive interest rates banking services without commissions without subscription fees and without preconditions such as salary transfer” he remarked.

The new bank will be supervised by the Bank of Israel’s supervisor of banks to ensure its stability and to safeguard its depositors’ funds similar to the oversight of other banks in Israel. Like every other bank in Israel the new lender will have access to all of the Bank of Israel’s monetary instruments.

Esh follows in the heels of the first fully digital bank One Zero Digital Bank Ltd. set up by tech entrepreneur Amnon Shashua the nation’s first new bank in more than 40 years. Last year the lender received final regulatory approval after being granted a banking license from the Bank of Israel in 2019 in a bid to inject competition into the sector.

It's tough knowing where to invest right now. The stock market has been in the doldrums all year and 2023 isn't looking much better. There are serious concerns that the Federal Reserve will push interest rates too high and cause a steep economic downturn.

But if we look past all this uncertainty we can see a few longer-term growth trends that should remain strong over the coming years. Three of the biggest megatrends are:

Decarbonization : The economy is transitioning to lower-carbon energy sources.

Digitization : Businesses are undergoing digital transformation initiatives to bring more of their business processes online.

Deglobalization : Countries are shifting their supply chains onshore to improve their resilience.

Because of that companies working to capitalize on these themes should thrive in the coming years. That's why the best place to invest $5000 (or any other amount) is across these megatrends. Here are five companies aligning their businesses to capitalize on one or more of these themes.

The data infrastructure leader

American Tower (AMT -1.01%) is one of the largest global real estate investment trusts (REITs). The company operates 222000 communications sites worldwide and over two dozen U.S. data centers.

This infrastructure is crucial for increased digitization. Growing data use from 5G streaming cloud computing and other digitization trends is driving the need for more mobile-communications infrastructure and data centers. According to one estimate companies must invest $1 trillion over the next five years to upgrade global data infrastructure.

That should enable American Tower to add more tenants to its existing towers and data centers develop new sites and continue to acquire locations. These drivers position the REIT to continue growing its cash flow and dividend at above-average rates over the next few years.

The megatrend infrastructure investor

Brookfield Infrastructure (BIPC -0.69%) (BIP 0.23%) is a global infrastructure investor with operations across the utility energy midstream transportation and data sectors. The company is increasingly focused on investments aligned with the digitization decarbonization and deglobalization trends.

Brookfield has built a leading data infrastructure portfolio with towers fiber optic networks and data centers. It's also capitalizing on deglobalization by helping semiconductor giant Intel onshore manufacturing capacity by financing the construction of two new plants in the U.S.

On top of that it's investing in several decarbonization initiatives. The company expects these themes to power organic growth at or above the top end of its 6% to 9% annual target range in the coming years. That should support 5% to 9% annual dividend growth.

Securing the digital transformation

Palo Alto Networks (PANW 0.61%) is a global leader in cybersecurity. Network security is becoming increasingly important as more companies digitize their businesses and hybrid work becomes the norm.

Meanwhile cyberthreats are growing more complex and costly. According to Cybersecurity Ventures global cybercrime costs will balloon to $10.5 trillion annually by 2025 up from $3 trillion in 2015. Palo Alto Network built a three-platform strategy to help clients secure their digital transformation. That's leading it to gain market share as customers consolidate their network security with the company's integrated platform and best-of-breed capabilities.

The logistics real estate leader

Prologis (PLD -0.61%) is the global leader in logistics real estate with 1 billion square feet of space across 19 countries. Demand for warehouse space has skyrocketed since the pandemic driven by the accelerated adoption of e-commerce and shifting inventory-management practices to improve supply chain resiliency.

These digitization and globalization drivers have the REIT expecting to grow its same-site net operating income at an 8% to 10% annual rate for the next few years as legacy leases expire and are repriced to higher market rates. In addition the company expects to develop additional warehouse capacity.

According to global commercial real estate company CBRE the U.S. will need an additional 330 million square feet of distribution space by 2025 to handle the expected growth of e-commerce sales alone.

The clean energy king

NextEra Energy (NEE -1.06%) is the world's largest producer of wind and solar energy and a global leader in battery storage. It's investing billions of dollars annually to grow its renewable energy capacity and build additional clean energy infrastructure.

These investments have the utility on pace to grow its adjusted earnings per share by as much as 10% per year through 2025. That should support around 10% annual growth in its dividend through 2024. Overall the company sees upward of $4 trillion in investment opportunities to fully decarbonize the U.S. economy over the next 30 years.

Positioned to prosper

Over the coming years companies will invest trillions of dollars in digitizing decarbonizing and deglobalizing their operations. That will benefit the companies focused on capitalizing on these megatrends like American Tower Brookfield Infrastructure Palo Alto Networks Prologis and NextEra Energy. Because of that investors could do very well by investing $5000 across those five stocks over the next five years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vZW4uZ2xvYmVzLmNvLmlsL2VuL2FydGljbGUtYmFuay1vZi1pc3JhZWwtYXdhcmRzLWxpY2Vuc2UtdG8tZXNoLWRpZ2l0YWwtYmFuay0xMDAxNDMzNjgy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bank of Israel awards license to Esh digital bank,"The Bank of Israel has awarded a conditional banking license to a digital banking venture led by Israeli businessman Nir Zuk the founder of cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks (Nasdaq: PANW).

The new digital bank which will be called Esh will offer current accounts to private business and corporate customers and the self-employed. The bank will provide deposit accounts loans payments and credit cards. According to the business plan presented to the Supervisor of Banks Esh will set up a bank without physical branches based on innovative technology that it is developing itself focusing on the provision of banking services.

The consortium led by Zuk is required by the Bank of Israel to hold at least $50 million in equity. Other members of the founding group include former Israel securities Authority chairman Shmuel Hauser businessman Yuval Aloni and Kobi Malkin the former CEO of Bank Massad and Bank Otsar Hahayal who will serve as Esh's CEO.

Bank of Israel Governor Prof. Amir Yaron today gave the representatives of the new digital bank a conditional license to establish a bank and the permits to control it. The Governor also granted a holding permit in the bank to Prof. Shmuel Hauser who is expected to serve as the new bank's chairman. Receipt of the control permits and the conditional bank license awarded by the Governor and Supervisor of Banks Yair Avidan will allow the owners to move forward and complete the technical operational and regulatory preparations required to start the bank's operations. This will include completing the development and testing stages of the new technology completing the recruitment of the management team and the additional manpower required to establish the bank and build policies procedures and processes in its main areas of activity. The establishment period of the bank will last about 18 months and the process will be carried out in consultation with the licensing committee.

The Bank of Israel said that awarding the conditional license and permits was undertaken after a comprehensive and in-depth process carried out by the Supervisor of Banks over the last two years after examining the business plan submitted. This process included a fit and proper check investigating the honesty integrity and financial strength of the entrepreneurs and supporting them in the required regulatory preparation.

The new bank will be overseen by the Bank of Israel's Supervisor of Banks to ensure its stability and to safeguard depositors' money similar to the supervision of other banks in Israel. The new bank like any other bank in Israel will have access to all the liquidity tools of the Bank of Israel (monetary loans and monetary deposits). The new bank will also be able to manage an account at the Bank of Israel and connect to the various payment systems thus being able to provide all the retail services that banks provide to their customers.

""We will completely change the cost structure""

Businessman Yuval Aloni one of the founders of the new bank said ""Esh's first product will be current accounts. However our long-term plan is to build a variety of products including competitively priced loans. We built the bank in such a way that completely changes the cost structure and the money saved will be transparently passed on to customers. I can personally guarantee that there will be no account management fees we will not request the transfer of the existing account or the salary and that the following products will also include payments options and issuing international credit cards for households and businesses.

Last year the bank began raising funds from Israeli institutional bodies and according to market estimates they tried to raise funds at a valuation of about NIS 2 billion. Since then there have been falls in global capital markets inflation has soared and interest rates in Israel and around the world have risen causing many investors to tighten their belts and tighten the conditions for investments. Despite this the bank estimates that the full amount will be raised although probably at a lower amount than was initially planned but complying with requirements for obtaining a license.

The longterm effects of that are still too early to call. But as quickly as Netflix can greenlight a show and cancel it after one season streaming platforms as we know them are already undergoing fundamental shifts.

Some of these changes have already taken effect while others are impending but they all point to the apparent future where the streaming experience feels reminiscent of watching TV via cable and satellite where commercial breaks abound and channels (streamers) can be bought in bundles. Oddly enough recent moves at Warner Bros. Discovery hint that streaming may even be trying to revert back to some old television practices just done through a streaming lens.

With the new year on the horizon here are the big changes coming to the streaming experience in 2023.

HBO Max Moving Shows to Fast Channels

Warner Bros. Discovery’s shocking HBO Max and Discovery+ removals have extended to HBO originals not just streaming exclusives. The canceled Westworld and The Nevers will soon be available only on WBD’s upcoming FAST (Free Ad-supported Streaming TV) channel removing the viewer ability to choose which season/episode they want to stream.

The following shows will soon be streaming on WBD’s FAST channel on a loop for viewers to tune into:

Westworld – Seasons 1 2 3 4

The Nevers – Season 1

Raised by Wolves – Seasons 1 2

FBOY Island – Seasons 1 2

Legendary – Seasons 1 2 3

Finding Magic Mike – Season 1

Head of the Class – Season 1

The Time Traveler’s Wife – Season 1

Gordita Chronicles – Season 1

Love Life – Seasons 1 2

Made for Love – Seasons 1 2

The Garcias – Season 1

Minx – Seasons 1 2

HBO Max initially renewed Minx for Season 2. Production was nearly complete when the network reversed its decision canceling the show instead. Lionsgate allowed the show to wrap filming and could potentially shop it to other TV homes that would want to continue the series beyond Season 2.

HBO Max and Discovery+ Merging Tentatively Called “Max”

In addition to big changes to the HBO Max and Discovery+ catalogues WBD is reportedly considering dropping HBO from HBO Max and Discovery+ become a combined platform in the spring calling the newly combined services “Max” instead. The decision is still being debated. In the interim executives at WBD have reportedly been calling it “BEAM” per CNBC.

Ad-Supported Tiers on Netflix Disney+

Netflix and Disney+ both launched its first ad-supported tiers in 2022 (Netflix in November Disney+ in December) joining Hulu Peacock Sling Paramount+ HBO Max and Pluto TV which have had ad-tier options for years.

With the releases happening so late in 2022 more people will likely opt to downsize to the ad-supported tiers in the new year. In the U.S. the Netflix ad-supported tier costs $6.99/month. Disney+‘s ad tier costs $7.99/month.

Live Shows on Streaming Services

Dancing With the Stars Season 31 was the first-ever live reality competition series exclusively airing on a streaming service. Season 32 will also likely be live on Disney+ but it could be interrupted with ads this time around unlike Season 31.

Netflix’s first-ever live TV event will be a comedy special starring Chris Rock in early 2023. Streaming services like Paramount+ and Peacock are already the streaming home for live shows such as Saturday Night Live and awards shows like the Grammys and Emmys.

Netflix Account Sharing Crackdown

Netflix’s new account sharing rules will take effect in 2023. The exact date is still to be announced but it will soon cost a couple of dollars for a primary Netflix account holder to let someone outside of their “Netflix Household.” It’s not clear if the charge will be one-time or monthly.

Showtime App Content Merging Onto Paramount+

Earlier this year Paramount Network briefly offered a Paramount+ and Showtime bundle that existed solely on the Paramount+ as opposed to past bundle offers that provided a grouped price for both while still requiring viewers to use the two separate apps. The offer ended in October.

In December Paramount Global CEO Bob Bakish hinted the Showtime app could be shuttered altogether its catalogue being merged onto Paramount+ permanently. Could Showtime as a network cease to exist in the future?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlaGsuY29tL2VuL2FydGljbGUvY2VsZWJyaXR5L2NvbmFuLWdyYXktc2tpcnRzLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Did Anyone Wear A Skirt Better Than Conan Gray This Year?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlaGsuY29tL2VuL2FydGljbGUvY2VsZWJyaXR5L2NvbmFuLWdyYXktc2tpcnRzLTIwMjIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021223AC3520>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

According to Adroit Market Research the financial technology (fintech) market is expected to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 20% through 2030 reaching $700 billion compared with $100 billion now. Multiple third-party research groups similarly project high growth for fintech in coming years which is good reason for investors to consider PayPal Holdings (PYPL -2.36%) and Block (SQ -2.58%).

Let's look at which one is the better stock for 2023 and beyond. My answer might surprise you.

1. PayPal stock has never been this cheap

PayPal is a pioneer in the fintech space. And with 432 million active accounts it's also one of the biggest players.

Over the last four quarters PayPal has generated nearly $5.7 billion in free cash flow (FCF) which is one way to measure profitability. Trading with a current market capitalization of $78 billion this means it trades at just 14 times trailing FCF -- the cheapest it's been since it was spun out from eBay in 2015. But more context unlocks the truly impressive value proposition for PayPal investors today.

In recent years PayPal management has focused on expanding its business into ancillary financial-technology services with limited success. And unfortunately this has held back FCF a bit lately as the chart below shows. However with a renewed focus on its core strengths PayPal is starting to live up to its full potential for FCF generation and I expect it to continue to improve and for its valuation to look all the more attractive.

Shareholders have already been told about PayPal's game plan for 2023. In the conference call to discuss financial results for the third quarter of 2022 PayPal Chief Financial Officer Gabrielle Rabinovitch said ""Returning capital to our shareholders continues to be our single biggest priority from a capital allocation standpoint and I think it will continue to be.""

So far in 2022 PayPal has spent nearly $1 billion per quarter on share repurchases and expects to maintain a comparable pace in 2023. This equates to more than 1% of shares outstanding per quarter.

PayPal isn't a high-growth opportunity like it once was -- it's only forecasting 7% year-over-year revenue growth in the current quarter. And it's only grown year-to-date revenue by 9% from the comparable period of 2021. However with consistent share buybacks it's possible for PayPal to increase revenue per share by a double-digit percentage which should be enough to beat the market in 2023 and beyond.

2. Block stock is inexpensive as well with a catch

In contrast to PayPal Block is still a higher-growth opportunity mostly thanks to its Cash App ecosystem. With Cash App users can invest transfer money to other Cash App users and more. They can also do more traditional banking things like direct deposit their paychecks and get a debit card.

The Cash App Card is important fuel on Block's fire. In the third quarter of 2022 cardholders reached 18 million and accounted for half of all cash inflows into the business. This is important. Once money is in the system it's highly likely users will stay and use the money inside of the ecosystem.

Block's management focuses on gross profit. It's not a perfect valuation metric. But let's look at it from this perspective for the sake of argument since this is management's emphasis.

Block has $5.5 billion in trailing-12-month gross profit and has a market cap of $36.2 billion. This valuation of a little less than 7 times its gross profit is historically a cheap valuation for this company. And its gross profit is still growing fast up roughly 34% through the first three quarters of 2022 compared to the comparable period of 2021. Steady growth in the Cash App ecosystem is fueling these gains.

As mentioned Block is higher-growth than PayPal and I believe Cash App has plenty more room from here. Moreover from certain perspectives Block looks like a cheap stock. However Block does have more uncertainty than PayPal -- in 2023 it will keep funneling money into projects like music platform Tidal and cryptocurrency which both have uncertain payoffs.

Here's another problem: After acquiring buy now pay later company Afterpay Block has an astounding $11.6 billion of goodwill on its balance sheet. Considering Block acquired Afterpay at a time when valuations were running hot it's very likely it will need to write off some of this goodwill in 2023 resulting in a big hit to profitability. It'll be a noncash charge but the market is sure not to like it.

For everything discussed here I would say that PayPal stock and Block stock are both great opportunities for 2023 and beyond but for different sets of investors. If you're an investor who wants respectable upside with limited downside risk I'd suggest buying PayPal. However if you're willing to take on more uncertainty for a stock with more upside potential Block might be the stock for you.

You may not have expected an answer like this. But this is often true of investing: The better investing opportunity sometimes comes down to your personal situation as is the case with PayPal and Block in my opinion.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Beijing will begin distributing Pfizer’s Covid-19 drug Paxlovid to the city’s community health centers in the coming days state media reported Monday.

The report comes as the city grapples with an unprecedented wave of infections that has severely strained its hospitals and emptied pharmacy shelves.

The state-run China News Service reported Monday that after receiving training community doctors will administer the medicine to Covid-19 patients and give instructions on how to use them.

“We have received the notice from officials but it is not clear when the drugs will arrive” it cited a worker at a local community health center in Beijing’s Xicheng district as saying.

Paxlovid remains the only foreign medicine to treat Covid that has been approved by China’s regulator for nationwide use but access is extremely difficult to come by. When a Chinese healthcare platform offered the antiviral drug earlier this month it sold out within hours.

Azvudine an oral medicine developed by China’s Genuine Biotech has also been approved.

After nearly three years of lockdowns quarantines and mass testing China abruptly abandoned its zero-Covid policy this month following nationwide protests over its heavy economic and social toll.

The abrupt change in policy has sparked panic buying of fever and cold medicines leading to widespread shortages both at pharmacies and on online shopping platforms. Long lines have become routine outside fever clinics and hospital wards overflowing with patients in the capital Beijing and elsewhere in the country.

On Monday Chinese state media CCTV quoted President Xi Jinping as saying the country needed a more targeted health strategy to protect people’s lives as the Covid situation in China changes.

“Xi Jinping emphasized that our country is currently facing a new Covid outbreak situation and new responsibilities we need to conduct our patriotic health movement in a more targeted manner” the CCTV report said.

It was one of the first public statements made by Xi about China’s Covid situation since the government’s decision to ease its strict restrictions.

An emergency room doctor in Beijing told the state-run People’s Daily on Thursday that four doctors on his shift did not have time to eat or drink. “We have been seeing patients nonstop” he said.

Another emergency room doctor told the newspaper he had been working despite having developed fever symptoms. “The number of patients is high and with fewer medical staff the pressure is multiplied” said the doctor.

In a sign of the strain on Beijing’s medical system hundreds of health professionals from across China have traveled to the city to assist medical centers.

As the capital Beijing has some of the best medical resources in the country. However the abrupt zero-Covid u-turn has left people and health facilities ill-prepared to deal with a surge in infections.

China’s official Covid case count has become meaningless after it rolled back mass testing and allowed residents to use antigen tests and isolate at home. It has stopped reporting asymptomatic cases conceding it was no longer possible to track the actual number of infections.

According to an internal estimate from the National Health Commission almost 250 million people in China have caught Covid in the first 20 days of December – accounting for roughly 18% of the country’s population.

Experts have warned that as people in big cities return to their hometowns for the Lunar New Year next month the virus could sweep through China’s vast rural areas where vaccination rates are lower and medical resources are severely lacking.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmRpYS9oZXRlcm8tZW1lcmdlcy0xc3QtaW4td29ybGQtdG8tYmFnLXdoby1wcS1mb3ItZ2VuZXJpYy12ZXJzaW9uLW9mLXBmaXplcnMtY292aWQtMTktb3JhbC1kcnVnLXBheGxvdmlkL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk2NTEyNjIwLmNtc9IBqwFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmRpYS9oZXRlcm8tZW1lcmdlcy0xc3QtaW4td29ybGQtdG8tYmFnLXdoby1wcS1mb3ItZ2VuZXJpYy12ZXJzaW9uLW9mLXBmaXplcnMtY292aWQtMTktb3JhbC1kcnVnLXBheGxvdmlkL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjUxMjYyMC5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hetero emerges 1st in world to bag WHO PQ for generic version of Pfizer's Covid-19 oral drug Paxlovid,HYDERABAD: Pharma player Hetero Group on Monday said it has emerged as the first in the world to receive the World Health Organisation 's prequalification of medicines programme (WHO-PQ) for its generic version of Covid-19 oral antiviral treatment candidate Nirmatrelvir  which along with Ritonavir is used as part of Pfizer ’s Paxlovid .Also See: Coronavirus Live Updates “This is the first prequalification for a generic version of Pfizer’s Covid-19 oral antiviral drug Paxlovid which the WHO called the best therapeutic choice for high-risk patients to date” Hetero said.The company said it will be rolling out its generic combi-pack under the NIRMACOM brand that will contain 150mg tablets of Nirmatrelvir and 100mg tablets of Ritonavir.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned +5.8% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.2% change. During this period the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry which P&G falls in has gained 6.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price investors tend to buy the stock resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter P&G is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share indicating no change from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.55 points to a change of +11% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days this estimate has changed +1.6%.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $6.97 indicates a change of +6.3% from what P&G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.3%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates P&G is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of P&G the consensus sales estimate of $20.81 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +1.3%. The $84.32 billion and $87.18 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.8% and +3.4% respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

P&G reported revenues of $20.2 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.52 for the same period compares with $1.37 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.48 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.41%. The EPS surprise was +7.04%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

P&G is graded D on this front indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&G. However its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

It’s too early to know how or if the 19-month-long strike connects with this lawsuit filed Wednesday in Lucas County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court by Allan Block of Toledo Ohio. He’s the CEO of Block Communications Inc. which owns the PG its Toledo sister paper The Blade as well as Pittsburgh City Paper and other businesses including cable companies and TV stations. His suit accuses others in his family of scheming to sell all of it without his input.

The suit doesn’t mention the PG strike. Zack Tanner president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh one of the unions that walked out in October 2022 said the lawsuit has no impact on the strike.

“The Blocks are no strangers to infighting” Tanner said on Thursday. “If you worked at the paper for a minute or for 50 years you know the Blocks like to fight with each other. No big news there. But our fight is our fight. They can fight internally but we’re still committed to winning the strike.”

Tanner said he remains confident the striking unions will prevail. A National Labor Relations Board judge has ruled strongly in the strikers’ favor he noted and the NLRB’s regional office recently took the unusual step of signaling its intent to seek an injunction that could bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and compel the company to bargain in good faith a new one.

“We’ll have our day in court and we will win the strike” Tanner said “no matter whether the Blocks are fighting with each other.”

In the suit Allan Block seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent BCI from being sold by his brother Pittsburgh’s John R. Block and others who run the company several of whom also live in the Pittsburgh area.

The motion says John Block — the publisher and editor-in-chief of the two newspapers — several times has tried and failed to replace the plaintiff Allan Block as CEO a position he is contracted to hold until 2028. “Now in a last-ditch effort to assert his so-called ‘sovereignty’ John Block has conspired with the rest of the Director Defendants to exclude Plaintiff from the most major decision to ever face BCI in its over 100 years of existence: a full sale of all its assets.”

The privately-held BCI started in 1901 by the Block brothers’ grandfather Paul Block is not currently for sale but the motion says that in January John Block “caused BCI to form a strategic transaction committee to pursue a merger or acquisition of the company.” That committee the suit says excluded Allan Block.

That news and the possibility raised in the motion that this committee making a “rushed and haphazard” sale “will result in significant job losses” was concerning to people who are working for those businesses as well as those who are on strike especially at a time when newspapers specifically and media in generally are struggling.

The Block family’s struggle for control of BCI looks to play out in court as does the strikers’ struggle for a contract.

The motion confirms that Allan and John Block each have a 25% stake in BCI while the other 50% is owned by family trusts that benefit family members.

Listed as defendants in the suit in addition to BCE and John Block are William Block Jr. exempt and non-exempt trusts Donald G. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Karen D. Johnese exempt and non-exempt trusts Barbara L. Block exempt and non-exempt trusts Block Family trust No. 2 Karen Johnese Diana Block Ron Davenport Nancy Reid and Emily Escalante.

Donald Block who lives in Fox Chapel in February was named president of Pittsburgh City Paper after it was purchased by a BCI subsidiary.

Meanwhile workers in four production unions went on strike at the Post-Gazette in October 2022 over a dispute that left them without health care coverage. Journalists in the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh joined them later in their own unfair labor practices strike which is now in its 19th month. The Guild’s issues go back farther than that in that the union’s last contract expired in 2017 and in 2020 the PG citing an impasse in contract bargaining imposed conditions including a company health plan on the workers.

In April the striking journalists learned that the regional office of the National Labor Relations Board had received approval from the NLRB to seek an injunction in their case in which a NLRB administrative law judge had in January 2023 ruled strongly in favor of the union. The judge ruled that the company had to bring the strikers back to work under their last contract and bargain a new one. The company appealed that decision and the appeal has yet to be heard by the NLRB. The union is expecting the regional NLRB office to file the injunction — called a 10(j) injunction — any day now but until it is doesn’t know the scope of what the NLRB wants a judge to order.

It’s a complicated situation and one with many moving and not moving parts.

Also in April one union the distribution workers ended its strike with the PG agreeing to do so and dissolve their union in exchange for severance payments.

The remaining unions still on strike have stressed that the Post-Gazette could settle with them at any time. The most recent actual bargaining sessions that the Pittsburgh Union Progress knows about and attended were in September of 2023. (One union met with company representatives in February to set bargaining dates but the Union Progress doesn’t know if any subsequent sessions happened.)

The Blocks’ commitment to the Post-Gazette is unclear though John Block said on Wednesday in a statement to The Blade that he remains “committed” to the PG as well as The Blade.

In a brief statement given to The Blade and other outlets a representative of Allan Block seemed to contradict that writing “It is unfortunate that certain Block family members would choose to further enrich themselves at the expense of local jobs and the communities that depend on local news coverage.”

Phone calls and messages from the Pittsburgh Union Progress to Allan Block John Block and Donald Block seeking interviews or comments about the lawsuit and the strike were not returned.

A small contingent of striking journalists went to John Block’s home on Wednesday and he was not home so a small group returned on Thursday evening. A man who answered the door said Block was not home and that the group could try again Friday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpbmNpbm5hdGkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAyNC8wNS8wOS9wZy1zaXR0ZW5mZWxkLWFwcGVhbHMtYnJpYmVyeS1leHRvcnRpb24tY29udmljdGlvbnMvNzM2MjY1NjAwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PG Sittenfeld appeal: What's criminal when it comes to campaign contributions?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.usatoday.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /.cam/sso?lookup=vault1&local=XPdQnn%2FgP0GmDS9H8y2UX%2BKiMeeKw6D%2BqVgOUIEQGkx8T%2BWWcPtVwH%2FYsV6smDtuAJblZOaBypKJQB6%2BnSihp1rY8xmJNN6g%2FpMT9qYw0Sjog2UkOzKu92ze3%2BW422o9mxEd1sDQED7d7Tdt3NwLQ2K%2FyTDcbxoxhLmNQSU9FdNCS%2BttRpqmwdDJoaYTb7hA9UF21v8prgMLHpwSYwGcXQ%3D%3D (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021224F04FA0>, 'Connection to www.usatoday.com timed out.

Sittenfeld corruption case: Federal appeals court hears arguments Thursday,"CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Attorneys for former Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld returned to a federal courtroom Thursday to try to overturn his convictions for bribery and attempted extortion.

A three-judge panel with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from his attorneys and then federal prosecutors.

No decision is expected anytime soon.

Sittenfeld 39 of East Walnut Hills is one of three former Cincinnati council members arrested in 2020 and convicted on federal public corruption charges in a series of cases federal authorities launched in 2017.

At the time of his arrest Sittenfeld was the front-runner in the mayor’s race and repeatedly received the most votes in city council elections.

Sittenfeld rejected a plea deal before his trial that would have limited his punishment if found guilty from probation only to two years or less in prison court records show.

The jury did find him not guilty on four of the six total charges. Those were two counts of honest services wire fraud and one count each of bribery and extortion.

Last year U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Cole rejected Sittenfeld’s request to throw out his convictions and get a new trial.

Sittenfeld failed to present “any persuasive arguments” supporting either motion the judge wrote in his 26-page order.

Judge Cole sentenced Sittenfeld to 16 months in prison and one year of supervised release once he’s out.

In early January Sittenfeld reported to a prison in northeastern Kentucky. Federal Correction Institution of Ashland is a minimum-security prison about 2.5 hours away from Cincinnati.

It was listed as one of America’s “10 Cushiest Prisons” by Forbes magazine.

Federal prosecutors say Sittenfeld promised to support perform “official acts” and “deliver the votes” to help the development of a property with sports betting at 435 Elm Street across from the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati in exchange for $20000 in donations to his political action fund (PAC) federal court records show.

His indictment alleged he solicited the money in exchange for his support to develop the Elm Street property which former Cincinnati Bengals player turned developer Chinedum Ndukwe envisioned as a hotel and office complex with apartments and a restaurant.

“This was not a single event one-off deal or momentary lapse in judgment” federal prosecutors wrote in his sentencing memo.

“Sittenfeld’s actions were part of a broader strategy to use his position of power within local government and his prospects for higher office to extract financial contributions out of individuals who regularly conducted city business. In doing so Sittenfeld made clear that his support for their city business was tied directly to their contributions to him. This is not faithful public service or even “politics as usual”—this is corruption.”

Sittenfeld’s federal trial attorneys however have repeatedly said that his indictment actually proved he did not commit a “quid pro quo.”

He has always been pro-development they noted contending his actions (raising money for future campaigns) are all perfectly legal and this is typical business conducted by politicians.

Sittenfeld’s lead appellate attorneys are Yaakov Roth and James Burnham.

Burnham is a Washington D.C. attorney considered an expert in federal corruption law because he successfully represented former Virginia Governor Robert F. McDonnell in McDonnell v. United States.

That case was a major challenge to the scope of the Federal corruption laws because the 2016 ruling narrowed the legal definition of public corruption and made it harder for prosecutors to prove that a political official engaged in bribery.

In 2017 then-President Donald Trump appointed Burnham as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Counsel to the President.

Now in Sittenfeld’s appeal Burnham and Roth argue that federal prosecutors didn’t show clear and precise proof of corruption the “quid pro quo.”

If Sittenfeld’s convictions are allowed to stand it would bring “a First Amendment Ice Age” where every politician could face prosecution for fundraising according to his appeal.

“The government engineered a sting to see if (Sittenfeld) would accept a campaign donation in exchange for supporting a local development project. To maximize the sting’s chances of success the FBI approached Sittenfeld through one of his longtime existing donors in connection with a project Sittenfeld had already agreed to support” his appeal states.

“Yet despite the choreography Sittenfeld never bit. Over the course of a year-long prosecutorial Truman Show Sittenfeld rejected the only express quid pro quo his friend offered cautioned him on the legal limits around donations turned away contributions that did not comport with obscure campaign-finance rules and even invited two undercover agents to a dinner party with the U.S. Attorney.”

Several amicus briefs also have been filed in support of Sittenfeld’s appeal

Among them are ones from former U.S. Attorney Generals William Barr and John Ashcroft and the top federal prosecutor for the same government office who prosecuted Sittenfeld Carter Stewart. He was the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio from 2009 to 2016.

Sittenfeld’s case they wrote “has two highly unusual features that render it an extreme outlier among campaign-finance bribery prosecutions. First Mr. Sittenfeld’s conduct did not involve the typical signs of wrongdoing that prosecutors expect to see when a public official is engaged in a corrupt enterprise…

“Second the case resulted from a two-year investigation that involved a sting operation specifically intended to uncover evidence of misconduct…The result was a conviction for conduct that was not criminal.”

The Little Rock School District's second new high school building in a decade is in the planning stages in regard to its academic programming and physical attributes.

The new West High School building is scheduled to open for the 2025-26 school year on land with a small lake that is to the immediate east of Pinnacle View Middle School 5619 Ranch Drive in the northwest part of the district.

The new high school building is one of the projects being funded with the proceeds from a Nov. 2 2021 voter-approved 12.4-mill property tax rate extension.

Other district projects similarly funded are the construction -- now underway -- of the new Dr. Marian G. Lacey Academy for kindergarten-through-eighth grades on Geyer Springs Road and the replacement of decades-old portable classrooms with permanent classrooms at the historic Central High.

Preliminary plans for West High call for a three-story building with an arena and performing arts space to serve some 1200 students Kevin Yarberry the district's director of maintenance and operations said recently. Lewis Architects Engineers are the designers.

The district-owned land includes a pond that is roughly the size of a football stadium. Some in the district have looked at the pond and see an opportunity for a wetlands study program or for ""aqua lab/marine technology"" as it is labeled on preliminary building plans.

Others who responded to an initial survey about the school warned that the pond could be a danger and subject the district to liability should there be accidents.

Yarberry said with a laugh that he is not currently in the aqua-lab camp.

""Do I think it would be valuable space for a field house or additional practice field or soccer field? Yes I do"" he said.

""That's where I see the value right now without understanding what the curriculum looks like. I'm not sure how the pond would relate.""

Plans are not yet firm but the new school building is to be a traditional high school that may incorporate the elements of the already existing West High School of Innovation. West High School of Innovation opened in the 2019-20 school year under the direction of the Arkansas Board of Education. That was at a time when the Little Rock district operated under state control.

The School of Innovation offers flexible scheduling with on-site and online instruction that is centered on project-based learning. The school also has two fledgling ""career academies"" -- one focused on animal and plant systems and advanced professional studies and the other an academy of digital marketing design and logistics.

The new high school building is also to house ""career academies"" which are being established in high schools throughout Pulaski County to provide students with opportunities to learn core academics in the context of particular occupations. Some schools are expected to have wall-to-wall academies meaning that all students will be enrolled in them. Pocket academies are another option in which students don't have to be part of a career academy but choose that option.

The selection of career academies and whether they will be wall-to-wall or pocket academies are among the decisions to be made for the new high school building.

About 82% of 511 responders to an initial district survey about the new school building indicated a preference for academy themes focused on business and finance architecture and design and medical and biotechnology Shay Loring the district's director of secondary education said. Slightly less popular were academies on urban agriculture digital design and medical systems and technology.

Within each academy there are multiple career ""pathways."" Students would choose an academy then choose a more specific career pathway within the academy and then take at least three courses within the pathway in the time they are in 10th through 12th grades.

Each pathway offers opportunities for students to shadow in different career fields take tours and serve as job interns Shameka Montgomery the district's director of career and technical education said.

Ninth-graders take a freshman seminar course that introduces them to the academies and pathways.

The West High School of Innovation for grades nine through 12 is now housed in what was a multistory office building that served as the headquarters for a long-gone company that published materials on handcrafts.

With the construction of new school space the original office building could become home to ninth-graders Yarberry said.

""It's a logical option to house freshmen in the original building"" Yarberry said.

The spaces for freshmen and for the older students could be separated by some shared common areas such as the school cafeteria.

Loring the district's director of secondary schools has said that 74% of the respondents to an initial parent survey about the school plans indicated a preference for giving freshman some separation from older students in the high school.

Melissa Gude the Little Rock district's chief academic officer highlighted some of the often mentioned preferences expressed by those who responded to the survey:

• Plenty of options for Advanced Placement and pre-Advanced Placement courses as well as languages such as Spanish Chinese French and Arabic.

• Art programs and art spaces comparable to athletic spaces.

• Unrivaled sports facilities.

• Personal finance training.

• Ample parking.

• Space for the school to expand or grow.

• A wide variety of safety features including cameras security staff safe rooms controlled entries and a filled-in pond.

• Use of natural light native plants walking trails rooftop gardens.

""Lots of these are being considered"" Gude said about the preferences identified in the first October/November survey particularly the separate space for ninth-graders.

A second survey is available to community members that asks about the academies and the school mascot. Those interested in that survey can access it using the QR code provided on the district's website under the ""Latest District News"" link to "" West High School community update.""

Yarberry said he anticipates that there will be decisions made about the West building and a guaranteed maximum price for it established by spring. The district has used $85 million as an estimated cost for the project.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tL3Nub3d5LXdlc3Rlcm5zLXRvLXdhdGNoLWJlZm9yZS13aW50ZXItZW5kcy1oYXRlZnVsLWVpZ2h0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tarantino to John Wayne: Wintry Western Movies to Watch Before Winter Ends,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vY29sbGlkZXIuY29tL3Nub3d5LXdlc3Rlcm5zLXRvLXdhdGNoLWJlZm9yZS13aW50ZXItZW5kcy1oYXRlZnVsLWVpZ2h0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1cm5hYnlub3cuY29tL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvdG9wLWJ1cm5hYnktbmV3cy1zdG9yaWVzLW9mLTIwMjItbm8tNi1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1pbi10aGUtY2l0eS02Mjg3NzU00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top stories of Burnaby 2022: Real estate development towers,"Burnaby could see the tallest tower in Western Canada built — and maybe even 'tiny' studio units under 350 sq. ft.

As 2022 draws to a close we’re looking back at the top 10 Burnaby news stories of the year.

Yesterday we spotlighted a story about of an emotional end to a standoff at a SkyTrain station which captured the imagination of many readers.

Today we recap the year’s number No. 6 story with a look at our coverage of rapid development in Burnaby.

Building building building in Burnaby

Highrise towers condos demovictions renters and unit sizes – for years now development has been a major sticking point in Burnaby. Here’s a rundown of some of our most-read development stories.

2022 was a busy year for the city’s planning department which has seen the approval of two urban villages in the Bainbridge and Lochdale neighbourhoods.

The urban villages are intended to “(bridge) the gap” between larger town centres like Metrotown and Brentwood and smaller-scale residential neighbourhoods.

The villages will see towers up to 25 storeys in some areas. The plans saw some opposition by residents in the Bainbridge area but were approved unanimously by council in July.

Individual projects have also garnered attention – particularly the 80-storey tower and 73-storey tower proposed for development beside Lougheed SkyTrain station at 9850 Austin Rd. 9858 Gatineau Pl. and 9898 Gatineau Pl.

The two towers totalling 1466 market strata units at 259 metres and 238.5 m respectively would be the tallest in Western Canada.

The project was opposed by now-retired councillor Colleen Jordan and residents at public hearing as the developer (which would usually be required to incorporate rental units in the towers) plans to demolish a rental building at 3846 Carrigan Crt. across Lougheed Highway and build a new tower with the rental units included on that lot. The development has a few more hoops to jump through before final approval.

Two separate Metrotown developments have also drawn criticism: a massive five-tower development at 4750 Kingsway includes 58 tiny non-market rental units less than 350 square feet in size.

Mayor Mike Hurley and Coun. Joe Keithley voted against the project which has yet to go to final approval. Keithley said “It’s like living your entire existence in a super tiny hotel room.”

Just blocks away at 6031 Wilson Ave. a development with what a resident called a “poor door” and “segregated amenities” is nearing approval. The project has two separate entrances for strata condo owners and renters and has separated amenities for renters and owners.

Meanwhile the Brentwood area saw four master plans approved with little fanfare though the plans account for about 8100 new housing units. Grosvenor Brentwood South Yards Bassano and Brentwood West will bring 19 highrise towers between 30 and 64 storeys to the area.

What will next year bring? With a pro-development council elected it’s likely more towers and more housing will be approved. Council’s planning and development committee recently heard a report on a master plan for Plaza 5000 Metrotown with three towers about 50 storeys high and that’s just the start.",,,,,,

Check out the top sales,"2022 was a lucrative year for commercial real estate in the Tampa Bay area. The Tampa Bay Times reviewed property records from Hillsborough Pinellas and Pasco counties and found that the 20 highest grossing sales brought in a cumulative total of more than $2 billion.

“Transactions coming in over $100 million dollars 10 years ago that’s not something we’d be talking about” said Danny Rice a market leader overseeing the Central Florida market for real estate firm Collier’s. “It really speaks volumes to where Tampa has matured to.”

Heavy in-migration strong rent growth and a strong job market made the region a prime destination for investors looking to turn a profit. Apartments and multi-family properties were a hot commodity.

The first half of the year was busy. Zach Nolan managing director of JLL Capital Markets in Tampa said 2021 was a record year for sales volume and 2022 was on pace to exceed that.

But by the third quarter the market began to cool.

“With inflation concerns and interest rates going up that really started a pull back from a lot of investors who were just uncertain of where the market was heading” Nolan said.

That trend is likely to carry through to 2023. Still investors remain bullish on Tampa Bay in the long term as property values continue to grow.

The KMC intends to start swimming activities right from April 1 2023 when the swimming season kicks off in the city. ""The natural waterbody at Deshbandhu Park has been refurbished thoroughly and has been converted into a swimming pool of international standards. State competitions as well as national competitions can be hosted in this swimming pool. There are all sorts of modern facilities like filtration plant changing room arrangements for a continuous source of water etc required for an international standard pool"" a senior official of KMC's Parks and Gardens department said.

There are five pools in the waterbody that includes three for novices one for practice and one main pool for holding competitions. The main pool is 50 by 25 metres the three for novices are 15 by 10 metres and another 25 by 15 metres for practice. The depth is 2 metres.

The pools for the training will be maintained by the three swimming clubs but for managing the one for hosting competitions an expert agency needs to be selected.

The work for the development of the pool had begun a long time back under the initiative of former MLA and minister Sadhan Pande. However Pande fell ill and passed away after suffering from a prolonged illness in February this year. During the period of his illness the work had come to a standstill.

However with local councillor of ward 12 Minakshi Ganguly taking up the matter with the KMC the work for developing the pool has now been completed. The total cost involved has been to the tune of Rs 5 crore.

It is learnt that KMC had earlier written to the Sports Authority of India (SAI) to run the pool on a lease basis but the latter had informed that they too have a swimming infrastructure of international standards and hence cannot provide additional machinery for this pool.

""We will rope in an agency for running and maintenance of the pool and an EOI for the same will soon be floated"" the official added.",,,,,,,,,

Losses leakages receivables supply quality and discontinuities and now the rising circular debt for which DISCOs are only partly responsible.

Many options have been examined and pursued of which two are the most common and widely debated; privatisation and provincialisation. Provincialisation and privatisation need not be mutually exclusive as we will discuss later. And there is electricity market (CTBCM) which may result in partial privatisation by way of taking away electricity marketing and selling. We will examine the issues and prospects involved in each option.

In the electricity sector power DISCOs are the remaining entities which are the subject of policy discussion for some kind of offloading from the federal government. There is a circular debt of around Rs3 trillion which belongs to the power sector and mostly lodged in the accounts of DISCOs.

High generation cost and unpaid subsidies may not be exactly ascribed to DISCOs. High fuel cost has been a recent phenomenon wherein gas and coal prices tripled causing uncollected receivables close-outs and increased theft; and then macroeconomic problems like current account deficit (CAD) currency depreciation and general inflation. Finally Covid followed by floods. This is coupled with IMF and other IFIs dementia which fail to recognise these issues and insist on increase in tariff a subject that merits discussion some time later.

Privatisation background

There has been a long experience of privatisation. Public sector industries have been mostly privatised; some are running successfully and some have closed down for a variety of reasons.

Financing the annual losses and deficits has been a major issue of the SOE which was largely reduced. Some still remain like PIA and Pakistan Steel which have to be financed from government kitty almost yearly with no end in sight. In energy sector privatisation has not happened although government shares have been reduced in some companies. The problem with energy sector is that these are mostly monopolies or near-monopolies and are typically large companies.

Some companies have been and continue to be profitable and have been financing energy sector deficit like circular debt. OGDCL PPL and PSO are successful examples. Although OGDCL and PPL are profitable there are performance issues and their falling oil and gas resources have made their prospects of survival questionable. Gas DISCOs have almost the same problems as power DISCOs have.

Component of private sector has become significant due to the introduction of IPPs. Hydro and nuclear remain in public sector while most of the other power generation is under private sector IPPs. There are some power generation companies in public sector (GENCOs) which are slated to close down eventually one after the other. Private sector (IPPs) has an installed base of 18750MW.

Privatisation issues

Why hasn’t privatisation succeeded or even implemented in the power sector? There are many possible reasons for it.

Firstly DISCOs are a monopoly involving complex financial transactions. Electricity prices are not determined by the market. Prices have to be subsidised for the low-income group and even for export subsidies.

Accounting for these subsidies and losses in transferring and continuing with these is indeed complicated and makes both government (the seller) and private sector (the buyer) unsure of the viability and the risks involved.

KE was privatised in a highly fluid framework when almost nobody was prepared to take it over. IFIs pushed the privatisation process. Secondly DISCOs are large companies financially and geographically. There aren’t many parties in Pakistan which have the financial and organisational capacity and capability to buy and run these organisations.

If there are a few one would be diverting them from doing much useful work in other sectors. Look at PTCL. It was taken over by UAE government-owned Etisalat. Some of the large banks have been taken over by NGOs or foundations. Thirdly there are risks in selling DISCOs to foreign enterprises due to special problems involved in DISCO business. There is widespread theft in which rich and powerful are involved.

A foreign company in loss may resort to international courts due to these issues. What has happened in the case of Karkey and Reko Diq.

Local partners may also indulge in some questionable and unacceptable practices which are not unthinkable for the private sector in this country. Money laundering and double book-keeping is rampant which can create complications of international dimensions. Many internationally reputed companies are not interested to come to Pakistan. Thus there are risks on both sides.

Fourthly stability and sustainability of government policy is yet another risk and unknown. Pakistan is a poor and developing country where political and ideological issues haven’t yet been sorted out with a broad consensus. This creates differences and disagreement in business transactions. Chinese have recently demanded withdrawal of Mohammad Ali Report; the latter report pointed out some accounting inadequacies in CPEC power projects.

Power generation is much simpler business than DISCOs. The opportunities of contract disputes are many as indicated earlier. This may cause cracks with major international friends.

Fifthly a new policy issue and complication has emerged that is of CTBCM. DISCOs are to be reduced to wire-only business. Under CTBCM there is an open access wheeling policy under which the current DISCO management argues cost allocation has not been done properly. They have gone to court.

CTBCM is in limbo but has to be implemented under Nepra law.

Sixthly public is not satisfied with the privatisation of KE which is the only example of DISCO privatisation. This is not the place here to go into the controversial issue of KE performance.

Excessive load-shedding in Karachi has annoyed both residential and industrial customers. Would new parties into the DISCO privatisation process be any different? They may have the same or even more management capital and ownership issues. This makes provincial governments rather unsure of supporting DISCO privatisation.

Seventhly there are financial issues of payables and receivables and accumulated losses. Valuation issues are not simple; there are risks and uncertainties of all kind. Some propose selling DISCOs in one rupee.

Eighthly there is a labour union issue. Pakistan’s private sector employers do not have very good standing with labour and employees. Their scepticism is not misplaced either.

Unions oppose privatisation. No practical formula has yet been available to deal with the labour union’s opposition.

Among ultra-high-net-worth individuals — who are characterized as having more than $10 million in investable assets with preferences for receiving specialized lending business banking succession planning and concierge services from a single source — that trend is even more prevalent (89%).

Many high-net-worth investors told us they’re interested in receiving “wealth management adjacent” services — including tax planning trust and estate planning and health or elder care services — from their primary advisors. But many respondents also shared that their primary advisors don’t offer those services.

Firms should also anticipate and assess client servicing needs across key high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth personas including entrepreneurs business owners and legacy beneficiaries. In our survey 41% of respondents noted their primary source of investable assets stemmed from income from business ownership or sale of a business while 33% indicated that the source had been inheritance or trust. Though the makeup of each client base varies firms should consider including business succession and multi-generational family planning as part of their offering as these services appear to be in high demand among this key demographic.

Additionally just over half (51%) of the high-net-worth respondents indicated they hold restricted stock units (RSUs) and/or stock options from their employer. Equity compensation planning is increasingly a key differentiator for high-net-worth investors with awards especially for a growing contingent of “new tech money” which could provide firms a significant opportunity to capture investors in the accumulation phase of their careers.

The Budget is expected to give a big push to capital expenditure but Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is confident that the buoyancy in tax collections in 2022-23 can fund the additional spending . Gross tax revenue collections in the first half of the year (April-September) were up 18% compared to the previous year.At the same time the financial services industry investors and taxpayers are seeking more tax deductions and lower tax rates . “Health insurance is not just a risk mitigation tool but also helps in overall economic development by spreading protection across a larger population. The deduction under Section 80D should be raised from the current Rs.25000 to Rs.1 lakh” says Tapan Singhel Managing Director & CEO Bajaj Allianz General Insurance. “Pension and annuity income should be made tax-free in the hands of policyholders or a deduction for the principal component should be allowed” says Satishwar B Managing Director & CEOAegon Life Insurance Though it will be difficult for the government to give out so many tax sops ET Wealth believes there are some areas that need fixing. For instance the Rs.1.5 lakh deduction limit under Section 80C was last revised more than eight years ago in 2014. Since then the cost inflation index has risen by over 50% pushing up the sum required for future goals. For many Indians tax saving is a key driver of investments. But the stagnant Section 80C deduction limit means they have not seen any reason to save more.Current limit of Rs.1.5 lakh has been stagnant for last nine years.Experts feel there is a compelling case to hike the 80C limit. Though a new deduction for NPS contributions under Section 80(CCD1b) and a Rs.50000 standard deduction were added in recent years the deduction limit needs to be raised to at least Rs.2.5 lakh to provide some relief to taxpayers. A deduction of Rs.2.5 lakh will result in higher tax savings of up to Rs.78000 a year compared to Rs.46800 now. “The incentive for savings has to go up. Besides there are more instruments in the 80C basket today than there were a decade or so ago” says Vidya Bala Head – Research Primeinvestor.in.The prevailing tax regime for different assets is a complex web with multiple rates and different rules for various asset classes. For instance long term capital gains from listed stocks and equity funds are taxed at 10% without indexation after one year. But unlisted stocks and foreign equities are taxed differently—shares held for more than 24 months are considered long-term and taxed at 20% without indexation. Meanwhile gains from international equity funds qualify as long term only after three years and are taxed at 20% after indexation— the same as non-equity funds. But listed bonds are again treated differently from bond funds. Capital gains from listed bonds are regarded as long term if held for over one year and taxed at 20% without indexation.In gold gold ETFs and gold funds are taxed differently than sovereign gold bonds. In real estate also REITs are taxed differently from physical property. Experts say the budget should bring parity in tax rules. At the very basic level tax rates and holding period criteria within each asset class should be uniform. Taxation of high-value Ulips with annual premium of more than Rs.2.5 lakh (completely tax-free earlier) only partially brought them at par with listed stocks and equity funds last year. But Ulips still enjoy preferential treatment. Juzer Gabajiwala Director Ventura Securities questions “Why should a switch transaction in a mutual fund incur tax liability even as similar switch in Ulips is tax free?” More anomalies persist. Amol Joshi Founder PlanRupee Investment Services argues “Within asset classes wherever one product is given preferential tax treatment over another it may not be in investor’s interest.There are different rates and threshold periods for different assets.One should not have to deal with three different set of tax rules for the same vehicle.” However some say the disparity in tax rules is needed. “Even within asset classesthere is a variation in risk profile depending on the instrument. Maintaining that distinction with differentiated tax rules is apt” says Bala. Further some feel that tax rates across asset classes also need to reflect commonly accepted financial wisdom. For instance it is said that bond investments are best held for the short term and equities are ideal for the long term. But the holding period criterion for the two asset classes encourages quite the opposite. Joshi feels that the varied holding period thresholds (ranging from 1 2 and 3 years) should be done away with and a common holding period of say two years should be introduced across all asset classes.The tax on long term capital gains from equities introduced two years ago was long overdue. As is evident from the market mood it has not dampened the investors’ sentiment. Even so there is a need to give equities the benefit of indexation on long term capital gains. Indexation adjusts the purchase price of the asset for the inflation rate reducing the taxable gains and therefore the actual tax liability. The Rs.1 lakh exemption on long term gains from equities somewhat compensates equity investors but that only helps small investors. It is a better idea to bring in the indexation benefit and remove the exemption.Life insurance is a popular tax saving instrument because it is sold that way by insurance agents. But given the large crowd of options under Section 80C the industry wants a separate deduction for life insurance. “Our paramount interest has always been to insure more citizens and ensure they have sufficient coverage. Our efforts will be augmented if the government introduces a separate tax deduction limit exclusively for life insurance premiums” says Tarun Chugh Managing Director and CEO Bajaj Allianz Life.As mentioned earlier for many investors tax savings is the primary factor defining investment choices. A separate deduction will certainly push more people to buy insurance but this deduction should be only for pure protection term plans. Just like tax benefits under Section 10(10D) are available only if the cover is 10 times the annual premium the new deduction should be given only for policies where the cover is at least 200 times the annual premium. “A separate section for term policies would be helpful given the huge protection gap in the country” says Vighnesh Shahane MD & CEO Ageas Federal Life Insurance.Traditional plans have very high premiums and offer very low cover.“There should be a separate bucket for life insurance policies. A separate section for term insurance policies would be helpful given the huge protection gap in the country.”VIGHNESH SHAHANE MANAGING DIRECTOR & CEO AGEAS FEDERAL LIFE INSURANCEThe insurance industry also wants more tax benefits on pension products. High on the wishlist is something that has the potential to radically change the way annuity products are seen in India. “The pension premium is already paid through taxable income so pension should be made tax-free in the hands of the customer. This will increase the penetration of pension and make India a pensioned society especially since we don’t have any social security cover” says Shahane of Ageas Federal Life Insurance. “Pension and annuity income should be made tax-free in the hands of policyholders or a deduction for the principal component should be allowed” concurs Satishwar B.But making annuity tax free will burn a big hole in government finances. Instead a more feasible option would be to increase the deduction under Section 80CCD(1b) from Rs.50000 to Rs.1 lakh. The NPS has seen massive inflows since the new tax saving option was introduced in 2016. According to a Crisil study the AUM of the scheme has registered annual growth of 33.7% in the past five years. Insurance companies also want their pension plans to get the same tax benefits as the NPS. “There could be a separate bucket for pensions of Rs.50000-75000 to level the playing field with NPS” says Shahane.“Pension and annuity income should be made tax-free in the hands of policyholders or a deduction for the principal component should be allowed. This will encourage purchase of pension plans.”SATISHWAR B. MANAGING DIRECTOR & CEO AEGON LIFE INSURANCEThe surge in health insurance costs and the need for higher covers after the pandemic mean the current deduction limit of Rs.25000 under Section 80D is woefully inadequate. As per a LocalCircles survey between August 2021 and August 2022 among 10000 respondents nearly 38% saw a premium rise of over 50% in a year while 24% experienced a 25-50% increase. For senior citizens this amount almost doubled in a year.Besides the premium cost is higher in metros and tier 1 cities as is the cost of hospitalization which necessitates a higher cover. So while a cover of Rs.5-10 lakh would have been sufficient for an individual in a metro two years ago he will now need to have a Rs.15-20 lakh cover. “Increasing the limit to claim tax deductions under Section 80D will enhance affordability and encourage more people to opt for health insurance for their family and elderly parents” says Krishnan Ramachandran MD and CEO at Niva Bupa Health Insurance.“Health insurance helps in overall economic development. The deduction under Section 80D should be raised from the current Rs.25000 to Rs.1 lakh.”TAPAN SINGHEL MANAGING DIRECTOR & CEO BAJAJ ALLIANZ GENERAL INSURANCEReal estate is reviving leading to an increase in housing prices. This along with the possibility of an increase in interest rates of home loans is making it difficult for many people to buy a house. To give a boost to them especially first-time homebuyers the government should offer some tax sops. One way to do this is to increase the current tax rebate of Rs.2 lakh on home loan interest repayment under Section 24 to at least Rs.5 lakh.“Home loans are usually large loans as even a reasonably-priced house costs more than Rs.50 lakh. As almost two-third of your loan repayment goes towards paying off the interest in the first few years of the loan borrowers pay way more than Rs.2 lakh interest on loans every year. Enhancing the exemption to at least Rs.5 lakh can help to reduce the cost of purchase for home buyers” says Vivek Rathi Director Research Knight Frank India.The Budget should also consider revising the price bandwidths for homes to qualify as affordable housing. “A price band of Rs.45 lakh or below is far too low in a city like Mumbai where it should be increased to Rs.85 lakh or more. In other major cities the qualifying price band should be increased to Rs.60-65 lakh” says Anuj Puri Chairman Anarock. He suggests that the government can also give a push to affordable housing by giving higher rebates to home loans taken for houses that cost less than Rs.85 lakh. “The government can make a classification index and then assign an affordability section taking into account the differential in the average price in urban cities along with the cost of living there. This will be easy to implement and will give a boost to the mid-segment housing” says Samantak Das Chief Economist and ED Research and REIS JLL India.As property prices soar and loan amounts get bigger deduction of Rs.2 lakh on the interest is not enough.Here’s the math for a Rs.50 lakh loan at 9% for a borrower in 30% tax bracket.“Borrowers pay way more than Rs.2 lakh interest on home loans in a year. The deduction should be enhanced to Rs.5 lakh to give some relief to home buyers.”VIVEK RATHI DIRECTOR - RESEARCH KNIGHT FRANK INDIA,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vbWFya2V0L2FtYmFuaS1vci1hZGFuaS13aGljaC1idXNpbmVzcy1ncm91cC1wcm92aWRlZC10aGUtaGlnaGVzdC1yZXR1cm5zLXRvLXNoYXJlaG9sZGVycy1pbi0yMDIyLTE1MTY3MjAyMTMyNzIzMy5odG1s0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9tYXJrZXQvYW1iYW5pLW9yLWFkYW5pLXdoaWNoLWJ1c2luZXNzLWdyb3VwLXByb3ZpZGVkLXRoZS1oaWdoZXN0LXJldHVybnMtdG8tc2hhcmVob2xkZXJzLWluLTIwMjIvYW1wLTE1MTY3MjAyMTMyNzIzMy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 in Review | Ambani vs Adani: Whose stocks have rewarded investors most this year? | Mint,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.livemint.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /market/ambani-or-adani-which-business-group-provided-the-highest-returns-to-shareholders-in-2022-151672021327233.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021223BF3730>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vbWFya2V0L2FtYmFuaS1vci1hZGFuaS13aGljaC1idXNpbmVzcy1ncm91cC1wcm92aWRlZC10aGUtaGlnaGVzdC1yZXR1cm5zLXRvLXNoYXJlaG9sZGVycy1pbi0yMDIyLTE1MTY3MjAyMTMyNzIzMy5odG1s0gGSAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9tYXJrZXQvYW1iYW5pLW9yLWFkYW5pLXdoaWNoLWJ1c2luZXNzLWdyb3VwLXByb3ZpZGVkLXRoZS1oaWdoZXN0LXJldHVybnMtdG8tc2hhcmVob2xkZXJzLWluLTIwMjIvYW1wLTE1MTY3MjAyMTMyNzIzMy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8yNi9wbmItbWFpbnRhaW5zLXBydWRlbmNlLWluLWRpdmVyc2lmaWNhdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PNB maintains prudence in diversification,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbWFsYXlzaWFucmVzZXJ2ZS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8yNi9wbmItbWFpbnRhaW5zLXBydWRlbmNlLWluLWRpdmVyc2lmaWNhdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021226905750>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

This can include looking at what insurance you have for your car. If you moved or your auto policy no longer fits your needs or premiums are too high it’s time to consider shopping around.

This annual financial review might even include your car insurance policy. Does your current policy still suit your needs? Has the cost gone up beyond what you’ve budgeted for? Could you obtain a new policy that is less elsewhere?

Ensuring you’re getting the best deal for your money is not the only reason to shop for new quotes. You may also need to do so if you’ve experienced various life events.

When to shop for a new auto policy

There are some key times when you should consider requesting new auto policy quotes. They include when you move to a new location add a new driver to the policy and when you purchase a new vehicle. But these are just a few of the occasions when it can be a good idea to explore your options.

“The auto insurance market is highly competitive and consumers have a large variety of choices” says Pat Callahan president of personal lines for Progressive. “Because prices vary among insurers and rates change frequently it can be beneficial for consumers to shop at least once a year.”

When you move

When relocating from one state to another your insurance policy cannot simply transfer with you. Auto insurance laws vary from one state to another. Your policy and its premium are based on local laws and the specific coverage you’re required to carry.

But even moving from one city to another—or from one ZIP code to another within the same city—can be a reason to policy shop as local moves can trigger changes in your daily commute to work. Additional factors may also change and impact your policy costs such as local crime and accident rates.

“Even moving cities within the same state can have an effect on car insurance rates as premiums vary by ZIP code. Typically metropolitan areas have a high concentration of drivers and an increased likelihood of accidents making average insurance premiums higher” says Renata Balasco insurance expert and licensed agent at the insurance comparison platform The Zebra. “If you move from a major city to a smaller suburb or residential area—or vice versa—you may see your rates change due to differing traffic statistics.”

When adding a new driver

In most cases adding a new driver to a policy can result in higher premiums. This is because there’s now a higher probability of a claim particularly when you add a younger driver—meaning another reason you may want to shop around and ensure you’re getting the most competitive price possible.

“Teen drivers are the most expensive age demographic to insure as insurance companies see them as the least experienced on the road and the most likely to get into accidents” says Balasco. “Shopping around for a new policy when adding someone to it can allow you to browse any available discount opportunities that the new driver may qualify for; some common examples include a good student discount a driving course discount or a student away from home discount.”

When you get a new car

Naturally when purchasing a new vehicle you’ll want to ensure you have the proper coverage. The first step is to notify your current insurance carrier as you’re required to do in order to update your coverage. This process typically results in a new cost for the policy.

“The year make and model of the car you drive have a significant impact on your policy cost. Newer vehicles may have safety features that older cars lack but parts can be more expensive to replace if damaged” says Balasco.

If your current policy changes too much for the new vehicle consider obtaining some additional quotes elsewhere in order to find the best rate for your circumstances.

When your policy needs change

Beyond all of the specific examples already discussed your policy needs may evolve for other reasons as well. Perhaps you’re a remote worker now and in previous years you had a significant daily commute. The amount you drive impacts how much your insurance costs. If you drive less now you may be able to reduce the policy’s overall price.

Additionally if your car is getting older and you no longer feel the need to carry as much coverage as you once did. And you may also consider shopping for a new policy quote.

“Job changes starting or finishing school kids going to or coming home from college will all likely change your vehicle usage and insurance needs” says Callahan. “So it pays to contact your current agent or company and to potentially shop for new coverage if you aren’t satisfied with what they can offer you.”

When the policy no longer fits your budget

Of course you don’t need to have undergone major life changes in order to prompt the search for new policy quotes. In some cases you may simply want to do so because your premium has increased and you need to bring costs in line with your current budget needs—particularly at a time when inflation is pinching many household budgets.

“Car insurance rates are rising annually regardless of your driving profile” says Balasco. “If your premium has increased beyond your comfort level—or if you’ve been with a particular carrier for several years—it may be time to shop around. Another insurance company may be able to offer lower rates or different discount opportunities.”

4 tips for insurance shopping

As you set out to obtain new quotes remember that there are a variety of ways to cut costs on an auto insurance policy but you’ll want to make sure you’re still getting all of the coverage you need.

“It’s important to compare coverages against your current policy and not only look at price” advises Carmella Cange Liberty Mutual’s insurance manager of personal lines product design and experience global retail markets U.S. “Companies may be offering different coverages or limits on their quote which is often the cause for a price disparity. Customers should make sure they are comparing costs against similar policy terms.”

It’s also critical to read the fine print of a quote as some companies may be offering prices based on a six-month policy versus a 12-month policy to make the price appear cheaper.

Additional ways to shop around include:

Use online quote comparison tools: Online comparison platforms make it easy to look at your coverage options and price quotes all in one place. They can simplify the shopping process and save you time.

Online comparison platforms make it easy to look at your coverage options and price quotes all in one place. They can simplify the shopping process and save you time. Work with an independent insurance agency: When you work with an independent agency it will do the comparison shopping for you.

When you work with an independent agency it will do the comparison shopping for you. Bundle policies: If you’re looking for still more ways to save money it can also be a good idea to bundle your insurance policies. This means using one insurance carrier to provide your home renters car pet and life insurance—or whichever of those policies you require. Often bundling can earn you a multi-policy discount while also making it easier to manage all of your policies in one place.

The takeaway

Shopping around at least once a year for new car insurance can save you money and also help you adjust the policy to fit your current lifestyle and budget needs.

The woman described by Harrah's as a ""longtime customer"" of Caesars Entertainment casinos claimed the largest table game jackpot ever at one of the company's Atlantic City casinos. She was playing Ultimate Texas Holdem.

In table games which are played against the house a progressive jackpot increases each time the game is played but the jackpot is not won. It resets only after a winner claims the progressive prize



The woman's win came Dec. 17 ahead of the Christmas holiday and she generously tipped her dealers $77000 NJ.com reported. That's about 4.6% of her total prize.

""Most people give tips but this was jaw-dropping"" Harrah's Atlantic City Director of Table Games Michael Zippel said in a statement given to Fox Business. ""Our dealers work hard all year long and truly deserve it.""

At Tropicana Atlantic City another Caesars Entertainment casino a New Jersey man won a $1.1 million jackpot last February on a progressive poker game and left a $50000 tip for the dealers. That was the previous record for the company's Atlantic City properties.

Caesars Entertainment is in the midst of a $400 million investment plan to renovate its resort facilities at its three Atlantic City casinos. Its flagship casino is Caesars Atlantic City on the Boardwalk.

A proposed reform package to boost U.K. financial sector competitiveness faces critique.

Font Size: A A A

In a significant regulatory shakeup the British government has announced an extensive financial regulation reform package in an attempt to overhaul “burdensome EU laws.”

The reform package dubbed the Edinburgh Reforms consists of 30 measures such as revisions of landmark regulations introduced after the 2008 crisis. Central to the Edinburgh Reforms are revisions to a law that requires banks to keep their investment banks separate from their consumer arms the so-called “ringfencing” regime. The recent reforms also modify the Senior Managers and Certification Regime which holds bank leaders responsible for banks’ poor conduct.

Another significant change prompted by the reform package is the introduction of statutory secondary objectives for the U.K.’s financial regulators. Going forward the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority would have to consider impacts on growth and international competitiveness as part of their ongoing supervisory and regulatory activities.

British finance minister Jeremy Hunt has defended the overhaul—which has left many uneasy—against accusations that the government has forgotten the lessons learned from the 2008 financial crisis. Noting that the “lessons of 2008” must not be unlearned Hunt argued that banks are in a stronger position now than before the crisis where the then-Labour Party government spent 137 billion pounds to bail out banks.

Hunt argues that the proposed reform is only possible because of the country’s post-Brexit “regulatory freedoms.” Critics argue however that much of the U.K. financial sector’s malaise resulted from Brexit. They note that the U.K.’s departure from the EU caused firms to lose direct access to European financial markets and passporting rights a set of EU laws that allows companies in one EU country to conduct business in any other EU country freely.

The government hopes its regulatory reform will lead to a “Big Bang 2.0”—a reference to Margaret Thatcher’s deregulation of financial services in 1986 which caused an influx of capital and banks to the U.K. But according to Jonathan Herbst global head of financial services regulation at international law firm Norton Rose Fulbright the majority of financial sector regulation in the U.K. reflects “either international commitments or policy developed over many years to reflect the lessons of experience” rather than dramatic sudden changes.

In the hours after Hunt announced the Edinburgh Reforms a number of influential business groups welcomed the move. The Confederation of British Industry described as “Britain’s biggest business lobby group” argued that the reforms can “help build a more dynamic competitive and future-focused financial sector.” In a similar tone the City of London Corporation the ancient governing body of London’s primary financial district noted that the reforms would not weaken standards and that the U.K. financial services industry should be “very excited” about the reforms.

On the other side of the political aisle the Labour party’s financial services spokesperson Tulip Siddiq argued that the reforms were a part of a “race to the bottom.” She added that many of the older regulations had been “introduced for a good reason” and that the new reforms could hurt the financial industry by “introducing more risk and potentially more financial instability.”

In addition the U.K. government’s new plan to overhaul ringfencing rules has caused concern for some experts including John Vickers an economics professor at the University of Oxford and architect of the U.K.’s ringfencing regulation. In a letter to the Financial Times he argues that scaling down or removing the ringfencing regime would be detrimental to growth and cause a repeat of the 2008 crisis.

Ringfencing has been a costly affair for large U.K. banks. HSBC for example estimated in 2015 that it would spend 1.5 billion pounds to shield its U.K. retail bank from the rest of its business. The primary revisions to the ringfencing regime include raising the deposit threshold for when banks must ringfence their retail banks from 25 to 35 billion pounds and a proposal to exclude banking groups without large investment banks from the regime. But the revisions still require the largest banks in the U.K. to retain their ringfence so it appears unlikely that the reforms will spur significant change to the U.K.’s retail banking landscape.

Although the Edinburgh Reforms seek to bring about significant change to the regulation of the financial sector the government has opted to leave out provisions that would give it powers to override U.K. regulators’ decisions if they did not take advantage of the “opportunities of Brexit.” But some remnants of the proposal which received broad critique that it would undermine regulators have survived in the requirement that the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority have to consider Britain’s competitiveness and growth in their work.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A section of the $1.7 trillion spending bill passed Friday has been billed as a dramatic step toward shoring up retirement accounts of millions of U.S. workers. But the real windfall may go to a far more secure group: the financial services industry.

The retirement savings measure labeled Secure 2.0 would reset how people enroll in retirement plans — from requiring them to opt into plans to requiring them to opt out. The provision is designed to ensure greater participation.

It also allows workers to use their student loan payments as a substitute for their contributions to their retirement plans — meaning they can get matching retirement contributions from their employers by paying off that debt — increases the age for required distributions from plans and expands a tax-deductible saver's credit.

But as with so many far-reaching spending bills that get little public consideration provisions of the legislation also benefit corporate interests with a strong financial interest in the outcome.

“Some of these provisions are good and we want to help people who want to save — but this is a huge boon to the financial services industry"" says Monique Morrissey an economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute in Washington. Some parts of the bill she says are “disguised as savings incentives.”

Daniel Halperin a Harvard law professor who specializes in tax policy and retirement savings said one of the most clear benefits to industry is the provision that gradually increases the age for mandatory distributions from 72 to 75. “The goal is to leave that money there for as long as possible” in order to collect administrative fees he said. “For people who have $5 to $7 to $10 million saved firms keep collecting fees. It's crazy to allow them to leave it there.”

Companies like BlackRock Funds Services Group​ Prudential Financial Pacific Life Insurance and business lobbying groups such as the Business Roundtable and American Council of Life Insurers are only some of the entities that lobbied lawmakers on Secure 2.0 Senate lobbying disclosures show.

Katherine DeBerry a representative from Prudential said the firm applauds the passage of Secure 2.0 stating that it ""will help ensure employees’ retirement savings last a lifetime.”

A representative from Blackrock declined to comment and Pacific Life the Business Roundtable and American Council of Life Insurers did not respond to Associated Press requests for comment. The disclosure forms require only minimal information about the outcome the lobbyists sought.

Retiring Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) had been ushering Secure 2.0 through the massive spending bill known as an omnibus. Nearly half of the 92 provisions in Secure 2.0 come in full or part from Cardin-Portman legislation that was approved unanimously by the Senate Finance Committee in the summer.

“Senator Cardin is proud of his role producing a balanced package that is supported by business labor and consumer groups"" Cardin spokesperson Sue Walitsky said in a statement. “It protects and encourages retirement savings among the most vulnerable particularly lower-income individuals.”

Mollie Timmons a spokeswoman for Portman said the provisions of Secure 2.0 will “help part-time workers and help more small businesses offer retirement plans to their workers which is where most lower-income workers are employed.”

Both lawmakers' campaigns have received large contributions from firms tied to the retirement industry according to OpenSecrets — with Cardin receiving $329271 from the securities and investment industry from 2017 to 2022 and Portman receiving $515996 from the same industries in the same period.

There are good provisions in the legislation for average Americans experts say like the creation of employer emergency savings accounts alongside retirement accounts. The new accounts let workers create tax-protected rainy day funds. The legislation also expands the saver’s credit which provides a 50 percent tax credit on savings up to $2000 that will be deposited directly into a taxpayer’s IRA or retirement plan.

Morrissey and other retirement experts also say the provisions are a reminder of the need to shore up Social Security — the social program that benefits more than 70 million recipients — retirees disabled people and children. The annual Social Security and Medicare trustees report released in June says the program’s trust fund will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2035.

For many Americans Social Security — financed by payroll taxes collected from workers and their employers — is their only means of retirement savings.

In the sweeping spending package passed Friday lawmakers authorized roughly half of the $1.4 billion spending increase proposed by the Biden administration for Social Security.

“Funding for the Social Security Administration has steadily eroded over the past decade while the number of people it serves has grown” said Nancy LeaMond AARP executive vice president. ""This has resulted in longer wait times overwhelmed field offices and disability processing times that have skyrocketed to an all-time high.

“More must be done"" she said.

In a Pew Research Center poll in January 57 percent of U.S. adults said that “taking steps to make the Social Security system financially sound” should be a top priority for the president and Congress. Securing Social Security got bipartisan support with 56% of Democrats and 58% of Republicans calling it a top priority.

Nancy Altman co-director of Social Security Works an advocacy group said Congress should be adequately funding Social Security if “the goal was to really help middle income families.”

Still the latest legislation is a small step meant to assist the millions of Americans who haven’t saved for retirement.

U.S. Census data show that roughly half of Americans are saving for their retirement. In 2020 58% of working-age baby boomers owned at least one type of retirement account followed by 56% of Gen X-ers 49% of millennials and 7.7% of Gen Z-ers.

Olivia Mitchell a Wharton economist who specializes in retirement savings says the results of Secure 2.0's passage may be felt most with workers at companies that match their employees' contributions.

She said research suggests that auto-enrollment can boost retirement plan coverage initially but participation may fall over time.

Mitchell studied the first state-based plan of its kind OregonSaves which auto-enrolled workers whose firms did not have retirement savings plans. She found that only 36% of workers had a positive balance after one year. Less than half of those in the plan were still contributing after a year.

Nonetheless she said “the fact remains that low-paid workers who change jobs often are a difficult target to reach via retirement saving plans.”

This year has been shaped by uncomfortable macroeconomic headwinds.

Trillions of dollars were erased in public company market capitalizations investor confidence waned and cost pressures squeezed consumer pocketbooks.

Taken together many of the world’s largest companies experienced sharp declines in market share. Still a few companies in key sectors had positive growth over the year.

The World’s Largest Public Companies in 2022

Today Apple stands as the world’s most valuable company towering at a $2.3 trillion valuation.

Despite the tech downturn of 2022—driven by rising interest rates and slower sales—Apple maintained its top spot. This was largely thanks to record revenues and healthy consumer demand for iPhones which drive about half of its total revenue.

Following Apple is Microsoft. Unlike Apple Microsoft has faced slower earnings over the year due to lower demand for personal computers and the weighing impact of a strong U.S. dollar. Overall about 50% of the company’s sales take place overseas.

*As of Dec 12 2022.

Oil giant Saudi Aramco is the third largest publicly-traded company globally at $1.8 trillion. It’s also the only non-U.S. company in the top 10.

In May the state-run company briefly became the most valuable company on the planet as soaring energy prices boosted earnings. Saudia Arabia is the largest exporter of oil in the world and the country’s economy is forecast to grow 7.6% in 2022—one of the fastest globally.

Overall 62 companies of the 100 largest are headquartered in the U.S. 11 are based in China and five are located in France.

Top 10 Performance in 2022

For many of the world’s largest companies 2022 was a brutal year for performance.

As the above graphic shows the vast majority of the world’s titans saw their market values decline. Half of these companies saw double-digit drops.

Tesla has witnessed nearly 70% of its market cap being erased this year. Two main factors are behind this drop: falling demand especially in China and CEO Elon Musk’s volatile and risky acquisition of Twitter.

On the other hand UnitedHealth Group has seen the strongest performance among the top 10.

The company which rakes in a large share of its earnings from employer-backed insurance plans said that recessionary impacts had not yet begun materializing in 2022.

Biggest Companies in the World by Sector

Even with sinking market values across the sector in 2022 tech remains dominant.

Among the world’s biggest companies 20 are in tech spanning a combined market value of $9.2 trillion. For perspective that’s about 31% of the market value of the 100 largest companies.

Companies are classified according to the FTSE Russell Industry Classification Benchmark. *As of Dec 12 2022.

Consumer discretionary and health care sectors fall next in line with big players such as Amazon and Johnson & Johnson among their ranks.

At the other end of the spectrum is utilities the smallest sector overall at least pertaining to the largest companies list. NextEra Energy the sole utilities company among the rankings is one of the world’s largest developers of wind and solar energy. Over the next three years it plans to invest up to $95 billion in greening its power operations.

Change of Fortune

It comes as no surprise that many of the biggest companies in the world are long-established players in global markets.

Yet within the rankings some of the notable risers compared to 2021 are UnitedHealth Group which launched from #19 in 2021 to #8 this year and NVIDIA which has climbed to become the 11th largest company globally up from #24 last year.

By contrast some of the biggest losers are Meta (Facebook’s parent company) and Alibaba. Meta has fallen across the rankings to #26 in 2022 from #6 in 2021. Meanwhile Alibaba was once the ninth largest globally but has tumbled to #36. Both companies have seen considerable value wiped from their market caps—roughly 66% and 28% respectively​​—amid lagging earnings.

With the year coming to a close it remains to be seen whether the world’s biggest companies stage a comeback in 2023 or face more challenging conditions ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9wZWRpYS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvcGVyc29uYWwtZmluYW5jZS8wOTA3MTUvOC1iZXN0LWNsb3VkLXN0b3JhZ2Utc29sdXRpb25zLXNtYWxsLWJ1c2luZXNzLmFzcNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,8 Best Cloud Storage Solutions for Small Business,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9wZWRpYS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvcGVyc29uYWwtZmluYW5jZS8wOTA3MTUvOC1iZXN0LWNsb3VkLXN0b3JhZ2Utc29sdXRpb25zLXNtYWxsLWJ1c2luZXNzLmFzcNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021226CE2F50>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

America is one of the world's most industrialized regions with the largest economy in nominal terms. This also makes it one of the world's largest consumers of electricity ranking second only to China through 3.9 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2021. In terms of sources of energy consumption petroleum and natural gas account for the largest sources and renewable energy ranks in third place. Sector wise industrial transportation and electrical power use are the largest electricity consumers in the U.S. and natural gas is the most widely used production source according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Courtesy of some of the best educational institutions in the world the U.S. is also leading the charge in researching innovative mediums for generating renewable energy. Not only is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) an American firm the world's first car maker to successfully mass produce an electric vehicle but researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are investigating methods to improve electricity generation through waves and the Sun as well as new mediums to store electricity. While solar cells are common these days these materials are unable to tap the vast amounts of energy that the Sun beams down to the Earth. On this front MIT is searching for materials that are cost effective scalable reliable and efficient at the same time. To do this they are utilizing machine learning and rapid experimentation to quickly sift through materials in hopes that a new one will provide a breakthrough.

When talking about energy any discussion would be incomplete without nuclear power plants. There are two kinds of nuclear reactions fission and fusion. With the former atoms are split up to squeeze out energy from them. However the latter is vastly more powerful (and complex) since it requires squeezing the atoms together and the resulting energy is harnessed as power. Fusion is the Sun's primary energy source and all nuclear plants in the world use fission instead. In the area of fusion the U.S. federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California was able to generate more energy from a Hydrogen plasma bombarded with lasers than the electricity used in operating the lasers instead. This was a crucial breakthrough since fusion is the most efficient and cleanest source of power - even on the nuclear front as it does not generate any radioactive waste.

Story continues

Additionally America also passed one of the most important pieces of legislation for renewable energy this year in form of the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill provides roughly $370 billion in government subsidies for clean power generation. This provides the incentive for even some of the biggest American energy companies to invest in the field. Finally global crude oil prices have injected fresh rigor into renewable energy production after they jumped to a whopping $139 per barrel earlier this year in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Today we'll take a look at the largest American energy firms with the top picks being Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE).

At the core of the issue are serious concerns over issues related to governance.

A communiqué sent to the stock exchanges expresses how grave the situation is with the starting point being PTC India’s subsidiary PTC Financial Services (PFS). Three independent directors resigned in January 2022 when “the board chose to turn a blind eye to the corporate governance lapses in PFS” say the outgoing directors in their resignation letters. On the specific issue of PTC the outgoing board members have stated that their views “are either overlooked or ignored”. Besides board meetings are called at short notice with agendas not circulated in a timely manner the outgoing directors say. As things stand PTC has not had a regular Chairman and MD since Deepak Amitabh stepped down in November 2021.

A week after the spate of resignations Mohammed Afzal was brought on to the beleaguered company’s board as nominee director of the Ministry of Power. He holds the position of Joint Secretary (Transmission) in the ministry.

PTC is a public-private partnership with the promoter group holding small stakes. As of September 30 four promoters—National Hydroelectric Corporation Power Finance Corporation Power Grid Corporation and NTPC—held only 4.05 per cent each. “Obviously the promoters will not care since the holding is a small blip on their balance sheet” points out Shriram Subramanian Founder and Managing Director of InGovern a proxy advisory firm. Speaking of public shareholders LIC holds close to 6 per cent with mutual funds and banks accounting for just over 2 per cent. The list of foreign portfolio investors includes names such as Fidelity Funds Vanguard Total International and Vanguard Emerging Markets Index that hold 5.26 per cent 1.16 per cent and 1.08 per cent respectively in the company.

So what are the options left at this point for PTC? “The company needs a change in top management and a new active and accountable Board of Directors” says Subramanian of InGovern. Being a listed company makes it that much more critical that it is done he adds.

Since January 1 the PTC India stock has shed 17 per cent in value while the company’s reputation has taken a hit because of the recent happenings. Experts say that with investors’ money at stake the company needs to act fast to repair its reputation and restore confidence at all levels. But the path seems murky.

HESPERIA Calif. (VVNG.com) — Mister Car Wash received the ‘green light’ to proceed with the construction of a new car wash on Main Street providing even more options but this time at a spot that was home to a former bar that burned to the ground in 2015.

The 6464 square-foot automated car wash will sit on 1.3 gross acres of land located north of Main Street approximately 190 feet east of Jellico Avenue where the only memory left of the former Main Street Pub formerly the Rocks Club is a concrete slab and an old dilapidated sign.

(Site of the former Main Street Pub that was destroyed by fire in 2015 – Google Maps)

The new build will provide a fresh new look to the area while adding convenience to car owners and will be the first Mister Car Wash to open in the Victor Valley.

The project site contains two parcels; one of the parcels has an existing multi-tenant building that will be demolished as part of the development and the other parcel is vacant.

One of the tenants in the existing building to be demolished is Calling All Paws formerly the Funky Poodle according to Google Maps.

(Building that will be demolished to make room for the new car wash. – Google Maps.)

“The properties to the north and west consist of the Extra Space Storage facility which has several self-storage units throughout their site” a city document showed. “The properties to the south on the opposite side of Main Street consist of the Union Bank and Autozone service/retail buildings. The properties to the west are developed with a multi-tenant commercial building and Napa Auto Parts.”

(Rendings submitted to City of Hesperia)

The automated car wash building is proposed to be located at the center of the site with 3 drive-through entrance lanes on the east side of the building to accommodate a stacking of approximately 33 vehicles that will turn into a single lane.

There are 29 proposed vacuum spaces and 6 standard spaces on the west side of the building giving customers options to leave the site when exiting the car wash or make a U-turn into the vacuum spaces.

The easterly parcel of the site has an existing driveway approach that will be removed and replaced with a curb sidewalk and landscape. The site also has an existing 40-foot-wide driveway approach from Main Street that is shared with the property to the west and will remain in place. The site will also have an additional 40-foot-wide driveway approach from Main Street that will be shared with the property to the east.

(Aerial view of the parcels that will be split.)

The proposed 6464 square foot automated car wash is composed of the drive-through tunnel as well as an area for accessory equipment office space employee break room janitor area and restrooms.

The project also provides a surplus of landscaping the renderings showed meeting the minimum required landscape coverage in the Neighborhood Commercial (NC) zone.

The automated car wash proposes to operate from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Monday through Sunday needing only approximately 10 employees total with 2 to 4 employees per shift.

Drainage: Any additional runoff created on-site will be detained by a proposed underground storm drain chamber system to store the necessary volume on-site. Water and Sewer: The development will connect to an existing 12-inch water line located on Main Street and an 8-inch sewer line located north of the project site.

“Environmental: The project is categorically exempt from the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) by Section 15332 In-fill Development Projects. This exemption applies to developments on sites no larger than five acres which are consistent with the General Plan and are substantially surrounded by urban uses” a City document stated. “The project conforms to the policies of the City’s General Plan as well as the intent of the Specific Plan. In addition the proposed project will be an improvement to the site as it will eliminate the long vacancy of the building by architecturally enhancing the site and providing additional services for the residents of Hesperia.”

A representative on behalf of the applicant Cadence Southwest LLC telephoned into the meeting to participate.

“Good evening Planning Commissioners I just wanted to take this time to say thank you to Staff and their help in getting this project through. We’ve worked with them on not only the architecture but site layout and I think we have a pretty great site here it’s a great location and we’re excited to be coming to Hesperia” stated the representative who finished the call by asking the Hesperia Planning Commissioners if they had any questions.

“It’s a good-looking building that being said I have no other questions” stated Commissioner Member Raymond “Roger” Abreo.

There were no members of the public at the meeting to speak on behalf of the project.

The motion passed with a 3-0 vote with Commissioner Burke Abreo and Steeno in favor.

The company has not provided any dates pertaining to the groundbreaking of the project.

This was the second car wash approved on November 10 2022 during the Hesperia Planning Commission Meeting with the first being Quick Quack Car Wash per a previously published VVNG article.

(Supplied)

Lightspeed Commerce (LSPD.TO) has “opportunity everywhere” a Raymond James analyst says making it one of the investment firm’s top technology companies that could see price estimate hikes going into 2023.

The year 2022 was a brutal one for financial markets but particularly for technology firms. The S&P/TSX Capped Information Technology Index which includes 27 Canadian companies including Lightspeed Shopify (SHOP)(SHOP.TO) and Constellation Software (CSU.TO) was down 34 per cent in 2022 as of late December. Many technology companies saw valuations plummet erasing billions in shareholder value. Tens of thousands of workers have been laid off by large tech firms across North America.

Lightspeed the Montreal-based point-of-sale software provider has certainly not been immune to the pain inflicted on the sector. Shares of the company were down approximately 62 per cent in 2022 as of late December trading around $19 per share. It’s a far cry from the all-time high share price of $158.93 the stock hit in Sept. 2021 before it was attacked in a scathing short seller report.

But Raymond James analyst Steven Li wrote in a research note in late December that there is “opportunity everywhere” when it comes to potential upside for Lightspeed in 2023. He has set an “outperform” rating on the company with a $43 price target.

“Lightspeed certainly faces external factors outside its control that could limit upside revisions” Li wrote in a note part of Raymond James’ list of Best Picks for 2023.

“However on balance with payments monetization inflecting in recent quarters capital starting to contribute and software (average revenue per user) looking up we see Lightspeed as one of the better positioned names in terms of potential for positive estimate revisions.”

Lightspeed chief executive JP Chauvet who replaced founder Dax Dasilva as head of the company in February said in an interview with Yahoo Finance Canada in November that the company is focused on achieving profitability through a multi-pronged plan. The plan includes consolidating its products under one global brand expanding payments adoption working with established small and medium-sized merchants and “ruthlessly” analyzing spending within the company.

“We need to be cautious with every dollar we spend and ensure that we are getting a return on every dollar” Chauvet said.

“We are ruthlessly looking at the organization and ensuring that every project is not just a ‘nice to have’ but an absolute priority for us.”

The company is also bucking tech market trends when it comes to hiring. In November the company had 360 open positions and said it planned on hiring more talent through 2023.

“Unlike most companies right now we aren’t downsizing. We are still a growth story” Chauvet said.

“That is one of our challenges. We need to attract more talent but I would say it’s easier than it was a year ago because we have a lot of big tech companies that are downsizing and cutting jobs. This is going to help companies like Lightspeed.”

CIBC Capital Markets analyst Todd Coupland said Lightspeed has “a credible and reasonable path to near-term profit targets” but noted that the year could still be challenging.

“​​While we applaud Lightspeed’s focus given the slowing macro trends we expect (gross transaction volume) growth and customer additions to be lower” Coupland wrote in a note to clients.

Still Chauvet has said he sees opportunity for Lightspeed even in a recession as retailers seek efficiencies in an economic downturn.

“We’re very focused on attracting the right merchants that will not churn especially in the context of a potential recession or everybody tightening their belts” Chauvet said at the time.

“I want to be sure we are putting our marketing dollars towards attracting the right customers that are going to have the better returns.”

Here's something most HotHardware readers probably know: the same GPU core is used for many different models of graphics card. Case in point: the GA102 processor is used for every GeForce RTX 3000-series model from the RTX 3080 on up the stack . However what you may not know is that it can go the other way: sometimes a single GPU model can be made from multiple different processors depending on what NVIDIA has available.

Apparently the GeForce RTX 3050 is joining the rank of those graphics cards created out of more than one GPU design. There are already two separate models of GeForce RTX 3050 card: one based on GA106 with 2560 shaders and another  typically only found in OEM systems that is also based on GA106 but with only 2304 shaders (two SMs disabled).





The text is very small so click this image.



The previous desktop GeForce RTX 3050 cards were quite considerably cut-down from the larger GA106 die that is used in fully-enabled form on the mobile Geforce RTX 3060  with fully a third of its shaders and memory bus disabled. That's rather wasteful unless NVIDIA had a pile of GA106 dice that couldn't pass muster as RTX 3060s.









Well there's an MSI listing for a new ""OCV1"" model of GeForce RTX 3050 with once again 2560 shaders but a lower power draw of 115W. That's down from the 130W of the original ""OC"" model. Thanks to the drop it gets to step down to a six-pin power connector instead of an eight-pin plug. MSI hasn't confirmed anything but the specifications of the card rather neatly match those of the fully-enabled GA107 die.Given that the GeForce RTX 3050's specifications were already a perfect match for the GA107 die it may seem like NVIDIA planned this pairing all along. Of course we're not likely to ever know the truth about that but it's very likely that the insane state of the graphics card market over the last couple of years forced NVIDIA to change its plans on the fly just as it did everyone else.As for why the company is making this swap now it's difficult to say. Perhaps the demand for laptops with GA107-based RTX 3050 Ti and RTX 3050 GPUs has waned or perhaps it's because demand for GeForce RTX 3060 cards has increased. Likely it's a combination of multiple factors like the fact that a tremendous majority of Steam gamers are still using 20- 16- and 10-series GPUs. It's easy to think of the RTX 30 series as ""last-generation"" but it'll probably be a year or more before we see Ada Lovelace trickle down to the ""x50"" tier.You needn't pore over the specifications for the two cards; they're identical aside from the lower power consumption spec on the new model. That could mean that the new GeForce RTX 3050s can hit higher clock rates but that depends on whether any vendors bother to build a card with relatively robust power delivery. Certainly the big dual-fan cooler on these MSI cards is overkill for the little GA107 GPU.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9jb21tdW5pdHkvdG9waWNzL3RoZS1udmlkaWEtcnR4LTQwNzAtdGktaXMtbm93LWF2YWlsYWJsZS1pbi1zZXJiaWEtZm9yLTEtNDAwLjI3ODQzMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti is now available in Serbia for $1400,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.techspot.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /community/topics/the-nvidia-rtx-4070-ti-is-now-available-in-serbia-for-1-400.278433/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021223BF04F0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hzcG90LmNvbS9jb21tdW5pdHkvdG9waWNzL3RoZS1udmlkaWEtcnR4LTQwNzAtdGktaXMtbm93LWF2YWlsYWJsZS1pbi1zZXJiaWEtZm9yLTEtNDAwLjI3ODQzMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvbnZpZGlhLXJ0eC00MDkwLWlzLXlldC1hbm90aGVyLWJlYXN0LXNsYXllZC1pbi10aGUtd2l0Y2hlci0zLW5leHQtZ2VuLXVwZGF0ZS1hdC04a9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia RTX 4090 is yet another beast slayed in The Witcher 3 Next Gen Update at 8K,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyYWRhci5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvbnZpZGlhLXJ0eC00MDkwLWlzLXlldC1hbm90aGVyLWJlYXN0LXNsYXllZC1pbi10aGUtd2l0Y2hlci0zLW5leHQtZ2VuLXVwZGF0ZS1hdC04a9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021223BF2770>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Founded in 2012 Piramal Realty is the real estate development arm of business conglomerate Piramal Group. It is one of the leading developers with 15 million square feet of residential and commercial space under development in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR).

In an interview with PTI Sawhney said the company has achieved average annual sales bookings of around Rs 2000 crore in the past five years as it witnessed robust demand for its residential properties across four projects that it has launched so far.

Asked about the performance this fiscal he said ""Our target is in the range of about Rs 2200 crore. So as of now we look confident that we will cross the Rs 2000 crore mark given the demand is buoyant.""



Sales bookings were more than Rs 1500 crore last financial year he informed.

Piramal Realty is developing around 12000 apartments covering 13 million square feet area in phases across four residential projects in Mulund Thane Mahalaxmi and Byculla in the MMR.

Sawhney said the company is focusing aggressively on delivery. It has already started handing over the first set of 1000 apartments to its customers totalling about 1 million square feet.

In the next two years Piramal Realty is targeting to deliver another 6000000 (6 million) square feet.

""We will be making an investment of more than Rs 3500 crore in construction over the next two years"" Sawhney said.

In this 6 million square feet area about 4500-5000 apartments will get delivered.

Out of the 13 million square feet of planned development Piramal Realty has so far launched around 8-8.5 million square feet in these four projects. The remaining 4-5 million square feet will be launched over the next two years.

The total sales revenue potential in these four projects is estimated at around Rs 20000 crore of which around 50 per cent has already been achieved he said.

Sawhney highlighted that the company has established itself in the premium luxury segment of the market with a lot of emphasis on green initiatives better use of space inside as well as outside the apartments and community living.

""I can say at least in MMR we hold a decent position overall now that people are continuing to invest in the brand and have bought into the promise very well"" he observed.

Sawhney noted that housing demand remains strong despite rise in interest rates on home loans.

He said the mortgage rate is not the only factor in the customers mind while buying properties. Disposable income job security and salary increments are some of the other factors.

""We feel that post COVID there is very strong sentiment of home buying which gives us the confidence that it will continue to drive the demand in the market"" he added.

To encash this demand Sawhney said the company is looking at adding more land banks for future developments.

It is exploring partnerships with land owners for joint development.

In 2015 Piramal Realty had raised USD 235 million at an entity level from private equity players Warburg Pincus and Goldman Sachs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUvcGlyYW1hbC1yZWFsdHktZXllcy1ycy0zLTUwMC1jcm9yZS1pbnZlc3RtZW50LWluLWNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbi1vdmVyLW5leHQtdHdvLXllYXJzLXNheXMtY2VvLTEwMTY3MTk3ODgyNjk1OC5odG1s0gGeAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS9waXJhbWFsLXJlYWx0eS1leWVzLXJzLTMtNTAwLWNyb3JlLWludmVzdG1lbnQtaW4tY29uc3RydWN0aW9uLW92ZXItbmV4dC10d28teWVhcnMtc2F5cy1jZW8tMTAxNjcxOTc4ODI2OTU4LWFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Piramal Realty eyes ₹3500 cr investment in construction over next two years,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vcmVhbC1lc3RhdGUvcGlyYW1hbC1yZWFsdHktZXllcy1ycy0zLTUwMC1jcm9yZS1pbnZlc3RtZW50LWluLWNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbi1vdmVyLW5leHQtdHdvLXllYXJzLXNheXMtY2VvLTEwMTY3MTk3ODgyNjk1OC5odG1s0gGeAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS9waXJhbWFsLXJlYWx0eS1leWVzLXJzLTMtNTAwLWNyb3JlLWludmVzdG1lbnQtaW4tY29uc3RydWN0aW9uLW92ZXItbmV4dC10d28teWVhcnMtc2F5cy1jZW8tMTAxNjcxOTc4ODI2OTU4LWFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021223AC17B0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Two years ago consumers were not as well versed on the delicate inner workings of inventories raw consumer costs or shipping as they are today. The unwavering news of supply chain disruptions and bottlenecks including the time everyone collectively rooted for a container ship stuck in the Suez Canal readily educated consumers on just how intertwined the supply chain is with everyday life.

It was a shock to some consumers when earlier this year large retailers announced oversupply issues. Though consumers rejoiced in the news that some of their favorite stores would soon be rolling out sales those who work directly with the supply chain and the economy could recognize the considerable loss those companies were experiencing.

Retailers and manufacturers over-ordered and over-produced because they were not monitoring the economic indicators that showed supply chain constraints and labor shortages were easing.

The oversupply issue was largely caused by a lack of real-time data in planning and forecasting processes leading business leaders to make a costly overcorrection.

In a recent Accenture report 99% of the 450 CFOs surveyed reported that they need real-time data to make better decisions but only 16% of those surveyed said they have real-time data available today.

With current economic uncertainty riddling consumer sentiment an ongoing negative geopolitical climate and a continuing health crisis business professionals are asking themselves what can we do in response to current economic conditions to navigate upcoming volatility?

Create contingency plan

One of the most important things supply chain professionals can do to support planning and forecasting is to monitor external economic indicators that can directly affect their business performance. There are a multitude of indicators such as gas and oil prices weather raw material costs and industrial production that can drastically change when how and where product meets the consumer.

Due to the years of uncertainty and disruption customer-centric management is an emerging trend in supply chain planning and forecasting. This means many organizations are looking more at their customer data and overall consumer trends to make strategic business decisions. But with the lowest consumer sentiment in decades it can be difficult for companies to know how consumer spending is going to change over the next few months especially when the upcoming holiday season is taken into account.

This is where contingency planning comes into play. Now more than ever supply chain professionals need to monitor external economic data including consumer sentiment and spending to better understand what possible economic scenarios could play out. With real-time data on hand business leaders can use the projections to create best and worst possible outcomes and then plan and forecast within that range to help ensure business success.

Right now business leaders are filled with “what-if'' questions. What if consumer spending follows consumer sentiment? What if oil and gas prices rise again? What if we have to lay people off to afford wages for our employees? By monitoring the specific economic indicators that affect their business leaders can use the data to create agile contingency plans that allow for real-time updates based on how the economy changes.

Monitoring the data for proactive planning

Staying up to date on real-time economic data can be a heavy lift without the right technology. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning make it easy for business leaders to not only track economic indicators but also quantify impact and seize opportunities based on market change.

Not only can business leaders use this technology to navigate economic slowdown and volatility like we are currently experiencing but during a stable market leaders can get ahead of competitors by making constant improvements to their forecast and can drive overall better decision making and improve risk management.

AI and machine learning help business leaders become proactive decision makers instead of reactive. Even when unprecedented events come along and immediately change the economic outlook say a global pandemic for example business leaders that utilize external economic data can recover quickly and use their planning and forecasting technology to navigate the uncertainty until the time comes when they’re able to be proactive again.

Market volatility and economic uncertainty are guaranteed. As the economy ebbs and flows through various consumer trends and new business models so too will interest rates disposable income industrial production and more. By utilizing external economic data as indicators for planning and forecasting business leaders can navigate market changes and make more strategic business decisions using a mix of their company’s historic internal data and real-time economic data.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The study published in the European Journal of Neuroscience examined five different species of odontocetes (toothed whales) including Risso’s dolphins long-finned pilot whales white-beaked dolphins harbor porpoises and bottlenose dolphins.

Researchers from the University of Glasgow the Universities of St Andrews and Edinburgh and the Moredun Research Institute found that four animals from different dolphin species showed signs of changes in their brains associated with Alzheimer's disease in humans.

The study found amyloid-beta plaques (clumps of naturally occurring proteins that collect between neurons and disrupt cell function) in the brains of the dolphins as well as a number of other signs of Alzheimer's.

The brain changes could explain why some dolphins become stranded as a group leader with these changes may become confused or lost although the researchers were unable to confirm if the changes result in cognitive deficits like they do with humans.

“These are significant findings that show for the first time that the brain pathology in stranded odontocetes is similar to the brains of humans affected by clinical Alzheimer’s disease"" said lead author Dr Mark Dagleish from the University of Glasgow in a press release. ""While it is tempting at this stage to speculate that the presence of these brain lesions in odontocetes indicates that they may also suffer with the cognitive deficits associated with human Alzheimer’s disease more research must be done to better understand what is happening to these animals.”

Co-author Professor Frank Gunn-Moore from the University of St Andrews added ""I have always been interested in answering the question: do only humans get dementia? Our findings answer this question as it shows potential dementia associated pathology is indeed not just seen in human patients. This study is also a great example of both different research institutes but also different branches of the Life Sciences working together.”

Professor Tara Spires-Jones University of Edinburgh noted that the researchers were ""fascinated to see brain changes in aged dolphins similar to those in human ageing and Alzheimer’s disease. Whether these pathological changes contribute to these animals stranding is an interesting and important question for future work.”"

The finding of 'reasonable' evidence to conclude that the U.S. ally had breached international law in its conduct of the war in Gaza was released in a summary of a report being delivered to Congress on Friday.

It is the strongest statement that the Biden administration has made yet.

But the caveat that the U.S. was unable immediately to link specific U.S. weapons to individual strikes by Israeli forces in Gaza could give the administration leeway in any future decision on whether to restrict provisions of offensive weapons to Israel.

The first-of-its-kind assessment which was compelled by President Joe Biden´s fellow Democrats in Congress comes after seven months of airstrikes ground fighting and aid restrictions that have claimed the lives of nearly 35000 Palestinians mostly women and children.

Those were launched in response to Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7 2023 that saw 1300 Israelis murdered.

While U.S. officials were unable to gather all the information they needed on specific strikes the report said given Israel's 'significant reliance' on U.S.-made weapons it was 'reasonable to assess' that they had been used by Israel's security forces in instances 'inconsistent' with its obligations under international humanitarian law 'or with best practices for mitigating civilian harm.'

Israel's military has the experience technology and know-how to minimize harm to civilians but 'the results on the ground including high levels of civilian casualties raise substantial questions as to whether the IDF is using them effectively in all cases' the report said.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen the Maryland Democrat who led the push in Congress told reporters that even even though the administration had reached a general finding 'they´re ducking a determination on the hard cases politically inconvenient cases.'

Biden has tried to walk an ever-finer line in his support of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu´s war against Hamas.

He has faced growing rancor at home and abroad over the soaring Palestinian death toll and the onset of famine caused in large part by Israeli restrictions on the movement of food and aid into Gaza.

Tensions have been heightened further in recent weeks by Netanyahu´s pledge to expand the Israeli military´s offensive in the crowded southern city of Rafah despite Biden's adamant opposition.

Biden is in the closing months of a tough reelection campaign against Donald Trump. He faces demands from many Democrats that he cut the flow of offensive weapons to Israel and denunciation from Republicans who accuse him of wavering on support for Israel at its time of need.

Rep. Michael McCaul the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said the review was unnecessary 'and only contributes to politically motivated anti-Israel sentiment.'

'Now is the time to stand with our ally Israel and ensure they have the tools they need' he said in a statement.

The Democratic administration took one of the first steps toward conditioning military aid to Israel in recent days when it paused a shipment of 3500 bombs out of concern over Israel´s threatened offensive on Rafah a southern city crowded with more than a million Palestinians a senior administration official said.

The presidential directive agreed to in February obligated the Defense and State departments to conduct 'an assessment of any credible reports or allegations that such defense articles and as appropriate defense services have been used in a manner not consistent with international law including international humanitarian law.'

Nothing in the presidential directive would have triggered any cutoff of arms if the administration had more definitively ruled that Israel´s conduct had violated international law.

The agreement also obligated them to tell Congress whether they deemed that Israel has acted to 'arbitrarily to deny restrict or otherwise impede directly or indirectly' delivery of any U.S.-supported humanitarian aid into Gaza for starving civilians there.

On this question the report cited 'deep concerns' that Israel played a significant role in preventing adequate aid from reaching starving Palestinians. However it said Israel had recently taken some positive steps although still inadequate and the U.S. government did not currently find Israel restricting aid deliveries in a way that violated U.S. law governing foreign militaries that receive U.S. military aid.

Van Hollen accused the administration of glossing over what he said were clear Israeli blocks on food and aid deliveries during much of the war. 'That´s why we have hundreds of thousands of Palestinians that have nothing to do with Hamas on the verge of starvation' he said.

Lawmakers and others who advocated for the review said Biden and previous American leaders have followed a double standard when enforcing U.S. laws governing how foreign militaries use U.S. support an accusation the Biden administration denies. They had urged the administration to make a straightforward legal determination of whether there was credible evidence that specific Israeli airstrikes on schools crowded neighborhoods medical workers aid convoys and other targets and restrictions on aid shipments into Gaza violated the laws of war and human rights.

Their opponents argued that a U.S. finding against Israel would weaken it at a time it is battling Hamas and other Iran-backed groups. Any sharply critical findings on Israel are sure to add to pressure on Biden to curb the flow of weapons and money to Israel´s military and further heighten tensions with Netanyahu´s hard-right government over its conduct of the war against Hamas.

Any finding against Israel also could endanger Biden´s support in this year's presidential elections from some voters who keenly support Israel.

At the time the White House agreed to the review it was working to head off moves from Democratic lawmakers and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont to start restricting shipments of weapons to Israel.

Israel launched its offensive after an Oct. 7 assault into Israel led by Hamas killed about 1200 people. Two-thirds of the Palestinians killed since then have been women and children according to local health officials. U.S. and U.N. officials say Israeli restrictions on food shipments since Oct. 7 have brought on full-fledged famine in northern Gaza.

Human rights groups long have accused Israeli security forces of committing abuses against Palestinians and have accused Israeli leaders of failing to hold those responsible to account. In January in a case brought by South Africa the top U.N. court ordered Israel to do all it could to prevent death destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza but the panel stopped short of ordering an end to the military offensive.

Israel says it is following all U.S. and international law that it investigates allegations of abuse by its security forces and that its campaign in Gaza is proportional to the existential threat it says is posed by Hamas.

Biden in December said 'indiscriminate bombing' was costing Israel international backing. After Israeli forces targeted and killed seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen in April the Biden administration for the first time signaled it might cut military aid to Israel if it didn´t change its handling of the war and humanitarian aid.

Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush in the 1980s and early 1990s were the last presidents to openly hold back weapons or military financing to try to push Israel to change its actions in the region or toward Palestinians.

A report to the Biden administration by an unofficial self-formed panel including military experts academics and former State Department officials detailed Israeli strikes on aid convoys journalists hospitals schools and refugee centers and other sites. They argued that the civilian death toll in those strikes - such as an Oct. 31 strike on an apartment building reported to have killed 106 civilians - was disproportionate to the blow against any military target."

For example although software-as-a-service business Salesforce.com lost money for years while it grew recurring revenue if you held shares since 2005 you'd have done very well indeed. Nonetheless only a fool would ignore the risk that a loss making company burns through its cash too quickly.

Given this risk we thought we'd take a look at whether Ebusco Holding (AMS:EBUS) shareholders should be worried about its cash burn. In this article we define cash burn as its annual (negative) free cash flow which is the amount of money a company spends each year to fund its growth. Let's start with an examination of the business' cash relative to its cash burn.

See our latest analysis for Ebusco Holding

How Long Is Ebusco Holding's Cash Runway?

A company's cash runway is the amount of time it would take to burn through its cash reserves at its current cash burn rate. As at June 2022 Ebusco Holding had cash of €151m and such minimal debt that we can ignore it for the purposes of this analysis. Looking at the last year the company burnt through €86m. So it had a cash runway of approximately 21 months from June 2022. Importantly analysts think that Ebusco Holding will reach cashflow breakeven in 3 years. That means unless the company reduces its cash burn quickly it may well look to raise more cash. Depicted below you can see how its cash holdings have changed over time.

How Well Is Ebusco Holding Growing?

It was quite stunning to see that Ebusco Holding increased its cash burn by 1056% over the last year. As if that's not bad enough the operating revenue also dropped by 37% making us very wary indeed. In light of the above-mentioned we're pretty wary of the trajectory the company seems to be on. Clearly however the crucial factor is whether the company will grow its business going forward. So you might want to take a peek at how much the company is expected to grow in the next few years.

How Hard Would It Be For Ebusco Holding To Raise More Cash For Growth?

Since Ebusco Holding can't yet boast improving growth metrics the market will likely be considering how it can raise more cash if need be. Companies can raise capital through either debt or equity. One of the main advantages held by publicly listed companies is that they can sell shares to investors to raise cash and fund growth. By looking at a company's cash burn relative to its market capitalisation we gain insight on how much shareholders would be diluted if the company needed to raise enough cash to cover another year's cash burn.

Since it has a market capitalisation of €802m Ebusco Holding's €86m in cash burn equates to about 11% of its market value. As a result we'd venture that the company could raise more cash for growth without much trouble albeit at the cost of some dilution.

How Risky Is Ebusco Holding's Cash Burn Situation?

Even though its increasing cash burn makes us a little nervous we are compelled to mention that we thought Ebusco Holding's cash burn relative to its market cap was relatively promising. Shareholders can take heart from the fact that analysts are forecasting it will reach breakeven. We don't think its cash burn is particularly problematic but after considering the range of factors in this article we do think shareholders should be monitoring how it changes over time. For us it's always important to consider risks around cash burn rates. But investors should look at a whole range of factors when researching a new stock. For example it could be interesting to see how much the Ebusco Holding CEO receives in total remuneration.

Of course Ebusco Holding may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity or this list of stocks that insiders are buying.

America is one of the world's most industrialized regions with the largest economy in nominal terms. This also makes it one of the world's largest consumers of electricity ranking second only to China through 3.9 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2021. In terms of sources of energy consumption petroleum and natural gas account for the largest sources and renewable energy ranks in third place. Sector wise industrial transportation and electrical power use are the largest electricity consumers in the U.S. and natural gas is the most widely used production source according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Courtesy of some of the best educational institutions in the world the U.S. is also leading the charge in researching innovative mediums for generating renewable energy. Not only is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) an American firm the world's first car maker to successfully mass produce an electric vehicle but researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are investigating methods to improve electricity generation through waves and the Sun as well as new mediums to store electricity. While solar cells are common these days these materials are unable to tap the vast amounts of energy that the Sun beams down to the Earth. On this front MIT is searching for materials that are cost effective scalable reliable and efficient at the same time. To do this they are utilizing machine learning and rapid experimentation to quickly sift through materials in hopes that a new one will provide a breakthrough.

When talking about energy any discussion would be incomplete without nuclear power plants. There are two kinds of nuclear reactions fission and fusion. With the former atoms are split up to squeeze out energy from them. However the latter is vastly more powerful (and complex) since it requires squeezing the atoms together and the resulting energy is harnessed as power. Fusion is the Sun's primary energy source and all nuclear plants in the world use fission instead. In the area of fusion the U.S. federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California was able to generate more energy from a Hydrogen plasma bombarded with lasers than the electricity used in operating the lasers instead. This was a crucial breakthrough since fusion is the most efficient and cleanest source of power - even on the nuclear front as it does not generate any radioactive waste.

Story continues

Additionally America also passed one of the most important pieces of legislation for renewable energy this year in form of the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill provides roughly $370 billion in government subsidies for clean power generation. This provides the incentive for even some of the biggest American energy companies to invest in the field. Finally global crude oil prices have injected fresh rigor into renewable energy production after they jumped to a whopping $139 per barrel earlier this year in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Today we'll take a look at the largest American energy firms with the top picks being Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE).

After a world-changing few years where soothing greens pale pinks and cool neutrals helped create more calming indoor environments expect to see the start of a return to more dramatic shades for 2023. ""Strength earthiness and positivity: These are the feelings people will be hoping to inspire so we'll be seeing rich bold colors with lots of pigment and backbone"" says paint and color expert Annie Sloan creator of Chalk Paint. ""There's been a thirst for joy-sparking hues and a lot of experimentation recently (long may it continue!) that shows no signs of slowing down.""

Here experts share the color families specific shades techniques and trends that might just inspire a mini home makeover of your own.

All Shades of Brown

Whether you're charmed by the pale beiges of a coastal beach or the deep soil hues of your backyard garden incorporating hues of warmer brown inspired by the world around you—instead of the cooler grays that have been popular recently—helps anchor and richen the atmosphere of your space.

""Brown is an earth tone meaning it makes us feel grounded and more connected to nature"" says Sue Wadden director of color marketing at Sherwin-Williams. ""People are looking to bring warmth into the home but they also are looking to bring energy into their spaces and browns can help a space feel both warm and lively.""

Wadden points to softer lighter hues in the brown and beige color families like Redend Point Cool Beige and Malted Milk. These are all alluring options for those interested in the brown color trend since they inspire ""self-care and providing care for others"" she says.

A Range of Reds

In contrast to the ubiquitous blush pinks of the last few years richer more energetic reds will dominate in 2023. And we're not just talking about cherry shades—berry tones wine hues and bold magentas are here to stay. ""For those who want to play around with red but aren't ready to bring in the full brightness of the color I recommend more muted and darker reds like a blackberry or merlot"" says Wadden. ""My favorites are Red Barn and Carnelian.""

Ready to go for it? Pantone's 2023 Color of the Year Viva Magenta is a crimson hue that balances warm and cool undertones. ""Viva Magenta is a celebratory color—it's more active and has vigor attached to it"" says Leatrice Eiseman executive director of the Pantone Color Institute. ""We are trying to encourage and uplift people who use it.""

Warmer Neutrals

Neutral shades are the foundation of most color palettes since they allow homeowners to adjust furniture accessories or accent walls without a full makeover. Next year expect to see whites beiges tans and grays with warmer undertones say experts.

""There is certainly a move away from the cooler gray tones so beloved for the last decade to those that feel kinder and warmer"" says Joa Studholme color curator at Farrow & Ball. ""We now want colors that are lasting experiences in our homes and reflect a little more of our personality."" She suggests the brand's Stirabout and slightly stronger Jitney—both still have an underlying gray but give homeowners a chance to embrace earthy subtle tones that warm and nourish.

Behr's neutral pick for 2023 is Blank Canvas a creamy use-anywhere goes-with-everything white. ""Blank Canvas a timeless warm white is a great choice to create a clean and crisp feel in any setting"" says Erika Woelfel vice president of color and creative services. ""It also works nicely when combined with a dark green like Vine Leaf a blue-gray like Adirondack Blue or even with a black tone like Cracked Pepper.""

GETTY IMAGES

Green Everything

Green—one of the most popular color families for several years—remains a go-to shade. Expect to see it used increasingly as a neutral and not just in olive Kelly or leaf-colored accents. ""If you think of green in nature we see it against everything—everything works against green"" says Eiseman.

Pair it with tropical brights like mauve mango peach and aqua or understated comforting neutrals. ""Greens are certainly an ongoing theme"" says Eiseman. ""It has that wonderful neutrality that makes it work with so many other shades.""

""Shades of green as a color that evokes nature can be more calming and serene"" says Clare founder Nicole Gibbons noting that ocean leaf and forest shades are some of the brand's most popular.

Pairing Warm and Cool Tones

Eiseman thinks homeowners will lean into mixing warm and cool tones within the same room—using a turquoise or green to complement beige adding a vibrant blue-toned pop of purple against tan or allowing a deep green to cool a warm brown. The overall goal she says is to offer ways to incorporate favorite items you already own—like a yellow bedspread lavender plates or pink vase—into updated palettes for a refreshed atmosphere.

""Trends are all about creating freshness and newness"" she says. ""We're not suggesting you throw everything out and start over. If you have things you love using them in a new color combination can make all the difference.""

If you do decide to mix warm and cool tones within the same space just make sure you have an overarching vision based on one or the other Eiseman cautions; use the second within your accents. ""A room should never be so mixed up that you can't tell if it's warm or cool"" she says. ""One temperature should be more prevalent than the other.""

Colors That Convey Comfort and Peace

Making your house feel like a home—inviting cozy and comfortable—remains a powerful motivator when picking paint say our experts. ""Overall comfort will continue to be a key design element as we transition into 2023"" says Sue Kim director of color marketing at Valspar. ""Shades that offer a soothing environment with nature's touch inside the home—that are also versatile in many spaces—will continue to be popular.""

""A color like Cozy White evokes the feelings of warmth and security that come with being in familiar and comfortable surroundings—or a color like Southern Road is grounded and natural and embraces slowing down and the organic lifestyle"" she adds.

GETTY IMAGES

Bold Accent Shades

Experts also anticipate seeing clients combine eye-catching shades in unexpected places—moving away from layers of white ivory beige and cream layered into minimalist rooms and into more adventurous palettes and techniques. ""We no longer have to stick to only thinking about color being used between the baseboard and the ceiling: Color can enhance our lives in a myriad of ways be it checkered floors colored trim two colors with a tide line on walls or a gloss ceiling"" says Studholme.

Studholme believes that the most defining paint trend of 2023 will involve how we use color—not just the color itself. ""People will become braver in using stronger colors even if they use them in very small amounts. Think spicy Bamboozle on the inside of a closet just to make you smile or earthy yellow like India Yellow painted on the reveals or frames of windows to create a constant feeling of sunshine"" she says.

A More Colorful Aesthetic Overall

Open floorplans may have inspired many homeowners to use a single color throughout their entire space but incorporating different tones into each area—or adding unexpected accents—allows you to create visual zones for different parts of your layout. ""Since the pandemic our houses have to work so much harder for us as we need to zone areas to cook work and play in so we are introducing more color and using it in different ways"" says Studholme.

At Clare Gibbons and her team see ""punchy vibrant"" colors drawing the most interest via social media and page views. ""For the average person there's something really aspirational about going outside of that beige or white box"" she says. ""People default to what's easy so we're working on ways to inspire people more to step outside of that color comfort zone and try things that they otherwise wouldn't have considered. I think that's where the real magic happens.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9jdWx0dXJlLzIwMjIvZGVjLzI2L2NocmlzdG1hcy1jdWx0dXJhbC1lc2NhcGVz0gFKaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvMjAyMi9kZWMvMjYvY2hyaXN0bWFzLWN1bHR1cmFsLWVzY2FwZXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bah humbug: anti-Christmas treats for the tinseled-out,"Film

There is plenty of cheer in the unapologetically silly raunchy comedy Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar but none of it particularly festive. It’s written by Annie Mumolo and Kristen Wiig – the team behind hit 2011 film Bridesmaids – and the two comedians also star as small-town Nebraskans having a rollicking good time on their first ever vacation. The fictional Florida town of Vista Del Mar is saturated in beachy summery hues the hotel pool is an exquisite aquamarine blue and talking crabs and mermaids feature. Yet in this cheerful idyll danger brews in the form of a sun-avoiding supervillain plotting revenge on the forever-tanned Floridians. Jamie Dornan playing the Hawaiian shirt-loving henchman is a particular delight. Rebecca Liu

Agnes Martin’s life story and art are an antidote to Christmas excess its noise and crowds. In the 1960s the abstract painter and student of Zen left New York’s art scene for New Mexico’s empty open wilderness. Her gridded paintings offset geometry with nature’s unpredictability: their straight lines are hand-drawn with wavering pencil while the rough canvas is tangible through her thin washes of pastel paint. On the one hand they are pure abstraction but they also suggest the desert’s luminous blissfully people-free expanse. This late series saw Martin return to titling her works which channelled positive memories. Her Happy Holiday from 1999 is a serene vision in the wispy pale peach and blue of a winter dawn.

As the old adage goes the best way to get over an old year is to get stuck straight into a new one – or something like that. If the lethargy of Crimbo limbo and endless 2022 retrospectives are getting you down stick on Nia Archives’ Forbidden Feelingz and Headz Gone West EPs instead; one of the hottest tipped artists for 2023 her diasporic upbeat blend of reggae house jungle and lo-fi lovers rock feels distinctly like the future guaranteed to get even the weariest of December heads nodding in approval.

Book

View image in fullscreen American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis.

What could be less Christmassy than Patrick Bateman the protagonist of American Psycho talking about beating up homeless people ripping the skin off his victims or hitting someone in the face with an axe? Nothing. Except perhaps Patrick Bateman extolling the virtues of Huey Lewis and the News. Bret Easton Ellis’s savage evisceration of the creatures who wander around Wall Street is an admittedly extreme escape from seasonal jollity – but highly effective. It’s as compelling as it is horrifying as funny as it is disturbing. There is even serious food for thought alongside all the cannibalism. Ultimately this book is a profoundly effective takedown of power money and consumerism. It might not make you feel better – but it will make you feel different. Sam Jordison

What better way to escape the forced warmth and cordiality of Christmas than to retreat under the covers and watch a show about one of the definitive fictional loners? In the psychological thriller Mr Robot Elliot who is managing alienation depression substance abuse and dissociative identity disorder redirects his daytime skills as a computer engineer into deceiving people to hack into their accounts. For good though. He connects with people through their social networks and deals with their enemies. Like a perverse overly online Batman he becomes a “cyber vigilante” working to destroy “evil” corporations including the one that killed his father subtly named E Corp. In the end his uninvited interference in people’s lives is more Santa than Satan but you would be less delighted to find him in your house at 2am helping himself to milk from the fridge.

In the late 2000s it was style blogs and before that glossy print magazines. Now TikTok is filling that role as the place where users go to find out what’s in style.

In its end-of-year style report released on Wednesday styling service Stitch Fix reported that clients referencing TikTok as inspiration and guidance for trends and styles had increased by 85% in the last two years. At the same time references to Instagram had decreased.

TikTok has been the driving factor behind both broader trends in style — like the move away from skinny jeans — and the popularization of specific products like the Gap logo hoodie and the Skims dress. For Jarah Burke fashion account director at marketing firm Power Digital TikTok’s reach (1 billion active users as of November) is one way it’s dominating trends but so is the way it motivates users to turn anything they’re doing into a “vibe.”

“On TikTok people play up the aesthetic side of a hobby” Burke told Glossy in regard to TikTok fueling the skiwear trend. “The ‘vibification’ of activities can be a way for a brand to bring new people into its fold in an aspirational manner.”

Other big TikTok trends throughout the year have come from the #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt hashtag including the viral Birkenstock clogs the L.L. Bean tote bag and countless microtrends that quickly rose and fell on the platform including strawberry dresses knot shirts and combat boots.

Natalie Levy CEO of SPARC Group — the joint venture between Simon Property Group and Authentic Brands Group — credited TikTok with helping revitalize one of SPARC’s owned brands Aeropostale. When women’s denim began to move away from skinny jeans and toward a looser fit on TikTok in 2021 Aeropostale’s “mom jeans” went viral on the platform leading to a spike in denim sales and a shift in Aeropostale’s denim strategy. Loose denim made up only 7% of Aeropostale denim sales in 2020 but it’s now 40%. The brand’s profits grew by about 15% this year.

“We’ve doubled down on TikTok since then because we see how strong the ROI is” Levy said though the company does not disclose specific ad spending amounts. Aerpostale now works with dozens of TikTok influencers including Lexi Hidalgo (2.1 million followers) via paid posts plus it gifts products. “We’ve had a lot of viral moments on TikTok.”

Further proof of its influence aggregating trends that began on TikTok has caught on. Publications like Who What Wear Refinery29 and Popsugar regularly post lists with headlines like “The 8 Fall Trends That Have Blown Up on TikTok” “These Fashion Brands Are Going Viral On TikTok Right Now” and “7 Viral Fashion Items Trending on TikTok Right Now.”

Instagram has obviously noticed the ways TikTok has won over the fashion world introducing copycat features like Reels. In turn prominent users like Kim Kardashian urged Instagram to “Stop trying to be TikTok.” Other platforms like YouTube Amazon and Etsy have all introduced their own TikTok-like short-form video feeds this year. But TikTok is not above copying successful competitors as it did with a feature imitating BeReal launched in September.

As consumers and fashion media go to TikTok for guidance on fashion trends it makes sense that fashion brands are following. It’s helped established brands like Burberry continue to grow and helped struggling brands like Banana Republic find new audiences.",,,,,,,,,

We're sorry we just hallucinated. Are we seeing four Gemini vegetarians images of Reese Witherspoon?

Yes we know we talk a lot about how the actress' kids Ava Phillippe 23 Deacon Phillippe 19 and Tennessee Toth 10 look just like her. But in our defense she keeps presenting us with more and more evidence.

Take for instance her latest snap. On Christmas the Legally Blonde alum shared a glimpse inside her family's holiday celebrations with a sweet picture of her brood gathered around the fireplace. (Quick refresher: She shares Ava and Deacon with ex Ryan Phillippe. Reese and husband Jim Toth are parents to Tennessee.) While Deacon wore a casual sweater and Tennessee put on a hoodie Ava glowed in a festive green shirt. To complete the look she tied her pigtail braids in red ribbon.

And in another snap the trio are seen in front of the Christmas tree this time joined by Reese and husband Jim. And simply put it's like looking at quadruplets—and Jim."

Utilities have been one of the hottest topics of 2022 as the Russian invasion of Ukraine ushered in a wave of inflation especially in Europe. In fact in the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) energy inflation stood at 28.1% on average. The bulk of this inflation was contributed by 13 countries all of which saw energy inflation soar above a painful 30%. The largest inflation was in Italy where energy prices soared by a whopping 71% annually in October.

The U.S on the other hand saw relatively 'muted' energy inflation that stood at just 17.3% in the same month. This was the third lowest among all G7 economies and the primary reason that Americans remained better off was that they do not rely on Russian energy imports. However this does not mean that prices are low as natural gas and coal shortages have nevertheless pushed up retail utility prices to five year highs especially as record natural gas prices ended up driving the cost of producing electricity. For America these price increases are unavoidable since the largest portion (35.4%) of electricity is generated via natural gas. The price volatility itself has expedited the shift to renewable energy among utilities according to the IEA.

However these prices which end up in massive profits for power producers do have a silver lining. According to Bloomberg these companies are selling excess capacity at lower prices - rates that coal and gas producers cannot match. This according to analysts can end up putting the coal companies out of business and reducing emissions in the long term. The latest in the U.S. energy and utility sector these days is Winter Storm Elliott which has disrupted oil and gas output - which in turn has led to higher prices and power blackouts all over the country. U.S. benchmark oil prices jumped to $79.56 a barrel while power prices soared to $3700 per megawatt hour. Some oil companies that suffered from the reduced output are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC).

Today we will look at which companies are the largest when it comes to providing electricity and gas to Americans. Some largest U.S. utilities are Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK) NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and The Southern Company (NYSE:SO).

Southwest Airlines does things very differently than other airlines in the United States. Arguably the most distinctive aspect of the Southwest travel experience is how the airline boards planes. Some people love it while others hate it.

During my recent trip to Austin I flew Southwest for the first time in years so I wanted to write a post about the carrier’s boarding process. In the next installment I’ll be reviewing the flight as such.

How boarding works on Southwest Airlines

Southwest Airlines is the only major airline in the world that doesn’t assign seats. Rather the airline has a very different boarding process — the order of passenger boarding is determined by the “position” someone is in and as a result that’s also the order in which people can pick seats once on the plane.

If you ask me Southwest’s boarding process is quite polarizing. On the one hand it’s often referred to as a “cattle call” and at times it can get a bit frantic especially toward the end of the boarding process. On the other hand it’s surprisingly orderly much more so than on many other airlines.

Southwest assigns boarding positions rather than seats

Southwest Airlines passengers are assigned specific boarding positions consisting of a letter and then a number:

You’ll either be in group A B or C with A being allowed to board first B being allowed to board second and C being allowed to board last

You’ll be given a specific number within that range which determines the order in which you can board within each group

In other words the person with boarding position A1 can board first while the person with boarding position C60 can board last (if the number gets that high on a particular flight). While other airlines board passengers based on larger zones on Southwest there’s quite literally a person-by-person priority for boarding.

Southwest Airlines has a unique boarding process

The logistics of boarding Southwest flights

With most airlines you kind of just have a mob that storms the gate when boarding is about to start. By comparison Southwest’s boarding process is quite civilized. Southwest’s gates typically have six big “markers” each of which lists numbers. On the left side you’ll see numbers 1-30 and on the right side you’ll see numbers 31-60. Each sign indicates where you should stand based on your boarding position with ranges of five numbers.

As you can tell at each given point this setup can accommodate up to 60 people with 30 on each side. There are then monitors at the very front of this line which indicate whether groups A B or C are boarding. In other words once group C is boarding the up to 60 people will be able to line up.

Southwest Airlines boarding gate

You’ll want to line up in the exact area where your number is. In other words if group C boarding starts and you’re assigned position C2 you’d want to stand in the 1-5 section. It’s customary to ask those around you what their position is so you can be sure you’re in the right order (in other words you’d want to make sure you’re behind C1 and in front of C3).

While everyone does have to line up with this system there’s not really a rush or panic unlike on some other airlines. There’s no need to get in line a long time before boarding. Rather you can line up just a couple of minutes before boarding starts and get in the appropriate line. Just make sure that you don’t line up until your general group is being boarded. In other words if you’re in group C don’t get in line until group A and group B are totally boarded.

Southwest Airlines family boarding & more

We’re used to airlines offering to pre-board families those needing extra time military etc. How does that work on Southwest Airlines?

Southwest allows family boarding between groups A and B; this allows up to two adults traveling with a child six years old or younger to board at this time assuming they’re not already in group A

Southwest allows active duty US military (with a valid ID) to board between groups A and B assuming they’re not already in group A

Southwest allows those requiring extra time to board between groups A and B ahead of family boarding assuming they’re not already in group A

As you can tell the intent is to provide these passengers the opportunity to sit together though only after the first set of passengers board and are able to get the best seats (bulkheads exit rows etc.).

Note that the only passengers who can board before group A are those in wheelchairs. On some routes there are quite a few wheelchair passengers so often many of the best seats will be occupied by those travelers.

How Southwest boarding positions are determined

Southwest Airlines boarding priority is determined based on when you check-in. To secure the best possible boarding position you’ll want to check-in online exactly 24 hours out. The closer to departure you check-in the worse your boarding priority will be.

Below I’ll talk about some of the ways to get upgraded boarding but checking in early is generally going to be your best bet. Now I’d note that just because you check-in exactly 24 hours out doesn’t mean you’ll have a great boarding position. For example I checked in 24 hours in advance (to the second) and I was assigned position B16. In other words 75 people (A1-60 and B1-15) had higher priority for boarding than I did.

Still if you check in exactly 24 hours out you’ll almost certainly be able to avoid a middle seat if that’s your goal.

I should also mention that if you’re traveling with others but don’t have consecutive boarding groups you can either board separately or can board with the lower priority. However you can’t have someone else board with your higher priority. Southwest also doesn’t allow reserving seats for others once onboard.

How to secure early boarding on Southwest

As mentioned above checking in 24 hours out is the best way to secure a decent boarding position. However how do you secure the best boarding positions if the goal is to get a bulkhead seat or an exit row? There are a few things to consider:

If you purchase a Business Select fare (Southwest’s most premium fares) this automatically comes with A1-15 boarding

If you have Southwest Rapid Rewards A-List status you’ll receive a boarding position immediately behind Business Select so you can expect it to generally be in the A16-A30 range

You can pay for EarlyBird Check-In where Southwest will automatically check you in 36 hours before departure; while this should get you a good boarding position (almost always in zone A) note that it doesn’t guarantee a specific boarding priority as you’re behind Business Select customers and A-List members

The day of departure you can purchase upgraded boardings in positions A1-15 subject to availability; note that this will only be available if all the Business Select fares weren’t purchased

Having co-branded Southwest Airlines credit cards can potentially help you secure early boarding as well:

Southwest Airlines doesn’t assign seats

Is Southwest’s boarding process awesome or awful?

People seem to either love or hate Southwest Airlines’ boarding process. Let me share my take on that based on a couple of different factors.

Southwest’s boarding is surprisingly orderly

While some people like to refer to Southwest’s boarding process as a “cattle call” in my experience this offers one of the most organized boarding processes in terms of how people line up in the gate area.

On other airlines people tend to crowd the gate area even when it isn’t their turn to board. Meanwhile at Southwest everyone has an exact spot where they’re supposed to be and that also minimizes the unnecessary crowding.

Personally I’m a bit surprised by how consistently orderly the Southwest boarding process seems to be since there’s a bit of a learning curve to understanding this compared to other airlines. I guess it shows you that Southwest has quite a few loyal customers who are used to this system.

Southwest boarding is surprisingly orderly

I don’t like not having an assigned seat

While the boarding process is pretty organized in the gate area I find it to be a different story once onboard at least on a full flight. I know in theory the open seating concept is supposed to speed up boarding but that doesn’t necessarily match my experience at least based on the flight that I took.

There were all kinds of people going to the back of the plane trying to sit together only to later be coming back “upstream” to find seats. Toward the end of the boarding process the crew was offering free drinks to anyone willing to move in order to have a mother and daughter sit together. You had several people trying to reserve seats for others only to be told they couldn’t do that.

So while I can appreciate that being able to sit anywhere is theoretically efficient it can become a game of musical chairs if a flight is full.

I do think this process is pretty fair in the sense that everyone has the same chance of getting at least an aisle or a window seat by just checking in early. I prefer that to how other airlines like to charge even for regular economy seats.

However as an elite member and frequent flyer personally I prefer knowing exactly where I’ll be sitting so that I can plan my flight accordingly. For example if I’m going to be in a middle seat I’ll probably just load entertainment on a personal device while otherwise I might plan on trying to work the entire flight.

People either love or hate Southwest’s boarding

Bottom line

Southwest Airlines takes a different approach to boarding than other airlines. Rather than assigning seats the airline has open seating and allows passengers to board in a specific order.

Some people love Southwest’s boarding process as it’s a rather fair way to go about boarding and it’s also quite organized. However many don’t like not having an assigned seat and find it to be kind of chaotic once onboard.

What do you make of Southwest’s boarding process? Do you love it or hate it? Any tips I missed?"

We've all heard the talk for years from friends and social media about the Starbucks ""secret menu."" From the ""Harry Potter""-themed Butterbeer Frappuccino to the obviously-named Purple Drink everyone has tried or heard rumors of unofficial Starbucks beverages you can order to mix up your morning routine. But who makes these drinks? And does Starbucks actually recognize them as part of an official ""secret menu""?

According to The Motley Fool there are over 170000 different possible ways to combine and customize Starbucks ingredients to form different drinks and the company allows and even encourages customers to make special requests leading to some interesting concoctions. Some of these ideas were so good that they've gained popularity via word of mouth and social media gaining common knowledge status. Motley Fool notes that the Cotton Candy Frappuccino is one of these drinks that while not officially on the menu is well known enough that many baristas would be able to make it without much hesitation.

However while there is an entire website dedicated to the Starbucks secret menu and its various options the company doesn't officially recognize these items and therefore does not train employees to make them as a spokesperson told The Motley Fool. While some baristas may learn the items after repeated orders or through word of mouth you can't just walk up to the counter order a Fruitcake Frappuccino and completely expect the server to know what you want.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhaGVyYWxkLmNvbS92aWV3LnBocD91ZD0yMDIyMTIyNTAwMDA2ONIBOGh0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYWhlcmFsZC5jb20vYW1wL3ZpZXcucGhwP3VkPTIwMjIxMjI1MDAwMDY4?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Starbucks aficionados flock to Seoul’s Gyeongdong Market,"The new Starbucks Kyungdong 1960 located in Seoul’s Gyeongdong Market (Choi Jae-hee / The Korea Herald) The new Starbucks Kyungdong 1960 located in Seoul’s Gyeongdong Market (Choi Jae-hee / The Korea Herald)

A Starbucks neon sign hanging on the wall of an old building emits a soft green glow in the midst of street vendors offering seasonal greens and traditional herbal medicines. Young couples and office workers walk past the food stalls surrounded mostly by elderly shoppers looking for a bargain as they head toward a hidden gem in the marketplace -- a new Starbucks store within Seoul’s Gyeongdong Market that just opened last week. Dubbed “Kyungdong 1960” the new coffee shop is a remodeled version of the Gyeongdong Theater which opened in 1962 and was shut down about 30 years later. The new hangout draws coffee geeks and passersby with its nostalgic 1960s ambiance.

A spot previously occupied by the old theater’s projection screen has been transformed into a counter furnished with kitchen worktops refrigerated deli cases and cash registers. Behind the counter are more than 140 wooden coffee tables and chairs on large steps with ochroleucous light bulbs dangling from the ceiling creating a cozy atmosphere. The 805- square-meter store has some 200 seats on the third and fourth floors of the old theater. A beam projector shoots customers’ purchase order numbers and the nicknames they used on the Starbucks mobile order system high up on a wall in resemblance of an old film’s ending credits.

On Thursday afternoon a number of young visitors armed with selfie sticks were filming vlogs introducing the unique coffee shop while some couples were roaming the place to find Instagrammable photo spots. Yoon Jeong-hye a 23-year-old student at Kyung Hee University who has lived for two years in Dongdaemun-gu where Gyeongdong Market is located said the store seems like a cultural platform that connects young people to the area’s cultural heritage. “This is my first visit to Gyeongdong Market. I had no idea that it was this big and sells all kinds of medical herbs. The new Starbucks store embraces both traditional and modern culture making me become more interested in the neighborhood I’m living in” she said.

With more than a century of history Gyeongdong Market is mostly known for being the No. 1 source of traditional herbal medicines. As part of its corporate social responsibility Starbucks Korea decided to open a new branch by refurbishing the once-abandoned cinema through cooperation with the Gyeongdong Market Merchants Association and the Korean Commissions for Corporate Partnership. “Starbucks’ Kyungdong 1960 branch is a place that all generations can enjoy. We will offer services to promote mutually beneficial relations between new businesses and local communities” a Starbucks official said. To revitalize the traditional market 300 won ($0.23) for every item sold at the new store will be used to run cultural programs such as coffee classes and small music concerts which could draw more young people to the traditional market.

The East Side school stands on the ancestral land of Native people teacher Cassandra Sheppard told students. And the Americas she reminded them were built on slave labor.

""To both the Indigenous and African forebearers we commit to the continued struggle for liberation and reparation for it is through this and through freedom and justice that we truly give honor"" Sheppard said.

With that the day's lesson in critical ethnic studies was under way — an opportunity for students of all races and cultures to better understand themselves and their place in the world. And if they come away empowered advocates say all the better.

Critical ethnic studies is now a graduation requirement for the class of 2025 in St. Paul Public Schools. At Johnson High Principal Jamil Payton sees it as another way to give voice to students at a school with a leadership program built on the premise that ""adults should not do for students what students can do for themselves.""

Developed by district teachers and graduates the course is designed to be student centered and driven said Mouakong Vue the district's ethnic studies coordinator. Conversation is key he said with students not only exploring their own identities but confronting any unconscious biases they may have about others.

There was little in the way of student-to-student discourse during a recent morning devoted in large part to a visit by state Rep. Cedrick Frazier DFL-New Hope.

But Frazier quizzed students on topics such as the landmark segregation case Brown v. Board of Education — he was surprised when a student cited the name of a key player not often referenced in such discussions — and he shared with them his plan to reintroduce a bill incorporating ethnic studies in the state's social studies graduation requirements.

""I believe it's going to become law this year"" Frazier said.

The legislation he proposed during the last session defined ethnic studies as ""the critical and interdisciplinary study of race ethnicity and indigeneity with a focus on the experiences and perspectives of people of color within and beyond the United States.""

Districts and charter schools would determine local priorities for course selection and implementation under the proposal.

Correspondence to House Education Finance Committee members revealed support from several teachers and from St. Paul Public Schools Superintendent Joe Gothard plus groups like Unidos MN and Education Evolving — the latter of which cited research showing that students who take ethnic studies have greater academic engagement and graduation rates.

The bill was opposed by the Minnesota Family Council.

Rebecca Delahunt the council's assistant director of public policy wrote to House members in March that although the history of ethnic minorities including their experiences with racism and discrimination should be taught the lessons should not classify ""students as either oppressor or oppressed depending upon skin color.""

That criticism often is advanced about the similarly titled critical race theory — an academic concept that conservative critics say divides white students and students of color.

Kasia Yang a Hmong student at Johnson High said in an interview following Frazier's appearance that she grew up learning a lot about white history and was surprised to learn in the ethnic studies course how people in power oppressed people of color.

A lot of minority students Yang said have experienced at least one instance of racism — in her case bullying on social media: ""That's why I encourage my siblings to stand up for themselves"" she said.

Josiah Lealem who is Ethiopian said that he and other children of immigrants share the same struggles and that the course has helped him identify the causes and in turn work with others for the community's betterment.

""I can talk about similar experiences with them that I won't be able to talk about with people who are not of color"" he said. ""I'm not saying they're bad. It's just that with people of color you can build connections you know?""

Frazier's visit coincided with Sheppard's lessons and discussions around resistance and liberation groups that felt ignored and wanted their voices heard. He addressed slavery and the Civil War and the subsequent fight by Black people for the right to vote.

There was his personal story too of growing up as one of seven children on the South Side of Chicago and driving through rain and fog with his father to the University of Minnesota Morris. It was the first time he had been on campus and his first extended stay away from home.

""My dad dropped me off and he said 'Hey son good luck. Call me if you need me'"" he said.

He went on to study urban planning and local government management and became a lawyer inspired by Thurgood Marshall's arguments in opposition to segregation.

Frazier told the students: ""It's more important than ever that you are all engaged and you get the resources you need to be educated on issues and you be given the platform and the space to have your voices heard because you are our next leaders.""

As he was wrapping up a student raised his hand.

""I voted for the first time in November"" he said.

""Hey all right"" Frazier replied. ""How did it feel for you to have that opportunity to vote?""

Supermicro MegaDC

Supermicro’s MegasDC servers were launched in 2020 and were designed for use in hyperscale infrastructure deployments. According to Supermicro the MegaDC line was “the first Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) systems designed exclusively for hyperscale datacenters.”

MegaDC servers are purpose-built and flexible and have been optimized for cost-effectiveness and reliability. They also support many open standards including OpenBMC for customized control over functionality and versioning advanced I/O modules (AIOM) that support OCP cards and common redundant power supplies (CRPS) for greater flexibility.

Now with the Ampere-based MegaDC servers Supermicro can target more workloads where ARM servers are gaining traction such as cloud gaming video-on-demand CDN IaaS database object storage dense VDI and telco edge solutions.

Supermicro MegaDC Ampere Servers

Supermicro is currently showing four servers available as part of the R12 generation of MegaDC servers. The new product line includes servers with a single Ampere Altra or Altra Max CPU in either a 1U or 2U form factor with up to four double-width GPUs or up to 24x 2.5″ U.2 NVMe hot-swappable drives.

The servers also feature an onboard redundant 25GbE SFP28 Ethernet networking using NVIDIA Mellanox CX4 and have been certified for use in enterprise and edge applications in temperatures up to 35°C (95°F) and 55°C (131°F) respectively. The use of highly efficient air cooling allows these servers to operate in a wide range of temperature environments.

According to Ivan Tay SVP of Product Management at Supermicro the expansion of the company’s product line with ARM-based servers using Ampere processors gives customers even more choices for their specific workloads. The Building Block design of the MegaDC servers allows for a single socket motherboard to be paired with an Ampere Altra or Altra Max CPU with up to 128 cores per server up to 4TB of DDR4 memory and modular design options for maximum I/O PCIe and storage.

Market Impact

The race is on to deliver ARM-based servers to the market. HPE has launched Ampere-based servers along with others and just recently a new entrant to the market launched with a RISC-V offering. There’s clearly momentum to explore alternatives to x86 not only in the cloud (AWS loves Graviton) but in the enterprise as well.

In this case Supermicro is applying its manufacturing strength to deliver to hyperscalers more or less preconfigured solutions that will go head to head with the likes of Inspur and WiWynn who also compete with Ampere offerings for hyperscalers. There’s clearly a lot of appetite for Ampere and room for many to deliver these solutions which are well-suited for the burgeoning world of cloud-native applications.

That’s what just about half of retired Americans are doing according to a survey by Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM). The good news is if you’re in your 20s 30s even 40s you’ve got time to make adjustments so you can live more comfortably when you retire.

The first thing is to start saving for retirement now.

Will millennials even get Social Security?

Plenty of millennials are worried that Social Security the federal government's insurance program that provides income to retirees may not survive until they reach retirement.

It’s a simple math problem. Fewer people are paying into the system because of a drop in the birth rate and more people are taking benefits now because of the baby boom. That will have a disastrous impact on future payouts.

In its annual report the Social Security Administration said that after 2035 it expects to pay only 80% of the benefits currently scheduled for that period.

That means that a 35-year-old who earns $50000 in 2022 will receive on average $17370 less in Social Security income annually and $365000 less over a lifetime"" according to research house Healthview Services. For people making more than $150000 a year that's a $677000 loss over a lifetime.

Not enough income to save

Millennials and members of Gen Z are far more likely than Gen Xers to say their main source of income is not enough to pay bills and save for the future. Many go into debt or receive financial support from relatives according to Prudential Financial’s latest retirement survey.

Half of millennials say they regularly run out of money and need to use credit cards or turn to family for financial support and 65% of millennials and Gen Z have received financial support in the past two years from either parents significant others relatives or grandparents Prudential found. Inadequate salary paired with competing financial priorities is especially acute among black Hispanic and female workers.

Unless millennials start planning for their long-term financial security the outlook is bleak. GSAM reported that 35% of millennials said they're behind schedule on retirement savings.

How to get started

The No. 1 recommendation: define goals develop a financial plan then determine cash-flow needs to see how much you can put away says Shurdonna Joseph director of high-net-worth consulting at Janney Montgomery Scott.

The very first step is paying off any money you owe. Debt including student debt prevents just over half from accomplishing goals such as owning a home and having kids according to Prudential. Part of the problem is 70% of millennials don't keep a formal budget and 38% don't invest.

“Without keeping an eye on finances it can be easy for good spending and savings habits to slip"" Brandon Goldstein a financial planner with Prudential Financial said in a release. A millennial himself he agrees it can be tough to balance financial responsibility while maintaining a social life.

Saving early makes a difference

The most important asset millennials have is time for accounts to grow and compound.

They also have three savings vehicles baby boomers didn't have when the oldest among them started their work lives: the 401(k) plan a Roth individual retirement account (IRA) and the Simplified Employee Pension IRA (SEP-IRA).

""We recommend investors save 12% to 15% of their income for retirement"" said Maria Bruno head of U.S. wealth planning research at Vanguard. If 12% is not possible Bruno recommends saving as much as you can and increasing it every year.

The difference between putting away 6% of salary at 25 and increasing it annually by one percentage point until it hits 15% and starting to save 15% at 40 is enormous. Starting early will result in the 25-year-old saving $1 million more according to fund giant T. Rowe Price.

Take advantage of that 401(k)

The 401(k) plan is offered by for-profit companies. Employees contribute a percentage of each paycheck pre-tax into their account. A good idea is to turn up the auto increase function by 1% a year.

The money grows on a tax-deferred basis and the person pays taxes when they withdraw the money. People under 50 can contribute a maximum of $20500 this year and $22500 in 2023. Once you turn 50 you’re eligible to make catchup contributions of an additional $6500 per year in 2022 and $7500 in 2023.

Roth Individual Retirement Account

In a Roth IRA you contribute after-tax dollars and you pay no taxes when the money is withdrawn. A traditional IRA uses pre-tax dollars and you pay taxes when the money is withdrawn. The total annual contribution for both the Roth and traditional IRA is $6000 this year and $6500 in 2023. People over age 50 can contribute an additional $1000 per year (this will not increase in 2023).

Simplified Employee Pension Plan IRA (SEP-IRA)

What if you don't work for a company? The Simplified Employee Pension IRA (SEP-IRA) is available to self-employed entrepreneurs and small-business owners. SEP contributions are tax deductible. The individual pays taxes when the funds are withdrawn. A big advantage is the much higher maximum annual contribution: $61000 in 2022 and $66000 in 2023. SEP-IRAs do not have catchup contributions.

With automotive innovations including CASE and MaaS drawing attention in recent years automobile manufacturers have been engaged in research and development activities on automated driving systems and driving assistance systems. They are also conducting demonstration tests in many parts of Japan with the goal of commercial implementation of automated driving technology. A type of automated driving technology that is becoming the mainstream involves a sensing technology called LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). LiDAR allows automated driving of a vehicle by detecting obstacles and localizing the position of the vehicle using map matching. However LiDAR cannot quickly recognize dark-colored objects such as asphalt roads. Nippon Paint’s Target Line Paint enables LiDAR to recognize dark color such as paint used on asphalt road surface by using a technology that controls the intensity of reflection according to the wavelength of light.

Target Line Paint enables LiDAR to recognize objects in any location





GPS connection instability that affects the recognition and accuracy of map matching of LiDAR is a problem for automated driving. Instability can occur below roadside trees under bridges and in areas where scenery is monotonous such as inside tunnels. Our Target Line Paint is designed to be easily recognized from LiDAR. As a result this product can be used in any location such as roads and guardrails without impairing LiDAR’s sensitivity. In areas where the scenery does not change such as inside tunnels the accuracy of map matching can be improved by marking the road at regular intervals by utilizing the characteristics of paint.

Paint that is not easily noticeable to people but can be recognized by LiDAR even in dark colors Conspicuous marks on roads and guardrails can be confused with important pavement markings or be unsightly in scenic areas. LiDAR is not sensitive to black or dark colors but Target Line Paint can be recognized by LiDAR even in these colors. As a result this paint can be used on asphalt roads and dark-colored guard fences by selecting colors of a similar shade.

Lowering the cost of infrastructure projects The Japanese government is creating a roadmap to increase the use of automated driving vehicles in Japan. However the practical application of automated driving vehicles is costly because it requires technology upgrades for vehicles as well as for roads and other infrastructure to improve the driving environment.

Applying Target Line Paint on roads and guardrails can help create the infrastructure required for automated driving. Furthermore this product can reduce the cost construction time and maintenance of this infrastructure. Due to its characteristics Target Line Paint can be used in a wide range of places and objects. This versatility makes it suitable for meeting requirements for automated driving technologies and other elements of the transition to a smart society.

Activities for commercialization

We are currently conducting demonstration tests using Target Line Paint with various companies in many locations in Japan.



The Nippon Paint Group will continue to develop products that can contribute to solving issues in the paint and coatings industry and revitalizing the market with the goal of addressing social challenges through its paint and coatings technology.

An important proof-point we consider when evaluating the competitive advantage of any business is whether margins can be maintained (or expanded) especially during periods of inflation. In addition Toro continues to see robust demand for its professional and residential products. The Company has a backlog in its professional segment that is at its highest level since the year began whereas residential products grew +7% on strong year and 2-year comparisons and despite many “home” categories across big-box retailers witnessing declines.

From the Company’s humble beginning building tractor engines for the Bull Tractor Company in Bloomington Milwaukee the Company has methodically grown into the diversified conglomerate of today that possesses industry leading brand awareness market share technological prowess and profitability.

“Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. was the first stock Michael recommended to us shortly after he joined Baron Capital in 2003. Dick’s share price has since increased about nine-fold. Unfortunately we sold our investment in Dick’s about six years ago and although it was a successful investment we did not realize the full benefit of Michael’s recommendation. We sold too soon because I was concerned that competition from internet retailers would have a permanent negative impact on Dick’s stores’ profitability. I was wrong. Dick’s stock price so far has about doubled after we sold…and its prospects have brightened! We sold even though we considered Ed Stack Dick’s Chairm”n and CEO a terrific retailer a great entrepreneur and a special person. Ed had built Dick’s from three bait and tackle stores his dad started into a uniquely positioned nationwide chain of 730 sporting goods stores. In fact Dick’s is now the largest nationwide sporting goods chain. Ed had purchased the three bait and tackle stores the foundation of Dick’s business from his dad. Ed’s mother loaned him the money to buy his dad’s stores! I’m not exactly sure what that signifies. But it may have something to do with Carl Icahn’s proclamation that “everything I have is for sale except my children…and maybe my wife.” Ed and his newly appointed CEO Lauren Hobart visited us last month. Ed asked for the meeting to introduce us to Lauren as well as to discuss the prospects for Dick’s new large format stores with attached outdoor student athletic fields. Lauren then described how well its new format stores were doing in two smaller communities. We also spoke about the successes of Dick’s omni-channel retailing efforts and how desirable Dick‘s stores have become to shopping centers trying to lure shoppers to return to their malls.”

Domenick Nati a radio host in Virginia was trying to charge his Tesla Model S last Friday ahead of his holiday travel but he was having some issues.

It was reportedly 19°F – or -7°C – at the time.

Nati claims to have first tried to charge at home without success and then he tried at a local Supercharger station where he posted this video on TikTok that went viral:

When plugged into the Supercharger the car showed a message saying that it was warming up the battery pack in preparation for charging but it never actually started to charge – even an hour later.

Nati claims to have reached out to Tesla about the issue but he couldn’t get a response by Saturday.

Electrek’s Take

The video and media reports on it are creating some confusion. Some are associating this with the normal problems charging in the cold.

First off it’s true that electric vehicle charging is affected by colder temperatures but this is not normal.

It takes time for the battery pack to warm up enough to accept higher charge rates. That’s why Tesla built in a feature that enables the battery pack to condition itself for charging ahead of time if you enter a charge point in the navigation system.

So yes there are issues with charging in colder temperatures but this is not it – this is a malfunction with this gentleman’s specific vehicle.

I have charged Tesla vehicles and other EVs at way colder temperatures than -7°C without issue. It’s unfortunate but it looks to be a problem with the owner’s specific car than hopefully is going to be covered by the warranty.

The biggest highlight if anything is that he couldn’t get in touch with anyone at Tesla for a remote diagnostic. That’s a big issue with Tesla’s service. It’s hard to get someone on the phone."

DOE launched this challenge because according to the program’s fact sheet “additional efforts are needed to address common technical and market barriers to wider adoption by consumers – which include performance at temperatures of 5F and below installation challenges and electricity grid impacts during peak demand periods.”

DOE is working with manufacturers to lab test cold climate heat pumps’ performance. Field testing will take place over the next couple years and DOE is aiming for commercialization in 2024.

Besides Johnson Controls other manufacturers such as Carrier Trane and Bosch are also taking part in the challenge.

Trane successfully completed its lab testing phase required by the heat pump challenge in early November and moved into the field trials phase. Katie Davis vice president of engineering and technology Residential HVAC Trane Technologies told Contracting Business in December that “there are no products in the market that currently meet the DOE CCHP Challenge performance specifications.” However Davis said:

When tested at the DOE’s lab the Oak Ridge National Lab Facility Trane’s CCHP prototype performed in temperatures as low as -23F surpassing the mandatory -20F Fahrenheit DOE requirement.

There are already units on the market in the United States that work at low temperatures – just not as low as the Johnson Controls or Trane prototypes. Johnson Controls currently has two residential heat pumps on the US market – the York YZV and York HMH7 – that can operate at temperatures as low as 5F (-15C). (Johnson Controls bought York in August 2005.) And Trane’s Platinum XV20i can operate at temperatures as low as 0F.

Corporate monopolies exercise a lot of power in U.S. markets.

They dominate many industries including beef.

“You have cattle ranchers going broke while consumers are paying all-time record prices for beef” Bill Bullard head of the Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund says.

In ways you see and don’t:

Part I

MEGHNA CHAKRABARTI: There’s a small Montana town that’s as small as it gets population 110 to be exact. No stores or restaurants. The only business in town is the Post Office. But it does have lots of grassland. And …

JEANIE ALDERSON: In a state like Montana there’s more cows than people.

(Credit: Northern Plains Resource Council)

CHAKRABARTI: Jeanie Alderson is a fourth generation rancher. She grew up in that tiny town Birney in southeastern Montana.

ALDERSON: We’re on our ranch today. It’s at the confluence of two creeks which is really special that means we’ve got water. This is the high northern plains kind of terrain. Wonderful grasslands but it’s dry.

CHAKRABARTI: Jeanie’s family has owned the Bones Brothers Ranch since 1889. More than 130 years.

ALDERSON: Ranching is what this community is and it’s who we are.

CHAKRABARTI: She’s wondering though how long will it stay that way? Ever since Jeanie took over the family business she’s seen things change and rapidly.

ALDERSON: You know when I was growing up there were two little grocery stores in this town and now all you can buy in Birney is a stamp.

CHAKRBARTI: This is On Point. I’m Meghna Chakrabarti. Ranchers like Jeanie are so integral to the western United States they’re indistinguishable from it. But there are half a million fewer ranching families now. That’s 40% less than there were in the 1980s. That’s partly because of a long-term change mostly hidden from public view in the structure of the beef industry. To consumers it looks like a pretty open market. A lot of ranchers selling a lot of beef that ends up in a lot of grocery stores.

But the beef industry is really more like an hourglass. Between the ranchers and the shoppers there’s an iron fist consolidating and squeezing the meatpacking market down to a virtual monopoly. That heavily influences prices paid to ranchers for their cattle. So more than ever ranchers like Jeanie Alderson are having a hard time hanging on.

ALDERSON: Agriculture has always been the hub the center the heart. And when you look around these little communities and you see all the boarded up businesses you realize that when ranching and farming are on hard times it’s hard on all the other businesses and all the communities around that.

CHAKRABARTI: All the communities around that. Well for more than 50 years American antitrust regulation has followed a basic premise: Are consumers being harmed? But now there’s a new sheriff in town and her name is Lina Khan. She’s the chair of the Federal Trade Commission and Khan wants to rethink the entire definition of harm when it comes to monopolies.

LINA KHAN [Tape]: Monopolies are bad not simply because they threaten to you know lead to higher consumer prices or even necessarily undermine productivity and growth. But monopolies are bad because they’re bad for democracy.

CHAKRABARTI: Today we’re launching a weeklong special series called More than money: The cost of monopolies in America. And we’ll be exploring the idea of whether it’s time to look more closely at what monopolistic consolidation does not only to the markets those companies are in but to the societies they’re into.

CHAKRABARTI: Jeanie Alderson runs the Bones Brothers Ranch with her husband her two teenage sons and her 91-year-old father. He raised the cattle before her.

ALDERSON: Well we’re feeding a bunch of our wagyu beef cattle. And we feed them in the wintertime and they’re out on pastures all summer. And today we bought them some hay. They’re happy to have it.

ALDERSON: In many ways I belong to this place kind of more than it belongs to me and that’s something that’s sort of hard to explain. But I feel this immense responsibility to care for it and to hold it together.

ALDERSON: So we love this. This is our solar well water our cattle and get drinking water sometimes if we lose power at the ranch.

(Credit: Northern Plains Resource Council)

You know when I was growing up I don’t remember thinking about Are we going to get a big enough sale to pay all our bills and stay in business? That is looming more and more.

CHAKRABARTI: There are four major corporations in the American meatpacking industry. Tyson Foods Cargill and two owned by Brazilian corporations National Beef Packing Company and JBS. In 1977 the Big Four as they’re commonly called owned just 25% of the market. Many mergers later the Big Four now control 85% of all meat packing in America. Cattle beef are a $67 billion industry in the U.S.

Cattle ranchers used to receive 62 cents for every consumer dollar spent on beef. Today that’s dropped to less than 37 cents on the dollar. Meanwhile the Big Four have tripled profits in the past two years alone.

ALDERSON: I’m just using a pitchfork to throw a little bit of hay for these horses. They’ll mostly graze but I just give them a little extra.

CHAKRABARTI: By controlling almost the entire meatpacking market the Big Four exercised enormous leverage over prices they’ll pay for livestock.

ALDERSON: We wait for a middleman to come and say OK I’m going to give you such and such price for your calves. It’s not like we get to set the price. We are given a price and we have to take it or leave it. It’s stressful because we know how much we have to make on a calf. But we also because of where we live in the wintertime we could say OK we can’t get a good enough price. We’ll just keep them and we’ll sell them. The next year we’ll sell them as yearlings. But then we have all these costs of feeding them all through the winter. And who knows if the market’s going to be any better the next year? We’re really trapped in this system. We don’t have another place to go. That’s the other thing that I think a lot of people don’t understand. We don’t have another market to go to.

CHAKRABARTI: There was a time and a place where cattle markets were much more competitive dynamic and transparent: At the public auction.

Today less than 30% of cattle sales passed through the typical cash auction. The rest go through contract sales with the Big Four meatpackers. Jeanie Alderson says that means the company’s lock up 70% of cattle sold at prices they impose and they do so out of public view.

ALDERSON: There’s this huge amount of wealth that’s being extracted from the cattle that we’re raising and they’re kind of being stolen from us. And we’re not asking for a lot. We’re really just asking for a fair and open and transparent market some competition in the market and for some laws to be enforced.

CHAKRABARTI: And what if that doesn’t happen? What if the Big Four meatpackers further consolidate into the big three two or one?

ALDERSON: We’re not going to have the kind of ranching that we know now. If we don’t change things we’re just not going to have these ranches. … And that’s such a huge cost to all of us in this country.

CHAKRABARTI: Jeanie Alderson. She’s a fourth generation rancher at the Bones Brothers Ranch in Birney Montana. She’s also a member of the Northern Plains Resource Council a grassroots conservation and family agriculture group.

Well let’s turn now to Bill Bullard. He heads the advocacy group Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund. He’s also a former rancher and he joins us from Billings Montana. Bill welcome to the show.

BILL BULLARD: Hello Meghna.

CHAKRABARTI: So there’s a lot to dig into. Because I really want to help listeners understand as much as they can about how the beef industry works you know from ranch to dinner table. So first of all can you give us a picture of where we are now? Number of head of cattle in the United States number of ranches et cetera? How would you describe that?

BULLARD: Well we have about 729000 independent cattle producers to ranchers left in the United States and that’s a decline from 1.3 million head just a few decades ago. Today we have six million head fewer cattle in our cattle herd than we had in just the four decades ago. And so our industry is shrinking. And one of the marketing outlets that’s critically important to ranchers like Jeanie is the cattle feeding sector. And we’ve lost 75% of all the independent cattle feeders in this industry just since 1996.

And so that’s in about 25 years. And so the entire industry is contracting at an alarming rate and that’s because the government has de-emphasized the family farm and ranch system of agriculture that is a disaggregated system and has earned the envy of the entire world for producing an abundant affordable and safe food supply.

And instead there’s been catering to the large corporate agribusinesses in pursuing the largeness of scale. And as a result we’ve seen these monopolistic structures within the industry that’s essentially purged competition from throughout the entire industry. And that’s why you could say that cattle producers are dropping like flies right now. We’re losing our competitive infrastructure within the entire marketing system. And if something isn’t done very very quickly we’ll soon reach the point of no return as Jeanie indicated.

CHAKRABARTI: And when you say if something isn’t done very quickly I mean how quickly are you talking about? I mean if we look five 10 years into the future what do you see?

BULLARD: Way too late. We’ve got to do something this year. We’ve got to restore competition. Because there are ranchers that are going bankrupt that are selling out. We’ve got additional feedlots that are closing their doors. And once you lose the competitive infrastructure it’s game over for the entire industry. And we’ll look like the hog industry where 90% of all the producers in business just 40 years ago are gone today. And that’s because the corporate agribusinesses have essentially controlled that industry from birth to plate as they have in the poultry industry.

So the ranching industry is the last frontier and meaningful reforms need to be implemented immediately or we will soon become as Jeanie said unlike what we know the ranching industry today. It will be completely different.

CHAKRABARTI: When we come back we’re going to talk a lot more about exactly what the choke points are where this consolidation is happening most rapidly in the beef and ranching industry. Today is part one of our special weeklong series called More than money: The cost of monopolies in America. We’ll have more when we come back.

Part II

CHAKRABARTI: This is On Point I’m Meghna Chakrabarti. And today is part one of our special week-long series that we’re calling More than money: The cost of monopolies in America where we’re taking a look at the idea now championed by the chair of the Federal Trade Commission that monopolistic business practice isn’t just bad for consumers but it may be bad for American democracy. So that’s what we’re taking a look at over the course of this week.

And today we’re focusing in on what’s happening right now in the American beef industry specifically. All the way from cattle ranchers to what happens in the supermarket. And I’m joined today by Bill Bullard. He heads the advocacy group the Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund. And they brought a class action lawsuit against meatpackers in America and we’ll talk about that in just a minute. So Bill tell me a little bit more. Let’s get a good understanding of how the process works right now. So the ranchers raise the cattle and then where do the cattle go next?

BULLARD: Well there are several segments of the live cattle supply chain. So ranchers like Jeanie will raise a calf off of the mother cows that she will care for throughout the year. And that calf would be sold perhaps by Jeanie in the fall. Weighing between 400 or 500 pounds. It would then move to an intermediary segment of the industry that will grow that calf for several more months maybe another six months. And then the calf will ultimately weigh 800 to 900 pounds [and] would be brought to the feedlot sector of the industry. And that’s where the animal is fed the concentrated diet gains weight at a very fast pace. And then when the animal weighs approximately 1300 pounds it will be sold directly to the packers. And as you indicated there’s four packers controlling 85% of that market.

CHAKRABARTI: Let’s talk a little bit then about how Tyson Cargill National Beef Packing Company and JBS became the dominant force in the meatpacking industry. Wasn’t it about I don’t know 40-ish years ago that it was a lot more distributed across the United States? Because it was just back in the 1980s as I said earlier that they had what 25% of the industry. So how did that change so rapidly?

BULLARD: Well that’s because the corporate agribusinesses went to Congress and the executive branch and convinced them that what the American family farm and ranch system could do well they could do better. And so they pursued this ideal of largeness of scale. The larger the enterprise the greater the efficiency and the more consistent the quality. And as a result we began losing hundreds of thousands of cattle producers all across the country. Because there was a paradigm shift in the laws and regulations and policies that provide the framework of this industry. And those laws and regulations and policies catered to the interests of the multinational meatpackers. To the disadvantage of the producers the cattle producers as well as to the consumers.

CHAKRABARTI: Well there is though a law speaking of laws and regulations that’s been on the books since 1921 right? The Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921. And if I read that properly this is a law it’s century-old now that was supposed to keep exactly the kind of consolidation we’re talking about well below 40%.

BULLARD: That’s right it went beyond what our U.S. antitrust laws did. Because not only did it prohibit monopolistic practices in the industry but it was designed to protect the interests the financial interests of actual farmers and ranchers. It was designed to ensure that the meat packers would not engage in deceptive or discriminatory or unfair practices against producers. As well as that the packers would not provide undue preferences or advantages to some of the feedlot sectors to the disadvantage of others. In other words if they’re given sweetheart deals to some of the largest formula feeders cattle feeders that have close alliances with the packers. And that’s why we’ve seen our smaller independent family-sized feedlots go by the wayside. We’ve lost over 83000 of them in just 25 years.

CHAKRABARTI: But tell me more though. I mean ostensibly when we have a law that’s on the books that says consolidation shouldn’t go above 40% and then it skyrockets from 25% in the early 80s to 85% 40 years later something has gone wrong regarding regulatory enforcement.

BULLARD: Well that’s right there is lack of enforcement. In fact the U.S. Department of Agriculture that was charged with implementing and administering the Packers and Stockyards Act never even wrote rules to clarify what Congress meant by protecting producers against unfair and deceptive and discriminatory practices. And so the packers were left to operate with impunity in the marketplace. And the Packers and Stockyards Act was not enforced.

CHAKRABARTI: OK so tell me a little bit more. Again for people who aren’t familiar with this. In the first segment we talked about how the belief among cattle ranchers what you’re seeing now is that because of this pinch point in the middle of the process with the four big meatpackers — And by the way we did reach out to Tyson Cargill National Beef Packing Company and JBS. They did not get back to us.

Bill how is it that you say that they’re able to essentially set prices? Clarify that.

BULLARD: Well because of the dominant market position that they enjoy in the cattle industry they can act as gatekeepers to the market. And they can decide who does and who does not have timely access to the market. And as a result they can provide preferences to their large closely aligned feedlots. And completely deprive the independent cattle feeder of the same types of prices and terms in terms of selling cattle. So that’s one way that they were able to. The other way is they’ve implemented new cattle procurement tools tools with which to purchase cattle.

And what they’ve done is they’ve shifted large volumes of cattle out of the competitive cash market which is the industry’s price discovery market. And they place those cattle in underpriced forward contracts. We call those captive supplies. The industry wants to call them alternative marketing arrangements because they sound better. The fact of the matter is is they are the instrument of choice by the packers to leverage down the cattle prices that they pay to U.S. producers. And that’s exactly what’s happened in our industry.

CHAKRABARTI: How much have they been able to leverage it down?

BULLARD: Well consumers need to know that they are paying super inflated prices for beef today in the grocery store. And yet cattle producers continue to receive seriously depressed prices. And so they have depressed prices from $167 per hundred weight for an animal down to we were as low as $100 per hundred weight within the last few years. And very recently cattle prices have started to increase. Now up to around $140 per hundred weight.

But very importantly based on USDA data that means the independent feeder has over the past seven years has lost on average $69 per head of every animal they fed and sold to the packers. So that explains why we’ve lost so many independent feeders. And so what’s happened in the industry is the consumers are being exploited on one end of the supply chain and cattle producers are being exploited on the other end. And as you indicated the middlemen are making record profits.

CHAKRABARTI: You know I’m looking at a USDA chart here. And it’s like a visual representation of what you exactly described there Bill. That from 2010 to roughly 2015 in a sense the price that ranchers got per hundred weight and the price of beef in the consumer market kind of tracked pretty closely. But then starting in 2015 we have this giant divergence just like crashing of cattle prices. And a steady and then rising rate for the price of beef. So it’s that divergence that’s driving the ranchers out of business is what you’re talking about.

BULLARD: That’s right there’s always been a harmonious synchronous relationship between beef prices and cattle. And that makes sense because the only ingredient in beef is cattle. But after 2015 we saw cattle prices inexplicably collapse for over a year. And we saw it beginning in 2017 we saw these two price points moving in absolutely opposite directions. We saw consumer beef prices rising to all-time record highs. And at the same time we saw cattle prices stair stepping downward. And that indicates that competition has been purged from the entire live cattle supply chain.

CHAKRABARTI: And you’re saying that the delta goes into the profit of the Big Four.

BULLARD: The meatpackers are making all-time record margins and have been for many years. While cattle producers are struggling just to receive the cost of production from the marketplace. Many are failing to do so. Meanwhile consumers continue to pay these super inflated prices for beef.

CHAKRABARTI: So I want to get your response to some of the things that the meatpacking industry has said in response to these criticisms. Again just want to remind everyone we did reach out to Tyson Cargill National Beef Packing Co. and JBS. Did not hear back from them. But there has been a lot of testimony on Capitol Hill about this. Shane Miller is group president of Tyson Fresh Meats and he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in July of just last year. And here’s how he answered a question from Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley about that meat packing company profit-taking.

SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY [Tape]: Cattle producers struggle to break even receiving average bids of approximately $118 per hundred weight. The gross packer market exceeded $1000 per head. How do you justify making such low bids when you’re turning such a significant profit?

SHANE MILLER: What we pay Iowa cattle feeders truly depends on the market conditions. But how they end up deciding to sell their cattle whether they want to negotiate or put them on an AMA is totally up to them.

CHAKRABARTI: So Bill Bullard the AMA there he’s mentioning being that alternative meat market. He’s saying that the ranchers the cattlemen and women out there have a choice.

BULLARD: And they certainly do not and that’s because of the perishable nature of cattle. Once cattle have reached that optimum weight of approximately 1300 pounds there’s a narrow window of opportunity to sell those animals and it’s about a two to three week window. If you go beyond that the animal begins to degrade in quality and the cattle feeder is uneconomically continuing to feed those cattle they become overweight and the cattle producer loses money. Now the meatpackers know this and they have a tremendous bargaining advantage over the independent producer.

Because again you have four packers acting as gatekeepers. They can decide who does and who does not have timely access to the marketplace so they create market access risk for producers. And of course in our lawsuit we’ve alleged that the meatpackers have conspired to reduce the slaughter volume in order to balance supply and demand. To ensure that there is never more demand for cattle than there is in available supply.

And we talk about these AMAs because what happens when the meatpackers shift cattle out of the cash market and when they avoid the cash market they back up cattle that the independent cattle feeders feeding. And that incentivizes that feeder to do one of two things. Either to sell for a low low price or jump into one of these AMAs in order to gain timely access to the marketplace regardless of what the price is going to be. Because no price is determined at the time of the transaction.

CHAKRABARTI: Yeah. You know the meatpackers say that basically the problem isn’t the consolidation and their market dominance. The problem is all of these other factors that are out of their control. I mean for example here is Dustin Aherin. He’s now director of strategy at Tyson Fresh Meats. June of last year he was with Rabo AgriFinance. And that month he testified before the Senate Ag Committee on what he says really drives cattle prices in the U.S.

DUSTIN AHERIN [Tape]: A working market sends price signals to adjust. These same price signals created record high cattle prices and record packer losses in 2014 and 2015. The biology and natural time delays of the beef industry make it slow-moving and capital intensive adjustments take years. While recent unforeseen events have exacerbated the situation free market signals economic losses drought and the natural cattle cycle laid the foundation for today’s circumstances over several decades.

CHAKRABARTI: What’s your response to that Bill?

BULLARD: Well what’s missing here is that we do not have consumers sending demand signals upstream in the beef supply chain. And they cannot because there is no indication as to the country of origin on the beef. And without that country of origin label the meatpackers can substitute imported products from over 20 countries and displace the American cattle producers access to their own domestic market. And that’s what we’ve seen. Because we cannot have consumers indicating that they want cattle produced from American cattle producers. The meatpackers have been free to import large quantities of beef and cattle from foreign countries such as Namibia Africa Costa Rica Honduras Nicaragua Argentina Brazil Canada Mexico and pass that off to unsuspecting consumers. But the effect of that is … to reduce demand for domestic cattle and that reduced demand in the competitive cash market is what helps drive the prices down.

CHAKRABARTI: Well here’s the outcome of some of this. We also talked to Aaron Metz of Wishek North Dakota. He’s a fourth generation rancher and he and his wife are selling their cattle herd off today.

AARON METZ: It hasn’t really hit me hard yet because the cows are still here. But on Monday when they go … I don’t know what’s going to happen to me. I’ll probably fall apart. When you see years and years of genetics that you have worked for. You have froze for. You have sweated for. You have bled for. Going down the road is … heart wrenching.

CHAKRABARTI: Aaron says that this was one of the hardest decisions he’s ever had to make. But when he sat down and ran the numbers last month he realized he could not afford to own the cows anymore.

METZ: Where I’m sitting right now I’m looking out my window. And I can see my barn. And up on my barn is my brand. My brand was my grandpa’s in the family 120 years that one brand. And my plan was to pass it on to my son. And when you look at that brand that’s the symbol of the legacy of my family. My grandpa came over here on a ship from Germany. You know he homesteaded 16-years-old. So that tells you a lot about the people that are doing this and the heritage that’s behind it. It’s kind of a sad deal to even sit here and look [at] it. Because that might not be in the family much longer.

CHAKRABARTI: That brand he’s talking about by the way is the symbol of the Green Lake Angus Ranch. And Aaron told us ranching is all he and his family know. But he thinks that by the end of this year all of that’s going to change.

METZ: Once the cows are gone and we have a production sale in March decision has to come. What’s next? Do we sell the land off and move to town? Or do we stay here and scale? You know just do a hobby deal and still work in town? Or do we just just go a whole different direction? There’s a lot of tough decisions to be made. You know at this point it’s kind of looking like we’re going to probably end up going and getting a job somewhere. Whether we live on the farm place and we do something with the land or whatever it’s kind of looking like we’re going to town. You know it shouldn’t be that way where you have to leave your place to make a living. You should be able to make a fair enough living off of your farm or ranch to take care of your family. It should just be that way. Things have really really changed in the last 30 some odd years.

CHAKRABARTI: Fourth generation rancher Aaron Metz in North Dakota. When we come back we’re going to be talking about some solutions and the pushback against the monopolization in the beef industry. This is On Point.

Part III

CHAKRABARTI: Today is day one of our special weeklong series that we’re calling More than money: The cost of monopolies in America where we’re taking a look at this idea now championed by the chair of the FTC Lina Khan that monopolies in America don’t just harm consumers they harm democracy.

And so today in part one we’re taking a close look at the radical and rapid changes that have happened in the beef industry in the past 40 years and what impact that’s having on ranchers consumers and also more broadly on democracy. And Bill Bullard joins us. He’s head of the advocacy group the Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund. Also a former rancher himself is with us from Billings Montana. And I want to play a little bit of tape from just last month because this issue has gone all the way to the White House. Here’s President Biden at a virtual roundtable with farmers and ranchers in January.

PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN [Tape]: Back in July I signed an executive order to promote competition across the economy. And too many industries a handful of giant companies dominate the market. And too often they use their power to squeeze out smaller competitors and stifle new entrepreneurs making our economy less dynamic giving themselves free rein to raise prices reduce options for consumers or exploit workers. The meat industry is a textbook example on the price side. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. Capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism it’s exploitation.

CHAKRABARTI: President Biden just last month. The Biden administration has proposed better enforcement around things like the Packers and Stockyards Act that we talked about. And $1 billion to expand independent meat processing capacity. And $100 million to support hiring the workers that would be needed for an increased number of meat packing facilities. Will it make a difference Bill?

BULLARD: The problem is that you do not first address the abuse of market power being exercised in the marketplace today. We’re likely to see a repeat of the ’80s which was considered a merger mania decade. And that’s because the meatpackers used their leverage in order to force all of the local and regional packing plants out. So having more packing plants will increase capacity. And some will survive but some are going to be subjected to the same kind of monopolistic-type conduct in the marketplace. Unless we first aggressively enforce the antitrust laws the Packers and Stockyards Act. And in fact this crisis is so severe it’s now become a national food security issue. And Congress needs to act decisively in order to immediately restore competition to the industry.

CHAKRABARTI: OK so specifically then what would that mean? I mean you have a lawsuit working its way through the courts now. But ideally enforcement could come independent of that.

BULLARD: Well that’s right. And for ranchers like Aaron it’s too late. And his story is being replicated all across the United States. And as I said earlier we’ll soon reach the point of no return. And so lawsuits take a long time. Congress needs to act decisively. They know there’s a problem. The president has identified the problem and articulated it. Congress needs to act right now to prevent any further ranchers from having to exit the industry simply because the marketplace is fundamentally and systemically broken. Because the regulators have not enforced antitrust laws or the Packers and Stockyards Act for decades.

CHAKRABARTI: Well as I said we did speak with the North American Meat Institute. They represent a lot of meatpackers. And spokeswoman Sarah Little told us that the Meat Institute does not think that the Biden plan or the additional $1 billion of government funding to expand meat packing capacity doesn’t think that that will work.

SARAH LITTLE: The first problem with spending that money to invest in extra capacity is Is it sustainable? Where will they get the labor to operate this new capacity given the nationwide labor shortage? What will happen is they will create too much packing capacity and we will not have enough cattle to run through those facilities. The herd size is shrinking. USDA reports each month on the herd inventory in America. And it has been consistently falling. So we’re just saying that the new capacity supported by the government is not the answer to better prices for livestock producers.

CHAKRABARTI: That’s Sarah Little a spokeswoman for the North American Meat Institute. … [Joining us now] is Claire Kelloway program manager for fair food and farming systems at the Open Markets Institute. She’s with us from Minneapolis.

… First of all I mean just respond quickly to what you heard Sarah Little say. It sounds like they’re asserting that it’s not at all capacity or an expansion of capacity that will solve the problem. What do you think?

CLAIRE KELLOWAY: I mean … what kind of capacity are you talking about? I think the system that we currently have proved very fragile. And we do see that large meat packers when they don’t face sufficient competition don’t have that incentive to invest in their capacity and critically invest in resiliency and have backups and contingency plans. They both as Bill has been talking about have an incentive for there not to be a lot of excess processing capacity. So they can really control the supply of cattle. But they also are under a quite restrictive system that is really focused on operating at full capacity all the time. And what we’ve seen is a resilient meat supply system really requires a diversity of both scale and some large plants. But also large plants owned by multiple packers and more medium-sized plants that can fill in when some of these large plants go down.

CHAKRABARTI: Yeah. So it’s interesting to me. Because this consolidation in the middle of that supply chain between ranchers and the grocery store was allowed to happen right? I mean we went from that 25% among the Big Four to the 85% it was allowed to happen. And how different is that Claire if at all from … other types of food poultry pork?

KELLOWAY: Yeah the beef packing industry is certainly more consolidated than pork and chicken. They obviously all have slightly different supply chains but there definitely has been an overall trend across meat processing and food processing generally towards consolidation. Sort of aligned with when merger policy was really less restricted and more mergers were permitted across the industry. So certainly beef is both more concentrated but also all industries are tending towards concentration.

CHAKRABARTI: And just to be clear and correct me if I’m wrong but for example in poultry what you have is really vertical consolidation. Is that right?

KELLOWAY: Yes vertical consolidation. But also there are high degrees of horizontal consolidation at the regional level. So about half of all chicken farmers report having just one or two chicken processors to sell to.

CHAKRABARTI: Got it. OK. We’re running out of time here. So Bill let me just get down to essentials here. First of all we should acknowledge that Senator Chuck Grassley is trying to get legislation through Congress that would for example require that 50% of cattle go through open public auctions versus the smaller percentage now. Would that help?

CHAKRABARTI: Absolutely. That is how we could restore competition for domestic cattle in the U.S. marketplace. We must force the packers to again begin competing in the competitive marketplace. So the Senator Grassley’s bill is Senate Bill 949 is critically important. But the other measure is we have to empower consumers to begin sending those demand signals throughout the supply chain. And the only way they can do that is with a mandatory country of origin label. So they can choose to support the domestic supply chain the American cattle farmer or rancher or choose to buy beef produce under some other country’s food safety regime. Such as Namibia Africa or Uruguay or Costa Rica Nicaragua or any one of the 20 countries.

And so those are the two triage measures that are needed immediately in order to begin restoring competition to the marketplace. And one important factor here. The cattle industry is the single largest segment of American agriculture. Meaning it’s vitally important to rural communities all across America. But it’s also unique because it under-produces for the domestic market. And so our industry is shrinking in terms of number of producers number of cattle number of feedlots. And at the same time imports are increasing. And so they’re displacing and essentially preventing the U.S. cattle industry from even growing. And so that’s the fallacy behind the North American Meat Institute’s statement is that there is demand for beef. It’s simply being brought in offshore as opposed to being produced here in America.

CHAKRABARTI: Well Bill Bullard with the Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund. Joining us from Billings Montana. Bill thank you so much for being with us today.

BULLARD: My pleasure. Thank you.

CHAKRABARTI: Claire I’ve got one more question for you before we have to turn a corner here. You know our big picture analysis across this week is trying to explore the assertion that the current FTC chair Lina Khan has. That monopolies are not just bad for consumers but bad for democracy. That’s a very big statement. Do you think that rings true or not in the case of what we’re talking about with the beef industry?

KELLOWAY: I think it does. And I think it’s really connected to the antimonopoly tradition in the United States and the reasoning behind some of these laws being introduced way back when. But really corporate power in the terms of economic power and the size that some of these corporations have accommodated to also translates into political power. And we’re seeing right now just how challenging it is to regulate what is very clearly an issue with skyrocketing prices with all the disruption we’ve seen with farmers seeing such persistent low prices. The evidence is clear. And yet it is such a political struggle to enforce laws that are on the books and reform the system. So I think absolutely concentrated corporate power translates into political power. And that’s a threat to enacting democratic policies that people ranchers consumers are asking for.

CHAKRABARTI: Well Claire Kelloway with the Open Markets Institute. Thank you so much for joining us.

KELLOWAY: Yes thanks for having me.

CHAKRABARTI: Let me turn now to Jack Beatty On Point news analyst. He’s going to be with us throughout this week. Hello there Jack.

JACK BEATTY: Hello Meghna.

CHAKRABARTI: OK so you’ve been listening along Jack. I mean how do you see what’s happening with the beef industry in the broader picture of American corporate power in the past 20 25 years?

BEATTY: It’s really the story of what’s happened to American corporate power. According to one study 75% of industries saw more concentration just in the last 15 years. These include lighting and bulb manufacturers four companies controlled 90% of the market. Tires four companies 90%. Household appliances four companies 90%. Sanitary paper manufacturers four companies 92%. Beer one company has 70%. And of course there’s big tech we’re going to get into tomorrow. But wherever you look in the American economy this is an age of oligopoly and/or monopoly.

CHAKRABARTI: Well you heard Bill talk about the fact that there are laws already on the books right now that could be enforced that might have headed off this consolidation in the beef industry. So again it just always requires regulatory and political will. Do you see that potentially emerging in the face of this tsunami?

BEATTY: One would like it to be but it’s far too seek. You know polls of what people think of big business shows basically half and half. Half like it half don’t. But you know there was a kind of road test in the last campaign of Do you want to break monopolies? That was the foundation of Elizabeth Warren’s campaign. She came fourth in New Hampshire. She came third in her own state. People weren’t listening. It wasn’t what they thought of as the major problem.

Maybe one problem with her position and with you know ripping up public support for this is the connection with inequality. Are the two things related? You know the concentration of industry and the share of national income going to the top 1%. In 1969 that was 8% of national income went to the top 1%. Today it’s a quarter 25%. Are the two things related? Are all of us somehow being impoverished by this great concentration at the top? We’ll have to see how that debate goes.

CHAKRABARTI: Jack give us like a like a one minute preview of what’s coming down the pike next week specifically on this point. Because you have written entire books about the political culture at the heart of the previous great wave of antitrust action in this country a century ago. How different is the culture that you just talked about now the political culture versus then?

BEATTY: The big difference is ideas have changed. And we’re going to get into this. The role particularly of the Chicago School of Economics on jurisprudence and understanding what antitrust is. Everything now in the legal profession comes down to Is it a monopoly if the price is remains low? If the consumer gets a bargain there’s no harm done. And the leader of this of course was Robert Bork whose book was massively influential. And it is still the case that the courts are the gatekeepers here. And the courts are permeated pervaded by people by judges lawyers the establishment bar that believe that idea. That antitrust is a faded passion as Richard Hofstadter called it a fading passion of American reform. We don’t need it. We’re getting cheap goods. That’s enough. No other harm arises from monopoly huh?

CHAKRABARTI: Well as Jack said tomorrow we’re going to be looking at the tech sector specifically. Because FTC Chair Lina Khan has actually made her career focusing on monopolistic practices in the tech sector. So we’ll be talking about what the proposed merger between Microsoft and Activision Blizzard might tell us. Jack is joining us for the full hour on Wednesday where we’re going to go back in time a century or more. And talk about the previous big waves of antitrust fervor in this country. And then as Jack mentioned on Thursday we’re doing a show that’ll take a look at Robert Bork’s influence on how antitrust is defined in the United States. And then on Friday we’re going to ask this question about whether Lina Khan and Elizabeth Warren are asking the right question about problems with democracy problems with inequality. But is focusing on monopolies the wrong solution to the right question? So Jack are you looking forward to it?

BEATTY: I am. I’m keen.

CHAKRABARTI: OK well we’ll be hearing from Jack every single day this week during our special series More than money: The cost of monopolies in America. I’m Meghna Chakrabarti. This is On Point.

BIG by Matt Stoller: “Beef Is Expensive. So Why Are Cattle Ranchers Going Bankrupt?” — “During the Covid pandemic Americans went to the supermarket and found something that hadn’t happened for decades – a meat shortage. There was plenty of cattle but the beef wasn’t getting to the supermarket shelves.”

TIME: “U.S. Food Prices Are Up. Are the Food Corporations to Blame for Taking Advantage?” — “2021 was a bad year for grocery bills. Shoppers paid 6.4% more for groceries in November 2021 compared to November 2020 according to the consumer price index.”

The 22-year-old Asamoah a rookie linebacker who was a third-round pick forced and recovered a fumble with a punch worthy of Charles Tillman in Saturday's victory over the Giants. Asamoah is raising the bar after getting more playing time.

Asamoah requested edge rusher Danielle Hunter's jersey after the game. Hunter penned his signature handed it over and then told reporters how Asamoah fell short of his expectations on the 12-yard fumble return.

""I was expecting him to go all the way but he didn't"" Hunter said. ""I expect a lot of good things — a lot of great things from him in the future.""

Asamoah is among a handful of young defenders seeing increased action in the home stretch for the NFC North champion Vikings. With a playoff berth cemented coach Kevin O'Connell is balancing youth development and health on a veteran-laden roster while also chasing victories for the best possible seed this postseason.

Against the Giants Asamoah rotated series with starting inside linebackers Eric Kendricks and Jordan Hicks. He finished with a season-high 39% playing time. Rookie defensive lineman Esezi Otomewo played a season-high 18%. Third-year safety Josh Metellus also replaced starter Harrison Smith for one series.

""All they did was go out and be incredibly productive"" O'Connell said Monday. ""Those three guys took advantage of their opportunities and provided some great snaps for us in our attempt to help keep some of our other guys fresh.""

Need for depth

A dash of youth also helps O'Connell manage health. Hicks (ankle) Kendricks (hip) and Smith (neck) have all been on December injury reports. All three watched parts of Saturday's victory from the sideline: Hicks got 23 snaps off; Kendricks stepped out for 13 snaps; Smith watched 10 snaps.

While preparing to face an in-the-hunt Packers team on Sunday O'Connell said he will continue to toe the line between talent development and trying to win.

""There's a lot out in front of us as a team"" O'Connell said. ""We've been able to clinch the division and we know that we'll be a part of the playoffs but there's a lot to be said for trying to give ourselves an opportunity for the most amount of home games we possibly can while also making sure we're taking care of our roster.""

Rookie growth has been limited by injuries. First-round safety Lewis Cine (leg fractures) second-round cornerback Andrew Booth Jr. (knee) fourth-round cornerback Akayleb Evans (concussions) and sixth-round running back Ty Chandler (thumb) remain on injured reserve. Chandler returned to practice earlier this month. The Vikings have until Wednesday to activate him before his three-week practice window ends.

Learning curve

Guard Ed Ingram a second-rounder and Asamoah the third-round pick have given coaches more to evaluate. Asamoah credited his growth to learning behind Kendricks and Hicks who each had a team-leading 10 tackles (solo and assisted) against the Giants.

""We're the best unit when we're out there"" Asamoah said. ""So we have to go out there and play like it. We did that [Saturday]. I think them boys pulled down 10. That linebacker group is a scary group.""

Kendricks said Asamoah has grown past a rookie-like tunnel vision on his assignments.

""As the season has progressed"" Kendricks said ""he's kind of thinking bigger picture now and starting to understand what's going on — seeing things besides what's going on at his position. It's refreshing to see because obviously we know he has great energy running to the ball and causing plays splash plays. I'm excited to see how good he gets.""

Metellus the 2020 sixth-round pick out of Michigan has made game-changing plays in two Vikings wins. His game-sealing interception against the Lions on Sept. 25 — his first of two starts this season for Smith — preceded Saturday's blocked Giants punt that led to a fourth-quarter touchdown.

Depth to defensive line

Otomewo the former Gophers defender drafted in the fifth round has impressed coaches with effort. During his NFL debut in the Dec. 11 loss in Detroit Otomewo chased and thwarted a screen. The following week O'Connell said he showed the play in a team meeting as an example of relentlessness.

More is likely on the horizon for Otomewo. Rotational defensive tackle James Lynch is expected to miss at least Sunday's game in Green Bay. Lynch reaggravated his shoulder injury against the Giants per O'Connell two weeks after suffering the injury in Detroit.

""We've felt the last quarter of the season we need to get [Otomewo] going"" defensive coordinator Ed Donatell said last week. ""He brings fresh legs. He brings explosion. He's a good listener.

""We want to have everybody playing well. That's part of coaching rookies. They usually don't do a lot for you in September unless they're rare."""

The cities with the highest number of Uber trips in 2022 are Delhi-NCR Bengaluru Hyderabad Mumbai and Kolkata with Delhi-NCR clocking the highest number of office-hour trips showed data from Uber's annual analysis report titled ‘How India Ubered in 2022’.

“The year 2022 saw Indians start traveling big again and cities swinging back open for business after the pandemic. Uber trips during the year covered as many as 4.5 billion kilometers” the report said.

Uber launched operations in new cities during the year including being the first ridesharing company to have a presence in all seven Northeast sister states.

“Uber is now present in 123 cities in India spread across all corners of the country. In terms of the debutant cities Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh emerged as the newcomer city with the highest number of trips showing proof of the love received by Uber there” the report added.

In FY22 Uber India reported a 7 percent increase in revenue from operations at Rs 397 crore for the year ended March 2022. The mobility firm’s total loss fell to Rs 216 crore from Rs 339 crore last year.

“The most popular product in terms of the number of trips was Uber Go with Uber Auto coming in a very close second - showing the growing preference for App commute for vehicles typically hailed off the roads earlier” the report said.

This comes at a time when Bengaluru residents who use app-based autos like Ola Uber and Rapido on a regular basis highlighted issues such as increased waiting time non-acceptance of online payments cancellation requests and extra cash above the estimated ride charge.

At the heart of all this is the ongoing wrangling over commission charges and licenses of app-based auto aggregators Ola Uber and Rapido with Karnataka’s transport department.

In the recent report Uber also said that during October 2022 the highest number of package deliveries happened through Uber Connect and as many as 53 percent of the Uber trips in 2022 had riders shower drivers with their appreciation in the form of a 5-star rating.

“In terms of preferences for Uber Rentals rides with multiple stops most riders opted for the 2-hour 20-kilometer package helping them get done with business meetings doctor visits and other chores” the report said."

When asked if Wyoming stores would ever receive the service the nation’s largest retailer didn’t respond.

According to a statement the company planned to offer the service at 34 sites in six states by the end of the year which would have included Utah and Virginia as well as Arkansas where the service was first offered.

The company hasn’t yet announced drone delivery for Utah or Virginia but it’s continuing to rapidly expand the program.

Announcements about the service say Walmart wants to expand its drone infrastructure to deliver 1 million packages per year.

So there may be hope for Wyoming drone deliveries in the future.

Hamburger Helper

In 2020 Walmart partnered with commercial drone company DroneUp for trial deliveries of at-home COVID-19 test kits. After the trials delivered hundreds of kits from Walmart stores in Las Vegas Nevada and Cheektowaga New York the company branched into general deliveries in May at Arkansas locations including Walmart’s Supercenter in Bentonville.

“While Walmart initially thought customers would use the service for emergency items we’re finding they use it for its sheer convenience like a quick fix for a weeknight meal” DroneUp says in a press release on its delivery partnership. “The top-selling item at one of our current hubs is Hamburger Helper.”

The way the service works is customers within a mile of a participating store select their items from the DroneUp Delivery website between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. local time. For a fee of $3.99 the drones can deliver more than 10000 eligible items weighing up to 10 pounds. This includes fragile items like eggs. It takes about 30 minutes to arrive at the customer’s home.

FAA Regulations

To use drones in any commercial activity the pilot is required to have an FAA license.

Pilots have to follow certain guidelines which includes operating the drone within line of sight of the pilot. Pilots can receive waivers to deviate from FAA regulations for operating drones but these are not always easy to obtain.

According to ReedSmith a global law firm DroneUp got around the waiver requirements by constructing towers in participating store parking lots that allow pilots to see for up to 1.5 miles.

DroneUp founder Tom Walker told ReedSmith the company hopes to obtain a line-of-sight waiver which will allow deliveries up to 3 miles from the store.

Patrick Santucci director of marketing and communications for DroneUp told Cowboy State Daily the company’s pilots are still using line-of-sight operations.

Other Drone Services

Walmart and DroneUp appear to be succeeding where Amazon stumbled.

In 2013 Amazon founder Jeff Bezos announced the company would launch a drone delivery service within the next five years. It received widespread media buzz.

A Bloomberg investigation earlier this year revealed the Prime Air program faced technical challenges high turnover and safety issues. In one incident a drone crashed when multiple safety features failed and the pilot lost control of the aircraft.

The crash also started a brush fire.

In June Amazon announced it would begin Prime Air deliveries in Lockeford California.

Wing is another drone delivery service but rather than rotary drones the company makes deliveries with unmanned fixed-wing aircraft that launch vertically like the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey aircraft.

Unlike the Osprey the wings don’t tilt to bring the propellers forward. Wing’s drones have propellers on its top and wings.

The company partnered with DoorDash and KFC in Australia. It’s working with Walgreens to begin a U.S. delivery service.

UPS Flight Forward Inc. a subsidiary of United Parcel Service is another drone delivery service in development.

Like Wing it uses fixed-wing aircraft. The company is focusing on transporting medical samples.

In 2019 it became the first company to receive an FAA certification that permits operations of a remote-controlled unmanned airline.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vc21hbGwtYml6L3RyYWRlL2V4cG9ydHMvaW5zaWdodHMvYW1hem9uLWxvb2tzLXRvLXNlbGwtZXhjZXNzLWFpci1jYXJnby1zcGFjZS1hcy1kZW1hbmQtY29vbHMvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTY1MDczOTguY21z0gGVAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9zbWFsbC1iaXovdHJhZGUvZXhwb3J0cy9pbnNpZ2h0cy9hbWF6b24tbG9va3MtdG8tc2VsbC1leGNlc3MtYWlyLWNhcmdvLXNwYWNlLWFzLWRlbWFuZC1jb29scy9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTY1MDczOTguY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon looks to sell excess air cargo space as demand cools,"It seems like you're already an ETPrime member with

This year has been shaped by uncomfortable macroeconomic headwinds.

Trillions of dollars were erased in public company market capitalizations investor confidence waned and cost pressures squeezed consumer pocketbooks.

Taken together many of the world’s largest companies experienced sharp declines in market share. Still a few companies in key sectors had positive growth over the year.

As 2022 comes to a close the above infographic shows the biggest companies in the world using data from Companiesmarketcap.com.

The World’s Largest Public Companies in 2022

Today Apple stands as the world’s most valuable company towering at a $2.3 trillion valuation.

Despite the tech downturn of 2022—driven by rising interest rates and slower sales—Apple maintained its top spot. This was largely thanks to record revenues and healthy consumer demand for iPhones which drive about half of its total revenue.

Following Apple is Microsoft. Unlike Apple Microsoft has faced slower earnings over the year due to lower demand for personal computers and the weighing impact of a strong U.S. dollar. Overall about 50% of the company’s sales take place overseas.

As we show below there are now only four companies left in the trillion dollar market cap club.

*As of Dec 12 2022.

Oil giant Saudi Aramco is the third largest publicly-traded company globally at $1.8 trillion. It’s also the only non-U.S. company in the top 10.

In May the state-run company briefly became the most valuable company on the planet as soaring energy prices boosted earnings. Saudia Arabia is the largest exporter of oil in the world and the country’s economy is forecast to grow 7.6% in 2022—one of the fastest globally.

Overall 62 companies of the 100 largest are headquartered in the U.S. 11 are based in China and five are located in France.

Top 10 Performance in 2022

For many of the world’s largest companies 2022 was a brutal year for performance.

As the above graphic shows the vast majority of the world’s titans saw their market values decline. Half of these companies saw double-digit drops.

Tesla has witnessed nearly 70% of its market cap being erased this year. Two main factors are behind this drop: falling demand especially in China and CEO Elon Musk’s volatile and risky acquisition of Twitter.

On the other hand UnitedHealth Group has seen the strongest performance among the top 10.

The company which rakes in a large share of its earnings from employer-backed insurance plans said that recessionary impacts had not yet begun materializing in 2022.

Biggest Companies in the World by Sector

Even with sinking market values across the sector in 2022 tech remains dominant.

Among the world’s biggest companies 20 are in tech spanning a combined market value of $9.2 trillion. For perspective that’s about 31% of the market value of the 100 largest companies.

Rank Sector Combined Market Value Number of Companies Biggest Company in Sector 1 👩‍💻 Technology $9.2T 20 Apple 2 🚗 Consumer Discretionary $4.7T 17 Amazon 3 🩺 Health Care $4.3T 17 UnitedHealth Group 4 🛢️ Energy $3.4T 8 Saudi Aramco 5 💵 Financials $3.0T 14 Berkshire Hathaway 6 🏭 Industrials $1.8T 9 Visa 7 🥫 Consumer Staples $1.8T 7 Procter & Gamble 8 📞 Telecommunications $841B 5 Cisco 9 ⛏️ Basic Materials $326B 2 Linde 10 🔌 Utilities $127B 1 Nextera Energy

Companies are classified according to the FTSE Russell Industry Classification Benchmark. *As of Dec 12 2022.

Consumer discretionary and health care sectors fall next in line with big players such as Amazon and Johnson & Johnson among their ranks.

At the other end of the spectrum is utilities the smallest sector overall at least pertaining to the largest companies list. NextEra Energy the sole utilities company among the rankings is one of the world’s largest developers of wind and solar energy. Over the next three years it plans to invest up to $95 billion in greening its power operations.

Change of Fortune

It comes as no surprise that many of the biggest companies in the world are long-established players in global markets.

Yet within the rankings some of the notable risers compared to 2021 are UnitedHealth Group which launched from #19 in 2021 to #8 this year and NVIDIA which has climbed to become the 11th largest company globally up from #24 last year.

By contrast some of the biggest losers are Meta (Facebook’s parent company) and Alibaba. Meta has fallen across the rankings to #26 in 2022 from #6 in 2021. Meanwhile Alibaba was once the ninth largest globally but has tumbled to #36. Both companies have seen considerable value wiped from their market caps—roughly 66% and 28% respectively​​—amid lagging earnings.

With the year coming to a close it remains to be seen whether the world’s biggest companies stage a comeback in 2023 or face more challenging conditions ahead.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9nb2xmL2hvdy1tdWNoLXJvcnktbWNpbHJveS1tYWtlLWJyYW5kLWVuZG9yc2VtZW50c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How much does Rory McIlroy make from brand endorsements?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9nb2xmL2hvdy1tdWNoLXJvcnktbWNpbHJveS1tYWtlLWJyYW5kLWVuZG9yc2VtZW50c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021225E811B0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

America is one of the world's most industrialized regions with the largest economy in nominal terms. This also makes it one of the world's largest consumers of electricity ranking second only to China through 3.9 trillion kilowatt hours (kWh) in 2021. In terms of sources of energy consumption petroleum and natural gas account for the largest sources and renewable energy ranks in third place. Sector wise industrial transportation and electrical power use are the largest electricity consumers in the U.S. and natural gas is the most widely used production source according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Courtesy of some of the best educational institutions in the world the U.S. is also leading the charge in researching innovative mediums for generating renewable energy. Not only is Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) an American firm the world's first car maker to successfully mass produce an electric vehicle but researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are investigating methods to improve electricity generation through waves and the Sun as well as new mediums to store electricity. While solar cells are common these days these materials are unable to tap the vast amounts of energy that the Sun beams down to the Earth. On this front MIT is searching for materials that are cost effective scalable reliable and efficient at the same time. To do this they are utilizing machine learning and rapid experimentation to quickly sift through materials in hopes that a new one will provide a breakthrough.

When talking about energy any discussion would be incomplete without nuclear power plants. There are two kinds of nuclear reactions fission and fusion. With the former atoms are split up to squeeze out energy from them. However the latter is vastly more powerful (and complex) since it requires squeezing the atoms together and the resulting energy is harnessed as power. Fusion is the Sun's primary energy source and all nuclear plants in the world use fission instead. In the area of fusion the U.S. federal Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California was able to generate more energy from a Hydrogen plasma bombarded with lasers than the electricity used in operating the lasers instead. This was a crucial breakthrough since fusion is the most efficient and cleanest source of power - even on the nuclear front as it does not generate any radioactive waste.

Story continues

Additionally America also passed one of the most important pieces of legislation for renewable energy this year in form of the Inflation Reduction Act. This bill provides roughly $370 billion in government subsidies for clean power generation. This provides the incentive for even some of the biggest American energy companies to invest in the field. Finally global crude oil prices have injected fresh rigor into renewable energy production after they jumped to a whopping $139 per barrel earlier this year in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Today we'll take a look at the largest American energy firms with the top picks being Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE).

It is offering a 16 percent discount on its Welcome Unlimited plan and promising a “price guarantee” for three years. The carrier‘s cheapest unlimited plan now starts at just $25 per line per month for four lines down $5 from the previous monthly rate of $30 per line. Verizon says this is its “best” unlimited price ever.

Customers who sign up during this campaign will continue to pay the same price for at least three more years. Verizon will not increase the plan rates though taxes and fees may change. However if any of the four lines that you added upgrade cancel or move to an eligible plan the price guarantee will no longer be valid. This limited-time discount also requires you to bring your own phone and sign up for paper-free billing with Auto Pay. If you’re not okay with that the plan will cost $10 more — $35 per line per month. It’s still a $5 discount though.

This $5 discount is also available if you buy less than four lines or add as many as five lines. Verizon’s Welcome Unlimited currently costs $60 per month for a single line ($70 without paper-free billing with Auto Pay). Likewise the rate for two lines is $50/$60 per month per line while that for three lines is $35/$45 per month per line. If you get five lines you will pay $50/$30 per month for each line. However the price guarantee is seemingly only available if you add four lines with your own 4G/5G smartphone. Over three years this totals $720 in savings. Verizon will apply a $180 promo credit per phone over this period.

Verizon matches T-Mobile with its latest Welcome Unlimited discount

This discount for Verizon’s Welcome Unlimited plan makes it comparable to T-Mobile’s Essentials plan. The latter also cost $100 per month for four lines ($25 per line) and gives you unlimited talk text and 5G data. Moreover the price guarantee promise is something T-Mobile has been promoting heavily. Verizon has matched that as well though only for three years and with a limited-time discount.

Verizon also recently run a similar campaign promising a ten-year price lock on its Home Internet products. Maybe the campaign was successful and the company is now aiming to repeat it with phone plans. The latest campaign is already live and will only run for a limited time.

Investors saw a lot of red in 2022. But a company known for its magenta logo was a stock market darling this year.

Shares of T-Mobile (TMUS) rose about 20% in 2022 even as rivals AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) tumbled. Ma Bell was down about 2% while Verizon (VZ) plunged more than 25%.

T-Mobile is now worth about $175 billion as well more than Verizon and AT&T both of which are Dow components. T-Mobile’s solid performance on Wall Street was one big reason why CEO Mike Sievert is the CNN Business pick for CEO of the Year.

Sievert beat out several other contenders including Michele Buck at Hershey (HSY) Occidental Petroleum’s (OXY) Vicki Hollub and Arvind Krishna of IBM (IBM). He joins 2021 CEO of the Year choice Albert Bourla of Pfizer (PFE) and previous winners Marc Benioff of Salesforce (CRM) Target (TGT) CEO Brian Cornell and Chipotle’s (CMG) Brian Niccol.

T-Mobile had an impressive year despite many economic challenges including inflation. The company continued to gain market share at the expense of its rivals.

It also spent more money to blanket the country with increased 5G coverage and it has done some noteworthy partnerships including one with Elon Musk’s SpaceX to try and gain more customers.

CNN Business spoke to Sievert about how T-Mobile has continued to perform well in a super competitive business.

Sievert said the company is aware that “consumers are fearing inflation.” That’s why T-Mobile is trying to keep prices down even as competitors have raised the cost of many of their plans because inflation hurt their profitability.

T-Mobile is even continuing to cover the cost of Netflix (NFLX) subscriptions for its subscribers following price hikes by the streaming media giant.

“It’s just another example of us making a big investment in customers changing the industry in their favor putting them first and making an investment in them” Sievert said.

The strategy is working. T-Mobile thanks to its merger with Sprint in 2020 is now the second-largest wireless carrier in the US ahead of AT&T and trailing only Verizon.

The company has about 112 million customers and has been adding subscribers at a faster clip than both of its main rivals. A 2021 data breach which T-Mobile paid $350 million for this year to settle class-action suits hasn’t dented growth either.

Is wireless recession-proof?

But there are some concerns. Sievert said inflation is among them mainly for its employees. He explained that the company has boosted worker pay to account for rising prices. That has led to higher expenses but Sievert said T-Mobile is less worried about inflation than other consumer firms.

“We’re somewhat insulated from inflation” he said adding that T-Mobile’s average revenue per customer has increased this year not because of price increases but due to the fact that one of the company’s more popular plans is a higher-priced service that offers more features.

Growing recession worries are an issue too even though Sievert said “we don’t see it as a foregone conclusion that a recession is coming. But we are prepared if it is.”

Sievert noted that wireless customers are probably going to be very reluctant to cut back on using their phones though even if the economy heads south. That could make any downturn next year less of a problem than the 2008-2009 Great Recession was for cell phone companies.

“We are in a category that people will retain. This is very different than 2008 before the smartphone revolution. People will hold on to wireless” he said.

Cell phone service from the stars

It helps that wireless technology is also a lot more advanced now than 14 years ago. Sievert said T-Mobile has also been able to capitalize on the fact that it has spent a lot on wireless spectrum auctions to fill out its 5G coverage map across the country.

“It’s about more devices being able to connect customers with devices that serve all purposes in their life including rapid growth of 5G home broadband” Sievert said.

“We feel so fortunate to have this massive multi-year lead on the 5G race in this category” he noted adding that T-Mobile was “dead last” in the 4G market not that long ago.

But AT&T and Verizon are both ramping up their 5G coverage plans too. And let’s be honest. There’s not that much anymore to differentiate one wireless carrier from another. They all pretty much offer the same new and popular phones from Samsung (SSNLF) and the latest iPhone 14 from Apple (AAPL).

Enter SpaceX. T-Mobile announced a joint venture with Musk’s rocket launching company this year to use SpaceX’s Starlink satellites to offer wireless services in areas with little to no coverage.

“The idea of being able to get you connected wherever you can see the sky that’s potentially groundbreaking” Sievert said. “We’re now heads down attempting to create together a service that will connect your mobile phone directly to a satellite” he said.

Sievert said he and Musk worked together “on several occasions” to get the deal right adding that he was impressed by “how mission driven” Musk and the entire SpaceX leadership team are.

“You can just feel the passion when you’re talking to Elon or any senior person at SpaceX that they deeply believe in the importance of what they’re doing for humanity” he said.

Prepared for more competition

Sievert who has been with T-Mobile since 2012 took over as CEO in 2020 from long-time CEO John Legere. Sievert may be a little less bombastic and flamboyant than Legere who was known for taunting the competition not to mention his rockstar-length hair and penchant for leather jackets.

Still Sievert remains confident that the company will continue to keep growing. To that end he’s not worried about the fact that cable companies are trying to cash in on the wireless boom too. Both Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter (CHTR) have deals with Verizon to offer cell phone service over Verizon’s network.

Sievert said he respects the competition from cable.

“These are very successful companies who seem very serious about the space” he said. “But I’d much rather be a mobile company using advanced 5G technology to challenge the cable space than the other way around.”

But Sievert is not too concerned about them denting T-Mobile’s growth.

“Cable’s been at it in wireless now for years and they’re realizing a certain amount of success” he said. But he added that it’s been more at the lower end of the market.

T-Mobile instead wants to keep trying to attract more subscribers willing to pay up for premium packages. And Sievert said that T-Mobile can do that by continuing to market itself as the so-called “un-carrier” that is different from all its rivals. That includes the heavy use of its prominent magenta logo.

Sievert even joked about the fact that Pantone just named Viva Magenta as its color of the year.

“We’re on trend for 2022 and 2023” he said. “But this has been a part of our imagery for a long time. And what we want people at one glance is to see that our company is a little different than everybody else. This isn’t a tired and staid old telco. This is a technology company that’s deeply passionate about what we do.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYXVyYWxjcmF2ZS5jb20vZW4vMjAyMi8xMi8yNi9wYXVsLWdpYW1hdHRpLWlzLWVpbnN0ZWluLWluLXRoZS12ZXJpem9uLWNvbW1lcmNpYWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paul Giamatti is Einstein in the Verizon commercial,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='auralcrave.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /en/2022/12/26/paul-giamatti-is-einstein-in-the-verizon-commercial/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000212261D06D0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYXVyYWxjcmF2ZS5jb20vZW4vMjAyMi8xMi8yNi9wYXVsLWdpYW1hdHRpLWlzLWVpbnN0ZWluLWluLXRoZS12ZXJpem9uLWNvbW1lcmNpYWwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vYXVyYWxjcmF2ZS5jb20vZW4vMjAyMi8xMi8yNS90aGUtd2VkbmVzZGF5LXNvbmctYmxvb2R5LW1hcnktdGhlLWx5cmljcy1tZWFuaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"""The Wednesday song"" Bloody Mary: the lyrics & meaning","Most of the world already knows it: Bloody Mary the track released by Lady Gaga in 2011 as part of her album Born This Way is not really the song in the famous dance scene of the Netflix TV series Wednesday. That was Goo Goo Muck and we explained its whole story in this article. Nevertheless if you happened to scroll TikTok at the end of 2022 you surely noticed how that dance became viral under the notes of Lady Gaga’s song especially the part where the singer sings “I’ll dance dance dance / with my hands hands hands / above my head head head.” It’s one of those cases where social networks ruled on top of the rest and now it’s time to understand better the hidden meaning behind the lyrics of Gaga’s Bloody Mary. You’ll also find the complete lyrics at the end of this article. Let’s go.

You can find the official streaming of Bloody Mary below.

Bloody Mary the “wrong” Wednesday song: the lyrics & meaning

Many of those who discovered it after Wednesday will be surprised to find out that Bloody Mary has nothing to do with dancing: the song is actually about Mary Magdalene’s love for Jesus. In the lyrics Lady Gaga sings the imagined words of Mary Magdalene after Jesus’s death facing the world’s judgment and the bad faith of those who will write history according to their point of view.

Mary Magdalene defines herself as “Bloody Mary”: she has Jesus’ blood on her she was under the cross when He died and she’s ready to accept her destiny now that her love is gone.

Love is just a history that they may prove

And when you’re gone

I’ll tell them my religion’s you

When Punktious comes to kill the king upon his throne

I’m ready for their stones

Mary Magdalene is driven only by love: she is Jesus’ most passionate follower because she truly loved Him. And she’s ready to face her destiny when the Roman Empire comes to punish her stoning her to death for adultery. From this point of view Mary sacrifices her life for Jesus in a form of love that mixes passion and worship.

The famous lines in the chorus are actually Mary Magdalene’s bold attitude in front of the punishment she will receive: she’ll not react she won’t show anger or hate; she’ll follow Jesus’ words and forgive her enemies expressing His supreme love:

I’ll dance dance dance

With my hands hands hands

Above my head head head

Like Jesus said

Dedicating her whole life to loving and worshipping Jesus Mary Magdalene is ready to become “Bloody Mary” and pass into history. She won’t cry she says as a martyr who already accepted her destiny glad to die for what she believes most.

I won’t cry for you

I won’t crucify the things you do

I won’t cry for you

See (See) when you’re gone I’ll still be Bloody Mary

That’s the real hidden meaning behind the lyrics of Bloody Mary: I’m Jesus’ true love and I won’t hate you for killing Him and me; I’ll forgive you and love you as He taught all of us. And I’ll dance dance dance with my hands above my head while you’ll throw stones at me.

Obtaining a construction loan:

A new union formed in 2021 between Fontainbleau Resorts LLC a leading Florida-based owner builder and operator in the hospitality commercial and retail industry and Koch Real Estate Investments (KREI) the real estate subsidiary of Koch Industries based in Dallas Texas is responsible for continuation of the project.

The companies together with J.P. Morgan as its administrative agent obtained a $2.2 billion construction loan to finish the construction of the Fontainbleau Las Vegas resort & casino.

Jacob Fransis President of Koch Real Estate Investments said in an official statement: “We secured the construction loan through J.P. Morgan SMBC Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies Goldman Sachs Guggenheim and real estate investment trust VICI Properties. J.P. Morgan acted as administrative agent. We thank them for recognizing both the potential of this property and the expertise of those involved in its capitalization design and construction.

“Securing $2.2 billion in financing in today’s market speaks to the widespread confidence in this project and the team that’s come together to bring it to Las Vegas.”

Restarting the Fontainebleau project:

During November 2021 the long-delayed Fontainebleau project was relaunched after the Florida-based founder reacquired the 25-acre site nine months later.

However the $2 billion project was originally started in 2009. But after the founders didn’t have enough money to continue i.e. lack of investors the project was put on hold when it was 75% complete.

During that time the project experienced a bankruptcy foreclosure sale and passed through the hands of two owners before finally ending up in the hands of Fontainebleau Development Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Soffer after he regained the 67-story blue-tinted-glass-hotel-casino.

Since then the project has been continuously developed over the past year.

Layout of the proposed hotel & casino.

The highly anticipated 67-story resort & casino will offer 3700 premier hotel rooms a casino 550 000 square feet of convention and meeting space and a collection of restaurants retail and lifestyle attractions. It will be located at the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip which is directly connected to the Las Vegas Convention Center.

This time it’s his husband who has a lot of questions.

DAYS Spoilers Highlights

Sonny (Zach Tinker) stood his ground with his grandfather but Will Horton (Chandler Massey) isn’t willing to hear it. This man has ruined their lives more than once and he doesn’t want Leo (Greg Rikaart) around any of them at all…ever. Why would Sonny think any of this is a good idea especially after the last year or so?

Can Sonny find a way to convince Will his friend is a changed man? Sonny may be able to convince himself but he’s certainly not convincing anyone else especially Will. Let’s just hope this little spat doesn’t put a damper on their romance. Their marriage is fragile enough right now.

DOOL Spoilers: Surprise Visitors

Alex Kiriakis (Robert Scott Wilson) and Stephanie Johnson’s (Abigail Klein) romantic time alone comes to a screeching halt once again when Chad DiMera (Billy Flynn) comes knocking. The pair take the interruption in stride and of course invite Chad in. He’s always welcome after all. Stephanie may regret it though when the boys find out they have something in common. Will it leave her left out and serving snacks?

Also getting a surprise visit is Paulina Price Carver (Jackée Harry). She turns into a pile of mush and love when Eli Grant (Lamon Archey) shows up with her grandbabies. Seeing the twins is wonderful and look for Paulina to soak in every second.

Days of our Lives Spoilers: Schemes Unravel

Meanwhile Sarah Horton Cook (Linsey Godfrey) stumbles across her husband having a shady meeting at the park with Gwen Rizczech (Emily O’Brien). While this looks bad what she hears them saying is way worse. Is this the moment things fall apart on the scheming exes?

Sarah has suspected Xander Cook (Paul Telfer) was up to no good for a while now. She tried her hardest to believe in him but deep down she knew it was all too good to be true. Now she has to face facts — the man she loves doesn’t know how to stay out of trouble.

Up today stories Nos. 10 and 9.

The railroad industry’s search for alternatives to diesel-electric power continued to move forward in 2022 with manufacturers and railroads making inroads on developing battery-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell alternatives.

Union Pacific set the tone in January when it announced it would buy 10 FLXdrive battery-electric units from Wabtec and 10 EMD Joule locomotives from Progress Rail for trial use as switch engines at yards in North Platte Neb. and Southern California. UP later announced it would partner with technology firm ZTR to build six diesel-battery hybrids at its North Little Rock Ark. shops.

Australian mining firm BHP also split a locomotive order between Wabtec and Progress buying two units from each while another Australian firm Rio Tinto ordered four of the Wabtec units.

Wabtec’s biggest FLXdrive order to date however came from Kazakstan’s national railway which signed up for 150 battery-electric switchers as well as conversion of its mainline locomotive fleet from diesel to liquefied natural gas.

Progress meanwhile will also provide up to four EMD Joule SD70J locomotives to BNSF Railway for testing in Southern California. Those locomotives will have 8 megawatt-hours of capacity the largest storage capacity for a battery-electric in North America. Progress also added diesel-battery hybrids to its product line; Brazilian railway and logistics company Rumo is to receive the first two units. No North American buyers have yet been announced.

Canadian Pacific hydrogen unit debuts

Leading the development of hydrogen locomotives to date is Canadian Pacific which in October saw the revenue debut of the first of three planned home-built units. CEO Keith Creel told the RailTrends conference that “the potential … is real” for the technology. The railroad has developed the locomotives in hopes of finding a manufacturer to take the project forward and build enough units to prove the technology in mainline service in the Canadian Rockies.

“If you can operate there — heavy haul cold temperatures the most challenging operational conditions I’ve ever experienced in my career … it will work anywhere” Creel said.

A hydrogen switcher is also being developed by California’s Sierra Northern Railway under a $4 million grant awarded by the state in 2021. The railroad has not indicated when that unit might debut.

California will also be the home of the first hydrogen-powered passenger equipment in the U.S. a Stadler FLIRT trainset to operate on the San Bernardino-Redlands Arrow commuter line. That equipment which was unveiled at the InnoTrans trade fair in Germany is currently testing in Europe and is expected to arrive in the U.S. in 2024. Stadler also announced a memorandum of understanding with two California agencies for up to 29 hydrogen trainsets for use in Amtrak California service.

The current round of tests and prototypes may not lead to a single dominant technology to replace the diesel-electric. So suggested Venu Madala Wabtec group vice president product management at an industry conference this fall.

“Everybody is going to have a very unique fleet and they’re going to have very unique requirements from their fleet strategy perspective” Madala said. “And our goal is that we’re going to be able to help each customer uniquely by having solutions available in different areas.”

Buffalo residents are facing driving bans widespread power outages and a rising death toll as a result of what is being called its deadliest storm in four decades. Social media users are sharing a video they claim shows a Walmart that was looted during the winter storm's upheaval.

The video which was shared on Facebook shows the inside of a ransacked and destroyed Walmart. The floor is flooded and the shelves are empty while an alarm rings in the background.

""NEW: #Walmart store devastated by ongoing looting in #Buffalo #NewYork"" reads the Dec. 26 post's caption.

The video garnered more than 20000 views in four days. Similar versions of the claim have been shared on Facebook and Twitter.

But the video was not filmed recently in a Buffalo Walmart. It dates back to 2020 when protestors looted a Walmart in Philadelphia in response to the police killing a Black man. There has not been any looting at any Walmarts in Buffalo according to a Walmart spokesperson.

USA TODAY reached out to the user who shared the post for comment.

Video was captured in Philadelphia in 2020

Charles Crowson a Walmart spokesperson told USA TODAY that the Facebook video doesn't show a looted Walmart in Buffalo. He added that there have not been any recent accounts of looting in any of the chain's Buffalo locations.

The scenery shown in the Facebook video matches that of a YouTube video published in 2020. The same ransacked shelves and flooded floors can be seen in the video.

""Walmart Looted in Philadelphia"" reads the YouTube video's title.

The video's description says the Walmart was located in Port Richmond a neighborhood in Philadelphia.

USA TODAY reported at the time that widespread looting and protests in Philadelphia were the results of local police killing a Black man named Walter Wallace. He was shot multiple times after advancing toward officers holding a knife police said at the time. Police said more than 1000 people were looting businesses in Port Richmond on the night of Oct. 27.

NBC10 in Philadelphia broadcast aerial footage of the Port Richmond Walmart being looted while footage of the inside of the flooded store was later aired by Fox29 in Philadelphia.

This claim has been debunked by Reuters as well.

Photo by Kimberly White/Getty Images for Vanity Fair

Bob Iger returned to Disney as CEO in November ending Bob Chapek's rocky tenure.

The change comes as Disney contends with mounting financial challenges and likely layoffs in 2023.

Here's everything you need to know about what led to Chapek's ouster and what comes next.

In one of the most dramatic reversals in corporate history the Walt Disney Co. board reinstated Bob Iger as CEO in November ousting his predecessor Bob Chapek.

The return of Iger who had previously served as CEO for 15 years before Chapek took over set off a flood of Wall Street investor notes focused on the challenges facing Iger — analysts and Hollywood industry observers also scrutinized Chapek's rocky tenure and his selection as CEO.

Here's a rundown of what led to the change at the top of one of America's most beloved companies and the challenges that lie ahead for Iger in what was announced to be a two-year tenure from finding a new successor to fixing Disney's streaming business and repairing the company's relationships with Hollywood.

What went wrong under Chapek and how Iger's return happened

Iger's return cut short the tenure of his protege Bob Chapek who had spent less than three years in the role. Insider reported that Disney executives had complained to the company's board about Chapek's leadership.

Chapek's fumbles were wide-ranging. Disney had just reported a $1.5 billion loss in its streaming business on a November 8 earnings call. Earlier in the year the company faced backlash from customers over price increases at its theme parks. Separately employees walked out in protest over Disney's reluctance to take a strong stance against Florida's ""Don't Say Gay"" law.

Chapek had also alienated creative execs and Hollywood by taking content budgets away from creative execs at Disney and by releasing movies on streaming at the same time as in theaters during the pandemic; the move resulted in a high-profile legal spat with Scarlett Johansson and her reps.

The company also faced pressure from activist investors like Daniel Loeb to cut costs and make big strategy changes.

It didn't help that Chapek while he was considered an effective operator was also seen as less charismatic and communicative than his popular predecessor. Wall Street faulted him for waiting until after the 3Q earnings call to announce that layoffs were planned for example.

More on Chapek's tenure and Iger's shocking return:

Why Iger's top priority will be a solid succession plan

Iger's return reassured employees who were familiar with the Disney vet but also drew criticism considering his previous remit as CEO included finding and grooming his replacement. So the pressure's on for him to carry through on that task before his two-year contract is up (though the board could always extend his contract again considering it already did so four times before).

During Chapek's first year as CEO Iger remained as executive chairman of the company and there were tensions between the two executives. The Wall Street Journal reported that Iger undermined Chapek's leadership.

While many in Hollywood cheered Iger's reinstatement the move also quickly drew criticism from some on Wall Street over Disney's succession planning and questions about whether the company even has execs who could be groomed to succeed him in two years.

How Iger can strengthen Disney's streaming business and control costs

Iger returns to a streaming landscape that's more competitive since he left with new entrants like Netflix's ad-supported tier fighting for viewers' share of wallet. Disney which in December launched its own ad-supported Disney+ offering has enjoyed strong streaming growth but Wall Street cares more about profitability now.

Iger previously scored wins for Disney with acquisitions of Lucasfilm Pixar and other companies but told Disney staffers at a November meeting not to expect more big acquisitions. He also said a hiring freeze announced by Chapek would remain in effect.

Stepping up to lead the company amid a tough economic environment Iger will have to address not only steep losses in Disney's streaming business but also big decisions like whether to seek full ownership of Hulu now part-owned by Comcast; how to manage content distribution across Hulu and Disney+; and whether to keep or sell ESPN.

How a sluggish box office and talent demands will create new challenges for Iger

Iger wasted no time in making changes ousting Kareem Daniel — the exec who led distribution under Chapek's unpopular business restructure — and announcing plans to give Disney creative executives more power.

But he also has to deal with a box office business that's been scarred by the pandemic and mollify Hollywood talent still miffed by some of Chapek's moves. Recent animation releases have flopped and there's been a slowdown in Star Wars releases.

Long considered one of Hollywood's most successful CEOs Iger will need to marshal all of his business acumen cultural savvy and management skills to usher Disney through a challenging economic landscape and transition the company to a strong new leader.

Many fans have voiced their opinions on social media and have rather intense takes on Disney’s “wokeness.” Over the past two years Disney has been embroiled in the political drama. Disney has been accused of being too inclusive according to some fans at times and has been blamed as a leader of the “cancel culture” movement.

Due to this viewpoint from some Americans the New Tolerance Campaign’s (NTC) 2022 “Worst of the Woke” list has decided to include The Walt Disney Company in its top 10 ranking for the second year in a row according to a report published by Fox News.

The NTC would go on to claim that Disney deserved to return to the list this year due to its opposition to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’ parental rights in an education bill dubbed by the media and liberal groups as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill. Here is the official award announced from the NTC below:

In 2022 now-ousted CEO Bob Chapek gave a master class on how not to respond to woke demands. Following the passage of Florida’s Parental Rights in Education bill (erroneously yet ubiquitously branded by the media as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill) Chapek demurred when Disney employees demanded the company condemn the legislation rightly asserting that “corporate statements do very little to change outcomes or minds.” Weeks later Disney did an about-face declaring the company would support organizations seeking to “replace” the law or have it “struck down in the courts.” Florida legislators and Governor Ron DeSantis responded by stripping Disney of special taxation and self-governance perks it’s enjoyed for decades. The public wasn’t buying Disney’s activism either — quite literally. Following a string of box office bombs in November Disney abruptly announced Chapek would be stepping down as CEO making way for his predecessor Bob Iger to return. Iger stepped back into the role of chief executive committing to “quiet” the obsession with cultural issues at the entertainment powerhouse and “respect” consumers of their content.

Many news outlets cite Disney’s “woke agenda” as the reason for the company’s recent decline but that’s not an entirely accurate statement. The definition of “woke” varies from person to person and media making it a very fluid term. Minnie Mouse changing her outfit and higher inclusion efforts might be new changes but they hardly constitute something that would break the company. However despite what the sharks of social media might rip and tear over the real problem isn’t Disney being woke but losing touch with its audience.

Because of the decision by former Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Chapek to lobby against the bill supported by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis Walt Disney World was stripped of its preferred tax status in its Reedy Creek district earlier this year.

In a recent report newly reappointed Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger expressed his concerns about the damaged relationship between the Walt Disney Company and the state of Florida. He also said in a recent interview that he believed the company’s leanings should lie in the aftermath of the controversy brought on by Disney’s political involvement by stating “It can be distracting and it can have a negative impact on the company. And to the extent that I can work to kind of quiet things down I’m going to do that.”

As Walt Disney World The Walt Disney Company and Disney CEO Bob Iger welcome in 2023 it will be fascinating to see how the company handles the political drama moving forward.

Officials for each jurisdiction held public hearings and approved the rate adjustments over the past two months according to the San Rafael-based waste hauler.

The rate increases are part of the hauler’s service agreements with each jurisdiction and are calculated based on the consumer price index adjustments and other factors said Garth Schultz principal of R3 Consulting Group Inc. a waste management consulting firm that produced a rate study.

“Those include adjustments to rate elements for collection disposal composting recycling compliance with state and local requirements and adjustments resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic” Schultz said in an email.

Subscriptions have been down during the pandemic and Marin Sanitary Service also experienced a major outbreak that disrupted operations. More than 40 workers at the company tested positive for COVID-19 in June 2020 the company said.

“The COVID impacts could fill a blue book” said Patty Garbarino company president. “It’s safe to say that we made it through — and all are healthy and well now.”

In San Rafael rates will increase by 7.15% over 2022 levels for all ratepayers in the city. The increase is the highest in the company’s service area. For a residential 32-gallon trash bin the new monthly rate is $50.19.

The company received forgiveness for its Paycheck Protection Program loan in 2020. However the company had a shortfall of $613327 in 2021 billed revenues which is affecting the new rates according to a San Rafael city staff report.

This is also the third and final year of an increase in San Rafael’s refuse vehicle impact fees which are increasing by $345667 contributing 1.3% to the overall rate increase according to the city.

Over the past 10 years rate hikes for the city have ranged from less than 1% to more than 9% with the average equaling 4.71% annually. Last year’s increase was 2.39% and included an illegal-dumping pilot project according to a city staff report.

Rates are increasing 5.45% in Larkspur; 6.28% in Ross 5.89% in San Anselmo; 5.06% in Fairfax; and 6.17% in the Las Gallinas Valley Sanitary District.

All increases apply to residential and commercial properties.

For residential 32-gallon trash bins that will mean a monthly rate of $54.04 in Larkspur; $46.16 in Ross; $54.30 in San Anselmo; $47.61 in Fairfax; and $43.93 in the Las Gallinas Valley Sanitary District.

The Marin County Board of Supervisors is expected to consider a rate adjustment proposal after the new year Schultz said."

Logo of Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co is seen in Tokyo

TOKYO (Reuters) - Three Japanese insurance companies that are set to halt marine coverage of risks related to the war in Ukraine starting next month are in talks with reinsurers to resume those operations they said on Monday.

Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Sompo Japan Insurance and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance on Friday told shipowners that they would stop offering marine war insurance which covers damage to ships from war in Russian waters from Jan. 1 spokespeople at the companies said. Their comments confirmed local media reports on Saturday.

The change could affect Japan's imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) among other energy and commodities.

The insurers' decision was prompted by global reinsurance companies saying they would no longer take on vessels' risks related to the war which Moscow began in February. The Russian government calls it a ""special operation"".

""We are negotiating with various reinsurers to get the war coverage in order to restart providing marine war insurance in the area to our customers"" a spokespeople at Tokio Marine said adding that some reinsurers have responded ""positively.""

Sompo Japan and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance are also searching for new reinsurers their spokespeople said.

Most vessels get two types of insurance: marine insurance covering damage from natural disasters and collisions and marine war insurance covering damage from war or terrorism.

Without marine war insurance shipowners may give up operations in Russian waters including picking up LNG from the Sakhalin-2 gas and oil project in Russia's Far East.

Japanese shipping company Mitsui OSK Lines said it is gathering information. Nippon Yusen will cooperate with the government and business partners a spokesperson said when asked about its shipping plan from Sakhalin-2.

The Sakhalin Island complex partly owned by Gazprom and Japanese trading houses accounts for 9% of Japan's LNG imports.

Financial institution recruiters and tech executives consider location organizational structure and reporting structure when they are filling or applying for top technologist roles said Robert Voth managing director at executive search firm Russell Reynolds.

""COVID reset the chess table with a piece that companies had never seen before which is open location"" Voth said. ""Prior to the spring of 2020 the vast majority of CIOs moved to corporate headquarters. At the end of 2022 less than half of our searches required their chief information officer to be at corporate.""

About 70% of companies want their top technologist based at headquarters according to Jesse Reich an executive director of Russell Reynolds. In contrast about the same percentage of talent is unmotivated to relocate.

Additionally Voth said reporting structure is vital. He added that companies that don't have their chief technologists reporting to the top executive officers lose more than half of the potential talent pool.

Control of data and analytics is what Voth called ""the bait that hooks the big fish."" Top technologists want oversight because data is the key to a better understanding of customers Reich said.

Even as economic strain on the tech industry has meant more layoffs at many fintechs and Big tech companies the executive technology roles at financial institutions have remained stable Reich said.

""If you need a top technology officer you still need one in a downturn"" Reich said. ""You might have different priorities you might want to digitize your supply chain for efficiencies you might want to be moving more aggressively to the cloud and to better control your infrastructure costs…I don't necessarily think that we did fewer of those searches this year than we did last year but their priorities may have changed and their team sizes have changed.""

Read more

NEW YORK — Is James Harden seriously considering a return to the Houston Rockets in free agency? Or is the 76ers point guard letting the team know there will be no discount this time around?

We’ll find out in negotiations this summer. But ESPN reported the former an hour before the Sixers faced the New York Knicks in a Christmas Day game on Sunday at Madison Square Garden.

“I’m here” Harden said following the Sixers’ 119-112 victory over the Knicks. “We are playing very well. And I don’t know where the report came from. But I’m very excited to be here. We are playing well and we’re continuing to get better.”

The future Hall of Famer was in no mood to talk about the report hours earlier.

Asked before the game about the report Harden responded: “What report?”

Harden said he didn’t know what the reporter was talking about. He also became agitated when asked about the report that he was considering going back to Houston.

“Why would you ask me about that on Christmas man?” he said. “You didn’t say Merry Christmas or nothing. You asked me about something that I ain’t even … I’m not answering. I didn’t see nothing.”

Later told why the question had to be asked Harden responded: ”I’m not talking right now before the game.”

Harden signed a two-year $68.6 million contract with the Sixers on July 27. He has a player option for the 2023-24 season which enables him to become a free agent this summer.

Harden opted out of a $47.4 million player option this summer to re-sign with the Sixers. He’s making $33 million this season. The pay cut he accepted created enough cap space to sign his former teammates and friends P.J. Tucker Danuel House Jr. and Montrezl Harrell in free agency.

He played a little over eight seasons in Houston before forcing a trade to the Brooklyn Nets on Jan. 13 2021. Harden one of the Rockets’ all-time best players won the 2018 NBA MVP award and three scoring titles as a Rocket.

Harden finished with 29 points 13 assists and four steals against the Knicks on Sunday.

After a rocky to start this season he and Joel Embiid have formed a dominant All-NBA pairing. The Sixers are 8-1 since his return with the only loss coming at Houston in his first game back from a foot injury. During the Sixers’ current eight-game winning streak Harden 33 is averaging 21.6 points 12.8 assists and 1.8 steals (including four steals against the Knicks).

If he opts out this summer Harden could demand a lot of money from the Sixers if he is indeed considering going back to the Rockets. Houston will have a lot of cap space this summer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2RlYWxzLXJlY2Vzc2lvbi1ob2xseXdvb2Qtc2VsbGVycy0xMjM1Mjg2NTU0L9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2RlYWxzLXJlY2Vzc2lvbi1ob2xseXdvb2Qtc2VsbGVycy0xMjM1Mjg2NTU0L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hollywood’s Deal Dilemma for 2023: Go Big or Wait Out the Downturn?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.hollywoodreporter.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /business/business-news/deals-recession-hollywood-sellers-1235286554/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021223B2AE00>, 'Connection to www.hollywoodreporter.com timed out.

In an interview with crypto journalist Laura Shin on her podcast Unchained Shkreli describes Bankman-Fried as 'effeminate' and worries for the embattled financier.

Shkreli who drew widespread scorn for drastically hiking prices on his company's drugs was convicted of securities fraud in 2017 and sentenced to seven years in prison.

Released in May this year the 39-year-old said while the advice 'sounds funny' it could mean the difference between life or death.

'Sam isn't exactly gonna be somebody that fit into prison you know my advice for him includes shaving his head my advice for him includes deepening his voice' Shkreli said.

'Sam is going to have a lot of issues because he is a bit of an effeminate guy and his demeanour some people say autistic sort of sense or sensibility is not something that goes over well in prison.'

Bankman-Fried the 30-year-old former billionaire founder of the collapsed crypto firm FTX was arrested in the Bahamas earlier this month and extradited to the United States.

FTX is in bankruptcy proceedings after losing billions of dollars of customer funds that were allegedly funneled to a cryptocurrency firm Bankman-Fried also founded called Alameda Research.

The eight charges against Bankman-Fried include wire fraud wire fraud conspiracy securities fraud securities fraud conspiracy and money laundering.

The former hedge fund executive became the symbol of Wall Street greed and excess after his company purchased and raised the price of the AIDS drug Daraprim by 5000 percent

Bankman-Fried is facing an eight-count federal indictment that could see him sentenced to up to 115 years in prison if convicted of the maximum sentence

'He also doesn't know anything about the streets and sort of criminal culture which my advice to him is to pick those things up as quickly as he can' Shkreli continued.

'He should be listening to as much rap music as possible he should be trying to learn everything there is to know about gangs about the tough neighborhoods in every single city.

'This sounds funny but this could save your life.'

In the full episode Shkreli also advised that Bankman-Fried should try to 'rebrand' or 'reinvent' himself.

'He probably should no longer say that he's from Stamford or something he can say that he's from Oakland I think that people would rather hear him lie than hear the truth' he said.

'Even if they know it's a bit of a lie he should probably start to reinvent his background and history because the rich white kid from a good neighborhood that story doesn't sound great.

'You need people to be on your team it's hard to be authentic but also be in this space where you're making a lot of friends and friends can go a long way in prison.'

Bankman-Fried resigned from his position at FTX in November when the company filed for bankruptcy protection

He was arrested in the Bahamas and extradited to the U.S. on a range of fraud and money laundering charges

The former hedge fund executive became the symbol of Wall Street greed and excess after his company purchased and raised the price of the AIDS drug Daraprim by 5000 percent.

Shkreli left prison May 18 and was in a halfway house until mid-September.

Shkreli built close relationships with Wall Street investors as he worked to build his hedge fund business.

But prosecutors said he lied to them as he raised money for two of his hedge funds MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare.

Prosecutors said he launched a multiyear scheme to loot other enterprises he founded in order to repay investors and hide his failed stock bets.

His attorneys told the court to show leniency at sentencing portraying Shkreli as a misunderstood man who suffered from depression and anxiety.

They argued that he had not harmed vulnerable people but rather that his victims were rich investors who ultimately made a healthy profit.

He was banned from ever working in the pharmaceutical industry again and ordered to pay $64.6 million in wrongfully obtained profits.

Vyera the company he used to acquire Daraprim agreed to pay as much as $40 million to settle price-gouging allegations brought by the Federal Trade Commission and seven states.

Bankman-Fried appeared to be living a life of luxury after pictures emerged of the FTX founder who was released on a $250 million bond relaxing at JFK's American Airlines Flagship lounge

Bankman-Fried was later seen without shoes in business class seat on a AA flight

Bankman-Fried is facing an eight-count federal indictment that could see him sentenced to up to 115 years in prison if convicted of the maximum sentence.

Former U.S. Attorney Nick Akerman who prosecuted white-collar crime for the Southern District of New York told TIME that he predicts a 10-year sentence if not significantly more.

'My sense is he's going to face some pretty serious time here' said Akerman.

Akerman is not involved in the case but his assessment is based on the allegations in the public indictment.

Bankman-Fried resigned from his position at FTX in November when the company filed for bankruptcy protection.

Lawyers have estimated that the company owes money to more than one million people and organizations. Its top 50 creditors alone are owed $3.1 billion.

Bankman-Fried was released on a $250million bond according to a deal struck in a New York City courtroom last week.

He was arrested in the Bahamas and extradited to the U.S. on a range of fraud and money laundering charges for what prosecutors described as one of the biggest financial crimes in American history.

Images of the 'crypto bro' circulated online of the accused fraudster enjoying a life of luxury while lounging at an American Airlines Flagship lounge at JFK and without shoes in his AA business class seat.

While in the Bahamas pictures emerged of Bankman-Fried living in a penthouse which boasts five bedrooms and a private balcony with lounge and spa.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Why you can trust us.

Updated on 12/26/2022 with new recommendations for a backup drive and current instructions for Windows drive encryption and deleting browser data.

Have an old computer lying around the house? Don't just throw it away. Computers house all sorts of toxins that are bad for the environment and all of us who live in it. Not to mention the personal information – passwords account numbers license keys or registration numbers for software programs addresses and phone numbers medical and prescription information tax returns and other personal documents – that you would rather not fall into the wrong hands.

Here's how to safeguard your personal information and ensure your computer is disposed of properly.

How to delete your personal information

However you choose to dispose of your computer you need to do several things if you don’t want a stranger to access your data.

Save important files

Back up your files or transfer them to a new computer. The least time-consuming way to do this is to invest in an external solid-state drive (SSD). SSDs are more expensive than hard disk drives (HDD) but they are less fragile because they have no moving parts and are less prone to failure according to the most recent Drive Stats report by Backblaze. For an SSD I like the Western Digital My Passport SSD (on sale starting at $94.99 for a 1TB drive check the price on Amazon).

If you're looking for an easy ongoing backup and file syncing solution use a cloud service such as Google Drive (our Top Pick for the Best Cloud Storage Service) iCloud or Microsoft’s OneDrive.

Google Drive gives you 15GB of file storage for free and if you need more you can upgrade to Google the paid version of Google Drive. You can buy 100GB for $1.99 per month ($19.99 per year) 200 GB for $2.99 per month ($29.99 per year) and 2TB for $9.99 per month ($99.99 per year).

OneDrive gives you 5GB of free storage with an option to buy 100GB for a monthly subscription of $1.99 per month or $19.99 per year). You can store up to 1TB of storage for one PC or Mac for $6.99 per month ($69.99 per year) which includes a subscription to Office 365 Personal or 6TB for $9.99 per month ($99.99 per year) which includes the ability to share your store and Office 365 Home for up to 6 users.

Apple iCloud includes 5GB free and if you need more storage you can upgrade to the paid service iCloud+. With iCloud+ you can share your storage with up to five additional family members – people who are set up for Family Sharing. Apple's 50GB plan costs $0.99 per month 200GB runs $2.99 per month and the 2TB option runs $9.99 per month.

After backing up your files in the cloud you can easily transfer them to a new machine or access them anywhere you have an Internet connection including your smartphone. Cloud storage also comes in handy if your computer dies and you need to restore your files or you’re traveling and need access to data on a different device.

“Wipe” your hard drive

Simply deleting files won’t cut it. Even if a file name doesn’t show up on the list of available files the old file data is still there until it is overwritten and a bad guy can use a data recovery program to retrieve it. I've outlined the steps I recommend you take below.

Delete and overwrite sensitive files. If you have tax documents and other sensitive files make sure you delete these files with specialized software designed to meet government standards for secure deletion. For Windows PCs with hard drives try File Shredder (free). For older Macs with hard drives (MacOS X Yosemite version 10.10 or earlier) you can choose the ""Secure Empty Trash"" option after deleting your files. You can find it under Finder > Secure Empty Trash. For Macs with MacOS X El Capitan version 10.11 and higher and Windows PCs with SSD drives you'll need to encrypt your drive. When you wipe your drive at the end of these steps you'll be securely erasing all of your files. Turn on drive encryption. For Windows PCs with SSD drives go to Start button > Settings > Update & Security > Device Encryption. If the option for Device Encryption appears make sure it's on. Otherwise go to Start > Windows System > Control Panel > System and Security > BitLocker Drive Encryption > Manage BitLocker to turn on drive encryption. For Macs go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > FileVault and select ""Turn On FileVault."" You'll then create a password and select Restart. Deauthorize your computer. Some programs such as iTunes and Microsoft Office 365 only allow you to install software on a limited number of computers or allow a limited number of computers to access your files. So be sure to deauthorize your old computer with your accounts – before uninstalling your programs. Delete your browsing history. Most browsers save information about your browsing history and depending on your settings you can choose to store your usernames and passwords for sites. Obviously you don’t want a stranger to have access to this information.



First you'll want to sign out of your browser. For Edge and Chrome click on your profile icon and choose the option to sign out.

For Firefox click on Settings (cog icon in the upper right) > Manage more settings > Sync and sign out.

For Safari you'll need to turn off iCloud. Go to the Apple menu > System Settings [your name] > iCloud and Turn Off Safari. Then clear your browser history.

For Edge you click on the triple dots in the upper right corner to open the browser menu then on Settings > Privacy search and services. In the ""Clear browsing data"" section click on ""Choose what to clear."" In the Time Range pull-down menu choose ""All time."" Make sure all of the checkboxes are selected so everything gets removed.

For Chrome click on the menu icon (triple dots in the upper right) > Settings > Privacy and security > Clear browsing data. In the popup window use the Time range pulldown to select ""All time."" Make sure all of the boxes are checked to ensure everything is removed.

For Firefox click on Settings (cog icon in the upper right) > Manage more settings > Privacy & security. Go through and click on the ""Clear Data box next to all types of data.

For Safari open the Safari app and choose History > Clear History. Uninstall your programs. Some programs such as Microsoft Office may contain personal information such as your name and address or other details. So be sure to uninstall any programs before disposing of your computer. Consult your employer about data disposal policies. If you use your computer for business purposes check with your employer about how to manage business-related information on your computer. The law requires businesses to follow data security and disposal requirements for certain information that’s related to customers. Wipe your hard drive. For PCs once you've gone through and removed the data you know is there it's time to perform a factory reset to ensure you've removed all of your personal files and software programs. If your computer has a hard drive restart the computer download and install Eraser.



Once installed you'll click on the downward pointing arrow next to Erase Schedule select New Task select Run immediately and then click on Add Data. Under Target Type select Unused Disk Space check off Erase cluster tips and click OK. The tool will then permanently delete anything that was deleted during your reset. If your computer has an SSD drive right click on the Windows icon in the lower left corner select Control Panel > System and Security > Administrative Tools > Computer Management > then right click on the disk where you store your files choose New Volume and follow the prompts until you get to the Format window. There you will make sure the quick format is not checked and then format the drive. If you don't have the option to encrypt your drive you can use Blancco Drive Eraser ($18.46 on Blancco) for a full wipe.



For Macs you'll want to erase and reinstall MacOS. The process differs slightly depending on whether your Mac has an Intel chip and whether you're running macOS Monterey or an earlier version. In either case you'll want to make sure your macOS is up to date before starting.



If you have a Mac with an Intel chip in the menu bar choose Apple menu > Restart. Once your Mac restarts (and the gray screen appears) hold down the Command and R keys. Select Disk Utility then click Continue. Select your startup disk on the left then click the Erase tab. Choose MacOS Extended (Journaled) from the Format menu enter a name then click Erase. After the disk is erased choose Disk Utility > Quit Disk Utility. Select Reinstall macOS click Continue then follow the onscreen instructions.



If you have a Mac with an Apple chip or you have a Mac running macOS Monterey with an Apple T2 Security Chip in the menu bar choose Apple menu > Restart. Once your Mac restarts (and the gray screen appears) hold down the Command and R keys. Sign in with administrator user ID. Select Disk Utility and click on Continue. Select Macintosh HD and click on the Erase button. Choose MacOS Extended (Journaled) from the Format menu enter a name then click Erase. After the disk is erased choose Disk Utility > Quit Disk Utility. Select Reinstall macOS click Continue then follow the onscreen instructions.



For Chromebooks you'll need to perform a factory reset. To do that sign into your Chromebook with the owner account (if you have more than one account loaded). From the Taskbar click on Settings > Advanced > Powerwash > Restart. After your Chromebook restarts select ""Powerwash"" and click on ""Continue.""



Or physically damage your hard drive. If you're just looking to recycle your computer and are very concerned about someone recovering your files take the hard drive out and drill a bunch of holes in it or beat the heck out of it with a hammer.

How to dispose of your computer

To avoid all those toxins ending up in a landfill the better choice is to recycle donate trade in or sell your computer.

Recycling your computer

If you opt to recycle it keep in mind that some recyclers will simply take your old machine and ship it over to developing nations where children are often used to scavenge piles of e-waste looking for valuable components. To avoid contributing to this irresponsible practice use a recycler that has been certified by Sustainable Electronics Recycling International (SERI) as meeting the R2 standard or is part of the “e-Steward” network meaning they don’t export to places like Pakistan or China and they follow other high standards. Many of them also will reuse and refurbish electronics. Staples is an e-Steward Enterprise and will recycle laptops and other consumer electronics for free.

Trading-in your computer

As for trading in your PC or laptop there are scads of companies that offer trade-in programs through which you can sell a wide assortment of used electronics. Options include BestBuy and Staples. Your local Best Buy also has trade-in options but compare what it offers against the online services first.

What to do if your computer won't turn on

If your computer is dead chances are it's a problem with the motherboard or the power supply but the hard drive and the data on it should be fine. To back up the data on it and then erase the drive you will need to remove the drive from the dead computer and hook it up to another computer using a SATA to USB cable (you can get a SATA to USB cable for under $25 on Amazon). Once plugged in the new computer should recognize and map your old drive at which point you can just copy the files off and then run Eraser to wipe the drive.

Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. Getty/Getty

Johnny Depp's defamation lawsuit against Amber Heard — and her subsequent counterclaim — was one of the most highly publicized and intensely discussed pieces of litigation this year.

An entire subgenre of TikTokers and internet influencers rose to prominence covering the trial while a wave of creators gained traction making fancams and compilations in support of Depp or mocking Heard. The internet and influencers responded to the trial overwhelmingly in support of Depp and the ""Justice for Johnny Depp"" TikTok hashtag amassed over 21 billion views. Many people shared clips closely dissecting aspects of the case and the trial.

The trial lasted two months and put for the claim that Heard had defamed Depp and ruined his reputation by alleging she was the victim of abuse in a 2018 Washington Post op-ed. The jury ruled largely in favor of Depp awarding him over $10 million in damages.

Misinformation swarmed across the internet with a seemingly endless amount of baseless theories takes and memes related to Depp and Heard to be found online and creators profited from taking a hard line in the case.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndvd2t0di5jb20vbmV3cy93ZXN0LXZpcmdpbmlhL2thbmF3aGEtY291bnR5LXd2L3doeS1pcy10aGVyZS1hLWJpZy1ib3ktc3RhdHVlLWluLWNoYXJsZXN0b24td2VzdC12aXJnaW5pYS_SAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy53b3drdHYuY29tL25ld3Mvd2VzdC12aXJnaW5pYS9rYW5hd2hhLWNvdW50eS13di93aHktaXMtdGhlcmUtYS1iaWctYm95LXN0YXR1ZS1pbi1jaGFybGVzdG9uLXdlc3QtdmlyZ2luaWEvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why is there a Big Boy statue in Charleston West Virginia?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wowktv.com/news/west-virginia/kanawha-county-wv/why-is-there-a-big-boy-statue-in-charleston-west-virginia/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndvd2t0di5jb20vbmV3cy93ZXN0LXZpcmdpbmlhL2thbmF3aGEtY291bnR5LXd2L3doeS1pcy10aGVyZS1hLWJpZy1ib3ktc3RhdHVlLWluLWNoYXJsZXN0b24td2VzdC12aXJnaW5pYS_SAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy53b3drdHYuY29tL25ld3Mvd2VzdC12aXJnaW5pYS9rYW5hd2hhLWNvdW50eS13di93aHktaXMtdGhlcmUtYS1iaWctYm95LXN0YXR1ZS1pbi1jaGFybGVzdG9uLXdlc3QtdmlyZ2luaWEvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5leGNoYW5nZTRtZWRpYS5jb20vcGVvcGxlLW1vdmVtZW50LW5ld3MvYW1hci11amFsYS1ncm91cC1uYW1lcy1uYWplZWItc2lkZGlxdWktYXMtaGVhZC1zYWxlcy13ZXN0LXJlc3Qtb2YtbWV0cm9zLTEyNDQ1MC5odG1s0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4Y2hhbmdlNG1lZGlhLmNvbS9hbXAvcGVvcGxlLW1vdmVtZW50LW5ld3MvYW1hci11amFsYS1ncm91cC1uYW1lcy1uYWplZWItc2lkZGlxdWktYXMtaGVhZC1zYWxlcy13ZXN0LXJlc3Qtb2YtbWV0cm9zLTEyNDQ1MC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amar Ujala Group names Najeeb Siddiqui as Head Sales West & Rest of Metros,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.exchange4media.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /people-movement-news/amar-ujala-group-names-najeeb-siddiqui-as-head-sales-west-rest-of-metros-124450.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000021226E51570>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5leGNoYW5nZTRtZWRpYS5jb20vcGVvcGxlLW1vdmVtZW50LW5ld3MvYW1hci11amFsYS1ncm91cC1uYW1lcy1uYWplZWItc2lkZGlxdWktYXMtaGVhZC1zYWxlcy13ZXN0LXJlc3Qtb2YtbWV0cm9zLTEyNDQ1MC5odG1s0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4Y2hhbmdlNG1lZGlhLmNvbS9hbXAvcGVvcGxlLW1vdmVtZW50LW5ld3MvYW1hci11amFsYS1ncm91cC1uYW1lcy1uYWplZWItc2lkZGlxdWktYXMtaGVhZC1zYWxlcy13ZXN0LXJlc3Qtb2YtbWV0cm9zLTEyNDQ1MC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

UCLA boasts four 2022 VolleyballMag.com Boys Fab 50 selections and has two of the Class of 2022â€™s top recruits in Arizona product Zach Rama (No. 2) and standout setter Andrew Rowan (No. 3). One voter labeled both Rama and Rowan as two future national-team players.

Previously the Bruins logged top recruiting classes for a three-year run from 2017-2019 and then took runner-up honors in 2020 and 2021. In the last seven years UCLA has registered four No. 1 classes a pair of No. 2s and a third-place class (2016).

UCLA and coach John Speraw racked up all but one first-place vote this time around.

In the 2022 voting there was a clear-cut delineation between the high upper tier and the rest of the top 10. These annual recruiting class rankings are voted on by a panel of NCAA Division I-II coaches.Â

USC under the direction of Jeff Nygaard takes runner-up honors this year after a No. 9-ranked recruiting class in 2021 and earning honorable-mention honors in 2020. This is the Trojansâ€™ top class since a No. 3 ranking in 2017. This yearâ€™s USC class is highlighted by outside hitter Dillon Klein who was tabbed the top recruit in the class of 2022 by the Boys Fab 50 voting panel.

Long Beach State which reached the national championship match last spring continues its strong run of top classes checking in this time at No. 3. In addition to wins in 2021 and 2020 the 49ers had the No. 3-ranked class in 2019 and the No. 5-ranked class in 2017. Three Long Beach State recruits made this yearâ€™s VBM Boys Fab 50 list in 2022 while a fourth Ryan Peluso was a VBM boys high school All-American first-team pick.

The rest of the top five this year features Stanford at No. 4 and Ohio State in the No. 5 position. This is Stanfordâ€™s highest ranking since a runner-up finish in 2019. The Cardinal had the top recruiting class in 2016 and was also runner-up in 2017.

Ohio State was fourth last year eighth in 2020 and 10th in 2019. Itâ€™s the Buckeyesâ€™ highest finish since a No. 4-ranked class in 2016.

Pepperdine has been a constant with No. 3 (2018) No. 4 (2019) No. 7 (2020) and No. 5 (2021). Princeton had two recent strong classes at No. 5 (2020) and No. 6 (2021) while national-champion Hawaiâ€™i checked in with classes at No. 7 (2018) No. 8 (2019) No. 9 (2020) and honorable mention last season. Ball State an honorable-mention pick this time hadnâ€™t been in the rankings since 2017 (honorable mention). North Greenville the seventh team in the 2022 national field has not appeared in the rankings.

I had come for a few days this past fall dutifully overloading my senses and depleting my wallet every time I left my hotel room. But at a dinner one night with a large group of colleagues I heard the first rumblings of discontent and unfulfilled wishes. ""You wouldn't"" the woman next to me at our table asked the waiter gently ""just happen by any chance to have Coke?"" He shook his head. She'd already guessed as much.

""Am I tripping or is everything here Pepsi products?""

Vegas is a Pepsi town — so much a Pepsi town that it's one of the few places in the world that's ever served Pepsi in some of its McDonald's locations. If you go on travel forums you will discover spirited discussions about how tricky it can be to find a Coke or as one Redditor put is earlier this year ""Am I tripping or is everything here Pepsi products?"" And if you Google ""Las Vegas Pepsi"" your results will produce the plaintive ""Why is there no Coke in Las Vegas?"" Naturally once I realized this I wanted nothing else from Sin City but an icy bottle of the Real Thing.

There is in fact Coke to be found in Vegas most notably in some higher-end properties like the Bellagio. There is even a Coca-Cola store on the Strip so you won't be deprived if that's your preference. But as the Vital Vegas guide noted back in 2019 ""The Strip is Pepsi dominated as the big casino companies have deals with Pepsi."" Caesars properties for instance are Pepsi zones. And with Pepsi comes its suite of other beverages — handy to know if you're a fan of Mountain Dew. But considering the deluge of advertising for Bacardi I encountered in my hotel I did find myself wondering if my cocktail hour plans might have to include a rum and…. Pepsi.

Pepsi's relationship with the town shows up in other ways. In 2020 PepsiCo launched its Dig In initiative to support Black owned restaurants across the country which just this fall featured a Restaurant Royalty Residency program to ""bring signature dishes from Black-owned restaurants"" to MGM properties in Las Vegas.

In hindsight I can see how Pepsi with its somewhat edgier brand identity is a natural fit for Vegas. It likewise checks out that wholesome all-American Coke in contrast dominates the happiest place on earth.

The Disney relationship goes back to before there were even Disney theme parks. As Chelsea Burnett Alliance Manager of Disney Corporate Alliances wrote on the Disney Parks blog last year ""Our relationship with Coca-Cola started in 1942 when Walt Disney first appeared on the Coca-Cola radio program 'The Pause That Refreshes on the Air.'"" Coke was on the menu when Disneyland opened back in 1955 but it's been the parks' exclusive beverage provider since the 1980's. Today the company's products are ubiquitous in Disney parks all around the world.

Theme parks and casinos are of course just a larger manifestation of the kind of corporate contracts that not so subtly guide our recreational consumption choices. Julian Goldie CEO of the SEO link-building Goldie Agency notes ""A movie theater may enter into a partnership with a particular soda brand and exclusively serve that brand in their concessions or an amusement park may be sponsored by a particular snack food company and feature their products throughout the park. Brands can often guide our choices through strategic product placement and promotional efforts. For example a casino may prominently display certain brands of beverages near popular gaming areas or a music venue may offer discounts on certain brands of drinks as part of a special promotion."" Or Caesars may choose like it did this spring the High Roller wheel as the perfect place to launch a Pepsi Nitro pop-up experience. The result as Steven Zhang founder of the tea culture blog TeaJust notes is that ""these tactics create an association between the brand and the experience of enjoying a night out.""

If you're very a brand-loyal traveler you might want to do some advance work before you take off so you're not already ordering room service before you learn that Pepsi is the drink of choice in Marriott's over 6300 properties. And if you're thirsty for the thing that refreshes you most you might have to get out and stock up. Matt James of the travel blog Visitingly suggests ""If you are in a 'Coke town' and want a Pepsi you can usually find one at a convenience store or grocery store. You may also be able to request a different brand of soda at restaurants or bars although they may not always have it available."" When all else fails you can always just order something else — but it wouldn't be quite the same right?

I am not enough of a soda consumer to usually care — or notice — the soft drink culture of a particular town or resort. (I have however been known to get feisty about the beer offerings at certain stadiums.) But the elusiveness of Coke in Vegas made it absolutely tantalizing to me. There Coca-Cola glittered like an effervescent dream in my imagination as out of reach as a row of cherries on a slot machine. I bought a bottle at my bodega when I got home. It was okay. But like so many things about Las Vegas getting it wasn't as good as wanting it had been.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9uMy5jb20vY29sbGVnZS90ZXhhcy1hbS1hZ2dpZXMvbmV3cy90ZXhhcy1hbS1iYXNrZXRiYWxsLXJvYi1kb2NrZXJ5LWNvbW1pdHMtdG8tYWdnaWVzLWJ1enotd2lsbGlhbXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2024 Four-Star Rob Dockery commits to Texas A&M,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9uMy5jb20vY29sbGVnZS90ZXhhcy1hbS1hZ2dpZXMvbmV3cy90ZXhhcy1hbS1iYXNrZXRiYWxsLXJvYi1kb2NrZXJ5LWNvbW1pdHMtdG8tYWdnaWVzLWJ1enotd2lsbGlhbXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000212236C1090>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

But in 1989 it was “crazy.”

That’s how Elaine Wynn remembers The Mirage’s original signature attraction.

“The volcano was the beginning of a streak of crazy ideas that always came true” Wynn said during a phone chat last week as she remembered opening the hotel alongside her then-husband Steve Wynn in November 1989. “These ideas were compelling and part of a pattern we established with all of our properties.”

The volcano was needed to fill a more widespread design need at the groundbreaking hotel. The Mirage era effectively ended Dec. 19 when MGM Resorts International announced it closed the sale of the resort’s operations to Hard Rock International which is owned by the Seminole Tribe of Florida.

Plans for the rebranding of Hard Rock Las Vegas are to be announced in the third quarter of next year. That includes the future of the volcano which Hard Rock Las Vegas President Joe Lupo has said he expects will run through 2023.

A volcanic history

The hotel changeover reminds of The Mirage’s trailblazing history beginning with the volcano.

“I remember initially when Steve was designing it he wanted to have The Mirage kind of front-up right onto the Strip” Wynn said. “And I said ‘If you bring it close to the Strip people aren’t going to appreciate the towers. Consider setting it back so that as people walk by and drive by they’ll have a point of view that gives them an appreciation of the whole building.’ We agreed that would be a good idea.”

But that design created a vast expanse between the hotel’s main entrance and the Strip.

“We wondered what is going to be the thing that separates the sidewalk from the porte cochere?” Wynn said. “It was purely Steve’s vision the volcano. He said ‘Let’s do a volcano that sets off fire in the sky!’”

Setting the tone

Elaine Wynn would remain involved in major decisions throughout Steve Wynn’s evolution of Strip resorts including Wynn/Encore. Steve Wynn created that twin resort after buying and demolishing the classic Desert Inn (Steve Wynn had originally purchased the D.I. in 2000 as a birthday present to Elaine).

Today Elaine Wynn is Wynn Resorts’ largest shareholder with an 8.9 percent stake. She notes that momentum of the Wynn brand on the Strip started at The Mirage.

“The Mirage was a wonderful experiment that set the tone for how we did projects and how we moved on from there” Wynn said recalling an early and animated discussion about where to build the guest-room elevators in relation to the casino.

“I remember in the beginning saying ‘My gosh what a bloody long walk from the registration desk in the front to go through the the whole casino to get to the elevator’” Wynn said. “That was also kind of a new thing in Las Vegas that long walk through the casino. But Steve was very insistent that people see the casino before they disappeared into their rooms.”

This led to a lengthy back-and-forth of whether it was a good idea to send guests on the long trudge across the casino to their rooms.

“I remember that was a lively conversation and he won that conversation because he wanted an open casino that when you looked across it you could see it without any columns” Wynn said. “And so if you’ll notice a lot of our properties did not have columns in the middle of the casino which was another design element that I thought was very clever. It deserved to be copied and it was.”

Rolling with the tank

Another unique Mirage feature was the 20000-gallon 50-foot-long aquarium of exotic fish looming behind the front desk (yours truly once joked to a friend visiting that you could order one of those fish to be prepared and delivered by room service). Even the check-in process was an entertainment experience at The Mirage.

“We always thought when people checked into these places and they had to wait in line how tough it would be for them to be patient to have to just stand there” Wynn said. “But when we put in the fish tank it was like they were mesmerized. They did not mind standing there and waiting because they were so busy observing all the beautiful tropical fish.”

Similar to the volcano the aquarium was a classic loss-leader at the hotel. The strategy can still work because that aquarium became a famous customer amenity that did not require a ticket or cover charge.

“It was expensive you know” Wynn said. “We had real-life people that had to service that thing every day. So that was a pretty bold experiment too.”

Wynn evokes the glass-topped tree-lined interior atrium as yet another innovation specific to The Mirage.

“We did major scientific light studies to make sure that once we had the trees in there they would grow and prosper” Wynn said. “Once you put them in there it was hard to get them out.”

The baccarat phenomenon erupted inside The Mirage where an elevated high-limit section was created for the hotel’s VIP players. Both Wynns were stunned at the business baccarat players brought to the hotel.

“You walked up to an area that was specifically a high-limit area and on New Year’s Eve we had so much high-limit baccarat play that we had to convert the blackjack tables that were on the lower level to baccarat tables” Wynn recalled. “We had that kind of business. We were looking at the limits and they were just off the charts. He and I never imagined that it would be so extraordinarily successful with our high-end clientele.”

Much of The Mirage’s impact is felt in the Strip’s entertainment culture. Siegfried & Roy set sales records at the hotel. Siegfried & Roy’s Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat remained open for more than 20 years after the duo’s stage show was canceled. The Beatles-Cirque show “Love” is still the only authorized ticketed Beatles show in the world.

But the habitat has been closed since the death in September of the bottlenose dolphin K2. “Love” is committed to performing through 2023 but its future thereafter is uncertain.

What is certain is the hotel represents a tri-tower of ingenuity in Las Vegas history. As the woman who was there at the start says “It was like we were for the first time creating the coloring book for a megaresort. … A tremendous amount of brainy activity went into the conceptualization of The Mirage.”

Jeff Walsh

Prior to the WPT World Championship at Wynn Las Vegas there was little doubt that the event was going to be a success. Sure there were questions about the $15 million guarantee and how it was all going to go down but when the World Poker Tour brand teamed up with the Wynn all expectations were that the festival was bound to be a hit.

That said the extent to which it overwhelmed the industry provided everyone involved with a delightful surprise. The feedback from beginning to end was nearly universally positive – especially from the players who received world-class treatment throughout.

So when tasked to pull highlights from a festival overrun with highlights it’s nearly impossible to have a complete list. There are simply too many – but we’re going to give it a shot anyway and take one look back at one of the biggest events of 2022.

Stars Electrify Opening Meet-Up Game

The “electric” kick-off event of the WPT World Championship at Wynn Las Vegas festival set the tone for the entire month. Officially dubbed “The Premier Meet-Up Game: WPT Poker Icons Experience” it was essentially the concept created by WPT ambassadors Brad Owen and Andrew Neeme infused with the additional star power of Phil Ivey Patrik Antonius Steve Aoki WPT talent and Doyle Brunson (who received a standing ovation upon arrival). Anyone who was there can attest the energy in the room was palpable as long-time fans batted against some of their poker heroes in an effort to win one of four WPT $10K World Championship seats being given away. The event served as a precursor for a festival that more than lived up to the hype.

WPT Prime Surprises Everybody

“Nobody I don’t think anybody – from WPT from the Wynn – nobody expected that final number” said WPT VP Global Tour Management Angelica Hael

WPT Prime World Poker Tour’s rebrand for their mid-stakes events had a successful launch this year but no one really could have foreseen the heights of the WPT Prime Championship Event at the Wynn. When all was said and done WPT Prime Championship drew 5430 entries – absolutely crushing the advertised $2 million guarantee with its $5.2 million prize pool. The event which many thought would essentially be a prelim to the WPT World Championship turned into a must-play event all on its own.

High Roller Hits 100 ‘Rampage’ Lives Up To His Name

When Ethan Yau was considering whether to take a shot in the WPT World Championship $25K he wondered aloud (on Twitter) if the event would see 100 runners – a field size thought by many to be well out of reach. Not only did the high rollers and shot takers show up and surpass the 100-entry mark (make it 108 to be exact) but Yau decided to be a part of that group. It turned out to be a good decision for the superstar poker vlogger. Yau took two shots and even though he feared he would fall outside the money he battled late into the night to lock up the largest single score of his young career to the delight of his fans and those tuned into the livestream.

The $15M Guarantee…Never In Doubt

From the time Day 1A got started there was optimism among organizers that the $15 million WPT World Championship guarantee was going to be easily met. Some even thought $20 million was possible.

However just 24 hours later at the start of Day 1B the question wasn’t if it was when and before WPT could get a big announcement out that the guarantee had hit $20 million…it was well on its way to $25 million. In the end the prize pool swelled to just over $29 million with players creating a $4.1 million first-place prize – the largest single payday in WPT’s 20-year history.

Also of note: the ripple effect of the World Championship guarantee being surpassed was having so many people ready to fire in other tournaments. All of the side events had elevated prize pools – case in point the two-day $3K No Limit Hold’em with a $500000 guarantee on December 15-16 had 907 entries and a prize pool of $2.5 million.

Daniel’s Deep Run

Even though Daniel Negreanu doesn’t travel with the World Poker Tour these days he’s still a big part of its legacy with two WPT titles and over $5.8 million in WPT earnings – second only to Carlos Mortensen in career WPT earnings.

So when Negreanu one of the game’s biggest stars was making a deep run on Day 4 and Day 5 in the WPT World Championship the eyes of the entire industry were on him. Negreanu became a constant reoccurring presence on the WPT Livestream keeping the proceedings light and entertaining even when the pressure intensified. With just three tables left in the tournament on Day 5 it looked like he had a real shot at being in the mix at the very end. However Negreanu took a staggering bad beat in 17th place when his flopped set of deuces got run down on the river to finish in 17th place for $176200 – his most significant WPT score since 2015.

Qualifiers Gunna Qualify

Negreanu wasn’t the only big name to show up at the Wynn. On the contrary it seemed like all of the biggest names in the game made their way to Sin City for the winter. Joining the marquee names though were hundreds upon hundreds of qualifiers who had won their way online through WPT Global and ClubWPT. Perhaps even more impressive were the hordes of players that won their way into festival events through the Wynn’s Milestone satellites.

These Milestone satellites proved to be immensely popular. Rather than play down to a specific number of winners it encouraged aggression by awarding seats when players reached a specific chip count. The majority if not all of them crushed the number of seats they guaranteed including a 50-seat guaranteed satellite that awarded roughly 110 seats.

Women Came To Play

The WPT’s commitment to making the game of poker more inclusive was on display at the festival. The schedule featured another Meet-Up Game exclusively for women spearheaded by Jaime Kerstetter as well as the first-ever WPT Ladies Championship with a $200000 guarantee the largest in history for a women’s event. And the women in the poker community responded by showing up in force for the Meet-Up game and crushing the Ladies Championship guarantee to the tune of $560660.

In addition to Lina Niu winning her first WPT title in the Ladies Event for more than $105136 women were as they always are a major part of all aspects of the festival. From Lara Eisenberg finishing runner-up in the WPT Prime Championship to LoriAnn Persinger a qualifier finishing in 30th in the World Championship for $119300 there was no shortage of major scores for women. Don’t forget legendary tournament pro Kathy Liebert cashed in all of the Championship events including a final table in the Ladies Event. And in the end Cherish Andrews locked up the Player of the Festival with a strong run late in the series. For those that care about both growth and diversity in the game of poker there were wins everywhere you looked.

Kilbane & Co. Crush the WPT Livestream

Obviously not everyone in the poker world could make it to the Wynn this December. But for those at home WPT did everything they could to make fans feel they were a part of the action with a world-class stream expertly anchored by Henry Kilbane. The WPT Livestream was must-see TV with a variety of offerings from the vlogger game to the nosebleed stakes of Rail Heaven.

All of the cash game offerings were stellar but the broadcast took off when the World Championship took center stage giving people the heart of the historic tournament. In the end poker enthusiasts had a front-row seat to history.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBpdGFuZHF1YXJyeS5jb20vbG9hZGVkLWluZHVzdHJ5LWNhbGVuZGFyLW9uLXRhcC1mb3ItMjAyMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Loaded industry calendar on tap for 2023,"About the Author: Jack Kopanski

Ever since we learned of plans to bring Formula 1 back to Las Vegas we always knew it was going to predominantly target the rich and famous folk of this world. We didn’t quite realise we would be reaching these astronomical prices…

Hot on the heels of Wynn Las Vegas’ $1million package which now looks like an absolute bargain is a $5million ‘Emperor Package’ unveiled by Caesars Entertainment.

You will start off by spending five nights in a luxury suite at the Premier Inn no sorry the 10300-square-foot three-bedroomed Nobu Sky Villa which offers panoramic views of the track and enough space to fit 75 people to watch all the action alongside you.

Michelin-starred chef Nobu Matsuhisa will be on hand to specially curate a menu for you (we’re presuming you will have to specifically request chicken nuggets and chips) and you will also have access to a 24-hour butler and a driver who will cruise you around in a Rolls Royce.

You also get 12 tickets to the F1 Paddock Club and Pit Lane Walk whilst six of you can go to the Nobu Sky Villa’s Qua Baths & Spa for any treatment you fancy.

A personal VIP host will organise experiences for you at all Caesars Entertainment’s Las Vegas resorts including food and beverage offerings across the city and OMNIA Nightclub at Caesars Palace and you will also be granted seven-star tier status on Caesars Rewards list.

And if that isn’t enough for you you will also get two tickets to watch Adele at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace. Talk about taking rolling in the deep to a whole new level.

You can head here for more information on this eye-watering Las Vegas Grand Prix package. We were also expecting you to become the 21st driver on the grid for the weekend but they must be reserving that for the $10million ‘Super Emperor’ package.

In a completely unrelated matter we would just like to say we are big fans of Caesars Palace and although we know it would be tough we would be willing to write up a review of the ‘Emperor Package’ in order to fully inform Formula 1 fans before they click add to basket.

It’s hard work but somebody has to do it.

Over the upcoming years the market for distributed energy resource management systems is anticipated to be driven by an increase in distributed energy resources a transition from centralised to distributed generation and falling solar PV & energy storage costs. The market is comprehensively evaluated in the report on the global distributed energy resource management system market. The research provides a thorough analysis of the market's key segments trends drivers restraints competitive environment and other important elements.Cutting-edge system that effortlessly incorporates high solar energy penetration rates and various distributed energy resources into the grid. Their capabilities provide businesses and their clients with a variety of advantages when used effectively. It comprises of a collection of software management tools that allow wire operators and distribution services to manage a variety of DERs and so contribute to the control of grid assets in close to real-time. In addition it is described as a control system that enables the grid and distributed energy resources to be controlled optimally. This includes skills like power quality management Volt/VAR optimization (VVO) and the coordination of DER dispatch to support operational requirements. Further delivery controlled grid services involves controlling power and voltage along with individual feeders providing the advantage of precise control over a variety of devices including smart inverters on-load tap changers capacitor banks voltage regulators (VRegs) and customer loads.Get Exclusive Sample Copy of This Report Here:a real-time communications network for managing and controlling dispersed energy resources connected to the utility locally. By adjusting power and voltage together with particular feeders it provides controlled grid services that give businesses exact control over a variety of equipment including smart inverters capacitor banks on-load tap changers voltage regulators (VRegs) and customer loads. In contrast to VPPs this aids in the control of DERs' active power contributions on a larger system-wide scale. Grid functions like demand response operating reserves and frequency management are provided by VPPs.Additionally DERMS manages local grid events. This is so that a DERMS can correctly target particular distribution system assets as it knows exactly where each asset is located on the system. This for instance enables the DERMS to control equipment downstream of defined transformers or measured points on feeder lines so that in the event that a utility or company encounters difficulties as a result of too many renewable energy sources coming online the system knows precisely which assets to control to lessen the associated issues. Smart inverters or more conventional utility control equipment are included with these assets. The DERMS can use a high level of control over real power (watts) voltage and reactive power thanks to this location-driven emphasis (VARs). Due to its capacity to handle a significant volume of scattered Assets can move to a grid that is more adaptable and durable.Given the proliferation of renewable energy sources this is of utmost importance. For instance by optimising DERs such as client loads on the grid voltage swings that result from the high unpredictability of PV can be effectively managed.Market SegmentationGlobal Energy Storage Distributed Energy Resource Management System Market: Major PlayersSchneider ElectricOpen Access Technology International Inc.Sunverge Energy IncABB LtdSpirae Inc.Blue Pillar Inc.Enbala Power Networks Inc.Siemens AGAutogrid Systems Inc.General ElectricDoosan Gridtech Inc.Global Energy Storage Distributed Energy Resource Management System Market: By TypesSolar PVWindEnergy StorageCombined Heat & PowerOthersGlobal Energy Storage Distributed Energy Resource Management System Market: By ApplicationsGovernment & MunicipalitiesIndustrialCommercialResidentialMilitaryPurchase This Report:Global Energy Storage Distributed Energy Resource Management System Market: Regional AnalysisAll the regional segmentation has been studied based on recent and future trends and the market is forecasted throughout the prediction period.

Australia's fake American ass-wipe Nick Adams is back at it throwing tantrums over which restaurants and fast food joints he thinks his followers should be enjoying. The self-proclaimed ""alpha male"" was frustrated a few months ago when he claimed that inflation made it hard for like-minded dudes to go to Hooters every day.





Now he's upset over Pizza Hut allegedly ""going woke"" and vows to eat at alpha male establishment KFC instead. Why he chose KFC as the replacement for a pizza joint is beyond me but one cannot try and understand the reasoning behind his cerebral functions.





I was just about to order a pizza from Pizza Hut when I remembered that they went woke.



I will go to KFC instead. — Nick Adams (Alpha Male) (@NickAdamsinUSA) December 16 2022





Perhaps Nick's love for KFC comes from this picture of his idol Donald Trump enjoying some Kentucky fried but unfortunately for both of them KFC and Pizza Hut are owned by the same company: Yum! Brands. They also own Taco Bell.





KFC is an alpha male meal pic.twitter.com/Q7tZ8FhwDu — Pericles 'Perry' Abbasi (@ElectionLegal) December 16 2022









KFC also seems quite happy to stand for what Nick would likely categorize as ""woke"" ideals including speaking out against anti-trans discrimination and supporting Black Lives Matter.









He might have difficulty washing down his KFC too seeing as drinking a fast food soda is difficult without a straw. Especially if he gets his meal to go.









I cannot bear one more second of drinking my water through a paper straw!



It's time to take a stand! — Nick Adams (Alpha Male) (@NickAdamsinUSA) December 19 2022





Real men don't use straws. — Nick Adams (Alpha Male) (@NickAdamsinUSA) December 19 2022





Maybe he hates straws so much that he never drinks anything and by extension never has to pee. That's the only way he could ever think sitting to pee is inferior.
